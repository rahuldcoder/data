-- far - right extremist groups had been on the rise , particularly in reaction to president @entity5 's election in 2008 and the financial crisis around the same time			1
but now , hate group prevalence is taking a downward turn , according to a report released tuesday			2
the number of hate groups declined 7 % from 2012 to 2013 , the @entity10 said in the report			1
" we had four years of spectacular growth of the radical right , " said @entity14 , senior fellow at the @entity10			1
now , it " seems to be turning a corner			0
" it 's unclear whether the decline will continue , @entity14 said			2
there were 1,007 groups in 2012 and 939 last year , but those numbers are still substantially higher than in 1999 , when there were only 457 such groups			1
" @entity27 " groups in particular saw a significant drop , falling 19 % from 1,360 groups in 2012 to 1,096 in 2013			1
these anti-government groups had been strengthening in numbers substantially ; there were only 149 of them in 2008			2
the report attributed the overall declines in hate groups to factors such as @entity5 's re-election , an improving economy and law enforcement crackdowns			1
" in other words , the same groups that were galvanized by @entity5 's first election and swelled dramatically as a result , were demoralized by his re-election , which seemed to signal that their battle was lost despite enormous effort , " @entity14 wrote in the report			2
reasons for the trend mainstream politicians have also adopted right - wing extremist issues , which could be another reason for the drop			2
laws in @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 aim to stop @entity65 shariah law from being imposed on @entity67 courts , the report said , even though that could not happen under the @entity70			0
state legislatures also have passed or considered laws that try to " nullify " federal legislation , which courts have repeatedly found to be unconstitutional , the report said			0
this " nullification " idea dates to the defense of slavery before the @entity79 , resurrected " by @entity81 states resisting school desegregation and the civil rights movement			0
" extremist groups also suffered because of their own internal dynamics , the report said , citing the @entity87 , which has gone from 1,400 people to under 100 since its founder died in 2002			2
the law center attributed the decline of this group -- which used to be the best organized in @entity67 -- to " its new leader 's ineptitude and the @entity10 's exposure of a series of embarrassing secrets about the group and its leaders			1
" but although fewer groups may be active , violence and terrorism stemming from them are still very much present , @entity14 said			2
" when the groups are more out of step with public opinion , when they are weaker and more weakly led , is often when you see followers strike out violently , " he said			0
for instance , a self - described member of the @entity111 and an accomplice were arrested and charged with conspiracy to provide material support for use of a weapon of mass destruction last year , according to the criminal complaint			1
federal officials said they were planning to develop a mobile x-ray system that would be used kill people whom they deemed " undesirable			0
" feds nab @entity111 member , accomplice for lethal x-ray plot some geographic areas are more concentrated with extremist groups than others			1
@entity130 has the distinction of being the state with the most number of hate groups -- 77 -- followed by @entity135 with 58 and @entity136 with 57 , according to the @entity10 's interactive map			1
a move toward secrecy besides the obvious clash of values , there 's an emerging trend among some extremist groups that runs counter to mainstream @entity67 society : leaving the @entity146			1
in some ways , that 's not surprising , @entity14 said , because the more serious groups have always been underground			0
@entity111 groups " held steady " with 163 chapters in 2013 , but they are dampening their online presence , the report said			1
they appear to be leaving the @entity146 " in an apparent bid to regain the secrecy that marked their heyday			0
" a major specific group that ditched their digital presence is the @entity163 , which has 30 " klaverns " ( chapters ) , the report said			0
more recently , the 10 - chapter @entity167 declared that it had " gone underground so we can be more productive in our struggle			0
the only way you will be able to contact us from now on is through the old way , word of mouth , " according to the report			0
the group added , according to the report : " we are everywhere			0
" @entity0 's @entity178 contributed to this report .			0

there were 939 hate groups in 2013 , @entity10 says
that represents a 7 % decline from 2012
trend among @entity111 is leaving the internet
