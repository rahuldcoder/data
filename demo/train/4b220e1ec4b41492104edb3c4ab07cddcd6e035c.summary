@entity0 , @entity1 , is so quirky that locals just take it for granted			1
for those still operating under a normal paradigm , here are five things you will find only in @entity0 : a doughnut shop where you can get married			1
it was a sad day in @entity0 when its longtime 24 - @entity12 of @entity13 , a roving storefront art installation dispensing marriage licenses and 25 - cent pop culture trinkets , closed this summer			1
luckily , @entity17 was there to fill in the gap			2
this cash - only , 24/7 doughnut shop performs about 400 legal weddings a year			0
it was started in 2003 by @entity23 , a flamboyant one - time mayoral candidate , and @entity25 to feed the hangover crowd			0
the @entity27 eventually put the kibosh on the @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 doughnuts , but their signature voodoo doughnut lives on			0
it 's shaped like a gingerbread man and comes with a pretzel stick in the belly for stabbing and drawing blood , er , raspberry jelly			1
as for weddings , which come with coffee and doughnuts for up to 60 guests , @entity41 says his favorite involved a groom in a psychedelic suit who brought his mother in an urn			0
an ice cream counter that tops sundaes with worms			0
at the @entity56 , an art gallery , novelty shop and @entity59 © in @entity0 's @entity60 , you can pick up everything from zombie slippers and fake dog poop to plastic eyeballs to float in your gin and tonics			1
lots of people show up just to pet @entity69 ( he 's 10 feet tall , so you need a ladder ) , leave a message in the neon graffiti room or perform an autopsy on a life - size space alien			1
@entity77 sorts belly up to the ice cream counter for sundaes , hot dogs and other treats sprinkled with real bug larvae			0
tempting as it is to think " @entity86 , " the on - display ventriloquist - murdering dummy , is the mastermind behind this house of terror , it was actually started by filmmaker @entity91 and two friends			0
a museum where vacuum cleaners are out of the closet			0
@entity97 's @entity96 -- where you wo n't find crumbs , cobwebs or a single dust bunny -- will sweep you off your feet			1
more than 100 vintage vacuums from the late 1800s up to the 1960s are on display in a 10 - foot - by - 40 - foot wing of @entity97 's vacuums in downtown @entity0			1
other than during the summer of 2012 , when the @entity108 convened at this @entity109 , the little museum averages about a dozen visitors a month who come to ogle rare pre-electricity hand - pumped vacs , a cardboard model from the penny - pinching 1930s , an @entity116 on runners and a @entity118 that attaches to the ceiling			0
needless to say , the museum 's carpet is spotless			2
a city park that can fit only one person at a time			2
@entity124 , the world 's smallest , is a 2 - foot circle and , according to legend , houses the only leprechaun colony west of @entity129			1
it was dedicated on @entity131 1948 after the light pole for which it was intended never appeared			0
instead , newspaper columnist @entity134 planted flowers , and @entity136 , the colony 's so - called head leprechaun , approved , at various times , such park installations as a swimming pool for butterflies			2
it even had a diving board and a miniature @entity145			0
costumed adults who ride bikes with banana seats down a 710 - foot hill			2
not only does @entity0 have the highest number of bike commuters it the @entity152 , it has a club of self - described anarchist @entity155			1
every sunday night for 10 years , they 've picked out a bike from a jumbled pile of customized kiddie bikes near @entity160 , loaded it onto @entity0 's light rail system and rode up to the @entity162 , where they unloaded , walked up another hill and then zoomed along a designated route through @entity166			1
the weirder the costume , the funkier the bike , the better .			0

@entity0 , @entity1 , has a high quirky *quotient*
here are just five of the city 's *oddball* *activities*
stop in at the @entity176 or rest one foot in the tiny @entity124
