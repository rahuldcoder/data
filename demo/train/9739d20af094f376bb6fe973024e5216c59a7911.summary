@entity0 -- a @entity3 official says a gusher of oil pouring from its damaged @entity6 well could be shut off as early as next week			1
@entity3 managing director @entity7 said thursday night the company will pump fluids into the well this weekend in the beginning of a process that -- if successful -- could lead to the leak finally being closed off in a matter of days			1
" if that option does n't work , we 've got a second and a third option we 'll do after that , " @entity7 said on @entity1 's @entity14 on thursday			0
" we 're hopeful that next week we 'll be able to shut it off			1
" earlier in the day , @entity3 acknowledged that the underwater gusher is bigger than estimated to date , as new video showed a cloud of crude billowing around its undersea siphon			1
@entity25 spokesman @entity24 said thursday that the siphon is now drawing about 5,000 barrels ( 210,000 gallons ) per day up to a ship on the surface of the @entity6 -- as much as government and company officials had estimated the spill was pouring into the @entity6 every day for a month			0
@entity24 declined to estimate how much more oil was escaping			2
@entity3 chairman @entity3 said wednesday that the figure used by the oil spill response team had a degree of " uncertainty " built into it			1
but figures by independent researchers have run up to many times higher : @entity41 , a professor of mechanical engineering at @entity43 , told @entity1 's " @entity45 " that the spill could be as big as 20,000 to 100,000 barrels a day			0
and members of @entity47 released video from the company that showed much more oil pouring out of the damaged well than the siphon was capturing			2
rep. @entity52 , who leads a @entity54 subcommittee investigating the disaster , told reporters , " i think now we are beginning to understand that we can not trust @entity3			1
" " people do not trust the experts any longer , " said @entity52 , @entity58			0
" @entity3 has lost all credibility			1
now the decisions will have to be made by others , because it is clear that they have been hiding the actual consequences of this spill			0
" meanwhile , the @entity67 announced the creation of a federal @entity69 to assess the actual flow rate from the well			1
@entity67 capt. @entity72 said that adm. @entity73 would oversee the team , which will include members from the @entity67 , the @entity76 , the @entity77 , the @entity78 , the @entity80 @entity79 and others from the science community and academia			1
the peer - reviewed team , which has already begun its work , is to determine the flow rate from the beginning of the incident to the present , @entity72 said			1
the @entity90 administration announced thursday that it has ordered @entity3 to release all data related to the massive spill , including environmental sampling analyses , internal investigation reports and details of the cleanup effort			1
in a letter to @entity3 ceo @entity98 , homeland security secretary @entity99 and @entity101 administrator @entity100 told @entity3 to post that information on a website and update it daily			1
" the public and the @entity80 government are entitled to nothing less than complete transparency in this matter , " they concluded			0
the spill began with an april 20 explosion and fire that sank the drill rig @entity114 two days later			0
eleven workers were lost with the rig , which was owned by drilling contractor @entity117 and hired by @entity3			1
the resulting slick now threatens the coastal marshes of southeastern @entity119 , where brown , syrupy oil made it past protective booms and into the wetlands near the mouth of the @entity125 on wednesday			1
over the weekend , @entity3 inserted a piece of pipe into the larger of the two leak points and began drawing oil from the undersea gusher , located about a mile underwater , up to a ship on the surface			1
it also has been laying booms out along barrier islands and spraying hundreds of thousands of gallons of chemical dispersants on the surface and near the sources of the leak			2
but that element of the response came under new fire as well on thursday , as the @entity101 ordered @entity3 to find a less toxic chemical to use to break up the oil			1
the @entity101 gave the company a day to pick a new substance and three days to start using it instead of the current dispersant , known as @entity149			2
the chemical has been rated more toxic and less effective than many others on the list of 18 @entity101 - approved dispersants , according to testimony at a congressional hearing wednesday			1
" because of its use in unprecedented volumes and because much is unknown about the underwater use of dispersants , @entity101 wants to ensure @entity3 is using the least toxic product authorized for use , " the agency said in a statement announcing the order			1
" we reserve the right to discontinue the use of this dispersant method if any negative impacts on the environment outweigh the benefits			0
" @entity149 includes petroleum distillates , propylene glycol and a proprietary organic sulfonic salt , and prolonged contact with it can cause eye or skin irritation , according to the manufacturer 's material data safety sheet			0
the document warns that " repeated or prolonged exposure may irritate the respiratory tract			0
" but @entity3 says @entity149 is biodegradable , has been approved by the @entity101 and the @entity67 and is " readily available in the quantities required " by a response plan approved by the government before the spill			1
@entity187 : track the spill ; share stories " it has been very effective in causing the oil to form into small , isolated droplets that remain suspended until they 're either eaten by naturally occurring microbes , evaporate , are picked up or dissolve , " the company said			2
but it added , " at the same time , we are conducting ongoing assessment of alternative or supplemental dispersant products			2
" meanwhile , @entity3 is readying a new attempt to plug the leak for sunday by injecting a large amount of heavy " mud " -- a fluid used as a lubricant and counterweight in drilling operations -- into the well bore			2
if that succeeds , the well will be cemented shut , officials have said			2
" everything is being done to make sure that happens , " interior secretary @entity211 , whose department oversees offshore oil drilling , told @entity1 's " @entity45 " thursday			0
" we have the best scientists in the world who are overseeing what is going on			0
so , we are hopeful that it will happen soon			0
" @entity211 said @entity3 , which leased the rig from @entity117 , has tried many techniques to stop the leaking and the government will do all in its power to hold them accountable			2
" they 're putting a lot of hope on that sunday , " he said			0
" we 'll see if it happens			0
" @entity211 announced wednesday that he was dividing the @entity230 's @entity76 , which regulates oil exploration , into three divisions			0
the agency has come under fire since long before the spill , and @entity236 said it would be reorganized to separate what he called the conflicting duties of regulating oil companies and collecting royalties from them			0
" we inherited here what was a legacy of an agency that essentially was rubber - stamping whatever it was that the oil and gas industry wanted , " @entity211 said			0
" we have been on a reform agenda from @entity247			0
" @entity1 's @entity248 , @entity249 and @entity250 contributed to this report .			0
