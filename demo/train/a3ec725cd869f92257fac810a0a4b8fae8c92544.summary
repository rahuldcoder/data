@entity1 his weeks - long stay in @entity4 largely uninterrupted by major news , president @entity0 flies back to a redrawn @entity6 late saturday prepared for a renewed economic push he hopes will set up a productive final presidential quarter			1
he faces an uphill battle : newly powerful republicans take control of both chambers of @entity14 next week , and the nation 's political attention will quickly turn to the next presidential contest as candidates declare their intentions in the next few months			2
expecting to receive @entity21 - passed measures gutting his health care law , approving the @entity23 , and undoing his executive actions , @entity0 has said he 's ready to wield veto power that 's largely been unused during his presidency			1
but his aides say @entity0 is hoping to avoid a year of reaction focused solely on rebutting the @entity21			1
instead , the @entity29 says , he 'll look to present an affirmative agenda that builds upon the nation 's economic gains			0
on areas like tax reform and trade , @entity0 has said he 's open to working with @entity21 , who made major gains in november 's elections and now control the @entity38			1
but administration officials say they 're not under any illusions that @entity21 in the next @entity14 will be more willing to work with @entity0 than those in the last			1
that means the go - it - alone strategy of last year , which relied on unilateral action to exact change , has n't been completely retired , officials say			0
in a bid to jump start the year 's governing — and exploit momentum following the raft of late - 2014 executive actions — @entity0 next week will start a three - week preview period for his late - january @entity54 address			1
@entity0 's chief speechwriter , @entity55 , was kept busy drafting the annual speech while along with @entity0 for his @entity4 vacation			2
the president will make targeted stops in @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 next week to promote , respectively , advances in the @entity60 auto industry , housing gains , and his education platform			1
the @entity29 said during @entity0 's tour he would promote both executive actions and proposals for legislation			0
" the president is eager to get to work , and looks forward to working with the new @entity14 on policies that will make sure middle class @entity60 are sharing in the economic recovery , " said @entity72 , a @entity29 spokesman			0
" there are a number of issues we could make progress on , but the president is clear that he will not let this @entity14 undo important protections gained - particularly in areas of health care , @entity87 reform and the environment , " @entity77 said			2
@entity0 has only vetoed two measures in his six years in office , though @entity29 officials expect that to change quickly as @entity21 assume power on @entity93			1
one of the first measures lawmakers will debate is a bill approving the controversial @entity23 pipeline , which environmentalists oppose			0
the @entity29 has suggested it would reject any measure from @entity14 approving the pipeline , since the review process in place at the @entity102 is still underway			0
areas of compromise exist : both @entity21 and @entity0 say they 're interested in overhauling the corporate tax structure and pushing through major trade deals with @entity107 and @entity108			1
but those projects face opposition from @entity111 , who worry they could favor large companies over working class @entity60			0
" we certainly hope they work with @entity14 instead of continuing to campaign against it , " said @entity115 , a spokesman for the incoming senate majority leader @entity116			0
" but remember , the biggest hangup on things like trade has been the president 's own party			0
they oppose entitlement reform , trade , revenue neutral tax reform			0
" @entity115 said that could mean @entity0 is forced to spend negotiating time with both @entity21 and @entity111 — " something he 's been reluctant to do			2

president @entity0 arrives back in @entity6 with the @entity133 under @entity21 control
@entity0 will soon start a three - week preview period for his @entity54 address
the president will make stops in @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 next week
