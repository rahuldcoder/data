-- it was just after lunchtime , and 17 kindergartners huddled around a table marked with paint			0
teacher @entity6 held a vase covered in small objects : an " i < @entity15 " keychain , a @entity11 flag and other goodies the students brought from home			2
it might seem like any art class , but the students ' piece was inspired by the work of folk artist @entity21			0
the children knew about his colorful , eclectic art because they 'd seen them up close that day at the @entity26 in @entity27			1
this , their teachers said , is the kind of learning that happens only when schools cut out the classroom and take learning on the road			1
in late february , students from the independent , private @entity37 in @entity27 spent the entire school day inside the museum			1
it was closed to the public but wide open to @entity43 's 750 students , ages 3 to 18 , for a day of " school without walls			1
" this was no ordinary field trip , school leaders said			1
a museum visit typically means a bus ride , a few hours for students to observe the same exhibit , and a lot of reminders to stay quiet and not touch anything			1
on this day , hundreds of students , teachers and staff members flooded the museum , wearing white t - shirts with red logos that read " high energy			1
" movement and noise filled the wings as teachers and students explored lessons in art , music , history , geometry , physics -- all of them designed by teachers in collaboration with the museum 's education department			1
the experience pushed the boundaries of the usual field trip , @entity83 @entity82 said , even in an era when many schools are cutting trips entirely			1
the school was " rethinking about it as a carnival of learning , " @entity82 said			1
" there will be chaos , and that belongs to experiential learning , and that is what we 're looking for			0
we 're looking for a hubbub of activity and student inquiry			0
" teaching from reality the idea for the " school without walls " started simply , with a meeting of the @entity37 leader and the museum director			2
by allowing students to visit on a monday , when the museum is typically closed , they could assure more freedom and security for students while still relying on the education and catering staff , they decided			2
teachers visited during a professional development day and worked with the museum 's education department to design courses that paired existing exhibits with lessons their students would need even in their regular classrooms			1
the final schedule spanned 87 sessions for students in pre-k through high school , far more than could be offered during a standard school day , sometimes allowing teachers to break out of their typical subject matter			1
at the museum , @entity43 health and physical education teacher @entity133 led a session about the civil rights movement called " walking in @entity138			2
" @entity140 's students searched for shapes in the museum and wrote riddles that incorporated math vocabulary			2
@entity82 , the school leader , explored the color blue with young students			2
museum workers pitched in , too : director @entity148 analyzed work by @entity151 bronze artist @entity150 while @entity152 explained the business model for museums			0
" teachers had to think outside the box , teach from real things , teach in different ways than they have before , so it 's a big growth experience for them , " said @entity155 , director of education at the @entity26			0
" the difference is that students get to see the real thing up close and personal , and they get to connect all of that background learning to the real thing			2
" read : students , say goodbye to snow days it did n't take long for teachers to zero in on unique learning opportunities or for students to break out of a desk - and - classroom mindset			1
" they 're much more excited by the learning , so it 'll stick with them more , " teacher @entity173 said			0
the hardest part , some teachers said , was to remember what to pack : without their usual classroom supplies available , they had to plan ahead			0
" we kept being like , ' oh , we need to get this			0
oh , we need to pack that , ' " @entity140 said			0
the value of a field trip gas costs , budget cuts and jam - packed school days loaded with tests have all cut back on field trips that used to dot educational calendars			1
but if schools find a willing partner , they could easily replicate the idea behind the " school with no walls , " @entity155 said			2
some schools are turning to technology , using @entity200 or @entity201 to take students to faraway places they could n't otherwise go			2
but even visits to local cultural institutions can hold tangible educational value , said @entity207 , an education reform researcher at the @entity209			0
in a recent study involving nearly 11,000 students from 123 schools , he found that students who visited the @entity214 in @entity215 , @entity216 , demonstrated stronger critical thinking skills , higher levels of social tolerance and greater historical empathy than those who did n't			1
they also developed a taste for art museums and cultural institutions			0
he found that benefits were even greater for students who came from high poverty or rural schools , minority students and those who had never before visited a museum			1
those students are especially reliant on their schools to provide those experiences , he said			2
some have come to see field trips and time in cultural institutions as " unnecessary frills , " @entity207 said , that slice away at time needed to maximize test scores			1
he says they 're not			0
" schools certainly have to deal with tight budgets , but they also have to prioritize different ways of spending their resources , " @entity207 said			0
" if school leaders are able to see the benefits of these types of trips , they might be able to prioritize them			2
" @entity207 had n't heard of other schools hosting entire days of school at museums , but some programs are trying to emphasize learning outside the classroom , like the @entity256 in @entity257 and @entity258 in @entity259 , he said			1
" it 's a great thing that should be replicated and serve as a model for other institutions and schools looking to expand the types of learning that they 're doing for their students , " he said			1
read : would you want @entity200 in your child 's school ? @entity270 , a former public school teacher who 's now the director of communications for the @entity37 , said she can understand why some schools would be reluctant to try an entire school day away from the classroom : worry about " what - ifs " can get in the way of experiments , she said			1
" there 's an element of fear , whether it 's an independent or a public school , that they have to stay within the lines when working with kids , " she said			0
" you do n't have to be bound by these artificial lines when it comes to educating kids			0
" nourishing the learning process throughout the day , the museum was busy not with the usual crowds but with fifth - graders stretching in their movement class , sixth - graders pounding drums and first - graders painting polygons on t - shirts			1
cutting out the classroom took some getting used to for some students			0
first - grader @entity300 commented that he liked the size and variety of shapes inside the museum , while his classmate @entity305 said he preferred their regular classroom because it " feels like more time at school			1
" sixth - graders @entity309 and @entity311 , who went to sessions about @entity313 , music and photography , agreed that the museum took them outside their comfort zones			2
" at school , we 've been there forever , and we know it like the back of our hand , but here you get to explore and see new things you 've never seen before , " @entity309 said			0
" i got to see a lot of new students i have n't worked with and their outlooks on the art , " @entity311 said			0
read : how one teacher is innovating his classroom some high school students enjoyed the environment , but with their minds already geared toward college , a day in the museum did n't always help much			1
high school freshman @entity337 said he saw some limitations to the event			0
he and his classmates are used to to the speed of laptops and other technology to move them efficiently through material , and with some students minds ' already on college , they struggled to connect with the offerings			0
personally , he enjoyed the challenge			0
" in school , you 're really just sitting down in a chair getting exercises drilled into your head , but this really allowed creative flow , " said @entity349 , 15			0
" the main idea of school is to prepare someone for life , and the best way to do that is to not have the same environment			0
experimenting with different environments gives students a sense of a new area and working and learning in different ways			2
" " @entity370 , " he said , " nourishes the learning process			0
" has your school cut back on field trips , or found new ways to give students hands - on experiences ? share your thoughts in the comments , on @entity381 or on @entity384 's @entity383 page !			1

gas costs , budget cuts and test *pressures* have led some schools to cut field trips
one @entity27 school took all its 750 students to a museum as a one - day learning experiment
