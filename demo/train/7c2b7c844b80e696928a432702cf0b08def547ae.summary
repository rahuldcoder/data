-- ethnic @entity2 ' ability to thrive in high altitudes with low oxygen is the fastest genetic change ever observed in humans , according to a study published friday in the journal @entity9			1
researchers at the @entity11 said their comparison of the genomes of ethnic @entity2 and @entity14 could help scientists understand how the body deals with decreased oxygen and diseases associated with oxygen deprivation in the womb , according to a news release on the university 's website			2
the evolutionary biologists say the results of their study , which compares the genomes of 50 @entity2 and 40 @entity14 , shows that @entity2 rapidly developed a unique ability to survive in altitudes above 13,000 feet , where oxygen levels are about 40 percent lower than at sea level			0
the study said that @entity2 evolved to adapt to high altitudes after splitting off from the @entity14 about 2,750 years ago			1
the study identified more than 30 genes with dna mutations that have become more prevalent in @entity2 than @entity14 , nearly half of which are related to how the body uses oxygen			0
" for such a very strong change , a lot of people would have had to die simply due to the fact that they had the wrong version of a gene , " said @entity39 , a professor of integrative biology at @entity11 who led the statistical analysis .			0

ethnic *tibetans* took less than 3,000 years to adapt to high altitudes , study says
professor : adaptation is fastest genetic change ever observed in humans
study compares genomes of ethnic @entity2 and @entity14
evolution allows @entity2 to thrive in high - altitude areas , researchers say
