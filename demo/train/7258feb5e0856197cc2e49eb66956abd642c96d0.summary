-- at the 2008 @entity3 summit in @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity1 told a surprised @entity6 , " you have to understand , @entity6 , that @entity8 is not even a country			2
part of its territory is in @entity13 and the greater part was given to us			0
" six years later , the @entity16 appears to be making sure that @entity1 's opinion becomes a reality			1
for @entity20 , the drama that has been unfolding in @entity8 for the past three months is a domestic and an international issue			0
after all , if a revolution can unseat an unpopular , corrupt government in @entity25 , why not in @entity20 ? follow the latest developments in @entity8 that was @entity20 's nightmare scenario during the @entity29 , and it remains a major concern even though @entity1 's popularity rating in @entity32 runs at a healthy 60 % today			1
beyond that , @entity8 is closely linked to @entity32 's return to the world stage as a great power that should be entitled to a " sphere of privileged interests " in its backyard			1
@entity1 has said that the collapse of the @entity41 was the " greatest geopolitical tragedy " of the 20th century			2
his project for his third term as president is to gather in as many of his neighbors as he can to form a new @entity47			0
@entity8 is the key to that project			0
and @entity50 is the key to @entity8			2
sixty years ago , @entity41 leader @entity52 " gave " the @entity50 -- for the previous 300 years part of the @entity32 empire and the @entity41 -- to the @entity55 because they were all part of the @entity41 and it was meant as a symbolic gesture			1
after the @entity41 collapse , @entity50 suddenly became part of an independent @entity8 to @entity20 's shock			2
@entity20 and @entity25 worked out a deal to divide the @entity41 @entity63 between @entity32 and @entity8			1
in 2010 , @entity8 extended the @entity32 lease until 2042			0
when @entity8 president @entity65 was ousted last week and fled to @entity32 , the @entity16 worried it might lose its lease and have to withdraw its fleet from this strategic area			0
the initial @entity32 move to occupy @entity50 was designed to protect @entity32 naval equities on the @entity50			1
some 60 % of @entity50 's population is @entity32 and appears to support the current @entity32 occupation			1
but @entity32 interests and troops reach beyond that			2
opinion : the two @entity77 a key @entity1 goal since he came to power in 2000 has been to prevent either @entity3 or the @entity80 from encroaching in the post-soviet space			2
that 's why @entity32 offered @entity65 a $ 15 billion loan to counter the @entity47 's more modest offer in december			2
by occupying @entity50 , @entity32 wants to ensure that only a rump @entity8 could negotiate with the @entity47 in the future			1
if the current conflict does not spread to other parts of eastern @entity8 -- where there is a sizable population that is demanding closer ties to @entity32 -- then @entity50 could join the ranks of other " frozen conflicts " in the post-soviet space			1
these entities with substantial @entity32 - speaking populations exist in de facto ministates with @entity32 military protection within the borders of a larger state whose jurisdiction they do not recognize , such as the @entity105 region in @entity106			0
@entity32 support for these breakaway regions ensures that @entity106 , @entity109 and now @entity8 will not enjoy full sovereignty over their territory and that @entity32 will always have a role to play there			0
occupying @entity50 and raising tensions in eastern @entity8 to prevent @entity8 from moving toward more @entity116 influence is a top priority for the @entity16			1
the @entity55 stakes are far higher for @entity20 than they are for either @entity119 or @entity120			0
the @entity121 can threaten economic sanctions , expel @entity32 from the @entity123 and consider a range of other measures , but the @entity16 must have already discounted these possible countermeasures well before it executed its carefully planned takeover of @entity50			1
if maintaining a good relationship with the @entity121 were a top priority for @entity1 , he would not have granted @entity121 intel leaker @entity132 asylum in august			0
guaranteeing and expanding the @entity32 presence in @entity50 is much more important			1
opinion : how @entity1 carries out power grab given @entity32 's determination not to back down from @entity50 , the @entity121 and its allies will have to focus on containing the advance of @entity32 troops beyond @entity50 and trying to ensure that an unanticipated local conflict between groups under the control neither of @entity20 nor @entity25 could not precipitate a broader armed struggle in @entity8			1
the fragile interim government in @entity25 will need substantial economic support and must be encouraged not to let itself be provoked into a war with @entity32 as @entity109 was in 2008			0
because if there were an armed conflict , neither the @entity121 nor @entity3 would get militarily involved , and the result could be the dismemberment of @entity8 and its division into two states on either side of a new @entity155 divide			0
join us on @entity158 / @entity157			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity161 .			0

@entity161 : @entity1 's move into @entity50 is central to his view of @entity32 's interests
key to those interests is the @entity32 @entity63 based in @entity50
stent says that beyond sanctions and containment , @entity116 *reaction* may be limited
