-- 1914 was a good year for poster design			1
you 'd be forgiven for not knowing it was then that five of the world 's top poster designers were born : @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11			1
though they were from different backgrounds and worked separately , the five are largely responsible for bringing modernist design and typeface sensibilities to the world of poster design from the 1940s on			1
" it was a sort of @entity21 of the poster , " says legendary letterpress designer @entity19			1
while their names have all but slipped from public memory , a new project from @entity27 and @entity28 , one of the world 's leading typeface design companies , is shining a new light on their revolutionary poster work , 100 years after their birth			1
the results : a series of posters fusing each designer 's style with @entity27 's , and " @entity19 and @entity28 : celebrating the centenary of five pioneers of the poster , " an exhibition at the @entity44 for the @entity45 , that will showcase @entity19 's work alongside posters from each designers ' estate			1
the artist at work i meet @entity19 at his workshop near the @entity44			1
the smell of ink and metal hits you at the door , growing stronger as you move closer to the intimidating printing press in the back			0
prints of his work — eye - popping text images in rainbow hues — hang from the walls , the ceiling , a drying line			1
the hundreds of typeface alphabets he 's made and amassed over the years ( the largest collection in @entity73 ) , from indecipherably small metal nubs to wooden letters the size of a man 's forearm , are filed away in stacked tiers , and leaned against walls			0
his only computer is a first - generation macbook he uses to check emails			0
over the last 50 years , @entity27 has built a reputation as one of the world 's most acclaimed letterpress designers			2
and like the designers he 's commemorating , he 's inspired by the beauty of type			0
" the printed word is still powerful , " he says			0
" i wanted to take letterpress technology and move it somewhere else from when it used to be useful			2
" this dedication to type as art is evident in the prints he created for the collaboration			2
the colorful posters meld @entity19 's penchant for monograms ( " i like that idea of monograms : two letters interacting to make a third image , " ) with each designer 's spirit			1
their influences resonate like a baseline : games ' initials feature the bold font made famous by his posters for the @entity117 ( the women 's branch of the @entity120 army ) during @entity121 ; @entity11 's feature the colorful simplicity that he would later bring to children 's books			1
posters , now and then @entity19 is quick to distinguish his posters from those being commemorated			1
while he has done functional posters , most of his have been designed as prints , strictly things of beauty			2
but earlier in the 20th - century , when the designers were first breaking ground in graphic design , posters were society 's primary form of communication			1
" there were no other means of getting your message out there then			0
it was just posters , " he says			0
in a time before the ubiquity of photography ( let alone @entity152 ) , good design was paramount			2
it was all about the " interpretation of an idea in a graphic way			2
" for these artists , this interpretation was realized through geometric shapes , meaningful text and inventive use of color			2
the diversity of their work proved these principles could be applied for almost any cause , from @entity7 's simple - but - effective posters for the @entity169 , to @entity11 and @entity171 's branding work for @entity172 and @entity173 respectively ; from @entity113 ' provocative war propaganda to @entity10 's geometric orchestra adverts			1
" there 's nothing between the message and the image			0
at a glance , you 've got it			0
you did n't need a lot of words			0
the image is the message , " @entity19 says			1
" that 's what they were masters of : condensing down a problem to a single cool item with bang			0
" the public generally responded positively ( @entity113 ' @entity196 posters were universal favorites ) , but each designer received their share of push - back			2
one of @entity113 ' @entity117 recruitment posters was recalled after only a few weeks because authorities thought the glamorous woman shown sent the wrong message about the war effort , and another depicting a young boy in poverty was banned by @entity208 himself for being too negative			0
the others ' posters were derided for being too strange , too modern , and too ugly			0
" a lot of people did n't recognize the things they did , " @entity19 explains			1
" they thought they were too advanced , too modern because they were working ahead of their time , really			0
" yet somehow their legacy survives			0
the end of an era much has changed since @entity7 , games , @entity9 , @entity222 , and @entity11 elevated the poster to high art. changing technology has rendered their methods obsolete , and posters have had to become more brash and stylized to keep the public 's attention			1
" a lot of things today have very fleeting life			0
it comes out quickly and it certainly does n't last that long , " @entity19 says			1
but the appeal of these modernist designs , now decades old , remains			2
posters that were quite common during their time now sell for exorbitant prices at auction			0
and to @entity27 and other designers , they are a vestige of another time when a handful of great designers ruled supreme			0
" they were regarded as the high professional designers of the world , " @entity19 says			1
" even now , people look back at them and say , ' that was a great time to be doing posters			0
' " @entity19 will be speaking about the designers at five lives in posters : a @entity258 at the @entity44 on september 18 , 2014			1
intoxicating investment : how some whisky lovers are now making millions ' time - slice ' photos capture beautiful landmarks , from sunrise to sunset astonishing sculptures made from nothing but plain paper			0
