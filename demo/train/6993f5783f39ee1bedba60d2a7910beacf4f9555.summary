-- ten years ago , small groups of people worked feverishly on the next great revolution in digital media			1
it was going to be wireless			1
only most people did n't know that at the time			2
some of us thought it was coming but could not be sure			1
it was a time of great excitement and uncertainty			2
for a time during that hot summer of 2002 , i worked long hours in a nondescript office building in the suburbs of @entity17 with a handful of pioneers on a coming app store : @entity21			1
i was working on mobile for the @entity23 , and we were trying to get weather radar maps to appear on phones for the first time			1
would people want them ? what levels of zoom should we choose ? would the wireless networks be strong enough ? meanwhile , in @entity33 and other @entity35 countries , early content services and app stores such as i - mode were paving the way			1
across @entity41 , text messaging was skyrocketing , but not in the @entity42 in the same way			2
even " @entity48 , " launched in june 2002 , did not allow viewers to choose the winner by text message until the next season			2
@entity49 , basically browsing on a phone , had been around for a few years but had not hit its stride			1
the browsing experience involved small screens with mostly grayscale text displaying basic information such as weather , sports scores and news headlines			2
@entity21 launched a number of new apps in august 2002 , including our app from the @entity23 , that media company 's first downloadable app for a mobile phone			1
at the time , we thought it was a big deal , but it clearly was an experiment , and we were n't sure it would work			1
unlike most apps today , it was n't free			1
@entity72 starts to take off other @entity42 carriers were also launching app stores with news , sports , weather and games			0
at the same time , some early adopters pulled out a @entity80 , @entity81 or @entity82 pda to check e-mail			0
and pagers had not totally disappeared from the marketplace			0
by 2006 , the mobile web was growing stronger thanks to the emergence of better phones such as the @entity90 and handsets from @entity92 and @entity93			1
fast - forward to 2008 , the year after the @entity95 's debut			0
larger groups of people at media companies , wireless carriers , handset manufacturers and games companies were jumping in			1
those of us in the digital media industry were pivoting from " will mobile be a big deal ? " to " how big will it be ? " that first app for @entity109 provided a healthy revenue stream for the @entity23 for several years and was accompanied by mobile web , video and messaging services by 2008			1
when the @entity23 was sold to an investor group led by @entity116 in 2008 , mobile was a major area of interest in the acquisition			1
that same year , @entity120 and @entity121 were starting to turn the world of mobile handsets upside - down with their groundbreaking new app stores			1
as apps became mainstream , people routinely listened to music , played games , checked e-mail and tapped news and info on their phones			1
co-workers were frequently asking me when the next release of an @entity95 or @entity137 app would hit the market			0
for some of us , mobile had moved from the kids ' table to the grownups ' table			1
mobile products also became central to a company 's brand image , and they started to contribute in important ways to financial success			2
i like to tell people that my first four years working on mobile at the @entity23 were spent trying to persuade people not to turn out the lights and that my last four years were trying to figure out how big mobile could be			1
in july 2009 , i moved to @entity0 for the exciting opportunity to build out its mobile business			2
redefining business today , companies like @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity0 rely on mobile for their futures			1
people often find it more effective to interact with others via text than via voice or e-mail			0
products like @entity171 and @entity172 have joined the new mobility nobility			0
media companies around the world are seeing their businesses redefined			1
for example , what is a tv today ? is it really just a big stationary box in the corner of a room ? what is a magazine ? is it really just a bunch of impactful pictures accompanied by text on glossy paper ? and what is a website ? is it really a site designed for people who browse on a pc ? when we as consumers look for a site on a phone , we now often expect content that is easy to read and watch on a phone			0
and who is the big winner ? consumers and organizations worldwide who embrace the change and see it for what it is : a change every bit as big as the advent of the telegraph , radio , television and @entity81			0
who loses , or at minimum misses , an opportunity ? it 's those who do n't realize that phones and tablets are a fundamental change in terms of the ways that people interact with their world			2
this mobile movement constitutes one of the most profound changes in consumer behavior in our lifetime			2
we see changes in many facets of our lives , from how we interact with others to where we eat , where we meet , how we experience a visit to the doctor , how we pay bills and what we know about the last play in a football game			0
today , @entity0 is launching " @entity245 , " an initiative that will explore this sea change in our lives			0
we 're telling this story across at least four screens : @entity250 , pc , tablet and phone			0
please tell us what you think			0
go to cnn.com / ourmobilesociety or to the " @entity245 " section of the @entity0 apps for @entity95 , @entity257 , @entity137 and @entity258			2
read the articles , watch the videos , and please comment if you like			0
submit an @entity261 ( from your phone , of course )			0
subscribe to our @entity172 accounts , including @ @entity265 for breaking news , and @ @entity267 and @ @entity268			0
let us know how we can serve you better			0
@entity0 is dedicated to embracing the mobile medium and being as bold in it as we have been in tv cable news ( launched in 1980 ) and the pc - based web ( in 1995 )			2
about every 15 years , there is a major revolution that enables us to live up to our convictions at @entity0			1
thinking back to that summer in @entity17 building the weather app , we knew what we were doing could be big			0
but we did n't know how big			0
we had no way to know when some of the transformational milestones would occur			0
many of the answers now unfold in front of us , in our daily lives			0
at least two things are certain : it 's only going to get bigger , and the change affects nearly everyone .			0

ten years ago , i was working on mobile apps for the @entity23
we thought a wireless revolution might be coming but could not be sure
