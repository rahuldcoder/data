@entity0 -- is a third term of @entity3 as @entity5 chancellor good for @entity6 ? @entity3 has emerged from the weekend 's elections with the @entity9 's biggest vote for 20 years			1
she now has a strong mandate to form a government in which she would serve as chancellor			1
the @entity9 is now likely to negotiate a " grand coalition " with the @entity14 after the pro-business @entity15 , @entity3 's previous coalition partner , failed to pass the 5 % threshold for getting into parliament			1
@entity3 's return gives the country consistent leadership during a time in which the future of the euro has come under question , amid the economic problems of its laggard members			1
while @entity30 has emerged from the crisis with its economy relatively intact , nations such as @entity29 have entered deep recessions while unemployment has soared			1
read more : @entity6 's mrs @entity36 in this context , a healthy @entity30 is regarded as a help rather than hindrance for @entity6			2
the markets welcomed @entity3 's re-election and the expectation it will provide a steady approach to the financial crisis			1
@entity6 has begun to show signs of recovery , and disruption would not be welcome			0
but @entity3 does face challenges			2
a grand coalition will require her to make concessions that may impact her plans			0
in 2005 it took almost a month to negotiate a coalition -- so there could be weeks of uncertainty in @entity6 markets before the government is actually formed			0
will there be more bailouts under a @entity3 coalition ? @entity30 and @entity29 have both acknowledged the latter will require further financial assistance			1
the @entity65 - led bailout for @entity29 is due to expire next year , leaving the nation with a financial shortfall of around 14 billion euros			0
@entity29 , which has already received two bailouts , may find itself facing more conditions as it seeks a third round of aid from its @entity6 peers			0
@entity73 , which has been bailed out once , is expected to face problems if it attempts to return to the bond markets			0
as a result , bailouts and haircuts are likely to remain on the agenda for @entity3 's third term even as the eurozone enters a recovery phase			1
in photos : rising to the top the nascent pan-eurozone banking union and other pillars of @entity6 's rescue package -- like the legal use of the @entity90 's pledge to support ailing nations through " outright monetary transactions " -- are other issues that will need to be settled			2
@entity3 's strengthened mandate could also mean a stronger position on fiscal restraint and austerity across @entity6			1
@entity3 is convinced , in the longer term , healthier balance sheets will leave the region better off -- but in the short term it may mean more cuts			2
what about the euroskeptics vote ? @entity30 's euroskeptic party @entity105 -- which is opposed to the single currency and wants the country to exit the eurozone -- did not get past the 5 % threshold required to usher it into the @entity112 , or lower house of @entity30 's parliament			1
it did , however , gain 4.5 % of the vote			0
so , while major anti-euro policy plays are out , noise will increase around @entity30 's role in @entity6 , and any benefits it gets from being in the single currency			1
how will a third term of @entity3 influence the @entity5 economy ? @entity3 's stewardship of the @entity5 economy has been good for the country , but not for all of its citizens			1
since she was first elected in 2005 , @entity3 has steered a steady course , shielding @entity5 output from the worst of the financial crisis			2
this is reflected in upbeat readings for business confidence and a 75 % appreciation for the @entity134 , the nation 's main bluechip stock index			0
while unemployment soared in the eurozone and in the @entity140 after 2008 , @entity30 's jobless tally decreased			1

however , large numbers of people are reliant on low - paid " mini-jobs " which leave them struggling to make ends meet			0
the @entity151 are calling for a national minimum wage to combat the problem of the " working poor			0
" the @entity154 warned recently that the gap between rich and poor in @entity30 was wider than in any of the group 's member states , which include the @entity140 and @entity158			2
how did @entity3 survive while the rest fell ? as only the third person in post-war times to win three terms in office -- joining @entity164 and @entity165 -- @entity3 has cemented her place in the history books			2
she is now positioned to topple @entity168 from the top spot as most powerful female politician of all time			0
her style has been bred from her upbringing under communist rule in @entity30			2
the ever - present secret police -- the @entity176 -- taught her the importance of discretion and knowing when to speak up or not			0
her background in the sciences fed her analytical mind , and she is methodical and logical in solving problems			0
read more : is @entity30 playing beggar - my neighbor ? there are no frivolities or bouts of superfluous charisma for " @entity191 " or " @entity192 , as she is called in @entity30			0
@entity3 has risen to the top quietly , almost modestly			0
it has made her one of the most popular -- if plain -- politicians @entity30 has known since @entity197 @entity3 has been careful to keep her famously steely resolve and intransigence for @entity199 , to defend @entity30 's interests			1
and for this she has been rewarded			0
as the eurozone 's existential crisis claimed the scalps of the region 's more boisterous leaders , like @entity207 's @entity206 , @entity209 's @entity208 and @entity211 's @entity210 , the queen of consistency outrode them all .			1

@entity3 has made big gains in @entity30 's election , and has a mandate to form a government
her return signals a consistent approach to the eurozone 's crisis control
a strengthened mandate means she may *insist* on more cuts as some euro nations struggle
while the crisis has claimed the scalps of more boisterous leaders , @entity3 's consistency has kept her in power
