-- police in @entity2 were working wednesday to uncover the motive behind a gunman 's midnight attack that left one person dead and another wounded at the victory rally by @entity9 's newly elected premier			1
@entity10 was speaking to excited supporters near midnight tuesday when the man , dressed in what appeared to be a bathrobe and face mask and armed with two guns , slipped into the @entity2 concert hall and opened fire			2
he then set a small fire at the venue 's back door , police said			0
amid the chaos , @entity10 ' security team hustled her off stage			2
she was not injured , but one person died and another was wounded , according to police			0
minutes later , the 63 - year - old returned to thank her supporters and asked the crowd to calmly leave the room			0
police said wednesday they were trying to determine whether @entity10 was the intended target of the gunman , who was arrested moments after the attack			1
authorities took the 62 - year - old suspect to the hospital after his arrest for what police described as an ailment that did not appear to be serious			2
police would not release the suspect 's name until he appears in court , they said , which is not likely before thursday afternoon			2
authorities also have not yet released the identity of the dead shooting victim , saying family members may not yet have been notified			0
the second shooting victim suffered non-life threatening injuries , according to @entity2 police commander @entity56			2
while it 's not clear what the motive for the attack may have been , the man shouted " the @entity65 are waking up ! " in @entity63 as he was being taken to a police cruiser			1
@entity10 ' party , @entity66 , wants the @entity63 - speaking province to secede from @entity68 and become its own country			1
@entity10 and her party defeated the incumbent @entity72 party in the elections , unseating longtime premier @entity74 and making her the province 's first female leader			1
" as a result of this tragedy , it is all the @entity66 who are grieving today in the face of such a senseless act of violence , " @entity10 said in a statement released by the party			1
she said elections , not violence , should guide @entity9 's future			0
@entity10 said she saw little of the incident that prompted her security detail to whisk her off the stage and was not aware one shooting victim had died until later			1
she downplayed suggestions that the campaign had anything to do with the incident			0
" i do n't think there is a relation between the events of yesterday and the style of our campaign , " she said			0
@entity9 voters first elected a separatist government in 1976 , and since that time the province has quarreled with the @entity65 - speaking majority in the rest of @entity68 over its position in the country			1
@entity9 voters have twice rejected referendums supporting sovereignty for the province , the last time in a closely contested 1995 vote , said @entity115 , a political science professor at @entity116 in @entity2			0
the issue seemed to fade following that loss and the 2003 election of @entity74 as premier , and was not the central issue in the election that vaulted @entity10 to power , @entity115 said			1
" @entity124 played ( a role ) , but i would n't say it was the ballot box issue in this election , " @entity115 said			0
while @entity10 talked up the issue with the party faithful , she pitched to the broader electorate with a message of change and a platform calling for expanded economic programs and government financial reforms , @entity115 said			2
during her victory speech , @entity10 called for unity and told @entity65 - speaking @entity9 residents that their rights would be respected , @entity135 reported			1
