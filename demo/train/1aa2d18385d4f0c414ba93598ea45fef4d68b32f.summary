-- most success - hungry entrepreneurs would tell you there 's not enough hours in the day -- try saying that to @entity5			1
hailing from the impoverished slum of @entity9 on the western outskirts of @entity11 , the 23 - year - old 's daily tasks include running a delivery service company , owning a barbershop and selling energy efficient stoves -- all the while putting himself through university			1
@entity5 's typical day starts when everyone else is still deep in their sleep			1
by 3am , he 's already up , studying and preparing his school assignments for later in the evening ; by 7am , he enters the green doors of " @entity25 , " the barbershop he set up three years ago at the heart of his local community			1
by 8am , he leaves the shop to an employee to start running his @entity29 courier service -- jumping on his motorbike , @entity5 spends most of his day making personal deliveries all across the bustling @entity33 capital , whilst checking every now and then his @entity35 page for any orders for his latest business venture : selling @entity39 clean burning cook stoves			1
by 4.30pm , @entity41 parks his motorbike , only to head to the @entity42 where he is a first - year student of community development			2
lectures last from 5.30pm to 8.30pm and by 10pm he 's usually at bed -- only to wake up at 3am again the next day to do it all over again			0
exhausting , no ? " it 's a matter of determination and being focused , " explains the enterprising businessman			0
" it 's only the passion that i have to work in the community , " he adds , when asked how he juggles time to manage it all			0
risk - taker growing up in @entity9 , @entity5 became a multitasking entrepreneur out of necessity to pull himself out of poverty			1
one of the biggest challenges , he says , was feeling alone			0
" we youth in the slums are not supported , " says @entity5			2
" so you have to struggle with everything , " he continues			0
" you do n't have a mentor , you have no place to run for help -- that is what is making me work every day very hard			0

" determined to make it , he started " @entity25 " to earn money by shaving his clients and allowing them to charge their phones			0
then , about a year ago he got a driver 's license and launched @entity29			0
" the courier is different than the barbershop , " says @entity5 , who employs one staff member for each business			1
" because the barber i target the people i live around with and the courier i target people outside because they are busy , " he adds			0
" it 's people from the whole town , people who are much more richer , they do n't have time to do shopping or run for errands -- i took advantage of their busyness to make my business , so i deliver parcels , i deliver food , i deliver drinks			0
" ' i want to inspire ' thanks to his hard work and determination , @entity5 can now afford to pay for his own living space and also attend university			2
but the self - made entrepreneur wants to better the lives of people in his community too			1
on weekends , he spends most of his time with children in @entity9 , putting his community development skills into practice by mentoring young people and helping them put on theater performances			1
" after my studies i want to start a project to help people where i am living , " says the spirited entrepreneur			2
" to identify their needs , to realize their potential and help them achieve their goals , " he continues " my biggest dream in this world is to have a social business enterprise to help fight the poverty level -- i want to inspire young people like me			2
