there is a " night and day " difference between @entity5 on october 1 and the same site on december 1 , @entity0 , the top administration official responsible for improving the problem - plagued @entity2 enrollment site , said sunday on a conference call with reporters			1
deadline day : will @entity2 site work ? @entity0 and @entity11 , spokeswoman for the federal agency charged with developing and operating @entity5 , said the website now works " smoothly for the vast majority of users			1
" the administration said the site can now handle 50,000 concurrent users and 800,000 consumer visits a day -- two capacity goals for the portal that date back to its launch two months ago			2
and @entity11 said the site was now allowing " in the zone of 80 % " of users to successfully complete a health care enrollment			0
in short , after a concerted effort to improve @entity5 , the administration said sunday that the online @entity2 enrollment portal now essentially meets all of the previously stated goals for the website			2
obamacare site fix : 5 things to look for a day after the administration 's self - imposed deadline for improving the website , @entity0 detailed the turnaround efforts he 's been leading			2
work has fallen into three broad categories : creating a new management structure for the site to improve decision - making and accountability ; putting in place hardware upgrades to increase the system 's " redundancy , reliability , and scale " ; and compiling a prioritized " punch list " of bugs and software improvements -- 400 of which had been completed by sunday			1
prior to the turnaround effort , @entity0 said , management of the enrollment site had been plagued by slow decision - making and a lack of accountability			2
these issues were addressed by creating a new management structure led by general contractor @entity61 , which was tapped to oversee the site 's operations , and the creation of a 24 - hour , rapid response team that constantly monitors the site and the experience users are having on it			1
these management changes were intended , @entity0 said , to give the government - run website " the velocity and discipline of a high - performance private sector company			2
" upgrades , trouble - shooting , and old pizza on the hardware front , @entity0 said improvements have been made to the registration database , which plays a part in the front - end experience consumers have using the site ; new servers and upgraded memory have been added ; additional " application environments " are now online ; and the system 's firewall has been upgraded			1
these changes have made " the underlying infrastructure of @entity5 much stronger today , " @entity0 said , adding that some of the critical upgrades were completed as late as friday evening , when the site was down for 11 hours for maintenance as this weekend 's deadline approached			1
@entity0 likened the effect of the hardware upgrades to widening a highway 's on - ramp , effectively taking the site from two lanes to four			1
on the software front , @entity0 said 50 of the bug fixes completed during the turnaround effort had been done " just last night " during another period of maintenance			2
going forward , @entity0 anticipates there will still be other bugs and software fixes for the rapid response to handle			1
all these changes have made a noticeable difference in @entity5 's operating metrics , @entity0 said			1
the site 's average response time -- the average time it takes for the system to respond to an action by a user -- is down from eight seconds to under one second in the past three weeks , said @entity0			1
the site 's average error rate is also down , according to @entity0 , with the system hitting a rate of 0.75 % on friday			1
and the system 's " uptime , " a measure of system stability , is consistently surpassing 90 %			0
@entity0 said the creation of the rapid response team means necessary fixes can now usually be made within an hour instead of the hours it used to take			1
" we 've doubled the system 's capacity and the site can now handle its intended capacity , " explained @entity0 , summing up the net effect of the turnaround effort he has led			2
this means that two months after it originally launched , @entity5 can now handle 50,000 concurrent users and 800,000 consumer visits a day			0
if more than 50,000 people attempt to use the site at any one time , the site now has a queueing feature that will e-mail users with tips about when to return to the site at a less congested time and a link that will take them to the front of the line			0
" nothing like this ( was ) in place " in october , @entity0 said sunday			0
with all the recent improvements , administration officials conceded sunday that there is still work to be done			0
" as with any website , the team will continue to address bugs and glitches , " @entity0 said			0
in addition , work on the back end of the site , which is of critical importance to insurance companies issuing policies to consumers , still needs to be completed			1
the administration is still working with insurers on the " 834 " transaction forms generated by the system , said @entity11			0
" we 're working with issuers on a daily basis and will continue those conversations , " she said , adding that the site 's management team would have more information about this issue with the data generated by the system on upcoming weekdays			1
" there are still a number of problems with the back - end systems , " @entity184 , spokesman for health insurance industry trade association group @entity185 , said in a statement to @entity187			1
" insurers are still getting enrollment files that are duplicative and have missing or inaccurate information			0
in some cases they are not getting the enrollments at all			0
" insurers : site glitches persist as the administration 's self - imposed deadline for improving the troubled site has come and gone over the weekend , @entity198 on @entity199 have been unusually quiet , after months of frequent criticism of @entity5 and of broader changes to the health insurance market taking effect because of @entity2			1
website progress garners muted reaction from @entity209 @entity210 took issue sunday primarily with @entity2 's changes to the insurance market rather than with the enrollment site 's troubled history			1
@entity2 playbook : spread negative perception " this is n't just about a broken website , it 's about a fundamentally - flawed law , " @entity217 , spokesman for @entity219 speaker @entity218 , said in a statement			2
" whether or not @entity226 can logon to @entity5 , they are losing the health plans they like , the doctors they 've always relied on , and -- to add insult to injury -- facing higher costs as well			0
" a spokesman for @entity219 majority leader @entity233 had a similar message			0
" millions of @entity226 being informed that the health care plans they liked are being canceled -- despite the president 's repeated assurances otherwise -- and being forced to pay higher premiums , deductibles , or both , are a much greater priority than a broken website , " @entity233 deputy chief of staff @entity235 told @entity187			0
" besides , " added @entity235 , " based on past performance , it would be prudent to wait before determining that the website truly is fixed			0
" comments from @entity249 and @entity235 echoed those of sen. @entity251 , @entity252 , just a day earlier			0
@entity251 , who chairs the @entity253 , argued saturday that @entity226 will continue to face problems with @entity2 's reforms " ( r ) egardless of whether the website is fixed by the administration 's revised deadline			0
" " these are problems that no it specialist working through the @entity262 holiday can fix , " he added			0
@entity263 : people do think i 'm trustworthy @entity187 / @entity266 poll : are @entity2 's flaws fixable ? high court to hear @entity2 birth control case @entity218 signs up for @entity2 @entity187 / @entity266 poll : @entity263 's marks for management , trustworthiness take hit			0
