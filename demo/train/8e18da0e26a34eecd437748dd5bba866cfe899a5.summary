-- are one of sport 's most high - profile power couples back together ? or did they never part ? the sight of golf 's two - time major winner @entity5 and former world no. 1 tennis player @entity7 striding down the fairways in @entity9 certainly set a few tongues wagging			1
a mass of media reports had claimed the duo were no longer an item , both parties remaining tight lipped whenever they were quizzed about their relationship in recent weeks and months			1
but @entity7 followed the @entity18 for all 18 holes of his opening round at the @entity22 in @entity9 -- the climax of the @entity25 season			1
the @entity26 had tweeted a picture of @entity5 playing tennis the previous day as she begins her preparations for the new tennis season			2
despite her support @entity5 occasionally cut a frustrated figure out on the @entity36 course , carding an opening round of one - under - par , having been three under for his first four holes			1
@entity5 is five shots off the lead , held by @entity42 's @entity41 , with @entity43 -- who is aiming to be the first golfer to win the @entity48 's @entity47 series as well as the race to @entity9 -- on four - under			1
" it 's much better than it has been the last few months and i am playing better , which is important , " @entity5 told the official @entity25 website			1
" it 's good that the game is back on track			2
i have this event and two more so it would be great to get a win before the end of the season			2
" @entity62 's @entity43 carded a round of 68 -- his only bogey of the day coming after he missed a short putt on the final hole			1
if making history was n't enough motivation for @entity43 perhaps his bet with another potential winner -- @entity72 's @entity71 -- might be			1
some months ago @entity43 agreed to act as drinks waiter for the pair on a night out should @entity71 overhaul him and get the 345,000 points he needs to win the race to @entity9 title			1
at his pre-tournament press conference @entity43 told reporters : " that 's probably my biggest motivation , not to become his servant for a day			2
he is certainly not going off that bet and i know he is up my tail			0
" but @entity43 is well placed to fend off the challenge of @entity71 , as well as other potential winners , 2013 @entity89 champion @entity88 and @entity91 's @entity90 , who won the @entity89 in 2010			2
" it has been a lot of hard work all season and i just let my focus slip on the last , " @entity43 told the official @entity25 website of his solitary bogey			1
" that sucks , but i am still in good shape and playing nicely			0
the guys are running on fumes so everybody is looking forward to getting done			0
" you ca n't win a tournament on thursday but you can certainly play your way out of it			0
i would have taken four - under at the start of the day so i just have to let the disappointment of the last slip away			0
" @entity71 is only a shot further back but was frustrated he did n't make more of the opportunities he gave himself			0
" i am annoyed , " @entity71 said			0
" i made two putts which were outside birdie chances and took a couple more but the rest were missed			0
i am frustrated but happy to be only three behind			0
" i need to continue to be aggressive and see if i can nick it at the end			0
it 's a good mix to be really angry being three under par and still being in there for the next three days			0
