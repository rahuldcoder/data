-- seriously , do n't believe everything you read on the @entity3			2
intentionally or not , the latest round of misleading stories making viral waves has made it harder to tell truth from fiction			1
here 's a quick guide to some of the most viral fake stories this week : @entity14 fees no , @entity14 is not going to start charging you			1
@entity14 even created a help page just to say this : " @entity14 is a free site and will never require that you pay to continue using the site			1
" the page then goes on to explain that , yes , you may pay money for some games and other apps you play on the site			1
and if you go over your mobile phone 's data limit while using @entity14 , you 'll have to pay for that , too			1
that still too vague for you ? maybe leaves a little too much wiggle room ? well , then , let 's try this entry under @entity33			2
question : will @entity14 ever charge for service ? answers : no. we will always keep @entity14 a free service for everyone			1
when contacted , a @entity14 spokeswoman simply pointed to those two entries instead of providing a response			1
we 're guessing if someone had to answer this question for @entity14 every time it came up , it would be a full - time job			1
obamacare and @entity49 coverage there 's no reason to think your health insurance would treat a case of @entity49 any differently than it would any other illness because of @entity47			2
but a false viral story making the rounds may have some people convinced otherwise			1
and , for that , we can thank @entity60			0
that was where the most recent " pay for @entity14 " story originated , and it 's where this doozy comes from , too			1
@entity60 is a satire site , though it 's sometimes hard to tell if you just breeze through the headline and first few sentences of a story			1
we all know the @entity72 is fake news			2
( well , almost all of us , anyway )			0
but sites such as @entity60 and @entity75 are n't so well - known or , for that matter , nearly as funny			0
in fact , the more cynical among us may think these sites are intentionally trying to drive traffic by pushing out seemingly real stories about hot topics			2
you know ... like how a controversial government policy addresses an unprecedented and frightening , if isolated , disease outbreak			0
@entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 ... or none of the above ? if you like football and you hate @entity86 , well , welcome to 97 % of the population of the @entity91			1
( full disclosure : we made up that statistic			0
) but if you responded to the @entity85 's recent off - the - field troubles by sharing a post that shows that our lawmakers are bigger lawbreakers than our football stars , you fell for a fake			2
the good people at @entity102 , the @entity104 's bs meter since 1995 , are all over this one , as is @entity105			0
the so - called statistics -- 36 members of @entity86 have been accused of spousal abuse , three have been in jail for assault , 84 were arrested for drunk driving in a single year -- change from version to version			1
but these figures all go back to a 1999 online article that provided no source for its statistics and named none of the supposedly corrupt members of @entity86			1
under scrutiny , it was later retracted			0
sorry , @entity123 's still not a planet but some smart people say it should be			0
space geeks everywhere were saddened in 2006 when @entity123 lost its status as our solar system 's ninth planet			0
so you can forgive them , perhaps for jumping the gun on social media when news appeared to hit recently that the tiny , chilly chunk of rock has been restored to its rightful place			1
call this one a combination of enthusiasm , confusion and exaggeration			0
what actually happened was that the @entity146 held a september 18 debate on whether @entity123 should be restored to its full glory and four days later released the results of a vote by the audience			0
but in reporting that event , which has no official influence , many blogs and news sites appeared to go a bit too far , at least with their headlines			0
" the people have voted : @entity123 is a @entity159 ! " @entity160 blared			0
" @entity123 is a @entity162 , according to @entity163 , " another blog announced			0
so you can see how some of us who grew up with " @entity167 " rushed to the incorrect conclusion that we have " nine planets large and small " again			0
do n't microwave your @entity170 thanks , 4chan ! when @entity175 's @entity174 8 , the new operating system for mobile devices such as its new @entity170 and @entity178 , rolled out this month , some of the online message board 's notorious pranksters greeted it by crafting a fake ad for a new service			1
wave , according to what we have to admit was a pretty authentic looking ad done in @entity175 's trademark style , is a feature that " allows your device to be charged wirelessly through microwave frequencies			2
" just pop your phone in the microwave , and the battery will be all charged up			2
we 'd like to believe no one actually fell for this one			0
so , if you know otherwise , just do n't tell us .			0

here are five fake stories making the rounds on @entity14
the social media site has said repeatedly it will never charge users
@entity202 had fun with a fake @entity170 microwave app story
