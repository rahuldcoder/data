-- @entity2 's latest in - flight safety video , released tuesday , is already another viral hit but is encountering some turbulence over its use of several bikini - clad @entity7 models			1
view the video here previous versions of the video -- starring anything from @entity12 to @entity13 to @entity16 's all conquering @entity15 rugby team -- have revolutionized the on - board safety message airlines deliver to passengers			2
the most recent effort though is being criticized by some as neither ground - breaking nor as creative , after the airline teamed up with @entity7 magazine to produce what it 's calling " the world 's most beautiful safety video			2
" the " safety in @entity31 " video , which rolls out on @entity2 flights at the end of february , is beautifully shot and certainly cheerful and fun			1
it was filmed in the @entity33 -- home to several stunning beaches -- and coincides with the 50th anniversary of @entity7 's swimsuit franchise			0
earlier videos have been witty , clever and quirky but the paradise video combines a far less subtle use of eye - catching material -- using four of the planet 's most beautiful , and scantily clad women , to deliver information to passengers			0
the models include @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			1
" it seems that suddenly they are saying that my sexuality is all that matters about me , " one critic , @entity56 lecturer and feminist commentator @entity57 told the @entity58			0
social media reaction to the video was predictably mixed , though the majority of commenters on @entity66 and @entity67 appeared to support the video -- and the women in it			0
many praised @entity2 for using beautiful women to promote the @entity33 and complimented the airline on its marketing prowess , given the mass of media attention now being given to the safety video			1
from the negative corner , while some commented they were appalled @entity2 would be so sexist , others said the @entity7 version just is n't all that clever -- a disappointing follow up to the airline 's creative safety videos of the past			1
" no no no no no ! what a giant step backwards for the representation of women by @entity2 , " commented @entity66 user @entity84 on @entity2 's official page			1
" i am so embarrassed and disappointed , as a young @entity16 woman who travels for business and leisure with @entity2			1
this is n't the beauty of the @entity33			0
the beauty of the @entity33 is the scenery and its ( truly ) beautiful inhabitants			0
i 'm actually a little disgusted			0
" ( we 've posted several comments from social media at the base of this story ) @entity2 spokesperson @entity101 refuted those comments			2
" we have been careful to ensure ' @entity102 in @entity31 ' has been produced in a way that is tasteful , " he said			2
the carrier , taking fun seriously , quickly established a reputation for edgy safety videos -- part of the company strategy , @entity2 ceo @entity104 told @entity0			1
" we know that we actually get our customers watching and interpreting and internalizing our safety messages , better than i would argue anyone else , because we get their attention with the video ... we 've had 12 million people watch our @entity12 safety video on @entity119 and you sit there and go , that 's quite an incredible thing			1
but it 's another small example of just how we think that we can deliver the table stakes of a great airline but actually do it with a twist and with some personality along the way , " @entity104 told @entity0 in an interview recorded late january for @entity0 's business feature series , executive innovator			0
that interview was conducted before the safety video was released			2
" we 'll have inflight safety videos that people love or people hate			2
but at the end of the day it 's about taking risk and embracing risk intelligently			0
and that 's what we 've trying to do across the whole of the business as a result			0
" previous safety video " episodes " include " @entity148 , " featuring @entity149 and other octogenarians , " @entity151 , " with @entity13 and " @entity152 with @entity153 , " in which a sequin - shirted , short - shorted @entity153 gaily encourages passengers to " grab , click and pull ! " the latter has racked up nearly 3 million views on @entity119			1
the latest " safety in @entity31 : video includes : - @entity48 checking herself in a mirror having donned her oxygen mask			1
- local men sneaking a look at a pouting , frolicking @entity51 while demonstrating how to " brace			2
" - a three - second glimpse of a muscly male pool cleaner ( seemingly in case the ladies were feeling neglected )			0
the " making of " video already has 540,000 views on @entity119 , while the " @entity102 " video , released tuesday , has more than 120,000 at the time of writing			1
below are some of the reactions sourced from social media			0
