-- in the movies , it 's a familiar storyline : superheroes joining forces to tackle a world crisis			0
but @entity6 can do it , too			1
@entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 are working together to help @entity12 orphans in the @entity14 nation of @entity15			1
in 2002 , @entity16 started the @entity17 in @entity15 , where half a million children have been orphaned by @entity12			1
for her efforts , she was honored as a top 10 @entity6 in 2008			1
today , there are 400 children in the school , and they 're also benefiting from the help of two top 10 heroes from 2010 : @entity9 , whose organization , @entity9 , feeds more than 600,000 schoolchildren around the globe ; and @entity10 , who has brought more than 23,000 free solar lanterns to rural @entity14 communities through his nonprofit , @entity32			1
@entity0 recently spoke with @entity16 about the team - up and how it 's helping the children			1
@entity0 : how did you connect with @entity36 ? @entity8 : i went to the @entity6 tribute show in 2010 , and i saw @entity36 because he was one of the top 10 @entity6			1
in his speech , he mentioned ... how he was feeding over 300,000 children in @entity15			1
so , after he got his award , i had to go and see him and say thank you			0
but there was something else that was happening at our school at that same time			2
for all the years that i had the school , i was buying the porridge for the children , costing me something like $ 500 a month			1
then , for a time , we were given porridge by ( another organization ) ... but we had had a drought in @entity15 , so i was panicking			1
i went up to @entity36 and ... i told him what was going on at the school			2
i felt a little embarrassed , but i just asked him to consider us			0
now , he 's feeding all 400 of our students a day			2
some of these children do go without food at home , and most of them come without breakfast to school			1
this porridge has all the nutrients needed and is made of soya , too -- one of the healthiest meals our orphans can have each day			2
we have many students who are @entity73 - positive , so @entity9 is saving lives by keeping our children healthy			1
@entity0 : how has @entity36 ' support enabled you to do more for your students ? @entity16 : the high school students who stayed in school through the afternoon ... they were weak , most sleeping in class			1
( @entity9 ) agreed to provide an additional meal of porridge for ( them ) at noon			2
this has resulted in a lot more attendance at the school and students studying with energy			2
one of our college graduates is now working for @entity9 as a field monitor			1
... this is what we want : to see them graduate and get quality jobs			0
@entity9 built a new stove for us that uses less firewood and cooks our porridge even faster			2
... now , the most firewood we will use is about seven pieces , down from 40 pieces			0
so we 've actually saved our costs			0
and the most important thing is , we 're saving the environment			0
@entity36 , he 's really a saint to me			0
his support means a lot to us			0
every day , the children will always have something to eat , so we are thankful			0
do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2012 @entity6 @entity0 : how did you come to work with @entity10 ? @entity16 : i first heard about @entity10 through @entity6			1
i met him through a friend of mine , @entity119 , who thought @entity10 should come to teach our kids to build the ( solar lanterns )			1
then @entity124 , a math teacher at the @entity125 in @entity126 -- one of our biggest supporters -- was looking for another project for his students to become involved in			0
... since seeing my story on tv , they 've visited us and donated money to build our first toilets with running water , a clinic and a physics and science lab. ... so , ( he ) raised money to bring this project to life			0
today , i 'm happy to tell you that we have over 200 lamps made by the kids themselves with the help of @entity10 and his team , and we distributed the lamps to the kids who are taking their examinations			2
for the family , ( this ) cuts the costs			0
and for the children , it 's helping them to study			1
and during this examination time ... i 'm sure we 're going to see better results , so we 're very thankful to @entity10			2
@entity0 : how did your students respond to him ? @entity16 : @entity10 brought a lot more than just those lamps to our students			1
... he 's a young @entity14 guy , and they 're young @entity14 students , so ... he 's motivated our kids to be inventors			0
they 've come up with their own little models that work just like @entity10 ' lamps			2
... he really gave them confidence that they , too , can make something that can help people and change people 's lives			0
this summer , the kids will be making their own designs and ( giving ) a lamp and a book out in the villages and to schools			0
this will be our first outreach program ... teaching our kids to give back			0
@entity0 : are you surprised that two of your fellow honorees have been able to help you ? @entity16 : @entity6 coming together to work together is something that i do n't see as that unusual			1
all of us ( are ) doing something that is helping others , so when we hear each other 's stories , we just want to see if we can help			0
it 's a family , you know ? you want to help your family			0
i love it , and it makes a huge difference .			0
