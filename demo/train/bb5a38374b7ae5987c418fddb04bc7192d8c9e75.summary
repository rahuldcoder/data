@entity0 , @entity1 -- football will pay its tribute to the legend of @entity6 's @entity5 on wednesday in moments of remembrance on the 50th anniversary of the @entity11 air disaster			1
a memorial stone recalls the place of the @entity11 air disaster in @entity14 near @entity11			1
eight players lost their lives on february 6 , 1958 , when @entity18 @entity17 crashed on the third attempt to take off after re-fuelling in @entity20 as @entity6 returned from knocking @entity21 out of the @entity22			1
sir @entity24 's side , back - to - back @entity1 champions and well positioned for a hat - trick attempt , were arguably on course to become the best @entity6 team			1
the @entity6 players killed at @entity11 were @entity29 , aged 25 , @entity30 ( 28 ) , @entity31 ( 21 ) , @entity32 ( 24 ) , @entity33 ( 22 ) , @entity34 ( 26 ) , @entity35 ( 22 ) and 21 - year - old @entity36 who died in hospital 15 days after the crash			1

in keeping with tradition , @entity6 supporters will also gather under the memorial plaque at @entity41 where the clock is fixed at the exact time of the final fateful take - off attempt			2
later in the day , a minute 's silence will take place ahead of @entity1 's friendly with @entity54 at @entity55 as a further mark of respect			0
as he bows his head during this week 's @entity11 commemorations , survivor @entity59 's mind will understandably flash back to that snow - laden runway , but only briefly			2
the 75 - year - old @entity64 prefers not to remember the afternoon he lost so many friends among the victims , but instead the days when the dream of the ' @entity5 ' was still vibrant and alive			0
goalkeeper @entity59 , hailed a hero in the wake of the crash after returning to the wreckage to pull out survivors , is adamant those are the times which always burn brightest in his memory			0
" i was part of something that was a very , very beautiful thing at that time , " said @entity59 , who cost @entity6 a record 23,000 pounds sterling when he joined from @entity75 two months before the disaster			2
" i 'll always be proud of that			0
the fact there 's going to be a minute 's silence after 50 years is a tribute to the people i played with , but one must remember as well there were other people on board that aircraft , a lot more people			0
" i want the minute 's silence to be over and then i want to remember the happy times , that 's what i want the world to remember , that 's what i want the families to remember			0
