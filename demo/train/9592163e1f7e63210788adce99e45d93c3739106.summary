-- president @entity1 will find that much has changed in @entity2 when he arrives on may 2			1
our neighbor to the @entity5 -- and second - largest export market -- has moved far ahead with reforms			0
as @entity10 crafts comprehensive immigration legislation , @entity8 and @entity9 must keep in mind that @entity2 is changing rapidly , and policies crafted to reflect yesterday 's @entity2 will not help the @entity14 make the most of the potential of today 's and tomorrow 's @entity2			1
@entity2 's future is bright , and tapping into this growth and economic prosperity is vital to @entity14 competitiveness			1
but the @entity14 needs immigration reform to build on its huge bilateral trade with @entity2 -- more than $ 1 billion in goods and services each day , or $ 45 million an hour			1
@entity2 's president @entity25 ± a @entity26 has achieved in less than five months in office what eluded previous administrations for six years			1
in the second half of 2013 , he hopes to add energy to the improvements in education and telecommunications that are sailing through under the umbrella of the @entity37 political agreement			0
demographic and economic transformations in @entity2 mean that the @entity14 can expect the number of @entity2 coming into the @entity14 to slow to a trickle			2
@entity2 make up about 58 % of the 11 million in the @entity14 without authorization			2
the @entity42 reports zero net migration from 2005 to 2010 , with about 1.4 million @entity2 both entering and leaving the @entity14			2
@entity42 demographers even raise the possibility that the return flow may be exceeding the number of @entity2 coming north			2
the reasons for the drop in @entity2 migration are a combination of changes in the " push " and " pull " factors that determine migratory patterns			2
the decline in the " pull " factor is all too well - known -- it 's no longer so desirable to migrate to the @entity14 for jobs			0
but @entity2 's rise also means that going north is a less attractive option for getting ahead in life			1
its economy grew at more than double the rate of the @entity14 last year , with a projected 3.5 % growth in 2013			0
between 2005 and 2008 , as noted in @entity67 and @entity68 " get the facts " series , the number of new @entity2 businesses created each year increased by 27 % , which is 2.5 times the @entity73 average			0
over the same period , the number of students in @entity2 graduating from advanced university level programs increased by 11 %			0
if the february education reform , aimed at improving standards to boost the overall quality of education , is successful , more young @entity2 will have the training to compete in the 21st century workforce			1
in the past decade , the @entity2 middle class grew by 17 % , and in just two generations , the fertility rate dropped nearly 70 % -- signaling the end of the youth bulge that contributed to the " push " to the @entity14			0
@entity2 is a hub of business activity			0
despite the insecurity in certain parts of the country , @entity2 entrepreneurs and foreign companies are setting up shop			0
@entity98 is fast - becoming @entity2 's @entity99 with tech entrepreneurs from across @entity2 flocking to the capital of @entity103 state			1
at the same time , as wages rise in @entity106 , firms are relocating their manufacturing options to @entity2 , where wages remain competitive and where products have easier access to the @entity14 and @entity112 markets through the @entity113			1
@entity115 immigration reform will open a gateway to one of @entity119 's fastest - growing economies			1
by providing a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented immigrants of @entity2 origin , reform will make it easier for laborers to cross borders , which will harness the competitiveness of both countries			1
it would also show that the @entity14 is a true economic partner with @entity2 and the rest of the @entity133			0
legal status would open the door for these immigrants and their children to further increase their contributions to the @entity14 economy and to start small businesses that would capitalize on their cross-border networks			0
this is a highly likely scenario as immigrants are more likely to start a business than those born in the @entity14 , and @entity2 represent the greatest number of foreign - born small - business owners			1
at the same time , greater emphasis on a demand - driven visa system would create new ways for workers to enter the @entity14 who will be increasingly needed as baby boomers retire			0
also critical for increasing cross-border trade is improving efficiency at the border			1
any new border security plan should improve infrastructure and technology to reduce the congestion that delays trade			0
improved trade means more @entity14 jobs , with 6 million , or 1 in 24 jobs , across 22 states attributed to bilateral commerce			0
undocumented immigration will keep declining as more @entity2 find new opportunities at home			2
that means the big question for @entity10 to consider should be how to ensure that our immigration system helps @entity176 competitiveness and prosperity , and how the @entity14 can attract the workers -- including @entity2 -- it will need .			2

@entity180 : @entity1 will see a @entity2 on the rise economically when he visits
@entity180 : immigration *law* needs to *address* the @entity2 of today and tomorrow
immigration reform will open up one of @entity119 's fastest - growing economies , he says
also critical for increasing cross-border trade is improving efficiency at the border , he says
