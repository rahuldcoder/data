-- humans have a strange relationship with food			1
this seems to be a global truth that is perhaps best evidenced by the array of unusual food festivals the world over			1
we do n't merely celebrate food , we wrestle in it , wage war with it , idolize it , and , in @entity11 , @entity12 , race it down a steep hill			1
no matter what your favorite food is , chances are somewhere , large gatherings of aficionados have found some outlandish way to commemorate it			1
even @entity21 has found a place of honor			1
" @entity27 is one of the biggest consumers of @entity21 in the world , " explains @entity24 , an organizer of the annual @entity25 , which last year had 25,000 visitors			1
@entity31 sells more product in @entity27 per person than in any other @entity35 state			1
according to the @entity25 website , almost seven million cans of the stuff are eaten in @entity27 every year			1
the festival 's dozen or so vendors demonstrate the meat - product 's unexpected versatility			1
" this year , we had @entity21 cheesecake and @entity21 ice cream			1
in the past , we 've had @entity21 ravioli , @entity47 , @entity46 , spam @entity49 fries -- pretty much everything can be made with @entity21 , " says @entity24			1
@entity31 represented at festivals can range from the more mundane -- melons , pumpkins , potatoes -- to the downright daring			2
in @entity57 , locals are keen to celebrate a local delicacy -- road kill			0
last week saw the kick off of @entity61 , @entity63 's @entity62 , a celebration of @entity65 , aka bull testicles			1
next month , adventurous eaters can sample scorpions at @entity68 in @entity69			0
however , there are times when imbibing our favorite foods is not enough			0
sometimes , it seems , making a mess is the only way to do it justice			0
several festivals demand participants get dirty			2
@entity80 -- where thousands travel to @entity82 to engage in a bustling tomato fight -- is perhaps the most famous of these , though there are many instances in which festival - goers feel the need to rollick around in grub			0
on august 23 , @entity89 , @entity90 , will celebrate @entity91 , an annual two - day festival dedicated to the humble tuber			1
no matter how many activities the organizers introduce , however , the most popular remains the mashed potato wrestling competition			2
" it 's quite a sight to watch people wrestling around in mashed potatoes , " admits @entity96 , the festival 's executive director			1
" afterward , they find mashed potato everywhere			0
" the festival started in 1951 as a source of post-harvest entertainment			0
back then , the activities were limited to a potato picking contest for the men , and a peeling competition for the women			0
since then , it 's matured , and events include a cook - off , a mashed potato sculpting contest and a potato sack fashion show			2

in some instances , culinary celebrations act as a historic link			2
in @entity127 , @entity49 , the townspeople make a giant omelet every @entity128 to feed the poor , a tradition that supposedly started when @entity131 and his army stopped in the town for the night			0
legend has it that @entity136 ordered the villagers to gather all their eggs to make an omelet for his army			0
the celebration has since spread to @entity49 - speaking communities across the globe			0
in @entity145 , @entity146 , the town launched their own version of the tradition ( albeit with a @entity151 twist )			0
" it 's grown to seven cities throughout the world , and we each add a local ingredient , " says @entity152 , the third @entity153 of @entity145 's @entity154			2
the town uses 5,000 eggs , and adds @entity161 and crayfish to make it their own			0
while there are many who would argue that food is art , some regions take this line of thinking to a new level			2
at the @entity173 in @entity174 , for instance , locals create elaborate floats using 40 tons of hallowed out turnips			1
in the past , they 've created replicas of panthers , windmills , ships , whales -- even @entity182			0
though the tiny town of @entity185 houses a meager 12,000 residents , the festival attracts 20,000 visitors each year			0
" we 're a small village , so you can imagine how crowded it gets , " says @entity188 , a spokeswoman for @entity189			1
@entity188 describes the atmosphere as warm and peaceful			0
just do n't eat the turnips , she warns			2
" it 's not good for your stomach , " she says			0
" it 's like eating too much beans			0
