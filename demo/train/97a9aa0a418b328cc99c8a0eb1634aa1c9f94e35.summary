@entity0 , @entity1 -- the call came over the radio			2
" and then , even worse : " officer down			1

he jumped into his suv and tore down the road			2
a dozen or so blocks away , at the @entity14 , a gunman had opened fire on soldiers			1
@entity7 stepped from his truck			1
his department 's motto is " protecting those who protect us			2
" he hoped he was not too late for that			2
wounded and dead soldiers were everywhere			2
" i was listening to people hollering for help , and i was trying to get in there to see what we had , " @entity7 recalled three days after the november 5 attack			1
" i assumed that we would have maybe several victims			2
i had no idea , i just could not fathom what we were going to encounter			1
" amid all the army uniforms , one dark blue uniform stuck out			2
it was @entity0 police sgt. @entity37 , who , officials say , shot the alleged gunman , maj. @entity42 , to end the rampage			0
she suffered three gunshot wounds			0
" i broke and ran over to her , " @entity7 said			1

" @entity7 and @entity49 had worked closely in the past			1
he considers her a friend			0
@entity54 medics had fashioned a makeshift tourniquet on her leg			0

@entity7 , who began as a volunteer firefighter 26 years ago when he was just a teen , took over the scene as incident commander			1
but first , he paused for a quick prayer			0
" i just asked the lord to be with me , to give me the strength and the courage i need to do my job wisely and keep my people safe			1
" even as the first responders worked on the dozens of wounded soldiers , they were n't certain whether there were other shooters on the post			0
" the thought 's always there on your mind that there could be another suspect in the area , " @entity7 said			1
as for @entity42 , the fire chief says that discussing the shooting suspect is too emotional			1

" @entity106 ' prayers remain with the soldiers he tries to keep safe			0
