-- on this week 's @entity6 podcast , writers @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 discuss @entity8 's recent announcement of a new privacy policy -- and the concerns some folks have voiced about it			1
the policy spells out the fact that @entity8 is assembling users ' activity on all of its products -- from search to @entity18 to phones running its @entity21 system on smartphones			2
@entity8 says it 's to enhance user experience ( and better target ads ) but some critics fear having all of that activity rounded up in one place			1
we also talk about a pretty stunning number concerning tablets and e-readers			1
both types of devices are at least a couple of years old			0
but , according to a new survey , the number of people who own them in the @entity38 nearly doubled during just a few weeks in november and december			2
does this mean tablets and e-readers have reached a major tipping point ? our @entity43 come from a story about @entity45			2
the site said this week that the feature will no longer be optional			0
and our @entity48 goes to a politician who flung around some statistics about @entity51 and @entity52 this week			1
if only he 'd thought to find out if they are actually true			0
