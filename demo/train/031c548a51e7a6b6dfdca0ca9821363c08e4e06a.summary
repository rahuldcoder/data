-- information about a keyboard being included in the " @entity4 " package was teased in the " @entity5 : @entity7 " demo			2
we have now been given some exclusive information by our now - famous mole about what we can expect from " @entity4			2
" read on to find out what to expect from the instruments in the latest version of the game			1
it 's the ' 80s ! there wo n't actually be a keyboard peripheral sold with the game ; instead there will be a keytar - like instrument supported			1
for those who did n't listen to much ' 80s music , a keytar is a sort of keyboard with a strap , held like a guitar			1
the keytar will be the only new instrument for the game			1
we were surprised that new instruments were being released at all , since @entity33 had noted that they were focusing on software and not hardware in order to cut costs			2
we figured @entity38 would follow what seemed to be a savvy strategy in a world already choked with peripherals			0
@entity38 will actually be doing something similar , and the peripherals will be created by an outside company			0
@entity45 is bringing the instruments @entity45 will be creating all the " @entity4 " instruments and bundles ; @entity49 will only be distributing the software			1
@entity45 will be offering many different bundles with different combinations of instruments available , and there will be bundles that are exclusive to certain retailers			1
if you have guitars , you 'll be able to find a bundle for drums			0
if you need everything , that will be available as well			0
if a store does n't want to be saddled with huge boxes , they can simply stock the game			2
this will allow the focus of the launch to be kept on the software , and we 're told that there will be a " pro " mode included in the game that will require proper technique , and may lead to actual skills on guitars and bass			0
how this will work is n't known , but it 's possible @entity45 may create a product that more closely mimics an actual guitar			1
all this information is firmly in the rumor pile , excluding the @entity45 connection , but our @entity85 has successfully broken more stories in gaming news and peripherals than anyone else in this business , so we 're confident in this data			1
it also makes sense : @entity45 has long had the license to release @entity7 peripherals , and large bundles suffer from thin margins and can be expensive to stock			0
giving control of the hardware to a company who knows how to release and ship peripherals makes sense for everyone , and more bundles give retailers a new layer of granularity to stock items based on their needs			0
as for the keytar ? we have no clue			0
expect this information to be confirmed at @entity115			0

@entity0 's " @entity85 " *reports* that a keytar - like instrument will be supported
the keyboard / guitar combination will be the only new instrument
instruments and game will be available in several bundles
