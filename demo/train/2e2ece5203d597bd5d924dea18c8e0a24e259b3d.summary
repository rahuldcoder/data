@entity0 -- the " nuclear option " would be the changing of @entity4 rules to enable judicial and executive nominees to be confirmed with just 51 votes instead of 60			1
apparently you need 60 votes to do just about anything in the @entity4 but change the rules			1
that only takes 51 votes			2
nuclear ? that sounds harsh for something as simple as a rule change			0
senators view themselves as being part of the " world 's greatest deliberative body			2
" it 's a debatable point , but in order to protect the minority party and make sure nobody does anything without a full debate , @entity4 rules require that 60 of 100 senators agree to votes to move toward confirming a nominee or passing legislation			1
in the fancy language they speak on @entity33 , moving toward a vote is called " invoking cloture			0
" @entity4 moving toward ' going nuclear ' actually confirming the nominee or passing the legislation takes only 50 votes , but because of the procedural rules , it pretty much takes 60 to invoke cloture and get anything done these days			1
by requiring only 51 votes , the entire character of the chamber would change			2
instead of being forced to get buy - in from the minority party ( republicans right now ) , the majority party ( @entity50 right now ) would be able to confirm anybody for whom they could get a simple majority			0
click here for a good academic paper from @entity56 at the @entity57 on " the rise of the 60 - @entity4 " the idea is that it would " blow up " the @entity4			1
we 're speaking figuratively , of course			0
the symbolism of " going nuclear " also portends a sort of mutually assured destruction in the future , to borrow another @entity68 term			0
democrats wo n't always control the @entity4			1
and when republicans are in charge , you can bet they 'll return the favor			0
man who coined the term ' nuclear option ' regrets ever pursuing it wow			0
is this constitutional ? @entity79 is			0
the @entity80 does n't say anything about @entity4 rules			1
it puts that power in the hands of senators and congressmen			0
" each @entity88 may determine the @entity89 of its proceedings , " according to @entity91			0
senators are tasked with signing off on nominees in @entity94 , section 2			0
but it does n't say how exactly , which has led to a centuries - long debate on the matter			2
here 's what the @entity80 says about the president 's power to appoint : " he shall have power ... with the @entity106 of the @entity4 , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and @entity109 , judges of the @entity111 , and all other officers of the @entity113 , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law : but the @entity116 may by @entity117 vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the president alone , in the @entity121 , or in the @entity122			1
there 's nothing in the @entity80			2
but @entity4 rules are pretty clear on the 60 - vote threshold			1
read the chapter on cloture			0
but they 've changed over time			0
until 1949 , for instance , according to the @entity132 , senators could n't even move to limit debate ( invoke cloture ) on nominations			1
according to the @entity4 website , @entity137 was the first senator to threaten going nuclear , back in 1841 , on legislation			1
up until 1975 , it actually took 67 votes to overcome a filibuster			1
the most famous examples came during the @entity145 when @entity146 from both parties blocked equal rights legislation			2
it took 60 days of filibustering to find the votes for the 1964 @entity151			1
what role does filibustering play in all this ? everybody seems to have a different definition of what a filibuster is			2
in pop culture , filibustering brings to mind @entity161 in " @entity163 , " speaking for hours to block legislation with which he disagrees			2
anymore the filibuster is an implied thing			2
when everybody realizes that if there are n't 60 votes to limit debate , senators do n't generally spend much time debating at all			1
even when a senator mounts a long , all - night speech , the outcome is usually pre-ordained			2
take sen. @entity177 , the @entity179 @entity178 who spoke all night just before the recent government shutdown			1
even before @entity177 started speaking , senators had reached agreement to vote on a government funding bill the next day			1
his speech was not a filibuster ; it was preaching to his political choir			1
why is all this coming to a head now ? this is where it gets even more complicated			0
republicans have been blocking nominees to the @entity194 not because they dislike all the nominees , but because they do n't want more democrats than @entity178 on that court			1
currently , there are equal numbers of @entity50 and @entity178 appointed judges on the court , which is considered second only to the @entity111 in importance			0
in fact , @entity178 want to shrink the number of judges on the court and expand the number of judges in other courts			0
but this is a fight that extends way beyond the current spat over the @entity211			1
the number of filibusters has exploded in recent years , and so has the number of votes trying to end them			0
between 1949 and 2012 , cloture was invoked 122 times			0
the vast majority of those occurred in the past decade			0
democrats , who employed the tactic of filibustering to some effect during the @entity226 administration , now say they 're fed up with republicans employing it against president @entity229			0
read a really detailed look at the history of filibusters and cloture filings from the @entity132			0
@entity178 block nominees to @entity0 court			1

@entity4 rules require 60 votes to move toward confirming a nominee or passing legislation
up until 1975 , it took 67 votes to overcome a filibuster
sen. @entity177 's floor speech before the government shutdown was n't a filibuster
current fight is over @entity0 court , but impact extends well beyond that
