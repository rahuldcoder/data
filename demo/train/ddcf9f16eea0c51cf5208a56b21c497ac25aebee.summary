-- in his native @entity2 , @entity1 is being counted on to lead the @entity4 nation to @entity6 glory on home soil next year			1
if he can score the kind of goal he did saturday in the @entity11 opener , then @entity2 's chances of claiming a record - extending sixth title will surely increase			1
@entity1 , hailed as the " modern successor " to @entity15 , netted with a stunning half volley in the third minute to help @entity2 beat @entity17 3 - 0 in @entity18 @entity19 and @entity20 added the other goals in the second half			1
" it all happened in a flash , " @entity1 said			2
" i connected full on and happily the ball found the target			0
i am very happy to score and help @entity2 to achieve a victory			2
" @entity29 fans probably were n't the only ones celebrating after @entity1 's strike			1
@entity33 supporters must have been pleased , too , since the 21 - year - old will team up with four - time world player of the year @entity35 at the @entity37 next season			0
the win , @entity2 's second straight after a 3 - 0 victory against @entity40 this week in a friendly , might lift some of the gloom surrounding the national team			1
even after topping @entity40 , @entity2 had won just two of its past seven matches and manager @entity46 was being criticized for his less than free flowing style of play			0
@entity1 was n't immune to criticism , either			0
" what mattered most was the result and this continued the tactical evolution of the team , " @entity46 said			0
with all eyes on @entity2 to see how the nation hosts the @entity6 dress rehearsal , the build - up to the game , though , was marred by protests across the country			1
thousands took to the streets to protest against an increase in public transportation costs and there was frustration about the lack of investment in health and education			1
in @entity74 a road leading to the stadium this week was reportedly blocked by hundreds of people who were unhappy with the costs of staging the @entity11 and @entity6 , and protests continued outside the stadium saturday			2
preparations for the 2014 showpiece itself have n't been smooth			0
work to stadiums fell behind schedule and last month managers of the stadium in @entity87 said human error was partly to blame for causing a tear in the roof			0
on the eve of the @entity11 , @entity92 president @entity91 -- booed when introduced before the game -- downplayed concerns			0
on the field , @entity2 had little trouble with @entity99 champion @entity17			2
@entity17 became the first nation to qualify for the @entity6 but its defeat saturday followed a 4 - 0 loss to @entity2 in a friendly in october			1
even @entity1 's harsher critics would have been silenced after his opener			1
@entity106 struck a diagonal ball to @entity108 , who chested it down for his strike partner yards outside the box			0
@entity1 pounced and left @entity113 goalkeeper @entity112 with no chance			0
@entity115 , a key performer in @entity17 's qualifying campaign , made a good run into the box in the ninth minute but his shot from the left side sailed over the bar			2
@entity112 denied @entity108 after good link up play with @entity1 before @entity19 realistically settled the game in the 48th minute			2
@entity112 got a hand to his low shot but not enough of it to keep it out of the net			0
@entity17 almost replied straight away but @entity130 was off target when supplied with a good cross from @entity133			0
@entity1 gave way to @entity135 in the 74th minute because of a slight injury and @entity2 made it three when @entity20 slotted home from @entity139 's pass in injury time			1
on sunday , world and @entity144 champion @entity141 plays @entity145 in @entity146 and @entity147 faces @entity148 in @entity18			1

@entity1 's half - volley gave @entity2 the early lead against @entity17 in the @entity11
@entity19 and @entity20 scored in the second half to complete the 3 - 0 win in @entity18
the win came amid protests across @entity2 about a hike public transportation costs
@entity141 plays @entity145 and @entity147 faces @entity148 as the *tournament* continues sunday
