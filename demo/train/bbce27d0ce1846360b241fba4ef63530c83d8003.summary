" do the @entity1 and @entity2 parties do an adequate job of representing the @entity5 people , or do they do such a poor job that a third major party is required ? " a record 60 % of @entity5 now yearn for a third major party , according to @entity9			1
independents , unsurprisingly , are most likely to favor a third party , but a majority of self - described republicans say yes , too			1
but what do they mean by that " yes " ? obviously , they mean many different things			0
some yearn for a third party representing the @entity19 center : fiscally conservative and socially liberal like the @entity21 mayor			2
but here 's a caution about third parties in @entity5 history : they are much more likely to arise on the fringes of the political system , not the center			1
@entity5 has seen third - party efforts by socialists and segregationists ; by right - to - lifers and libertarians			1
this is why you now hear so much " third party " talk coming from tea party @entity1 rather than ( as you might expect ) the party 's subordinated pragmatists			1
the sensible center is much more likely to exert itself inside existing parties , as @entity45 did for @entity1 in the 1950s and as @entity46 did for the @entity2 in the 1990s			1
pragmatists want to change the @entity1 so that it can win elections and govern effectively			1
tea party @entity1 prefer to express their principles regardless of consequences , which is why the @entity52 survey in september found that 71 % of them favored a government shutdown even though nearly 40 % of them expected that shutdown to have a " major " impact on the economy			1
third - party threats frighten @entity1 leaders			1
they remember that @entity62 's independent challenge badly hurt @entity64 's re-election campaign in 1992			0
@entity66 conservatives were locked out of power for nearly 15 years by a party split in the 1990s			2
@entity70 conservatives fear that a rise in support for the @entity73 could drain support from @entity70 's conservative - liberal governing coalition			0
yet politics is a complicated business , and it 's not always true that a party is weakened by the departure of its most extreme supporters			1
consider , for example , the case of the @entity2 in the election of 1948			0
that year , the @entity2 faced two groups that bolted			0
to protest president @entity87 's turn to support civil rights , southern @entity2 coalesced as a " @entity90 " party and nominated @entity92 gov. @entity91 for president			2
left - liberal @entity2 angered by @entity87 's tough @entity95 foreign policy created an " @entity97 " party and nominated former vice president @entity98			2
together , @entity91 and @entity98 took almost 5 % of the vote in 1948			2
@entity91 carried four @entity101 states and 7 % of the @entity102			2
in fact , there 's a reasonable argument that @entity87 was actually helped by these third - and fourth - party challenges			2
in 1948 , @entity107 - @entity5 remained very much a swing constituency			1
hundreds of thousands of black @entity5 had moved north and gained voting rights in the 30 years between 1917 and 1948			1
as a group , they tended to prefer the @entity113 policies of the @entity2 , but they deeply distrusted that party 's @entity115 white supremacist wing			2
@entity87 was a card - carrying member of the @entity117 who had adopted the civil rights cause late in his career			0
could he really be trusted ? @entity87 's willingness to face down @entity91 convinced many @entity123 blacks that he could be			0
he carried an estimated 77 % of the black vote in the @entity126 , and those votes provided the margin of victory in the three crucial states of @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133			0
those three states provided 73 electoral votes in total , and they were each won by @entity87 with a margin of less than 1 %			0
meanwhile , the @entity98 challenge helped @entity87 with more conservative voters			0
@entity87 had initiated the @entity140 and the @entity141 , yet some questioned whether the @entity2 were tough enough on communism -- an important question among voters of eastern @entity147 origin in states like @entity149 and @entity150			0
with @entity98 vehemently denouncing @entity87 as too tough on the @entity151 -- sometimes in speeches that echoed the editorials of the newspaper of the @entity155 -- @entity87 gained the same kind of political cover on his right flank that @entity91 had provided him on his left			0
the result , everybody knows			0
right now , tea party extremism contaminates the whole @entity1 brand			1
it 's a very interesting question whether a tea party bolt from the @entity1 might not just liberate the party to slide back to the political center -- and liberate @entity1 from identification with the @entity170 and the @entity171 who have done so much harm to their hopes over the past three election cycles			1
it 's worth repeating over and over again			0
add @entity177 in @entity178 and @entity179 in @entity180 , @entity181 in @entity182 and @entity183 in @entity184 , @entity185 in @entity186 and @entity187 in @entity188 -- and you have half a dozen @entity191 races lost to the @entity1 by extremist nominations			1
maybe the right answer to the threat , " shut down the government or we quit " is : " so sad you feel that way			0
do n't let the door hit you on the way out			0

@entity202 : @entity204 extremism contaminates the @entity1 brand
he cites a @entity9 poll saying that 60 % of @entity5 favor creation of a third party
most of the time , third parties are formed by the extreme wings of the parties , he says
@entity217 : if the tea party bolts the @entity1 , it would be a positive sign for republicans
