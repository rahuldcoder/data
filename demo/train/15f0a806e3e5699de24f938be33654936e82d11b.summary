-- the erosion of central bank independence around the world threatens to unleash a round of competitive exchange rate devaluations , which leading economies have so far avoided during the financial crisis , the president of @entity3 's @entity2 warned on monday			1
@entity11 , whose institution 's own fierce independence from political influence was the model for the @entity16 when it was founded , said @entity17 , the chief economist at @entity18 , was " perhaps right " in forecasting an end to the era of central bank independence			1
" it is already possible to observe alarming infringements , for example in @entity25 or in @entity26 , where the new government is massively involving itself in the affairs of the central bank , is emphatically demanding an even more aggressive monetary policy and is threatening an end to central bank autonomy , " mr @entity11 said in a speech in @entity22			1
" whether intended or not , one consequence could be the increased politicisation of the exchange rate , " he said , according to a text of his speech provided by the @entity2			1
" until now the international monetary system got through the crisis without competitive devaluations and i hope very much it stays that way			0
" both the @entity2 and later the @entity16 were founded on mandates that gave them wide powers and freedom from political interference in return for focusing solely on keeping inflation in check			2
some observers argue that the @entity16 now faces a challenge if other central banks ditch their own inflation targets and act to lower exchange rates against the euro , making exports from the embattled eurozone economies less competitive			2
asked about the trend for central banks to look less at inflation - targeting and more at policy areas that affect exchange rates , @entity59 , president of the @entity16 , said earlier this month that the exchange rate was very important " as far as growth and stability " were concerned but was not a policy target for the @entity16			0
he also noted that the @entity70 leading industrial nations had pledged not to undertake competitive currency devaluations as such action undermines economic and financial stability			0
mr @entity11 said the period in the 1980s and 1990s during which central banks around the world had been made independent had heralded a period of " great moderation " during which inflation fell			0
but the outbreak of the financial crisis and the growing energy and raw materials demand from fast - growing economies had put rising prices back on the agenda and complicated the job of a central bank			1
this had led to demands on central banks to support the financial system , stimulate the economy and lower government refinancing costs " or even secure the solvency of a state " , he said			0
" overloading central banks with tasks and expectations is however certainly not the correct path towards sustainably overcoming the crisis			0
" the @entity2 chief , whose concerns about straying from orthodox monetary policy prompted him to vote against and campaign openly against mr @entity59 's unlimited bond - buying plan last year , concluded by quoting approvingly from an interview mr @entity59 gave to the @entity0 in december			1
central banks could best defend their independence by narrowly interpreting their mandate , he said			2
