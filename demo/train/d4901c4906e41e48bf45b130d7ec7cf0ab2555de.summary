-- since the beginning of time , man has looked up into the cosmos at those shiny , twinkling stars and thought , " i wonder if lizards would do each other up there ? " so , finally , after all these years , and for the sake of humanity , @entity9 scientists decided to find out once and for all			1
really , it was that or another inconclusive nesting doll experiment			2
and , somehow , stacking little wooden @entity16 does n't quite have the same pizazz as closely monitoring outer - space lizard whoopee			1
thus , the world recently got introduced to @entity9 's brave " @entity20			1
" the idea was this : @entity22 ( @entity9 's federal space agency ) would send five of these little critters into orbit on board a @entity29 - @entity28 satellite to study sexual reproduction in zero gravity			1
four geckos would be female			1
and , for the sake of the experiment , hopefully straight			2
" i do n't know about that guy , @entity36			2
he 's always watching ' @entity37			2
' " assuming that they properly picked out a willing male gecko with a healthy libido , good looks and / or an impressive bank account , their hope was that the quintet of lizards would get into space and then violate each other in the most orderly way possible			2
fortunately , they were @entity9			1
so , i 'm pretty sure the lizards already knew how to queue			2
and if that was n't weird enough , there would also be cameras on board so that scientists back on land could observe the space coitus			1
yes , grown professionals , many with fancy degrees , were literally going to have to sit around and watch live lizard porn			0
so , they had that going for them			0
after choosing the lucky participants , on july 19th @entity22 launched their ( possibly fur - lined ) satellite into space for what they hoped would be two full months of this bizarre @entity68			1
but soon , after just several orbits , things went bad			0
mission control lost contact with the satellite			1
" come in , space sex geckos			1
moan once with desire if you can hear me			0
" days later they were able to reestablish contact			1
however , it was unclear if the life - support system continued to function during the blackout			0
if not , it was unlikely that the geckos would survive			2
on the plus side , had the geckos somehow become aware of their impending doom , i 'm guessing there would 've been several rounds of camera - free , super kinky , we 're - all - going - to - die lizard sex			1
" hey , ladies ! look who brought whipped cream and tiny handcuffs ! " as the @entity22 began sharing updates with the public , it quickly became a running joke online			0
the space sex geckos were suddenly famous to the world			1
but probably dead , for their clumsy end was perilously near			0
which sort of takes the fun out of being international lizard celebrities			0
nevertheless , they were stars			0
even comedian @entity109 , on his @entity110 show " @entity111 , " latched on to the story and started the @entity115 hashtag # @entity113			2
however , on monday , september 1st , a couple weeks short of its intended stay in space , the satellite came crashing back down to @entity119 , where the world finally learned the fate of the space sex geckos			1
in a statement , @entity22 later confirmed their worst fear			0
and the lizards ... they have died			2
frozen and mummified from having expired at least a week prior to impact , the tiny remains of the space sex geckos were recovered from a quiet field where the craft landed			1
but it was n't only death and failure			0
because a colony of fruit flies was also put on board for the mission , and they were found healthy and alive in a different chamber of the satellite			1
and , apparently , they managed to do what the lizards likely could n't			0
in fact , at the expense of @entity147 - knows - how - many rubles , new generations of offspring were conceived while in orbit			0
and now -- lucky us -- the world has more fruit flies			0
follow @ @entity155 on @entity115			0
and prepare to be underwhelmed			0

@entity9 's space agency sent five geckos into space to observe reproduction in zero gravity
that 's right ... space sex geckos
for several days , mission control lost contact with the satellite
if you want to know what happened to the geckos you actually need to read the story
