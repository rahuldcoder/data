his first hours on the stand monday afternoon were spent discussing @entity4 's creativity , saying his voice , songs and dancing were " like no one else in his generation			1
" he will return tuesday to resume his testimony			0
lawyers for @entity4 's mother and children argue in the wrongful death trial against @entity7 that those executives ignored warning signs about his health and mental condition that , if heeded , could have saved his life			1
the lawsuit contends the promoters hired , retained or supervised dr. @entity27 , the physician convicted of involuntary manslaughter in @entity4 's propofol overdose death			1
@entity7 lawyers argue that @entity4 -- not their executives -- chose and controlled the doctor , who was giving him nightly infusions of the surgical anesthetic in a desperate search for sleep in his last two months			2
@entity2 , who knew @entity4 well and worked with him closely preparing his " @entity39 " shows , sounded a warning to @entity7 ceo @entity7 in an e-mail on june 20 , 2009 -- five days before @entity4 's death -- that @entity2 did not think the entertainer would be ready for the shows			1
he described seeing " strong signs of paranoia , anxiety and obsessive - like behavior " with @entity4			1
" i think the very best thing we can do is get a top psychiatrist to evaluate him asap			0
" tabloid report on @entity4 ' @entity54 files ' questioned expert : @entity4 was ' drug dependent , ' not addicted @entity7 says @entity4 was secretive about his drug use , which the company contends was an addiction , so there was no way of knowing what treatments @entity27 was giving @entity4 in his bedroom			1
but a drug addiction expert testified last week that there was " not a lot of evidence to support " the belief that @entity4 was addicted to drugs			1
if he was an addict , @entity4 " would be taking drugs that were not prescribed by a medical professional , taking larger amounts than prescribed and have drug - seeking behavior , " dr. @entity71 testified			1
there was no evidence @entity4 ever took drugs that were not given to him by a doctor or that he took more than prescribed , @entity71 said			2
the bottles of sedatives found in his home after his death had more pills remaining in them than he would have expected if @entity4 was an addict , @entity71 said			2
this " indicated these were not being taken on a regular basis , " he said			0
evidence shows @entity4 sought drugs from a number of doctors , but that was not inappropriate because he needed them " to treat a legitimate medical problem , " including back pain , scalp pain and dermatologic issues , @entity71 testified			2
while not addicted , @entity4 was dependent on drugs , he said			1
the painkillers that forced @entity4 to end his 1993 " @entity101 " tour early so he could enter a rehab program were taken to relieve the pain from scalp surgery needed to repair burns suffered when filming a @entity107 commercial , @entity71 said			2
the burns left scars on damaged nerves in his scalp , which becomes " excitable tissue " that " can be firing just like the nerve , " he said			0
the result " can be every painful , like a burning kind of pain -- persistent , sharp , shooting kind of pain , " he said			0
" it 's very uncomfortable and one of the most difficult to treat			0
" pain relief is a legitimate use of opioid drugs and a person can function normally if they are taken under a doctor 's care , he said			0

" it depends on your political affiliation , " @entity71 answered			0
the @entity142 injections @entity4 got during frequent visits to a @entity145 dermatologist between april and his death in late june 2009 were given for legitimate medical reasons , @entity71 testified			2
if he were addicted to @entity142 -- which is a powerful opioid -- he would not have gone 43 days between injections , which medical records show , he said			0
@entity4 also went roughly 13 years -- from 1993 until 2008 -- without the drug , he said			1
the doctor conceded under cross-examination by an @entity7 lawyer , however , that a gap in available medical records may be misleading			0
@entity4 's use of sedatives was an effort to treat his chronic insomnia , @entity71 said			1
if the underlying sleep problem could be resolved , the chances of ending @entity4 's use of the drugs would have been good , he said			1
there was no indication that @entity4 was addicted to propofol before @entity27 began giving him nightly infusions of the surgical anesthetic for 60 days leading up to his death , he said			1
nephew : @entity4 was murdered unheeded warning signs ? @entity2 , in his e-mail to @entity7 ceo @entity7 on june 20 , wrote that " i honestly do n't think he is ready for this based on his continued physical weakening and deepening emotional state			1
" he said @entity4 was having trouble " grasping the work " at rehearsals			2
production manager @entity182 wrote in an e-mail to @entity7 hours earlier that @entity2 had sent @entity4 home from a rehearsal that night because of his strange behavior			1
" i have watched him deteriorate in front of my eyes over the last 8 weeks			0
he was able to do multiple 360 spins back in april			0
he 'd fall on his ass if he tried now , " @entity182 wrote			0
" he was a basket case and @entity2 was concerned he would embarrass himself on stage , or worse yet -- get hurt			2
the company is rehearsing right now , but the doubt is pervasive			0
" @entity7 replied to @entity2 : " please stay steady			2
it is time to put out the fire , not burn the building down			0
" by " burn the building down , " he meant pulling the plug on the tour that was set to begin in three weeks , @entity7 testified last month			0
" in a highly charged situation like this , i just wanted to keep things calm until we could have the meeting			0
" @entity7 met with @entity27 , @entity4 and @entity2 at @entity4 's home later that day			1
while @entity4 lawyers argue that meeting was intended to pressure @entity27 to make sure @entity4 was ready for rehearsals , @entity7 lawyers contend @entity27 assured producers nothing was wrong			0
@entity7 testified that he remembered little about the conversation at the meeting and @entity27 has invoked his constitutional protection against self - incrimination to avoid testifying in the trial			0
this makes @entity2 's testimony crucial for both sides			1
