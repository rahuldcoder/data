-- arcade game - inspired fashionistas mixing with heavy metal bands grinding out tunes on street corners sounds like a scene you might find in @entity9 's trendier locales			1
but this is @entity11 -- a country with a young population and a thriving underground youth culture			1
last year , @entity16 filmmakers @entity14 and @entity17 traveled to @entity18 and @entity19 in search of a different scene , one which steered clear of the " media stereotypes of violence , @entity26 and safaris			1
" the result is " @entity29 : @entity11 , " an uplifting and colorful 30 - minute documentary which gives a snapshot of the exciting youth scene in some of @entity18 and @entity19 's poorest districts			1
here , you 'll find artists and designers , musicians and photographers , all making their mark on the community and beyond , fashioning an identity for themselves through the things they create , says @entity14			0
" i hope this film is an eye - opener to the stuff happening here , despite media reports of what is going on , " @entity14 said			2
he and @entity17 meet heavy - metal band @entity50 who play sessions to small , but highly appreciative crowds from a backyard in @entity55 , @entity56 , and @entity57 , an electro - pop band from @entity18			2
next , they drop in on the creators of fashion brand @entity61 , which designs street - wear inspired by 1980s arcade games such as @entity66 's " @entity65 , " before catching up with @entity67 , founder of the @entity56 - based " @entity69 " fashion collective			2
" our styles vary from person to person depending on how we absorb what inspires us			0
so we have different fashion icons , but the style definitely has a common thread giving an overall @entity69 aesthetic , " @entity67 said			0
he says the street culture vibe is " very unpredictable and evolving rapidly " because people are realizing how self - expression can be used " as a weapon to shoot your voice for the world to hear			0
" @entity85 , and other street culture movements , are giving voice to a new generation , @entity67 said			0
" @entity93 the youth of @entity11 -- irrespective of their backgrounds and cultural differences -- are starting to take awareness in what 's happening in the world , " he said			1
" they are starting to take a stand by voicing their opinions literally , or by other means of expression			0
" @entity14 agrees , saying that the people he met while filming were incredibly well - informed about the wider social and political world			0
stocktown x : @entity11 is the latest in a series of documentaries in which @entity14 and @entity17 have explored underground urban music scenes in @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 and the @entity112			1
he hopes this latest film , which last week premiered at the @entity116 film festival in @entity16 will , in some small way , encourage young people outside @entity11 to look in on the continent 's growing pool of creative talent .			2
