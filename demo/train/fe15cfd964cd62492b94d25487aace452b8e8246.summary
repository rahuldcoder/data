-- as yet another presidential election cycle ends , it 's a good time not only to tally wins and losses , but to reflect on the nature of the @entity7 political system and why it so often disappoints voters and presidents alike			1
think of the extravagant hopes and promises that attended @entity13 's election in 2008			1
@entity13 surely had good historical grounds for thinking that the seismic financial upheaval of 2009 presented him with opportunities to transform @entity7 for the better			1
and so it did , to a degree his own reelection campaign somewhat mysteriously chose not to emphasize , by creating the political space for major legislative victories like the @entity22 and the @entity24 financial reforms			2
but those achievements fell measurably short of candidate @entity13 's aspirations , and were matched by precious few other initiatives that met the expectations arising from the 2008 campaign			1
opinion : five things @entity13 must do this time around a chastened @entity13 notably failed to offer a grand vision for the @entity7 future and instead contented himself with delegitimizing @entity34 and dwelling for the most part on small - bore issues			1
what is it about the @entity7 presidency , anyway ? every four years , @entity7 become besotted with presidential politics			1
indeed , in the media - marinated age of the " perpetual campaign " the besotting has no fixed cycle , quadrennial or otherwise			0
though for more than a century near majorities of eligible voters have not bothered to cast ballots in presidential elections , none today can escape the saturation news coverage , ubiquitous advertising , and relentless prattle of the chattering classes that attend the contest for the @entity55			2
no other country spends so much of its time choosing its top - level political leadership			2
the @entity59 and the @entity60 usually get the job done in less than six weeks			0
the @entity63 , as a rule , take no more than three			0
@entity66 's longest campaign ever , in 1926 , lasted just 74 days			2
and no other people pour such vast buckets of money into their electioneering as the @entity7 -- some $ 6 billion in the current round			1
perpetual presidential politicking is as @entity7 as apple pie -- and a darn sight more expensive			1
and as for the candidates , what makes them run ? in a nation long schooled to believe that any child can grow up to be president , an astonishing number of men of outsized ambition ( and at least a few women ) have taken the lesson to heart			0
news : @entity34 only prepared a victory speech they have devoted virtually their entire adult lives to seeking the presidency			2
they have plotted , maneuvered , schemed , bargained , cajoled , begged , exalted and often humiliated themselves in pursuit of the prize			0
once in hand , the long - coveted office has sometimes made but more frequently broken them			0
@entity99 and @entity100 , two examples of the relatively few presidents who can be counted as successful , largely realized their grandest aims -- though in both cases the presidency cost them their lives , one by assassination , the other through catastrophic overwork and consequent self - neglect			1
more often , in the case of otherwise accomplished and respected men , the presidency has merely cost them their reputations			2
for the likes of @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 -- each of them celebrated masters of their pre-presidential domains -- the presidency proved a career - killing heart - breaker			2
sixteen hundred @entity125 has been the scene of many bitter disappointments , as well as some tragedies of epic , @entity130 proportions			0
in light of that dispiriting history , why would anyone wish the travails of the presidency upon himself ? as president @entity136 put it in 1881 , after just a few months in office : " my @entity139 ! what is there in this place that a man should ever want to get into it ? " yet men have wanted it , desperately , including @entity34 and @entity13			1
both of them might answer @entity136 's question by saying , simply , that the @entity150 is a matchless place from which to serve one 's country			2
but as @entity136 and other presidents -- including @entity13 -- learned , the @entity7 presidency is a truly peculiar institution , with less power in actuality than folklore has it			1
the president and vice president are but two of the 537 elected officials in @entity165			0
surrounding the @entity55 is a political playing field mined with enough vetoes to stymie even the most ambitious of men			2
news : @entity170 expands majority in governor 's mansions yes , modern presidents oversee a vast 21st - century machinery of state whose operations touch almost every corner of @entity7 life			1
but they share executive authority with 50 governors ; and many government entities , such as the @entity183 , are formally independent of presidential control			2
the president has no official voice in the legislative process , save for his own veto , which can be overridden by congressional super-majorities			0
he can nominate federal judges and @entity192 justices , but they must receive @entity194 confirmation , and in any case serve for life in a proudly independent judiciary			0
he is the commander in chief , but the @entity198 reserves to @entity199 the right to declare war			0
it is not simply the lust for power , however constitutionally jacketed it might be , that fuels men 's and women 's appetites for the office ; it deserves to be acknowledged that love of country is among the reasons that so many good people , including @entity13 and @entity34 , have pined for the opportunity to serve			1
yet contrary to the balladeer 's promises , in politics no less than in romance , love is not enough , and it rarely , if ever , conquers all			2
opinion : @entity13 will get little time to celebrate this is the hard lesson that @entity13 has learned in the last four years as president			1
he is a devoted patriot who in his 2009 inaugural address praised the @entity227 , whose " ideals still light the world			0
" he excited effusive affection among his countrymen on his way to winning the presidency in 2008			2
but the last four years have seen no deepening love affair between the president and his people			0
on the contrary , the ardor of his supporters has measurably cooled , and some have jilted him altogether			0
his detractors have multiplied and hardened against him			0
and events have tempered even his extravagantly idealistic vision of his country			0
the president 's frustrations have derived not simply from the septic political climate of our times , but at least as much from a set of mechanisms carefully crafted by those same hallowed founders more than two centuries ago			1
generations of schoolchildren have been taught to reverence the " checks and balances " the framers stitched so artfully into the @entity198			0
less frequently noted are the liabilities that were integral to their design			0
they deliberately constructed the @entity7 governmental system so that it would be difficult to operate , the presidency in particular			1
what do you think of the election results ? share your reaction			0
their colonial experience with the @entity59 crown and royal governors made them especially wary of executive power , and though the presidency was one of their cleverest innovations in that long - ago @entity280 summer , they hedged it about with constraints and counterbalances to ensure that no president would ever accrue anything remotely resembling monarchical authority			1
small wonder that over the arc of @entity7 history only a handful of presidents can be said to have effected truly lasting transformational change -- @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity120 and perhaps @entity292 make the short list , but few others do , and that 's no accident			1
americans may yearn for strong leadership , but in their stubborn contrariness they do not want truly powerful leaders			0
they may want effective government , but they apparently like divided government even more , when neither party simultaneously controls @entity55 , @entity194 , and presidency -- the situation we 've been saddled with for 31 of the last 43 years			1
so it should not be surprising that @entity13 's accomplishments marked the narrow limits of the achievable			1
they triggered a vicious political backlash in the 2010 election , ushered in yet another round of divided government , and may yet prove but short - lived reminders of the young president 's aspirations , not permanent features of the @entity7 landscape			1
we are a democracy , and can not escape the logic of the venerable maxim that we have the government we have chosen and that we deserve			0
like it or not , @entity13 's first term confirmed that our inherited governmental system worked according to its design specifications			1
the season of effective , vigorous presidential leadership had but the briefest half - life ; the wheels of the constitutional machinery designed to hem the president in began to turn almost from his first day in office , as did the gears of our often perversely contradictory political culture			0
within two years we had stalemate , and the blame game began in earnest			0
analysis : @entity13 won with a better ground game but in the last analysis we have no one to blame but ourselves , and our inherited political system -- and we have no plausible reason to expect anything substantially different in @entity13 's second term			1
from all appearances we are most probably in for a repeat performance of the last two years : a remarkably disciplined and decidedly intransigent @entity170 party dominating the @entity55 , a paper - thin and fragile @entity348 majority in the @entity194 , and a diminished , dispirited , and check - mated president with little or no room for maneuver -- and this in the face of perhaps the greatest fiscal challenge in the history of the republic , an increasingly volatile international environment , and a raft of unfinished business like devising coherent national energy and immigration policies			0
so why do we get so overheated about the presidency ? why do n't we generate some heat about the antiquated system of which the president is but one , too often hapless , part ? what is it about divided government , anyway ? if even as committed a change agent as @entity13 is doomed to four more years of nothing more than lilliputian , small - beer tinkering ; if the self - described greatest power in the world is so powerless to put its house in order , is n't it time for a thorough overhaul of our manifestly antiquated political machinery ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity383 .			1

@entity385 : @entity13 's achievements fell short of his aspirations
@entity383 : @entity7 political system often disappoints voters and presidents
he says the presidency has less power in actuality than folklore has it
