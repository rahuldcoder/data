-- @entity1 is n't known for being a big player on the baseball field , but one man is hoping for a home run with his documentary about the sport			1
an @entity9 filmmaker has made what he describes as ' a love letter to the game sent from a place you 'd least expect			1
' @entity15 hopes that his snap shot of youth baseball in the @entity19 country will raise the profile of the sport in a part of the world where he says it means so much to its players			1
" i 'm constantly dissatisfied with the way people react to @entity27 and the third world in general , and that sort of became my goal to shift the way people think about @entity27 , " @entity15 explained			0
" what better way to shift the way @entity9 think about @entity27 better than baseball , the game they love and i love , too , " he continued			1
his documentary , called @entity40 , focuses on @entity1 's @entity42 network			1
a sport that may still be in its fledgling stages but is growing bigger by the day			0
@entity15 explains that he ended up in @entity1 when he was doing commercial work for @entity46			1
it was there that he met a man from @entity50 , called @entity51 , who was passionate about bringing the sport to @entity1			1
" he showed me this stack of @entity56 pictures basically of a swamp in the middle of nowhere and he told me he 's going to build this beautiful baseball facility , " he said			0
it was a project that @entity51 began working on in 2002			0
@entity15 says that thanks to his hard work there are now two baseball fields in @entity1			1
but @entity15 says what really shocked him when he went to visit the fields was the kids			0
" i was expecting to see some really basic baseball , kids just picking up a ball for the first time and learning how to throw or swing the bat , but that 's not what i saw , " he said			0
" they were really good , they knew how to play			0
" around 15,000 children are signed up to the league now but with about 700 gloves between them more funding is desperately needed			1
however , @entity15 says that it 's the lack of money that produces such impressive players in @entity1			1
" these kids just play , they do n't even have a field to play on or a ball , they 'll make a ball out of plastic bag that they singe and just throw it , " @entity15 said			1
" that 's why they are so good ; they play for the right reasons			0
if they play because they love it , they 'll win , " he said			0
the team @entity15 filmed did win			2
he followed a group of 11 and 12 - year - old boys from the ghettos of @entity99 , who became the first @entity19 team to ever qualify for the @entity102			1
@entity1 youth baseball team denied @entity9 visas over age discrepancies the team was due to play in the tournament in @entity108 , @entity109 but issues with their visas meant they could n't enter @entity9			1
" as everyone knows , documentation is a problem , not just for @entity1 and not just baseball , but 1 billion kids in the world do n't have documentation for who they are or how old they are , " @entity15 said			1
birth certificates are not routinely given out in @entity1 and many people do not know the day they were born			2
in order to travel a certificate and passport is needed , but it 's a costly process			0
a statement on the @entity42 's website says that if the problems can not be ironed out , @entity42 and @entity128 in @entity27 will only be for the wealthy			2
@entity15 hopes his film will address some of the challenges facing the sport in @entity1 so it can continue to grow			2
" it is baseball at its purest form , its baseball for the love of it , its baseball ... where there should n't be baseball so you have to love it to make it grow			2
" the filmmaker says that it 's this love of baseball that joins kids together against a backdrop of personal tragedy			2
one boy that features in the documentary is @entity155 , who lives in an equipment shed with up to 8 people			2
@entity15 says that despite the daily hardships he faces , he is an incredible baseball player			0
" he does a lot of things you ca n't teach , he has a natural hand - eye coordination , you just see , his story could end up somewhere special , " he said			0
" he strikes you as this shy , timid , quiet boy but when he gets on the field , he 's the leader , he 's the loudest one out there , holding huddles for the team , but he 's the man , and i love watching that			0
