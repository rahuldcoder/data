the @entity0 has sent out a warning to hospitals about a new antibiotic - resistant bacteria , carbapenem - resistant @entity4 , or @entity5			1
while this strain of bacteria is not new , it has become more common in the last 10 years or so and has now become prevalent enough to warrant a higher level of concern			1
it 's worth backing up for a second to discuss what all of this means			0
we use antibiotics to treat bacterial infections			1
when we first started developing antibiotics , such infections were easier to cure			2
but over time , the bacteria evolved			2
they developed the ability to fight the antibiotics that we use			2
they pass on this ability to resist treatment to bacteria that follow			1
over time , we are often forced to develop new antibiotics to beat infections that were previously treated easily			2
news : @entity0 : ' nightmare bacteria ' spreading this is what has happened here with @entity5			1
over time , these bacteria have become harder and harder to treat			2
the old antibiotics do n't work as well			0
in this case , @entity5 infections kill about half of patients who have bloodstream infections			1
this is more than twice as many people who die from similar infections with antibiotic - susceptible strains			1
right now , @entity5 only are of concern to certain susceptible patients in the hospital			1
it 's not common in the community , and most of the warnings are directed at hospitals , imploring them to take precautions to isolate patients and prevent spread in the inpatient setting			1
the nightmare scenario , though , is that this bacteria will get out into the community			1
this is n't fear - mongering			0
years ago , staphylococcus aureus infections were also relatively easy to treat			1
over time , though , a strain of bacteria , known as @entity67 , or @entity67 , became a problem in hospitals			1
the @entity0 issued warnings to hospitals to take precautions to prevent its spread			1
over time , though , it got out into the community			0
a 2008 study of children who came into an emergency department with skin abscesses , or infections , found that about 75 % of them were caused by @entity67			2
luckily , we still have medications , such as trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole , to treat these infections			0
when that fails , though , things will become even more concerning			0
put another way , when i was training , we would have almost never considered @entity67 as the cause of a skin infection			2
these days , though , we pretty much assume it 's the cause , and treat with stronger drugs			0
most people believe that the injudicious use of antibiotics is to blame for these developments			0
every time we use antibiotics , we give bacteria a chance to evolve			1
we kill off those susceptible to the drugs and leave those that have developed resistance			0
each time we use antibiotics unnecessarily , say to treat a virus , we make the problem worse			0
each time we use them improperly , or for too short a period of time , we do the same			0
these days , we 're putting them in everything , from soap , to lotion , to the food that animals eat			0
this is a real public health issue			1
creating more resistant strains is a serious long - term problem			1
the new warning is panicking a lot of people , but for the wrong reasons			0
you 're very , very unlikely to get a @entity5 infection anytime in the near future			2
it 's important that hospitals work to prevent that problem from getting worse , but almost everyone reading about it this week will be unaffected by it			0
it 's much , much more likely , though , that these same people will ask for antibiotics when they get a cold			0
that 's the kind of thing that will lead to future problems			0
that 's the kind of thing we need to stop now .			0

@entity142 says rise in drug - resistant bacteria @entity5 should concern us all
he says bacterial strains ***--*** like @entity67 a few years ago ***--*** evolve to resist antibiotics
concern is over spread in hospitals now , but bug could get out into community , he says
@entity142 : *misuse* of antibiotics gives bacteria chance to evolve ***--*** a real public health *danger*
