-- in @entity3 's capital city of @entity4 , residents amble down the streets with jugs and insulated cups of all shapes and sizes , sipping yerba mate tea through straws			1
( or perhaps it 's terere , yerba mate 's cold counterpart , served heavy over ice			1
) locals and visitors alike might stroll past a food stall hawking bori bori , a thick soup of corn flour dumplings and chicken			2
there 's also bife koygua to sample , beef smothered with fried onions and topped with a fried egg			2
the more pescatarian - minded might try a bounty of fish like surubi , a type of bottom - dwelling catfish , and dorado , all straight from the @entity33			2
14 things to know about @entity3 but almost everyone will want to encounter one of the country 's most intriguing dishes , which came about as a serendipitous failure			1
@entity41 , which means @entity3 soup , is a misnomer			1
it is not even close to being a soup ; in fact , it 's more akin to a cheesy cornbread			1
as with any national dish , there is a certain amount of lore that stews around its origin			1
legend has it that @entity56 , the corpulent and corrupt president - cum - dictator of @entity3 from 1841 to 1862 , decided one day to feast upon a nice warming bowl of corn soup			1
the cook accidentally put too much corn flour in the soup , and what came out was a solid rather than a liquid			1
fearing @entity56 's notorious iron fist , the cook decided to slice and serve the cake - like soup with a bit of nationalistic advertising as sopa paraguaya			1
to the cook 's luck , @entity56 liked the marketing and , even more so , the newfangled sopa			1
nowadays , its a dish -- the country 's national dish , at that -- most often served at special occasions like @entity82 and weddings , but it 's too good a dish not to make at home from time to time			1
