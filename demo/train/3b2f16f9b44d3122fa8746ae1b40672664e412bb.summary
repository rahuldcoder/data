earlier this year , @entity5 , a 28 - year - old freelance @entity6 photographer and writer , gained @entity9 fame with a set of curious @entity12 photos capturing him in various settings with his " girlfriend			1
" the images depicted a young lady feeding @entity5 and even lovingly wiping ketchup from his face			2
the twist ? " she " was actually @entity5			2
all the photos were single - handedly shot by the unattached @entity5 , with no girlfriend or anyone else involved			1
how -- and why -- he did it @entity5 started blogging about how to create fake couples photos two years ago			1
he calls the practice the " hitori date " or " one - man date			1

looking at these photos makes me feel blissful			0
" anxious to uncover the secrets of his bizarre success , @entity36 tracked down @entity5			2

@entity36 : where did the idea for the " one - man date " photos come from ? @entity5 : sometimes i go to cafes on my own , just to kill time			1
when i look around , i see couples spoon - feeding each other			0
i then have a strong feeling -- i want this too ! in order to have that , i needed a girlfriend , but i did n't have one			2
the platform ( @entity60 ) where i started my blog gathers lots of writers who write on their interests			2
i asked myself , what 's my interest ? " a girlfriend ! " since then i have been blogging my feelings about it			2
unexpectedly , it 's been well received -- everyone wants a lover ! more : 20 most annoying things people do on planes @entity36 : what kind of responses do you get ? @entity5 : most readers comment it 's " interesting " or " fun			1
" some people want to copy my style			0
some say , " i hope you can get a real girlfriend			0
" although there are female readers leaving comments , none of them have said , " let me be your girlfriend			0
" what a grim world ! @entity36 : what do your friends and family think ? @entity5 : my male friends say , " you seem happy ! " but my grandma said she burst into tears after reading my blog because her grandson seems pathetic in these photos			1

i include a step - by - step , pictured guide on my blog			2
i have to bring a tripod with me			0
that 's embarrassing and my heart still races whenever i [ take hitori date photos ]			1
taking a picture on your own may be embarrassing , but think about all the jealousy you 'll get after uploading it on @entity116 -- for that sake , just bear the embarrassment			0
you should also observe what couples do , then practice at home on your own			0
but in order to take the perfect " hitori date " photo , the biggest trick is not having a girlfriend in the first place			1
you wo n't have to take " hitori date " photos if you 've got a girlfriend			1

it was embarrassing even though i did n't start the conversation			0
