@entity0 , @entity1 -- the third and final presidential debate proved to be a substantive , if not sharp , discussion on the major issues facing the nation as both candidates tried in earnest to persuade the small sliver of undecideds to vote for them			1
while foreign policy was the overarching theme , it was no surprise that the domestic economy shared center stage as president @entity16 and @entity17 each sought to score points on the no. 1 issue of this election			1
in two weeks , the long and bitter campaign will come to a close -- barring an election controversy [ shudder the thought ] -- and monday night 's debate will help frame the discussion in the closing days			2
reflecting on the 90 - minute matchup in @entity1 , here are five takeaways : 1			2
heated , but measured disagreements the level of animosity between the two candidates was apparent but unlike last week , it was capped due in a large part to the debate format and setting			0
it is much more difficult to bring a level of personal anger to a boiling point while seated at a table			0
sitting on high chairs with the ability to walk freely on the stage seems to help fuel rage , while sitting together at a table appears to have a cooling affect			0
@entity16 wins final debate , but does it matter ? that 's not to say there were not prickly exchanges -- ok , very prickly exchanges -- or talking over one another during points of contention , but it rarely rose to the level where it appeared the boxing gloves were going to come out			1
from @entity62 to @entity63 and @entity64 to @entity65 -- and the economy -- the candidates opined about challenges facing the nation in this last chance to reach an audience of tens of millions of voters			0
a colleague turned to me several times unprompted during the 90 - minute exchange and said , " i wish all of the debates were like this one			0
it 's the economy , stupid it was a debate about foreign policy , an important subject that plays second fiddle to the no. 1 issue on voter 's minds this election : the economy , the economy and the economy -- ok , in addition to a handful of other domestic issues such as health care , taxes , education , and @entity96			1
funniest tweets from the final debate there was substantive discussion and disagreement on foreign policy during the face - off , but as we noted earlier , the economy received a fair amount of air time			1
@entity17 tried to convince voters the economy was a national security issue that has weakened @entity112 's standing in the world			1
and when presented the opportunity , the @entity115 presidential nominee seized it to again present his five - point plan to revive the sluggish economy that includes creating training programs for workers to helping small businesses grow and thus create more jobs			0
in turn , @entity16 highlighted his administration 's efforts at improving education , while criticizing @entity17 's record on education and small business as governor of @entity131			1
hardly topics that can be classified as foreign policy , yet issues that are paramount to voters			1
analysis : no knockout , but more punches 3			0
commander - in - chief card at strategic points throughout the night , @entity16 played the commander - in - chief card as a way to show that he has had to make the difficult decisions that only a president faces			1
at the top of the debate : " well , my first job as commander in chief , @entity145 , is to keep the @entity112 people safe			1
and that 's what we 've done over the last four years			0
" during a contentious exchange on foreign policy : " here 's one thing i 've learned as commander in chief			1
" and the closer : " as commander in chief , i will maintain the strongest military in the world , keep faith with our troops and go after those who would do us harm			2
but after a decade of war , i think we all recognize we 've got to do some nation - building here at home , rebuilding our roads , our bridges and especially caring for our veterans who sacrificed so much for our freedom			0
" advantage @entity16 , he effectively played the card @entity17 could n't : being commander in chief			1
but @entity17 also saw some benefit in not being president			2
he did n't have to defend a record and was able to talk about his vision for the country without having to answer for any shortcomings			1
presidential debate 's global reaction : disappointment 4			0
@entity112 's role in the world my favorite topic of the night : it is a question that allows a candidate to go big in his vision for the future			0
of course , each candidate took the opportunity to use it to talk in political terms , but not before offering these words of hope -- @entity17 : " i absolutely believe that @entity112 has a responsibility and the privilege of helping defend freedom and promote the principles that make the world more peaceful			1
" @entity16 : " @entity112 remains the one indispensable nation			2
and the world needs a strong @entity112			0
it was a presidential question , appropriate for the final presidential debate			0

closing arguments it is now a race to november 6 as both candidates crisscross the country in search of votes from the small group of battleground states that will decide this election			0
@entity16 wakes up in @entity1 on tuesday and holds a rally before heading to @entity216 for a campaign event with vice president @entity218			2
@entity17 travels out @entity219 to join vice presidential nominee @entity220 for a campaign event in @entity222 before flying to @entity223 for an evening rally			2
in the moments following the debate , @entity16 campaign manager @entity225 was very clear about the political strategy in these final two weeks : " persuading undecideds and turning out your vote			1
" by no means did @entity225 lift back the curtain and provide insight that we did not already know , but it goes to show you that politics is a very basic game -- the person with the most votes wins			0
watch the debate again on @entity2 as for where exactly @entity16 will spend most of his time in these closing days , @entity225 would not commit to particular states but emphasized , " we are going to be very flexible where we go			1
" @entity246 , @entity17 's spokesman , noted that in addition to @entity248 and @entity223 , the former governor will also make stops in @entity216 and @entity251 in the coming days and plans to visit multiple swing states in the same day as part of the effort to turn out the vote			2
if the election stays this tight heading into november 6 , will the traditional 48 - hour closing candidate barnstorm turn into 72 - hour nonstop tours of the nine battleground states ? were your questions answered ? let us know on @entity264			0

foreign policy was theme of last debate , but economic issues also got attention
@entity16 and @entity17 in sharp exchanges , but *showdown* less contentious overall
@entity16 played ' commander - in - chief ' card to highlight foreign policy *decisionmaking*
