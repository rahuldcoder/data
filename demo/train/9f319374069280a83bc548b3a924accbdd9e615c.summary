-- @entity1 has been firmly in @entity3 's corner in recent years , which is quite a shift given that the two nations were historically rivals			1
it seems odd to cheer for a nation whose ancestors tried to kill my mother and destroyed my father 's house , but i do			1
that 's because like @entity1 , @entity3 suffered greatly under @entity17 's oppression , so nothing would please me more than to see @entity3 shake the @entity20 's grip to enjoy freedom and prosperity			1
last summer , i visited @entity23 and @entity24 , @entity3 , hometowns of my mother and father			1
they were @entity1 towns , @entity23 and @entity24 , in 1939 before @entity29 and the @entity30 invaded @entity1 and changed the map			1
the word @entity3 means " borderland , " as this area changed hands many times among @entity37 , @entity1 and @entity38 before an independent @entity3 was established in 1991			1
in the battles over these fertile lands , @entity3 , jews , @entity1 and others faced the horrors of the @entity46 - engineered @entity45 famine , the holocaust , the @entity49 massacre and other bloodbaths			1
both sides of my family endured these atrocities and their estates were destroyed			2
my mother was 11 in 1939 when she watched from a hilltop cemetery in @entity23 as @entity57 fighter planes bombed her house to the ground			2
she moved in with relatives in a village called @entity62 , where she saw @entity57 soldiers march the @entity39 out of town			0
they were taken to a ravine and shot			0
when @entity29 started losing the war , @entity68 @entity3 nationalists murdered @entity1 @entity70 and took their property			1
my mother escaped the massacre by hiding in an outhouse pit covered in feces and leaves			0
trying to flee west , the @entity76 forced her into slave labor clearing dead bodies and collecting scrap metal after allied bombing raids			1
in july , carrying addresses and a map from 1939 , my friend @entity82 and i traveled to @entity23 to find our roots			2
the countryside was abundant with wheat fields and bright sunflowers			0
the town was full of weeping willows and apricot trees , just as my mother had described			0
my family 's restaurant was gone , but i recognized the church from old photos			1
the @entity97 removed the steeple and turned it into a cultural center			0
a new house is being constructed where my grandparents ' house used to be			2
@entity82 had more luck finding his family 's house and with a huge smile , he picked apricots from a tree out front			1
while enjoying the fresh fruit , we walked up the hill to find the spot where my mother watched the bombing of her house and to see whether any tombstones had our families ' names on them			2
we climbed the old steps and found remains of a wrought iron cemetery fence , but the graveyard was gone			0
the 1939 map clearly marked sections of @entity125 , @entity39 and @entity68 graves			0
the tombstones were missing , replaced by a playground			0
a chill came over me watching children kicking around a soccer ball , unaware of the bones buried beneath the rickety gymnastics bars and playground			0
opinion : @entity137 's @entity3 endgame we later found an article on a @entity3 website , revealing that in the 1970s the @entity30 used the tombstones in the construction of a school and a communist committee building			1
the article decried the " sinful deeds of our predecessors " and the " heartless barbaric " act of demolishing the cemeteries			0
the next day , we left for @entity24 , 130 miles away , where my ancestral home was on @entity150 on a hill overlooking the historic city , which was then @entity1 and called @entity24			1
my father was 17 , too young to join the army when @entity29 and the @entity30 invaded @entity1 , but he and his boy scout troop blew up a bridge as a @entity38 army transport was crossing			1
this act of sabotage against the invading army caused a backlash against his family			2
he returned home late one night to find the lights on			2
he peered through the window at @entity38 soldiers waiting for him in the kitchen			0
my grandfather was in custody , and the soldiers were drinking his vodka			0
he never saw his parents , or @entity24 , again			0
my father fled to @entity175 where the @entity1 underground sent him to @entity177 to enlist in the @entity177 army to fight @entity29			1
when @entity177 fell , he was evacuated to @entity179 , and later took part in the @entity182 invasion as a motorcycle scout for a tank unit			0
the house on @entity150 was demolished by the @entity30 out of spite			2
the @entity3 built a soccer stadium in its place , on a hill overlooking the town			1
i found the stadium and noticed a vegetable garden past some bushes and trees			0
beyond the trees was an old red brick villa , just as my father had described			2
i went closer to take photos			0
it had seen better days , but it was clearly an upscale residence when first built			0
an old man emerged from a shed and said , " what are you looking for ? " he was carrying a rake made from a tree branch and twigs fastened with twine			0
i explained that his brick house looked similar to my father 's , which was demolished by the @entity30			1
he said , " yes , there was another house just like this one			2
but when i moved here 60 years ago , it had already been knocked down			0
all that was left was a pile of bricks			0
the @entity97 did not like the people who lived there			2
" opinion : @entity219 divided @entity3 ? think again the old man said the bricks were used to make a kiln to build the stadium			1
everyone in town , including him , was forced to work on the project			0
the mystery of my father 's house had been solved			1
pulling @entity3 money from my pocket , i offered it to the old man and said he should buy himself a drink on me			1
insulted , he pushed my hand away and said , " no. i did not tell you this because i want something from you			0
i told you this because you should know what happened to your father 's house			1
" we nodded politely , and he went back to raking grass to feed to his goats			0
i took pictures of the stadium and noticed that off to one side , was an old kiln made out of aged red bricks , bricks from my father 's house , just as the old man had said			1
part of the kiln was crumbling , so i took one of the bricks with me			0
it 's sitting on my desk as i write this			0
today , @entity3 is still a borderland between a free @entity255 and an authoritarian @entity38			1
my parent 's hometowns are part of @entity3 now , and the people who live there deserve the peace , prosperity and freedom that @entity1 and other countries achieved after breaking from the @entity20 's orbit			1
yes , i 'm cheering for @entity3			2
but looking at this brick from my father 's house that was used to build the stadium , somehow it 's hard to root for @entity24 's soccer club , even if it is technically my home team			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity275 .			2

@entity275 roots for @entity3 despite the suffering of his family there
in battles over the " borderland , " @entity3 , jews , @entity1 and others lived through horrors
his mom saw massacres , worked as slave labor ; *soviets* razed father 's house
on a trip to @entity3 , he searches for his ancestral home and finds much has been lost
