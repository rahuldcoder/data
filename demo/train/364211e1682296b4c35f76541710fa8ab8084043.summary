-- remember when @entity1 was the face of the @entity3 ? it only seems like yesterday she was the @entity3 ' most talked - about candidate for president			1
now she 's gone from prominent voice on @entity7 to a reality tv star whose latest project is a book entitled " a happy holiday is a @entity12			2
" that 's almost as good a book title as @entity16 's " troublemaker : let 's do what it takes to make @entity20 " and way better than the snoozer @entity22 is pushing : " @entity23 : one woman 's journey to reclaim the @entity26			1
" immigration reform may be the aspect of the @entity3 rebranding strategy that gets the most headlines , but heeding gov. @entity32 's call to " stop being the stupid party " also appears to be high on the party 's list			1
hence the marginalizing of @entity1 and the rest of the party 's @entity38			1
in 2010 , the sisterhood was everywhere , speaking in front of big crowds , making stuff up as they went along			0
now they 're at the kids ' table , trying to make room for one more : @entity49			1
" i fully anticipate the mainstream liberal media to put a detrimental spin on my decision not to seek a fifth term , " @entity49 said in a nearly nine - minute video in which she announced that she is not seeking re-election			1
what is @entity49 's legacy ? in another example of what has become the norm for conservatives who become annoyed by facts , @entity49 pointed a finger at the so - called mainstream liberal media and not at her former national field coordinator , @entity65 , who filed an ethics complaint			1
she 's accusing the media of spin instead of owning up to the fact that @entity70 @entity3 have quietly shunned her or that her well - documented penchant for massaging the truth has drawn criticism from conservatives such as @entity76			1
in april 2009 , while arguing against climate change on the @entity70 floor , @entity49 said , " there is n't even one study that can be produced that shows that carbon dioxide is a harmful gas			1
" in 2011 , in regards to hpv vaccination , she said a mother told " me that her little daughter took that vaccine , that injection , and she suffered from mental retardation thereafter			0
it can have very dangerous side effects			0
" this year , she gave a speech at the @entity95 , slinging hunks of red - meat untruths about president @entity98 , and when she was questioned about the facts of her speech by @entity0 's @entity101 , she ran away			2
@entity49 said she is not disappearing and vows to keep fighting for @entity103 , a thought i 'm sure makes @entity108 chairman @entity107 cringe			1
he 's trying to limit the number of ignorant , controversial statements that derailed more than one campaign during the 2012 election			1
@entity49 is a walking ignorant , controversial statement waiting to happen			1
" we have to be persistent but patient , " @entity107 said in response to the handful of notable republicans who have suggested impeaching @entity98 over the @entity119 scandal			0
" i think where there 's smoke , there 's fire			2
if we present ourselves to the @entity103 people as intelligent , we 're going to be in a great place as far as showing that this administration is not transparent , is obsessed with power and hates dissent			0
but you do n't call for impeachment until you have evidence			0
" @entity49 looks forward to future , but not in the @entity70 @entity49 said it was worse than @entity137 , and no , she presented no evidence to support such claims			1
the fact is , the brand of spitfire politics @entity141			0
employ is usually not patient or intelligent			0
it 's often irresponsible hyperbole designed to generate buzz as opposed to inform			2
if directed properly , it 's an effective way to win an election			0
but the problem with spitfire is that it 's sometimes hard to control			0
the sisterhood was hard to control , and on more than one occasion , the party was burned because of it			0
that 's why slowly , methodically , politically , the most famous members of 2010 's sisterhood have been extinguished , done in by the fact that far too often they had no idea what they were talking about			0
think about it : three years ago , @entity1 was a rock star who had @entity162 on the run			1
now she 's writing a @entity12 book			0
thankfully , @entity165 was too levelheaded to be a part of the group			0
unfortunately , @entity168 was too levelheaded to stay a part of @entity170			2
one can only hope scrubbing stupid away can help bring respect back to a party that handed a lot of it over in exchange for the 2010 midterm election			2
assuming @entity49 survives the ethics investigation , i 'm sure a new book is in her future as well			2
i just hope bookstores have the good sense to put it under " fiction			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity186 .			2

@entity49 announced her plan to leave @entity170 at end of term
@entity186 says it 's *progress* in @entity3 effort to stop being " the stupid party "
@entity49 was one of a number of @entity3 figures who spoke *nonsense* , he says
@entity186 : @entity1 , @entity16 have faded into the *background*
