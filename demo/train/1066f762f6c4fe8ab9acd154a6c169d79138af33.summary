the chair , perhaps the most famous chair in political history , stands in the office of a large , nondescript cement building just a stone 's throw away from the @entity7			0
that 's right , the chair @entity9 used as a prop in his rambling and at times incoherent critique of president @entity13 at the @entity14 is now one of the many pieces of political memorabilia in @entity19 ' spacious office on @entity20 in @entity21			1
the chairman of the @entity23 gets the joke ; the chair is the first thing he points out to a reporter before sitting down behind his desk to discuss how his party must dramatically rethink its strategy and message in hopes of recovering from the national drubbing of 2012			0
the second collector 's item he shows off is a yellow foam cheesehead autographed by @entity38 quarterback @entity37			0
it reads : " to @entity19 , from one qb to another , best wishes ! @entity37			2
" @entity37 might be on to something			0
as @entity14 chairman , @entity19 is n't calling the plays : that 's up to @entity48 @entity14 leadership and the ambitious @entity50 governors roaming state capitols around the country			1
but he is reading the other team and making crucial adjustments to the game plan			0
@entity19 is also the general manager , responsible for helping build the team and manage the expectations of ownership			1
and he has many owners to answer to : 168 republicans who make up the national committee , deep - pocketed donors who write the checks , grass - roots activists who provide conservative energy , and the lawmakers who have an immediate personal stake in the party 's success			0
@entity70 says @entity13 's focus is to ' annihilate the @entity50 ' a two - tiered goal to restructure , rebrand @entity50 that 's why @entity19 is developing a political plan he hopes , in the near term , will re-energize his party in time for the 2014 midterm elections , while also developing a long - term strategy to compete among key demographic voting blocs -- hispanic , @entity81 , @entity80 -- that broke so heavily @entity83 in november			1
to hear @entity19 tell it , the goal is two - tiered : restructure the party on a tactical level to match the sophisticated and data - driven efforts of the @entity13 campaign , and create a communications plan to sell the @entity50 's message to voters it failed to connect with in 2012			1
@entity50 's surprising edge on diversity it 's an overwhelming task and it 's going to cost money , lots of money			1
" i 've been meeting with donors since the election in november , " @entity19 said			1
" i would say i am pleasantly surprised how quickly the donors who have given so much are ready to build a party that is a year - round operation			0
" @entity105 : @entity50 , play offense in @entity13 's second term as he reflected on the presidential race , it quickly became clear that one of the most bothersome aspects of the presidential race was the marathon debate schedule			1
the primary debates were a point of frustration for some republicans , who felt the process was controlled by the news media , not the party , in the past election			0
" i believe that no. 1 , we have to control the debates , " @entity19 said			2
" i think that having over 20 debates is too many , and i think we ought to regulate the debates , pick the moderators and get involved in setting the calendar			0
" @entity19 cautioned his comments are not set in stone and he described his ideas in " hypothetical " terms			2
one idea he mentioned was instituting a penalty system in which candidates for the nomination would lose a percentage of delegates if they participated in a debate not sanctioned by the @entity14			2
dark horse candidates hungry for media attention would likely oppose such a move , but it 's unclear if they would have the power to prevent a change in the rules			0
the idea of handpicking moderators would also face stiff opposition from the media organizations who foot the bill to stage and broadcast the debates			0
primary calendar needs to be condensed as for the primary calendar , @entity19 said he would like to see it condensed to allow the eventual @entity50 nominee more time to prepare for the general election			1
in an ideal world , he said , the intra-party fight would start later and finish sooner , with the @entity14 possibly being held as early as june			2
but he does n't talk about changing the order of the four leadoff primary and caucus states -- @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 -- that have traditionally kicked off the nomination process			0
" i think that the carve - out states have served us well , but i think the timing of the calendar and the rest of the calendar issue should be looked at , " he said			0
@entity19 rejected the notion of the @entity14 becoming involved in presidential primaries to assist the strongest candidate , but he was quick to point out that state @entity14 parties can choose to play in primaries if they want			1
" state parties can decide for themselves , " he said			0
" it 's their choice			0
" in terms of outreach to minorities , @entity19 said the @entity50 failed to pass a very basic test			1
attracting minority voters a key @entity50 goal as @entity13 begins second term " well , for one thing , we have to ask for the vote , " he said			1
" you have to ask for it and i do n't think that we 've been doing a very good job of that			0
" @entity19 said a glaring organizational flaw for @entity50 is that there have been no long - term investments made in human capital to help sell the @entity50 message on a neighborhood to neighborhood level			1
it 's more than just having an outreach director in a state -- it 's having dedicated , full - time staffers on a grass - roots level to run " voter registration , hold community events , go to swearing - in ceremonies ... having real job descriptions for lots and lots of people on a yearlong basis in communities that move the dial			2
" the party 's standing among @entity223 emerged as a damaging sore spot last year for national republicans , who were forced to answer for hard - line immigration positions from prominent conservative figures , including their own presidential nominee			0
@entity13 won with 71 % of the @entity223 vote , according to @entity231 national exit polls			2
outreach to @entity223 has already begun , @entity19 says " i think you are seeing a lot of movement from our party on these issues , " said @entity19 , who said outreach has already begun			2
" a lot of it , i tell you , was tone			0
you know , it was n't necessarily the policy on immigration , it was what is coming out of your mouth			0
" he specifically mentioned a comment by @entity14 presidential nominee @entity253 , who suggested illegal immigrants might " self - deport " and leave the country willingly			2
" when you talk about stuff of self - deportation , it is probably not the best place to start , " @entity19 said			2
still , @entity19 said he believes that @entity50 , not @entity83 , better represent the ideals and goals of all voters , including minorities who turned out in droves to re-elect the president			1
@entity19 plans to explain his vision for the overhaul of his party in more detail to the 168 @entity14 members who arrive in @entity272 , @entity273 , this week for a three - day meeting that will focus almost entirely on this subject			1
five @entity14 heavyweights -- @entity277 , @entity278 , @entity279 , @entity280 and @entity281 -- are helping @entity19 craft the recovery plan , dubbed " @entity284			1
" just as @entity13 asked @entity83 to nominate him as their presidential nominee in @entity272 in september , @entity19 will ask @entity14 members on friday to elect him to another two - year term			1
it will be more of a formality than an election , because @entity19 has only token opposition and has locked down enough support to maintain his role as chairman			1
" both the grass - roots and the donors have to be on the same page , and i think i am in a unique position to do that , " he said			0
@entity19 predicts a more ' granular ' approach for @entity50 @entity19 is in a unique position because of his financial stewardship of the national committee , which two years ago was saddled with nearly $ 25 million in debt after the departure of controversial former @entity14 chairman @entity306			1
" our money situation here was so bad that both credit cards were suspended when i walked in the door , " he said			0
" so when we went to go book travel or anything like that , we did n't have a credit card to put the travel on			1
fortunately , we had my two credit cards , so we maxed out both of those cards			0
" @entity19 estimated he spent $ 40,000 to $ 50,000 on his personal credit cards , which he was eventually reimbursed			2
dialing for dollars became @entity19 ' priority , a tough task for a depressed donor base that saw super pacs and the congressional campaign committees as viable alternatives to the poorly managed @entity14			1
when he started as chairman , @entity19 said there were fewer than 100 major @entity14 donors , people who contributed more than $ 15,000 per year			1
by the close of his first year , he said 1,000 people were donating $ 30,000 - plus each year			0
paperwork filed with the @entity333 showed the @entity14 ended 2012 with about $ 3.3 million in the bank and no debt			2
unlike two years ago , @entity19 wo n't have to use his own credit card to pay for his plane ticket to @entity272			1
now the big question is whether he will be able to raise enough money to transform the party , and if he can , will his fellow @entity50 embrace his plan ?			0

@entity19 , who engineered *turnaround* in @entity50 's finances , is up for re-election
@entity14 was so far in debt when @entity19 took job that he had to use own credit card to travel
@entity19 says @entity50 must attract women , minorities , who delivered election to @entity13
@entity14 chairman says marathon debate schedule in primaries hurt @entity50 in general election
