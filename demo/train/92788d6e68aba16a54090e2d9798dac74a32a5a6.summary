congressional leaders agreed thursday on the need for a full investigation of what one called a recent " cascade " of leaked classified information but differed on exactly how the inquiry should be conducted			1
after meeting with director of national intelligence @entity7 , the top @entity9 and @entity10 on the intelligence committees of the @entity12 and @entity13 pledged a bipartisan effort to halt the leaks now and pass legislative changes to prevent future leaks			1
however , the chairwoman of the @entity13 panel , democrat @entity20 of @entity21 , was reluctant to immediately seek a special prosecutor to investigate the leaks involving a cyberwarfare program against @entity25 and other intelligence matters			1
the @entity12 panel chairman , @entity27 rep. @entity27 of @entity28 , made clear he believed an outside investigation was necessary			2
@entity31 's @entity30 : @entity32 has been ' very tough ' on leakers meanwhile , an intelligence source told @entity31 that @entity7 wants more government employees to be subject to an enhanced lie detector test as a deterrent to leaking classified information			1
in particular , @entity7 wants to widen the numbers of people across government agencies who would be required to take the " counterintelligence polygraph , " the source said			0
the move would be aimed at government employees who hold top - secret clearance			0
as of now , not everyone with that clearance level is required to take the enhanced polygraph , which , the source said , would have questions added such as whether the employee has passed information to journalists			0
@entity7 and " every member of the leadership team in the intelligence community " are angry about the series of leaks , sen. @entity56 of @entity57 , the ranking @entity10 on the @entity13 panel , said after thursday 's meeting			1
the meeting came amid bipartisan outrage over a report in the @entity68 last week that provided classified details of what it described as a @entity73 cyberattack targeting @entity25 's nuclear centrifuge program			2
some @entity10 led by veteran sen. @entity75 of @entity76 alleged that the @entity12 must be knowingly involved because of the nature of the leaked information			1
the @entity12 rejects the accusations			2
@entity80 : @entity75 's claims on leaks ' a sad statement ' " any suggestion that the @entity12 has leaked sensitive information for political purposes has no basis in fact and has been denied by the authors themselves , " @entity85 spokesman @entity84 said thursday			1
the intelligence committee leaders met later thursday with fbi director @entity94 , whose agency is investigating the leaks , according to legislators			2
afterward , @entity20 , who chairs the @entity98 , said that the @entity73 attorney in @entity100 also is investigating			1
after the briefing from @entity7 , the four committee leaders said they were united in their commitment to address the problem			0
" to have all four of us come forward today and talk about the severity of these leaks , i hope , sends a very clear message about how dangerous this has become , " @entity27 said			0
analysts : ' the ship of state always leaks ' he pushed for an outside investigation , saying that " if we 're going to make this nonpartisan , if we 're going to make this fair and complete , which means it has to follow the leads which they have , you 're going to have to have at least some sort of an outside look			0
" in particular , @entity27 noted problems uncovered in his panel 's investigation of an unspecified leak , saying the committee " has materials suggesting that the agencies were directed to expand the scope of classified information they gave to the press			1
" " we know , in some cases , someone from a segment of the media was present in a classified setting , " @entity27 said without elaborating			0
@entity20 , when asked whether a special prosecutor should be appointed , said she was more concerned with adding restrictions on access to classified information and other steps to an intelligence appropriations measure now before the committee			1
" a special prosecutor can take years			0
we do n't have years , " @entity20 said , adding that she was " delaying that decision			2
" @entity151 chief plans more lie detectoring testing to deter leaks while the cyberwarfare report brought this week 's public condemnation , the issue touches on a longstanding dispute between @entity158 and the federal government over intelligence information			2
" this charge is made in every administration , " sen. @entity161 , @entity162 , a member of the @entity163 , said thursday			0
" sometimes it 's accurate			0
sometimes it should lead to accountability and sanctions , but i think we 're at the very early stages of this			0
" other recent possible leaks of classified information included details on the administration 's efforts to expand its drone program and president @entity32 's involvement in " kill lists " against militants in @entity183 and @entity184			1
also , the public airing of details surrounding a recently disrupted bomb plot in @entity183 by @entity188 angered intelligence and national security officials			1
" there is no more important issue that we have to work on than this issue , " @entity56 said			0
he and his colleagues said the leaks put lives at risk and damage the credibility of the @entity73 in the intelligence community			2
@entity201 becomes involved rep. @entity202 of @entity203 , the top @entity204 on the @entity12 panel , said a cultural change was needed that would require a partnership between the administration and both chambers of @entity158			2
the @entity13 panel is expected to add leak provisions to the fiscal year 2013 intelligence authorization bill this month			0
although the @entity12 has passed a version of the bill without the leak provisions , they would probably be added during negotiations with the @entity13 on a final version			0
in its report friday , the @entity68 said that , since shortly after he became president , @entity32 has ordered cyberattacks targeting computers that run @entity25 's nuclear enrichment facilities			0
it attributed the information to participants in the program			0
@entity75 , the ranking @entity10 on the @entity228 , alleged that the @entity12 authorized the leaks for political gain			1
" these leaks clearly were not done in the interest of national security or to reveal corrupt or illegal actions about which the public has a right to know , as in the case of legitimate whistleblowers , " @entity75 said			1
" it is difficult to escape the conclusion that these recent leaks of highly classified information , all of which have the effect of making the president look strong and decisive on national security in the middle of his re-election campaign , have a deeper political motivation			1
" " this administration has been blatantly political on all national security issues that i 've been observing , " @entity75 told @entity31 's @entity250 on thursday			1
" i think it 's very clear that these leaks came from people within the @entity12 itself and these people are very politically oriented			2
" he , too , called for a special counsel to look into the matter			0
the @entity12 pushed back , with spokesman @entity260 saying that " this administration takes all appropriate and necessary steps to prevent leaks of classified information or sensitive information that could risk ongoing counterterrorism or intelligence operations			1
" since @entity32 took office in january 2009 , his administration has greatly increased use of the @entity271 to prosecute alleged leakers of classified information			2
six prosecutions have been launched under the act by the administration , which is double the total from all previous administrations , according to @entity279 , director of the @entity280 for the @entity100 - based @entity281			0
@entity260 said thursday that @entity32 " has demonstrated his commitment to transparency through the variety of steps he has taken , unprecedented in @entity73 presidential administration history			0
" but he is also president and commander in chief , and he will not countenance the leaking of classified information that can harm our men and women in uniform , harm @entity73 who work on our national security , harm counterterrorism operations , " @entity260 said .			1
