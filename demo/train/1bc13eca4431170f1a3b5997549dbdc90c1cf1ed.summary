@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 , which has been late to the @entity5 race , announced detailed plans for its faster , fourth - generation network on wednesday while showing its first 4g smartphones			1
the carrier has begun upgrading its network to a protocol with the awkward name of @entity13 + and that is faster than today 's @entity15			1
that process will ramp up this year , said @entity3 executives at a developers conference here during the @entity20			1
during the second half of the year , @entity3 plans to begin rolling out a more advanced technology called @entity23 ( @entity23 ) , which is very similar to the 4g network @entity25 launched late last year			1
both protocols are expected to allow smartphone users to upload and download mobile web data faster than current 3g networks			0
executives for @entity3 , the second - largest @entity31 carrier by subscribers , were careful to distinguish between the two infrastructures because they believe that having both provides a technical edge			1
@entity35 , which claims to have the nation 's largest 4g network , has only deployed @entity13 +			1
@entity25 skipped over that technology in favor of the faster lte			2
and @entity40 uses something entirely different			0
@entity3 says having both technologies in place lets users , when out of range of an @entity5 network , fall back on the still - fast @entity13 +			1
@entity3 ceo @entity47 boasted that as " something our competitors will not be able to match			2
" yet , in an identity crisis that seems to plague the wireless industry , @entity3 marketing chief @entity50 blurred the lines during his speech			2
phones carrying the moniker " @entity5 " will have only the soon - to - be - dated @entity13 +			0
@entity50 said the carrier 's " blockbuster lineup of @entity5 tablets " will be led by a touchscreen computer with @entity13 + from @entity58 , which will come out in the spring or summer			2
a tablet with the faster @entity23 chip will debut in the second half of the year , he said			1
unlike competitors , @entity3 says it 's upgrading cellular sites that receive the most demand , rather than focusing on rollouts in entire cities			1
the other three major carriers launched @entity5 networks in piecemeal -- first rolling out the network , along with @entity5 laptop cards , and then releasing smartphones for them			2
@entity40 and @entity35 were without phones to take advantage of their speedier networks for months			0
@entity25 has yet to unveil its 4g phones , but the company is expected to do so on thursday			0
@entity3 plans to release 20 devices with @entity5 , starting with @entity13 + phones in the next few months			1
@entity23 phones will come in the latter half of the year , around the same time as the launch of that network			1
smartphone manufacturers @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity58 joined @entity3 on the stage wednesday to show their first few 4g phones for @entity3			0
" @entity3 is moving ahead so quickly with their 4g rollout , and we are part of that , " said @entity87 ceo @entity90 at the event			0
" in this era of breakneck technology change , many people want more			0
" @entity100 , @entity58 's mobile president , says the company will add another phone , called the @entity103 , to its @entity105 lineup			0
the @entity107 smartphone is very thin and has a 4.5 - inch touchscreen -- larger than most rival models			0
it will also have an 8 - megapixel camera on the back and another on the front			0
@entity86 's @entity115 phone will have a sure - to - be - fast dual - core processor inside , allowing it to pump out 1080p high - definition video through an @entity119 port .			0
