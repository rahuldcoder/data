-- this election season , the term " @entity2 " has escaped from the obscure world of campaign finance lawyers to emerge on the front pages of major newspapers and political websites			1
@entity9 are political organizations that can take unlimited sums from individuals , corporations and labor unions to spend in support of , or opposition to , federal candidates			2
to do so legally , a @entity2 must avoid certain forms of coordination with candidates			2
the groups played a big role in @entity23 , with a @entity24 , " @entity29 , " widely credited with running ads that halted @entity27 's momentum in the polls			2
they are expected to play an even greater role in the fall , when control of the @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity37 @entity36 will be up for grabs			0
@entity9 are troublesome for a number of reasons			2
they tend to run more negative advertising , since they are able to act as the " evil twin " of campaigns because they are not accountable to voters the way candidate committees are			0
thanks to holes in our disclosure laws , which neither @entity54 nor the @entity56 commissioners on the @entity57 have seen fit to fix , we do n't know who is funding many of the @entity9			2
candidates can even raise money under certain conditions for supportive @entity9 without violating the @entity57 's technical coordination rules			2
and thanks to clever campaign finance lawyers who can use an affiliated nonprofit 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) group , we may never know the identity of some donors			0
( that 's why comedian @entity70 formed his 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) " @entity74 " ( as in " hush " ) to funnel money to his regular " @entity73			0
" ) but the greatest danger of @entity9 is that they may skew the legislative process in the next @entity54 in favor of the interests of large @entity2 contributors			1
to understand why , we need to go back to the @entity82 's controversial 2010 opinion in @entity83			1
in that case , the @entity82 held that the @entity85 barred a federal law preventing corporations and unions from spending their own funds to influence the outcome of elections			1
key to this ruling was the court 's statement that independent spending ( that is , spending not coordinated with candidates ) can not corrupt the political process			0
from there , lower courts and the @entity57 , spurred by opponents of campaign finance regulation , led the way for the creation of @entity9			1
as i have explained , first they concluded that if independent spending can not corrupt , then an individual 's contributions to an independent group can not corrupt			0
( @entity110 was the $ 5,000 per person contribution limit to political action committees -- or @entity9 -- which only spend independently to support or oppose federal candidates			0
) second , they concluded that if an individual 's contributions to one of these @entity9 can not corrupt , then neither can a corporation 's or a labor union 's contribution			0
( corporations now have a way to influence elections anonymously , thus avoiding the risk of alienating customers who may object to their choice of candidates			0
) but the initial supposition is wrong			0
the main reason the @entity82 has rejected challenges to campaign contribution limits ( currently set at $ 2,500 per election to federal candidates ) is that large contributions can create the actuality and appearance of corruption of those candidates			1
a candidate who receives a large contribution will feel grateful to the contributor , and legislative policy could well skew in the contributor 's direction			0
well what of the six - and seven - figure donors to @entity9 supporting federal candidates ? federal officeholders are likely to feel just as indebted to them			1
and federal officeholders may do the bidding of other wealthy individuals , corporations and labor unions out of fear that they will support the official 's opponents through a @entity2 in the next election if they do n't			1
given the expected vast spending by presidential candidates and parties in the general election , i am not very concerned that @entity2 spending will influence the outcome of the presidential election , though it might			1
i am not even that concerned about @entity2 negative advertising , which can serve to educate the public and mobilize some voters to become more politically engaged			1
but i am concerned that @entity2 spending will influence the outcome of close @entity35 and congressional races			1
and i am greatly concerned that when @entity176 is over and the public will stop hearing about @entity9 , contributions to these groups will skew public policy away from the public interest and toward the interest of the new fat cats of campaign finance , as members of the @entity36 and @entity35 thank their friends and look over their shoulder at potential new enemies			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity189 .			0

@entity189 : @entity9 have emerged in a big way as funders of campaign ads
he says @entity82 ruling opened the door to special - interest spending
@entity9 can influence voters and put legislators in their debt , he says
@entity189 : danger is that , after election , *lawmakers* will back causes of @entity2 funders
