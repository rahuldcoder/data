@entity1 , @entity0 -- the ruins of @entity4 sit high on a mountain peak with a seemingly never - ending vista looking out over deep gorges , charcoal - gray cliffs and mountain streams			1
it 's a natural paradise , but we did not make the trip to this castle just for the awesome view			2
visitors come for its connection to history 's most famous vampire , @entity20			1
the famous book and the ensuing movies are fiction , but since @entity25 published his novel in 1897 , the world has been looking to @entity27 ( in modern central @entity0 ) as " @entity20 's " home			1
and there is a bit of truth to it			2
@entity25 never visited @entity33 , but his famous character is based , in part , on a real 15th - century prince			1
@entity37 lived from 1431 to about 1476 and ruled @entity38 , which was actually south of @entity27			1
as military leader , he was a hero to his people , and he has a place in the @entity43			1
another museum explains the name " @entity20 " is actually a title from the knightly order of the dragon , whose mission was to defend @entity51			0
documents he signed " @entity37 " still exist			1
a nickname often associated with him is @entity37 , which means impaler , and comes from his brutal application of capital punishment by skewering bodies on a wooden spike			1
visiting @entity20 's castle @entity4 is not on the main tourist route			1
in fact , it 's pretty hard to get there			0
public transportation is infrequent , and the big tourist town in the region , @entity1 , is hours away			0
the woman running our hostel found a friend to drive three of us for 40 euros each ( about $ 55 @entity71 )			2
our guide for the excursion was @entity74 , a 20 - year - old bar tender and @entity1 native			2
we piled into his tiny red @entity77 for the nearly three hour drive			0
he carefully speed around hairpin curves , over mountain passes and through farmland that looked like time stood still			0
farmers drove horses pulling wooden carts , hay stacks were piled ( by hand ) outside farmhouses and cows occasionally wandered into our path			0
in places , the roads were so bad that @entity74 had to drive on the wrong side of the road to avoid potholes that looked like they might swallow the car			0
when we arrived at a communist - era hydroelectric plant , we had to abandon the @entity77 and climb the final distance to @entity4 on foot			1
rigorous journey the signs warn it is 1480 concrete steps straight up			0
i ca n't imagine an army hoping to take the castle			0
it 's hard enough taking the modern stairs			0
the castle entrance is guarded by a single keeper who speaks almost no @entity113			0
the entrance fee is 5 @entity43 lei ( less than $ 2 @entity71 )			0
signs in @entity113 and @entity43 explain @entity37 expanded the castle in 1457			1
legend has it he captured the residents of an enemy town and forced them to build the castle as punishment			0
the structure was never huge , but now all that 's left is ruined walls about one - story high			2
as you walk through the citadel , you can get a feel for how @entity37 and his garrisons peered out over the valleys below looking for enemies			1
despite its rather well - accepted connection to @entity37 , the castle is anything but a tourist trap			1
we only saw two other people on the beautiful fall day we visited			0
this is not the place to buy @entity20 t - shirts			2
in fact , the only souvenirs we found were the few postcards the castle keeper offered for sale			2
dracula a hero ? most @entity0 see @entity37 as a bit of a hero , not the evil demon of " count dracula " fame			1
as he drove us to @entity154 , @entity74 told us " he was our leader			2
... he does not deserve this reputation			0
" in the @entity159 , brutal punishment and executions , including those like @entity37 carried out were common			1
in fact , one museum suggested @entity37 is more of a @entity163 character , " merciless with the rich ones that were violating the law , but at the same time , a reliable friend of the poor			1
for the peasants of @entity38 he was the national hero that served their cause			0
" @entity20 's more convenient castle ? despite a rather tenuous connection with the historic @entity20 , the place tourists seem to flock to seek out the vampire is @entity174			1
still intact , sitting on a cliff with towers and sporting secret staircases , it just looks like it should have a spooky vampire inside			2
and that 's what the touts outside are banking on			0
before you even get to the gate , venders are lined up hawking t - shirts , " @entity187 " and @entity189 - shaped coffee mugs			2
@entity37 's armies passed through when fighting in the area , but the museum points out there is little evidence he spent time here			1
the displays inside the castle are primarily devoted to the @entity43 royal family , who used it as a residence in the first part of the 20th century , though one room does recount the history of the legend of @entity20 , including bios of @entity25 and @entity37			1
this left one young tourist confused			0
she stopped me , asked whether i spoke @entity113 , and asked in all seriousness " do you know where @entity20 's bedroom is ? " @entity174 is less than an hour outside of @entity1			1
it 's on a main road , and the public bus is 8 lei ( less than $ 3 @entity71 ) round trip			0
entry is 20 lei ( less than $ 7 @entity71 ) .			0

ruins of @entity4 can be found in a *rugged* , *isolated* area of @entity0
15th - century leader @entity37 lived here , and tourists are sparse
more tourists go to @entity174 , which is intact but had little connection with @entity37
