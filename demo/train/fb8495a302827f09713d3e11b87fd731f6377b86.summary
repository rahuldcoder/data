-- @entity1 was considered a sport of the capitalist elite and banned in @entity4 under the rule of communist regimes -- but in the 20 years since the @entity8 has fallen there has been a renaissance of the game in the region			1
@entity12 has overseen the development of two courses on the @entity16 coast in @entity17			1
with rising disposable income and an increasing interest in leisure pursuits , a growing number of courses , more television coverage and availability of @entity28 funds , the future of the industry in @entity4 is bright			2
@entity17 is one country where the sport is on the up			0
eight years ago there were no golf courses but -- to fulfil the increasing domestic demand and as a means to attract tourists to the region -- the country could be set for a boom in golf development			1
@entity40 , vice president of @entity1 , believes that despite there being only 200 registered players in a country whose population is eight million there is set to be an explosion of interest in the sport			0
see @entity0 's @entity49 's report on the development of golf in @entity4			2
Â» " it is an absurdly low figure , but now i believe that there 'll be a switch because we have six nice golf courses , " @entity40 told @entity0			0
" we can already see there is a high increase in interest and it 'll evolve quite quickly			0
" we have some advantages in @entity17			0
we have an excellent coastlines , we are a small country but very diverse , so the country is geographically and naturally perfect for golf			0
" the potential in @entity4 has also been recognized by golf legend @entity12 , whose course design company has been working on projects in the region			1
having just opened a course in @entity72 , @entity12 's design company is building two more in @entity17 - @entity73 which is already open , and @entity74 which is scheduled to be finished by july 2010			1
@entity12 told @entity0 : " you want to take golf to new areas , like @entity72 , you want to bring it to @entity17 , where people never thought that they could play golf where people associated golf with just rich people			2
" you can play down here along the ocean and ten minutes up the mountain you have a links course , which is the complete opposite , people who love golf will be in for a golfing treat			0
" the knock - on effect of the presence of a high - profile name such as @entity12 in the region ensures it has caught the eye of influential figures within the industry			2
@entity96 , director of marketing at @entity97 added : " @entity4 is coming along , although there is still not the number of golfers or golf courses that we have in @entity104 , looking to the future it is a great opportunity for us			1
