-- not knowing exactly where my ancestors come from has always bothered me			0
i know my grandparents were born in the @entity4 and believe my great - grandparents were too , but beyond that my family tree is pretty bare			1
adding some leaves and figuring out my family 's origins have been on my life " to do " list for a few decades now and while i still need to do the work , i 'm heartened to learn a little bit more about the cousins i never knew i had			2
you see , i 'm related to president @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , and even my fellow @entity0 colleague @entity20 , co-host of " @entity21			1
" really , i am			0
the credit for learning about my new - found family connections goes to best - selling author @entity24 , the guy who lived life according to the @entity26 for a year for his book " @entity28 " and tried every imaginable diet and workout for another book , " @entity32			1
" he 's now trying to build a family tree of the entire world ( and stage the world 's biggest family reunion -- more on that later )			1
his inspiration , he says , came from an email from a man who said he was @entity24 ' 12th cousin			1
" i was a little bit creeped out , " @entity24 joked during an interview			2
" but then it turned out he really was			0
he had a family tree of 80,000 people on it			1
" @entity24 , an editor at large for @entity47 and a father of three , said he became obsessed with genealogy , playing around on sites such as @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 , which he says have " megamonster family trees " with millions of people on them			1
he 's also interviewed hundreds of people -- from scientists to genealogists to statisticians -- and is working with hundreds of volunteers to create the world 's family tree and track down his own cousins			1
he learned he 's related to celebrities ( @entity66 , @entity67 ) , current and former presidents ( @entity16 , @entity69 , @entity70 ) , and even a wizard			1
ok , not a real wizard exactly			0
" @entity24 is my cousin , and i 'm his cousin , and we are probably cousins , " said @entity73 of " @entity77 " fame in a video for @entity24 ' project			2
( @entity81 note : if my daughters learn we 're related to " @entity77 , " they will fully expect an invitation to @entity86 ! ) ( to find out who you are related to , head to @entity90 and try to have the names and approximate birth dates of your grandparents and the names of any semi-famous relatives and ancestors handy ! ) @entity24 likes to show how some of the people you would never imagine are related actually are			1
for example , he points to @entity16 and his 44 cousins in the @entity102 , including @entity103 sen. @entity103 , one of the biggest critics in the @entity105 of the @entity16 administration			1
@entity103 is actually the husband of the president 's 14th cousin once removed			1
" wonder how they 'll take the news ? " i asked @entity24			2
" i 'm hoping it would nudge people to be a little more open - minded , " he said , admitting to being slightly idealistic			0
" i do n't think it 's going to cause world peace to break out , but i think it will help			2
" now will the @entity118 invite the @entity119 for @entity121 dinner ? and will they invite my family since we are related to the @entity118 , too ? " i just love the fact you can take any two people , any two people on the street ... and see how they 're related , " said @entity24 , declining to speculate on whether we 'll actually get a holiday invitation from the first family			1
" and it drives home this extraordinary fact that we all do come from the same ancestors			0
" " we are all one big family			0
" in that spirit , @entity24 is planning what he calls a @entity137 for june 6 , 2015 , in @entity138			1
tell your first and second and third cousins and beyond , because @entity24 is trying to break the @entity141 when it comes to family reunions			1
the current record is 4,514 , he said			0
" i 'm shooting for at least 5,000 at my family reunion			0
" i asked @entity24 if he 's worried that the current record holder , a family in @entity149 , might get wind of his project and try to top it			1
" listen i am very inclusive			0
i welcome the competition , " he said			0
" i want my reunion to have satellite reunions around the world			2
maybe they can have their reunion at the same time			0
i 've got to give them a call			0
" @entity24 ' effort to hold the largest family reunion ever will be the subject of a book he 's writing			1
the documentary filmmaker @entity165 , host of @entity0 's ' " @entity166 , " is also making a movie about it			0
all proceeds from the @entity137 will go to fight @entity170 's , a disease that " affects 60 million members of the human family , " he said			1
there is one downside to the " we are all related " concept , he conceded			0
let 's just say it can get uncomfortable at times , such as when you marry your cousin			0
" it did happen to me , " said @entity24			2
he and his wife did dna testing using the site @entity188 and learned they are cousins -- not second or third cousins but distant cousins nonetheless			0
" i think it adds a little spice to the marriage , " said @entity24 with a smile , which seemed to imply that i might stop laughing once he told me more			2
" i am sorry to say you are married to your cousin as well , " he said			0
" you married your cousin , so did everybody watching			0
" oh my ! would you attend the @entity137 ? tell @entity200 on @entity201 or @entity202 on @entity203 .			2

best - selling author @entity24 is trying to build a family tree of the entire world
he can show president @entity16 is related to 44 @entity4 senators , including @entity103 @entity103
@entity24 hopes to hold a @entity137 in june 2015
his goal is to break the @entity141 for family reunions
