@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 is not a god , but that does n't stop millions of @entity0 worshipping him			1
since his first professional fight at 16 , @entity3 has amassed a formidable professional record of 54 - 5 - 2			1
he is arguably the most famous person in the country 's history , a world title holder 10 times over and the first person to earn belts in eight separate weight divisions , and in 2012 was one of the highest paid athletes on earth , earning upwards of $ 62 million , more than @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14			2
in addition , he is an actor , tv host and singer			2
oh , and in 2010 , voters also elected @entity3 to the @entity0 ' @entity26 , where he serves the district of @entity28			1
@entity3 's story reads something closer to fable than fact			1
the man who earned the title " @entity3 " in the 2000s by the @entity36 ( @entity36 ) , comes from the humblest of roots			1
born in 1978 in a small village called @entity40 , @entity3 lived with his mother and five brothers and sisters : " when i was young my parents were jobless			1
sometimes we ca n't even afford to have a single meal a day , " says @entity3			1
" when you see my slippers , one is green , one is red			2
i would walk the streets to sell , that 's how i made my living as a kid			2
i felt sorry for my mother			2
i wanted so badly to study			2
i stopped though and pursued boxing			1
" at 14 , @entity3 moved to @entity1 where he says he lived for a time under a cardboard box in a city park			1
he found work as a servant for a rich man			1
luckily , he was treated well , he says			2
when he began boxing as a teenager , he admits having to put rocks in his pockets to make the minimum weight of 105 pounds ( 47kg )			1
when he was 16 , @entity3 decided to pursue a professional boxing career			1
at 4 @entity70 '' and weighing 98 pounds , it 's unlikely he struck much fear in those early opponents			2

@entity3 won the fight by technical knockout to win the title , his second major boxing world title			1
ten years later , i 'm standing in the middle of the @entity88 's casino			2
" do you want to meet him ? " the question came across the table from a documentary film producer , who was profiling @entity3			1
it was may 6 , 2011 , the night before the champion would defend his @entity96 title against @entity97			2
the @entity98 buzzed with energy , gamblers and partiers just getting started as it neared midnight			2
of course , i said yes			0
as we got off the elevator and walked down the hallway to his penthouse suite , i had the same feeling you might get when entering a special , reverential space			0
two bodyguards flanked the door			0
they recognized my friend and let us pass			0
i had expected a reverential , ascetic scene			0
a peaceful room dotted with his family and close friends speaking in hush tones , careful not to disturb their leader as he prepared to do battle in less than 24 hours			0
what i found instead was a mob			0
at least 100 people had packed into his hotel room			1
most were @entity0 well - wishers			0
as we tried to make our way in , someone told us @entity3 and his wife , @entity130 , had retreated to the bedroom			1
we left , but i was n't disappointed			0
i figured i would soon get to know him well in @entity1			0
that night i had drinks with his security guard			0
i wanted to get to know the man i would be covering			0
i wanted to hear what he was like from a person who was often closest to him , his bodyguard , in an unguarded moment			0
" @entity3 is a very nice guy			1
very good to the people around him			1
he believes he is here for a purpose			0
that his rise means he has a responsibility to take his position and do something good with it			0
" @entity3 won the fight easily			1
i watched it from the media room			0
afterwards , @entity3 felt good enough to perform a concert at the @entity149 across from the @entity150			1
he said : " i consider my experience in life as an advantage in all that i do			0
i was down there and i have made my way up here now			0
i have experienced it all			0
i was trained through all the hardships of life , so i feel the pain of the poor			0
" in 2010 , shortly after being elected as a congressman from @entity28 district , he had given a speech in which he argued the country must do more to organize and fund the efforts of anti-trafficking agencies			1
immediately , he began working with the @entity167 , at the time , the largest anti-trafficking charity in the country			1
" i think @entity3 is a very important milestone in our fight against human trafficking here in the @entity0 because young people actually believe and listen to @entity3 , " says @entity170 , executive director of the @entity167 , a charity founded in 1991 to help victims of domestic servitude and forced prostitution			1
" he 's a hard - working guy , he came from a very poor family			0
he inspires a lot of people			2
of course , everybody wants @entity3 in their own campaign , but i 'm happy @entity3 is joining our fight			1
" click here to get full infographic on human trafficking in the @entity0 @entity3 arrived at the @entity167 headquarters to hear first - hand from girls who had been victimized			1
he spoke to three rescued girls , all under the age of 12			0
they had been forced to perform sexual acts in a video chat room for a number of foreign men			0
some of the men demanded they perform sexual acts with men pulled off the street , drink their own urine and other even more awful acts			0
a man off - camera would force the girl 's compliance			0
" now that i 'm here as a congressman , i know what to do			0
i know what i can do to help people			2
" these traffickers have now been warned			0
we just need to be vigilant in order to sustain this			0
we also need funding from @entity220			0
in addition , we need close coordination between government agencies			0
likewise , we need coordination within various local governments , " said @entity224			0
read how @entity226 was inspired to fight the traffickers in february 2012 , @entity3 delivered a speech to congress in which he outlined the necessity to stop human trafficking			1
" during my visit to the @entity167 i talked to children as young as 9 - years - old who are trafficked for prostitution , " @entity3 told @entity220			1
" as politicians , we need to be true to our words and actions			0
we need to send a clear message ; that @entity0 are not for sale			0
" now more than a year later , the @entity0 is in the midst of an election			0
congressman @entity3 is again on the campaign trail -- this time hoping to parlay his popularity into a victory for his wife , @entity130 , who is running to become vice governor of @entity28 district			1
campaigning with his wife is one step toward life after boxing			2
and rumors of the boxing champ 's own political ambitions push beyond the @entity26			2
now , fresh off his stunning loss to @entity257 , in which he was knocked unconscious and lay face - down for several seconds before being helped to his corner , @entity3 is looking toward his future			1
thirty - four is old for a boxer			2
with more than 60 professional fights under his belt , the fear among those in his circle is that he will stay too long in the game , and do permanent damage to his standing			0
speaking to a @entity2 producer in @entity272 , @entity3 says : " in boxing , i do n't think people will forget me after i retire			1
but i really want people to remember me as a public servant , who is good , who is a champion for the people			1
" less than two months after his loss to @entity257 , @entity3 scored an equally stunning victory			1
on february 13 , 2013 , @entity0 's president @entity282 , signed the @entity284 bill @entity3 had been championing , into law			1
for thousands of vulnerable @entity0 whose lives may be changed or even saved , this @entity3 fight is one whose legacy will last far beyond the ring .			1
