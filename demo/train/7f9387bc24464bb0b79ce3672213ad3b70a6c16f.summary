-- i recently saw video of an interview i 'd done a couple years ago , when i was ginormously pregnant			1
next to @entity4 , i was nine months along , with body parts bloated beyond recognition and heading in directions they normally do n't			2
my breasts were falling to the sides -- why had someone not told me to wear a more effective push - up bra ? -- my face was all puffy			2
i swear , i counted one , two -- no , three -- chins below my overly smoky eye shadow			2
and then there was the belly -- a massive dome of a thing , so immense that @entity4 looked like a wee @entity21 lass beside me			2
@entity22 - on - the - cover - of - @entity23 , no. @entity24 , i was not			2
but then i remembered an odd event that occurred hours after that encounter with @entity4 , long after the eye shadow was wiped off			0
i was in a grocery store checking out avocados when a man approached			0
he was probably in his early 40s , clean - shaven , dressed in a sharp gray suit			0
" congratulations ! " he said , beaming			0
" how far along are you ? " " oh , i 'm due in three weeks , " i replied			0
" you must be excited , " he said			0
i did n't tell him that excitement does n't really register when it takes a forklift and three bodybuilders to raise you out of bed in the morning			0
" is it your first ? " " mmm hmm			0
" ordinarily an exchange like this would wrap up at that point , especially since i 'd found the perfect avocado and was ready to continue shopping			0
however , my curious new friend refused to budge			0
boy or girl ? feeling good ? i was n't sure whether to start lobbing bell peppers and radishes at the guy , or just accept the chatter as that kindness from strangers only pregnancy evokes			1
my instincts told me there was more to it and when pregnant , your instincts are pretty darn noisy			1
there was something behind his charming smile , his lingering and the urgent look in his eyes			0
this dude thought i was hot			0
but how could he ? i mean , i looked like an upright hippopotamus			0
was he merely homing in on the obviousness of my fertility ? did he have a thing for maternity jeans ? how is it possible that when your pregnant self feels your stretched - out worst , you 're able to attract random - dude - in - @entity84 in the fruit and veggie aisle ? but sex educator @entity87 says during pregnancy , it 's possible for women to be at their absolute best , and for others to see that , too			1
" there is something about being pregnant that gives you this sense of confidence being in your own skin , " she says			1
" the idea of having to exercise until you 're blue in the face and be stick skinny and fit into the tiny little things , you kind of think ' this is not that time			0
' and there is something about owning that and owning your body ... and people pick up on that			0
" @entity87 , who wrote the book " how to get your wife to have sex with you , " also points out that a voracious appetite for food when eating for two translates to an appetite for other things -- life in general and , of course , sex			1
it 's no secret that the surge of pregnancy hormones can get a knocked up gal very worked up			1
i 've heard husbands say that sex with their pregnant wives is the best they 'd ever had			1
but that 's within a committed relationship			1
i was taken aback when one of my single guy friends once told me having sex with a pregnant woman was high up on his bucket list			1
what , like climbing @entity136 and going fly - fishing naked ? what 's that about ? i decided to ask my friend @entity139			1
he 's a father of three , and @entity140 -- he tends to be very up - front about sexual matters			1
to my surprise , he admitted that he finds pregnant women attractive			1
and it all starts with " the glow			0
" " as banal as it may seem , it does have something to do with the light , " he says			0
" among other nonpregnant ladies , a pregnant woman does shine			1
which , if you think about it , is technically absurd , since often enough the glow comes along with visible signs of fatigue and pimples			0
and spatula - flinging outbursts of rage			0
" another more obvious aspect is the boobs , " @entity139 said			0
" but that only applies to women one already knows well enough to notice the change			1
breasts get bigger during pregnancy , transforming even the smallest - chested woman into @entity172			1
but it was this next comment from @entity139 that really got me thinking : " a pregnant woman always brings out an odd mix of physical attraction and desire to be protective			1
even when the woman is not carrying his child ? could there be some kind of biological spell at work here ? maybe , says neuropsychiatrist dr. @entity187 , author of " @entity188 " and " @entity189			0
" @entity187 says pheromones given off by a pregnant woman are known to suppress the testosterone levels in her male partner and increase his production of the hormone prolactin			1
these changes might play a role in forming " daddy brain , " a state that keeps the father rooted to the mother so he 'll help care for her and the baby after the birth			0
perhaps , @entity187 suggests , there was something " pheromonal " going on while i was in the grocery store that day			0
( she notes , though , there 's no evidence that pheromones could work so quickly on humans in such a situation			1
) let 's go back to the visuals for a minute , since after all , pregnancy is an astonishingly visual adventure			1
@entity187 says men are wired to scan for the telltale signs that a woman is fertile -- an hourglass figure , breasts and a flat abdomen signaling that she has n't been impregnated by someone else			2
why then are some men sexually attracted to women with a distinctly un-flat abdomen ? " when you 're very pregnant there is this undeniable evidence you have had sex with a man , " @entity187 says			1
" and that can be titillating			0
it 's like wearing a billboard sign on your body : " i ! had ! sex ! " what else a pregnant belly might advertise : i 'm ! safe ! " the male may feel maybe he can flirt with her in some way and have her not take it the wrong way , " @entity187 says			1
" or because she 's already pregnant [ he does n't ] have to worry about contraception			1
these things may not all be conscious in the male who 's leering at you but they may be percolating in the back of his brain somewhere , that you 're a safe target			2
pregnant women reading this are cringing			1
it is a bit " ewwww			0
" sex with your baby daddy , least of all a stranger , might be the last thing on your mind right now , especially if you 've been constipated for eight days and have an overactive bladder			2
so we ca n't forget , there 's also the fetish angle			2
an abundance of pregnancy porn online proves there 's a contingent of the population with a desire for pregnant women that goes beyond mere curiosity			1
( we should remind ourselves that fetishes exist for all kinds of things -- feet , ponytails , penguins ; you name it )			0
@entity187 says some of her patients do express an erotic interest in very pregnant females			2
a study published in @entity290 in 2011 suggests there 's a link between sexual attraction to pregnancy and exposure to pregnancy and lactation in early childhood			1
the study found that a preference for pregnant or breastfeeding women was more common in individuals who had younger siblings ; exposure to a pregnant mother between 18 months and 5 years might leave an imprint that manifests in adulthood			1
but let 's cast aside studies and evolutionary biology and odd bucket lists for a second			2
we might really gain something useful from all this if we home in on @entity87 's idea that a woman has the ability to eschew her usual hang - ups about her body during pregnancy			1
that let - it - all - hang - out easiness			0
in spite of the heft , i almost felt weightless when i was pregnant			2
we are so down on ourselves about our bodies so much of the time and pregnancy shields you from that nonsense ( if you let it			2
) i ate peanut m&ms by the truckload , loved my shapeliness , celebrated the life growing within me by smiling more and stood straighter than ever before -- though it might 've been good posture that prevented me from toppling over			0
" to be this kind of curvaceous superwoman ( while pregnant ) is something that we probably do n't tap into enough , " @entity87 says			2
" and if we could find a way to balance some of those feelings , that confidence in our everyday life , i think we 'd all probably be a bit better off			1
" toward the end of my interview with @entity4 in 2010 , she looked directly at my mountainous belly and said in her delightful @entity21 brogue : " i do n't think i 've ever been interviewed by anyone quite so pregnant ! " i was tickled pink that a pop veteran like @entity4 would acknowledge my determination to keep working even though i was so far into my third trimester , when the pounds and discomfort come fast and furious			2
clearly i did n't mind baring it all for @entity0 's cameras			1
part of me really misses that brazen broad with all her breadth			0
i 'll think of her next time i 'm pinching avocados in the supermarket , and perhaps pinch myself to stand a little straighter , smile a little more and wink at no one in particular .			0

@entity0 's @entity371 remembers men flirting with her while she was pregnant
sex educators say the attraction is not *uncommon*
*experts* say it might be because women find new confidence during pregnancy
another theory : men know pregnant women are able to *reproduce*
