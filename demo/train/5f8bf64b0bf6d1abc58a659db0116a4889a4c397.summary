sometimes geography gets in the way of power politics			0
just when you thought that @entity4 was miles away from @entity5 , bang -- you find out that they 're actually bordering each other			1
confused ? i bet you are			0
but here 's the deal : the civil war in @entity4 , which most sensible people tend to classify these days as a direct stand - off between @entity15 and the @entity16 , is now having a direct impact on the conflict in @entity5			1
the so - called " @entity19 " ( @entity20 ) -- it 's better to keep it in quotation marks and add " so - called , " so as not to give these terrorists legitimacy -- has emerged as a force that has created a so - called caliphate and vows to spread its borders way beyond @entity5 and @entity27 , where it is currently operating			1
@entity15 is supporting president @entity30 's regime in @entity5 , while @entity16 and its allies are backing the anti-government rebels there -- some of whom have at some point developed into @entity20 and started to get all sorts of crazy ideas			1
since it is @entity30 's troops who are actually doing the fighting on the ground against @entity20 and since it so happens that this new menace is now the number one target of @entity16 , it follows that @entity4 is very close to @entity5 when it comes to international power - play			1
this week , out of the blue , the already - disbanded @entity4 parliament voted to provide special status for @entity50 and @entity51 -- the two rebellious regions in eastern @entity4 -- offering them autonomy for three years and allowing them to hold their own elections for their local authorities , in addition to offering an amnesty for people who have not been directly involved in fighting @entity4 government troops			0
initially this was received with caution in @entity65 -- especially given what has been going on for the past nine months in @entity4 -- but if that is not a signal from @entity69 that he is ready to play ball with @entity15 , then i do n't know what is			1
the view in @entity65 is that the @entity73 is telling the @entity74 that it needs help in dealing with @entity20			1
but as it ca n't just say it publicly , it is using @entity4 president @entity78 to do the honors			0
i am told that the initial reaction in the @entity74 to @entity69 's plan to fight @entity20 was not exactly a kind one			1
the suspicion was that @entity84 , together with its allies , was planning to use the campaign against @entity20 in @entity5 to dispose of @entity30 through the back door , so to speak			1
an anti-terrorist operation targeted at @entity20 " gets out of control " and all sorts of wrong targets get hit , like , say , @entity5 army positions			1
one thing leads to another and , lo and behold , we have @entity30 going down the route of @entity97 , and @entity5 descends into the same kind of chaos that is now gripping @entity100			0
but after the " border " between @entity4 and @entity5 emerged all of a sudden , that attitude is changing			2
but the broad @entity105 coalition that @entity69 is hoping to build is not exactly shaping up as planned			0
@entity106 is openly hesitant to get involved , and the @entity107 are not exactly over the moon with the whole concept			0
so @entity69 's best bet to get the ball rolling , as it is now seen from @entity65 , would be to discreetly work with @entity15			2
although it may be tempting for @entity84 to overthrow @entity30 , such a move could backfire on the @entity113 , giving @entity20 a boost instead of a kick and turning those pesky @entity16 midterm elections into a total nightmare for the @entity118			0
( incidentally , @entity15 experts believe that @entity69 will lose the @entity120 and will being to resemble a late - term @entity121 , who improved his golf swing dramatically in his last years in office			0
) so it made sense for @entity84 to wave the white flag -- albeit a very small one -- at the expense of the @entity4 regime in @entity129 , in order to signal to the @entity74 that it is time to do some business together			2
@entity15 president @entity133 has his own plan for @entity5			2
@entity135 , his top diplomat , has made a point of stressing the point that without the @entity5 regime on board , any attempt to defeat @entity20 wo n't work			2
a similar scenario to the one that had been used to prevent the @entity16 bombing @entity5 last year is shaping up nicely in @entity65			2
@entity15 will ask the @entity16 to cooperate with @entity30 in the battle against @entity20 , without the @entity5 president having to fear that he might be bumped off along the way			2
the hawks in @entity84 might not like this script , but hey , stranger things have happened in power politics in the past			0
what will @entity133 ask for in return for helping to defeat @entity20 ? that 's the question that is probably being mulled over in the @entity113 as you read this			0
well , it just so happens that sorting out the mess in eastern @entity4 is @entity133 's personal project -- just like @entity5 was last year			1
he will want some sort of guarantee that @entity129 will stick to the new deal about the special status of @entity50 and @entity51 which should help calm things down in the eastern provinces , at least until next spring			0
that would be a deal that the @entity74 would consider worthwhile			0
but the funniest thing of all is that the " broad coalition " @entity69 proposed may never see the light of day -- and at that point , the only countries that will actually be able to help the @entity16 fight @entity20 would be @entity27 , @entity173 , @entity5 and @entity15 , with the latter mostly providing the weaponry to the @entity5			1
which is not really all that surprising if you consider how closely @entity4 and @entity5 are intertwined			1
