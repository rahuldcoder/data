@entity0 -- a federal judge on wednesday rejected a motion by lawyers for @entity5 to prevent prison doctors from forcibly medicating the @entity8 shooting suspect			1
" i defer to medical judgement , " @entity10 district judge @entity9 said in ruling that prison doctors were within their rights to force @entity5 to take mind - altering psychotropic drugs against his will			1
" i have no reason to disagree with the doctors here			2
" @entity9 , who conducted the hearing in his @entity0 court , also ordered that sensitive medical and legal documents relating to @entity5 's treatment for mental illness remain sealed			0
@entity5 has already started receiving the powerful drugs , wednesday 's hearing revealed			1
lawyers representing @entity5 contend that forcing him to take the drugs against his will violates his rights			1
authorities at the @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity31 , where @entity5 is being held , should have tried lesser restraints such as milder tranquilizers , argued @entity34 , one of @entity5 's lawyers			2
prison authorities " allowed competing objectives to interfere " by ordering the psychotropic drugs , which are for treating mental illness , in an effort to restore @entity5 to mental competency so he can stand trial -- as desired by law enforcement and judicial systems , @entity34 asserted			1
prosecutors responded tuesday that prison officials acted properly in ordering the medication , which they said was necessary for @entity5 to control his mental illness			1
" this is a person who is a ticking time bomb , " proscecutor @entity49 said			0
" he 's lunged at his defense counsel and spits at her			0
" @entity5 , 22 , is charged in the january mass shooting in which six people were killed and 13 wounded , including @entity56 @entity10 rep. @entity55 , in front of a @entity59 grocery story in @entity60 , @entity8			1
a federal judge ruled last month that @entity5 was not competent to stand trial , and he was sent to the federal facility in @entity30			0
@entity9 , at the beginning of wednesday 's hearing , suggested the federal court in @entity31 , where @entity5 is being held , might be where medical decisions should be made			0
" if he had a bad toothache , complained about treatment , would he come to me ? " @entity9 asked			0
in their emergency motion on june 24 to halt the forced medication , @entity5 's lawyers said prison officials held a deficient hearing process and used faulty reasoning in deciding to drug @entity5 against his will			1
for example , @entity5 had no attorney present at the june 14 hearing , the lawyers said in their motion , and officials failed to state the drug and dosage he should receive			0
according to the emergency motion , authorities had earlier assessed @entity5 as dangerous because of incidents before his transfer to the @entity30 prison : he threw a chair against a door and spat at an attorney			0
however , the reasoning by prison officials in @entity30 for deciding to administer the drugs was to treat @entity5 's mental illness , rather than to subdue any dangerous behavior , the motion noted			2
prosecutors argued in their response that @entity5 received a proper administrative hearing on the matter , and the medication prescribed was necessary to prevent him from being a danger to himself and others			2
