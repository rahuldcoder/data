-- suppose that shortly after 9/11 , when it became clear that @entity3 and other members of @entity5 were responsible for the attacks , president @entity1 had made the following announcement : " those responsible for these attacks are cowardly , vicious murderers , and we will pursue them to the ends of the earth to capture them			2
they are not warriors , they are criminals , and they will be treated accordingly			0
and once we catch them , we will bring them back to the @entity14 and put them on trial right there in lower @entity16 so that a jury of 12 fair - minded @entity18 can decide their fate			0
" such an announcement would not have been controversial in the slightest and undoubtedly would have been met with widespread approval			0
after all , putting terrorists on trial in federal court is how we always dealt with terrorists , including the first group of murderers who tried to blow up the @entity29			1
but president @entity1 did n't say that			2
instead , on november 13 , 2001 , he announced that those responsible would be tried in military commissions , and declared that " it is not practicable to apply in military commissions			1
the principles of law and the rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the @entity14 district courts			1
" like many @entity14 , i did not adequately consider the implications of that statement at the time			0
more of us should have challenged the president to explain why it was impracticable to apply regular principles of law and rules of evidence to these criminal suspects			2
in hindsight , it appears likely that the president 's real concern was that he knew he had authorized the @entity55 to detain suspected terrorists in secret prisons and subject them to harsh interrogation methods			1
those grossly abusive techniques would taint potential statements and pose a challenge for future criminal trials			0
whatever his motivations , the president 's decision to jettison the civilian courts in favor of military commissions was a grave misjudgment that diminished our stature in the world and ultimately accomplished nothing			1
as i witnessed as a military defense lawyer at @entity77 , the military commissions of the @entity1 administration were , indisputably , a catastrophic failure			1
not a single person responsible for any major terrorist attack was tried			0
the countless millions of dollars and man - hours devoted to the commissions yielded only three convictions of minor figures , two -- @entity85 and @entity86 -- who received token sentences and were then released			2
neither of these defendants was convicted of a traditional war crime , but of providing material support to terrorism , a crime more appropriately tried in federal court			1
since 9/11 , many @entity14 have been tried and convicted of this same offense in federal court and received considerably longer sentences than @entity85 or @entity86			1
the third detainee who was convicted , @entity100 ( whom i was assigned to represent but who refused to be defended ) , received a life sentence			0
having sat through the trial , i 'm quite confident the prosecutors could have achieved the same outcome in federal court			0
the convictions of @entity86 and @entity108 are now on appeal			0
because of the many flaws in the law and procedures under which these men were tried , it is by no means certain that their convictions will be upheld			0
in november 2009 , attorney general @entity117 made the decision that president @entity1 should have made eight years earlier , announcing that the 9/11 suspects would be tried in federal district court			2
this was more than just a symbolic repudiation of @entity1 era policies -- after eight years of failed efforts to prosecute the men in military commissions , during which hundreds of other terrorists had been tried and convicted in federal court , it was the only logical choice			1
unfortunately , @entity117 also announced that other detainees would be tried in military commissions , creating a two - tiered system of justice			1
so far , the attorney general has failed to offer any principled basis for which defendants are sent to which forum , leaving many with the disturbing impression that the decisions are based on political , rather than legal , considerations			0
the latest news reports suggesting the administration is close to reversing itself has only reinforced this view			0
it 's true that the @entity146 of 2009 , the third version of the military tribunals , is a substantial improvement over the previous version of the law , which has hastily passed in 2006 in response to the @entity154 's ruling that the original military commissions created by executive order were unconstitutional			1
indeed , " the principles of law and rules of evidence " that generally apply in @entity14 criminal courts now largely apply to military commissions , ironically proving false president @entity1 's original justification for the creation of the military commissions -- the alleged impracticability of applying such principles and rules			1
yet , even with improvements , the commissions are still a completely untested criminal justice system			0
the implementing regulations for the new law have yet to be published			0
the secretary of defense has failed to appoint a new @entity176 or a new chief defense counsel for the military commissions			1
the first hearings under this law have been plagued by confusion and delay , and there 's every reason to believe that will continue			2
how much longer should the families of the 9/11 victims have to wait for justice ? perhaps there are sound practical and logistical reasons why the 9/11 trial should not take place in lower @entity16 ; that is debatable			0
but there are no valid reasons why the 9/11 trial should not take place in a federal court under federal law			1
let 's show the world what distinguishes @entity14 from our enemies : our reverence for the rule of law and our respect for human rights and due process , even for those we despise			1
let the alleged 9/11 co-conspirators have their day in court under fair , time - tested and internationally accepted laws , rules and procedures			2
if they are guilty of the appalling crimes of which they are accused , the capable prosecutors of the @entity215 ( who have far more experience than their military counterparts ) will prove it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity223 .			2

@entity226 administration now *reconsidering* trying 9/11 defendants in court
former military defense lawyer @entity223 says terrorists have long been tried in court
military commissions do n't have the courts ' long record of achievement , he says
@entity223 : let 's show the world our " reverence for the rule of law "
