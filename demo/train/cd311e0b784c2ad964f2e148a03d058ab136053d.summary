" @entity17 said the progress report recommended an updated strategy in @entity10 to the @entity41			2
he told lawmakers that the departments said they will " review and refine the current strategy as necessary , but asserted that ' @entity29 ' remains valid			0
" @entity17 also argued that a renewed strategy is important " for several reasons			0
" the goals and objectives for the present phase end this month and they are " contained in disparate documents rather than a single strategic plan , " he said in his prepared remarks			0
" much has changed in @entity10 since january 2007 , when the president announced ' @entity29			0
' violence is down , @entity4 surge forces are leaving , and a new framework for the @entity4 presence in @entity10 needs to be agreed upon beyond the @entity60 mandate , " @entity17 said			2

" the agency noted that not all of the country 's provinces have lead responsibility for security and less than 10 percent of @entity10 security forces " were at the highest readiness level			2
" the progress report also cited the enactment by @entity10 lawmakers of measures " to return some @entity77 to government , grant amnesty to detained @entity10 and define provincial powers			2

as for the economic arena , crude oil production is below @entity4 goals , even though it has " improved for short periods , " the @entity3 report said			1

" @entity17 said the @entity118 , @entity119 and other agencies should " develop an updated strategy for @entity10 that defines @entity4 goals and objectives after july 2008			1
