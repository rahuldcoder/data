@entity0 -- the @entity6 has backed an @entity8 law that punishes businesses hiring illegal immigrants , a law that opponents , including the @entity4 administration , say steps on traditional federal oversight over immigration matters			1
the 5 - 3 ruling thursday is a victory for supporters of immigration reform on the state level			1
it was the first high court challenge to a variety of recent state laws cracking down on illegal immigrants , an issue that has become a political lightning rod			1
the outcome could serve as a judicial warmup for a separate high - profile challenge to a more controversial @entity8 immigration reform law working its way through lower courts			1
that statute would , among other things , give local police a greater role in arresting suspected illegal immigrants			0
the hiring case turned on whether state law tramples on federal authority			1
" @entity8 has taken the route least likely to cause tension with federal law , " wrote chief justice @entity38			1
" it relies solely on the federal government 's own determination of who is an unauthorized alien , and it requires @entity8 employers to use the federal government 's own system for checking employee status			1
" @entity8 passed the @entity50 in 2007 , allowing the state to suspend the licenses of businesses that " intentionally or knowingly " violate work - eligibility verification requirements			1
companies would be required under that law to use @entity57 , a federal database to check the documentation of current and prospective employees			2
that database had been created by @entity61 as a voluntary , discretionary resource			0
the @entity64 @entity63 filed a lawsuit against the state , arguing that federal law prohibits @entity8 and other states from making e-verify use mandatory			1
the group was supported by a variety of civil rights and immigration rights groups			0
the state countered that its broad licensing authority gives it the right to monitor businesses within its jurisdiction			2
the @entity4 administration recommended a judicial review and sided with businesses and civil rights groups			0
a 1986 federal act significantly limited state power to separately regulate the hiring and employment of " unauthorized " workers			2
an exception was made for local " licensing and similar laws			0
" under the law , employees are required to review documentation to confirm someone 's right to work in the @entity64 , including checking the familiar i - 9 immigration form			2
@entity96 and criminal penalties were strengthened , but businesses making a " good faith " effort to comply with i - 9 procedures were generally immune from prosecution			2
@entity38 , backed by his four conservative colleagues , said , " @entity8 went the extra mile in ensuring that its law tracks ( the federal law 's ) provisions in all material aspects			1
" in dissent , justice @entity109 noted @entity57 is a voluntary program and said criticism that the federal government is not doing enough to enforce the law is irrelevant			0
" permitting states to make use of @entity57 mandatory improperly puts states in the position of making decisions ... that directly affect expenditure and depletion of federal resources , " she wrote			0
justices @entity123 and @entity125 also dissented			0
justice @entity126 did not participate in the case , since she had been the administration 's solicitor general last year when the case was being appealed to the high court			1
gov. @entity131 had backed the law , saying in december when the case was argued , " the bottom line is that we believe that if the ( federal ) government is n't going to do the job , then @entity8 is going to do the job			1
we are faced with a crisis			0
" this case could serve as a bellwether to how the court will view a larger , more controversial state immigration law from @entity8			1
much of that statute was tossed out by a federal judge in august and is pending at a federal appeals court			0
it would , among other things , give police authority to check a person 's immigration status if officers have a " reasonable suspicion " that the individual is in the country illegally			0
one human rights group , the @entity155 of @entity156 , called the ruling dangerous because it could promote anti-immigrant atmosphere			0
" @entity8 's residents and businesses have suffered enough in the wake of unnecessary immigration enforcement legislation , " @entity159 , executive director of @entity155 , said			2
" this decision will only exacerbate those struggles , as it could be misinterpreted by @entity8 politicians with unwarranted anti-immigrant agendas as a license to enact measures that increase bureaucracy , slow down business operations and erode the civil rights of job seekers , who could now be denied an employment opportunity because of their last name , " she said			0
@entity1 's @entity177 contributed to this report .			0
