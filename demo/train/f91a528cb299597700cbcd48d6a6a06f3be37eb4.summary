-- the @entity2 government is being asked to update its 16 - year - old cell phone radiation standard to bring it in line with current research and the way people use smartphones			1
a new @entity10 report on wednesday asked the @entity11 to consider updating the standard , which limits the amount of radiation a phone emits			1
the report recommended following an international standard , which would allow @entity2 cell phones to emit up to 20 % more radiation than currently allowed			1
the @entity10 also asked the @entity11 to consider updating its cell phone testing procedures to account for phones being used while next to the body -- such as in a pocket or held in your hand -- rather than only testing how phones emit radiation when held up to your ear			1
more tech : be careful when diagnosing your ailments online while people still often use cell phones for talking , these devices have evolved into small portable computers and multipurpose tools			2
it 's now common to see people using cell phones as media players kept in a pocket and used with earbuds or a wireless headset , or held in the hand while checking @entity44 or getting directions from @entity46			2
" current testing requirements for mobile phones may not identify the maximum radio frequency ( @entity52 ) energy exposure when tested against the body , " said the report			0
" @entity11 testing requirements state that mobile phone tests should be conducted with belt - clips and holsters attached to the phone or at a predetermined distance from the body			2
" by testing mobile phones only when at a distance from the body , @entity11 may not be identifying the maximum exposure , since some users may hold a mobile phone directly against the body while in use			1
" the @entity11 allows cell phones and other wireless devices to emit up to 1.6 watts per kilogram , averaged over 1 gram of tissue			1
that 's the maximum specific absorption rate ( @entity73 ) , a measurement of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed into the body -- information that phone manufacturers must provide to @entity2 consumers			0
@entity11 developed this limit back in 1996 , based on input from several federal health and safety agencies			0
a decade after the @entity11 published that standard , the @entity84 , a global organization that sets standards for electrical devices , published its own recommendation for a maximum @entity73			0
more tech : @entity89 urged online to ' make a baby ' thursday since then the @entity11 's lower limit has remained in force , which complicates matters for phone manufacturers and may increase costs to consumers			0
the @entity10 noted : " maintaining the current @entity2 limit may result in additional costs for manufacturers and impact phone design in a way that could limit performance and functionality			2
" to comply with the @entity11 's limit , some manufacturers also may have to disable features on phones sold in the @entity2 , according to the @entity10			1
some consumer groups told the @entity10 they do n't think the info provided by federal agency websites about mobile phone health effects is sufficiently precautionary			0
also , some said they 'd like the @entity11 website to mention the @entity115 's controversial reclassification last year of radio frequency energy exposure as " possibly carcinogenic			0
" the @entity10 looked into the issue of revisiting cell phone radiation standards at the request of three high - ranking congressional democrats : @entity121 of @entity122 and @entity123 and @entity124 of @entity125			1

the @entity11 is asked wednesday to consider updating its cell phone radiation standard
the new standard would allow @entity2 cell phones to emit up to 20 % more radiation
the question was presented to the @entity11 in a new @entity10 report
it also asked the @entity11 to test for cell phones being used next to the body , not just at the ear
