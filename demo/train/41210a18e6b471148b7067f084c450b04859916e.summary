the chairman of the @entity1 , gen. @entity0 , left the door open thursday to stepped - up @entity4 military involvement in @entity5 if @entity7 militants pose a threat to the @entity4			1

" assessing and advising and enabling are very different words than attacking , defeating and disrupting , " he said during a briefing at the @entity18 in @entity19			0
" we may get to that point if our national interests drive us there , if ( the @entity25 in @entity5 and @entity26 ) becomes such a threat to the homeland that the @entity29 , with our advice , decides that we have to take direct action			2
