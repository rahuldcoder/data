-- what 's on tap for you and your partner this @entity5 ? a romantic dinner , a box of chocolates , maybe a bouquet of roses ? while all those gestures are thoughtful , the results of a new survey led by sex and relationships researcher @entity13 and the experts at @entity16 suggest that most couples have something a little more intimate in mind			1
in fact , nearly 85 % of men and women report that sex is an important part of @entity5 , and 50 % say that they 'll be disappointed if they do n't get lucky on the 14th			1
" @entity5 is second only to @entity29 in the most celebrated holidays worldwide , " explains @entity28			1
" yet only a small amount of scientific literature has been dedicated to the attitudes , perceptions and participation in @entity5 celebrations			1
" to learn more about the way both couples and single people feel about the holiday , @entity28 and her colleagues polled more than 2,000 men and women between age 18 and 70 , 66 % of whom were in long - term committed relationships			0
" the results , " says @entity28 , " give us insight into specific plans and expectations around this holiday			0
" the overwhelming majority of men and women are expecting sex			1
here 's how to make intimacy the centerpiece of your relationship this @entity5			1
our survey found that 65 % of respondents plan on being affectionate on february 14 -- and affection does n't always have to be sexual			1
build anticipation before the big day ( and night ) by exchanging a few sexy texts or e-mails with your partner			0
steal a kiss or two			0
you can also foster intimacy by giving him or her a really long hug : research shows that hugging each other for at least 20 to 30 seconds can trigger the flow of oxytocin , the so - called feel - good " cuddle hormone "			2
great sex does n't always just happen			1
sometimes , it takes a little planning , especially if -- like many @entity87 -- you 've been in a bit of a sex rut			2
do some prep work by turning your bedroom into a love nest : make the bed ( with new , or at least clean , sheets ) , tidy up , light a candle or two , and queue up a sexy playlist on your @entity97			2
if you do go out to dinner , do n't overindulge , and hit the sack early so you 're not too tired for intimacy			2
think outside the chocolate box			0
while flowers , chocolate and lingerie still top the list in gifts , 30 % of people plan on a more specifically sex - oriented gift on @entity5 , says @entity28			1
these days , sensual presents and sex toys are as close as your local drugstore and can often be found right next to the condoms			2
if you 're in the market for a higher - end present , consider a new vibrating toy that charges in your laptop 's usb port			0
or gift your partner an anthology of erotica , and read a few stories together			0
according to the survey , 55 % of both men and women are open to trying something new sexually , just because it 's @entity5			1
take this opportunity to talk with your partner about stepping outside your comfort zones a bit			0
maybe you want to experiment with role - playing , or watch an erotic movie together , or try a new position			0
feeling shy ? take a tip from psychoanalyst @entity135 , who suggests couples create a " sexual menu " that features a variety of sensual activities -- anything from watching the sunset together to giving each other erotic massages to acting out a fantasy			2
you can write up your menus independently and then share them on the big night			0
@entity5 should be about celebrating love , but you do n't have to be in a romantic relationship to enjoy it			1
resist the urge to be impulsive , like 40 % of survey participants who say they would hook up with someone sexually just because of the holiday			0
" i advise some of my clients feeling anxious about the holiday to get together with people they love , like close friends or family members , with whom they have formed positive and supportive relationships , " advises psychotherapist @entity154			0
that could mean dinner with friends , visiting your parents , or , if you 're a single mom or dad , celebrating with your kids			0
@entity5 is a great opportunity to get closer to the one you love			2
use it to jumpstart your relationship , but remember : you do n't need a reason to celebrate love and intimacy every day of the year .			1

a majority of survey respondents say they expect sex on @entity5
to make intimacy a centerpiece , start outside the bedroom
get creative -- it may be time to try something new
remember intimacy does n't always have to be about sex
