a @entity11 official said it 's " clear " that @entity4 government forces were involved in the massacre , which left more than 100 people dead , nearly half of them children			1
a " fairly small number appear to have been killed by shelling , artillery and tank fire which took place over a period of more than 12 hours , " said @entity18 , a spokesman for the @entity11 human rights office			0
should the @entity2 ' airdrop ' millions of phones into @entity4 ? the majority appear to have died as a result of " summary executions " by " armed men going into houses and killing men , women and children inside , " he said			1
" what is clear is government forces were involved			0
they were shelling , using tanks and artillery			0
and it appears to be @entity44 militia ( a government militia group ) , entering houses and slaughtering people in what is really an abominable crime that took place throughout the day on friday			1
" @entity4 has denied being behind the killings , insisting that " terrorists " carried them out			2
@entity4 officials said the government would investigate			2
the bloodshed continued tuesday , when at least 72 people were killed across the country , including nine children and two women , the opposition @entity56 said			1
@entity4 said 21 " army and law enforcement martyrs " were buried			1
children shot , knifed , axed to death in @entity4 's @entity9 massacre , reports say the @entity68 , the @entity2 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 all announced tuesday that they were expelling some @entity4 diplomats			1
in some cases , it was just the ambassadors ; in others , numerous diplomats were expelled			0
the @entity85 decided to expel the @entity4 charge d'affaires , two @entity85 officials told @entity0			2
@entity87 was called to the department tuesday morning and told he and his family had 72 hours to leave			2
he has been the top @entity4 envoy in the @entity2 since the ambassador , @entity90 , was called back to @entity4 in october in a response move after the @entity2 said it was pulling its ambassador out of @entity4			1
" we hold the @entity4 government responsible for this slaughter of innocent lives , " @entity85 spokeswoman @entity93 said in a statement tuesday			1
" this massacre is the most unambiguous indictment to date of the @entity4 government 's flagrant violations of its @entity104 obligations ... along with the regime 's ongoing threat to peace and security			1
" @entity110 spokesman @entity109 was even more emphatic			0
" this weekend 's massacre is a horrifying testament to this regime 's depravity			0
the international community is united in its revulsion at the regime 's actions through both its military and its thug forces , and we are ratcheting up the pressure on and isolation of this murderous regime , " he said			0
sen. @entity126 , @entity69 's minister for foreign affairs , said in a statement , " the @entity4 government can expect no further official engagement with @entity69 until it abides by the @entity11 cease - fire and takes active steps to implement the peace plan agreed with joint special envoy @entity133			1
" the @entity74 @entity134 said it was declaring the ambassador persona non grata and expelling four other diplomats " for the unacceptable repression carried out by the @entity4 regime on its population			1
" but @entity133 , envoy for the @entity11 and the @entity141 , took a markedly different tone after meeting with @entity4 president @entity143			1
while he said he " conveyed in frank terms the grave concern of the international community about the violence in @entity4 , including the recent shocking events in @entity9 , " he also said that @entity4 's vow to organize its own investigations " is very encouraging			2
" he also said he " expressed appreciation for the cooperation of the @entity4 government , which enabled the @entity11 to deploy an observer mission to @entity4 , quickly			2
" " we are at a tipping point			0
the @entity4 people do not want the future to be one of bloodshed and division			1
yet the killings continue and the abuses are still with us today , " @entity133 said , according to a statement released by his office			2
he said he appealed to @entity143 " for bold steps now -- not tomorrow , now -- to create momentum for the implementation of the plan			0
" " i also appeal to the armed opposition to cease acts of violence , " he added			0
talking to reporters in @entity173 , @entity133 was asked what he thought would happen in @entity4 if the peace plan was not implemented			1
" if the plan is not implemented , i would worry for the future of @entity4			1
i would worry about stability in the country			0
... if we do not ( implement the plan ) , may @entity180 help us , " he said			1
" words are wonderful , but action is better			0
what is important is demonstrate through action a real commitment to the plan and this is what the international community is asking for now : action , not words , " he said			0
@entity195 told @entity133 that " terrorist groups " have escalated operations , including killings and kidnappings , in recent days , and he stressed the urgency of getting countries that are " financing and harboring terrorist groups " to commit to @entity133 's plan , @entity4 state - run tv reported			1
residents in @entity9 say @entity4 regime forces terrorized the town , a suburb of the anti-government bastion of @entity210			1
an 11 - year - old survivor recalled his experience			0
" they were talking to my mom			0
i 'm not sure what happened but they shot her five times			0
they shot her in the head			0
then he turned and shot my sister , @entity222 , in the head			0
then he shot my brother , @entity225 , in the neck and back , " the boy said			0
' @entity229 , ' @entity228 help amplify voices in @entity4 months of diplomatic efforts and economic sanctions have yet to quash the violence , and anger over perceived inaction by world leaders boiled over after the @entity9 massacre , which the @entity11 said left 108 people dead			1
opinion : only @entity241 , @entity240 can stop carnage in @entity4 horrific images of dozens of mutilated children 's corpses in @entity9 prompted a rare moment of unity sunday from the @entity104			2
even @entity241 , the staunchest defender of the @entity4 regime on the council , signed on to a statement that condemned the @entity4 government for its " outrageous use of force against ( the ) civilian population			1
" @entity241 foreign minister @entity265 , in a conversation with @entity133 , " expressed grave concern about the tragedy in @entity9 and emphasized that all sides in @entity4 must give up violence in order to avoid similar incidents in the future , " according to a statement from the ministry			1
" an objective and independent investigation of all circumstances of the tragedy must be done under the @entity271 in @entity4 , " the statement said			2
yet few @entity273 watchers predict the @entity9 massacre will break the diplomatic deadlock that has cemented itself around @entity4 for a year			2
timeline : @entity4 -- how a year of horror unfolded unlike in @entity278 , where @entity280 - led airstrikes contributed to deposing longtime ruler @entity281 , @entity143 has powerful regional allies in his corner : @entity284 , @entity241 and , to an extent , @entity240			2
@entity4 also has " five times more sophisticated air defense systems than existed in @entity278 , covering one - fifth of the terrain , " @entity287 gen. @entity286 testified before @entity291 in march			2
but a former @entity4 general said the country 's capabilities were exaggerated			1
" it is good to face civilians or light armed freedom fighters ... but when it faces a superior power it will collapse right away			0
i 'm saying that with all sadness because this is the army i served like for 27 years , but this is not the army of the people anymore ... it 's the army of the regime itself , " @entity305 told @entity0 's @entity306			1
@entity11 officials say more than 9,000 people , most of them civilians , have been killed and tens of thousands more have been uprooted since the crisis began in march 2011			0
opposition groups report a death toll of more than 11,000 people			0
@entity0 can not confirm death tolls and reports of violence from @entity4 , as the @entity4 government limits access by foreign journalists			0
@entity0 's @entity320 , @entity321 , @entity322 , @entity323 and @entity324 contributed to this report .			0
