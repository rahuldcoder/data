-- @entity1 said wednesday that his teenage bride 's assertion she 'd killed more than 22 people -- including one allegedly with him -- has n't changed the way he feels about her			1
" i still love her , " @entity10 said			0
@entity10 talked exclusively with @entity0 from a secure line at the @entity13 in central @entity14 , where he 's awaiting trial -- along with his 19 - year - old wife , @entity1 -- after police alleged the couple lured a man using a @entity21 ad , strangled and stabbed him 20 times , then dumped his body			1
since then , @entity1 told a newspaper reporter that she had killed more than 22 but fewer 100 people over the past six years			1
based on that information relayed to @entity28 reporter @entity27 , she would have killed a different person every three weeks to three months , on average , starting around age 13			1
if true , this would make @entity1 one of the @entity34 ' most prolific serial killers			1
@entity35 , @entity14 , district attorney @entity36 , the prosecutor who is aiming to convict the @entity38 in the 2013 @entity21 killing of 42 - year - old @entity40 , has discounted her claims			1
and @entity42 have said her claims do n't bear out in that state , one of several ( with @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 ) where @entity1 told the @entity28 she had killed			1
in his jailhouse interview , 22 - year - old @entity1 acknowledged , " everyone wants to know about her credibility			1
" asked whether his wife was upfront with him regarding specific names or locations of the alleged murders , @entity10 said , " it was about 50/50			1
" he declined to comment on whether her confessions are valid			0
@entity1 did speak , though , about his own interactions with authorities			2
" let 's put it this way : i 've been more than cooperative with every police force i 've had contact with so far , " he said			0
while saying it " would n't be best " to discuss certain things , @entity10 did say that he planned to meet with federal authorities " in the coming week or two			0
" " it seems like i have my life or death on the line right now , " he added			0
according to a police affidavit in connection with @entity40 's november 2013 death , @entity1 initially denied knowing him only to later confess after being presented with evidence police had gathered			2
so , too , did her husband			0
" the defendant stated that they committed the murder because they just wanted to murder someone together , " police said , referring to @entity1			2
the couple face a host of charges -- including criminal homicide , which is similar to first - degree murder -- tied to @entity40 's death			0
the father of @entity10 's 1 - year - old child is dead , and police in @entity96 , @entity14 -- the small city located 130 miles northwest of @entity97 where @entity40 's body was found in a backyard -- have said that is part of their investigation			2
among claims that authorities have to corroborate is @entity1 saying she was involved in @entity107			2
that assertion raised questions among attorneys , missing persons experts and even a representative of the @entity113 , the nation 's largest satanic body			0
" thorough investigation will likely demonstrate that this cult story is fiction , " said @entity116 , the @entity117 - based head of the @entity113			0
@entity0 's @entity121 and @entity122 contributed to this report .			0
