@entity1 , @entity0 -- the worldwide economic recession has exposed a " crisis of global governance " that can only be addressed by the radical reform of the @entity4 , former @entity4 secretary - general @entity3 said wednesday as the @entity10 got under way in @entity0			1
@entity3 says the @entity4 needs to be reformed			1
" the current architecture of managing global affairs is broken and needs to be fixed , " @entity3 said on the opening morning of the five - day annual meeting of global political and business leaders			1
" we have major new players coming on the scene and they need to be integrated and given a voice			0
" referring to the @entity21 , which gives permanent places and vetoing powers to the @entity24 , the @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 , @entity3 said : " we can not continue to run the world based on countries that won a war 60 years ago			1
it 's either destructive competition or cooperation			0
we live in an interdependent world and the only way to move forward is to cooperate			0
" @entity3 is one of six co-chairs at this year 's @entity10 gathering , along with news tycoon @entity38 , @entity40 chairman @entity39 , @entity41 of the @entity43 chemical group @entity42 , @entity45 industrialist @entity44 and @entity46 , chief executive of the @entity48 transport group @entity47			1
he also urged delegates to address three interconnected challenges : the global recession , energy and security , and climate change			2
" it is important leaders work on ways of finding effective , far - reaching policies -- even if they are radical -- that will allow us to create sustainable economic growth and create jobs for those who are out of jobs , " @entity3 said			1
ceo @entity38 said delegates needed to be " absolutely honest about where the world is at this point , " warning that the consequences of $ 50 trillion being wiped off personal fortunes had left people feeling " depressed and traumatized			2
" " we 've been living in the western world way above our means			1
we 've been on a great binge and it 's come to an end and we have to live though the correction , " @entity38 said			2
but he said the downturn offered a chance to set about tackling issues of energy sufficiency and pollution			0
" we must treat this crisis , whether it lasts for a year or five years , as an opportunity to set goals for how we want to come out of it			0
this is a time to shape the policies to help to solve some of those problems			0
" @entity40 boss @entity39 said the banking industry needed to admit that it had not " covered itself in glory " in contributing to the collapse of the financial industry and called for continuing government intervention to " stop a nasty recession spiraling down into something else			1
" but he said the major banks could contribute to solving the crisis as well : " i do not believe for a moment that you can have a successful economy without successful and properly functioning international capital markets			2
" @entity41 said he did n't expect any solutions to emerge from this year 's meeting , but hoped delegates could achieve " a joint understanding of the reasons for the financial crisis " and called for a return to " the basics of sustainable behavior			0
" " if we are really able to address these mega-challenges of the future then we would be able to restore the trust in leadership -- and i believe the world needs leadership			0
" political leaders will join the discussions later wednesday with @entity27 premier @entity121 and @entity26 prime minister @entity122 both due to deliver agenda - setting addresses .			0
