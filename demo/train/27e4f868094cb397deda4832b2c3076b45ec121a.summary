-- just a few years ago things were looking grim in @entity2 for multi-camera sitcoms			1
then @entity5 staff writer @entity4 wrote about the upcoming show , " back to you , " a multi-camera sitcom created by @entity8 and @entity9 , and cautioned that the format could slowly sink into oblivion if the networks did n't see results			2
" pre-premiere chatter helps , but if that does n't eventually translate into sizable ratings ... the traditional multi-camera manner in which the show is shot could drop in demand to the level of a cord phone , " he wrote			2
" @entity25 , " with @entity23 and @entity24 , was canceled after just one season in 2008			0
@entity8 and @entity9 eventually went on to create and produce the @entity29 - winning mockumentary - style sitcom , " @entity30			2
" this year however , it appears that the multi-camera format is fighting back			1
in a recent @entity0 article about this fall 's comedy landscape , @entity34 's @entity33 noted that " @entity43 , " " 2 @entity44 , " " @entity40 , " and " @entity45 " were all @entity39 scripted programs , with " @entity40 " being the only single - camera comedy out of the group			1
out of all of the networks , @entity46 appears to be aiding the resurgence with five of the eight highly ranked sitcoms , all of which are multi-camera sitcoms			1
and if you look at @entity55 's tv ratings category on its website , you 'll see headlines like " @entity46 laughs last , " " @entity46 comedy block rules earth " and " comedy lineup scores again for @entity46			2
" there are also a number of new and upcoming multi-camera sitcoms that were introduced this fall and will premiere in 2012			1
in addition to " 2 @entity44 , " there 's @entity67 's " @entity66 " and " are you there , @entity68 ? " ( previously " @entity69 ? it 's me @entity68 " ) , @entity70 's " @entity45 " and " @entity71 , " and @entity72 's " @entity63			0
" does this mean that multi-camera comedies are making a comeback with audiences ? for those who are not aware of the differences , here 's a basic explanation ; according to the book " @entity82 " by @entity83 , multi-camera sitcoms " shoot mostly on a limited number of sets in an indoor soundstage " and tend to use more than one camera to " simultaneously cover several angles as the scene plays out			1
" single - camera sitcoms , on the other hand , use just one camera to " shoot on both standing sets and a variety of off - the - lot locations			1
" multi-camera sitcoms also " are usually cheaper to produce and take less time to shoot			1
" @entity98 , a story consultant and a writing instructor for @entity67 's @entity100 , said that the multi-camera format has gained momentum again because of better writing in shows like " 2 @entity44 , " " @entity105 " and " @entity43			1
" " multi-cameras are definitely resurfacing , " she said			0
" you definitely see writers take risks			0
the multi-camera sitcom is now recognizing the value of a story mixed in with the joke			0
" @entity114 , an acting coach and author of the book " @entity117 : guide to @entity123 " said that the multi-camera sitcom 's automatic invitation to laugh makes it much more accessible to everyone			1
" i love multi-camera sitcoms , " he said			1
" i want to know when the joke is coming			0
it 's easier and more fun to watch			0
and in a time of recession , i really believe that people want to sit down and laugh about their lives			0
" single - camera sitcoms like " @entity134 , " " @entity135 " and " @entity30 " incorporate cinematic techniques and allow producers to film outside the studio			1
that realistic quality and the lack of the laugh track , @entity114 said , seem to appeal to the younger generation			2
but @entity143 , a tv critic behind the tv review website @entity145 , said that @entity46 has captured the younger demographic with multi-camera sitcoms like " @entity105 " and is doing well with its monday night lineup			1
" @entity46 is clearly wedded to that format , obviously because they have had success with it , " @entity143 said			0
" it is in some ways puzzling that networks do n't look at it and say that this is what people are still used to			0
you would think that maybe more networks would follow @entity46 ' example			0
" that could be why @entity67 is now experimenting with a new multi-camera sitcom lineup			0
recently , @entity67 revealed its mid-season 2012 schedule , which included " @entity66 " and " are you there , @entity68 ? " being given a wednesday slot , similar to the network 's single - camera - dominated thursday lineup that includes " @entity170			1
" even though many critics like @entity143 favor single - camera sitcoms as the more refined format , he said that it does n't mean multi-camera sitcoms are not acclaim - worthy			1
" it persists in the mind of networks that the cooler audience would prefer single - camera sitcoms , " he said			1
" but i do n't think anyone would say that ' @entity182 ' and ' frasier ' are simple - minded or over the top because they had a laugh track			1
" some critics are also questioning the relevance of the studio audience in comedy , which is a key element in most multi-camera sitcoms			1
@entity192 , the @entity193 tv editor , addressed this in an article about studio audiences			2
" in comedy especially , the need to suggest that a community is watching the show has become less and less important , " he wrote			0
" in some respects , this is an outgrowth of our growing sophistication as an audience			0
" when @entity192 talked to @entity0 about the article , he also said that the present generation that grew up on " friends " and " @entity209 " grew weary of the copycat versions that networks churned out			0
" there were so many bad multi-camera sitcoms , where there would be a punchline that was not really funny , but then suddenly the studio audience would erupt in laughter , " he said			2
@entity192 also argues in his article that the multi-camera sitcom 's success depends on how much attention the producers pay to the audience			2
while attending a recent taping for " 2 @entity44 , " he noticed that the writers changed lines and the cast members altered their delivery based on the audience 's reactions			0
" this was unlike anything else : theater with do - overs , " @entity192 wrote			2
" seeing the episode filmed suggested there 's still life in the format			0
" @entity192 said that while he likes " 2 @entity44 , " there 's still a lot of work that needs to be done			0
he said that sitcom producers and writers should take up the challenge and figure out how to make multi-camera sitcoms more relevant today			1
if it 's done right , he would not be surprised if multi-cameras sitcoms rule the comedy scene next year			0
" i want there to be a good multi-camera sitcom , " @entity192 said			2
" it 's going to take writers who are now working single - camera comedies to come back			1
it 's going to take someone to shake it up			0

multi-camera sitcoms like " @entity43 " seem to be dominating ratings this fall
@entity114 , an acting coach , says that multi-camera sitcoms offer an invitation to laugh
@entity263 , a tv critic , says that no one would call sitcoms like " @entity182 " *unsophisticated*
@entity192 says single - camera sitcom writers need to return to the multi-camera format
