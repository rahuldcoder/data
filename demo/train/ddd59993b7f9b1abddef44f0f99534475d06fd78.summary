-- did @entity1 just accidentally make all computers and smartphones illegal ? the state recently passed a bill to crack down on gambling in internet cafes			1
in a potentially unfortunate twist for anyone using a computer or smartphone in the state , a new lawsuit alleges the wording on the bill is so broad that it could be interpreted as a ban on any device connected to the @entity18			2
a new bill passed two months ago by the @entity1 legislature expanded the definition of a " slot machine " so that it would include regular computers being used as makeshift slot machines , closing a loophole in state laws that legislators said allowed some gambling centers to operate as internet cafes and adult arcades			1
the crackdown was kicked off by a multi-year investigation of a number of @entity1 gambling cafes that were masquerading as part of a charitable organization			1
it resulted in more than 50 arrests , the resignation of @entity1 lt. governor @entity40 and the new bill banning internet cafes			1
" there are unintended consequences of hastily passed legislation in the wake of a scandal , " said attorney @entity43 , whose firm @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 & @entity49 is representing the plaintiff in the suit			0
this lawsuit , which was published by the @entity58 , is being brought on behalf of @entity59 , and its owner @entity60			0
the company ran an internet cafe in @entity63 , a farming community south of @entity64			0
@entity66 's cafe offered game promotions to visitors , when they purchased time on one of the machines they could use the computer to see if they 'd won anything			0
the lawsuit compares these " sweepstakes drawings " to common company contests such as @entity77 's monopoly game			0
@entity1 's new , expanded definition of a slot machine includes " any machine or device or system or network of devices " used to play games of chance or skill , which can be activated by not just inserting money , but an " account number , code , or other object or information			1
" according to the lawsuit , this new definition could include any smartphone or computer in @entity1 since , in theory , any device with access to the internet could be used to play an illegal game			1
" the possibilities of going on the @entity18 and using your phone generally turns every single smartphone , computer , whatever , into an illegal slot machine , " said @entity46			1
for example , a recent @entity107 advertising campaign shows a man entering a code from a case of beer into his smartphone to see if he won a prize from the company			0
" clearly you have a device which is activated by input of a code that indirectly , by any element of chance , entitles you to a payout , " said @entity46 of the contest			0
anyone can walk into a public library and use its computers to participate in a @entity128 contest , such as @entity131 's annual @entity130 ' em , which offers a grand prize of $ 10,000			0
according to @entity46 , the owner of that network of computers could be in trouble for running illegal slot machines			2
the definition of what is or is n't a slot machine is n't the only issue with the new law			1
@entity46 says that the law is unconstitutional because of an amendment that presumes a device is a slot machine if " it is used to display images of games of chance " and involves a payout of anything of value			2
" here the burden is shifted , " said @entity46			0
" it 's saying you are presumed to be guilty , now prove to us this really was n't a slot machine			2
" arcades and business with standalone gaming machines are being impacted as well , and more than 1,000 internet cafes have already been shut down under the new law , according to the @entity162 .			2

@entity1 recently passed a law to crackdown on gambling in internet cafes
a new lawsuit alleges that the law could make all computers and smartphones illegal
the law *greatly* expanded the definition of what *qualifies* as a " slot machine "
