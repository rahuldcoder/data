-- in her thoughts and prayers over the past year , @entity1 has thanked @entity4 countless times for saving her baby after @entity8 's earthquake			1
she 's also wanted to thank the doctor who treated @entity10 after the 2 - month - old spent four days alone , crushed in the rubble with nothing to drink			1
there was one problem : @entity1 never knew the doctor 's name , never knew exactly whom to thank for treating her daughter 's fractured skull and crushed chest and then arranging for her to be airlifted to a hospital in @entity22			1
meanwhile , the physician who saved @entity10 , dr. @entity24 , an assistant professor of pediatric emergency medicine at @entity26 , has spent the past year wondering how the baby was doing			1
" i want to know , is she walking , starting to talk , is she playing , because when she first came to me , i did n't think she 'd be able to do any of those things , " @entity24 said			2
" i did n't think she would live			2
" finally , on monday , the baby many call a miracle and the doctor who brought her from the brink of death were brought together			0
" one of the few success stories of that horrible time ! ! " @entity8 couple await baby 's return last week , @entity24 sent me an e-mail asking if i had contact information for @entity10 's parents			1
" i would love to connect with her parents and see how she is doing ! ! " she wrote			0
" it is one of the few success stories of that horrible time ! ! " @entity24 , also a member of the @entity49 , had a layover monday in @entity22 on her way to @entity8 to work with cholera victims			2
we decided to meet up with @entity10 and her family			2
@entity10 's parents have lived in @entity22 since april after obtaining visas to enter the @entity56			2
when we arrived at the family 's apartment , @entity1 brought us into @entity10 's room , where she was taking her afternoon nap			1
" @entity61 , she 's so big ! so big ! " @entity24 exclaimed when she saw @entity10			1
" @entity62 ? @entity62 ? " she asked , using the @entity64 word for " walk			0
" " is she walking ? " " yes , yes ! " @entity1 told her			2
" her smile , it goes up on both sides ? or does it droop on one side ? " @entity24 asked , concerned that trauma to @entity10 's head during the earthquake might have damaged the baby 's facial nerves			1
dna testing confirms they 're the parents @entity1 , who 's learned some @entity78 in her nine months in @entity22 , assured the doctor that @entity10 had a normal smile			1
once @entity10 awoke , she proved she 's a normal toddler , grabbing toys , saying " @entity82 , " taking a visitor 's keys off a table and walking outside even after she 'd been told not to			1
" she looks like nothing ever happened , " @entity24 said			0
" and we did n't think she would live two hours			2
" @entity1 called over an interpreter to translate from @entity64 to @entity78			0
" i would like to say thank you for saving my daughter , because i always wanted to meet you and i never had the opportunity , " @entity1 told @entity24			1
" for me , it 's just a great thing to be able to say thank you to you			0
" " you 're welcome , " @entity24 said as she hugged @entity1			1
" it 's such a gift to be able to see this baby			0
" when they met monday , @entity24 agreed to be @entity10 's godmother			1
a risky procedure when the earthquake struck , @entity1 was in one part of her home in @entity104 , and @entity10 was in another part with her baby sitter			1
@entity1 was injured and taken to a local hospital , and her husband , @entity108 , who was unharmed in the quake , returned to their ruined home to search for @entity10 in the rubble			1
he could n't find her , but four days later , someone else found @entity10 amid the concrete and flagged down a journalist who was driving nearby , who took the baby to a makeshift hospital run by the @entity118 and @entity119			2
@entity24 , the head of pediatrics at the hospital , had been up for 30 hours straight and had finally lain down for a nap when a nurse woke her up to take care of @entity10			1
" she was n't conscious , and she had head trauma -- she had an indentation in her skull , " @entity24 told @entity1 on monday			1
" and another thing that terrified me was her chest was completely caved in and everything was pushed to one side			0
" but @entity24 's biggest concern was after four days without any liquids , @entity10 was so dehydrated she could n't even get an iv into her veins			1
with no other choice , she delivered fluids directly into @entity10 's leg bones , a risky procedure			2
once @entity10 was stabilized , @entity141 paid for a private jet to fly her to @entity22			0
" miracle " comes full circle with reunion " this was a big , fancy executive jet , " she told her			0
" and i laid @entity10 down , and she peed all over the leather , and then she opened her eyes for the first time and smiled at me			0
" seeing that the baby was hydrated enough to urinate , @entity24 felt for the first time @entity10 might survive the two - hour flight to @entity22			1
" i was so thrilled , but the pilot was n't so happy she 'd peed on his leather seat , " she told @entity1 , laughing			2
an uncertain future @entity1 said she hopes to find a job and send @entity10 to day care , but she 's had trouble finding both			1
her husband already works at a local restaurant			0
the family has permission to stay in the @entity56 for two years			0
the @entity166 is supporting them while they 're in the @entity56 , including helping them apply for health care benefits for her physical therapy			0
her arms , which had surgery , continue to heal			0
" i lost everything in @entity8 , " @entity1 said			0
" i have nothing to go back to , so i do n't know what 's going to happen			0
" @entity24 thinks @entity10 has a bright future			2
" she 's a miracle baby , " she told her mother			0
" for almost four days , she had almost no fluid , and yet she survived			0
i 've always said @entity4 has a special plan for her			0
" @entity0 's @entity179 contributed to this report			0
