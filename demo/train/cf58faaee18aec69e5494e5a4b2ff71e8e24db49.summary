-- having a heart attack is often a wake - up call for people to change their lives , whether that means quitting smoking , eating healthier or simply focusing on doing the things they enjoy			1
but surviving a heart attack can trigger anxiety , too : what if it happens again ? and while many men and women may worry that their heart will give out during a vigorous exercise session , an even bigger concern seems to be sex			1
to address this fear , the @entity19 recently released its first - ever guidelines for helping health care providers advise patients about resuming a healthy sex life following a heart attack , stroke , heart transplant or other cardiovascular procedure			1
it may sound pretty standard , but the truth is that , until now , patients have received little to no counseling about this important issue			0
in fact , a study last year of 1,900 heart attack patients suggests that just one - third of women and less than half of men received instructions about resuming sexual activity after they left the hospital -- and were 44 % more likely to report that they still had n't had sex a year later			1
another recent study found that very few female heart attack patients are given advice from their physicians about resuming sex			1
the new @entity19 guidelines are aimed at educating health care professionals about the importance of discussing sex with their cardiovascular patients , but they also offer insight for patients themselves			1
" these are important recommendations that acknowledge the hesitancy of couples to resume their sexual activity , even though the actual risk of worsening with sexual activity is extremely low , " says my colleague dr. @entity55			0
does your relationship need a ' love drug ' ? here are some highlights from the guidelines : sex is n't as risky as you fear			2
it 's natural to be concerned about being sexually active after a heart attack or other cardiovascular problem			1
but it 's unlikely that sex will trigger another attack in most people			1
according to the @entity19 , if you do n't experience cardiac symptoms ( such as chest pain , shortness of breath , and dizziness ) during exercise , you probably wo n't experience them in bed			2
it 's helpful to think of sex the way you might think of other activities that require exertion , such as walking up stairs , exercising , or returning to a generally active lifestyle			2
if your doctor does n't offer , ask for an exercise " stress " test : if you can walk on a treadmill at a pace of about 3 to 4 miles per hour , you should be fine , says the @entity19			2
your sex life may change -- and that 's ok			1
as i mentioned earlier , many people take a cardiac event as an opportunity to make some changes to their lifestyle			0
while you certainly may be able to return to the same sex life you had before , you may want to reassess things between the sheets			1
the @entity19 recommends considering positions that are comfortable -- the partner on top during intercourse usually exerts more energy , for example			0
if you 're not ready to return to sex completely , do n't miss out on other forms of physical intimacy , such as hugging , kissing , cuddling , and touching each other			0
masturbation can be a healthy way of easing back into things , too			0
when your child walks in during sex women are not small men			0
research suggests that rates of erectile dysfunction among men with cardiovascular disease are twice as high as those without the condition			0
but women may experience their own sexual challenges , both before and after a heart attack			1
" i appreciate that the @entity19 was careful to point out that women 's sexuality can often get marginalized , and that their sexual complaints regarding lubrication and excitation should be seen as a serious indicator of possible cardiovascular disease , just as it is in men with @entity142 , " says @entity55			2
the major takeaway message from the @entity19 guidelines is that doctors and patients must put aside any embarrassment and talk about sex openly			1
" i hope that all health professionals will recognize the importance of sexual counseling and appreciate the importance that it has for people 's quality of life , " says @entity55			2
unfortunately , not all doctors and nurses may feel comfortable broaching the subject , so you may have to raise it yourself			0
just think of your sexuality as part of your overall health , and be sure to ask all of your questions , from when can you have sex again , to how to deal with fears and anxieties			0
it may not be easy at first , but talking with your doctor -- and your partner -- about your concerns can go a long way to helping you get back in the swing of things			0
do 's and dont 's for summertime sex			0

studies show many doctors do n't talk to heart attack patients about their sex life
@entity19 has released new guidelines for health care providers
it 's unlikely sex will trigger another attack , the @entity19 guidelines say
