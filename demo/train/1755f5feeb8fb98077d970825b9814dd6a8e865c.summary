@entity0 , @entity1 -- the general and his soldiers have spent more than a decade at war in @entity6 and @entity7 but this could be one of their toughest battles yet			1
their enemy this time is not soldiers or militants			0
it is ebola -- invisible and killing thousands in @entity1			1
maj. gen. @entity19 , the commander of @entity20 who is leading the advance team into @entity1 , says the mandate here -- straight from president @entity24 -- is different from other missions			1
" we were brought in to provide our unique capabilities and fill the gaps , " the two - star general says			0
in other words , @entity19 and his troops are here in a supporting role and not a leading one			2
fight ready but @entity19 -- who still remembers his college game when he tackled @entity36 @entity35 -- also looks and sounds like he 's ready for this fight			0
as two @entity39 military aircraft appear on the horizon , signalling the opening of an air bridge from @entity43 that will put more @entity20 troops on the ground in @entity1 , @entity19 ca n't contain his excitement			1
" you want to know where the @entity20 military is ? it 's right here , " the general says , pointing skyward			1
but tackling @entity18 is a tough task and six months after the start of the unprecedented outbreak , critics say the international response continues to be woefully slow			1
at @entity1 government - run @entity18 care units , overcrowding has forced patients to sleep on the floors and many healthcare workers who say they 've gone weeks since their last pay checks are now threatening to strike			1
" there is no question in my mind that we are making an impact , " the @entity20 unit 's chief medical officer , colonel @entity65 says			2
" it is about doing it quickly but you do n't want to sprint to failure			0
" game changer @entity65 points to four recently opened @entity18 testing labs , run by military personnel that are already making a difference			1
thanks to one lab in @entity83 , patients now wait hours , not days to get test results			0
this means patients who test negative spend less time in isolation with those that test positive			0
" it 's a game changer , " says @entity89 , project manager at a care center run by the @entity92 charity that sits just minutes down the road from the @entity95 laboratory			0
" patients were afraid at one point of coming to an ebola treatment unit because they were afraid of becoming infected			0
now that we have the lab , patients can get the results back within hours			0
" but there are just four labs in a country where nearly 1,000 cases of @entity18 have been confirmed			2
as @entity19 inspected the construction of the @entity111 , a facility specifically for infected health workers to be run by @entity20 government health teams , a crowd of local residents monitors progress from just across the road			1
" while we 'll do a lot of tangible things -- we 'll build this hospital , we 'll build the @entity18 treatment units , provide these labs -- there 's a lot of intangible nature to this fight , " he said			2
you want to give people the resilience , the hope that they can fight this thing and see this through			0
" his @entity20 advance team is tiny compared to the @entity135 that will be replacing them in the coming weeks			1
president @entity24 has authorized up to 4,000 troops to @entity139 and since mid-september the few hundred soldiers , sailors and airmen and women in @entity1 have been laying the groundwork to make sure that larger force has the housing , medical and logistics in place when they begin to arrive			1
" soldiers are used to moving toward the sounds of the guns			0
these are the loudest guns that the world has heard in a long time			0
" there is no better fight worth fighting then the one in @entity1 right now , " says @entity65			2
