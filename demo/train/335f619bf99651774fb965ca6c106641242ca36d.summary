@entity0 , @entity1 -- it was after the robotic hummingbird flew around the auditorium -- and after a speaker talked about the hypersonic plane that could fly from @entity8 to the @entity9 in 11 minutes -- that things got really edgy			1
@entity11 , an engineering professor at the @entity12 , showed the more than 1,300 attendees at last week 's @entity14 several videos in which fleets of tiny flying robots performed a series of intricate manuevers , working together on tasks without colliding or interfering with each others ' flightworthiness			1
it seemed that , at least for some in the audience , a bridge had been crossed into a new era of technology , one that could change the way we think about robots and their application to such fields as construction , shipping and responding to emergencies			1
@entity11 's devices ( he calls them " @entity39 " ) cooperated on building simple structures and showed they were capable of entering a building for the first time and quickly constructing a map that would allow for assessment and response to a structural collapse or fire			1
he held up one robot , designed by his students @entity49 and @entity51 , which weighs a little more than a tenth of a pound and is about 8 inches in diameter			0
the device has four rotors ; when they spin at the same speed , the robot hovers			0
if you increase the speed , @entity11 explained , the robot flies up			1
spinning one rotor faster than the one opposite it causes the robot to tilt			0
it also can flip over multiple times without losing its ability to fly and can recover its stability when thrown into the air			0
the robots are capable of learning trajectories and manueuvers that can enable them to literally fly through hoops -- and other confined spaces			1
when the robots are formed into a flotilla , they calculate ( a hundred times a second ) and maintain a safe distance between them			1
he showed a video of 20 robots flying in a variety of formations -- and moving through obstacles -- inches from each other without interfering with the stability of their neighbors			1
to cap his presentation , he showed a video , created by his students in three days , of nine flying robots playing the @entity98 theme on musical instruments			1
@entity14 began in the 1980s with the intention of focusing on " technology , entertainment and design , " and its conferences typically are sold out , attracting an audience of high achievers willing to pay $ 7,500 to attend			1
@entity14 , a nonprofit , makes many of the talks freely available on its site			2
( @entity2 has a partnership with @entity14 in which it regularly publishes selected @entity14 )			0
@entity14 aims to feature cutting - edge technology at its conferences , and this year 's event , labeled " @entity114 , " was no exception			1
yet the uneasy balance between technology and the social issues it spawns seemed to be highlighted more than ever as speakers took the stage to give their talks ( and be filmed by eight high - def cameras for eventual viewing on the web )			1
in the first session tuesday , a sharp contrast was drawn between the unbounding optimism that a technological solution could be found for every one of the @entity130 's problems and a vision of a planet headed for doom due to mankind 's inability to control its inventions and its consumption			1
@entity137 , former head of @entity138 , declared " the @entity130 is full , full of us , full of our stuff , full of our waste and full of our demands , " and warned of harsh and potentially violent disruption ahead as the reckoning comes for a planet living beyond its means			0
the idea that the planet can sustain 9 billion people without making disruptive changes is wrong , he said			0
@entity151 , founder of the @entity152 , countered with a catalogue of the ways technology has radically improved our lives -- it has lengthened the human lifespan , conquered many killer diseases , expanded economic opportunity and made possible a worldwide web of communication , already connecting 2 billion people , with 3 billion more on the way to logging in this decade			1
" technology is a resource - liberating force , " he said , maintaining that a planet bathed in solar energy and covered with water wo n't lack the ingredients for a productive life			2
for every tech evangelist , though , there was a cautionary note sounded by other speakers			2
@entity178 scientist @entity177 , one of the leading voices warning of global climate change due to carbon emissions , presented an urgent case for taking action to deal with the effects of economic activity before ice caps melt and cities get inundated by dramatic rises in sea level			0
but an @entity191 professor , @entity190 , offered reason to hope that the use of non-carbon - emitting solar and wind power could become much more widespread through a new battery technology he and his students are developing to store power for use at times when the wind stops and the sun sets			2
@entity190 , whose work has attracted an investment from @entity207 , said successful use of his " liquid metal battery " could reduce the need for new fossil - fuel burning power plants			0
@entity212 , who demonstrated the robotic hummingbird and directs the @entity214 , talked of research on a prosthetic arm controlled by thoughts alone , of sturdy cars built with metals lighter than @entity220 and of a robot that can run like a cheetah			2
@entity14 : @entity223 on the power of introverts and yet technology did n't seem to have a solution for the problems highlighted by @entity229 , director of the @entity230			1
he talked of the rise in the number of imprisoned @entity233 from 300,000 40 years ago to 2.3 million today , the large number of black @entity233 who have been permanently deprived of their ability to vote due to prosecution on low - level drug offenses and the question he said is posed by the death penalty -- not whether criminals deserve to die , but whether @entity233 as a society , deserves to kill			0
@entity229 's talk drew a standing ovation -- and the following day , after @entity14 curator @entity245 appealed for funds , @entity245 said $ 1.12 million had been raised for @entity229 's nonprofit on the spot			0
a longtime enthusiast for digital technology , @entity191 professor @entity253 , spoke of being on the cover of @entity255 when her book " @entity257 " was published in the 1990s			1
in her new and darker book , " alone together , " she writes of everyday family and social relationships put at risk by the compulsion to interact constantly with mobile devices as a substitute for face - to - face interaction			2
people text during board meetings , shop and text during class , and even text during funerals , she said			0
technology gives us the illusion of being constantly in touch with people , yet we shirk the real demands of friendship			2
and @entity253 pointed out that @entity280 researchers are developing robots to provide care to the elderly and to children			2
as if to emphasize her point , a day after her talk , @entity286 scientist @entity285 demo'ed @entity289 - @entity286 , a shockingly realistic robot version of himself			0
while its movement and speech is limited , the robot 's technology is likely to evolve quickly			0
and so it seemed that it was n't only in jest that @entity285 said , " ten years from now , i 'll be at home having a beer in @entity286 and the robot will come to @entity14 to give a talk			0
" @entity285 said after his talk that he recognized the dangers @entity253 talked about , but he thought developing the robot was well worth doing			0
" this can never be about replacing the human being , " he said in his talk , " but about using technology to understand the full spectrum of being human			0

@entity11 demonstrated fleets of flying robots that could *revolutionize* *industries*
@entity11 spoke at the @entity315 conference , " @entity114 , " in @entity1
talks highlighted the contrast between technological progress and social issues
technology has improved health , lifespan , productivity , yet it poses *challenges* , speakers said
