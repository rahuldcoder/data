-- growing up in rural northeast @entity1 , the @entity2 of my childhood was like the @entity5 of @entity7 's " @entity6 " -- the promised land , an emergency exit from my semi-provincial life in @entity10			1
during school trips to see the @entity12 or @entity13 or the art museum , @entity2 unfolded like a weird and wonderful tapestry of @entity17 history , spanning the colonial era through the post-industrial age			1
this is the city that gave us @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25			2
it 's a town unashamed of the working - class grit that bleeds through the cracked sidewalks of every neighborhood , from @entity30 to @entity31 to @entity32			0
people who move to @entity2 find a @entity34 that 's mostly alien to those used to the cloistered wealth of every other coastal city besides @entity39			1
it 's a city of doers , of hustlers ; from the manic suit racing past the glass - and - granite facades of the financial district to the guy scrapping up and down @entity47 with a cart of bootleg dvds			2
city @entity50 : explore @entity52 beyond the headlines it 's also dirty , noisy and people there are gruff as hell ( in an endearing way ! )			1
there is a reason why the show is n't called " it 's @entity62 in @entity63			2
" i moved to @entity2 for two years after high school , and the short time i spent there was enough to leave an indelible mark on my memory			1
i make a point to go back whenever the opportunity presents itself			0
sooner or later , like an earworm , the city burrows its way inside your brain and lays eggs : your first bite of an authentic @entity2 cheesesteak			1
an afternoon walk across the sun - dappled grasses of @entity83			0
frolicking in the fountain at @entity85			0
tailgating at @entity86 before an @entity88 game			0
@entity89 : passion for @entity92 triumphs one day , you look down the @entity94 from the top of the art museum steps , and it hits you : the glittering spires of downtown are more than just skyscrapers			1
they 're almost an act of rebellion , a defiant kiss - off to the collapse of industry that devastated the rest of @entity1 and saw the population of @entity2 shrink by a quarter			1
@entity2 is so , so much more than the sum of its touristy trappings			1
it 's a city of stories , a journalist 's dream			0
i 've played chess in @entity117 with grizzled old men who regaled me with tales of how mobsters and rum - runners ruled the streets during the @entity123			0
i 've chatted up the ex-communist who ran a newsstand on @entity126 and told me stories of @entity2 's bygone days as a hotbed of revolutionary - socialist activism			1
the neat , orderly checkerboard arrangement of the city 's streets only belies the turmoil and raw action bubbling underneath the surface			0
@entity2 is called the " city of brotherly love , " but that 's a little bit misleading			1
the city 's spirit of fraternal camaraderie springs from its long - running status as a place for cast - offs , misfits and folks who did n't ( or could n't ) fit in anywhere else			0
@entity2 chose us as much as we chose it			1
@entity148 vs. @entity149 : and the winner is ... the @entity151 was the epicenter of @entity17 's revolt from @entity155 rule			0
at the dawn of the 19th century , the city was the temporary @entity17 capital while @entity159 was being built			0
@entity161 immigrants fled their homeland by the thousands during the @entity163 , and @entity2 was one of their main ports of call			2
freed @entity168 - @entity17 slaves on the @entity169 out of the @entity170 increased @entity2 's black population sevenfold in the space of a few years			2
and today , it 's a hub for thinkers , artists and weirdos of every stripe , thanks to the comparatively low cost of living ( especially in the long shadow cast by @entity148 ) , and the city 's status as a hub for financial services and information technology			0
@entity2 is , putting it mildly , the ultimate underdog city : @entity187 , part @entity188 , all heart			1
if you ever have the pleasure of visiting , see the @entity193 and cruise the banks of @entity195 on @entity196 , for sure			0
but take some time just to walk and observe and listen			0
you wo n't want for entertainment in @entity2 -- it 's all around you			2
