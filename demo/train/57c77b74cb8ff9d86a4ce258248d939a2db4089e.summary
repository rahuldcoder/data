-- in signing @entity3 's same - sex marriage law , president @entity1 said debate over the issue would be " absolutely anachronistic " -- archaic , out of date -- within a few years			1
striking down @entity9 's @entity8 8 two weeks later , judge @entity7 was more specific , saying there was no evidence for old - fashioned stereotypes that painted gays " as disease vectors or as child molesters who recruit young children into homosexuality			1
" @entity20 people from marrying based on sexual orientation , the president @entity22 appointee explained , is " irrational			2
" " often courts will make decisions that are predictors of what public opinion is going to be a few years from now , " said @entity24 , an @entity25 sociology professor and co-author of the upcoming book , " counted out : same - @entity33 and @entity32			2
" as @entity7 indicated , attitudes are changing , and waning are concepts that homosexuality harms children , defies biblical teachings or destroys the fabric of society			1
" public attitudes do n't change really quickly , but this is one that 's changing really , really quickly , " @entity24 said			1
the trend is similar abroad , especially among younger people , said @entity46 , a @entity47 law professor who heads the @entity48			2
the center has handled asylum cases for gay people fleeing persecution in countries including @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57			0
research indicates younger people are beginning to see sexual orientation as " benign variation , so that the differences between gay and nongay couples are simply not so interesting , " @entity46 said in an e-mail			0
" once that happens , societies have less interest in distinguishing between relationships of gay and nongay couples , " she added			0
before 2008 , @entity70 ( via a court ruling ) was the only @entity72 state to legalize same - sex marriage , while the @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 were the only countries			1
since then , four @entity72 states , five countries , @entity82 , and @entity83 have legalized same - sex marriage			1
watch why same - sex marriages are on hold in @entity9 while some of these entities have track records of defending civil rights , some may appear more curious			1
@entity78 resides on a continent particularly hostile to gay rights , and in some @entity95 countries same - sex relationships are punishable by penal labor , flogging , imprisonment or death , according to the @entity100			1
@entity83 , @entity101 and @entity3 , all of which legalized same - sex marriage this year -- and @entity76 , which ok 'd it in 2005 -- are staunchly catholic , and the church has made clear its aversion to same - sex relationships			1
@entity46 said she believes , in the @entity112 countries , the emphasis on religion is trumped by a drive to ensure equality			0
" my sense is that the shift in the @entity112 countries to recognize same sex - couples marriages stems from a complex set of political and social reasons and has been , in some nations , an indication of the church 's shrinking political clout , " she said			0
@entity3 may fit the bill , as the country is 92 percent @entity112 , yet only 20 percent of the population is practicing			0
watch couple comment on @entity3 's first same - sex marriage a recent @entity0 poll said @entity72 were split 51 percent to 49 percent against granting gay and lesbian couples the right to wed. proposition 8 was approved by a margin of 52 percent to 48 percent , but @entity24 noted referendums " do not necessarily reflect the will of the people			1
" older people tend to cast more ballots than younger folks , he said , and heated issues draw special interests into elections , which can skew demographics			0
@entity24 has been collecting data on @entity72 attitudes since 2003			1
while the full data will be released in his book in september , his research adds a layer of nuance to the poll numbers : though many @entity72 simply do or do not recognize gay couples as families , 80 percent of @entity72 consider gay partners a family if they have children			0
his research shows @entity72 definitions of family are becoming flexible , he said , likening the same - sex marriage debate to the rumblings preceding the 1967 @entity72 @entity163 decision authorizing interracial marriages			1
before the miscegenation ruling , researchers found younger people , those with liberal religious views and voters with higher education levels had fewer qualms with interracial marriages			0
similar lines hold true in today 's same - sex marriage debate			2
@entity24 added another variable : gender			0
women have a " more inclusive " definition of family , he said			0
@entity46 said demographics were also at play in other nations , " reaching a tipping point " on same - sex couples			0
these societies have had long - standing commitments to end discrimination against gays at work , in courts and elsewhere , she said			2
ireport.com : ' @entity194 ' fights for rights there is also " an increased demand by same - sex couples together with an increased recognition that there really are not nonreligion - based reasons to exclude same - sex couples from marriage , " she said			1
the more open discourse on a topic , the more acceptance it garners , @entity46 and @entity24 concurred			2
when @entity210 kissed @entity211 on her sitcom , " @entity210 , " in 1997 , there was enormous backlash			2
today , same - sex smooches are ratings grabs and shows with prominent gay characters , such as " @entity217 " and " @entity218 , " are up for emmys this month			2
" once there is more discussion about it as a result of court cases , as a result of media representations , people become more comfortable , " @entity24 said			0
added @entity46 , " it 's also true that as gay people live openly and as same - sex couples ' relationships are recognized more broadly , fears that the sky will fall because of same - sex couples ' marriages tend to fade away from the mainstream			0
" change is not swift everywhere , as the degree of acceptance around the world presently runs the gamut			2
@entity242 's history of international gay marriage in 2008 , the @entity244 saw 66 countries declare they would support rights for gays and lesbians , yet a 2010 @entity100 report said 76 countries punish people based on sexual orientation			1
the number last year was 77			0
@entity254 dropped off the list when its court changed the penal code in july 2009			0
" one country less compared to the 2009 list may seem little progress , until one realizes that it hosts one - sixth of the human population , " the report said			0
there are countries such as @entity266 , @entity267 , @entity268 , @entity269 and @entity270 , which can put people to death for certain types of sexual behavior , according to the report			1
there are places such as @entity277 and @entity278 that will recognize same - sex marriages but wo n't perform them			0
there are also about 20 countries or parts of countries that recognize civil unions			1
@entity46 said policies in @entity286 , which drafted an anti-homosexuality bill that would strengthen the nation 's maximum sentence from life in prison to capital punishment , and in @entity266 are stark contrasts to the rest of the world , which is reluctant to condemn gays openly			1
as for countries embracing civil unions , it 's a compromise , @entity24 said			1
people are in favor of many gay rights , just not marriage , he said			1
@entity46 described it as " typically political , where the pro-equality communities have enough power to gain substantial recognition for same - sex couples but not enough to overcome resistance from the more conservative segments of the political community			0
" to those fighting for gay rights , @entity24 said , any step forward helps because it increases dialogue and people 's comfort levels			2
" @entity319 makes things less scary , makes it more comfortable , and the more comfort you have the less opposition you 're going to have , " he said .			0
