-- not long ago , i was in @entity3 coal country speaking with college students about the power of entrepreneurship and how everyone needs to take some risk these days or risk being left behind			1
during the q&a , a hand shot up			1
" i 'm wondering how what you 're saying applies to me , " a young man said			2
" i do n't have a big idea			2
i do n't have connections			2
and i do n't live in @entity16			2
" i said the first thing that came to mind			2
you do n't need a hoodie to be an entrepreneur ! " afterward , i was haunted by his question -- and disappointed by my glib response			1
when i first started helping entrepreneurs in the 1990s , the word " entrepreneur " was not popular			1
it was a rarefied word that applied only to founders of the fastest - growing ( or fastest - failing ) enterprises			1
and at the risk of pointing out the obvious , those leaders were mostly young , male and in tech. today entrepreneurship does n't just mean starting a tech company , as valuable as that may be			1
it means undertaking any bold venture -- from selling crafts out of your basement to improving your neighborhood to proposing a new initiative in your corporation			1
the techniques involved in sharpening your idea , facing down critics , recruiting boosters and handling setbacks apply in almost every realm of work			2
entrepreneurship , defined as a nimble , creatively destructive , optimistic force , has become the go - to problem - solving technique of the 21st century			1
but that 's also created a problem			2
the word " entrepreneur , " once underused , is now overused			1
we have " social entrepreneurs , " " intrapreneurs , " " mompreneurs , " " kidpreneurs			1
" what we need is a new lexicon			2
in my book , " crazy is a @entity71 , " i propose four categories , or species			2
@entity72 these are classic entrepreneurs -- those who start new businesses and aim to become hot phenomena			1
think of @entity77 , @entity78 or @entity79			2
" @entity72 " was a term that economist @entity81 came up with in 1994			1
it describes high - growth businesses whose sales double every four years			2
though just 6 % of companies fit this model , this miniscule group accounts for nearly all private sector job creation			0
like the animal , gazelle entrepreneurs are fast - moving and high - jumping			1
skunks the term " intrapreneur , " coined in the 1970s , refers to innovators within large corporations			1
though the word remains clunky , the idea of encouraging employees to be more independent and creative has become an urgent cry			1
the " topple rate " of big companies , a metric that gauges how often they lose their leadership position , more than doubled between 1965 and 2008			0
pretending your job is safe and your company is stable leaves you dangerously exposed			0
if you think risk - taking is risky , being risk - averse is often riskier			1
even if your company continues to thrive , your ability to survive in it depends on your capacity and willingness to innovate			0
job security these days depends on the same qualities that make good entrepreneurs -- agility , imagination , persistence and execution			1
as @entity121 told me , " there are the quick , and the dead			0
" adapt from within or be forced to adapt from without			0
i 've adopted this term from @entity127 , which during @entity128 set up a secret division to build fighter jets			1
the message : entrepreneurs operating within large corporations go out of their way to stink up the joint			1
dolphins for the past decade , there 's been abundant chatter that the social sector must become more entrepreneurial			0
nonprofits need to employ more business techniques			0
despite this , too many organizations continue to lag behind the age of disruption			0
what they need are more dolphins			0
dolphins are contrarians in the nonprofit or public sector who are willing to buck convention and agitate for change			0
why dolphins ? because they 're smart , social and among the few altruistic animals			0
but they 're not pushovers : harm a dolphin 's pod and watch out ! today , even causes for which there are no compelling private - sector solutions are ripe for entrepreneurial shake - up			1
dolphins are the ones making the waves			0
butterflies the last group that needs to be more entrepreneurial are small - scale or lifestyle entrepreneurs -- plumbers , yoga instructors , bakers , craft makers			1
40 % of @entity181 adults have now spent part of their careers working on their own			0
as @entity186 put it , " i 'm not a businessman ; i 'm a business , man			0
" i call this species butterflies , because butterflies are varied ( there are at least 17,500 types ) and driven by freedom and individualism			0
at first glance , this group would hardly seem candidates for the skillset of ground - breaking change - makers			0
do you really need to be disruptive when you 're selling homemade cheese at the farmer 's market ? the answer : you do , because your competitor probably has an in at @entity208 , accepts credit - card payments with a @entity211 reader and just launched a vibrant web business			0
@entity213 , the online arts and crafts hub , now has over a million " makers " selling goods directly to consumers			0
even butterflies need to spread their wings wider			0
today , nearly two decades after i first started mentoring entrepreneurs , innovators of all types are popping up everywhere			1
they are n't waiting for changes to happen to them , they 're making changes happen every day			0
whatever your passion , pick one of these species and start writing your story -- or risk being an ostrich , with your head stuck in the sand .			0
