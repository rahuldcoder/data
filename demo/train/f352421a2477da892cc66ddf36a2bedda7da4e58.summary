pope @entity3 has expressed his intention to visit the @entity5 next year for a major meeting of the @entity7 , @entity2 @entity1 analyst @entity0 said friday , citing @entity9 sources			1
the pope would attend the eighth @entity11 , which has been held every three years since the @entity12 convened the first such gathering in 1994			1
the @entity1 announced in february that the meeting will be held september 22 - 27 , 2015 , in @entity15			2
" @entity19 has traditionally been attended by the @entity20 , " @entity16 , a spokesman for the @entity17 , said in a statement			0
" we are planning as if @entity3 will be with us and have no indication that he will not attend			1
it is important to note that reports circulating widely today regarding the @entity20 's presence are not official			0
" a visit by @entity3 , the first pope from @entity28 , would resonate with the nation 's growing @entity28 population			1
" the @entity35 population is growing in the @entity5 , and with the vast majority being @entity38 , having the first pope from @entity28 come to visit will be very exciting , " said bishop @entity31 of @entity32 , @entity33			1
@entity39 , a professor of public policy at the @entity41 , said a @entity5 visit by the @entity44 pope would be symbolically powerful for @entity45 -- many of whom have slipped away from the @entity7 for evangelical sects			1
" @entity49 have probably seen themselves less reflected in the hierarchy than their numbers might mirror , " @entity39 told @entity2			0
" there are more @entity49 bishops now than a few years ago , but the @entity28 hierarchy still reflects the @entity55 dominated by the @entity56 and , to a certain extent , @entity58 and other people of @entity61 origins , " he said			2
" having a @entity28 pope who is going to be speaking native @entity63 to @entity45 in the @entity5 will be the first time they see themselves reflected so powerfully in the church hierarchy			1
" @entity0 told @entity2 that the idea of the family has been a major concern for the church around the world , especially in light of the growing push for legal recognition of same - sex marriage			0
after @entity3 met with @entity78 president @entity77 friday , a @entity1 statement said the two leaders discussed " the family " and " bioethical issues			0
" @entity77 signed a gay marriage law in may 2013			0
in july , @entity3 said he will not " judge " gays and lesbians , including gay priests , signaling a shift from his predecessor and hinting at a possible change in the @entity7 's approach to historically marginalized groups			1
" if someone is gay and he searches for the @entity94 and has good will , who am i to judge ? " @entity3 said in a wide - ranging news conference aboard the papal plane			0
the @entity99 generally meets in september , leading to speculation that @entity3 might combine the @entity15 trip with a stop in @entity103 to address the @entity104 , according to @entity0 , a correspondent for the @entity105			1
" as far as i know , he 's never visited the @entity5 , and as shepherd of the universal church it will really be beneficial for him to have a greater understanding of the flock here , and for people here to get to know our holy father , " @entity31 said			2
while @entity1 officials told @entity0 that @entity3 has expressed a desire to attend the @entity15 meeting , no firm plans have been made			1
the @entity1 does not confirm the dates of papal trips until shortly before they happen			0
" one of his challenges is that he does n't speak as many languages as his predecessors , " @entity31 said			0
" @entity125 and @entity126 could come to the @entity5 and quite easily speak in @entity127			0
pope @entity3 is not quite as comfortable or proficient in the language			1
" in 2012 , pope @entity126 indicated that he planned to attend the 2015 meeting in @entity15 , which at the time was hosting a high - profile church sex abuse trial			1
president @entity132 is planning to meet the @entity3 on march 27 at the @entity1			0
pope @entity126 visited the @entity5 for the first time in april 2008 , when he held a @entity134 at @entity135 in @entity136 with an estimated 46,000 in attendance			2
he also met with @entity138 , @entity139 , and @entity140 , three victims of sexual abuse by clergymen			0
during the five - day visit , the pope also delivered a speech at @entity99 , celebrated @entity134 at @entity147 , and prayed at ground zero in lower @entity149 before leading a @entity134 at @entity150 in front of 60,000 people			0
the late pope @entity12 also visited the @entity5 , including speeches before the @entity99 in @entity103 in 1979 and 1995			2
