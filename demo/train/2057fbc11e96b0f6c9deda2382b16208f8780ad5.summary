-- a surprise in @entity2 wednesday night is setting the stage for an even more interesting @entity5 race this fall			1
democratic candidate @entity6 decided to drop out of the race , which means more support may go to an independent candidate against @entity12 incumbent sen. @entity11			1
in a statement to the @entity14 , @entity6 said , " after much consideration and prolonged discussion with my supporters , my staff , and party leadership at every level , i have decided to end my campaign for the @entity5			0
" the move came hours after independent candidate @entity23 announced support from a group of moderate @entity12			1
@entity23 's campaign may have a better shot now that the contest has narrowed to a two - person race			0
after word spread of @entity6 's withdrawal , @entity23 in a statement said , " this is certainly an unexpected turn of events			0
@entity6 is a committed public servant			0
he ran an honorable campaign and worked hard , and i wish him and his family well			0
" as @entity0 chief national correspondent @entity38 reported sunday on growing @entity12 concern about @entity11 ' campaign , the @entity12 needs a gain of six seats to win the @entity5 majority			1
if the party lost a @entity12 - held seat , such as the one in @entity2 , it would have to win another @entity47 seat toward the goal of netting six			1
" a number of top @entity12 strategists who have seen the latest research say ( @entity11 ' re-election ) is now hardly a sure thing , " @entity38 said sunday , while @entity49 was still in the race			1
" these strategists are furious with @entity11 personally , and even more so with a campaign team they say has not risen to the challenge			2
so there is mounting pressure on the other @entity2 senator , @entity62 , who just happens to lead the @entity63			0
" @entity38 added that " leading @entity12 voices " are pushing the @entity63 to get more aggressive , including pushing for a shakeup in the @entity11 campaign team			2
" and in the @entity69 community , there are conversations that it might become necessary to spend money in a state that no one thought would be -- or should be -- on a 2014 list of potential @entity47 pickups , " @entity38 said			0
if the @entity12 super pacs have to suddenly shift money to @entity2 , " a few @entity12 challengers in other states could see their outside help shrink , " @entity38 said .			2

the @entity47 candidate withdraws from the @entity5 race in @entity2
that means more support could go to the independent candidate
@entity12 incumbent sen. @entity11 was once thought to be a shoe - in
@entity12 strategists are pushing @entity11 to step it up
