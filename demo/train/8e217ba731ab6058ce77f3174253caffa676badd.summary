@entity0 will likely prove to be the most costly leaker of @entity3 secrets in the history of the @entity5			1
i know that we have had our share of spies			0
@entity10 was bent on betraying the garrison at @entity12 to the @entity13 during the revolution			0
@entity15 and @entity16 and @entity17 ferreted out nuclear secrets for the @entity19			0
@entity20 and @entity21 identified @entity3 penetrations for ultimate execution by the @entity24			1
we have also had our share of leakers			0
@entity27 copied thousands of pages of documents related to the @entity30			0
@entity31 is accused of indiscriminately scoured the @entity33 's @entity32 ( @entity32 ) for all manner of military reports and diplomatic cables			0
but @entity0 is in a class by himself			1
the secrets that @entity10 wanted to betray fit into the heel of the boot of his @entity13 case officer			0
the " atom bomb " spies reported out using secret ink			2
@entity27 was limited to the number of documents he could physically @entity49			0
manning , although fully empowered by digital media , had access only to a secret level network housing largely tactical information			0
@entity0 fled to @entity54 with several computers ' worth of data from @entity57 , one of the most highly classified and sensitive networks in @entity3 intelligence			1
the damage is potentially so great that @entity62 has taken one of its most respected senior operations officers off mission tasks to lead the damage assessment effort			0
in general terms , it 's already clear @entity0 's betrayal hurts in at least three important ways			1
first , there is the undeniable operational effect of informing adversaries of @entity3 intelligence 's tactics , techniques and procedures			1
@entity0 's disclosures go beyond the " what " of a particular secret or source			1
he is busily revealing the " how " of @entity3 collection			1
the @entity85 newspaper 's @entity83 , far more deserving of the @entity87 's characterization of a co-conspirator than @entity90 's @entity89 ever was , claims that @entity0 has documents that comprise " basically the instruction manual for how the @entity62 is built			2
... [ to prove ] what he was saying was true , he had to take ... very sensitive , detailed blueprints of how the @entity62 does what they do			0
" @entity83 has disputed the notion that he aided @entity0 , telling @entity98 on @entity100 's " @entity99 " : " the assumption in your question , @entity104 , is completely without evidence , the idea i 've aided and abetted him in any way			2
" and @entity109 , @entity110 ' executive vice president of news , has said , " we are outraged to learn ... that @entity89 was named a criminal co-conspirator for simply doing his job as a reporter			0
" @entity83 : @entity0 is ' the classically responsible whistle - blower ' absent " rogue " @entity3 action to silence him , @entity0 has promised not to reveal this data , but there are already reports of counterterrorism targets changing their communications patterns			1
and i would lose all respect for @entity54 's @entity125 and @entity19 's @entity126 if they have not already fully harvested @entity0 's digital data trove			1
as former director of @entity130 , i would claim that the top 20 % of @entity3 intelligence -- that exquisite insight into an enemy 's intentions -- is generally provided by human sources			1
but as a former director of @entity62 , i would also suggest that the base 50 % to 60 % of @entity3 intelligence day in and day out is provided by signals intelligence , the kinds of intercepted communications that @entity0 has so blithely put at risk			1
but there is other damage , such as the undeniable economic punishment that will be inflicted on @entity3 businesses for simply complying with @entity3 law			1
others , most notably in @entity149 , will rend their garments in faux shock and outrage that these firms have done this , all the while ignoring that these very same companies , along with their @entity149 counterparts , behave the same way when confronted with the lawful demands of @entity149 states			0
the real purpose of those complaints is competitive economic advantage , putting added burdens on or even disqualifying @entity3 firms competing in @entity149 for the big data and cloud services that are at the cutting edge of the global it industry			1
or , in the case of @entity171 , to slow negotiations on a trans - atlantic trade agreement that threatens the privileged position of @entity171 agriculture , outrage more based on protecting the production of cheese than preventing any alleged violation of privacy			0
the third great harm of @entity0 's efforts to date is the erosion of confidence in the ability of the @entity3 to do anything discreetly or keep anything secret			1
@entity31 's torrent of disclosures certainly caused great harm , but there was at least the plausible defense that this was a one - off phenomenon , a regrettable error we 're aggressively correcting			0
@entity0 shows that we have fallen short and that the issue may be more systemic rather than isolated			2
at least that 's what i would fear if i were a foreign intelligence chief approached by the @entity3 to do anything of import			1
@entity0 seems undeterred by any of these consequences			2
after all , he believes he is acting for a higher good -- an almost romantic attachment to the merits of absolute transparency -- and he seems indifferent to the legitimacy of any claims of national security			0
the appropriate balance between liberty and security has bedeviled free peoples , including @entity3 , for centuries			2
but it takes a special kind of arrogance for this young man to believe that his moral judgment on the dilemma suddenly trumps that of two ( incredibly different ) presidents , both houses of the @entity224 , both political parties , the @entity3 court system and more than 30,000 of his co-workers			2
arrogant or not , @entity0 has thrust into public view sensitive and controversial espionage activities			2
so what of his facts , fictions and fears and of the national debate that he claims he intended to stimulate ? more on this in following columns			0
another view : @entity0 is a hero			2

@entity239 : @entity0 will likely be most damaging leaker in @entity3 history
he says the large trove of data reveals how @entity3 collects much of its intelligence
@entity239 says @entity3 economic rivals will use it to *disadvantage* @entity3 companies
he says other nations will doubt whether the @entity3 can do anything in secret
