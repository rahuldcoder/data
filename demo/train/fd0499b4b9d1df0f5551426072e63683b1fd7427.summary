-- @entity2 's personal test has begun			1
at 7:45 p.m. et sunday she jumped into the water and began her 103 - mile swim between @entity5 and @entity6			1
" i 'm almost 62 years old and i 'm standing here at the prime of my life , " she said as she walked toward the sea			1
" i think this is the prime			2
when one reaches this age , you still have a body that 's strong but now you have a better mind			0
" @entity2 did a few stretches and played reveille , the traditional @entity19 wake - up song , on a bugle before she dived in			1
map : follow @entity2 on the position tracker she likes a challenge			1
at 61 , a lot of people are considering retirement and spending time with grandchildren			0
for nearly two years , she 's been training to set a record for open - water swims without a shark cage			2
@entity2 in good spirits in 18th hour @entity2 announced sunday morning at a @entity34 news conference that she planned to enter the water at @entity34 's @entity36 to begin her attempt			1
" we 're going to get started tonight , " she said early sunday as she stepped out of a car on her way to the news conference			2
" as you can probably tell , i 'm pretty nervous			2
my adrenaline is flowing , but i 've been training for two years			0
" all my life , i dreamed of being the first one ever to swim across without a shark cage , " she said , adding that when she turned 60 , she " started thinking what if i went back and started to chase that elusive dream of @entity5			1
" one theory about @entity2 's drive to make this swim is that she 's avenging a failed attempt at this trip more than 30 years ago			1
and though @entity2 admits there is some bit of athletic ego involved , she says it 's more about proving to herself and to the world that 60 is not old			1
" when i walk up on those shores of @entity6 , i want to prove to the @entity62 crowd that it 's not too late to go back and write that book or adopt that child , " she said			1
on sunday , she said : " the joke is the 60s are the new 40s , and it 's true			2
... i want to be there to say we have many , many years of vitality and strength and service left in us			0
" the swim was planned for summer 2010 , but was called off because of bad weather			0
immense planning and logistics go into making an attempt like this			0
first , the sheer amount of training it takes to get her body in shape is remarkable : almost two years of daily six - , eight , 10 - or 12 - hour swims			1
she 's faced political as well as physical challenges			0
@entity2 is determined to swim from @entity5 to @entity6			1
getting permission from both sides took several months			0
at several points along the way , bureaucratic snags threatened to tank the whole operation			0
@entity2 's team of more than 30 people consists of about 10 handlers , who will take turns minding @entity2 's every move for the estimated 60 hours it will take her to complete this swim			1
boat captains will take shifts driving the five boats in @entity2 's small armada			1
six ocean kayakers will switch off paddling kayaks mere inches from @entity2 's side throughout the journey , towing underneath them electronic @entity111 that emit a harmless but annoying electrical impulse that repels most species of sharks			2
@entity117 safety officers trained to distract any creatures that may get curious will take turns in the water surrounding her			0
" there 's no getting around the fact that we 're in an ocean here where some dangerous species of shark swim , " she said at the news conference			0
she said the whitetip shark , however , was n't bothered by the @entity111 , so she will also have shark divers on hand to help distract them			0
" nobody is going to use any lethal weapon on this swim , " she added			0
a team doctor will also be on board to monitor @entity2 's hydration and nutrition and to tend to any bites or stings from jellyfish , @entity144 man - of - war and other sea creatures			1
the navigator will ensure @entity2 is swimming in the right direction and guiding her to avoid detrimental ocean currents			1
@entity0 will have a crew of seven on board , as well as a special marine tracking satellite dish to provide live pictures of the swim			0
a sixth boat carrying @entity2 's friends is expected to join the flotilla for the last several hours of the trip , and an equally large team of people will be standing by on land to witness the end of the swim			1
@entity2 will be burning tens of thousands of calories			2
she will be replacing that energy with nutritionally rich fuel			0
every hour , @entity2 will stop swimming for just a few minutes to take in food and hydration			1
a typical meal at one of these pit stops may include hard - boiled eggs , protein gels or peanut butter and a few ounces of an electrolyte - filled beverage			0
dr. @entity175 , a microsurgeon and expert on practicing medicine under extreme conditions , says that as @entity2 swims , her body will first turn to glucose for energy			2
once her body burns through that available sugar , it will next start burning body fat as fuel , and finally turn to protein once her fat stores are exhausted			0
once her body starts burning protein for energy , he says , she will be in a race to hit @entity192 before her body destroys muscle tissue			0
" i am a better athlete today than i was at 29 , " she told @entity0			0
@entity0 's @entity194 in @entity34 , @entity5 , contributed to this report .			2
