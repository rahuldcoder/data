film director @entity0 released a statement sunday denying adopted daughter @entity3 's allegation that he sexually assaulted her when she was 7 years old			1
in an open letter posted online saturday by @entity6 , @entity3 recounted her allegation that @entity0 sexually assaulted her in the attic of her adopted mother @entity10 's house in 1992			1
the statement released by @entity0 representative @entity13 said : " mr. @entity0 has read the article and found it untrue and disgraceful			1
he will be responding very soon			0
in the meantime , it is essential that your coverage make the following facts clear : " at the time , a thorough investigation was conducted by court appointed independent experts			0
the experts concluded there was no credible evidence of molestation ; that @entity3 had an inability to distinguish between fantasy and reality ; and that @entity3 had likely been coached by her mother @entity10			2
no charges were ever filed			0
" @entity3 's open letter appeared on @entity6 columnist @entity35 's blog			1
it was billed as the first time she 's publicly written about the accusation			0
" what 's your favorite @entity0 movie ? before you answer , you should know : when i was seven years old , @entity0 took me by the hand and led me into a dim , closet - like attic on the second floor of our house			1
" he told me to lay on my stomach and play with my brother 's electric train set			0
then he sexually assaulted me			1
" the letter was released the same day as the @entity53 , for which @entity0 had been nominated for best screenplay for " @entity55 " but did not win			1
the movie also garnered three @entity58 nominations			0
in 1992 , in the wake of an affair between @entity0 and soon - @entity61 -- @entity10 's adopted daughter with composer @entity63 -- @entity3 accused the filmmaker of molesting @entity3			1
about a week later , @entity0 filed for custody of his three children with @entity3 -- @entity67 and @entity3 , who were adopted , and @entity68 , their biological son , who now goes by @entity71			1
" a team of investigators from @entity74 that was retained by the @entity75 subsequently concluded @entity3 had not been abused , " according to an account in the @entity6 , which covered the custody proceedings			1
acting justice @entity82 of @entity84 's @entity83 " said it was unlikely that mr. @entity0 could be prosecuted for sexual abuse based on the evidence , " the newspaper reported			2
" but while a team of experts concluded that @entity3 was not abused , the judge said he found the evidence inconclusive			2
" a former prosecutor who decided against pressing charges in the case declined to comment on the details in @entity3 's letter sunday			1
" as a prosecutor i really ca n't comment on the substance of the statement of this now young woman			0
as a father of a child not too much older than this young woman , i can only say i hope she finds some peace and solace in the way she 's expressing herself , " former @entity98 state 's attorney @entity97 said			1
" i hope she had access to my written statement of decision			0
my statement is as valid today as it was 20 years ago			0
" in 1993 , @entity97 -- who 's since retired -- told reporters he believed there was probable cause to arrest @entity0			2
but he said he decided not to press charges , with @entity10 's support , " rather than exposing the child to possible harm			0
" at the time , @entity0 lashed out at authorities who handled the case and accused prosecutors of scheming to keep it open to influence his custody battle			2
allegations raised again in recent months even as the decades passed , the scandal permanently damaged @entity0 's image -- that of a neurotic but amusing schlub with a talent for slapstick and witty one - liners			1
he denied the accusations from @entity3 and said his relationship with @entity3 , which had been painted storybook colors by the press , was not actually all that strong			2
he did marry soon - @entity61 in 1997 , and after the marriage came a slightly more public @entity0			2
the couple were the focus of a 1997 @entity139 documentary , " @entity141 , " which portrayed a generally happy pair			0
@entity0 was also the subject of a 2011 @entity144 film , " @entity0 : a documentary , " which briskly addressed @entity3 's allegations from @entity0 's point of view			1
however , the scandal has always been near the surface , and the open letter in the @entity6 is one of a number of instances in recent months where the allegation has been raised			1
in a november @entity156 article , @entity0 was condemned by @entity10 's children , especially dylan			2
after that article 's publication , a representative for @entity0 told @entity161 , " the article is so fictitious and extravagantly absurd that he is not going to comment			1
" last month , as @entity0 was honored with a lifetime achievement award during the @entity165 , @entity71 , now estranged from his father , took to @entity166 and referenced the allegation : " missed the @entity0 tribute -- did they put the part where a woman publicly confirmed he molested her at age 7 before or after @entity174 ? " and now comes the open letter , where @entity3 recounts not only the alleged abuse , but what she says happened to her in the aftermath			1
" @entity0 was never convicted of any crime			0
that he got away with what he did to me haunted me as i grew up , " she wrote			0
" i was stricken with guilt that i had allowed him to be near other little girls			0
i was terrified of being touched by men			0
i developed an eating disorder			0
" celebrities accused of ' turning a blind eye ' she also admonished some of @entity194 's most celebrated , mostly women , by name for " turning a blind eye " and for continuing to work with @entity0			2
@entity161 reached out to the stars that @entity3 challenged by name in her letter but has not yet received responses			2
in a series of @entity166 posts sunday , actor @entity202 -- who starred in " @entity55 " -- fired back at people asking him to respond to the allegations			0
" you are mistaken if you think there is a place for me , or any outsider , in this family 's issue , " he wrote			0
in another post , he slammed someone who asked whether he owed @entity3 an apology : " what the f & @ % is wrong w u that u think we all need to b commenting on this family 's personal struggle ? " no matter how celebrities respond , the letter is likely to fuel significant media coverage , said @entity227 , @entity228 ' chief legal affairs anchor			1
" this letter is so detailed and so powerful that i think that wherever @entity0 goes for the next period of months , he 's going to be asked about this , he 's going to be questioned about it , he 's going to be challenged about it , " @entity227 told @entity161 's " @entity235 " on sunday			1
" but i think that as a news story , it 's not going to fundamentally change , because we 've known this was her position			0
it 's the power of the details that she 's presenting that i think change this			0
