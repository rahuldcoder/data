-- from the realms of science fiction to science fact , the @entity2 mission reached its climax this week when when the mission 's scientists succeeded in landing a washing machine - sized probe named @entity11 on a moving comet after a 6.4 billion mile journey			1
it has been a decade - long chase around the solar system for the spacecraft to catch up with its constantly moving target , @entity18 -- better known as @entity19			1
for many who gaze dreamily at the stars above , this is one of the most exciting thing to happen in recent memory			0
but why should everyone else care ? to answer this question , @entity0 has brought together five experts in space science to explain why the @entity2 mission is a monumental achievement			1
@entity29 , @entity30 project scientist : @entity2 is a big deal , enough to be the sexiest mission ever			1
@entity2 has rendezvoused , orbited and will soon deploy a lander to the comet surface			1
if that is n't enough firsts , the orbiter will remain alongside the comet for over a year , watching it grow in activity as it approaches the @entity40 , getting to within 180 million km in summer next year , when the comet will be expelling hundreds of kilograms of material every second			1
it 's got an awesome profile : the adventure of the decade - long journey necessary to capture its prey , flying past the @entity49 , @entity50 and two asteroids on the way			1
the years of preparation dating back to the days of the @entity55 mission			1
the challenges of flying over 6 billion km to reach the comet , to bulls eye getting into orbit , even after a 31 - month nap , around a body we knew next to nothing about at launch , other than it was going to constantly push us away more , the closer we got			1
the passion and dedication of the teams working for so long on @entity2 to make it work , to do what it was designed for -- science			0
explore : @entity2 interactive @entity2 will show us how a comet works			1
we have been to comets before with spacecraft , observed them for centuries from the ground , but for the first time with @entity2 , we will " live " alongside a comet for over a year , sniffing and tasting it , scratching it with the lander , seeing how it is made up and how it evolves in time with its interaction with energy of the @entity40 thought to be predominantly made of ice , comets are also considered to have been a possible delivery mechanism for water to the @entity49 , along with organic material that could have provided the building blocks for proteins and possibly life			1
comets are considered frozen relics of the formation of the solar system and examining comets provides us with an insight into the conditions and composition of that time			0
we are doing archeology into how our planet was formed and evolved to what we live on today			0
it 's important to understand where we came from , to get an idea of where we should be going			0
@entity110 , principal investigator of @entity111 ( @entity112 ) : after a long and tedious voyage , @entity113 must have experienced similar emotions a few hundred years ago when he finally saw land as we did when , after 10 years , the @entity119 cometary mission @entity2 finally got a glimpse of its target -- comet @entity18			1
although we already had pictures of a few comets , we were very much surprised by its irregular shape and its rich chemical composition			0
and analysis of the cometary coma by our mass spectrometers @entity111 continues to give almost daily new , amazing insights into the ancient history of the formation of our @entity40 , the planets and the origin of life			0
to be part of this mission and to see a dream come true is a fantastic experience which makes all the years of hard work well worthwhile			1
where do we come from and where do we go to ? are we alone in the universe ? these are the questions which are an important part of humanity , the center of most religions , themes for all big philosophers			2
to be able to answer some aspects of these questions by science is the main driver for cometary missions			0
@entity2 is the first mission following a comet over a long period ; it 's the first mission close to a comet ( less than 10 km ) and it will be the first mission with a cometary lander			1
it 's a mission full of discoveries in line with great missions like @entity167 or @entity168			2
@entity169 , project scientist , @entity172 @entity171 , @entity173 , @entity174 : @entity2 is an attempt to explore not only an object ( comets ) that we do n't yet fully understand , but also reach backwards in time , like a detective , to piece together more about our origins			0
the mission calls on us to be bold , to take on risk			2
for an engineer , the challenge is like winning the @entity185 with a home run in the bottom of the ninth in game seven -- something that will call upon all her skill to pull off			0
i know plenty of people who love a challenge like that			0
i 've waited 10 years to finally be " here , " waiting for the landing to take place , and for the comet to start revealing its mysteries			1
it 's a dream come true to get our hands on this substance , metaphorically , and get the physics right , by bringing a laboratory to a comet			2
exploration of the planets , of our solar system , extends our " vision " as a human race			0
we need to have such vision to appreciate / nurture @entity49 , and our place in the universe			0
the rewards are to add to our collective knowledge , improve our understanding of forming solar system ( s ) , and understanding more about how materials come together to create environment ( s ) where life might thrive			0
@entity224 , science fiction writer , former astrophysicist for the @entity30 : after a 10 - year mission to hook itself into orbit around @entity19 , the flow of science from @entity2 has already commenced			1
@entity19 is providing surprises , from its double - lobed shape to its varied surface texturing			1
not content with looking , though , @entity2 will shortly deploy an even smaller spacecraft to land , anchor itself , and perform physical examination of the surface			1
images from @entity2 , backdropped by the comet , already resemble stills from a science fiction film			2
it 's a reminder that we can do amazing things , if we dream big			0
why should we care about a mountain - sized ball of dark , dirty ice , when there are so many other places out there ? comets are windows into the dawn of our solar system , telling us about the chemical ingredients that most likely formed the infant seas of our own @entity49			2
understand comets , and we have a shot at understanding the genesis of life itself -- and for me there is no bigger or more exciting theme than that			0
this is science fiction made real in terms of the achievement of the mission itself , but @entity2 is also taking us a step closer to answering science fiction 's grandest question of all : are we alone ? @entity271 , cosmochemist from the @entity273 : there are so many " firsts " with @entity2 that make it an amazing , ambitious , and potentially rewarding mission			1
as a cosmochemist , i 'm eager for the chemical and isotopic measurements			0
comets preserve the first solids , including ices , formed in the solar system , so the @entity2 measurements will tell us a whole lot about how the solar system formed			0
our comet samples from the stardust mission contained abundant high - temperature minerals			1
how these rocks formed so far from the young @entity40 is a major cosmochemical puzzle			0
as a human , i want to know the internal structure of comets			0
the @entity2 radar experiment will reveal for the first time how a comet is put together			2
we need to know these things so that we can protect the @entity49 and humanity from comets , which have hit the @entity49 many times in the past			2
@entity2 is an engineering marvel , as are the @entity306 and @entity307 spacecraft returning important information from @entity309 and the asteroid belt			2
all these missions enlighten humanity about our cosmic neighborhood			2
we take ownership , and by making it " our " solar system , we set the stage for humans to venture beyond the @entity319			0
that is the path to a positive future for our species			0
