-- if you asked me -- and @entity3 knows nobody has -- i would have to guess that never in the history of humankind has anyone ever actually slipped on a banana peel			1
when things get slow in my house we experiment with fruit			2
( to which he immediately realized the suggestiveness of that last sentence			2
) now , while i maintain my strong conviction that nobody has ever slipped on a banana peel , @entity18 researchers have proven that these things can , in fact , decrease the friction under a shoe sole by one - fifth			1
which means ... it 's possible			2
and i applaud this research , for it is delightfully pointless			1
at least until slipping on banana peels becomes a real thing and turns into an epidemic			1
" news flash ! this just in from @entity34 , where 600 more people have slipped on banana peels			1
one eyewitness on the scene described it as , quote : hilarious			2
" but this was real research			1
who received real awards for their banana study			1
real awards ! you see , every year in september there is a gala held at @entity49 where great minds come together to celebrate the @entity51			1
which are just like the @entity51 , but with an " i " and a " g " in front , thus suggesting nobody here has managed to cure cancer			1
at the @entity51 ( think @entity59 , but pronounce it @entity51 - noh - bells ) , instead of celebrating life - changing achievements , they honor those who " first make people laugh , and then make them think			1
" really , it sounds like the kind of event i could attend without pants			0
at first , people would laugh			0
and then they would think			0
" @entity68 ! @entity68 ! @entity68 ! wait			0
why is this man covered with rainbow sprinkles ? " the overall goal of the @entity51 is to encourage interest in science , medicine and technology by highlighting the absurd and the unusual			1
because they 're light and fun			0
and , in the end , you might actually learn something			0
as opposed to what you are reading now , which , while light and ( quite debatably ) fun , will ultimately leave you with nothing more than a permanently burned image in your brain of my naked body covered in rainbow sprinkles			0
anyway , that 's the concept behind the @entity51			1
and their 24th annual celebration was just held on thursday			2
the theme was : food			0
so , in addition to @entity98 from @entity18 , which won the physics prize , other awards were given out to such important studies as how cured pork can stop a nose bleed , and what happens in the brain when people somehow see the face of @entity107 in a piece of toast			1
the latter was the winning study of the neuroscience prize			2
i did n't read the actual research , but i 'm pretty sure seeing @entity107 in your toast suggests that your brain wiring suddenly made the connection that you have an @entity120 account and -- hark ! -- you also love being on the local news			2
that 's when you see it			0
but my favorite award was the prize for public health			1
this year , that went to a study investigating whether or not owning a cat is mentally hazardous for humans			2
the cat study was a slight variation from the food theme ( i hope ) but good science nonetheless			1
i mean , it was that or banana peels			1
or pork in the nose			0
@entity143 , come to think of it , maybe i should 've been a scientist			0
after all , i like experimenting with meat			0
( to which he immediately realized the suggestiveness of that last sentence			0
) follow @ @entity150 on @entity151			0
and prepare to be underwhelmed			0
see more content with questionable news value at @entity154 .			0

a @entity18 study of the slipperiness of banana peels won an @entity51 on thursday
the @entity51 are a parody award for science , presented at @entity49
another winner was for research *explaining* whether or not cats are *bad* for human mental health
