-- @entity1 need to show more political spine when it comes to the issue of taxes			1
this week , income taxes are on everybody 's mind with tuesday 's filing deadline in view			1
@entity11 have no interest in defending the progressive income tax system			1
@entity14 , with an eye toward 2016 , has called for a flat tax with one rate for all income levels			0
in their minds , the progressive tax is system has often been inequitable , and they claim that those who work hard are penalized for spurring economic growth rather than rewarded			1
ever since conservatives undertook their " starve the beast " strategy in the early 1980s , @entity11 have also been aware that continually cutting taxes is the best way to ensure that @entity1 wo n't have the money they need to start new government programs			1
but @entity1 ca n't afford to sit still when it comes to this issue			1
too often in recent decades , @entity1 have desperately tried to avoid the subject of taxes			1
when republicans complain that taxes are bad , @entity1 slip into the corner so that nobody asks them what they think			1
ever since @entity42 came to @entity43 in 1981 and slashed tax rates to historically low levels , @entity1 have always felt that talking about a more vigorous progressive income tax system that brings more revenue into the federal government is toxic			1
they all remember when @entity1 presidential candidate @entity49 admitted in a debate against @entity42 in 1984 that he would raise taxes and suffered as a result			1
when president @entity54 took the step of raising taxes in 1993 to curb the deficit , his party suffered in the 1994 midterm elections			1
president @entity59 , who simply decided not to restore some of the @entity61 tax cuts , came under intense criticism and was branded a tax and spend liberal			0
the failure to defend taxation has its cost			0
at a time everyone is celebrating @entity69 's historic achievement with the @entity70 , @entity1 should remember the consequences of another piece of legislation passed 50 years ago -- the @entity74 which provided an across - the - board tax cut , reducing top rates from 91 % to 70 % , the bottom rate from 20 % to 10 % and the corporate rate from 52 % to 48 %			1
this too was a historic tax cut , unequaled at the time , that liberal economists had proposed as a way to stimulate consumer demand			0
while many liberals signed on to the tax cut , including president @entity69 , others warned that it would starve the government of needed revenue right as the president was embarking on an effort to build a @entity93			1
to obtain passage of the tax cut , which @entity69 believed would stimulate the economy by the time of the 1964 election , he agreed to a stringent budget in order to win over the support of @entity104 democrat @entity103 , the conservative southern chairman of the @entity105			0
as a result of the tax cut , @entity69 did n't have much money to play with early in his term			0
when he convinced @entity111 to pass the @entity112 in 1964 , it was done on the cheap			0
@entity111 did n't allocate , and he did n't ask for , sufficient money to construct programs capable of really taking a bite out of economic inequality			2
many of the programs still did well and provided a huge boost to the disadvantaged , but the money that would have been needed to really eradicate poverty was never there			2
@entity69 also backed away from other proposals , like the public works programs his secretary of labor @entity125 was proposing , because he did n't want to endanger the tax cut and did n't have enough funds to do more			2
later in his presidency , @entity69 would also hesitate to propose increased taxes to finance the war in @entity132			2
he waited too long , fearful of the political consequences , finally approaching @entity111 in 1967 to ask for a temporary tax surcharge			0
but he did so when his political stock had fallen and the war was controversial			0
@entity111 passed a 10 % , temporary tax surcharge in 1968 , but only after forcing @entity69 to agree to steep cuts in domestic spending and after inflation had really taken off			0
another @entity103 who took a very different approach to taxes was @entity142 , the architect of the @entity143			2
early in the 1930s , @entity142 displayed an antipathy toward taxation , generally resisting any efforts to undertake a mass expansion of the tax system , which then only touched a small portion of the population			2
but did finally take steps to increase taxes on the wealthy , such as the enactment of the " @entity155 " in 1935 as well as the earmarked taxes tied to @entity157			2
in the middle of @entity159 , @entity142 became even bolder			0
he understood that we have to pay if we want the government to do great things			2
in other words , we needed " taxes to beat the @entity165			0
" in 1943 and 1944 , @entity142 undertook a massive expansion of the income tax system , expanding the number of people subject to the income tax from 4 million to 44 million and instituting the policy of withholding at the source			0
the @entity173 conducted an aggressive campaign -- using film , radio and more -- to sell @entity177 on the idea that they had to sacrifice , through taxes , while other @entity177 were sacrificing their lives			0
even @entity181 was called in with the movie " @entity183 " to persuade the nation that taxes were a patriotic duty			0
@entity187 wrote " i paid my @entity188 , " which reminded @entity177 : " you see those bombers in the sky ? @entity192 helped to build them -- so did i ! " the campaign worked and the tax system put into place remained a permanent part of the political landscape with upper level taxes reaching over 90 % in the 1950s			1
while proposing taxes is politically frightening , it is necessary			0
and @entity1 , as the party that believes in government , must also be willing to defend and fight for the progressive tax system that has been the backbone of domestic and foreign policy since the start of the 20th century			1
they need to find a way to build support for increasing rates and filling loopholes such as lower rates on dividends and capital gains and the earnings of hedge fund millionaires -- all of which exacerbate the problem of inequality in @entity177			0
if democrats do n't do something to shore up the progressive income tax system , they will continue to see the funds of government erode , limiting what they can do or even imagine .			1

@entity227 : when @entity11 attack progressive taxes , @entity1 usually hide
he says @entity1 need to *advocate* for a progressive system and use it to fund programs
the @entity11 's " starve the beast " strategy has kept government from tackling *key* problems , he says
