-- in 1936 , a pregnant single woman in @entity2 made the difficult decision to give up one of her newborns , separating fraternal twins			2
it would be 78 years before the girls were reunited			2
the two women , now living on different continents , found each other when the daughter of one made a surprising discovery during some genealogical research			1
her mother , @entity16 , had a twin sister she never knew about			1
the daughter , @entity18 , wrote a letter to a woman in @entity21 , asking if she was born in @entity22 , @entity2			2
@entity23 called @entity2 and said she was			1
in moments , she was speaking to her very long - lost sister			0
after a year of calling on @entity26 and getting to know each other , the two finally met on may 1 in @entity28 , a long way from @entity22 , where they were born to a mother who worked as a live - in servant			1
@entity34 was a cook and the girls ' father -- a man named @entity37 who never met the twins -- was in the @entity39 , the @entity33 reported			0
@entity23 said she was born with a curvature of the spine , the reason @entity34 kept that daughter			1
she could n't afford to keep both of them			0
@entity23 , who lived with an aunt for the first years of her life , said she had been told as a child that she had a sister			1
but she knew it would be difficult to find her , especially since her twin likely changed her name when she got married			1
and she had no idea if her sister had moved from @entity22 , as she had done			0
when they saw each other for the first time , @entity16 was overwhelmed			1
" i could n't speak			0
i was so happy , " she said monday			0
" it 's like you 're dreaming			0
even now i have to pinch myself			0
" the twins do n't look much alike and say they have different personalities			0
but during an interview with @entity0 , they did act like sisters , sometimes bickering lovingly and sometimes finishing the sentence for the other			0
@entity16 said she is normally more talkative , and @entity23 is the more sensible one			1
they both said they lead very busy lives , which will make staying in touch , already complicated because of the eight - hour time difference , a bit difficult			0
they share at least one trait , though , @entity16 insisted			2
" we use our hands in a similar manner , " she said			0
@entity23 said that while they may not look the same in the face , they have the same feet			2
they also discovered they married men with the same first name ( and same last initial )			0
when they reunited @entity23 looked for similarities			1
" you think , this is someone like me , " said @entity23 , who is 20 minutes older			2
both were raised as the only child in the family , though @entity16 had no idea she had a twin until her daughter told her last year			1
the two have exchanged gifts , something common among reunited twins , said @entity100 , a psychology professor at @entity101 and author of four books about twins			1
" these are the kinds of things that twins do for each other but here they have do those gifts a little bit more because they have to make up for all those years that they did n't share one another 's lives , " she said			2
@entity100 became involved with these twins when @entity23 's son wrote her an email about the unique case			1
she interviewed @entity117 and @entity16 to see how environment affects twins who are raised apart			1
she said fraternal twins are less likely to be close friends and do n't stay in contact as closely as identical twins			0
after spending a few days in the @entity126 area , the twins are heading to @entity21 to catch up some more , @entity100 said			0

@entity16 was *adopted* as a child and never knew she had a twin
her sister @entity23 knew she had a sister , thought it would be hard to find her
@entity16 's daughter discovered the *connection* while doing research into her family *history*
the two were reunited in @entity28 by a professor who studies twins
