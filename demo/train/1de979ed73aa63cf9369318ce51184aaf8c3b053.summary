-- as the @entity3 people get ready to cast their votes for one of the six remaining presidential candidates , as vetted by the country 's @entity7 and the @entity9 , a free election is under way in the virtual world -- where technology and the @entity13 are creating an alternative platform for @entity3 to raise their voices			1
with just days until the june 14 election , a cyber-voting space is running a " virtual election			1
" this campaign -- free from the @entity22 regime 's constraints -- is helping to provide a virtual space for voters inside @entity3 to " freely " choose their preferred candidate			1
@entity27 chess legend @entity26 is leading this effort , known as the " we choose " campaign			2
he is joined by other internationally recognized former government officials , human rights advocates and technology experts			0
" democracy is both a political right and a human right , " said @entity26 , chairman of the we choose global committee			1
" the @entity39 , which @entity3 has also signed , declares that the will of the people shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections -- which are not the case in the current system of @entity3 , so if we want to understand the real opinion of the @entity3 people , we need to give them an alternative platform to vote and to express their preferences , " he said			1
after the 2009 election many @entity3 protested against @entity52 's re-election alleging severe voting fraud			1
soon after , the opposition was systematically crushed by regime forces , which left the massive movement for change in @entity3 shattered			2

he adds that such tactics are suitable for societies with high levels of oppression and fear , " and @entity83 's @entity3 is unfortunately exactly like that			2
" @entity59 is the founder of the @entity85 ( @entity85 )			0
according to the @entity87 , the young @entity3 protesting against @entity52 's re-election in 2009 downloaded 17,000 copies of @entity59 's guide to nonviolent action			2
" people are not satisfied with the @entity3 election inside @entity3 because of the election process , there is no independent monitoring , and there is no international supervision , so the election is not free and fair			2
" said @entity99 , a young @entity3 who fled @entity3 after expressing opposition toward the regime in the 2009 election aftermath			1
like many of his friends inside @entity3 , @entity99 believes people are disappointed with this upcoming election , where they feel their voices can not be heard			2
aspiring to help raise the @entity3 people 's voices , we choose claims to provide a secure space , where aside from the official nominees , there are 12 other candidates that represent a wide range of socio - political perspectives			1
former reformists and @entity122 representatives @entity123 and @entity124 , who the @entity3 regime currently has under house arrest , are among the 12 " virtual candidates			1
" representing views from outside @entity3 , @entity129 , @entity3 's heir to the @entity129 monarchy is another candidate , as well controversial figures like @entity133 , president of the @entity134 or @entity135 ( @entity135 )			1
the @entity136 removed @entity133 's organization from its list of foreign terrorist organizations last year			0

" @entity26 told @entity0 , suggesting " this process can be a step forward towards building a healthy and strong civil society in @entity3 , which promotes democracy and freedom			1
" we choose also listed @entity156 , an @entity3 human rights lawyer currently jailed in @entity158 's @entity157 among its candidates			1
former president @entity160 and @entity52 's protege @entity161 - both disqualified from this year 's race by the @entity9 - are also among the 20 candidates			0
a similar virtual voting platform was applied in @entity27 during the october 2012 elections , which was also headed by @entity26 and @entity166 -- the architect of the design team behind the virtual election platform			1
the @entity27 cyber election voicing opposition to @entity172 resulted in 82,000 participant voters			0
as the @entity3 government tightens cyberspace access and begins monitoring of @entity13 activities , satellite space , and mobile communication ahead of the election , these virtual campaigners say they have created a cyber security system that can not be monitored or hacked by the regime			1
read more : @entity3 tightens grip on cyberspace " the system we have created for the @entity3 election is arguably the most secure and sophisticated platform of its kind ever developed , " said @entity166			0
" the @entity3 people will be able to cast their ' virtual ' votes without worrying about a knock on the door in the night			0
" this technology is exclusive to @entity3 inside @entity3 who can use their mobile phones to cast their votes by sms			0
@entity199 's cyber-security firm @entity198 helped to ensure anonymity for voters and the " one vote for one person " process			0
@entity26 also told @entity0 the biggest challenge for the virtual platform was " finding the right balance between maximum security for the voters , and thereby ensuring safety through anonymity , and protecting the reliability of the results by preventing mass manipulation			0
" while many still speculate about the success of this campaign and challenges to internet access and cell - phone use in @entity3 , @entity219 one of the @entity3 - @entity136 community 's leading voices and co-founder of @entity223 of @entity3 , believes history belongs to those who show up and support creative ways that support democracy and reform			2
" if you look at @entity230 and @entity231 , it all started as a @entity233 and @entity234 campaign			0
back in the days , wars and change began with shots and gunfire around the world , but nowadays it could be one sms that could be heard around the world and create change			0
" @entity219 is also a board member of the @entity244 global committee , as are @entity247 scientist @entity246 , renowned historian @entity248 and six other internationally recognized figures			0

inside @entity3 , @entity267 , a website close to the @entity7 has condemned this campaign and called it a " @entity271 operation against the @entity272 of @entity3 , that is led by one of its agents @entity26			2
" other @entity3 - government news agencies including @entity277 and @entity278 are calling this effort a @entity271 operation that is aiming to hurt the @entity281			0
