a complicated , fragmented hodgepodge of laws in each state that dictate the lives of gays , lesbians and transgender			1
living in @entity12 and are one - half of a same - sex marriage ? you can visit your partner in the hospital			1
but if your partner got sick across the border in @entity19 , sorry -- unless you are a recipient of @entity20 or @entity21 , then you have visitation rights because of a federal government law passed in 2011			2
a lesbian living in @entity25 has no protection against discrimination in the workplace based on her sexual orientation			1
but if she gets a job in neighboring @entity31 , she does			2
a @entity33 same - sex couple has the ability to adopt a child , but if that couple moves to @entity38 , the law is not clear and adoption becomes a lot less guaranteed			2
" we are living in this era of two @entity45 where @entity47 people living in certain states and certain areas have much greater access to basic rights and marriage , " @entity41 , the state legislative director at the @entity42 , said			1

@entity78 announced that it will no longer defend its ban on same - sex marriage			2
and lgbt rights groups are pleased that the @entity81 amended its proposal for a ban on same - sex marriage because it buys them more time			2

last week in @entity94 , in what would have been one of the most draconian measures facing same - sex couples in recent years , the state @entity81 decided to forego voting on a measure that would permit businesses to discriminate against same - sex couples			1
after the @entity99 passed the bill that is said to protect religious freedom , the @entity81 realized it is too toxic to touch			0
it does n't mean that advocates are only moving forward			0
@entity41 said they are watching a series of bills in state legislatures that limit lgbt rights in terms of relationships and the workplace			0
one step forward , two steps back but for @entity47 advocates , it 's more like two steps forward , one step back			1
@entity0 has also added to the onslaught			0

while the federal government has made a lot of changes in recent years , including repealing the military 's " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy and president @entity145 's publicized support of same - sex marriage , advocates are n't only seeing victory			1
' unsustainable ' the @entity146 is sitting on a federal version of the @entity148 , known as @entity148 , which would issue federal employee protections for sexual orientation and gender identity			0
and @entity145 has n't addressed the " low - hanging fruit , " including signing an executive order banning workplace discrimination of gay , lesbian and transgender federal contractors			0
public opinion is moving more quickly than judges and elected officials			0
according to a national @entity163 poll from september , 56 % of @entity161 support marriage for same - sex couples , compared with only 25 % who supported it in 1996			0
