-- movie audiences have always known the joys of in - seat snacking , but it took the theaters a while to come around			1
owners of nickelodeons and movie palaces refused to sell food until the 1920s , according to " shared pleasures , " a history of movie presentation by @entity15			1
munching on peanuts and popcorn during a show was low - class , they believed , associated with the circus and the burlesque house			1
the wonderful new art of the cinema needed a refined atmosphere , more like the concert hall than the carnival			0
of course , people ate anyway			0
as each new theater opened , candy stores and street vendors set up shop nearby , selling bags of treats to be smuggled past the ushers			1
it took the @entity36 to loosen the owners ' scruples			1
@entity40 's book " @entity41 " details the way movie theaters got into the popcorn business			1
looking for extra revenue streams , the theaters began leasing space to vendors : prime locations right next to the box office , or even " lobby privileges " for a dollar a day			0
when they saw the kind of profits the popcorn sellers were turning , they took over the stands themselves			1
the movies turned popcorn into a snack phenomenon : 5 million pounds were grown in the @entity63 in 1934 , 100 million pounds in 1940			0
the owners also realized that setting up candy counters and staffing them with high school students ( preferably female and pretty ) was an easy way to turn a buck , and all the new brands of packaged candy made their way into theaters			2
soft drinks showed up via the @entity74			0
after @entity76 , salesmen traveled the land , setting up soda stands at movie houses throughout the country			1
with more and more independent theaters opening ( a 1948 antitrust ruling forbade @entity84 studios from running their own			2
) , owners looked to the refreshment stands as a way to cover the cost of renting films			1
trying to sell more snacks , they instituted intermissions in the middle of films and commissioned cartoons of singing , dancing treats to push the goods			2
art houses , showing foreign films to an urbane crowd , began to pop up in big cities and university towns in the late ' 40s			0
as historian @entity104 points out in her 2001 study " @entity106 , " the new highbrow theaters tried to distinguish themselves from mainstream joints by serving coffee and pastries : more intellectual fare , apparently			0
the arty @entity113 chain even set up faux - @entity115 " street " cafes in some of its branches			2
in most of the country , though , the drive - in ruled			2
with more space available , the menu expanded : hot dogs , burgers , even barbecue and fried fish sandwiches were offered to car - bound audiences			2
( folks in @entity128 got pickles , which are still served there today			0
) the late ' 70s saw the death of the drive - in and the neighborhood theater as more multiplexes opened			1
on the food front , the bold invention of the era was snack counter nachos			2
introduced by @entity140 at a @entity142 game in 1977 , chips with gooey " cheese " soon moved from stadium to multiplex lobby			0
@entity147 's company , @entity146 , is still the leader in the field , selling orange goo and orange - goo - dispensing equipment to theaters from @entity153 to @entity154			2
another company , @entity155 , founded in 1992 by two business school graduates , also broadened the movie snack menu			0
they 're the people who brought those bulk bins of yogurt pretzels and gummy candies to lobbies everywhere			0
their original goal was to offer healthy alternatives to the usual snack counter candy , but they discovered that people were n't quite ready to give up the junk			1
@entity169 was on people 's mind in the ' 90s however : @entity173 report by the @entity174 broke the news that a large movie popcorn had as much saturated fat as six @entity178			0
sales dipped -- just a bit ­ -- and many snack counters started using slightly more healthy canola oil rather than coconut			0
the latest trend is theaters offering " luxury " options : premium screening rooms with cocktails , wine lists and upscale menus			1
at the @entity193 in @entity194 , @entity195 , you can get $ 17 crab cakes to nibble while watching the film			1
@entity200 's @entity199 chain offers @entity202 mojitos and bottles of @entity204 ( straw not included )			0
it seems some theater owners are still hoping to create that refined atmosphere they longed for a century ago			1
popcorn , though , is not going anywhere .			0

movie theater owners originally did n't want to sell food , believing it was low - class
after @entity36 , they rented *concession* stands , eventually running them
premium screening rooms offer cocktails , wine lists , $ 17 crab cakes
