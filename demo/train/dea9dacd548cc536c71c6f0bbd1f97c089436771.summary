in the world of military strategy , every contingency must be examined , especially the worst - case scenario			1
lt. gen. @entity4 , the head of the @entity5 , made that clear when he told @entity6 in an interview broadcast friday how @entity9 officials must plan for the possibility that @entity11 has access to @entity9 battle plans and other secrets possibly taken by classified leaker @entity15			1
" if i 'm concerned about anything , i 'm concerned about defense capabilities that he may have stolen from where he worked , and does that knowledge then get into the hands of our adversaries â€” in this case , of course , @entity30 , " @entity4 said of the former @entity17 contractor who fled to @entity18 to seek asylum			1
a hero to some and traitor to others , @entity15 last year disclosed details of the vast @entity9 surveillance network put in place after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , including how the government keeps records on billions of phone calls for possible use in terrorism investigations			0
@entity4 said he worried about what else @entity15 knows , and how @entity30 -- where @entity15 lives now -- may have access to the documents			1
he cited intelligence capabilities , operational capabilities , technology and weapons systems as potential subjects of so far unpublicized information @entity15 -- and @entity30 -- may have			1
" we really do n't know " what @entity15 's got , @entity4 said , adding that " we have to assume the worst case and then begin to make some recommendations to our leadership about how do we mitigate some of the risks that may come from what may have been compromised			1
" he added that the intelligence community also must assume that @entity30 either already has the information taken by @entity15 or is trying to get it , adding " that would be very serious			1
" because of the possibility , " we have to make some judgments , recommendations about ... how to respond to that , " @entity4 said			0
" we 're going to be dealing with this for many , many years , " he noted , saying procedures , techniques and tactics currently in use may have to be changed			0
@entity4 spoke as @entity71 has moved troops into the @entity73 of @entity74 in a showdown with the @entity9 and its @entity77 allies over the former @entity80 region 's independence			2
in january , he and director of national intelligence @entity81 told the @entity83 that the @entity15 leaks already caused serious damage to @entity9 security			0
" what @entity15 has stolen and exposed has gone way , way beyond his professed concerns with so - called domestic surveillance programs , " @entity81 said then			2
" as a result , we 've lost critical foreign intelligence collection sources , including some shared with us by valued partners			0
" terrorists and other adversaries of @entity9 were " going to school on @entity9 intelligence sources ' methods and trade craft , and the insights that they are gaining are making our job much , much harder , " @entity81 told the committee			0
" @entity15 claims that he 's won and that his mission is accomplished , " @entity81 also noted			0
" if that is so , i call on him and his accomplices to facilitate the return of the remaining stolen documents that have not yet been exposed to prevent even more damage to @entity9 security			0
" @entity4 told the panel that " the greatest cost that is unknown today but that we will likely face is the cost of human lives on tomorrow 's battlefield or in some place where we will put our military forces when we ask them to go into harm 's way			2
