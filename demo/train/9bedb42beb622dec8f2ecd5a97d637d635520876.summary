imagine being so desperate that you decide to entrust your child to a paid smuggler to help him or her cross the border into the @entity4			1
you ca n't know if your child will survive the dangerous journey through the desert , mountains or across the river			1
and you do n't know if he or she will be abused or deprived of air , food or water by handlers along the way			1
so what would make a parent take the enormous and terrifying risks anyway , and pay huge sums of money in the process ? one look at the appalling and unsafe environments these children hail from makes it clear why parents will risk so much for a better life for their children			1
and it is not just about the poverty			2
many children , for example , have n't been able to go to school because they have been threatened by the " mara , " or gangs			1
a child will be told that if he does n't cooperate , he or she will be killed			2
the threats are not hypothetical : they are very real , and will have been underscored by the death of friends or family members in their town			2
these are the horrifying dynamics that make up the plight of some of these vulnerable children , some as young as 4 , who have been crossing the border into the @entity4 without a parent or guardian			1
when i joined the board of @entity56 , or @entity57 , a nonprofit organization that seeks to provide pro-bono lawyers to represent unaccompanied minors navigating our immigration system , i did n't know that we were on the verge of a massive humanitarian crisis			1
there were no front - page articles about the thousands of children crossing the border			1
it was n't the lead story on cable news			2
they were n't trending on @entity74			2
so , i had questions about how we should respond , including the moral hazard risk of encouraging ever growing numbers of children to attempt the perilous journey if we said all were welcome			1
but i also knew we could not treat these vulnerable children as criminals undeserving of compassion			1
which is why i decided to learn more about their plight and our nation 's legal and social response			2
as part of this determination to find out more , i recently spent two afternoons at a local shelter in @entity93 doing art projects with a group of boys from @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99			2
art is a universal language and a great nonverbal way to express emotions and experiences			2
the boys all introduced themselves , some with a shy smile and eye contact , others more warily			2
the caseworkers told me how grateful and polite the boys had been once they realized they were going to be treated with kindness			0
after arriving at @entity109 in shackles and with only the shirts on their backs , the boys received showers , food , a bed , bandages for leg and foot wounds and a change of clothes			0
they still did n't know where they would be going or what would happen to them , but for the moment they were safe and appreciative			0
one boy had been making paper flowers with hidden messages of gratitude in the petals			0
" @entity130 bless you for having such big hearts , " one petal said			0
on my second visit , i heard about some of the family reunifications that had occurred in the interim , with boys either being picked up by or delivered to a parent whom some had not seen in years			0
they described a mix of excitement , anxiety and joy , with many tears shed by the caseworkers who witnessed the reunions			0
but half that group of boys was still there , and more were due to arrive the next day			0
the boys made collages depicting their journeys through the desert : the snakes , the coyotes , the dirty river , the truck , and the train commonly referred to as " @entity157 " ( @entity158 ) because of its many dangers			0
they worked in silence and with intense focus			0
after finishing , one boy decided to add a layer of ribbons over the journey picture and explained that they were now " @entity166 , " which , even with my limited @entity168 , i knew meant " happy " or " fortunate			0
" the @entity171 - speaking caseworker later explained that while one of the boys had fled his town because he had been constantly attacked with rocks and was sexually abused because he was gay , most had left to escape deadly gang violence in their towns			0
there are many aspects of this problem that may divide us , including all kinds of fears , funding limitations and the debate about the demand for illegal drugs that gives oxygen to gangs			1
but it is the human piece to the puzzle that might be the one best able to unite us			0
the fact is that if we look at our family trees , most @entity4 are the sons and daughters , the grandchildren and great - grandchildren of immigrants			1
each of our forebears had their own compelling reasons to make their dangerous journey to @entity4			1
the cornerstone of the @entity205 reminds us , in poet @entity206 ' words : " give me your tired , your poor , your huddled masses yearning to breathe free			0
" even though the surge has abated somewhat , there are still tens of thousands of children in need of a safe place to call home			1
each of these vulnerable children would benefit from having a volunteer lawyer present their case so our immigration court judges can assess whether they need refugee status , asylum , or if they can be safely returned home			1
these children deserve our compassion and a chance at a safe future , not our kicks and turned backs			1
" our need for compassion is profound and basic , " psychologist @entity231 once said			0
" from the beginning of time , this is what 's made us human			0
" the boys i met in the shelter are no exception .			0

@entity245 looks at why parents smuggle children to @entity4
she says pressure on children to join gangs is one reason
children need fair immigration hearings to decide their fate , she says
