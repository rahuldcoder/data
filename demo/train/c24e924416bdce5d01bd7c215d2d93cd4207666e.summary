@entity0 , @entity1 -- a fight between a technology titan and the world 's fastest - growing economy			1
trade war tensions rising between @entity8 and @entity9 , as @entity11 legislators howl about unfair @entity13 business practices and the @entity13 media assail @entity11 arrogance			0
no , it 's not the current battle between @entity18 and @entity1 -- but the fight between @entity20 and @entity8 in march 1994			1
" the situation then could not have been worse ... it was dire , " recalled @entity21 , who in march 1994 -- on his second day on the job as president of @entity1 -- met his new boss , @entity24 , off a plane in @entity8 for a series of icy meetings with the @entity13 leadership			1
an examination of that fight sheds some light on why @entity20 is staying in @entity1 even as it takes increasing heat from the @entity35 for not following @entity18 's lead out of @entity1			1
@entity18 announced last week it would quit censoring its @entity1 page and instead redirect users to its uncensored @entity0 search engine			1
as a result , several @entity13 companies have quit offering @entity42			0
the move received bipartisan praise from @entity11 congressmen -- and some scorn toward @entity20 for not following suit with its search engine , @entity49			0
@entity35 slams @entity1 and @entity20 , praises @entity18 " they [ @entity20 ] need to get on the right side of human rights rather than enabling tyranny , which they 're doing right now , " said rep. @entity50 , a @entity51 from @entity52 , in a congressional hearing on wednesday			1
@entity20 issued a statement , saying it would work with the @entity13 government to foster a more open @entity61 -- but it would not leave			0
perhaps because of its own thorny fight with @entity1 more than a decade ago			0
sixteen years to the day before @entity18 's march 22 announcement on leaving @entity1 , @entity20 chairman @entity24 was in @entity8 preparing to meet then - @entity1 president @entity64			1
that trip came as rancor between the @entity11 and @entity1 -- and @entity20 -- was high over piracy , intellectual property rights and @entity8 's fight for the renewal of its most - favored trade status with @entity9 , which was then under threat by the @entity74 administration for @entity20 , the trip was part of a full - court press to allow @entity20 to license a @entity13 version of @entity79 and @entity80 for sale in the country			1
@entity8 resisted , favoring local companies to provide software for the nation 's nascent computer industry			0
in news stories from the trip , @entity24 is widely quoted upbraiding @entity1 for not letting market forces decide which software should be on @entity1 's computers			1
but behind closed doors in @entity8 , it was @entity24 who was being lectured			2
" it was not so pleasant , " recalled duh , a @entity96 - born technology executive who was recruited away from @entity97 to be on hand when @entity24 met @entity13 government officials			0
@entity20 was told it did n't appreciate the strides @entity1 was making to try to curb piracy and develop its intellectual property rights law			2
they were told " @entity1 is a country with a long history -- everything has to go through several stages of development , " said duh , who left @entity20 in 1998 to head @entity109			2
he is now a @entity110 - based venture capitalist			0
" if you want to have a successful business here , you have to be patient , " they were told			0
in @entity1 , @entity49 's turn to show some spine @entity20 began a long march of rapprochement with @entity1			1
eighteen months after his chilly reception in @entity8 , @entity24 returned as part of a planned charm offensive for a causal 17 - day tour of the country			1
this time , he brought a friend along for the ride -- @entity126			0
with @entity21 as a tour guide , the trio met with president @entity64 to get advice on where to visit and met @entity13 industry leaders throughout the trip			0
duh hesitates to call the trip a turning point in relations with @entity8 , but it showed @entity20 's top executive was willing to put in the footwork on what is considered key for foreign businesses to succeed in @entity1 -- building personal relationships			1
that is why foreign @entity61 companies such as @entity18 have largely failed to penetrate the @entity13 market , said @entity147 , an analyst for @entity148 in @entity8			2
@entity1 's internet titans leave @entity150 behind " how ( foreign companies ) structure their partnerships and how they build relationships is crucially important , " he said			0
" companies like @entity18 or @entity156 are still comparatively young compared to an @entity157 or a @entity20 , who have been in the @entity1 market for many more years and are more mature in their approach			1
" they may grow fast in their home market , but foreign @entity61 firms are too young to understand the @entity1 market , " @entity147 added			0
indeed , @entity24 seems to have taken the " long view " advice from @entity64 to heart , as he reversed his stance on the issue central to its thorny start with @entity1 : piracy			2
" it 's easier for our software to compete with @entity176 when there 's piracy than when there 's not , " @entity24 told @entity172 in 2007			0
the shift in thinking seemed to be : better to have the long - tail profits down the road with users dependent on @entity20 software , even if it 's pirated			0
that has paid off for @entity20			0
a @entity188 report said @entity20 's @entity13 version of @entity80 sold fewer than 3,000 copies in february 1994 , the month before @entity24 made his first journey to @entity1			1
in 2007 , @entity192 estimates @entity20 revenue from @entity1 topped $ 700 million			2
@entity24 told the magazine he anticipated @entity1 -- which is now the world 's second largest computer market -- would be @entity20 's top market by 2017			1
moreover , the company 's @entity1 operations have become an integral part of the company as a whole			1
the company 's total operations in @entity1 are the largest in any country outside the @entity11			0
@entity20 opened its first research center in the country in 1998 , and now has campuses in @entity8 , @entity209 and @entity210			2
in 2008 the company announced plans to invest an additional $ 1 billion in @entity13 research and more than double staff to 3000 in the next few years			0
" i think we feel good enough now ( about @entity20 in @entity1 )			2
but it is a 20 - year ( journey ) and not just three years ( like for @entity18 ) , " @entity218 , chief research and strategy officer of @entity20 , told the @entity220 in a march 18 article .			1

the battle between @entity18 and @entity1 *parallels* a 1994 fight involving @entity20
sixteen years to the day of @entity18 's @entity1 *pullout* , @entity24 was in @entity8
in the *intervening* years , @entity1 has become integral to @entity20 's global business plan
