when @entity2 relaunched its fictional world from scratch last fall , some aspects of the @entity2 mythos temporarily fell by the wayside , such as the notion of parallel worlds featuring different versions of the company 's iconic heroes			2
" @entity14 , " a new series by writer @entity12 and artist @entity13 , reintroduces the concept by putting a new spin on the original versions of characters like the @entity19 , the @entity20 and @entity21 that diverges notably from the past several decades of @entity2 lore			1
in the second issue of the comic , in stores june 6 , @entity12 and @entity26 prove just how different this world is by revealing that their version of @entity26 , the first @entity19 introduced back in 1940 , is an openly gay man			1
up until recently , a middle aged version of @entity26 was one of the stars of " @entity34 , " a comic series featuring the 1940s versions of @entity2 's heroes set in the present day			1
the new versions of these characters in @entity14 have all been aged down considerably , to the point that @entity26 's gay superhero son @entity41 had to be sacrificed			1
@entity12 says he was inspired to write @entity26 himself as a gay character to make up for that loss			1
" the logical leap that i made was , oh , why do n't we make @entity26 gay ? , " he says			2
" to @entity2 's credit , there was n't any hesitation			2
[ @entity51 ] @entity50 was like ' oh , that 's a great idea , let 's do it ! ' " @entity12 's version of @entity19 differs from his counterpart in the regular @entity57 in ways other than his sexual orientation			1
" he has a ring which he uses to help manifest his powers , but he does n't have a lantern , " he says , noting that the mainstream @entity19 are members of a corp of space police who draw their energy directly from their own willpower			0
" he is the receptacle , the conduit for the energy of the @entity73 , which is this green energy			0
" unlike previous versions of @entity26 dating back to the @entity77 , wood will not be a weakness for the new @entity19			2
" he is the earthly powerhouse , and when you see him in terms of his power level , he 's up there close to @entity21			0
" though @entity85 ' gay hero @entity86 is set to face some intolerance from his peers following his marriage to his long term boyfriend in the pages of " @entity92 , " @entity12 and @entity26 are planning on portraying an idealized world in which @entity26 is judged only by the quality of his character			2
" he does n't come out in issue two ; he is already a gay man , " @entity12 says			1
" @entity26 is super-heroic , he 's super gallant , he 'll die for the earth , he 'll die for its people , he 's everything you want in a hero			0
i imagine he 's such a type a character that when he realized he was gay , he was like , ' okay , i 'm gay , now i 'm just gon na go on with my life			0
' he 's so accepting of it himself and he 's such a compelling person that the world knows @entity26 's gay			1
he 's such a leader , he 's such a good man , that the @entity111 do n't care			0
and that 's a healthy depiction of a team and how it should be			0
" @entity26 says her instructions from @entity12 were to make this version of the @entity19 as heroic as possible			1
" with @entity26 , the brief was very clear , " she says			0
" he needed to be a big , strapping , handsome man that everyone would instinctively follow and love			0
@entity26 strikes me as an incredibly open , honest and warm man , a natural leader and absolutely the right choice to be @entity128 of the @entity73			0
