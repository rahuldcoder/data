-- @entity1 opposed to longtime ruler @entity2 vowed to hit the streets again sunday , saying a violent crackdown by security forces since demonstrations began last week has energized their ranks			1
@entity8 , the @entity10 nation 's second - largest city and hub of its eastern province , was home to some of the bloodiest clashes saturday			1
still , an anti-government demonstrator there said that despite having been barraged for days by tear gas and bullets , many of his colleagues slept overnight outside the city 's courthouse and planned another rally at 1 p.m. sunday			1
" there are a lot of people getting killed for their freedom , " the man , who was not identified for safety reasons , told @entity0 early sunday			1
" our goal is simple : we want @entity2 to leave			0
" the man , a technology expert who has set up cameras airing live online video streams around @entity8 , estimated that the numbers of anti-government demonstrators in the city has grown 20 % since the protests began tuesday			1
another protester in @entity44 , a city about 250 km ( 155 miles ) east of @entity45 , said that roughly 1,300 remained on the streets there through the night and into the morning sunday , burning pictures of @entity2 and calling for an end to his rule			1
@entity0 could not independently confirm information on the escalating unrest in @entity1 , the most isolated nation in the region , though it has interviewed numerous witnesses by phone			1
the government has not responded to repeated requests from @entity0 for access to the country and maintains tight control over communications			1
instead , a report from @entity1 's state - run @entity63 news agency blames " acts of sabotage and burning " on outsiders aiming to undermine the nation 's stability , security and unity			1
the report claims that the unrest has been fomented in @entity1 as well as @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 by an @entity80 - led network of covert operatives			1
since wednesday , authorities have arrested " dozens of foreign members of this network who were trained on starting clashes , " the @entity63 story said , adding that the outsiders were of @entity73 , @entity76 , @entity75 , @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 descent			1
meanwhile , the toll from the unrest continued to mount saturday			2
while @entity97 , citing interviews with hospital staff and witnesses , reported 84 deaths since tuesday , the total number is unknown and could n't be independently confirmed by @entity0			0
medical sources at @entity100 said that at least three died and 70 were wounded in clashes saturday between security forces and anti-government protesters			0
three of those injured are in critical condition , the sources said			0
a doctor treating the injured in @entity8 's @entity109 hospital said that at least 30 people died saturday , most from gunshot wounds to the head			1
hovering helicopters fired into the crowds and the hospital was receiving a steady stream of injured people , said the doctor , who @entity0 is also not identifying for security reasons			0
his count did not include casualties from a clash between the protesters on the funeral march and soldiers at a military camp			0
soldiers there fired tear gas and guns ; the protesters hurled rocks and at least two hand grenades , witnesses said			0
" the situation is critical right now , " said the doctor			0
" the city is effectively under siege			0
" lt. col. @entity138 , who helped lead @entity1 military forces in @entity8 before deciding early this week to join the opposition , claimed that government forces , aided by mercenaries from other @entity10 countries , " caused a massacre			1
" " it is time for freedom , " @entity138 said			0
" ( @entity2 ) is not a human being			0
a @entity1 would never do this to his people			1
" several eyewitnesses told @entity0 that cars of riflemen drove past protesters , indiscriminately firing at them			0
a @entity1 woman supportive of the protesters , who was not identified to protect her safety , told @entity0 that army soldiers on saturday initially claimed solidarity with the demonstrators , only to reverse their tack and open fire on the crowd			1
" the soldiers ... said , ' we are with you			0
' we believed them , " she said			0
" after that , they started shooting the people			0
why ? why did they lie ? " other eyewitnesses told @entity0 that anti-government demonstrators used a bulldozer saturday to tear down part of a wall at @entity178 military camp , and were fired upon as they retreated			0
many were hit by mortar and automatic weapon fire , the witnesses said			0
" we are peaceful people , " the technology expert said early sunday from @entity8			1
" they are killing unarmed civilians			0
" others in @entity1 reported similar protests in the cities of @entity189 , @entity190 and significantly in @entity44 -- an indication that the demonstrations centered in the east were spreading west			1
anti-government protesters leaving noon prayers saturday at @entity44 's @entity199 mosque were confronted by @entity201 demonstrators , two witnesses told @entity0			2
security forces stepped in , firing tear gas to disperse the crowds			0
after the anti-government group moved to another square , security forces fired into the crowd , one protester said			2
a protester , identified only as @entity210 , told @entity0 that @entity1 , inspired by the toppling of dictators in neighboring @entity76 and @entity73 , had simply had enough of @entity2			1
" he will tell you that his secret police are everywhere , " @entity210 said			0
" it 's time to break this fear barrier			2
we reach a point that we do n't care anymore			0
" a @entity1 source in exile , who has knowledge of events inside the country , said saturday that the government was bringing in special military units			1
he said @entity228 factions now " control " increasing parts of eastern @entity1 , aided by " police and security forces there ( who ) also belong to tribes			1
" to counter that , the government is using " military squads of @entity10 origin , " the source said , voicing the same claim made by @entity138			2
" they are not restricted or bound by tribal ties , " and can therefore be better counted on to suppress the opposition			2
" violence in the east will escalate because of the tribal mentality of revenge , " the source said , claiming reports of violence there had already fueled sporadic demonstrations in western @entity1			1
@entity2 's regime , however , has sought to portray a different picture of events			2
having previously aired extensive footage of @entity201 rallies in @entity45 , a @entity1 state television program on saturday described the anti-government protests as acts of sabotage			1
the report claimed that hospitals , banks , courthouses , prisons , security centers and military police headquarters had been burned , showing videos of buildings on fire and the aftermath of destroyed and scorched locales			0
the anchor said that security forces had managed to arrest dozens of people , claiming they were part of a foreign network of agitators trained to spark clashes and create chaos			2
the official @entity63 also reported that @entity2 had spoken in recent days with fellow leaders from @entity279 , @entity280 and @entity281			2
the government also sent out , via text , a tacit warning against " the inappropriate use of telecommunications services ( that ) contradict our religion ... our customs ... and our traditions			2
" internet service in @entity1 shut down friday evening , though it was more available by sunday			1
the government 's firm grip on power heightened the concerns of a woman from @entity8 , who urged @entity298 president @entity297 and other world leaders to help the @entity1 people in the face of the government crackdown			1
" we have no freedom here , " she said			0
" i speak to all the world , to @entity298 , to mr. @entity297 : please help us			2
we ( did ) nothing			0
we want to live a good life			0
" @entity0 's @entity310 , @entity311 , @entity312 , @entity313 , @entity314 , @entity315 and @entity316 contributed to this report .			2
