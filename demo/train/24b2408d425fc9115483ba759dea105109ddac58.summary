-- cast your eye across a line - up of world leaders and it might look a little something like this : man in dark suit , man in dark suit , man in dark suit , @entity13 in fire engine red two - piece			2
or it could be mint green			0
it does n't really matter which part of the rainbow the @entity22 chancellor chooses to swathe herself in , her multi-colored power suits have become as much a part of political fashion mythology as @entity26 's shoulder pads or @entity28 ' pearls			1
ok , so while @entity13 is n't going to be invited to the front row of the world 's biggest fashion weeks -- kicking off in @entity33 , @entity34 , and @entity35 this month -- anytime soon , there 's no denying the powerful politician 's equally imposing wardrobe			1
but then , how do women dress to impress in the workplace ? and how has it changed over time ? from the severe khaki uniforms of @entity42 , to romantic princess frocks of the 1950s , and fierce power suits of the 1980s , @entity0 takes a look at women 's work wear in the 20th century -- and the pioneering female designers behind them			1
function vs fashion " women have worn tight pencil skirts and high heels at various times , which is n't necessarily functional , but they might feel they have to wear them in their workplaces to be taken seriously , " said @entity51 , professor of fashion history at @entity35 's @entity53 " i think women 's work wear is more to do with being mentally comfortable , fitting in , and being seen as respectable			1
" of course each workplace is different			2
as @entity62 says : " someone who 's a lawyer is going to dress in a very different way from someone working in a shop			0
" working it @entity68 across some of the most popular workplace fashions of the last 100 years , and they often act as a mirror to much bigger social trends			0
" what you see from the 1920s onwards , is this negotiating of public space -- using dress to visualize the way women are seen at work , and how they want to be seen , " said @entity62			1
" in the 1970s you had lots of debates around what women should wear to be feminist and still be taken seriously			0
some really felt you should wear trousers and others thought that was wrong because it was being seen as a man			0
" and just because it 's workplace fashion , does n't mean it has to be fashionable			2
" we 've still got shirts that look like men 's shirts , we 've still got suits based on men 's fitting , " said @entity62			0
" @entity101 fashion does n't move quite as fast as fashion itself			0
" by women , for women then there 's the female designers who helped redefine women 's wear in the modern age			1
from @entity112 's suit dress in the 1920s , to @entity115 's casual wrap dress in the 1970s , some of the most pioneering pieces were created by women			1
still , many of the top fashion houses are still dominated by male names -- think @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122			2
" perhaps in the wider culture , men have traditionally been more successful at marketing themselves and having authority over their customers , " said @entity62			0
" i think that 's gradually changing -- but i do n't think you 're going to see more women in fashion until you see more women in all kinds of roles across the board			1
" see : @entity137 -- she 's a beauty and a geek watch : what next for @entity141 's billionaire ' @entity142 ? '			0

look back at a century of ( sometimes *outrageous* ) office fashion
from @entity42 uniforms , to 1950s princess dresses , and modern *day* suits
