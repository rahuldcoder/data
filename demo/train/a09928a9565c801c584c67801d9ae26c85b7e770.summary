-- floods have devastated the landscape of the state of @entity4 , @entity5 , but they also present a high risk to the @entity7			1
stretching over 2,300 kilometers ( 1,430 miles ) along the northeast coast of @entity5 , large parts of the southern @entity7 are " flooded " with fresh water			1
currently the biggest plumes of fresh water reach about 200 kilometers ( 124 miles ) north from the mouths of the @entity14 and @entity15 , and stretch around 70 kilometers ( 43 miles ) off the coast			1
" these are extraordinary events			0
the whole of the inner - shore reef lagoon filled with river water , " says @entity18 , principle researcher for the @entity20 's @entity19 for @entity21			1
@entity18 and his team regularly monitor the reefs and are immersed in studying the impact of the flood waters			2
@entity18 describes the threat to many coral reefs closest to the flooding rivers as " quite high " but expects the flood waters to affect in some way the reefs stretching from @entity35 , 200 kilometers ( 124 miles ) north of @entity36 , all the way to @entity38 , 1,500 kilometers ( 930 miles ) away			1
the prevailing tides and south easterly winds mean the flood waters will probably continue to head north			2
" it 's quite remarkable to see			0
if you were to snorkel where the flood water meets the seawater and look to one side , the sea water will be clear with visibility to 50 meters while the other side is fresh , dirty brown water where visibility is down to one meter , " says @entity18			1
the mix of nutrients , sediment and pesticides from agricultural run - off , plus currently unknown amounts of trace metals from flooded mines , will likely have an immediately devastating impact on corals and sea grasses , says @entity18			1
salinity could go down to ten parts per thousand or less and remain like that for weeks ; " nothing can live in those conditions , " says @entity18			2
the immediate death of corals and sea grass is expected , which could then have a devastating affect on other marine creatures like dugongs that feed on sea grass			1
when the @entity78 ( that flooded @entity79 before @entity80 ) suffered severe flooding in 1991 , the corals and sea grasses around the @entity77 suffered 100 percent coral mortality			1
bigger fishes can swim away from the deluge of fresh water , but smaller coral reef fish may suffer the same fate as the corals they live around , says @entity18			1
while corals can recover from " bleaching " ( when coral organisms die leaving what looks like a white skeletal structure ) , it 's a slow process			1
some recovery around the @entity97 was seen after 10 years , while other coral species and marine organisms were still recovering until the latest floods			2
other marine species can actually benefit from floods			0
" some fish species thrive in the current flood plume conditions which can enhance productivity for some popular inshore species , " @entity103 , general manager of the @entity104 said in a press statement			2
other unwanted long term effects can be algae blooms which can upset the reef ecosystems			0
" it will take some time before the impacts of these flood plumes on the marine ecosystem and on the industries that use these areas are known , " said @entity103			0
climate scientists have blamed the excessive rainfall the region has seen in the last month on the latest @entity123 weather event			0
@entity123 refers to the cooling of the central and eastern @entity125 that drives wetter conditions in eastern @entity5			0
@entity18 agrees with the cause of the heavy rain : " it was predicted			0
it certainly fits the pattern of severe weather events from climate change modeling			0
" @entity4 suffered its wettest ever december , according to the @entity136 , during what it describes as a " very strong " @entity123 event in the @entity125			0
in june 2010 the bureau stated that @entity123 was likely to have an affect on @entity5 by the end of that year			0
a previous @entity123 event happened in 1974 when a record flood of the @entity143 killed 14 people .			0

flood water will have devastating affect on corals and sea grass in parts of @entity7
flood water is full of sediment , pesticides and nutrients that kill corals
inshore coral reef lagoon region likely to be full of fresh water for weeks
coral reefs can take over a decade to recover from ' bleaching '
