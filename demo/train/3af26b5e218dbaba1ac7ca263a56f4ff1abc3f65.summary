@entity0 -- voting on strictly partisan lines , a @entity3 committee recommended wednesday that attorney general @entity5 be cited for contempt of @entity7 for failing to turn over documents relating to the botched @entity10 weapons sting operation			1
the vote ended an extraordinary daylong hearing that took place after president @entity15 asserted executive privilege over some documents sought by the panel investigating @entity10			1
the @entity3 move means the @entity20 can withhold some of the documents			1
the committee measure now goes to the @entity23 for consideration , expected next week , of what would be an unprecedented action -- @entity7 holding a sitting attorney general in contempt			1
what happens if panel cites @entity5 for contempt ? " unless the attorney general re-evaluates his choice and supplies the promised documents , the @entity3 will vote to hold him in contempt next week , " said a statement by the chamber 's @entity33 leaders			1
" if , however , attorney general holder produces these documents prior to the scheduled vote , we will give the ( committee ) an opportunity to review in hopes of resolving this issue			1
" all 23 @entity33 on the @entity46 supported the contempt measure , while the 17 @entity48 opposed it , reflecting the deep political divide on the issue			1
@entity46 chairman rep. @entity51 , @entity52 , refused to put off consideration of the measure , saying the @entity3 assertion of executive privilege " falls short " of any reason to delay the hearing			1
executive privilege : a rocky legal and political road in @entity62 history however , @entity51 said after the hearing that he believes a settlement to avoid an unprecedented contempt vote in the @entity3 is " in the best interest of the @entity20 , @entity7 and those most directly affected by @entity10			1
" in a statement later wednesday , @entity5 called @entity51 's decision to hold the vote " an election - year tactic " and " an extraordinary , unprecedented and entirely unnecessary action , intended to provoke an avoidable conflict between @entity7 and the executive branch			1
" the committee 's top @entity75 , rep. @entity77 of @entity78 , accused @entity51 of setting an " impossible standard " for @entity5 by initially demanding documents the attorney general is legally prohibited from providing			1
now @entity51 has " no interest in resolving " the dispute with @entity5 , @entity77 said			0
wednesday 's developments further heightened the drama of a high - profile showdown between @entity51 and @entity5 over the @entity10 program that dates back to subpoenas issued by the @entity76 last year			1
what do you think of the controversy ? the @entity92 launched @entity10 out of @entity93 to track weapon purchases by @entity96 drug cartels			2
however , it lost track of more than 1,000 firearms that the agency had allowed straw buyers to carry across the border , and two of the lost weapons turned up at the scene of the 2010 killing of @entity107 agent @entity10			2
@entity51 's committee is specifically seeking documents that show why the @entity20 decided to withdraw as inaccurate a february 2011 letter sent to @entity7 that said top officials had only recently learned about @entity10			1
the stalemate over the documents escalated dramatically wednesday			2
@entity1 senior political analyst and former presidential adviser @entity114 said such dusts - ups are usually resolved by political @entity117 's not been the case here			2
" for a lot of @entity62 who do n't understand the complexities and really do n't care about the complexity of this , it is one more illustration ... that @entity0 is broken , " @entity114 said			0
but the impasse also shows something about @entity5 's resolve , he told " @entity129			0
" " he 's stiffened his spine , " @entity114 said			0
" he has been under pressure to resign from some quarters in the @entity33			0
he ai n't going anywhere			0
" now the question is whether a settlement can be reached before the @entity3 vote			1
if the @entity3 finds @entity5 in contempt , it is unlikely he will be prosecuted for criminal contempt , according to @entity141 , associated dean at @entity142			1
" it would look like terrible overreaching to go for criminal contempt , " @entity141 said , which carries a penalty of $ 1,000 and up to one year in prison			2
instead , @entity141 said , it is more likely the @entity3 would pursue civil prosecution in federal court			2
the @entity76 vote came more than six hours after notice that @entity15 had asserted executive privilege			0
in a letter to @entity15 seeking that action , @entity5 said the documents involved related to the @entity20 's " response to congressional oversight and related media inquiries , " and that release of internal executive branch documents would have " significant , damaging consequences			0
" @entity5 contempt vote could come next week @entity5 also said releasing the documents would " inhibit the candor of executive branch deliberations in the future and significantly impair the ability of the executive branch to respond independently and effectively to congressional oversight			1
" @entity5 said he offered to turn over some of the documents sought by @entity51 when they met tuesday in a final effort to resolve the dispute before wednesday 's hearing			0
@entity51 , however , said @entity5 put unreasonable conditions on his offer			0
in a letter to @entity51 after tuesday 's meeting , deputy attorney general @entity177 reiterated @entity5 's position that the documents would show @entity5 had nothing to hide about his role in @entity10			1
@entity177 noted that the lone point of dispute was whether the february 4 , 2011 , letter was part of a broader effort to obstruct a congressional investigation			0
" the answer to that question is an emphatic ' no , ' and we have offered the committee the opportunity to satisfy itself that that is so , " @entity177 wrote			0
the department says it already has handed over more than 7,000 pages of records to @entity3 investigators and that the remaining material @entity51 wants could jeopardize criminal prosecutions			2
@entity51 and other republicans on the panel mentioned @entity10 's death by name in accusing @entity5 and the @entity20 of trying to stonewall the investigation of what happened			1
" the @entity20 has fought this investigation every step of the way , " @entity51 said			0
" at the heart of the congressional investigation into @entity10 are disastrous consequences : a murdered @entity107 agent , his grieving family seeking answers , countless deaths in @entity96 , and the souring effect on our relationship with @entity96 , " @entity51 said in a statement			2
" @entity7 has not just a right but an obligation to do all that it can to uncover exactly what happened and ensure that it never occurs again			0
" see letter to @entity51 from deputy attorney general (			1
@entity226 ) @entity10 's family issued a statement wednesday that called for all of the documents sought by the committee to be turned over			1
" our son lost his life protecting this nation , and it is very disappointing that we are now faced with an administration that seems more concerned with protecting themselves rather than revealing the truth behind @entity10 , " the statement said			2
the mother of another federal agent said wednesday she wants to know the " full truth " about his death			0
@entity245 agent @entity244 , who was working for the @entity62 in @entity96 , was murdered in february 2011 when his vehicle was ambushed on a highway between @entity248 and @entity249			0
sen. @entity250 , @entity251 , last year said he wanted to know if a @entity253 - based " gun walking " program may have played a role in @entity244 's murder			1
he said one of the weapons used in the slaying was allegedly purchased in @entity253 and trafficked to @entity96			0
" unfortunately , the situation regarding @entity10 as well as other gun - walking operations has been something that has damaged the lives of many , " @entity244 's mother , @entity259 , said in a statement			1
" i would have hoped that transparency would have been a priority so that we , like so many others , could get some answers			0
" @entity5 floats ' @entity10 ' deal with @entity7 the tuesday meeting between @entity51 and @entity5 amounted to little more than a reiteration of the positions the two staked out in an exchange of letters the previous week			1
" any claims that the @entity20 has been unresponsive to requests for information are untrue , " @entity5 said , noting he shut @entity10 down			2
the subpoenas issued last year originally cited a broad array of documents , including wiretap requests and other materials involving confidential sources that @entity5 argued he was prevented by law from supplying			2
@entity51 narrowed the request in negotiations with @entity5 in recent weeks			0
@entity5 rejects resignation call at heated @entity290 hearing @entity48 argued the documents demanded by @entity51 related to internal discussions about responding to the @entity10 investigation , rather than the committee 's intended purpose of finding out who authorized the failed program			1
the party - line division in the panel extended to the portrayal of the tuesday meeting attended by @entity5 , @entity51 , @entity77 and others			2
@entity51 and @entity33 rejected the conditions of @entity5 's offer , while @entity305 and @entity48 said the panel should work with @entity5 to seek a resolution			0
@entity51 said he was surprised by @entity15 's action and questioned whether the @entity3 's role in @entity10 " has been greater than previously acknowledged			1
" on the border : guns , drugs -- and a betrayal of trust sen. @entity315 of @entity316 , the ranking @entity33 member of the @entity317 , told @entity1 he previously traced the program only up to the level of an assistant attorney general			1
" now it raises the question of what does the president know and when did he know it by the claim of executive privilege , " said @entity315 , who participated in tuesday 's meeting			0
but @entity329 , professor at the @entity331 's @entity330 , said it does not appear @entity15 was involved with the @entity10 program			2
" he is trying to protect the prerogatives of the department and the people who work for him , " @entity329 said of the executive privilege			0
@entity1 senior legal analyst @entity340 said that while @entity5 may be embarrassed , he wo n't ultimately be found in contempt			0
" this is going to be just another political dispute , " @entity340 told @entity1 's @entity342			0
" if people remember at all , they 'll remember 23 republicans were for it , 17 @entity48 were against it			0
" @entity1 's @entity348 , @entity349 , @entity350 , @entity351 and @entity352 contributed to this report .			0
