-- nobody gave them a chance -- nobody			1
perhaps they did n't want to			2
for all of the joking and laughing that @entity10 would simply turn up in @entity11 to make up the numbers , there were those who knew the reality would be different			1
" think big " is the motto that @entity10 coach @entity14 has always subscribed to			1
and the @entity16 practices what he preaches -- qualification from the group stage was always going to be achieved if you speak to those within the @entity24 camp			2
bravado ? a fool 's hope ? no , this is a side which plays with a belief that comes straight from the very top and trickles through the veins of its players			2
but it would be foolish to claim that this team has only succeeded because of the spirit which @entity14 has engendered -- it has talent too , lots of it			2
@entity38 , also playing in the last 16 of the @entity39 for the first time , fell the way of @entity42 and @entity43 on sunday , beaten by a side playing with a confidence and belief that appears to be unshakable			1
with the game having reached penalty kicks following a 1 - 1 draw inside 120 minutes , both sets of players had already given everything they had			2
@entity10 's players , who had already suffered the ignominy of having victory snatched away from them , appeared to be running through treacle as they dragged their tired limbs down the field , stretching every muscle and sinew			1
but having survived to make it through to penalties , those same players found the strength and skill to write yet another chapter in this incredible tale			2
all seven players had scored and , with his side trailing at 3 - 4 in the shootout , @entity69 strode towards the penalty spot			1
but there was a look in his eyes -- fear			2
@entity77 appeared to stand still			0
the 34 - year - old looked at the ball , looked at the goal -- but that look of trepidation never left his face			2
perhaps @entity84 had noticed , perhaps he had n't			0
for when @entity69 stepped forward and placed the ball to the goalkeeper 's right , @entity84 flew across to palm the ball away			1
forward came @entity92 -- a 31 - year - old defender who plays in his home country with @entity94			2
he placed the ball down , a piece of grass stuck to his cheek courtesy of the sweat which dripped from his brow			0
there was no shimmy , no stutter , no hesitation			0
as the ball hit the back of the net , those in white shirts forgot the aches and pains which had left their limbs in agony			0
whereas moments ago they could barely walk , now those men draped in the flag of @entity10 danced their way into the @entity11 night			1
" last night , i dreamed this , " @entity92 told reporters			0
i was relaxed because i dreamed it			0
i dreamed it but i did n't tell anyone			0
" this is for my family			0
it 's for the colleagues who got injured before coming here			0
they 're not with us , but they gave us a hand on the pitch			2
" in the end this proved to be a rather exciting contest -- a world away from what was served up in the opening 45 minutes			0
it was @entity38 that produced the only real opportunity eight minutes before the interval when @entity145 forced @entity84 into a fine reflex save from close range			1
at least the second half was better -- both sides dispensing with their cautious approaches and attempting to take the advantage			0
@entity152 tested @entity84 with a powerful header as @entity38 , which qualified following a dramatic late victory over the @entity155 , began to move forward with purpose			1
but just as it appeared that @entity38 was ready to take control , @entity10 pounced			1
captain @entity158 , the man whose goal saw off @entity43 , was the hero once again -- taking @entity161 ' pass in his stride before carefully placing his effort beyond the reach of @entity165 in the @entity167 goal			1
that strike sparked scenes of jubilation on the touchline with @entity14 , animated at the best of times , celebrating his team 's latest success			0
having only conceded once in three previous games , @entity10 's defense looked more than comfortable as @entity38 attempted a fightback			1
but with 24 minutes remaining , disaster struck for @entity10			1
@entity179 , one of the team 's most dependable members , rushed into a challenge on @entity183 , taking out the @entity167 player and earning himself a second yellow card			0
as referee @entity186 held the red card aloft , @entity179 left the pitch almost inconsolable , leaving behind his 10 teammates to try to hang on			0
and hold out it did -- @entity10 's tenacious approach kept goalkeeper @entity84 almost unemployed as the clock began to tick down			1
but just as its players began to dream of the quarterfinals , @entity38 , one of the most belligerent teams in international football , proved why it remains so difficult to beat			1
with 90 minutes up , substitute @entity69 ' low shot was only parried by @entity84 and @entity200 lashed home			1
while the @entity24 fell to their knees , those in blue continued the onslaught knowing its opponent had been wounded			0
it might have even won it inside the 90 minutes had it not been for a wonderful save by @entity210 , somehow reaching to tip @entity212 's header over the crossbar			0
with neither side able to find the elusive winning goal , the tie moved into 30 minutes of extra time			0
as @entity10 began to tire , it was @entity38 which took control and @entity212 was denied a dramatic late winner by @entity210 when the striker looked certain to score			1
that ensured the tie would be decided on penalties and when @entity69 had his effort saved , @entity92 stood up to rewrite history			1
a tie with the @entity227 in @entity228 next saturday is the reward for this @entity24 team -- a game in which no doubt it will be written off once again			0
but for now @entity10 's players will do what they 've done from the very start			1
they 'll " think big			0

@entity10 defeats @entity38 5 - 3 on penalties
@entity69 the man to miss from the spot
@entity158 gave @entity10 48th minute lead
@entity245 netted a dramatic late *equalizer*
