@entity0 , @entity1 -- the lush , green forests of central @entity4 have long been the playground and refuge of the continent 's most - notorious warlord , @entity7			1
his @entity9 , which began with the aim of overthrowing the @entity13 government , has since spread to remote hinterlands on the borders of the @entity1 , @entity16 and the @entity17			1
though officials do n't know exactly where @entity7 is , @entity19 troops have been sent to the area to help find and defeat the @entity9 leader			1
but as @entity2 has learned , much work remains to be done -- both to locate @entity7 and to restore a sense of stability and safety to the region			1
" @entity7 is definitely still a threat			1
he 's been on the run			2
he 's on the decline , and in survival mode , but he is still dangerous and he 's going to be dangerous until the @entity9 are eliminated , " said a captain with @entity33			1
the captain , who @entity2 agreed not to identify because of concerns for his safety , spoke in @entity0 , a village in the @entity1			2
president @entity39 directed the deployment of about 100 troops to @entity4 last year to help hunt down leaders of the @entity9			1
distributed among four operating bases , they are advising regional forces			2
" we help our partner nation forces ask the right questions -- the who , the what , the when , the where and the why -- to get all the information , " the captain said			0
the @entity9 has been on the run since being scattered from a temporary base in @entity17 territory by a botched 2008 @entity19 - backed attack on @entity7 's position , dubbed @entity59			1
since then , @entity9 attacks have killed 2,400 people and displaced 465,000 , according to @entity62 , a nonprofit group that monitors @entity9 activity			1
another 3,400 people have been abducted			0
@entity7 , who became a household name when a video about him went viral on the @entity67 this year , is wanted by the @entity68 for crimes against humanity			1
he and his group are accused of killing and maiming villagers , abducting children and turning them into soldiers or sex slaves			0
@entity76 is considered one of the lucky ones			0
she was abducted by @entity9 soldiers , but released into the forest once they reached their base camp , she said			1
miraculously -- exhausted and terrified -- she made her way home			0
many of those taken with her were never seen or heard from again			0
part of the difficulty in tracking @entity7 stems from the fact he can move freely across porous borders , and not all countries in the region have joined the chase , said @entity13 armed forces spokesman col. @entity93			1
he believes @entity7 is shuffling between @entity16 and the @entity1			1
" this is the strategy that he has used for the last four to five years			0
when the pressure is too much here , he runs across the border because he knows we are not allowed to go after him , " @entity93 said			0
" whenever pressure is high , he just switches to north @entity16			0
" but a spokesman for the @entity105 information ministry denied the allegation			0
" this is completely incorrect , " said @entity107			0
" we do n't accommodate rebels from @entity13 or elsewhere			0
... the @entity9 has no existence in our areas			1
" regardless of where @entity7 is , the hope is that the search to find him will not only lead to his capture , but also bring an end to the long , regional nightmare he unleashed			2
despite the presence of troops , some people in @entity0 say they are still too afraid to sleep in their beds			2
they sleep in the yard , hiding in the undergrowth outside their houses , because they worry the @entity9 will come for them in the night			2
reclaiming peoples ' lives from that fear is as much a part of the job as capturing @entity7 , said the @entity33 captain			2
" i think this mission is a very worthwhile one , and it 's going to bring stability to a region that has been without stability for a long time			0
if we can do anything to help reduce the atrocities , and make the locals feel safe , then , i think , it 's definitely worthwhile , " he said			0
