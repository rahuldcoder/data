@entity0 -- the @entity2 has ruled the federal government may not deny funds from its global @entity6 program to organizations that refuse to actively oppose prostitution			1
in a 6 - 2 decision on thursday , the justices determined the policy requiring fund recipients adhere to a larger message about fighting disease and its root causes was not directly related to the " core " mandate of the @entity18 program			2
chief justice @entity20 , who wrote the opinion for the majority , said the 2003 law violated the @entity24			1
the ruling tosses out the policy			2
the case was closely watched by many @entity28 - based non-governmental organizations that distribute financial and other assistance overseas			1
the decision comes as the justices work toward wrapping up a busy term , likely next week			0
among the big issues yet to be resolved : affirmative action in college admissions ; federal enforcement of the @entity37 ; and the politically blockbuster constitutionality of same - sex marriage			0
the court next meets in public session to release decisions on monday			0
looking at the case decided on thursday , the @entity43 was designed to " make the reduction of hiv / aids behavioral risks a priority of all prevention efforts			1
" in addition to promoting abstinence , monogamy , counseling , and the use of condoms , the law sought to use @entity28 funds to " educate men and boys about the risks of procuring sex commercially " as well as finding ways to help " commercial sex workers " themselves get out of the business			1
federal money came with two conditions , including the " @entity66 " -- a ban on " assistance to any group or organization that does not have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking			2
" several groups objected to what they called a " loyalty oath , " including the @entity28 - based @entity77 and @entity78			1
@entity20 said the policy could not be sustained			1
" the ( requirement ) compels as a condition of federal funding the affirmation of a belief that by its nature can not be confined within the scope of the government program , " he wrote			2
" in doing so , it violates the @entity24 and can not be sustained			2
" explaining further , @entity20 noted in most cases " if a party objects to a condition on receipt of federal funding , its recourse is to decline the funds			1
" but the ruling concluded the law improperly prevented aid recipients from disavowing the the government 's wishes when spending its own money			0
" the ( requirement ) goes beyond preventing recipients from using private funds in a way that would undermine the federal program			0
it requires them to pledge allegiance to the government 's policy of eradicating prostitution , " @entity20 wrote			1
the anti-prostitution pledge in the law would still apply to organizations based outside the @entity28 receiving @entity28 funds			1
justices @entity116 and @entity118 dissented			0
justice @entity119 had earlier recused herself from the case , because she had supervised the government 's legal response when she was the @entity123 's solicitor general under president @entity124 from 2009 - 2010			0
@entity125 , president of the @entity126 , said there is " no place for discrimination " today			0
" discriminatory policies like the anti-prostitution pledge keep us from ever getting ahead of @entity133 , " @entity125 said			0
the case is @entity135 ( 12 - 10 ) .			0
