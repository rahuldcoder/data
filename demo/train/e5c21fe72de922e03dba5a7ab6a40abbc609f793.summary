-- photographer @entity1 takes us on a grand tour of the very best @entity5 religious architecture in form / @entity6			1
from @entity8 and @entity11 's @entity10 churches to @entity13 's austere concrete to the far - out experiments of @entity15 , the series is a beautiful study of how religion has long spawned many of the world 's most beautiful buildings			1
" i was always in awe of how light and a few building materials like concrete , glass and wood can evoke a spiritual feeling , " says @entity1 , who was drawn to the beauty of churches after experiencing the " very cathedral - like feel " of @entity11 's @entity24 at @entity25			1
the structures he documented are full of vaulted ceilings , soaring cantilevers and manipulated light , all of which are meant to enrapture believers			0
but @entity1 , who describes himself as agnostic , says he 's not trying to sell anyone on the merits of religion			1
he simply wants to provide reverent and referential descriptions of the buildings			0
" i try to keep my photography as distinct as i can from personal interpretations , " says the photographer , whose exposures can be as long as 45 minutes in some of the darkened cathedrals			0
in all , @entity1 photographed 17 places of worship with his @entity51 — 10 large format film camera			2
all but @entity53 in @entity54 , @entity55 , are in the @entity56			0
in every case , @entity1 says , clergy and custodians were proud to welcome him in			2
" these ecclesiastical buildings were the most accessible interiors that i ever photographed , " he says			1
" rarely , have i encountered more cooperative or welcoming people			0
" while photographing at the @entity56 @entity65 cadet chapelâ € ” a bustling tourist spotâ € ” the minister barred anyone from entering during @entity1 ' eight - minute exposure			1
of all of the houses of worship he visited , @entity1 ' favorite is the @entity72 in @entity73 , @entity74 , designed by @entity75			2
it 's a monumental space that brings the forest into the church			0
initially , @entity1 was dissatisfied with his first photograph , but second and third attempts achieved an image that reflected the soul - stirring flood of light within			1
@entity1 ' image of @entity86 ( slide 10 ) is publicly shown here for the first time			2
form / @entity6 is not yet finished			0
like the buildings he photographs , @entity1 wants the project to be grand			2
plus , there 's much more religious architecture to be explored			1
" it 's time to continue and get the funding together , " he says			0
