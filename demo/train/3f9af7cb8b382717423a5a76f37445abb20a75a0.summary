-- @entity1 , the infant whose family refused to accept a recommendation by a @entity5 hospital to remove the boy 's breathing tube and allow him to die , is now breathing on his own without the aid of a mechanical ventilator			1
the family flew back to their home in @entity13 , @entity14 , on thursday , one month after receiving a tracheotomy at a children 's hospital in @entity17			1
" by providing him with this common palliative procedure , we 've given @entity1 the chance to go home and be with his family after spending so much of his young life in the hospital			1
" said dr. @entity27 , chief of pediatrics for @entity29			0
the 15 - month - old , widely known in the media as " @entity1 , " became the center of an international end - of - life debate when a @entity33 , @entity14 hospital where he was receiving care for a progressive neurological disease refused to insert a tracheotomy , a surgical procedure in which an opening is made into the airway through an incision in the neck and allows for suction of fluid out of the lungs			1
in court papers , doctors in @entity5 said there was no hope for recovery			0
they would not perform a tracheotomy because they considered it to be invasive and not recommended for patients who require a long - term breathing machine			1
the family refused to accept the recommendation			2
the @entity59 ' daughter , @entity58 , had died at home in 2002 with a tracheotomy after suffering similar complications , and the family wanted to offer the same care to their son			2
the @entity1 case caught the attention of the group @entity68 , which funded @entity1 's transfer and treatment at the @entity71			1
that hospital deemed the procedure medically appropriate and @entity1 underwent a tracheotomy there on march 21			1
@entity76 , national director of @entity68 , said he considers this a " victory over the culture of death			0
" he says " [ @entity1 ] has gained benefit from his tracheotomy , is breathing on his own , and is going home to live with his parents			1
" @entity68 is a catholic pro-life organization which functions as a network to prevent abortion and euthanasia			0
they are often noted for the graphic images depicting abortion they use to make their case			0
the @entity90 -- the hospital where @entity1 was initially treated -- responded on march 23 that " there are clearly differences in the approach of these centres to the management of end - of - life care in this tragic situation " and that " the medical judgments made by @entity101 physicians remain unchallenged by any credible medical source			1
" on thursday , the hospital said it " has no new comments from those already provided in our previous media statements			2
" after arriving in @entity5 on thursday morning , the child was examined by a team of physicians at the @entity110 to ensure no complications or infections resulted from the flight			0
according to the hospital 's president and ceo , @entity117 , the @entity59 are prepared to take care of their son , but they also will be provided round - the - clock nursing care in their home			2
a team of community care nurses will alternate shifts staying with the family			0
they will take the lead on daily requirements , to include cleaning the trach , tube feeding and administering anti-anxiety medications			2
the nurses will also monitor his heart rate , suction secretions that build up in his lungs and provide oxygen as needed			0
according to @entity117 , the 24 - hour nursing care , medications and all the equipment are provided free of charge under @entity5 's universal health care system			0
in the @entity142 , hospice care is underutilized even though it tends to be less expensive than hospitalization and provides more comfort to the patient			0
estimates find approximately 60 % of all deaths occur in the hospital , yet most patients express a preference to die at home			2
it is unclear at this point just how much time the @entity59 have left with their son			0
in a phone conversation , @entity76 said @entity1 's symptoms are much more benign than those suffered by his sister			1
" it 's really an unpredictable condition , " he said			0
" our mission to save @entity1 was never based on any prediction of the future , but rather on the value of his life here and now			1
