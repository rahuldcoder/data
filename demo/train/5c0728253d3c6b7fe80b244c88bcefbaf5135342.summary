-- humans have always looked to birds for joy , inspiration and comfort , but if we look toward the birds of the @entity8 today , we feel no comfort , only a deep and growing unease			2
what began on april 20 with the horrific loss of 11 human lives in the explosion of the offshore oil rig @entity16 now threatens to become a devastating and far - reaching environmental disaster -- one that should shake the @entity21 people to our very core			1
hour by hour , a massive oil slick is spreading to the fragile coastal wetlands and barrier islands of the @entity26 in @entity27			1
coastal areas of @entity26 , @entity29 and @entity30 are also at risk			1
birds are key indicators of the environment in which they -- and we -- live and eat and breathe			2
their health or decline eventually mirrors our own , and the diagnosis this week is n't looking very good			0
the spreading oil threatens " @entity49 , " sites identified by @entity44 and other conservation experts as vital to the health or even the survival of entire species			1
coastal bird species -- graceful terns , gangly pelicans , peaceful plovers -- have everything to lose if the oil reaches them			1
it is breeding season for these year - round coastal denizens , and it is also peak migration season for millions of other birds headed north , right through the areas that may be hardest hit			1
a host of well - known species are at risk , among them : @entity65 , the state bird of @entity27 , are incubating eggs on barrier islands			1
the species was removed from the endangered species list late last year -- a victory to be sure -- but nevertheless faces an uncertain future			2
@entity74 egret , a tall , colorful bird that " dances " wildly in the surf as it hunts for prey , is a scarce denizen of warm , salty coasts			0
royal terns , and several of their relatives , nest on beaches and dunes and catch small fish by executing spectacular plunge - dives into the waters of the @entity8			2
but a dive into oily water could prove deadly for these beautiful creatures			0
mottled ducks , locally called " summer ducks " because they are the only ducks that breed along the @entity8 , living , feeding and nesting in coastal salt marshes where oil would have devastating consequences			1
@entity103 sparrows , tiny and secretive marsh birds , will have nowhere to go if the salt marsh edges they frequent are destroyed by oil			1
they would simply fade away			0
why does it matter if birds are in trouble ? like most @entity21 , i believe that living things have intrinsic worth and should be celebrated and allowed to thrive			1
they add beauty and wonder to our world			0
but if that does n't convince you , consider this : if birds are in trouble , so are we			1
the problem is simply too big to contain			0
birds and marine life will die			2
sensitive habitats will be damaged			0
industries and families will suffer			0
@entity129 will cost billions and take months or even years			0
long - term recovery is uncertain			1
we commend the federal , state and industry personnel who are working long hours in difficult and dangerous conditions attempting to stop and contain the spill			2
however , everyone shares the sickening realization that even heroic efforts probably will not be enough to avert significant environmental damage			0
this disaster confronts us squarely with the risks to which we expose ourselves and our environment any time we drill for oil			1
as a nation , we must stop and consider what we 've done , and what we will do tomorrow			0
we must pause and reflect on what places can truly be considered " safe " for oil extraction , having the courage to recognize that in some , the risks are simply too great and the resources too precious to spoil			0
elected representatives must keep the picture of this spreading catastrophe in mind as they consider the path to our energy future			2
@entity21 's energy needs are great			2
but so is our concern for the people and nature imperiled by our addiction to fossil fuel			0
it 's time to redouble our efforts to move toward a future powered by cleaner , renewable sources of energy that make the planet a safer place for us and all the life with which we share it			1
the images from the @entity8 are tragic reminders that we can not afford to wait			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity181 .			0

offshore oil rig explosion may produce long - term environmental devastation
massive oil slick threatens coastal @entity27 , @entity26 , @entity29 and @entity30
@entity188 : if birds are in trouble , so are we
@entity188 : " it 's time to *...* move toward a future powered by cleaner , renewable sources of energy "
