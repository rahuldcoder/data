-- the stadium lights are on , the outfield is mowed , and the beer taps are primed for their first pour			0
the @entity5 regular season is about to begin			0
it 's so close , you can taste it -- and it 's not all peanuts and @entity10			0
each of the 30 teams in the league has a clubhouse chef fueling the players , preparing meals for the home and away teams during the season			2
@entity20 , 37 , who describes himself as a die - hard @entity22 fan and " the one starting the wave , " is the clubhouse chef for the @entity22			1
but the way he got the gig required a few extra practice swings			0
more than a decade ago , @entity20 and a few buddies made their way to the clubhouse after the game to seek out players ' autographs			1
what he found instead was a revolting spread of food			0
" no way , i could n't believe my heroes were eating food like this , " recalled @entity20 , a graduate of the @entity37 at @entity38			2
as he quickly found out , fans were n't technically allowed into the clubhouse without proper credentials			0
as @entity20 was escorted out , he passed @entity46 , the clubhouse manager , and took his shot , handing gilbert his business card			1
@entity20 never heard from him			2
taking matters into his own hands , he started coming down to the stadium to bring the team food			0
he kept coming back ... and back ... and back			0
" if you leave me alone , i 'll let you cook dinner , " @entity46 finally told @entity20 right before the demolition of the old @entity55 stadium			2
it was finally the young chef 's turn to step up to the plate			0
he maxed out his credit card , preparing steak and lobster and even bringing out an ice sculpture			2
after that dinner , the @entity22 hired @entity20			1
he 's now in his 11th season and watches every home game at @entity68 on an 8 - inch television in the clubhouse kitchen			1
@entity20 cooks not only for the big hitters but for the umpires , the wives and the kids , usually 60 to 70 people a game			1
his off - season catering company , @entity76 , cooks for the visiting teams at @entity68			0
albeit a chef , @entity20 is first and foremost a fan			2
and like any devoted baseball enthusiast , @entity20 does n't dismiss the superstitions that have long intertwined with the national pastime			0
there 's the @entity83 and those players who do n't step on the foul line on the way to bat , but have you heard the one about @entity90 and the wings ? @entity90 , a native of @entity92 , came to play for the @entity22 in 2001			1
in an effort to bring the cuisine of @entity92 to the home field , @entity20 served @entity92 chicken wings to the player on one of his first days			1
@entity90 went on to have an incredible year , ultimately being named @entity99			0
@entity90 now eats those wings at 5:05 p.m. , on the same plate , from the same pan , every single game			1
@entity104 fancies a nice juicy steak , and @entity106 prefers fettucine alfredo -- that is , until the nutritionist came along two years ago , forcing players to eat more healthily			1
@entity20 's beloved deep fryer struck out , though he admits he occasionally trafficks a corn dog from the stadium for player who wishes to remain anonymous			0
when word spread that the first item blacklisted by the nutritionist was dark - meat chicken , @entity20 's cell phone rang			1
it was one of the overlords at the @entity22 : " @entity90 gets 200 hits a year , so he eats whatever he wants			1
" for now , @entity90 still gets his plate of teriyaki wings at 5:05			1
( the @entity22 open the season against the @entity127 on april 5 at @entity128			0

@entity20 , a die - hard @entity22 fan , also cooks for team
he kept bringing meals to clubhouse until manager hired him
@entity90 eats chicken wings on same plate from same pan every game
@entity104 fancies a nice juicy steak on game day
