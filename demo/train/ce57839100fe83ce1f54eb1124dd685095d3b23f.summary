@entity1 portraits have emerged of the police officer at the center of the controversy surrounding the death of @entity7 in @entity8 during an attempted arrest in july			1
defenders of officer @entity11 say he is an upstanding former boy scout with few complaints against him			1
critics say he should have been indicted for his role in @entity7 's death and point to two lawsuits against him as signs that his record as an officer is tarnished			1
police union officials describe him in glowing terms , saying he is no hothead			1
" he 's a model of what we want a police officer to be , " said @entity26 , president of the @entity27			1
" he 's a mature , mature police officer , motivated by serving the community			1
he literally is an @entity33			0
" @entity34 has had " very few citizen complaints " against him over the course of more than 300 arrests , according to union spokesman @entity37			1
but court records show he has been sued at least twice , both times on allegations of false arrest and unlawful imprisonment			0
one suit was brought by two men from @entity8 , @entity46 and @entity47 , who alleged that @entity34 arrested them in 2012 on baseless charges , and humiliated them in public			0
they claimed that on the street , during an arrest on drug suspicions , @entity34 and another officer " pulled down the plaintiffs ' pants and underwear , and touched and searched their genital areas , or stood by while this was done in their presence			2
" lawyers for the officers denied the charges , saying they acted reasonably and exercised their discretion			0
but they reached a settlement in the case , for $ 30,000 , according to the plaintiffs ' lawyers			0
the other suit , filed this year , has not yet been resolved			0
in that case , @entity69 accuses @entity34 and another police officer of approaching , accosting , falsely arresting and falsely imprisoning him on marijuana possession charges in february 2012			1
@entity69 says the charges were later dropped			0
the arrest , the lawsuit says , was " part of a pattern of false arrests and civil rights violations against persons of color " by police			2
according to the police union , @entity34 comes from a family of public servants : his father is a retired @entity87 firefighter , and his uncle was an officer with the @entity89			1
he went to monsignor @entity90 in @entity8 , then got a bachelor 's degree from the @entity93			2
he joined the force in 2006 , working his way up from a " condition unit , " where he enforced quality - of - life crimes , to assignments in narcotics enforcement and then in an anti-crime unit			0
he is now 29 and single , with no children			0
on wednesday , a grand jury decided not to indict @entity34 for his role in @entity7 's death -- a controversial decision that 's sparked protests in @entity87 and across the country			2
@entity7 died in july after @entity34 put him in a chokehold			0
a medical examiner ruled the death of homicide			0
and after the chokehold , @entity87 's police commissioner announced that officers would undergo a three - day retraining period on the proper use of force when engaging a suspect			1
" i feel very bad about the death of mr. @entity7 , " @entity11 said wednesday in a statement			1
" my family and i include him and his family in our prayers and i hope that they will accept my personal condolences for their loss			0
" but the widow of @entity7 , @entity133 , said wednesday night that @entity34 should be held accountable for her husband 's death			2
" he 's still working , he 's still getting a paycheck , " she said , " and my husband is six feet under and i 'm looking for a way to feed my kids now			2
" and @entity7 's mother , @entity140 , told @entity2 's @entity141 thursday night that @entity34 " has no regard for human life , if this is the way he treats suspects			2
" @entity34 still faces an internal review by the @entity89 , and a federal civil rights investigation , so it is unclear if he will be allowed to return to policing			0
in the recent high - profile incident in @entity152 , where teenager @entity153 was killed during a contentious encounter with a policeman , the officer involved was not indicted but nevertheless resigned from the job , saying he could not be effective after the public controversy			1
but former @entity87 police commissioner @entity158 says @entity34 does not necessarily have to follow that precedent			2
unlike @entity161 , which is a very small department , there are over 35,000 police officers in @entity87 in a city of 8 million people , " he said			0
" i believe that if officer @entity11 is found to be retained with the @entity168 , he could continue in police work , yes			1
" but even if @entity34 were cleared , police union president @entity26 says , " this death will never go away from him			1
it will always be in the back of his mind			0
