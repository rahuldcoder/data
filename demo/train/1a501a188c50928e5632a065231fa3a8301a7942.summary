-- when the average person contemplates the issues surrounding landfills , it 's doubtful they give much consideration to the tons of food that fill them			2
food biodegrades so where is the problem ? the problem , environmentalists say , is just that			0
when food rots , it releases methane , a greenhouse gas which the @entity20 @entity19 ( @entity19 ) says is 20 times more damaging to the environment than carbon dioxide ( @entity22 )			1
rotting food in a landfill in @entity25 , @entity26			2
the developed world chucks out a lot of food			0
such is the volume that according to the @entity20 @entity32 ( @entity32 ) , if just 5 percent of @entity20 ' food scraps were recovered it would represent one day 's worth of food for 4 million people			1
the @entity36 offers another way of looking at it : it says the total surplus of the @entity20 alone could satisfy " every empty stomach " in @entity44 ( @entity46 's leftovers could feed the @entity47 ; and @entity41 's could feed @entity42 's undernourished )			1
proportionately , the @entity48 and @entity49 have traditionally been among the worst offenders worldwide in recent years when it comes to food waste , discarding between 30 and 40 percent of their food produce annually			1
the figures for how much the @entity20 throws out , however , vary considerably depending on whom you ask			2
according to the @entity32 , just over a quarter of the country 's food -- about 25.9 million tons -- gets thrown in the garbage can every year			2
but according to a study conducted by the @entity64 , that figure could be as high as 50 percent , as the @entity64 claims that the country 's supermarkets , restaurants and convenience stores alone throw out 27 million tons between them every year ( representing $ 30 billion of wasted food )			1
either way , it still costs the @entity20 around $ 1 billion every year just to dispose of all its food waste , according to the @entity19			1
but moral and economic issues aside , it is the environmental concerns around food waste that is driving the push for reform on how to treat the problem of leftovers			1
methane , the gas food waste produces , traps 23 times as much heat in the atmosphere as the same amount of @entity22 , the @entity19 says			1
and landfills are the place you will find most of it -- they account for 34 percent of all methane emissions in the @entity20 the @entity64 believes that if @entity20 cut their food waste in half , it would reduce the country 's environmental impact by 25 percent			1
the @entity48 's @entity93 ( @entity94 ) -- which says the entire food supply chain in the @entity48 contributes 20 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions -- believes that if we stopped throwing out edible food , the impact it would have on @entity22 emissions would be the equivalent of taking 1 in 5 cars off the road			1
but ironically , one of the solutions to dealing with food waste actually results in a product that could keep cars on the road : biogas			2
biogas is a by - product of a process called anaerobic digestion ( @entity114 )			0
@entity114 is a process where organic matter -- such as food waste -- breaks down in an environment with little or no oxygen , generating a natural gas made up of 60 percent methane and 40 percent @entity22			1
it is the exact process , in fact , which goes on in landfills			0
but there is a difference			0
whereas methane can be harmful to the environment in an open setting , such as a landfill , in controlled and closed settings such as a combined heat and power plant , it can be harnessed and converted into biogas , a renewable energy			2
and that energy can be used to provide heat , light and fuel			2
according to a study by the @entity142 , biogas - fueled cars can reduce co2 emissions by anything from 75 percent to 200 percent compared to cars powered by fossil fuels			0
most organic matter can be processed with @entity114			0
in the @entity48 it is already being used to treat sewage , which @entity151 ( @entity152 ) says , reduces co2 emissions by 16 percent compared to traditional sewage treatments			0
according to the @entity155 , gas from sewage waste and landfills is already being used to provide 650 mw of electricity to the @entity48 's national grid , representing between 60 and 75 percent of the country 's green energy ( the @entity48 is @entity164 's biggest producer of biogas )			1
however , while the potential for food waste - as - energy seems big , the practical applications for it are currently very small ( only 0.4 percent of the @entity48 's food waste is processed by @entity114 , for example ) , with critics of @entity114 pointing out that the amount food waste can contribute to the energy supply are negligible to say the least			1
@entity152 itself admits that just 0.36 percent of the @entity48 's electricity needs could be met by @entity114			0
and , if 5.5 million tons of food waste was treated by @entity114 ( the majority of the @entity48 's annual 6.7 million tons of food waste ) it could only generate enough electricity to power 164,000 houses			1
that being said , environmentalists will say , that 's much better than getting that electricity from fossil fuels			0
and there has been a big push , in @entity164 in particular , to cut back on the amount of biodegradable waste that is being sent to landfills			0
according to the @entity193 , the amount of biodegradable waste sent to landfills in member countries by 2020 must reach 35 percent of the levels reached in 1995			0
the country that is leading the way in putting its biodegradable waste mountains to good use -- particularly in the world of biogas - powered cars -- is @entity203			0
that country -- which plans to eliminate petrol and diesel vehicles from their streets by 2020 -- already has 7,000 biogas cars on the road			0
it also has 779 biogas buses and the world 's first biogas train , which , according to @entity214 , cost just 1 million euros ( $ 1.4 million ) to develop			2

5 percent of @entity20 's leftovers could feed 4 million people for 1 day
disposing of food waste costs the @entity20 $ 1 billion a year
rotting food releases methane , a more potent greenhouse gas than co2
methane can be harnessed to create clean energy for heat , light and fuel
