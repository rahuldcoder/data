-- as tensions escalate on the eastern border of @entity4 , president @entity1 has called on @entity6 president @entity5 and his government " to cease all efforts to undermine and destabilize " the sovereign nation after the movement of @entity6 troops into @entity4 and its annexing of @entity13			1
meanwhile , our @entity15 allies continue round - the - clock conversations as the political leadership in @entity19 is seemingly helpless to stave off the next potential military land grab			0
this is the backdrop to a legislative endeavor in @entity19 that , although widely unreported in the @entity23 , will fundamentally reshape the world community 's dialogue on the @entity4 crisis			2
two of @entity4 's leading political parties , " fatherland " and " strike , " have jointly introduced a bill in @entity32 that calls for the rejection of the country 's 1994 accession to the 1968 @entity36			2
@entity6 's disregard of international law , its apparent successful theft of @entity13 and @entity4 's desperate attempt at self - preservation may result in the end of one of the last century 's most important diplomatic milestones , the @entity36 , and with it , the efforts of a generation to walk back the spread of nuclear weapons			1
infographic : a divided @entity4 a new global nuclear arms race may soon begin , and the world will have @entity5 to thank			1
in 1994 , @entity4 , the @entity6 , the @entity53 and the @entity54 entered into an agreement to remove former @entity57 nuclear weapons from @entity4 , later known as the @entity58			1
@entity4 agreed to sign the @entity36			0
in the history of nuclear weapons , only four states have ever walked away from nuclear capabilities : three post-soviet states ( @entity4 , @entity64 and @entity65 ) and @entity66 , which had covertly developed a nuclear weapons arsenal			0
@entity4 's actions were not without significant commitments , however , by the other signatories			2
@entity6 , the @entity53 and the @entity54 pledged in part " to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of @entity4 " and " reaffirm their obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of @entity4			1
" today , @entity6 's policies and actions toward @entity4 's @entity13 region demonstrate complete disregard for this critically important memorandum and international law			1
as a response , some within the @entity4 government are looking beyond an immediate call for @entity23 help to a more proactive means of guaranteeing their national security , i.e. regaining nuclear weapons status			0
opinion : goodbye , good luck to @entity4 ? the recently introduced legislation is the latest expression of the growing sentiment that a nuclear @entity4 is a protected @entity4			0
@entity101 , a member of the @entity32 since 1998 , recently said he had spoken directly with @entity5 and told him that because of @entity6 's breaking of the @entity58 , " such arrangements will not be trusted by anyone anymore , and that each country that has financial capacity to acquire its own nuclear weapons will be aspired to go down that path , and @entity4 is no exception			1
" in addition , former minister of foreign affairs @entity110 recently said , " @entity4 needs to announce that it is walking away from the npt and immediately restart the full nuclear cycle and manufacturing of all the components of the weapons			0
" ironically , the notion of reacquiring nuclear weapons as a security guarantee is a position publicly advocated by @entity5 himself : " if you can not count on international law , then you must find other ways to ensure your security			2
... this is logical : if you have the bomb , no one will touch you			0
" these words were written by @entity5 to the @entity53 people in the context of @entity53 policy toward @entity133 in a @entity135 opinion piece from september 11			0
opinion : @entity53 giving @entity5 green light in @entity4 ? today , less than six months later , @entity5 's decision to disregard a critical agreement in violation of international law -- and in disregard of his own logic -- has set in motion a discussion that could have dire security implications on the @entity147 , in @entity148 , in @entity149 and anywhere nations are weighing the nuclear option for their security posture			1
the actions of @entity6 and @entity4 over the next few weeks have the potential to alter the global nuclear weapons dynamic in a profound and extremely dangerous way			1
one probable and immediate consequence of a @entity4 choice to " go nuclear " would be that @entity64 , a @entity4 neighbor and close @entity161 ally , would also choose to return to its pre-treaty nuclear weapons status through the development of indigenous weapons or , even more likely , invite the placement of @entity6 nuclear weapons within its borders			2
given @entity64 ' borders with @entity171 member states @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174 , this would probably lead to @entity171 and @entity176 reactions and a reversal of @entity15 nuclear stability trends not seen since the @entity36 entered into force in march 1970			0
@entity5 has sent a clear message to the more than 25 non-nuclear states possessing the technical capabilities to join the nuclear weapons club that the stick of nuclear arms and not the carrot of international law is what guarantees national security			2
in the @entity135 , he wrote , " preserving law and order in today 's complex and turbulent world is one of the few ways to keep international relations from sliding into chaos			0
the law is still the law , and we must follow it whether we like it or not			0
" it should be the hope of every nation that the crisis in @entity4 is quickly and peacefully resolved and that @entity5 takes his own words to heart , reversing a course that leads to a world where the phrase " nuclear arms race " is not relegated only to the past .			1

three *scholars* fear that @entity6 actions in @entity4 may force new nuclear dynamic
a new global arms race may begin , and world will have @entity5 to thank , they argue
*authors* : disregard of law may end one of last century 's most important diplomatic agreements
