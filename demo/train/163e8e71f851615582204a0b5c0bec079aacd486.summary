-- for most people , breaking one world record would suffice			1
but for @entity5 , rewriting history a second time is n't quite enough			2
last month , the @entity7 speed skier set a new world record of 252.4 kilometers per hour ( 156.8 miles per hour ) on the slopes of @entity10 in the @entity11 , beating his previous best of 251.4 km / h ( 156.2 mph ) set at @entity13 in november 2006			1
now , the 34 - year - old is gearing up to go even faster			1
" i have already started to plan my next world record , next year , same place , " @entity5 told @entity0			1
" if the conditions are perfect -- temperature , wind , snow -- i can be as fast as 254 or 255 km / h ( 158.4 mph )			2
" he might be already masterminding his next world - record attempt , but @entity5 is still coming to terms with the magnitude of his record - breaking achievements			1
" it was the best day of my life ! to set a new record once is cool			2
but to do it twice is absolutely great			0
i 'm really happy with that after waiting for eight years , " said @entity5			2
" it 's my passion for the sport			0
speed skiing is my life			1
i spend hours in the gym and on the slopes , working on my technique			0
i try to improve my aerodynamics in the wind tunnel and then the mental aspect is absolutely key			0
losing your focus for a split second can be fatal			0
" born in the city of @entity43 in 1979 , @entity5 hails from a family with skiing in its blood			2
younger brother @entity47 , 27 , is also one of the world 's top speed skiers , setting a junior world record of 250.7 km / h ( 155.7 mph ) in 2006 , and also took part at @entity52 last month			1
the older sibling first took to the slopes at the age of three under the tutelage of his father , an experienced coach , and made headway in downhill racing as a teenager before turning his hand to speed skiing in 2003 -- a sport that complimented his daredevil tendencies to a tee			1
" it 's a very strong feeling			0
after five seconds you 're already at 200 km / h ( 124.2 mph ) on a slope that is up to 98 % steep -- that 's amazing , " he said			2
" it 's impossible to win a race if you 're afraid			0
certainly my body and mind tell me you should n't be doing this			0
but in order to be fast you have to overcome your fear and force yourself to go down there			0
" that need for speed will have @entity5 coming back to @entity10 next april , when the @entity7 will be praying for perfect conditions to maximize his chances of breaking his own world record for the second time			1
" it 's all down to the conditions			0
the snow has to be perfect to break the world record			1
the latest record was only possible because we had spring snow in @entity94 ( in @entity52 )			0
in the three previous years the snow conditions were different and a world record was impossible , " he said			1
" there 's only one piste in the world that is long enough to break the world record ( @entity94 )			1
in order to reach over 200 km / h ( 124.2 mph ) the piste has to be long , without bumps and have a long finish area			2
" from now until next april , though , @entity5 will return to the day job , where he can be found juggling the roles of ski instructor , mountain guide and rescuer			0
for all that two speed skiing world records might bring you , prize money is not one of the luxuries afforded			1
" we do n't have prize money in our sport , it 's all about the passion , " he said			0
" you have to live for it			0
