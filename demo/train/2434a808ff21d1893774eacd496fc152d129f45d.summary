@entity0 -- most of us go about our daily business never thinking about the @entity6 @entity5 or the cases it decides			1
but sometimes , it gets a case so big -- and could affect your life so much -- you simply have to take notice			1
this week is one of those times			2
the highest court in the land is preparing to tackle perhaps the most important appeals to reach it in more than a decade : the massive health care reform legislation championed by president @entity20			1
the court will soon hear six hours of oral arguments over three days on the law 's constitutionality -- and your health and your finances could be on the line			1
their eventual rulings in an election year will not only guide how every @entity6 receives medical care but would also establish precedent - setting boundaries of government regulation over a range of social areas			1
" the implications in the health care litigation are impossible to overstate , " said @entity35 , a prominent @entity0 attorney and publisher of @entity37			1
" it has tremendous consequences for president @entity20 's re-election because it 's a signature achievement			1
but in terms of law , this case is really going to decide how much power @entity48 has to regulate spheres that we 've often thought of as the jobs of the states or of just individuals			1
" a century of federal efforts to offer universal health care culminated with the 2010 passage of the @entity58			2
after months of bare - knuckled fights over politics and policy , the legislation signed by @entity20 reached 2,700 pages , nine major sections and 450 some provisions			2
the @entity6 @entity5 : how it works the partisan debate around such a sweeping piece of legislation has encompassed traditional hot - button topics : abortion and contraception funding , state and individual rights , federal deficits , end - of - life - care and the overall economy			1
the high court now gets the final word			2
" these issues are really central to whether the federal government can regulate anything it wants to , or whether there are some things that only the state governments can regulate , " said @entity79 , the attorney who will argue against the law , on behalf of a coalition of 26 states			0
on the other side are progressives who back the @entity20 administration and its congressional supporters			0
" @entity48 thought it necessary to regulate the nearly 20 % of our nation 's economy that makes up the health care industry and to make sure insurance companies did not discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions , for example , " said @entity93 , chief counsel at the @entity94			1
" that is squarely within @entity48 ' authority			0
" your guide to the arguments debate comes down to four key issues despite its complexity , the high court has narrowed its focus to just four key issues : one : constitutionality of the individual mandate ( also known as the " minimum coverage " requirement ) , the key funding provision			1
two : whether the individual mandate is a " tax , " thereby limiting authority of the courts to immediately decide the mandate question			1
three : whether other parts of the law can survive if the mandate is struck down			1
four : federal vs. state conflict over expansion of the cooperative @entity130 program			0
it is the " individual mandate " that has sparked the most controversy			1
it requires nearly every @entity6 to purchase some level of insurance or face a tax penalty of up to about $ 700 a year			0
typical of the ideological divide , the opposing sides do not even agree on what the individual mandate was designed to accomplish			1
supporters see it a way of spreading health care costs to a larger pool of individuals , ensuring affordable , quality medical care			0
they say regulating commerce and the economy has long been a federal prerogative			0
health law supporter : ' it really is going to help the @entity6 public ' the @entity154 will tell the high court that since every @entity6 will need medical care at some point in their lives , individuals do not " choose " to participate in the health care market			1
federal officials cite 2008 figures of $ 43 billion in uncompensated costs from the millions of uninsured people who receive health services , costs that are shifted to insurance companies and passed on to consumers			0
health law opponent : ' @entity48 made a bad situation worse ' but opponents see a fundamental constitutional violation , an intrusion into citizens ' personal lives , forcing @entity6 to purchase a commercial product they might not want or need			0
the states equate such a requirement to a burdensome regulation of " inactivity			1
" one federal appeals court has found the act unconstitutional			1
two others have has said it is a proper exercise of congressional mandate			2
a third court has ruled against the states on technical grounds , saying local officials lack authority to even go into to court and argue the individual mandate issue			1
twenty - eight states and countless individuals and groups have sued the administration			0
what the reform is designed to do health care reform , a top @entity204 priority since the @entity206 administration , was passed by the previous @entity48 in a series of close party - line votes			2
@entity20 signed the act into law in march 2010			0
among other things , the measure was designed to help millions of uninsured and underinsured @entity6 receive adequate and affordable health care through a series of government - imposed mandates and subsidies			0
the federal government will tell the court that 45 million @entity6 last year lacked health insurance , roughly 15 % of the country 's population			2
critics have equated the measure to socialized medicine , fearing that a bloated government bureaucracy will result in higher taxes and diminished health care services			0
opponents derisively labeled the measure " @entity58			0
" @entity231 leaders , who captured the @entity232 in the 2010 midterm elections , have vowed to overturn or severely trim the law			0
all the major @entity231 candidates for president have echoed similar calls , especially in their tv campaign ads. that has concerned some liberal legal analysts			0
" it seems what the conservative state attorneys general and the governors were trying to do was seek a do - over of the act in the courts , to achieve what they could n't in the legislature			0
and it really has become a bit of political theater , " says @entity93			0
" if the @entity5 and especially some of the conservative justices uphold the mandate , and deliver the message to the tea party that their constitutional vision is fundamentally flawed , that makes it much harder for tea party candidates and their supporters to have their constitutional theories taken seriously by the @entity6 people			1
" @entity5 and election - year blockbusters but the states worry how far the federal government would go in the future , all in the name of regulating " commerce , " if the high court found the law constitutional			1
" i think about just a couple of years ago when the automobile industry was suffering , and @entity48 said : we 're going to give people incentives to buy new cars , " said @entity79			0
" well , it would have been even more effective and even better for the car industry if @entity48 had just said : if you make more than $ 100,000 , you need to buy a new car			0
they have n't done that , maybe it 's self - restraint , maybe it 's because the [ sweeping ] power really does n't exist			2
that 's really what the court is going to decide			2
" how the justices could rule the entire court of nine justices will hear the case , despite separate calls for @entity294 and @entity295 to recuse			2
they will have several options before them when issuing opinions in these cases			0
they could separately strike down or uphold the individual mandate and @entity130 provisions and rule whether the entire law must be scrapped			1
or they could declare a legal " time - out " -- concluding the constitutional questions must be postponed until the major provisions go into effect in 2014 , when any real " harm " from the financial mandates would presumably be felt			0
two families , two viewpoints on health reform the opportunity to rule on a landmark case brings with it precedent - setting opportunities to either expand or deflate not only the power of @entity48 and the executive but also the judiciary 's own prestige and authority			1
in some ways , it is a perilous path , since the courts have increasingly become a political football			0
" we 're in a little bit of a political death spiral for the @entity5 , as ideologues on the left and right attack justices with whom they disagree , maybe decreasing the public 's confidence in the @entity5 , " said @entity37 's @entity35			1
" and as they take up health care , abortion cases , immigration -- all of those issues -- there are going to be more excuses to attack the justices			0
" so expect nine unelected judges and the tricky issues such as health care they confront to be major talking points in this year 's state and federal elections			2
their votes could ultimately decide whom @entity6 choose on @entity351 2012			0
" our job on the court is to decide -- and control our stress , " justice @entity352 told @entity1 a couple of years ago while discussing how to manage -- personally and professionally -- the biggest , most politically explosive @entity5 appeals			1
" keep yourself under control			0
and do your best on the decision			0
" that 's wellness advice that could serve the nine - member bench -- and anyone passionately folllowing the case -- in the days to come			1
read more about the rulings for yourself the cases are @entity369 v. @entity370 ( 11 - 398 ) ; @entity371 ( 11 - 393 ) ; and @entity370 v. @entity369 of @entity369 ( 11 - 400 )			2
rulings are expected in june .			2

@entity5 prepares to tackle perhaps the most important appeals to reach it in more than a decade
rulings could establish precedents in regulation over a range of social areas
@entity37 editor : " the implications *...* are impossible to overstate "
constitutionality of the reform 's individual mandate is a key point of the case
