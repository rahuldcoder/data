@entity0 -- stars from one of the world 's great soccer teams will be encouraging reading as part of a new project to put one million digital books in the hands of @entity12 children			1
@entity14 football team @entity13 -- home to stars @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 -- joined forces thursday with the non-profit organization @entity23 in a campaign to inspire a wave of literacy in @entity27 through the use of e-readers			1
@entity30 : i 'm better than @entity17 founded by @entity32 , a former executive at @entity33 and @entity34 , @entity23 works on the premise that e-readers , like @entity34 's @entity37 , could help children in developing countries to " awaken their passion for reading , and improve their lives			2
" " @entity23 is committed to putting a digital library in the hands of all children throughout the world 's developing countries , and we 're thrilled with the support of @entity13 to send one million e-books to students in @entity27 , " said @entity32 , @entity23 's ceo			1
' @entity55 ' series finally available as e-books the campaign is appealing for one million donors to each make a $ 5 contribution to help them reach their target of distributing one million e-books to 10,000 children in @entity27			1
because students bring home the devices and typically share their use with family members , friends and neighbors , it is expected the initiative will help put e-books in the hands of 50,000 people			2
the e-readers will be distributed to children in @entity76 , @entity77 , and @entity78 , where the non-profit is already operating , and soon in @entity80 , which is to become the next focus for the organization			1
football giant @entity13 will lend its weight to the campaign , with its stars sending messages via the e-readers to encourage students to read more and achieve their goals			1
@entity23 believes technology can provide the best approach to encouraging literacy in parts of the developing world where books are otherwise scarce			0
unlike traditional books -- which had to be physically imported , one title at a time -- a single e-reader could provide a child with a vast array of current , relevant titles at a low distribution cost			2
the increased access to reading material , it was believed , could broaden the way students think and develop their creativity by allowing them to go beyond the syllabus to follow their reading interests			1
a year - long pilot of the program to 350 students in six schools in @entity76 yielded promising results			2
@entity118 test scores for primary students participating in the program increased by 4.8 % to 7.6 % more than their peers who were not taking part , although benefits for older students were less clear			0
the e-readers gave students access to a much greater variety of titles : 107 , on average , as opposed to the between 3 to 11 books the average student had access to at home without the devices			1
they swiftly learned how to use the e-readers , despite 43 % having never used a computer before			0

the students relished their access to " a wide variety of classic and cutting - edge literature by renowned authors , " she said			0
as e-readers provided a pathway into the digital world , many students also used them to read international news sites that would have been inaccessible previously			0
just one of the collateral benefits to the program was that students gained greater exposure to @entity12 writers , said @entity23 managing director and co-founder @entity167			0
the program was working with @entity12 publishing houses to digitize their titles and provide students with local , relevant content -- which had positive impacts on local literary cultures			0
" we want to digitize the curriculum , there 's a whole catalog of books you can digitize , " he said			0
" once you digitize them , you ca n't just sell them in @entity76 or @entity77 -- you have a global market			2
so this is the first time @entity12 culture can be exported seamlessly , globally			0
that has an enormous impact on the potential of @entity27 over time			0

football giant @entity13 is supporting a project to distribute 1 million e-books in @entity27
the project will see e-readers given to children in @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity80
it is believed the devices encourage literacy by providing students access to more titles
younger students in an e-reader pilot project in @entity76 performed better in reading tests
