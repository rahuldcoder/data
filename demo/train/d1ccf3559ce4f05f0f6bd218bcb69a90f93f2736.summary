-- extra ! extra ! ! @entity1 offered $ 50 million to play @entity2 again ! if you 've scanned the superhero sites lately , you 've inevitably read reports that @entity1 is being lured back to the batcave with a $ 50 meeellion offer to square off against @entity9 's superman in @entity10 ' @entity12 sequel			1
fans of @entity16 's @entity15 trilogy and @entity1 's dark portrayal of the @entity18 immediately rejoiced , convincing themselves that @entity1 's previous denials and his desire to pass the torch to another @entity2 could quickly be erased by cold hard cash			1
perhaps that will eventually be the case			0
the recent online buzz erupted after the @entity26 reported that " @entity1 is facing extraordinary pressure " to return to the character for a huge payday			1
the @entity26 's sources , however , are n't exactly @entity10 insiders or members of @entity1 's inner circle			1
instead , the tabloid was blindly relying on a new ebook titled beyond @entity2 : the @entity36 of @entity1 and his dark knight dilemma			1
it 's a 27 - page mini-book from an author named @entity40 , who 's also written an unauthorized biography of @entity43 superstar @entity42			0
@entity0 : @entity10 reveals plans for a @entity2 / @entity8 film at @entity46 in @entity2 , @entity40 writes about a @entity48 conversation about a potential @entity50 movie that he had with a friend who worked at @entity52 during the making of the @entity15 films : " ' why would @entity1 walk away from what is certainly going to be either the first or second highest grossing movie in the history of cinema , " he asked , when the subject of @entity50 was raised			1
... ' he could probably make $ 50 million for being in the movie 20 minutes , ' my friend observed			0
' and it would be worth every penny to the studio			0
' ... sources close to @entity1 have reportedly begun expressing their suspicions that @entity1 now views the @entity2 films in the same light that @entity70 views the @entity72 films			1
although @entity73 has appeared as @entity72 in four films in less than a decade , he 's hardly typecast as only @entity72			0
@entity73 has balanced his action film escapades with other projects that have harnessed his talents and earned critical acclaim in the process			0
... @entity1 's future success as a @entity82 draw may need @entity2 every bit as much as the @entity2 franchise needs @entity1 for a few more rounds			1
... it goes without saying that @entity1 's managers , friends , and representatives are all telling him the same			1
and as anyone who has ever worked with @entity1 will admit , the actor is incredibly sharp , business savvy , and perceptive			2
as a result , it seems highly unlikely that @entity1 will bolt from @entity2 when the bat signal is still glimmering above the @entity82 sign with such tangible fervor			1
" got all that ? a " former colleague " of @entity40 's told him seven months before @entity12 even opened in theaters that @entity1 could probably get $ 50 million for appearing in a subsequent @entity50 movie			1
now , let 's assume @entity40 's former colleague is a top @entity52 executive and that everything he said accurately reflects the company 's thinking ... that still does n't equate into what 's being reported by many outlets today			0
there is no $ 50 million offer , based on a speculative conversation that took place eight months ago			0
the confusion is n't necessarily the fault of @entity40 â € ” who relied on " exclusive interviews , online research " for his $ 2.99 ebook â € ” but the number of outlets that hurriedly ran with the news , most likely because of their steadfast belief that this type of announcement is inevitable			0
of course @entity10 is going to make a final push to get @entity1 back , goes the thinking			2
and $ 50 million seems about right ( i guess ? ) reportedly , director @entity131 wants a slightly older , wearier @entity2 to battle @entity9 's younger @entity8			2
that would be @entity1 , who 's only 39 , but he certainly pulled that off in @entity134			2
@entity10 and @entity1 's rep both declined to comment about the newest speculation , but that could mean anything or nothing			2
@entity0 : @entity131 looking for an older @entity2 ? for those who want to go down the rabbit - hole , @entity1 starts shooting @entity142 , his @entity143 epic with @entity144 , this fall , but he 's not yet officially booked for anything in early 2014 , when @entity2 vs. @entity8 is tentatively scheduled to shoot			1
so he 's potentially available			0
@entity1 also would n't be the first actor to feign disinterest in order to secure a better payday			2
he 's either completely content with walking away from the franchise , or he 's playing this non-negotiation negotiation perfectly			0
conceivably , he could return as @entity2 for one epic battle with @entity8 , really die the noble death he faked in @entity134 and then hand the keys of the @entity155 over to his new successor , played by @entity157 , for the subsequent @entity50 movie â € ” stop ! ! ! see , i understand why we care and why we were so willing to believe the $ 50 million offer report			2
but the fact is , @entity10 is still looking for its @entity2 , and last we heard from @entity1 on the matter , he said , " i enjoy looking forward to what somebody else will come up with			1
" admittedly , that was in july , but that was also seven months after the sketchy conversation that launched the $ 50 million rumor			0
