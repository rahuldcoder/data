-- in @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity2 agents -- guns drawn -- walked down the street near the home where the @entity9 bombing suspects lived			1
emergency vehicles lined the street , roads were cordoned off , and a suspicious red vehicle was towed from the scene			2
@entity14 , 29 , a doctorate student at the @entity15 , said it 's still sinking in that the suspects , whom he did n't personally know , lived directly across @entity19			1
" we were that close , " said @entity14 , who has lived there since september			2
" it 's not something you expect			2
" his roommate , @entity26 , 26 , said she 's been confused ever since police ordered her out of her home			1
" i 'm a bit worried			2
i never thought that this could happen here in @entity32 , " she said			2
many residents in the area awoke to federal agents with machine guns banging on their doors and the commands : " get out ! get out ! " despite the calls for evacuation , some residents sat on sidewalks near a perimeter of crime scene tape			1
others defied the commands to stay indoors and gathered to gawk as state and federal officers -- some in camouflage , most in flak vests -- canvassed the neighborhood			2
four miles west , in the suburb of @entity54 , many residents remained on lockdown , stuck in their homes after a car chase led the @entity9 suspects and a cadre of police into their neighborhood			1
chaos ensued just hours after authorities released images of the suspects			0
it was about 10 p.m. -- close to bedtime for many people , if not past it -- when police received a report that a robbery was under way at a convenience store near the @entity15 campus in @entity4			1
the robbery was the first in a series of crimes that unfolded overnight and well into the next morning , putting the city , suburbs and one of the country 's premier universities on lockdown at various points through the night			0
residents were told to stay inside , away from windows , as city services came to a halt			1
about 20 minutes after the robbery , an @entity15 police officer was fatally shot while responding to a disturbance at @entity94 and @entity95 streets , amid several of the school 's research facilities			1
@entity15 was quick to warn its students of the mayhem on its @entity101 feed and emergency services website			1
" gunshots were reported near @entity104 ( @entity105 ) which is currently surrounded by responding agencies			0
the area is cordoned off			0
please stay clear of area until further notice , " the university posted , asking students to stay away from one of the university 's busiest buildings			0
police arrived on the scene to find the campus police officer in his car with multiple gunshot wounds			1
they took him to @entity121 , but it was too late			0
patrol officer @entity123 , 26 , of @entity124 , who joined the force in january 2012 , was pronounced dead			1
police believe the bombing suspects were responsible for the shooting			1
" @entity123 was one of these guys who really looked at police work as a calling , " mit police chief @entity129 said in a statement			1
" he was born to be a police officer			1
" shortly after the shooting came another report of violence : two men -- whom police now say were brothers living in @entity4 -- hijacked a vehicle at gunpoint in @entity4 , telling the driver that they were the marathon bombers , a law enforcement source told @entity0 's @entity146			1
at some point , at a gas station on @entity150 along the @entity151 , the driver escaped uninjured , @entity4 police reported			1
police , who were tracking the vehicle using its built - in gps system , picked up the chase in @entity54 , a town of 31,000 just west of @entity32			1
the pursuit went into a residential neighborhood , with the suspects throwing explosives at the police , officers said			2
" the suspects and police also exchanged gunfire in the area of @entity169 and @entity170 streets			2
during this pursuit , an ( @entity174 ) police officer was seriously injured and transported to the hospital , " @entity32 police said in a release			1
@entity179 , 33 , was shot and wounded in the incident , a transit police spokesman said			1
@entity0 affiliate @entity181 reported he has been with the department for three years			0
he was taken to @entity183 , @entity181 said			0
the officer 's condition was not immediately known			2
ultimately , one bomber -- later identified as @entity187 , 26 -- got out of the car			0
police shot him , and his brother ran over him as he drove away , according to the law enforcement source			2
he had bullet wounds and an injury from an explosion			0
he was wearing explosives and had an explosive trigger , a source told @entity0			0
he later died , while authorities say his brother , @entity199 , 19 , escaped			0
after a hellish week in @entity32 , residents probably did n't need to be reminded that he was believed armed and dangerous			2
warnings to @entity54 residents followed			1
first , @entity32 police tweeted , " there is an active incident ongoing in @entity54			1
residents in that area are advised to remain in their homes			2
" then , a warning by state police that the search was intensifying : " police will be going door by door , street by street , in and around @entity54			1
police will be clearly identified			2
it is a fluid situation			0
" officers locked down the streets of a @entity54 neighborhood -- the intersection of @entity169 and @entity170 streets lies in a heavily residential area -- after isolating the vehicle			1
@entity228 members arrived on the scene , and police in full body armor carrying assault rifles ran down the streets , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity234			2
@entity237 agents were among those responding , a department spokesman said			0
police requested that residents in the area turn off their mobile phones , saying they believe the devices were used to detonate the @entity9 explosives			1
they went door to door , leaving an already - on - edge suburb even more anxious			0
in @entity4 , police converged on another home , telling residents near @entity19 , " ongoing investigation			1
" @entity250 , who asked local police via @entity101 whether they had any advice for residents who lived on @entity19 , also wrote on @entity101 , " this is scary as f * * *			1
" asked via @entity101 whether he could provide more information , he tweeted , " do n't really have any info			0
@entity257 told us to stay indoors so we just hear lots of sirens outside			0
" as news emerged that the suspects lived with their parents in the @entity19 area , nearby resident @entity265 tweeted , " just so weird to think those guys have been walking around my neighborhood all week			0
" she also declined to speak to @entity0			0
at the corner of @entity19 and @entity4 streets , police tape lined the road , blocking off @entity19 a few houses down from the white clapboard home where the suspects reportedly lived with their parents			1
@entity239 and @entity2 buzzed around the home			0
@entity276 , 50 , has lived in the neighborhood since he was 5			0
he did n't know the suspects , had never seen them			0
the construction worker 's pants were worn and stained with paint			0
the neighborhood , nestled between @entity283 and @entity15 , is a mix of working class and college students , he said , standing in the doorway of a shop			1
" you never know who you 're living next to , " he said			0
" i think it 's nuts			0
what 's this world coming to ? i tell you , the world 's getting screwed up more and more and more			0
" meanwhile , the entire city was shutting down			0

taxi service in @entity32 was suspended			0
@entity15 and @entity283 canceled classes , as did other local colleges @entity307			1
while police requested residents of @entity32 and all its suburbs remain at home , the @entity239 specifically singled out @entity32 , @entity54 , @entity4 , @entity313 - @entity312 , @entity314 and @entity315			1
the governor 's office added @entity318 to the list of places where people should " stay indoors with your doors locked			0
" later , the @entity324 announced that " all vehicle traffic " in @entity54 was suspended and asked that businesses remain closed			1
the transit authority sent buses to evacuate residents , while bomb squads combed the area			1
@entity4 police -- already slammed -- announced on @entity101 that they had fielded more than a dozen calls about suspicious packages in the city			1
all were cleared without incident			0
as dawn came , police announced they were conducting a controlled detonation near @entity340 , across the river from @entity15			1
they also released a vehicle description : " police seeking @entity345 , ' 99 @entity346 , @entity347			2
" the car was later located in @entity4 , but @entity199 was not found			1
another controlled detonation was announced later in the day , as well as another lookout , this one for a green 1999 @entity346 sedan			0
as the situations in @entity4 and @entity54 continued to unfold well into the afternoon , many residents woke to a city in turmoil , though some aspects of life were returning to normal , including taxi service and trash pickup			1
still , residents were nervous			2
tweeted @ @entity362 of @entity54 , " i 'm seriously scared right now			1
way to close to my house			0
( 2blcks ) afraid of explosives			0
be safe people # watertown # bostonstrong " back in @entity4 , authorities erected a blue tent - like tarp outside the suspects ' home			1
much of the home 's contents was placed beneath it , and reporters , who had been kept a block away from the scene , were allowed to have a closer look			0
though across - the - street neighbors @entity14 and @entity380 did n't know the suspects , they had succinct sentiments regarding their fate : they hope the remaining suspect meets the same end as his brother			2
" i hope he 's found dead , " @entity14 said			2
" i do n't think we should pay @entity392 taxpayer dollars to give him a fair trial			0
" @entity380 concurred : " i feel the same			0
for me , it 's better			0
" @entity0 's @entity396 contributed to this report .			0
