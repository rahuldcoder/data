-- it may be far from home but a @entity4 company is powering its way into the @entity7 energy landscape , hoping that its grand plan to introduce a once - shunned technology in the @entity7 will pay off			1
@entity10 , a @entity11 - based energy giant , announced late last year its intention to spend up to $ 14 billion on building the first @entity7 - based commercial plant to perform the alchemy of turning natural gas into liquid fuels -- hailed as one of the biggest investments from a non- @entity7 company in @entity7 history			1
using a process known as gas - to - liquids ( @entity24 ) , the company plans to chemically convert gas into transport fuels , lubricants and other chemical products			1
" in that technology we take natural gas and we actually break the molecule down and then reform that molecule into other high - value products like diesel , " says @entity29 , @entity10 's vice president of @entity7 operations , explaining the company 's proprietary technology			1
gas boom @entity10 's mega-project in @entity42 also includes a separate $ 5 to $ 7 billion ethane cracker and derivatives plant			1
it has picked the @entity7 for its @entity24 facility because the country has abundant shale gas , released through the controversial drilling process of hydraulic fracturing -- or fracking due to the rise in fracking , estimates suggest that the @entity7 has more than 100 years ' supply of natural gas			1
@entity10 , which has been producing synthetic fuels for decades , says it will not be fracking directly to source natural gas feedstock for its facilities , instead tapping into the @entity7 natural gas market through the existing infrastructure			1
read this : @entity64 's biggest dam to light up @entity4 ? " the price of the natural gas in the @entity7 is about the lowest in the world and the markets are also in the @entity7 , " says @entity29			1
" if you look within the @entity7 , particularly on the @entity7 @entity72 where we are ... there is no better infrastructure for the petrochemical industry in the @entity7 , and probably in the world			0
" old technology , new use ? although @entity24 is only now gearing toward its commercial @entity7 debut , the process on which it 's based dates back to the 1920s			2
yet , by the 1950s , the conversion technology was largely abandoned			0
high production costs and the emergence of much cheaper products made from refined crude oil rendered @entity24 commercially unviable			0
meanwhile , the high correlation between natural gas and crude oil markets meant that there was n't a significant difference between the two prices , therefore no opportunity for companies to exploit margins			2
as a result , the technology failed to establish a foothold in the market			0
the only country where it gained wide traction was coal - rich @entity4 where international embargoes during the apartheid years made oil hard to come by			2
today , only @entity10 and @entity108 are converting gas into liquid vehicle fuel on a commercial level			2
yet experts say the current price difference between natural gas and oil , courtesy of the recent shale gas boom , coupled with the long - term global transport trends favoring low - emissions fuels , have helped turn @entity24 into a particularly appealing proposition in places like @entity121 -- as it means less reliance on oil from the @entity123			1
" we 're taking @entity10 's technology , which was developed here in @entity4 for the past 63 years , and helping the @entity7 be more energy independent and have a security of supply , " says @entity10 's chief executive @entity124			1
restraints @entity10 , which already operates smaller @entity24 plants in @entity4 and @entity132 , expects its @entity42 - based facility to produce at least 96,000 barrels per day , creating 1,200 permanent jobs in the following years			1
it describes @entity24 diesel as a cleaner - burning fuel that can be used in existing vehicles and fuel delivery infrastructure without any modifications			0
yet despite the renewed interest in @entity24 , many still see the technology as a precarious business			0
analysts say the requirement to invest hefty sums to build plants and manufacture products means that finances for large - scale projects could often be difficult to balance			0
" the economics can be a bit shaky , " says @entity151 , downstream oil and petrochemicals analyst at @entity153			0
" the whole process is extremely energy intensive and tends to be more costly than crude distillation , " he adds			0
but , more importantly , critics say the biggest danger is that if the cost of gas rises to the price of oil , the technology will lose its commercial appeal			1
" with that amount of capital expenditure , they need to have a degree of certainty that the gas prices are going to stay at a certain price for a long period of time to make it an economically viable project long - term , " says @entity151			2
' very viable ' still , @entity10 is determined to press ahead with its big plans			2
the company says its investments are " well - reviewed " and thoroughly scrutinized " to make sure that these are good sound projects " that will open up new economic opportunities			0
" we 've looked at it in many different ways , " says @entity124			0
" we 've proven it here in @entity4 , we 've proven it up in @entity132 , " he adds			0
" it 's a sought - after product , it 's a sought - after technology -- if you look at those dynamics as macroeconomics over the long term , we see our projects as being very , very viable			0

@entity4 energy giant @entity10 building a gas - to - liquids plant in @entity42
the technology will help it convert natural gas to transportation fuels
project is one of the biggest investments from a non- @entity7 company in @entity7 history
critics warn the technology is not commercially viable if cost of the gas rises to the price of oil
