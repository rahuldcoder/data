@entity0 was just eight years old when she fled @entity1 in 1989 , escaping the horrors of a ruinous civil war that would plague the small @entity5 nation for well over a decade			1
as the daughter of a diplomat , @entity6 went on to live a fairly privileged life abroad , following her family to countries like @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 before moving to the @entity16 to attend college			0
meanwhile , back in @entity1 , the country descended into a conflict that left an estimated 250,000 people dead and many more displaced , as well as destroying much of its economy and infrastructure			2
the fighting came to an end in 2003 and five years later @entity6 decided to pay a visit to @entity1			2
returning home for the first time in nearly 20 years she encountered a wrecked nation that still bore the scars of years of conflict			0
" when i got there i was absolutely shocked and devastated by what i was seeing , " says @entity6			0
" it just was n't the @entity1 which i remembered as a young child -- things like basic necessities were non-existent : access to clean water , access to health care , access to basic education were non-existent and the challenges just seemed so enormous for the government			1
" read this : off - road bikers race to save lives in rural @entity47 witnessing her country 's dire need for redevelopment was a life - changing moment for @entity6			1
she immediately put aside her aspirations to follow in her father 's footsteps pursuing a career as a diplomat			0
instead , she decided that it was time for her to find a way of giving back to her country			0
one year later , @entity6 joined a number of state and private efforts to rebuild @entity1 by setting up @entity47 , a @entity16 - based non-profit organization that 's working to provide access to clean drinking water in @entity1 's rural communities , where running water and sewage infrastructure is often a rare luxury			1
" i decided to focus specifically on water because the issue of water really crosses all aspects of development , " says @entity6 , 30			0
" it affects education , it affects health , it affects gender issues , so for me there was nothing more basic than the issue of water so i decided to make that my cause			0
" @entity85 , which relies on fundraising events and donations for its projects , focuses on implementing low - tech water solutions in the country 's hard - to - reach rural areas , many of which had their major water points and systems destroyed during the war			1
so far the grassroots group has completed about 20 low - cost clean water , sanitation and hygiene projects , including hand dug wells , rehabilitation of existing wells and construction of communal latrines , that have benefited at least 7,000 people			1
@entity6 , who travels to @entity1 every three months to oversee the group 's projects , says that at least half of @entity1 's 4 million population lack access to adequate drinking water			1
the desperate situation is exacting a huge toll on the country 's society : approximately 3,000 people , more than half of which are children under the age of five , die each year from diarrhea due to poor water and sanitation conditions , according to @entity125 figures			1
read this : ' @entity129 diseases ' drive pharma boom in @entity47 as well as saving lives , @entity6 says that access to safe drinking water can also encourage economic growth and improve the educational development of children , especially girls			2
" this is the highlight of my work , " says @entity6 , who was recently named by the @entity137 as one of its @entity139 for 2013			0
" hearing from people who feel gratitude , mothers coming up to me saying that their children no longer suffer from diarrhea ; they spend more time in school ; girls do n't have to walk miles every day to go and fetch water ; men and women can now focus on more productive economic activities like farming and selling in the market			0
" in recent months , @entity47 has embarked on a major initiative that 's aiming to solve the water crisis in @entity157 , one of @entity1 's most underserved areas , where only one fifth of its 80,000 population has access to adequate drinking water			1
called " @entity174 , " the plan is to provide water coverage to 60,000 people in the region by building 250 water points by 2017 and to ensure that the country meets its @entity171 target of 250 people per safe water point			1
" it 's an ambitious goal for such a young organization like ours but we 're absolutely confident that with the right focus and the right funding , if we 're able to raise $ 1.2 million over this time , we can prove that with focus , with strategic implementation , we can solve the water crisis in @entity157			2
" ' read this : solar sisters ' spreading light in @entity47 yet raising funds has always been a big challenge for @entity47 , which faces stiff competition from bigger , more established @entity188 eager to tap into donors ' generosity			0
@entity6 says that limited funds affect the group 's scaling capacity as well as its ability to have more people on the ground			0
@entity47 employs two full - time staff , including @entity6 , and works with up to 30 volunteers annually			2
despite all the challenges , @entity6 says she is determined to continue working to improve living conditions in her country			0
she says her long - term goal is to bring access to safe drinking water , sanitation and hygiene to as many regions of @entity1 as possible , as well as other post-conflict countries that face similar problems			1
" if i can be known as the woman that helped solve the water crisis in @entity1 and beyond , " she says , " if i can be a part of that solution , then for me i would have achieved success			2
