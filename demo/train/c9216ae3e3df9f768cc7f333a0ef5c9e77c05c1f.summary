-- the movie " @entity1 " is celebrating its 25th anniversary , but the 1988 blockbuster almost did n't become the movie beloved by audiences today			1
for starters , @entity6 originally turned down the lead , writers were seriously considering the title " @entity11 , " and producers had trouble attaching a director to the picture			1
" @entity6 was my first choice but he said ' no , ' " director @entity18 told @entity0 , " and so did everyone else because there were other movies with the same premise			1
so i decided to go with someone who 's a behavioral actor -- @entity24			1
" the tale of a boy whose diminutive stature prevents him from enjoying what he perceives to be the spoils of maturity makes a wish to be " big " at a carnival , only to wake up the next day as a 30 - year - old man			2
it 's hard to imagine @entity24 in the man - child role of @entity37 , but @entity24 was , in fact , attached to the role prior to backing out in negotiations			1
@entity24 's interest in the film validated the project for @entity44			1
it was only her second directorial effort , and she soon found a-listers vying for the part of @entity37			2
@entity44 knew @entity6 from their days as sitcom stars on the @entity52 lot			1
the former " @entity54 " actress thought the former " @entity58 " star 's " sweet , innocent face " would be a good fit			2
but there was big trouble for @entity44 , whose career as a director was at stake			2
not only were three other body - switching movies currently in production ( " @entity67 , " " @entity68 , " and " @entity69 " ) , but " @entity1 " was the last one out of the gate that year because the crew had to wait for @entity6 to become available			1
despite those odds , " @entity1 " garnered @entity6 his first @entity74 nomination and the movie earned an @entity77 nomination for @entity78			1
it was one of 1988 's top - grossing hits , and the first movie directed by a woman to break the $ 100 million box office mark			1
actor @entity84 , who played young @entity37 , told @entity0 that he originally auditioned for the role of @entity37 's best friend , @entity86			1
it was the child actor 's second audition ever			2
months later , when @entity6 came aboard , @entity89 got a callback			1
@entity89 's hair was dyed slightly darker and he wore green contacts in order to better resemble @entity6			1
" in the first week of shooting i lost a tooth , " said @entity89			2
" i was very late in losing my teeth , and i remember production lost their minds			2
they built what they call a ' flipper ' -- a band attached to the tooth that i had to wear in my mouth during scenes ; but i could pop it in and out of my mouth if i wanted to			0
" @entity44 recalled demanding that @entity89 , a fellow @entity110 , @entity112 native , " stop flipping " multiple times on - set			0
@entity89 and @entity6 , of course , could not be in any of the same scenes , but @entity6 ' nice guy reputation was already filmdom lore			1
" the producers were nervous for him [ @entity6 ] because he refused to take a limo to the set and said he would just take the subway , " said @entity89			1
" he showed up with a backpack and a hat on and he was just really down to earth			0
" for the sake of authenticity , @entity44 built the @entity37 character around the real - life @entity89			0
@entity37 's bedroom resembled @entity89 's			0
" the @entity131 poster on the wall , the @entity134 game , that was me , " he said			0
@entity44 recorded home movies of @entity89 and his friends interacting so @entity6 could study their movements : how kids acted , ran , talked , and joked around with one another			1
the role required that @entity6 un-learn the societal disciplines of being an adult			1
@entity89 even read many of @entity6 ' lines as a guideline to ensure a truly childlike delivery of lines that was n't over-the - top			1
@entity89 was n't the only child to contribute to the production end of things			0
the song @entity37 sang to prove his identity to @entity86 ( " @entity155 , shimmy , cocoa pop. @entity155 , shimmy , rock ... " ) was taught to @entity6 by his then 10 - year - old son , @entity160 , who learned the little ditty at summer camp			1
@entity6 still knows it by heart ( and soul )			1
the @entity167 sequence arguably stands out as the film 's most iconic			0
the piano scene was key for many reasons , but primarily it was instrumental in getting @entity37 and his boss to bond			0
because @entity176 , pizza and loft apartments do n't pay for themselves			0
@entity44 recalled preparing for the piano scene months in advance			0
the director approached the inventor of what is now the tourist attraction known as the @entity183 and asked for a practical instrument that the actors could play " @entity186 " and " chopsticks " on			0
cardboard mockups of the piano were created for @entity6 and actor @entity190 to practice on at home			1
dance doubles were hired for close - up insert shots of the actors ' feet , but in the end the footage was never used -- @entity6 and @entity190 were just that good			1
as a nod to the scene , when the front cover of @entity202 's new 25th anniversary edition @entity200 is opened , " @entity186 " plays via an internal sound chip			0
@entity89 believes " @entity1 " still resonates with audiences because " anybody can watch it			1
there 's no violence in it			0
there 's no gratuitous sex in it			0
it 's something that 's safe			0
but there are also these moments of pure magic			0
" fans of " @entity1 " have their own personal magic moments from the film , whether they 're reminiscing about the excitement of one 's first paycheck ( $ 187 ! ) ; or watching @entity6 in a white - sequined tuxedo lick cream cheese out of a celery stick , put it back , eat baby corn as if its on - the - cob and then proceed to dry heave after sampling @entity229 caviar ; or remembering the days of being uninhibited enough to jump on a trampoline in a skirt			1
for others , perhaps it 's the simple sweetness of @entity37 giving his colleague and soon - to - be girlfriend , @entity237 ( played by @entity238 ) " a glow - in - the - dark compass ring			0
so you do n't get lost			0
" the writers agonized over whether it was even appropriate for the @entity37 character to enter into a sexual relationship with a grown woman			0
they eventually defaulted to @entity246 law and made him 13 -- he was originally supposed to be 12 -- meaning he 'd already been bar - mitzvahed and thus undergone the rite of passage into manhood			2
of course ( spoiler alert ! ) @entity37 misses his family , tracks down the @entity254 machine , and everyone ( except maybe @entity237 ) lives happily ever after			0
@entity89 said the scene in which he walks away from @entity238 , swimming in the @entity6 - sized suit was particularly memorable			1
he kept looking at the wrong place as he said his lines			0
" sometimes the camera is the actor and you have to act to it even if the actor is standing four feet away , " he said			2
" in the scene where i was wearing the big suit , gazing at @entity238 , i was looking at the real @entity238 instead of at the camera and @entity18 would be like , ' cut ! ' " @entity44 hopes audiences continue to come away from the film with the notion that while everybody has to grow up , it 's important not to lose the child inside			0
that life will never be that simple again , and it 's important to retain that innocence			0
" everyone says , ' when i 'm big i 'm gon na ... ' , " @entity44 told @entity0			0
" that 's the message i held onto during ' @entity1			2
' " @entity6 spoke about the wonder of childhood in an interview on the @entity200 extras			2
" we go through periods of our lives where we 're able to fall asleep in the back of the car while @entity287 drives home , " said @entity6 , " and later on we find ourselves being @entity287 who has to stay awake and drive while everybody 's asleep in the back of the car			2
when you grow up it 's all over with			0
