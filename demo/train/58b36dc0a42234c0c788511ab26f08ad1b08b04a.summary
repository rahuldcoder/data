-- as the summer ocean waves wash up onto @entity4 's beaches , we find ourselves thinking , nervously , about @entity6 's " @entity5 " and the paralyzing fear that sharks inspire in us			1
yet , paradoxically , we celebrate global attempts to protect the declining number of sharks			0
the world has figured out we need these species , along with all creatures of the @entity15 , to maintain a delicately balanced ecosystem			0
sharks , in particular , are " in " these days			0
thanks to good public policy and the power of public education and multimedia campaigns featuring stars such as @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 , killing sharks for shark fin soup is no longer cool			1
the demand has been rising for decades , threatening sharks with extinction -- up to 100 million sharks are killed each year just for their fins			1
but we have started to reverse the trend , particularly in affluent areas of the @entity4 and overseas where restaurants once proudly displayed shark fin delicacies on the menu			1
in @entity42 , and other states , a ban on the sale and possession of shark fin soup has gone into effect this year after aggressive marketing campaigns by @entity46 and other organizations			1
overseas , marketing and public diplomacy efforts featuring posters on public transportation systems and tv ads have been underway for the past few years			0
these efforts all show signs of success , on both the supply side and the demand side of trade in shark fins			1
@entity61 's @entity60 tracked 3,100 metric tons of shark fin being imported from the island to @entity64 last year , but this year 's numbers are way down			1
stopping the killing of sharks is part of a broader movement to stop the killing of wild animals and the trafficking of wildlife products around the world -- products that come from poaching elephants , tigers and rhinos , in addition to killing marine life			1
opinion : elephant slaughter surges as ivory funds terror in november , former @entity4 secretary of state @entity84 called for a global strategy to protect wildlife , raising the level of urgency to a growing national security threat			2
for example , the poaching of elephants in search of ivory tusks for luxury goods had became a full - scale war between poachers , who are sometimes terrorists , and governments in parts of @entity100			0
illegal shipments of tusks across porous borders bring in the prizes of money and weapons			0
once a marginalized issue of @entity4 foreign policy , @entity107 and current secretary of state @entity108 have placed wildlife trafficking at the top of the agenda , given its wide tentacles to @entity100 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 and consumers in almost every country			2
according to @entity121 , which has been tracking elephant poaching , the financial losses place the issue on the scale of global drugs and crime , with an estimated 30,000 @entity100 elephants being killed for their tusks last year -- a rate of slaughter , say wildlife experts , that could drive the animals to extinction within the century			2
the dwindling of african elephant populations is alarming			0
much of the ivory is destined for @entity64 to make chopsticks and jewelry , and the @entity139 , where it can fetch upward of $ 1,300 a pound			2
whether it is shark fin soup or ivory piano keys , killing animals is big business			1
together with international partners , conservation groups , nonprofits and businesses , the @entity4 is leading the worldwide effort to reduce demand for high - end jewelry , herbal medicines , skins , foods and other products that rely on killing animals and marine life			1
working with governments through existing protocols and conventions , the @entity4 is convening stakeholders to pressure those who provide sanctuary for the poachers or allow parts and goods to make their way out of countries to market			2
public diplomacy and public education , together with sound policy , give us a model for success			0
using @entity177 , @entity178 , public service advertisements , the media , celebrity interviews , videos and classroom teaching , we can martial the forces to convince consumers that buying products that come from slaughtered elephants or harpooned sharks is simply wrong and dangerous			2
and we can track the results of wildlife trafficking and punish the offenders			0
this is one of those rare international tales of where the public and private sector , along with @entity194 , can create a very different kind of movie			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity202 .			0

@entity202 : as @entity64 gets richer , demand for shark skin soup rising
international campaigns and help from @entity4 have *slowed* the demand for the soup , she says
she says *saving* sharks is part of a movement *helping* elephants , rhinos , other animals
