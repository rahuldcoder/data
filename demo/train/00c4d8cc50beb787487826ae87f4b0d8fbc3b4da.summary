[ previous story , published at 10:51 p.m. et ] ( @entity1 ) -- police in the @entity4 capital of @entity0 were stopping cars and cordoning off sections of the city sunday morning after two shootings within hours of each other left two people dead and five wounded			1
it was unclear whether the shootings were connected , police said			2
no one has been arrested and police are working as if there might be more than one gunman			1
officers were searching taxis and private cars , having the drivers open their vehicle trunks as the city was on high alert , @entity33 , a reporter for @entity8 in @entity4 , reported			1
a police spokesman said there is no ban on civilians moving around , but they should respect police roadblocks			2
the second incident took place about 10 hours after a deadly terror attack			0
in the latest incident , shots were fired near a synagogue when a person approached two police officers and began shooting			1
another person was shot and later died , and the police officers were wounded -- one in an arm , the other in a leg , police said			2
their injuries were n't life - threatening			0
police earlier said the gunman ran from the scene			1
the shooter was a man dressed in a light gray jacket , black pants and black shoes			0
the jacket was different from the one believed to have worn by a possible suspect in the first shooting			2
earlier , a gunman stormed a cafe where controversial cartoonist @entity77 and his supporters had gathered for a free speech forum , killing a man and wounding three police officers before fleeing , police said			1
@entity82 -- founder of the @entity83 , created two years ago in support of the @entity86 cartoonist whose portrayals of the @entity88 angered many in the @entity91 world -- told @entity1 that security personnel on site moved her and others to safe areas after shots rang out			1
she and @entity77 ended up in a storage room together , holding hands , until police told them it was ok to come out			2
" we have never taken any chances , " @entity82 said , referring to the heavy security from police , @entity4 intelligence services and @entity77 ' own security guards at this and other committee events			1
" what we have so much been frightened would happen happened			0
" why @entity91 forbids images of @entity88 after the attack , what appeared to be the man , dressed in dark clothes , carjacked a civilian 's dark @entity116 and drove away , @entity4 police said			1
that vehicle was found between two train stations			0
the gunman remained at large saturday night			2
police initially had said there were two shooters in the first incident			2
the discrepancy was caused by chaos in the aftermath of the incident , @entity0 police spokesman @entity125 said			1
the 55 - year - old man who was killed has n't been identified			0
nor have authorities identified the three wounded law enforcement officers -- two with @entity4 intelligence and one police officer -- though investigator @entity136 did say none of them suffered serious injuries			1
given @entity141 extremists ' documented threats against @entity142 and their willingness to act on similar threats -- as proven last month in @entity145 -- @entity4 prime minister @entity146 said , " everything points to ... the shooting in @entity149 ( being ) a political assassination and therefore a terror attack			1
" @entity146 vowed that " all resources will be used to find ( those responsible ) and bring them before a judge " for an attack she said filled her " with deep anger			0
" " we have some difficult days ahead , " the prime minister said			0
" ... but in @entity4 , we will never bow to violence			2
" about 30 people -- including @entity77 and @entity145 ambassador to @entity4 @entity162 , who tweeted later that he is " still alive in the room " -- went through airport - level security to get into saturday 's event at the building located in what @entity82 described as a " very peaceful area " of the @entity4 capital			1
but it did n't last long , with noise erupting just a few minutes in			0
@entity172 , a satire researcher and @entity4 university professor , said he heard about 30 shots at about 3:30 p.m. ( 9:30 a.m. et ) , as well as someone yelling in a foreign language			2
" everybody , of course , panicked in the room and tried to run , " @entity172 told @entity1			0
" ... we were just hiding ... and hoping for the best			0
" the attacker made it just inside the building but apparently got no farther , said @entity82 , a journalist and literary critic			0
she recalled how one man there " acted very quickly and courageously " by pushing a woman down to the ground , then putting himself on top of her so she would n't get shot			0
bodyguards returned fire , the @entity0 police official said			1
at one point , two people came running into the meeting room -- one of them bleeding from the leg , after having apparently been shot -- to " tell us to calm down , " @entity172 said			0
sirens could be heard 10 to 15 minutes after the shots , at which point @entity172 said " we started to feel more safe			0
" the discussion on free speech even resumed , though eventually all those at the event were bused to a local police station			2
@entity0 police later tweeted a picture of the suspect , covered up and dressed in dark clothes , wanted in connection with the attack			1
" we are investigating this as a terror attack , " said @entity136 , the police official , noting that authorities are taking into account that both the @entity145 ambassador and @entity77 attended saturday 's event			1
" there is an extremely large presence of police in @entity0 right now			1
" @entity4 in @entity0 and beyond quickly got support from around the world , including from the mayor of @entity225 -- who just more than a month ago lived this same nightmare during the massacre at the offices of satirical magazine @entity230 in her city			1
" in the name of @entity235 , " mayor @entity233 tweeted , " i express my full support			0
" like @entity230 editor @entity237 , @entity77 was one of nine faces on a " @entity243 " graphic published by @entity241 's @entity240 for " crimes against @entity91			1
" others include a pair of @entity4 journalists who published 12 cartoons depicting @entity88 in the @entity251 - @entity250 newspaper ; @entity254 pastor @entity253 , who burned a quran ; and " @entity256 " author @entity252			2
because of that , @entity82 said , " there 's no doubt " the @entity0 event was targeted because of @entity77 , who has " not been able to live a normal life " for years , according to the committee			1
" this is ... why we set up the committee : to support mr. @entity77 and support his right to freedom of speech , " @entity82 said			0
@entity142 became a target after his 2007 cartoon depicting @entity88 with the body of a dog -- an animal that conservative @entity273 consider unclean			0
in a @entity1 interview later that year from his home in rural @entity86 , @entity77 said the drawing was calculated to elicit a reaction			0
" it should be possible to insult all religions in a democratic way , " he said then			0
" if you insult one ( religion ) , then you should insult the other ones			0
" @entity1 's @entity284 reported from @entity0			1
