-- @entity2 president @entity1 has launched an end of season salvo at @entity6 supremo @entity5 , saying " the era of the one man show can not continue " if the sport is to move forward			1
" we are approaching the time when we need to think about the future , " said @entity10 , who was unhappy about the role @entity5 played in the controversy surrounding the last race in @entity14 where @entity15 clinched the title from @entity17			1
@entity2 believed @entity15 may have made an illegal overtaking move under a yellow flag which , should he have been punished , would have meant @entity17 took the title instead			1
" every so often , @entity5 likes to play the boss and gets involved in matters that do n't concern him : godfathers no longer exist , at least not in @entity6 , " @entity10 was quoted on the official @entity2 website			1
" interpretation of flags , be they yellow or blue is nothing to do with him and he used expressions that i do not accept			0
" our behavior in this instance was not only transparent , but perfect and maybe he would do better to think about attracting bigger crowds and more youngsters , and to discuss more with the television stations and the media			0
" @entity10 conceded that @entity5 had achieved " significant things " but that at 82 years of age questions should be asked about his continued stewardship of the sport			2
" it 's not a case of replacing @entity5 and in fact i do not like doing to others what i would not want to happen to myself			2
" the future should be in the hands of a team that will look after all the different areas			0
" we are slowly approaching the end of a period characterized by the style of one man who has done significant things			0
" @entity5 recently said he would only quit when he felt he was not doing a good job			2
" i hope that 's what i can do ; when i feel i ca n't deliver , i will certainly say goodbye , " he was quoted on the official @entity6 website			2
@entity10 again reiterated his opposition to the ban on testing during the @entity6 grand prix season and said he would be putting across his arguments when he meets @entity5 and @entity71 president @entity70			1
" as for testing , it 's getting close to ridiculous , " he said			0
" the @entity71 is not opposed to it , we are not and so what is the reason for it , " he added			0
he also congratulated @entity77 and @entity15 on their double victory in the drivers ' and constructors ' championship			0
@entity15 , who clinched a title hat - trick in @entity14 , " had an amazing car and is a great driver , " said @entity10			1
" if for whatever reason , @entity17 was to retire , then i 'd like @entity15 , a driver who has his feet on the ground and a great will to win			0
" @entity2 has been strongly linked with a move for @entity90 's @entity15 , but will field @entity17 and @entity14 @entity91 for the 2013 season .			1
