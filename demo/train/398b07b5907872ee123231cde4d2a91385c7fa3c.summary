from prison , where she has been locked up for a murder she says she did n't commit			0
jailbreaking is not @entity2 's forte -- he 's a community - college professor in @entity13 and he drives a prius			1
but all judicial appeals have failed , and the couple 's young son is so very sad			1
so , spurred by love , despair , and belief in his wife 's innocence , @entity2 turns to desperate measures			2
first , however , he does some @entity25 homework that leads him to @entity26 ( @entity27 , ) an ex-con - turned - author who provides expert advice on the art of escape			0
@entity26 's how - to - break - the - law lesson -- as ludicrous as anything else in this enjoyably zigzaggy exercise in accumulating peril -- grants @entity27 the fun of experimenting with an @entity40 ex-con accent for his one scene			2
it also sets up the movie 's real strength , which is generating escalating waves of plot tension and misdirection as @entity2 , heeding advice , makes his jail - busting moves			1
writer - director @entity50 ( " crash , " ) who adapted " the @entity9 " from a 2008 @entity52 thriller , " @entity53 , " clearly has @entity56 's wrong - man - in - wrong - place psychological archetype in mind as @entity2 weaves all over @entity13			2
@entity5 , for her part , has no idea of her husband 's plan -- the usually sunnier @entity63 is an interesting , counterintuitive casting choice -- and when she finds out , she adds her own complications			1
soon the chase becomes its own perpetual - motion machine , one that ticks down to the last second			0
with cops closing in , there 's passport forgery , robbery , lock picking , shooting , and driving too fast while behind the wheel of a @entity14			1
there 's also a bit of tampering with medical records , the inevitable follow - up to @entity5 's demonstration in @entity78 , scene 1 that she 's diabetic			0
throughout , @entity3 marshals his unique physical gravitas -- his way of speaking with his eyes while remaining very still and quiet -- to bolster @entity50 ' more sentimental premise that the character represents any average @entity2 who loves his family deeply enough to declare , screw the system ! we 're outta here ! while @entity3 throws his serious weight behind the notion of a man angry , weary , and bereft enough of his ordinary life to take drastic steps , the movie throws obstacle after obstacle his way and says to the audience : oh , he squeaked through that ? how about this ? b + see more about " the @entity9 " at @entity0			0
