former rap mogul @entity0 is facing a possible murder charge after allegedly running over two men , killing one , following an argument in @entity6 , @entity7 , according to authorities			1
" so far , people we talked to said it looked like it was an intentional act			0
so we 're handling it as a homicide , " @entity15 police lt. @entity13 said before the arrest			1
@entity0 , 49 , turned himself in to @entity20 investigators early friday			1
he 's being held in lieu of about a $ 2 million bond pending a court appearance , which is n't expected until at least monday , according to @entity24 , a spokeswoman for the @entity27 district attorney 's office			1
@entity1 affiliate @entity28 and the @entity29 quoted @entity0 's attorney , @entity30 , as saying @entity0 feared for his life and was trying to flee when the incident happened			1
" we feel strongly mr. @entity0 did not do anything wrong in this matter			1
he was attacked by a number of individuals , that has already been corroborated by certain witnesses			0
he left the scene because he was in fear for his safety and life , " he said			0
in a conversation with @entity1 before the arrest , @entity30 declined to confirm to @entity1 whether @entity0 was driving			1
@entity30 has n't returned multiple calls from @entity1 seeking comment since the arrest			2
the thursday incident allegedly began with an argument on the set of the biopic " @entity51 , " a film about the highly influential and controversial rap group @entity54 it then spilled over to the parking lot of @entity56 , where authorities say @entity0 tracked the men			1
" it looks like he drove backward and struck the victims			0
and then went forward and struck them again as he left , " @entity62 said			0
officers later found @entity0 's @entity66 abandoned in @entity67			1
@entity0 turned himself in early friday at the @entity68 , accompanied by his attorney			1
after being questioned by detectives , @entity0 was booked and later transferred to the @entity71 in downtown @entity15 , according to jail records			2
the man who died has been identified as @entity74 , 55			0
the second man 's name is @entity77 , 51			0
@entity0 founded the wildly successful @entity78 in 1991			2
he signed artists such as @entity80 ( since then known as @entity80 and @entity80 ) and @entity81 , raising the profile of @entity84 rap in the process			0
along with rapper , producer and future entrepreneur @entity88 , he rode the wave of the fame from albums such as dr. @entity88 's " @entity92 " in 1992			0
in 1993 , @entity80 's debut album , " @entity94 , " broke new ground in a genre of music previously dominated by @entity99 artists			0
@entity0 's signing of controversial rapper @entity81 in the mid- ' 90s further increased the profiles of both @entity0 and his company in the hip - hop game			1
but with his imposing physique and reputation for not being averse to violence , @entity0 also found himself at the center of a feud between @entity99 and @entity84 rappers			2
the feud started as a war of words between rappers from each coast , but things quickly escalated in 1994 after @entity81 accused producer @entity116 and rapper @entity117 of involvement in a 1994 shooting at a @entity121 studio that left @entity81 injured			0
both @entity116 -- who over the years has also been known as " @entity116 , " " @entity116 and " @entity116 " -- and @entity117 denied the accusations			0
the tensions intensified in 1995 after @entity0 gave a speech at the @entity125 , where he said , " any artist out there that want to be an artist and stay a star , and do n't have to worry about the executive producer trying to be all in the videos , all on the record , dancing ... come to @entity78 ! " many took the statement as a direct dig at @entity136 , who often appeared in his artists ' music videos			1
some have pointed to the feud as a contributing factor in the shooting deaths of both @entity81 in 1996 and @entity117 in 1997			0
@entity0 was driving the car in which @entity81 was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in @entity147 in 1996			2
shortly afterward , @entity0 spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions			2
that prison time -- along with @entity81 's death , feuds between @entity0 and a number of rappers and desertions by @entity88 , @entity80 and others -- contributed to the label 's bankruptcy in 2006			1
in august , @entity0 and two others were shot while inside a celebrity - filled @entity163 party hosted by singer @entity164 on the eve of the @entity166			2
in october , he was busted along with comedian @entity167 for allegedly stealing a photographer 's camera			0
who is @entity0 ? stories behind tough hip - hop legend @entity1 's @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176 contributed to this report .			1

@entity0 wo n't appear in court until at least monday , *prosecutor* 's office says
