few feats of engineering are synonymous with an entire industry			2
but @entity4 's 747 jumbo jet revolutionized air travel , adding to the glamour , romance and , most significantly , affordability of commercial flight , while simultaneously slapping it in the face by ushering in the bovine era of mass tourism			1
@entity14 in size , the shape of the 747 is iconic itself -- the enormous wings , four engines and that front end " hump " make it one of the world 's most recognizable aircraft			1
to this day , the " upstairs " seating area -- reserved for a lucky few each flight -- imparts a sense of prestige and exclusivity			2
@entity4 has delivered more than 1,400 of the aircraft to airlines around the world -- not bad for a plane now into its fifth decade			1
since its historic debut at the @entity36 in 1969 , the company has introduced a number of variations to the 747 family , including the 747 - 100 , 747 - 200 and 747 - 300			1
the most common variety for international travelers today are versions of the 747 - 400			1
each new version has brought enhancements			1
the 747 - 400 's most noticeable change was the addition of winglets , which @entity4 describes as " wing tip extensions which reduce lift - induced drag and provide some extra lift			1
" the 747 - 400 is no longer being built -- production ended in 2009			1
its successor , the 747 - 8 @entity54 , rolled out last year and is currently being built at a rate of two per month			1
each 747 - 8 is made up of about 6 million parts and has a list price of $ 351.4 million			1
@entity58 is the only airline flying the passenger version of the 747 - 8			1
it has six in the skies serving cities such as @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66			0
the first was delivered in 2012 , one of 19 of the aircraft the @entity70 carrier ordered , with deliveries expected to be completed in 2015			2
this month , the airline added the 747 - 8 to its @entity74 - @entity62 route and invited @entity75 to tour the latest version of the classic jumbo jet			1
so what 's different ? no surprise that the 747 - 8 @entity54 looks like a 747			1
though 70 % of the airplane 's structural weight is brand new , it has the same iconic shape , though with some noticeable external differences			2
the wings are new -- an upgrade @entity4 had n't originally intended for the new design			0
gone are the winglets , replaced by raked wingtips @entity4 says increase aerodynamics and , thus , fuel efficiency			0
the same design is being used on @entity4 's @entity92			0
@entity4 says the 747 - 8 is approximately 14 % more fuel efficient per seat than its predecessor			1
the engines are new , too			0
there are still four , but the new design features a scallop - edged casing around each newly developed @entity99 engine			2
as important , though less noticeable to the typical passenger , the plane has been stretched			0
it 's 5.6 meters ( 18 feet ) longer than its predecessor , with a total length of 76.3 meters ( 250 feet )			0
@entity4 points out this makes the 747 - 8 about a meter longer than the @entity105 and thereby the longest commercial aircraft in the world			1
the upper deck is also stretched			0
" we chose this location ( for additional room ) because it is here that the airlines benefit the most -- both from the premium seating on both the upper and lower decks , as well as in the cargo hold , " says @entity4 's @entity109			0
inside , the plane still has that exhilarating new airplane smell ( kind of like new car smell , but a lot more expensive ) , with windows and surfaces joyously free of the scratches , smudges and hair goo residue all too typical of the commercial flying experience			2
when we toured it was also free of other passengers -- no screaming kids nor ( sadly ) smiling cabin crew manning the drinks cart			0
while we ca n't comment on the flying experience , the @entity58 747 - 8 interior is sleek , comfortable , modern and efficient			1
in other words , @entity135 -- designed to get you from a to b in good shape without over the top frills			0
in economy class , where seats are naturally skeletal compared with their fat cousins up front , nothing feels tacky or about to break			0
or worse still , like your father - in - law has been sitting in it for 20 years			2
' wow factor ' with the plane comes @entity58 's new business class , which will be retrofitted on the rest of the airline 's fleet			1
we 've reeled off some of business class ' features and other enhancements in the gallery above			0
expect the mod cons -- fully flat seats in biz and first , video on demand , power plugs and @entity161 ports and new features such as sound - insulating curtains and cool automatic window shades in first class			2
on the whole , the plane feels spacious			0
admittedly , this is easier to pull off when no one else is aboard , but relocating some storage area to sidewalls ( not in overhead spaces ) adds a lot of cabin room and makes it less likely passengers will bash their heads on compartments above in that frantic post-landing - must - touch - my - carryon - immediately moment of choreographed ( and mystifying ) panic			1
@entity58 can carry 386 passengers on its 747 - 8 in its 8 - 80 - 298 ( first - business - economy ) arrangement			1
the upper deck is home to 32 business class seats in a 2 - 2 configuration -- the width of the area is roughly the same as the interior of the 737 - 700			2
it 's here and at the front of the plane that @entity58 is aiming to attract customers in the competitive but lucrative @entity205 - @entity70 route			1
" this gives us a competitive shift			0
we have been here for 52 years and we know that customer expectations are high			0
that 's why we are the first to bring the 747 - 8 to @entity74 , " says @entity211 , @entity58 general manager for @entity74 , @entity212 , @entity213 and @entity214			1
" it brings a unique element to our brand			0
from an economic point of view , it gives us more capacity and is more cost effective			0
for customers , they will notice and appreciate the enhancements on board			0
" more than anything , it is exciting			0
it is a new experience			0
it is a new aircraft			2
there is certainly a ' wow ' factor , not just for our customers			0
people all over the airport are taking pictures of the aircraft every day			2
" still capturing attention , this legend of the skies is showing no signs of retirement			0
rather , the 747 - 8 is the latest chapter in a legendary chunk of aviation history .			1

747 - 8 @entity54 is latest version of the iconic 747 jumbo jet
