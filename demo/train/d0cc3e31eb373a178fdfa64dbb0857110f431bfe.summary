the @entity1 will keep a larger force in @entity3 for the first few months of 2015 than it initially planned to , outgoing @entity1 defense secretary @entity0 said on saturday			1
during a joint press conference with @entity3 president @entity7 , @entity5 said that up to 10,800 troops will remain in the country at the start of next year ; a previous announcement called for 1,000 fewer troops			1
@entity5 arrived in @entity3 on saturday in order to assess the nation as the @entity1 begins the drawdown of its forces in the @entity18 , he said			1

@entity32 has seen an uptick in @entity35 attacks in recent weeks , a sign of instability that he said comes as no surprise			0
" it 's predictable that they would do everything they could and continue to do to try to disrupt and discourage the new government of president @entity7 , " he said			0
however , the spike in violence in the @entity3 capital was not a factor in the decision to keep more @entity1 troops in the country next year , a @entity48 official said			1
the decision is due to the late signing of the @entity58 , which allows a specified amount of @entity1 troops to remain in @entity3 after the combat mission ends this year			1
@entity7 's predecessor , @entity61 , would not sign a security agreement with the @entity1			0
despite the attacks , the @entity48 said @entity3 forces are performing " well , " and are now in the lead on 99 % of the missions			0
" the gaps are in aviation and @entity72 ( intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance ) , " a senior defense official told reporters on the flight to @entity3			0
this is his fourth and last visit to @entity3 as defense secretary			1
his first trip to @entity3 was 12 years ago as part of a @entity81 delegation			0
asked by @entity82 how he would define victory more than a decade later @entity5 said the people of @entity3 are far better off today than they were 13 years ago , citing an elected government and a national security force			2
" they 're not completely there yet , but they 've come a long way , " @entity5 said			0
" that 's to the credit certainly of the @entity1 , the sacrifice , the blood and the treasure that we 've made there			0
" his visit comes after the establishment of a new unity government in the fall , which @entity5 will express strong support for during his trip , a second senior defense official said			1
the drawdown of @entity1 forces in @entity3 will be " gradual " compared with the withdrawal of troops from @entity111 , the first official said			1
in 2016 , the number of troops will slide down to 5,500 and by 2017 the coalition will consolidate to @entity32			0
" as we draw down the combat mission , we have not forgotten what brought @entity1 to @entity3 over a decade ago , " @entity5 said on saturday			1
@entity118 formally ends combat mission in @entity3 maintaining a troop presence will allow the @entity1 to monitor the progress of the @entity3 security forces over time , according to the first official			2
" the @entity3 people and the @entity3 government ... have asked us to stay , " @entity5 said contrasting the drawdown to the withdrawal troops in @entity111 , where the @entity1 could not negotiate an agreement that would allow a residual force in the country			1
the trip to @entity32 follows @entity32 's announcement last month that he will step down as soon as the @entity134 confirms his successor			2
