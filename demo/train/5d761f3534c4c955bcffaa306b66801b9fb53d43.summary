@entity0 told reporters sunday that the purpose of her return to @entity4 for the first time in over six years was " to support candidates			1
" but 2016 's presidential politics were everywhere on a sun - soaked field in @entity10 , @entity4			1
@entity11 captured the sentiment best herself with a joke from the stage of the 37th and final @entity16 : " @entity17			2
i 'm back ! " @entity11 left @entity4 in 2008 after finishing a disappointing third place in the @entity17 caucus			1
six years have changed things , though , and @entity11 has been followed by the possibility of running for president since she stepped down as secretary of state in 2013			0
polls show her as the prohibitive favorite for the nomination , and her visit to @entity4 this weekend has raised the specter even higher that she will likely run for president			1
from the stage on sunday , @entity11 admitted the 2016 question is on her mind			1
" it is true , i am thinking about it , " @entity11 said to a roaring applause			1
" but for today , that is not why i am here			0
i am here first and foremost for @entity38 [ @entity16 ] , for @entity39 [ his wife ] and for the great candidates that you have a chance to elect			2
" the crowd reacted with unhappy groans , some yelled " just do it ! " organizers and @entity11 supporters went to lengths to stress that the former first family was simply coming to @entity4 to honor sen. @entity16 -- who is retiring at the end of the year -- and help raise money for @entity55 in the state			1
signs reading " @entity57 " encircled the idyllic field where the steak fry was held and candidates running for office spoke before @entity11			2
@entity11 talks up fellow democrats @entity11 herself was also clear to endorse and talk - up @entity55 running in @entity4 , including @entity66 hopeful @entity65			1
the former first family headlined a fundraiser before the steak fry with the candidates , where they spoke to donors about the importance of electing @entity55			1
" i hope this whole event helps @entity65 , because he should be the next senator , " @entity11 told reporters at the steak fry			0
" he 's got the record , he 's got the commitment			2
he 's got the right values			2
he should be the next senator			0
" but 2016 -- and the possibility of @entity11 running -- touched every part of the steak fry			2
it was a large reason 6,200 people attended and 200 journalists covered the event , according to organizers			0
it was also the reason a number of former @entity11 aides traveled to @entity4 , filtering through the crowd , chatting with @entity17 activists			1
part fundraiser , part pep rally , part barbecue , the event has become a must - stop for @entity55 thinking about running for president and is widely seen as the biggest annual event in @entity4 politics			1
despite the name , steaks are grilled , not fried , and it is customary for headliners to flip steaks for themselves			0
@entity11 stuck with tradition on sunday , flipping a steak with her husband , former president @entity11 , who chose to flip veggie burgers			0
other than that , much of the event broke with the traditions @entity11 has been following since leaving the @entity113			0
' in just 50 days , @entity114 have a choice to make ' @entity0 's speech was markedly different than the ones she generally gives on the paid speaking circuit			1
gone were many of the stories of her personal history , instead @entity11 focused on the differences between @entity55 and @entity122 and spoke at length about women 's rights			1
" now , think about it , in just 50 days , @entity114 have a choice to make , " she said			0
" a choice between the guardians of gridlock and the champions of shared opportunity and shared prosperity			0
a chance to elect leaders who will carry on @entity16 's legacy of fighting for hard working families			2
" in her last year on the paid speaking circuit , @entity11 and her aides have kept the media largely at arms length , rarely answering questions from the gaggle of journalists following her			0
on sunday , she shirked that tradition			0
after flipping steaks , she ventured over the a swarm of media cameras and reporters			0
" it is fabulous to be back			2
i love @entity17 , " @entity0 said to questions about 2016			1
" i first came to @entity4 when i was around , i was either 9 or 10 , and we were with my dad and we went to @entity156 and we stayed at a place called the @entity158			1
" asked about whether she was running in 2016 , @entity11 said , " we are just here to support candidates , " adding later that she hopes to increase turnout with her visit			1
" if people turn out , we will actually win these midterm elections , " @entity11 said			0
" this is about the people running right now			0
" compared with @entity11 , however , @entity0 talked with reporters for a short amount of time			1
the former president entertained questions about midterm races and the future of the @entity66 before he was pulled away by aides and secret service agents			0
@entity11 also addressed his wife 's possible presidential bid			2
asked whether @entity11 was liberal enough to win @entity17 , a question raised by the fact that other presidential hopefuls such as @entity183 gov. @entity182 , @entity185 sen. @entity184 and vice president @entity186 are all coming to @entity4 with positions left of @entity0 , the former president answered affirmatively			1
" i won it twice , " @entity11 said , referring to his results in 1992 and 1996			0
" yea , i think so			0
i think what people want is somebody who is both a genuine progressive and will bring people together and produce shared prosperity			0
" asked whether @entity0 was that person , the normally wordy former president was silent			1
@entity11 returns to @entity17 : fresh start or deja vu ?			0

@entity0 tells @entity4 crowd at @entity200 : " i 'm back ! "
she says she 's thinking about 2016 run , but is there to support @entity55 candidates
some in the crowd groan and yell , " just do it ! "
