" so in february , the determined company auctioned off 20 four - story condominiums overlooking a golf course , private park and three swimming pools against a mountain backdrop			0
the upscale properties were priced as high as $ 1.6 million before the market sank			1

meanwhile , the value of existing condominiums is falling			0
the @entity100 found that the prices for existing condos has dropped nearly 16 percent since 2006			2

his research shows there is a 9.2 - month supply of condos in @entity139 -- the highest number his company has ever seen			0
a healthy market should have about five or six months of supply , he says			0
high - end shoppers will find luxury properties like the @entity159 development in @entity160 , @entity3 , which offered a free @entity1 worth $ 260,000 when buyers purchased one of the multimillion - dollar properties , said @entity164 , who managed the sales			1
" the fear factor is still holding people back , " said @entity164 , who ended the promotion this month after receiving ample inquiries but few buyers			0
in recent months , auctioning has become a popular way for developers to liquidate their properties			0
when consumers name a price , they can feel confident they are getting rock - bottom prices , said @entity179 , a @entity180 spokesman			0
auctioning also can encourage more buyers , he said			0
next month in @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity183 , a @entity185 company that handles auctions nationally , will auction units at the @entity188 , a sophisticated development with prices previously at $ 200,000 to $ 1.6 million			1
