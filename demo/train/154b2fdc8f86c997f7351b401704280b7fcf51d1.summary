on what would have been the rev. @entity3 's 86th birthday , the @entity0 decided to snub a beautiful film made about a seminal moment in his life			1
" @entity11 " did pick up two nominations , including one for best picture			1
but when the @entity13 gods consider a film to be truly great , its actors and / or actresses , screenplay and particularly its director are also recognized			2
" @entity11 " is a good film that told a great story , at least according to @entity22 voters			1
those voters are 93 % white , 76 % male and the average age is 63 , according to a 2012 analysis by the @entity27			2
but did those demographics play a role in how " @entity11 " was received ? true , the historical drama has been besieged by criticism over accuracy , particularly its portrayal of president @entity34			2
in the film , @entity3 and @entity34 are depicted as a lot more adversarial than the actual tapes of their conversation suggests			0
but it 's hard to see that being the reason for its snub : " gravity " was nominated for 10 @entity0 , won seven , and yet you wo n't find an astronaut who would describe the film as accurate			1
and " @entity50 " was also a 2014 @entity0 darling that sprinkled creative liberties all over a true story			2
race could be invoked as a factor when you remember the email exchange between two top - level @entity56 executives that became public courtesy of " @entity59 " hack			0
in it they joked about the kind of movie president @entity64 prefers and then began listing only those starring black people			0
but the two were also unkind to @entity68 in that same exchange			0
there were backstabbing remarks revealed in emails about @entity73 and @entity74 as well			0
my point is -- and i 'm sure i 'm at risk of losing my black card for writing this -- when those same old , white men made " @entity83 " a favorite of the @entity0 just a year ago , it is hard to say the snubbing of " @entity11 " is all about the demographics of the voters			1
but all ? remember , these people live in a land of make believe , where it 's normal for the inhabitants to be injected with silicone			2
oscar snubbings could come from a thousand superficial reasons , like someone sleeping with or not sleeping with the right person at the right time			0
in a town full of gay men , the heart wrenching " @entity98 " somehow lost out to the woefully mediocre " crash			0
" @entity103 's trophy case continues to sit empty			0
and i will never understand how " @entity106 " beat " @entity107 " for best picture			0
my favorite film of 2014 was " @entity113 " and i do n't think that was nominated for anything by anyone			0
it would have been wonderful to see " @entity11 " director @entity115 become the first black female director nominated for an @entity0			1
she is incredibly talented and it is always nice to be recognized by peers			0
but i do not need her to win an @entity0 to tell me how i should feel about " @entity11			1
" i do not need the @entity22 to tell me how i should spend my money at the movies			2
i do not need old , white men to validate a story so deeply personal and relevant to me today			0
that 's not to suggest @entity13 's racism should not be called out			1
only that the true story of @entity11 is much more than calling out racism			1
to paraphrase the acceptance speech @entity128 gave at the @entity129 on sunday , " @entity11 " the movie and @entity11 the historic marches are about the awakening of our humanity			1
the old guard at the @entity0 has the power to snub " @entity11 " for whatever reason it sees fit			1
but as a summer full of marches for the fight for equality reminded us , @entity13 has neither the power to snub nor the authority to validate @entity11 .			1

@entity146 : " @entity11 's " 2 @entity0 nominations seen as a snub by some ; @entity22 voters mostly white
he says calling out @entity13 racism fine , but it may not be the reasons for only 2 nods
@entity146 : i do n't need @entity22 to tell me how i feel about @entity11 , which is about awakening humanity
