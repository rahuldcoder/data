-- an alleged new case of waterboarding emerged in a massive report thursday detailing brutal @entity5 interrogations of @entity7 detainees last decade before they were handed over to @entity9 's regime			1
@entity18 " provided detailed and credible testimony that he was waterboarded on repeated occasions during @entity16 interrogations in @entity17 , " @entity10 said in a 200 - plus page report			1
the allegations directly challenge long - standing claims by president @entity21 and his administration that only three terror suspects , none of whom were @entity7 , were waterboarded during interrogations			1
human rights groups consider waterboarding -- in which a prisoner is restrained and water poured over his mouth and nose to produce the sensation of drowning -- a form of torture			0
" while never using the phrase ' waterboarding , ' he said that after his captors put a hood over his head and strapped him onto a wooden board , ' then they start with the water pouring			0
... they start to pour water to the point where you feel like you are suffocating			0
' he added that ' they would n't stop until they got some kind of answer from me , ' " the report said			2
@entity56 , a counterterrorism adviser for @entity10 and the author of the report , said abuses occurred in @entity16 - run facilities in @entity17 between april 2003 and april 2005			1
she said waterboarding occurred in 2003 but it is not clear if it occurred afterward			0
the rights group 's accusations come a week after the @entity66 closed a criminal investigation without charges into the deaths of two terror suspects in @entity5 custody			1
@entity66 wo n't prosecute @entity5 interrogators in two prisoner deaths @entity5 spokeswoman @entity74 said she could n't comment on the report 's " specific allegations " but said the @entity5 has been on record about " three substantiated cases in which detainees were subjected to the waterboarding technique			1
" " the @entity66 has exhaustively reviewed the treatment of more than 100 detainees in the post- 9/11 period -- including allegations involving unauthorized interrogation techniques -- and it declined prosecution in every case , " she said			0
among those who officials have acknowledged were subjected to waterboarding was @entity90 , described as the principal architect of the september 11 terrorist attacks			0
the @entity66 did not immediately respond to a request by @entity0 for comment on the allegations			2
@entity0 is unable to independently corroborate the claims by @entity10			1
@entity97 , a 30 - year @entity5 operations officer and director of graduate studies at @entity101 's @entity100 , said these kinds of " allegations " have been probed " countless times			1
" " if further facts are established , " he said , another investigation " to get at the truth " will occur			0
@entity97 said " accusations of torture are a part of the propaganda war " against the @entity16			1
he stressed that " lengthy " congressional probes into waterboarding identified only three people who had been victims of the practice			0
" either the @entity7 victims are making up the story , embellishing the story , or have come up with some facts that are new , " @entity97 said			2
" there could have been renegade interrogations			0
" the @entity10 report cites repeated allegations of torture by the detainees while in the custody of the @entity16 and other countries : being chained to a wall naked , forced into cramped positions , restrained in painful positions for long periods and undergoing repeated beatings			1
@entity133 and another detainee , @entity134 , also underwent water torture similar to waterboarding , the report said			2
" the scope of @entity21 administration abuse appears far broader than previously acknowledged and underscores the importance of opening up a full - scale inquiry into what happened , " @entity56 said			1
her report is titled " delivered into @entity143 : @entity16 - @entity144 and rendition of opponents to ( @entity9 's ) @entity7			1
" the report also largely relies on @entity10 interviews with former detainees , many of whom claim to have been members of the @entity152 , which was working to overthrow @entity9 in the early 1980s			2
it cites accounts of 14 former detainees and what it describes as " recently uncovered @entity5 and @entity158 documents " found in the sacked offices of @entity7 's former intelligence chief as proof of the torture and mistreatment			1
" the interviews and documents establish that , following the september 11 , 2001 attacks , the @entity16 , with aid from the @entity167 and countries in the @entity169 , @entity170 , and @entity171 arrested and held without charge a number " of @entity152 members , @entity10 said			1
they were " rendered " to @entity7 , mostly between 2004 and 2006 , when " the @entity16 and the @entity167 were trying to transform " @entity9 " from foe to ally " during their rapprochement with the dictator			1
most members of the @entity152 had fled @entity7 by the end of the 1980s and set up operations in @entity17			0
a number of the detainees were picked up in @entity17 , according to the report			0
detainees claimed to have been turned over to @entity9 and then jailed			0
some of the detainees claimed torture at the hands of @entity9 's jailers , while other said they were not mistreated			0
" all interviewees said their captors forcibly returned them to @entity7 at a time when @entity7 's record on torture made clear they would face a serious risk of abuse upon return			1
all had expressed deep fears to their captors about going back to @entity7 and five of them said that they specifically asked for asylum , " the report said			2
terror analysts say that by at least 2004 , some members of the group had aligned themselves with @entity205 , though many former members say the @entity152 had nothing to do with the terror group			0
the @entity16 classified the @entity152 as a terror organization in late 2004			0
many of the detainees , according to the report , were freed during @entity7 's civil war and fought alongside the rebels			1
" some of those who were rendered and allegedly tortured in @entity16 custody now hold key leadership and political positions in the country , " the report said			2
the documents were found by @entity10 researchers on september 3 , 2011 , in the offices of former @entity7 intelligence chief @entity224			1
in late august 2011 , @entity225 fell to rebel forces that were backed by @entity227			0
@entity9 was captured and killed by rebels in october 2011			0
one of the documents -- a fax -- offers to help @entity7 pay for an airplane to pick up a prisoner , while a @entity233 © from a @entity167 intelligence officer to @entity224 offers congratulations to @entity7 over its jailing of another former detainee handed over by the @entity167			0
" the report makes clear there 's so much that we do n't know about what happens in these places , " @entity56 said			2
" this is the tip of the iceberg			0
" she said the actions occurred during the @entity21 administration but are now the legacy of president @entity248			2
she said the @entity16 must make clear these actions should never happen again			0
" the one thing we 're hoping the report does make clear is it 's important for the @entity16 to look back and acknowledge mistakes were made , " she said			1
time : did @entity167 approve the illegal rendition , torture of @entity7 ?			2

new : an expert says torture claims have been part of an anti- @entity16 " propaganda war "
the @entity5 says it ca n't comment on the allegations in a @entity10 report
@entity10 says it has proof of @entity5 abuses against @entity7
allegations challenge claims by @entity21 's administration that only 3 people waterboarded
