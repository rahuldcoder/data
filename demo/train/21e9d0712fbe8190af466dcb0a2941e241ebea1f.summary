-- many @entity1 , including president @entity2 , have become fans of the @entity5 series " @entity6			1
" the show , starting @entity8 and @entity9 , is the story of the @entity6 majority whip who , through many devious machinations , becomes vice president of the @entity1			1
the show presents a devastating portrait of the nation 's capital in which the major players care only about advancing their careers			1
public policy and the democratic process are just vehicles for the fulfillment of @entity8 's career ambitions			2
he is willing to resort to any tactic -- even murder -- to achieve his goals			0
without question , the show is riveting			2
the writing is impressive , and the acting is phenomenal			0
it is difficult to avoid binge - watching one of the most compelling pieces of television in years			2
yet the portrait of politics that " @entity6 " provides viewers is extremely skewed , a vision so devious and so cynical that it neglects the great things that our democratic process and our leaders have produced over time			1
" even in a landscape newly populated with cynical - to - downright - nihilistic political shows , " wrote an editor for the @entity46 , the show " stands out for its unblinking commitment to a singularly dark vision of politics			1
" to be sure , politicians can be extraordinarily cold and calculating , ruthless in their pursuit of power , and some do spend almost all of their time figuring up how to move up the political ladder			1
but @entity1 politics has been much more than the world depicted in " @entity6			1
" many politicians are ruthless and calculating but use those traits for bigger objectives and sometimes will risk sacrificing their career for principle			0
while serving as @entity68 majority leader , @entity66 famously relied on his ambition and thirst for power to produce some rather notable legislative accomplishments , such as the @entity73 of 1956 and the @entity74			2
@entity66 did things that would make @entity78 gov. @entity77 cringe , but the results were often impressive			0
president @entity80 could be ruthless with his opponents , isolating them from his inner circle and castigating them in public , but his terms in office produced a @entity86 and won a world war against fascism			0
( even @entity8 's character was responsible for education reform in season one and entitlement reform in season two			2
) our political system , with these kinds of power brokers at their helm , has produced great legislation			1
during the 1930s , the @entity86 offered a federal blanket of security to @entity1 's workers -- by insuring bank accounts , providing old age pensions , regulating financial markets , legitimating industrial unions , enacting a minimum wage and more -- that have remained integral to the nation 's landscape and were a foundation for the middle class			1
during the mid- 1960s , @entity66 and the 89th @entity113 used the government to help tackle many of the big problems that faced the nation , such as providing health insurance to the elderly through @entity119 and @entity120 and guaranteeing that african - americans would not have to live in racially segregated societies through the @entity123			2
@entity1 politics is also filled with examples of great leaders			1
not everyone is as despicable as @entity128			0
in the @entity131 , the nation 's first president , @entity129 , set the bar when he voluntarily stepped down from power and demonstrated that the @entity1 would not become a monarchy			1
@entity135 guided the nation through the brutal @entity137 and brought end to the horrendous institution of slavery			1
@entity80 led @entity1 through the @entity141 and a major world war , and @entity143 , as @entity144 showed in his recent book , worked hard to calm the tension of the @entity147 and find peaceful solutions to diplomatic challenges			1
@entity150 carefully negotiated with the @entity151 through the @entity152 in 1962 , avoiding a catastrophic nuclear war , while president @entity154 seized an opportunity for peace over an arms agreement in 1987 after the emergence of @entity159 , who wanted to change the course of world history			0
there have also been great legislative leaders whose ambitions made important contributions to @entity113			2
@entity166 set the bar in the 19th century for how a legislative leader could forge compromise			0
@entity171 's @entity170 promoted many of the ideas that ultimately became the @entity86			0
his colleague @entity174 spent much of the 20th century fighting from his seat in the @entity177 to champion the cause of immigrants , workers and african - americans			0
@entity184 sen. @entity183 , a one - time isolationist , changed his tune and worked with president @entity186 to design @entity1 's @entity147 policies in the late 1940s			1
in 1964 , @entity189 sen. @entity188 , a staunch conservative , convinced a large bloc of fellow @entity192 to come around to vote in favor of ending the filibuster against the @entity123			0
rep. @entity195 brought the energy he developed during the civil rights movement to the halls of @entity113 , defending the @entity199 during the 1980s and 1990s			0
great ideas have also come out of @entity201 rather than the private sector			1
during the 19th century , the belief in public investment , the idea that the federal government should help create a national infrastructure to connect communities , took hold as public funds were used to build roads and create a mail system			0
between the 1940s and 1960s , the federal government championed the cause of computing technology and space exploration at a time when neither seemed very profitable to most in the private sector			0
a number of politicians , such as @entity222 ( and future vice president ) @entity223 , were central to promoting the idea of racial equality			0
so although " @entity6 " is a great show , viewers need to remember that politics is much more than that			1
we have become so cynical in this day and age that we can no longer see what is good about our democratic system			0
the history of our country reveals that this democratic process can also produce great things			0
@entity201 is more than a power game : it is a town where those in power have the potential to make important changes and contributions to our history			1
and sometimes , they have done just that			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity252 .			2

@entity252 : @entity5 show depicts @entity201 in which power is used ruthlessly
he says the show is compelling but *paints* too dark a portrait of the nation 's capital
political leaders used power to end *threats* and attain social justice , he says
@entity252 : enjoy show , but do *n't* take it as statement about limits of @entity1 politics
