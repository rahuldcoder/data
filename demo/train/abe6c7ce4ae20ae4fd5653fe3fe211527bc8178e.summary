-- an @entity2 jury on friday found the @entity3 liable for the sexual abuse of a 12 - year - old boy more than 25 years ago , returning a verdict of $ 18.5 million in punitive damages			1
the plaintiff , @entity8 , now 38 , allowed his name to be used publicly during the trial , according to his attorneys			1
he is among six men suing the @entity3 over allegations of sexual abuse			1
attorney @entity15 has said that when his clients were boys during the 1980s , the organization knew that at least one of them had been abused by former assistant @entity19			1
the 53 - year - old convicted sex offender was released from prison in 2005 and paroled until 2013			0
he could not be reached on friday			0
@entity15 also alleged that though the scout leader was removed , he was allowed to stay on as a volunteer and the abuse continued			1
in 1983 , @entity19 told troop leaders he abused 17 scouts , according to plaintiff 's attorneys			2
during the six - week trial , @entity15 produced documents that he said were part of an archive of previously secret @entity34 files that chronicled decades of abuse of boys			1
earlier this month , jurors in @entity38 awarded @entity8 $ 1.4 million after finding that the organization was negligent in allowing a @entity34 leader who was a sex offender to have contact with him			1
under @entity2 law , 60 percent of a punitive damages award goes to the state 's crime victims ' fund			0
the @entity3 did not immediately respond to @entity0 's requests for comment on friday			1
however , lawyers for the organization have said it had not known about the scout leader 's record			2
once the @entity3 did learn about it , the organization acted immediately and cooperated with police , the lawyers have said			1
the @entity3 have acknowledged the organization does have confidential files , but said they are made confidential in order to protect people who are ineligible to be scout leaders , but who may not have done anything illegal			1

" the safety of the young people currently in the @entity84 has never been in question during these legal proceedings			0
the case focused on a discussion about what society and the @entity3 knew about child abuse approximately three decades ago			1
" this is a long - standing societal issue that every youth - serving organization must address			0
based on the standard of care of that time , the @entity3 believes it acted responsibly and that the evidence presented during the trial does not justify the verdict			2
" while holding the @entity3 60 percent negligent , the jury said the @entity100 -- which oversees scouting activities in the region -- was 15 percent negligent and the @entity103 25 percent negligent			2
the church has sponsored a number of @entity34 troops , including the one to which the plaintiff belonged			0
@entity109 , a lawyer representing the church , has said the verdict has no impact on the church , since it settled the case out of court more than a year ago			0
" the church absolutely condemns any kind of child abuse , " he said			0
" because of the way the law is set up in @entity2 , we thought it made sense both to help the victim and also to get this behind the victim and us to settle this case			0
