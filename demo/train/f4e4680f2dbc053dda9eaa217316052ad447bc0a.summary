-- on a cold , rainy night in late november , @entity1 sat amid brambles and thick @entity4 underbrush , watching over the body of his 28 - year - old son , @entity6 , who had disappeared almost three weeks earlier			1
" his spirits got to me : ' daddy , i knew you would find me , ' " @entity1 says , recalling the relief that had washed over him			0
@entity14 sheriff 's deputies had searched for @entity15 but did n't find him , and volunteer searchers later found his body , his family says			1
a medical examiner says the death was accidental , but the family rejects that notion , citing what a different pathologist says appears to be " severe trauma " to his body			1
the @entity25 and @entity26 are investigating			1
@entity15 was last seen around dusk on november 7			1
the physical therapist was on his way to treat a patient			0
he had been having trouble with his pickup and pulled into @entity33 , one of the few stores along an isolated stretch of @entity36			0
he called his wife , @entity37 , and gave her directions to the store			2
because their two young sons were home sick , she called his parents , who immediately left on the hourlong drive			2
what happened next changed everything			0
" the last time i called him , i just heard heavy breathing			2
he was in distress of some sort			0
he was not responding to anything i was saying , " @entity53 says			0
around 6 p.m. , @entity15 disappeared from where he was last seen alive			1
when his parents arrived about 20 minutes later , his truck was in the parking lot , but he was nowhere to be seen			0
his father asked the store clerk what happened			0
he says she told him that she was out having a smoke when @entity1 " all of a sudden put his cell phone in his sock and took off like the truck was going to blow up			0
" the clerk did not want to be interviewed on camera but did tell @entity0 that @entity1 " left on his own free will , " a phrase she repeated several times			0
the next day , his personal effects , including his watch and @entity74 , turned up on a nearby ranch			0
deputies searched the property with cadaver dogs			0
his family says it was told by the deputies that @entity1 's scent had " disappeared " at a nearby creek			1
four days after @entity1 vanished , @entity14 sheriff @entity83 called off the search , telling the family , " your son 's just a missing person			1
we 've exhausted our resources and funds			0
we 're done , " family lawyer @entity93 says			2
family members say the sheriff told them that " there was no foul play " and that @entity1 's disappearance was probably " drug - related , " most likely related to methamphetamine			1
the sheriff 's daughter and @entity1 apparently knew each other through their health care jobs , which made the sheriff 's actions even more surprising to the @entity107 , who were left to search for their son on their own			2
he had been missing for 19 days when , during @entity111 week , dozens of volunteers did their own search in the cold and rain			1
@entity1 's body was found nearly three weeks after his truck broke down , in an area of the ranch supposedly already searched by deputies			1
' he was neatly laid ' walking to the spot , @entity1 describes the position in which his son lay : " his head was in this area , and his feet was back here			0
he was just , if i might say , he was neatly laid			0
" @entity15 was wearing only boxer shorts , tennis shoes and a single sock , inside of which was his cell phone , just as the clerk had described			1
the second sock was under the body			2
" i was told by the mortician at the autopsy that when they pulled off his left sock , his keys was under his left foot in his shoe , " his father says			0
" what was weird about his sock , " says his father , is that it " was clean , and his sock was pulled up with his phone stuck in it as if he was in a sunday school class			0
his tennis shoes was very clean			0
" and not just the position of the body seemed strange			2
" this is the first thing i noticed -- how smooth his forearms and his back was			0
no scratches at all , " his father says			0
after just one day , he and the other volunteers were caked in mud and their clothing torn from brambles , he says			2
@entity15 was missing an ear , two front teeth , and his throat appeared to be cut			1
the medical examiner attributed the trauma to " animal and insect activity			0
" what 's more , in an echo of the sheriff 's prediction , the coroner 's toxicology report described @entity1 's body as filled with drugs -- cocaine , meth and amphetamines			1
his death was ruled " accidental " due to a " combined drug intoxication			1
" his family does n't believe it			2
family members say they never saw him do drugs , nor had his personality changed to suggest he was using drugs			1
they say he was the fun - loving , hardworking father he had always been			0
they want to know if the drugs entered his body while he was missing			1
suspicious of the investigation , the family hired their own pathologist , who ultimately did a separate autopsy and , contrary to the medical examiner , found what appears to be " severe trauma to the neck and head			2
" a month after @entity1 's body was found , @entity83 handed the investigation over to the @entity25			1
they have called the death " questionable " and say the autopsy is just one part of an active investigation			1
the week @entity0 was in @entity14 , the @entity25 announced they had called in the @entity26 to assist			1
after @entity15 's death , wife @entity37 went through bank records			1
she found three charges her husband made at local hotels when she and the children were away the month before he died			0
@entity25 are pulling video from one of the hotels to review it for possible evidence			2
feds , family seek answers a year after teen 's mysterious death @entity0 's @entity219 contributed to this report			1

@entity15 was missing for almost three weeks before volunteers found his body
a coroner 's report says his body was filled with drugs , and his death was ruled accidental
family members say they never saw him do drugs , nor did his personality suggest that he did
@entity25 say the death is questionable and have called in the @entity26 to help investigate
