everyone agrees -- the mysterious death of @entity4 prosecutor @entity3 has all the twists of a thriller			1
but what exactly does that mean ? a number of people have been pulled into the unfolding story of the prosecutor 's death			1
@entity3 , a special prosecutor investigating a deadly 1994 terror attack , alleged that the country 's president , foreign minister and other political leaders covered up @entity20 involvement in the attack			1
the government told @entity20 it would back off in exchange for a favorable trade deal , @entity3 alleged			1
he filed his report , but one day before his scheduled testimony before lawmakers on the allegations , he was found dead from a gunshot wound to the head			2
there were initial reports of suicide , but many had their doubts			0
sure enough , suspicions appeared to be confirmed when no gunpowder residue was found on @entity3 's hands , which would have been expected if he had shot himself			1
since then , a number of strange things have happened in @entity4 , all seemingly related to @entity3 's death			1
here 's a look at the people , events and places that form part of a web that continues to unspool : the @entity48 , or @entity49 , was the target of the july 18 , 1994 , terror attack that killed 85 people and injured hundreds in @entity53			1
the attack on the @entity55 is the worst terror attack in @entity4 's history			1
a suicide attacker drove an explosive - laden vehicle into the building			0
@entity4 has the largest jewish community in @entity62			1
he was the prosecutor who accused @entity4 's president and other top leaders of covering up @entity20 's alleged role in the @entity55 center bombing			1
@entity3 was found dead after filing a report with his allegations in court , and one day before he was slated to testify on his accusations in front of @entity73			1
his death remains a mystery			2
a gun and shell casing by his side made it look like a suicide , but an initial test found no gunpowder residue on his hands			0
almost immediately , suspicions arose that @entity3 's death was linked to his allegations against the president , foreign minister and other political elites			1
president @entity90 called it a suicide , then quickly changed her tune			2
the government denies it had a role in the prosecutor 's death			1
@entity3 was appointed as special prosecutor on the @entity49 bombing in 2005 by then - president @entity100 , @entity101 's late husband			1
even before @entity3 became the lead investigator , previous @entity4 prosecutors suspected @entity20 's involvement in the terrorist attack			1
in 2004 , @entity4 issued arrest warrants for 12 @entity20 and requested that @entity107 issue red notices for these suspects			2
but allegations of misconduct by @entity4 investigators resulted in the case falling apart			1
@entity3 was appointed after this mess to sort it out			2
@entity3 's own investigation also pointed at @entity20 , and in 2007 , @entity4 issued new arrest warrants and went back to @entity107			1
this time six red notices were issued			0
the @entity20 suspects are @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125			0
the most prominent of these suspects is @entity124 , who for a time was @entity20 's defense minister			2
@entity4 also asked for red notices for three others -- former @entity20 president @entity129 , former foreign affairs minister @entity130 and @entity131 , the former ambassador of @entity20 in @entity53			1
@entity107 did not issue red notices for them			0
none of the @entity20 suspects are in custody and @entity20 has not made them available to @entity4 prosecutors			2
in 2013 , @entity4 's @entity73 approved the creation of a joint commission to investigate the 1994 @entity49 bombing			1
the five - member " truth commission " would include @entity4 and @entity20 investigators who would work together to get to the bottom of the terror attack			1
@entity4 lawmakers deliberated for more than 14 hours before passing the measure by a 131 - 113 vote			2
later , @entity3 would call this agreement the public face of the alleged cover - up			2
@entity101 's government heralded the agreement as a way for prosecutors to finally interrogate the @entity20 suspects			0
but there was much opposition , including from @entity55 groups			0
they were worried the commission 's verdict would be nonbinding and distrusted @entity20			0
@entity101 was elected president of @entity4 in 2007			1
she succeeded her husband , @entity100 , who was president from 2003 - 2007 and who died in 2010			0
@entity101 was re-elected in december 2011 to a new four - year term			0
as president , she has often been combative , accusing opponents of undermining her ability to govern			0
when @entity3 was found dead , she made a statement calling it a suicide , followed by a second statement saying she did n't believe he took his own life			2
in the wake of the @entity3 scandal , @entity101 traveled to @entity173 on a business trip , where she made headlines for a tweet mocking the @entity173 accent			2
@entity179 , @entity4 's foreign minister , is among those accused of conspiring to cover up @entity20 's involvement in the @entity55 center bombing			1
after @entity3 's death , @entity179 told @entity1 the allegations of a cover - up were baseless			1
@entity101 's government has done more than any previous administration to get to the bottom of the bombing , @entity179 said			0
" i am @entity55 , " he said			0
" and to think that a person of my religion , the @entity55 religion , can make a deal not to prosecute the death of 85 people , most of them @entity55 in @entity4 ... i have to tell you , it 's not easy to live with			1
" he has said that he never asked to have the red notices for the @entity20 suspects removed			0
his reputation has taken a hit			0
@entity179 signed the agreement with the @entity20 to investigate the bombing jointly , a move criticized by @entity4 's jewish community			1
at the time , he said : " i negotiated this memorandum with who i had to , not with who i wanted to			0
at each step , i kept in mind that us @entity4 learned with lots of pain that we have to seek justice and not condemnations , to seek the truth and not vengeance			2
" @entity217 was an assistant to @entity3			2
he also is the only person charged in connection with the prosecutor 's death , charged with illegally letting @entity3 borrow a gun			1
@entity222 faces up to six years in prison if convicted			0
the it expert broke his silence at a news conference , saying he committed no crime and that he let @entity3 borrow the gun at the prosecutor 's insistence			1
@entity3 feared for his safety after he filed his report in court and did n't trust his own security guards , @entity217 said			2
according to @entity222 , @entity3 was so fearful that he did n't go out to buy his own groceries and feared for his daughters			2
@entity3 told @entity217 not to worry , that he was n't going to use the gun			2
but when @entity222 texted later to check on @entity3 , the prosecutor never answered			1
@entity238 is a federal prosecutor who leads the investigation into @entity3 's death			1
it 's not unusual for her , or those she interviews , to be swarmed by television news cameras outside her office			0
@entity238 's approach to the investigation has been careful and transparent			0
she provides occasional statements with updates on whom she has spoken with and what tests are being conducted on the evidence			0
however , she made missteps that have damaged her credibility in the eyes of some			0
when the @entity257 newspaper reported that @entity3 had drafted an arrest warrant affidavit for @entity101 , @entity259 and others , @entity238 was quoted saying it was not true			2
the government also denied it			0
the next day , @entity238 said her comments were misunderstood			0
she confirmed that @entity3 had indeed contemplated seeking the arrests of the president and others			1
the draft documents were found in trash can in @entity3 's apartment , she said			1
the @entity270 , or @entity271 , is the country 's domestic intelligence service			0
locally , it is also known as @entity275 , referring to the agency 's previous name , the @entity278 ( side by its @entity281 initials )			0
in the wake of @entity3 's death , the government has suggested that rogue intelligence agents fed @entity3 false information about a cover - up and then killed him after he filed the accusations in court			1
" they used him while he was alive , and then they needed him dead , " the president said in a statement days after @entity3 's body was found			1
@entity101 then sent a bill to @entity73 that would abolish the @entity271 and replace it with a new agency , to be called the @entity299			0
the @entity271 has " not served the interests of the country , " @entity101 said			0
lawmakers are debating the proposal			0
@entity304 is his full name , but he is known by his nickname , " @entity307			0
" he is a key witness , but he seems to have disappeared			0
when @entity101 refers to a rogue intelligence officer who fed false information to @entity3 , she is talking about @entity304			2
@entity304 led the @entity271 until @entity101 booted him last year			0
the former spy chief allegedly retaliated by tricking @entity3 into accusing the government of a criminal cover - up , @entity101 and her supporters claim			2
@entity101 moved to relieve @entity304 of his obligation to keep secrets , so that he can testify			0
@entity304 was slated to testify during the first week of february but could n't be found			0
fein has since said she is confident he will testify soon			0
@entity319 is a journalist for the english - language @entity320			0
a dual citizen of @entity4 and @entity323 , he broke the news of @entity3 's death , reporting it via @entity326			1
after the scoop , @entity319 dropped off the radar , with some saying he fled @entity4 fearing for his safety			2
in a strange response , the @entity4 government published a copy of @entity319 's travel records , saying they showed he simply went to @entity335 and had purchased a return ticket			1
but @entity319 did n't return			0
he announced on @entity326 a few days later that he was in @entity323 , in exile			0
@entity338 is @entity4 's security secretary			1
his tie - in to this mystery ? local media widely reported that he arrived at @entity3 's apartment , with @entity3 's mother , before investigators arrived			1
he also was the first person to publicly call @entity3 's death a suicide			1
not surprisingly , questions have swirled about what a government minister was doing at the scene before the investigators , and why he announced the suicide theory so quickly .			0
