@entity0 , @entity1 -- a former teacher with no formal business qualifications , @entity3 cuts an unusual figure as the head of a major electricity company			1
but then her company , the @entity9 ( @entity10 ) -- based in the hills of a remote @entity1 town -- is not your typical electricity supplier			1
founded by @entity3 and a few friends in 1991 , @entity10 is a citizen - owned co-operative that powers 120,000 homes across @entity1 , using only sustainable energy supplies			1
today , following the nuclear explosion in @entity21 and @entity1 's subsequent commitment to end its reliance on nuclear power over the next decade , @entity10 is enjoying rocketing demand , and expects to provide for a million homes by 2015			1
not bad for a self - professed housewife , who wrest control of her local electricity grid from the nationwide energy provider			1
@entity3 's story starts in 1986 , in the wake of the @entity33			1
although her home in @entity37 was over 2,000 kilometers away from the nuclear plant explosion , traces of radiation had still managed to infect the local wildlife			0
" at first we thought : what can the children eat ? can they play outdoors , " she recalls			0
" and we still have this now , when you go into the forest , the mushrooms are still polluted ; the wild boar is still polluted ... 25 years after @entity33 , that is still here			2
" @entity3 , a mother of five , established " @entity50 " -- a regional organization aimed at promoting alternatives to nuclear energy			2
at the time , @entity3 believed that @entity53 , the power company responsible for providing her town with its electricity , could be persuaded to invest in sustainable supplies and even help its people reduce their reliance on the grid			1
" they told us : ' you want to save energy ? we sell energy			0
we 'll not help you			0
' we learned that neither the government nor the energy supplier would do anything			0
" it was exactly this response that spurred @entity3 and others living in @entity37 into what they did next			2
" we never thought about overtaking a grid and doing what we 're now doing , " says @entity3			1
" their attitude was the reason why we wanted to			0
" and so , when @entity53 's licence to operate the power grid came up for renewal in 1991 , @entity3 and her group created their own power - company and launched a local petition to convince the town council and the population to let them manage it cooperatively			1
after many years and battles , in 1997 , @entity10 had raised enough money -- about â ‚ ¬ 2 million -- to buy the contract to supply @entity89 with non-nuclear electricity			0
collectively owned by 1,000 citizens , the company gets all its energy from green sources , mainly hydropower operations , but also including solar panels and wind turbines			2
some homes even have small co-generation systems that produce domestic heat as well as electricity that can be sold back to the grid			2
so do @entity10 customers pay a premium to keep a clean and green conscience ? nope			0
in fact , according to @entity3 , they pay less			2
" we 're offering ( electricity ) even cheaper than companies which supply their customers with nuclear power or with coal power , " she says			0
" that is because we do n't want to gain as much money as the others do			0
of course , we have to gain money as well because we have people who work for us ... but we just do n't want to gain as much ... that 's not the reason why we do ( it )			0
" indeed , the company 's shareholders receive small dividends , as well as an income from any home - generated power they put back into the grid , but the rest is reinvested into new renewable energy projects and into training and supporting communities who want to run their own green energy companies			1
it 's for these reasons that @entity3 was named @entity138 winner of the 2011 @entity139 , often cited as the " @entity140 for the environment , " in april of this year			1
not many energy barons can boast one of those .			0

@entity3 created @entity1 's first co-op - owned renewable power company
motivated to *protect* her family after @entity33 , @entity3 took control of local power grid
her company charges less for electricity as it does not aim to make a profit
@entity3 was recently awared *prestigious* @entity139 prize
