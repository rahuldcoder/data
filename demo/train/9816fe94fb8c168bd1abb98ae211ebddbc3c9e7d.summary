@entity0 said it 's hard not to see his three daughters in the eyes of the girls he helps on his visits to the poverty stricken villages in @entity8			1
@entity10 's dr. @entity9 sat down with @entity0 and his water.org co-founder , @entity11 , to talk about what their organization is hoping to achieve by providing clean water and sanitation to those who need it			1
" our daughters in that situation would be off looking for a water source and hauling water for the family and they would have no prospects for a life or a future , " @entity0 said			1
on premises access to clean water is something only one in four people have in @entity8 , according to @entity31			1
when @entity0 got into the water business , he worked with @entity33 and says he learned a lot			1
" i did what i think a lot of people do , which is they kind of get right into the direct impact , like well - digging and how many people can i help if i dig x number of wells , " @entity0 said			1
but he said as his understanding of the issue grew , he realized that charity was n't going to solve the problem			0
together , we can solve the water crisis he teamed with @entity11 , co-founder of @entity48 , in july 2009 and water.org was born			2
" had i stayed with just drilling wells , i 'd have reached thousands of people at this point , but by the end of next year we 'll hit 3 million people that we 've reached this way , " @entity0 said			1
@entity57 is a nonprofit focused on giving access to clean water and sanitation to more of the developing world			1
what makes the organization different is its @entity64 , which provides new financing options for poor people so they can pay for a toilet in their home or connect to an existing water supply			2
@entity11 said he met women in @entity8 who were paying 125 % interest to loan sharks to get their own toilet or to connect to the public water utilities			1
they inspired him to create the @entity64 initiative			0
now , he said , these women can get a loan at a much lower rate and still get access to these services			2
" so , basically we helped microfinance institutions really discover a new market among some of their existing clients and now we 've had over 1.6 million people get access to water and sanitation not through charity but through a microloan			1
and they 're being repaid at 99 % , " @entity11 said			0
in a lot of urban areas the infrastructure already exists			0
water pumps right under the feet of people who just ca n't connect to it			2
" it was the recognition that there was a market there for this , and that if we just stopped looking at people as beneficiaries , if we look at them as customers , then we can really unleash their power to solve their own problems , " @entity0 said			1
@entity0 's passion about water is spilling into every aspect of his life			1
he 's using his celebrity and sense of humor to help spread the word			2
when he took part in the ice bucket challenge , he did it with toilet water			0
before that he proclaimed a strike on toilets , saying " until everybody has access to clean water and sanitation , i will not go to the bathroom			1
" his goal to empower people is serious			0
he said by gaining access to water and toilets , women and girls gain their time and life back			2
for many , collecting and scavenging for water is a large part of their day			0
freed from those duties they can find a job and earn money to help repay the loan			0
desperate , disgusted but proud -- @entity8 's human waste removers " it is an income - enhancing loan because you 're basically buying their time back , and they can work , right ? " @entity0 said			1
" this is an incredible deal if you 're the lender			0
" it also brings extra security to girls and women , who no longer have to leave their home to use the bathroom			0
" i mean this news that came out of @entity8 this summer with the two girls who did n't have access to toilets in their home , so they had to wait until the cover of night because of the dignity of this issue , to go out and find a place to defecate			1
and while they were out they were raped and murdered , " @entity11 said			0
" that 's just unbelievable that something so basic to humanity like access to sanitation should set up these situations			0
" some 36 % of the world 's population , 2.5 billion people , lacks improved sanitation facilities , and 768 million people still use unsafe drinking water sources , according to the @entity184			1
the long - term health effects of not having access to water include malnutrition and diarrhea			2
according to @entity31 , diarrhea is the second largest cause of death in children under 5 globally and responsible for 600,000 children 's deaths each year			0
it 's also associated with a higher risk of stunting ( low weight for age and developmental delay )			0
many other diseases , such as malaria and other parasitic diseases , could be prevented with an adequate water supply , sanitation facilities and proper hygiene , according to the @entity184			1
that 's also why education is a key component of @entity57 's mission			0
it teaches people about proper hand washing with soap , and is helping people make the connection between hygiene and sickness			0
it teaches how to store water , avoid contaminating it with utensils and how to practice good hygiene by washing hands before preparing food and after changing a diaper			0
" the practice of hand washing with soap in @entity8 is not widespread			2
a study showed that only 53 % of the population wash hands with soap after defecation , 38 % before eating , and 30 % before preparing food , " according to @entity31			0
@entity235 and @entity236 share @entity237 " it 's an absolute , just white - knuckle crisis right now for three - quarters of a billion people , " @entity0 said			2
" it 's killing a child every 20 seconds , which is unfathomable that these children are dying from things like diarrhea , which you know , if you have kids , your kid gets a stomach bug , maybe they miss a day of school			0
but , you know , it 's hard for us in the @entity256 to even wrap our brains around this concept that a lack of access to clean water and sanitation is literally slaughtering children by the millions , just because none of them are dying here			1

only 1 in 4 people in @entity8 have access to clean water
actor @entity0 is using his celebrity to bring attention to the dire need for water
768 million people still use unsafe drinking water sources , according to the @entity184
