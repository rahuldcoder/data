-- @entity1 is waiting to welcome the world for the biggest football tournament on the planet -- but has it taken its eye off the greatest show on earth -- the @entity9 ? the @entity11 nation was shamed tuesday after international olympic vice president @entity12 claimed @entity14 's preparations for the @entity15 was the " worst " he had ever witnessed			1
@entity12 , who has been involved in the @entity9 for nearly 40 years , has made six trips to @entity14 as part of the commission involved in ensuring the @entity1 city is ready to host the @entity15			1
and while the @entity22 , which starts on june 12 may take priority , @entity1 's ability to juggle two huge events has been called into question			1
" it 's the worst that i 've experienced , " he said in a statement ahead of a press conference in @entity28 , @entity29 , where he was being asked about preparations for 2016			0
" we have become very concerned			0
they are not ready in many , many ways			0
" we have to make it happen and that is the @entity38 approach			2
you ca n't walk away from this			0
" @entity12 revealed tuesday that the @entity38 has taken " unprecedented " action by placing experts in the local organizing committee to ensure the @entity15 go ahead			1
but in a statement issued tuesday , the @entity14 organizing committee insisted the city will host an " excellent games that will be delivered absolutely within the agreed timelines and budget			1
" the committee also cited the recent announcement of the budget for both infrastructure and legacy projects , as well as the tender process for @entity57 venues , as signs of progress			0
the statement added : " the time has now passed when general discussions about the progress of preparations contribute to the journey towards the @entity15			0
" the work being undertaken in partnership with the three levels of government -- federal , state and city -- is delivering progress			0
" the support of the @entity38 is also crucial			2
we have a historic mission : to organize the first @entity9 and @entity76 in @entity1 and in @entity11			2
we are going to achieve this			0
" ongoing concerns have prompted the @entity38 to agree to increase the frequency of visits -- led by @entity9 executive director @entity81 -- and establish dedicated task forces			2
@entity14 organizers announced earlier this month that @entity1 will spend 24.1 billion reais ( $ 10.8 billion ) on infrastructure projects to ensure the @entity15 are delivered on time			1
@entity87 mayor @entity86 also stated that he was looking forward to @entity81 's visit saying that there was " no reason for concern " and that the " @entity57 has nothing delayed			0
" but @entity12 says the delays in construction and the lack of information available means the current state in @entity14 is worse than that seen in @entity99 in 2004			1
" the @entity38 has adopted a more hands - on role , " said @entity12			1
" it is unprecedented for the @entity38 but there is no @entity104 we are going to @entity14			1
" but in a statement sent to @entity0 late tuesday , the @entity38 appeared to play down @entity12 ' comments			1
" working together with our partners in @entity14 we have put in place a number of measures to support the @entity15 , " said the statement			2
" mr @entity81 has received a very positive response on the ground in the past few days , and a number of recent developments show that things are moving in the right direction			0
" now is a time to look forward to work together and to deliver great games for @entity14 , @entity1 and for the world , and not to engage in discussion of the past			1
" we continue to believe that @entity14 is capable of providing outstanding games			2
" @entity1 army occupies @entity14 shantytown ahead of @entity22 the lead up to the @entity124 10 years ago was marred by construction delays and service delivery , but the venues and infrastructure were delivered on time			1
like @entity99 , @entity14 is experiencing similar problems			1
the games , which are being held in @entity11 for the first time in its history , have been beset by delays , soaring costs and bad communication			0
@entity12 has also voiced concerns that the @entity38 was unable to get the reassurances needed from the local organizing committee			1
" no - one is able to give answers at the moment , " he said			0
" can they use the car parks in the village for recovery centers ? what will be the time to take from this venue to this venue ? " all of those things , they 're being fobbed off			0
" @entity12 also claimed that only two people were working in @entity14 's test event department with tournaments scheduled to start this year			2
