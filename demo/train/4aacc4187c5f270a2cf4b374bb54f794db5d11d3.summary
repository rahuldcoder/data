-- march 26 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 , @entity6 @entity7 , @entity8 transcript this is a @entity11			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			1
@entity15 , @entity16 : fridays are acceptable ! just does n't have the same ring , especially on the most awesome day of the week ! well , i 'm @entity20			1
i welcome you to @entity0 ; we 're kicking things off right now ! first up : health care @entity24 : first up , follow the bouncing health care bill : it 's in the @entity27 , then the @entity28 , then the @entity27 again			1
it 's hard to keep up with			1
but another health care reform bill -- the set of changes to the legislation that 's already law -- moved move from the @entity28 back to the @entity27 yesterday			1
now the @entity27 , as you might remember , had dealt with this legislation before			1
but because the @entity28 made adjustments to it , the @entity27 had to pass the new version			1
well , it did last night , and it will become law when president @entity40 signs it			1
it 'll cost more than $ 60 billion in addition to the $ 875 billion health reform law			1
@entity44 leaders had put these changes on the fast track			1
part of the reason for the quick turnaround is recess			1
@entity50 is scheduled to start its two - week @entity52 break today			1
meanwhile , president @entity40 is working to convince the @entity54 people of the benefits of the health care law he 's already signed			1
here , you see him speaking at an event in @entity4 yesterday			1
but there have been some strong reactions to this law and to the political debate surrounding the entire health care issue			1
and those reactions have raised concerns about security for some members of @entity50			1
threatening messages , vandalized offices , even gunshots fired at one congressman 's campaign office			1
it 's been reported by @entity44 and @entity74 , and leaders of both fo those parties are speaking out against it			1
@entity80 @entity79 , ( r ) minority leader : i know many @entity54 are angry over this health care bill and angry at @entity44 here in @entity85 for not listening			1
but as i 've said before , violence and threats are unacceptable			1
they have no place in a political debate			2
@entity80 @entity91 , ( @entity92 ) majority whip : we 're giving aid and comfort to these people , and this stuff gets ratcheted up			2
we in this @entity50 have got to come together in a bipartisan way and tamp this foolishness down			2
do n't ask @entity24 : okay , moving from health care to another controversial issue			2
teachers , you might want to preview this next segment			2
it deals with the military 's controversial " @entity110 " policy			2
it 's a law ; went into effect in 1993			2
it keeps gays and lesbians from openly serving in the @entity54 military			2
the @entity40 administration wants to end the law , and defense secretary @entity119 is already taking steps toward doing that			2
now , some military officials are concerned about the impact that getting rid of the law will have on troops			2
secretary @entity119 says there 's a lot to consider			2
@entity119 , @entity54 defense secretary : i do not recommend a change in the law before we have completed our study			2
there is a great deal we do n't know about this in terms of the views of our service members , in terms of the views of their families and influencers			2
there is a lot we have to address in terms of what would be required in the way of changed regulations , in terms of benefits			2
@entity151 @entity152 , @entity16 : today 's shoutout goes out to mr. @entity155 's classes at @entity156 in @entity157 , @entity158 ! where would you find the world 's tallest building ? you know what to do ! is it : a ) @entity5 , b ) @entity166 , c ) @entity168 or @entity169 ) @entity170 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! @entity5 is currently home to the world 's tallest building , the @entity173			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! debt crisis @entity24 : you might 've been able to tell from that map we had in that shoutout : @entity5 is in the @entity6 , so this next story takes place in the @entity183			1
the company that built the @entity173 is called @entity185 , and it 's getting a $ 9.5 billion bailout from the government of @entity5			1
now that 's important , because @entity5 world owes more than $ 23 billion in debt			1
the @entity173 , it 's towering ; you see it here			2
it cost $ 1.5 billion			2
@entity185 has also spent money to build artificial islands and luxury homes			2
@entity5 is a very wealthy part of the world			1
financial experts thought it would n't be affected by the global financial crisis			2
but , like everywhere , it was			2
last november , @entity185 said it was having problems paying off that multi-billion dollar debt			2
and now , the company says it could take 5 to 8 years to pay everything off in full			1
@entity207 @entity24 : as @entity0 celebrates @entity207 , we want to wish a happy birthday to @entity210			1
she was born on march 26th -- today ! -- in 1930			0
her birthplace : @entity213 , @entity214			0
while serving in the @entity216 state senate , @entity210 became the majority leader			0
she was the first woman in @entity54 history to hold that position			0
that 's not her only famous first			0
in 1981 , @entity210 was nominated to serve on the @entity54 @entity221 , and she became the first female , @entity221 justice			0
exploring the achievements of women in government , like @entity210 , just one of the activities in our @entity207 materials			1
you can find them in the @entity234 section			1
the address is everybody 's favorite web site : @entity238			0
is this legit ? @entity239 , @entity16 : is this legit ? the limbic system is the part of the human brain that controls emotions			0
legit ! it includes the amygdala and hippocampus			0
@entity248 @entity24 : so , the emotions that are controlled by your limbic system do n't just affect how you feel			0
they can play a role in how you act and what kinds of decisions you make			0
yesterday , we talked about creative intelligence			1
there 's also something called emotional intelligence ; it 's learning about your feelings and how to manage them			1
but should those lessons be taught in school ? that is the question that @entity266 now considers			1
( begin video ) @entity268 , @entity0 correspondent : along with math and science ... @entity271 , @entity272 hills middle school : and so , what you 're going to do is put on your blindfolds			1
@entity277 : ... this is part of the curriculum at @entity280 near @entity7			0
@entity281 : when everyone has their blindfolds on , i 'm going to have three people take off their blindfolds			0
@entity277 : an exercise in boosting self - esteem			0
@entity281 : tap two people who you think can make you laugh			0
@entity291 # 1 : it 's a different kind of enjoyment than a subject			0
it 's more like a spirit lifter , and it makes you feel good inside			0
@entity277 : but what does that have to do with being smart ? @entity300 , @entity301 , " @entity302 " : i think that 's a horrible idea			0
do you get graded then for being angry ? i mean , what does that mean in terms of real life ? @entity311 , professor of psychology at the @entity312 , author , " @entity248 " : emotional intelligence is a different way of being smart			1
@entity277 : @entity316 , professor of psychology at the @entity318 , is the man behind the groundbreaking research on which the best - selling book " @entity248 " is based			0
the concept : @entity248 is just as important as iq			0
@entity316 says it turns out kids who get good social and emotional training score 11 percentage points higher on tests than kids who do n't			1
why ? why ? @entity329 : well , i think there are a variety of reasons			0
they can overcome obstacles when they reach them			0
some of this involves academic tenacity , teaching kids self - discipline and self - control			0
@entity277 : a learning process that starts in kindergarten			0
these are second graders role - playing			0
@entity291 # 2 : i feel proud because i just learned how to draw a dinosaur in computer lab. @entity291 # 3 : that is great			0
can you teach me ? @entity291 # 2 : yes			0
@entity277 : what is the real world benefit of this ? @entity329 : one real world benefit is kids behave better in school			1
another real world benefit is they 're less likely to fight			0
another benefit is they 're less likely to do drugs			0
@entity362 , elementary school social worker : i believe that this is the future			1
these children are our future			0
and so , i believe by teaching them this , they will be the leaders			0
@entity277 : research also shows great leaders tend to be funny and the best doctors are empathetic			0
but can emotional intelligence be taught ? should it be ? @entity375 : you 're not telling me that you ca n't learn how to behave with your peers ? @entity277 : what you 're saying is , do we really need a class for this ? @entity375 : i do n't think we need a class for this			1
@entity277 : others argue getting along is just as important as getting good grades , and that the really smart thrive at both			0
@entity329 : this is not academics versus social and emotional development			1
that 's a false choice			0
this is teaching kids to be socially , emotionally and academically skilled			0
( @entity393 ) before we go @entity24 : before we go , we 're about to run wild ! as if horses are n't supposed to hang out in a parking lot ! maybe it 's some sort of " no loitering " rule			0
or is it the first cross-species game of tag ? no , that 's it			0
it sounds a lot more interesting than " horses run wild , humans hilariously give chase			0
" the problem with this whole thing was it was a stampede that worked its way into a suburban area			0
goodbye @entity24 : and as some folks who live in that area might be saying , " oh well , there goes the neighborhood ! " nah , we 're just horsin ' around			0
we 're sure the new residents are totally stable			0
you guys have a great weekend			0
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity20 .			1
