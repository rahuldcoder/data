the @entity1 candidate for @entity2 in @entity3 brought in a foreign policy and national security heavyweight , a week after his opponent sen. @entity9 's @entity8 attendance record became a lightning rod in the contentious race			1
sen. @entity12 joined state house speaker @entity13 on the campaign trail thursday in an effort to boost the @entity1 nominee 's national security credo in a race where the fight against @entity20 has become a top campaign issue			1
as both candidates criticized president @entity26 's strategy in @entity27 , @entity12 praised @entity13 an " experienced , talented , proven leader , " the @entity23 - based @entity22 reported			0
and @entity12 , who is also a member of the @entity8 , gave weight to attacks against @entity9 for missing more than half of all the committee 's public hearings in the last two years , as well as one classified briefing on @entity20 and other national security threats with the director of national intelligence , which she missed for a fundraiser in @entity39			1
" we hold hearings so that we can be better informed and when she does n't show up , obviously , it indicates that she 's not well - informed " @entity12 said according to the @entity40			0
" these are very , very serious times , and sen. @entity9 was n't there			0
" @entity9 's campaign has pushed back since @entity50 and outside allies slammed @entity9 in ads for missing the crucial briefing , asserting the @entity53 attended 98 % of the committee 's votes			2
@entity9 's camp has also fought back with an ad of its own , knocking @entity13 for his own uninspiring attendance record in the state legislature , where he played hooky several times to fundraise for his campaign			1
@entity13 beat back those accusations on a call with reporters last week saying , " quite honestly , if i had anything approaching the seriousness of the threat of @entity20 , i would have canceled anything i was doing			0
" @entity12 's presence next to @entity13 , this time at an event with a veterans ' group , also served to deflect criticism that the @entity3 @entity1 has offered few specifics for how he would confront the @entity20 threat			2
@entity12 has been one of the most vocal critics of the @entity26 administration 's strategy for confronting @entity20 , particularly the @entity80 's public claim that the @entity81 will not put @entity81 boots on the ground -- and that it can still defeat @entity20 .			0

@entity12 joined @entity13 in slamming @entity9 's @entity8 attendance record .
@entity20 has become a campaign issue after the @entity13 campaign attacked @entity9 's hearing attendance .
