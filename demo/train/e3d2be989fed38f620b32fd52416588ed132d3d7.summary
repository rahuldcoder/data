-- @entity3 is " frustrated " by @entity5 's efforts to block its @entity7 membership over a longstanding identity dispute , the country 's prime minister has said			1
in an interview with @entity0 , @entity3 prime minister @entity9 said that @entity5 is " very successful " in making the @entity12 nation look " guilty " over the use of the word " @entity3 " in its state name			1
" @entity5 is not ready to make a compromise ... so we can not solve the issue , " he said			0
@entity9 said the @entity5 government is " rejecting " @entity3 's advances to open talks and revealed that he tried to contact @entity5 prime minister @entity19 , but his offers were rejected			1
@entity9 added : " the international law is on our side and i believe that if @entity5 decides to respect international law , we can start the negotiations with the @entity7 and we can join @entity28 immediately			1
" the name dispute between the two countries has rumbled on since @entity3 gained independence from @entity32 in 1991 leading to a @entity34 accord signed by both parties four years later			1
the disagreement centers around the use of the name @entity3 as well as symbols and figures used by the @entity3 : these are traditionally considered part of @entity5 culture from the period when the region was part of ancient @entity5			1
the most prominent of these figures is @entity48 , @entity5 king of @entity49 , who went on to forge one of the largest empires of the ancient world			0
in 2011 , the @entity3 government unveiled a 39 ft statue of the legendary leader in the central square of the nation 's capital , @entity59			2
the @entity60 in the @entity61 ruled in 2011 that @entity5 was wrong to block @entity3 's bid to join @entity28 in 2008			1
the @entity60 said : " @entity5 , by objecting to the admission of the @entity3 [ @entity3 ] to @entity28 , has breached its obligation " to a 1995 @entity65 not to block @entity3 applications made under its current name			1
in response to @entity9 's claims , @entity68 , spokesman for the @entity5 @entity69 , told @entity0 that a number of @entity19 ' predecessors had met with the @entity3 prime minister , but that they were simply " photo opportunities and a @entity76 § ade			1
" @entity68 said : " a whole generation in @entity3 is being poisoned with bitter feelings against @entity5 , which is branded as the culprit for all evils their country is being faced with			1
" he added : " if @entity59 had shown equal degree of commitment , the name issue would have been settled			0
" when asked whether the government would consider removing " @entity3 " from its name , @entity9 said : " there are many parts of this problem ... if there is a dialogue , i believe we can find a solution			0
" but @entity94 , former @entity95 permanent representative to @entity28 , told @entity0 that while modifying the name is possible , taking " @entity3 " out of the name completely is not under discussion			2
@entity94 said : " i think that the @entity3 have moved quite far and i think that they are prepared to make an agreement on a modified name for the country for the purposes of being recognized in international organizations			2
" however , he added : " that does n't go as far as the @entity5 have insisted			0
they wanted to change everything including for the @entity3 to change their constitution			0
that 's just pie in the sky , that 's never going to happen			0
" @entity3 submitted its application to join the @entity7 in 2004 but is yet to open negotiations with legislators over @entity7 status			1
@entity7 membership would give @entity3 -- a country of just 2.1 million people according to @entity118 -- access to the world 's largest trading bloc and representation at the @entity124 institutions in @entity125			2
@entity3 already has free trade agreements with a number of @entity129 countries including @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 in addition to states within @entity124 's economic and political union			2
according to an assessment by the @entity138 , @entity3 " sufficiently " meets the political criteria to open negotiations			1
@entity141 , spokesman for @entity143 commissioner @entity142 , told @entity0 that the @entity125 - based legislature has recommended for five years in a row to open accession negotiations with @entity3			2
he added : " together we are stronger , and especially in the @entity148 , we contribute to the reconciliation among nations and to guaranteeing peace and reinforcing stability in a region marked by conflicts in a not so distant past			0
" @entity9 said that membership for all countries in the @entity148 will provide " long term stability " to the region and ultimately attract more foreign investment			0
" personal income tax is 10 % , profit tax is 10 %			0
the other taxes are also very low , so as a package we are offering the best tax package to the companies that are coming			0
" with low inflation and growth forecast at 2.8 % this year , @entity3 could represent a significant opportunity for investors looking to tap southeast @entity124			0
asked whether @entity3 would have to raise taxes if they gained entry into the @entity7 , @entity9 said : " we will try not to go up but when the time comes we will see			2
