-- a @entity2 @entity1 is expected to make a full recovery after a freak accident that left a large barbecue fork lodged in his head for days , according to the animal hospital where he was treated			1
during a family gathering two weeks ago , 12 - week - old @entity10 was waiting to be fed as his owner used the fork to shoo another dog away from @entity10 's food , @entity16 , vice president of @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity2 , wrote in an article on the hospital 's web site			1
as owner @entity23 of @entity24 , @entity2 , waved the fork , the handle broke off and the fork end was flung through the air , embedding itself several inches into @entity10 's head			1
@entity10 immediately ran into the woods , @entity16 wrote			1
for two days , his owner 's family searched for him despite bad weather and finally came to the conclusion that he had either died of his injury or been killed by wildlife			2
@entity23 's brother , @entity38 , was visiting his sister and sitting on the porch when @entity10 came up the driveway with the fork still sticking out of his head , @entity16 wrote			1

" veterinarian @entity53 knew @entity10 's treatment might be expensive and spoke with @entity38 about options , @entity16 wrote			2
@entity53 offered to treat @entity10 at the hospital 's expense if @entity38 allowed the hospital to call media outlets about the @entity1 's story			1
however , staffers wanted to make sure @entity10 would live through the night first before calling anyone , @entity16 said			0
it only took the veterinarian about 30 seconds to remove the fork from @entity10 's head , @entity45 said			1
