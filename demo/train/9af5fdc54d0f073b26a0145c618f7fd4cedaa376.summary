-- come december 18 , we 'll have to say goodbye to our favorite blowhard political character , " @entity4			1
" that 's the day the real @entity4 will retire " @entity4 " the character as he signs off from his @entity8 show , " @entity7 , " in preparation to take over for @entity10 in 2015			1
for all of us @entity4 fans , it feels like losing an old friend who we 've grown to know , laugh with ( and at ) over the past nine years			1
you see , when @entity4 takes over @entity10 's show next year , he will no longer be " @entity4 , " but rather the real @entity4			1
but here 's the thing : what happens if we do n't find the real @entity4 as entertaining and engaging as the fictional " @entity4 " ? after all , " @entity4 " is a bigger - than - life character and the reason his humor works so well is because it 's delivered in a comedic voice			1
here are just a few examples : " why would we go to war on women ? they do n't have any oil			0
" " contraception leads to more babies being born out of wedlock , the exact same way that fire extinguishers cause fires			0
" " if we do n't cut expensive things like @entity37 , child nutrition programs , and teachers , what sort of future are we leaving for our children ? " " join me in standing up against any actual knowledge about guns			0
let the @entity46 know they can take away our ignorance when the pry it from our cold , dead minds			0
" these jokes are n't nearly as funny -- if funny at all -- if not told via " @entity4 , " complete with his pompousness , arching eyebrow and screaming eagle			1
therein lies @entity4 's challenge			1
now , before my fellow @entity4 fans turn on me , i 'm not suggesting @entity4 is n't capable of being funny outside of " @entity4			1
" he 's truly an immensely talented performer who trained at the famed @entity56 in @entity57 and has been making us laugh for years			0
but why drop " @entity4 " when it 's that very character that got @entity4 the " @entity10 " gig in the first place ? please do n't tell me it 's in response to the views of people like @entity66 -- an unintentional " @entity4 " -- who remarked when @entity4 was announced as @entity10 's replacement : " @entity69 has just declared war on the heartland of @entity72			1
no longer is comedy going to be a covert assault on traditional @entity72 values , conservatism			0
now it 's just wide out in the open			0
" why would anyone care what @entity66 says ? ( seriously , why ? ! ) but i bet that @entity66 's views resonated with some @entity69 executives who actually were concerned that " @entity4 " could alienate some more conservative viewers			1
( as if conservatives ca n't laugh at themselves ... ) and that 's a real concern for @entity69 since @entity10 's show in 2013 reportedly garnered $ 179 million in ad revenue for the network			1
no one at @entity69 wants that figure to go down			0
but those same tv executives should keep in mind that in the sweeps ratings period in may , " @entity7 " was almost tied with the number of viewers " @entity10 " attracted in the coveted 18 - 49 age demographic			1
and @entity4 's reach will be even greater when he moves to network tv and is no longer just on @entity8 , which reaches only 85 % of the country			1
to be candid , i have another concern about @entity4 dumping " @entity4			2
" i was watching some clips of @entity4 being himself			2
he comes across as thoughtful , well - spoken and analytical			0
those are admirable qualities in the real world , but not so much for a tv personality who will have to carry a weekly late night comedy show			0
we are n't talking " @entity108 , " we are talking a late - night comedy show where the competition for viewers is fierce			0
for example , i watched an interview of @entity4 by the late @entity114 on " @entity115 " in 2007			2
@entity4 was low energy and pleasant			2
but i kept waiting for " @entity4 " to emerge			2
and in 2013 @entity4 appeared on @entity118 's " @entity117 , " where his knowledge of the @entity121 administration was impressive			1
but he was low key , wonky , and , frankly ( dare i say ? ) almost boring			0
( and i love politics			0
) i 'm not in any way suggesting that @entity4 needs to be a nonstop joke machine			2
what i 'm saying is that " @entity4 " the character has set the bar high for @entity4 the person			2
the success of " @entity4 " is as much about the jokes that come out of his mouth as it 's about his character 's point of view , energy , mannerism , etc. and we colbert fans , along with the far less friendly tv critics , will no doubt compare " @entity4 " to @entity4 when he takes the reins at his @entity69 show			1
expect to see reviews that say along the lines of , " we miss ' @entity4 ' " or worse , " @entity4 is not as funny as ' @entity4			2
' " but there 's one bright spot for " @entity4 " fans that @entity4 told @entity114			1
he mentioned being taught years ago at @entity56 to " wear a character as light as a cap , " so that you can easily move in and out of it			0
that means " @entity4 " will likely never be too far away from @entity4			0
hopefully , that will mean that we 'll see glimmers of our old friend from time to time .			0

on december 18 , we 'll have to say goodbye to the political character , " @entity4 "
@entity163 : for all of us @entity4 fans , it feels like losing an old friend
when @entity4 takes over @entity10 's show , will he be as funny as his fictional persona ?
