@entity0 recently caught up with him to talk about his new novel			0
@entity1 , a man of letters but few words , gave us some insight into his work			1
the following is an edited transcript : @entity0 : " @entity17 is dying " is not your typical crime novel , how would you describe it ? @entity1 : as a novel about three isolated people living in a huge makeshift city in the middle of forbidding desert , three people who in the course of the novel find community of a sort			1
@entity0 : tell me more about your three main characters , @entity48 , @entity51 & @entity53			2
@entity1 : @entity48 is a hired killer dying of an unspecified terminal disease			1
he goes to fulfill his final contract but is beaten to the punch , and sees his mark taken down by someone else			0
with no knowledge at all of @entity48 , @entity51 is the detective investigating that attack			0
he is cut off from others and from his own emotions , with only his job to hold him in place ; his wife is dying of cancer			2
@entity53 is a teenager abandoned by both parents and living by his wits , buying and selling on @entity101 to get by , expecting any day to get caught and taken away			0
then suddenly , in the third chapter , @entity53 is having the killer 's , @entity48 's , dreams			2
@entity0 : @entity46 really comes alive in your book , what is it about the city that interests you as a writer ? @entity1 : it 's the nation 's fifth largest city , a triumph of will and engineering over common sense , surrounded by miles of what looks at first to be almost nothing			1
sprawling , various , indefinable , ungraspable			0
if ever there was a melting pot , this is one			0
kinda south , kinda west , kinda old , kinda ageless , kinda @entity122 , kinda @entity123 ...			0
@entity0 : you 're something of a renaissance man , beyond your crime novels , you 're also a poet , a translator , a biographer , a musician and a teacher			0
how do these various disciplines influence your work overall ? @entity1 : take any one of those away , the work would be quite different			1
i would be quite different			0
@entity0 : did you always want to be a writer ? @entity1 : i think i knew pretty early that that 's where i was headed			1
like the automobile wreck in @entity144 : " saw it start to , saw it had to , saw it happen			0
" or as someone once described noir fiction : " force of circumstances driving protagonists to the commission of dreadful acts			2
" @entity0 : one of your most popular novels , " drive , " is out now as a @entity26 movie			2
how involved were you in the adaptation and what do you think of the movie ? @entity1 : i had no involvement beyond providing the novel -- the buzzer in the chair that got everyone up and moving			2
it 's an astonishingly fine movie , one that will be talked about and referenced , i suspect , for many years			0
@entity168 's direction , @entity25 's acting , @entity171 ' bad guy - all tremendous			0
read more about the movie and see a trailer for " @entity174			0
" @entity0 : what have you read recently that really made an impression on you ? @entity1 : mostly rereads : a collection of @entity181 's stories , " @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184			1
" @entity186 's " the @entity185			0
