@entity0 , @entity1 -- the forest was in charge			1
i knew it the moment i gazed at its dense green overcoat , searching for cracks of daylight in its chaotic folds			1
inspiring in the morning kiss of gentle light rays ; sulky under a black afternoon cloud ; serene in the falling dusk , as the haze of twilight accentuated its mystery			1
i was in @entity1 's @entity0 , part of a guided trek to see some of its 300 endangered mountain gorillas			1
the moment i stepped in i surrendered			1
it was humid and dark and the dense , feisty foliage that enveloped me was dismissive at times , taunting at others			1
all the trekkers were handed a tall narrow stick to help navigate through the slippery slopes			1
the moist leaves scattered on the soil demanded balance , stinging nettles and hiding holes urged utmost caution , centuries - old greenery wrapped its arms around me , challenging me to hack through the twisted vines and untested trails			1
it tripped me over again , slipping , sliding			2
i grit my teeth knowing the forest was forcing me to want the prize it hid in its shape - shifting bosom			2
the target : a group of eight gorillas , one silverback and his eight babes			1
three sweltering hours that drew blood and inflicted bruises , yet i pushed on , realizing the forest would not give me something for nothing			2
one @entity60 obstacle course after the other , crisp slices of machetes hacked the twines , daring the forest to dissuade us			2
three hours of grueling walking scattered with hard landings			2
no matter how contorted i became , the forest kept a piece of itself handy to cling on to , a mini consolation prize hinting that it was , after all , on my side			2
i could almost hear its heaving chuckles as i disentangled myself from ropes of thorns			2
" keep going , " the rangers called out as i felt the sweat dribble down my back			0
no matter how much i wanted out , i had to push on , because there was no way out without rangers slicing pathways through the wild bush			0
i received a painful sting from a large black creature with loud wings ; i ignored it and walked on with my muddy water - logged shoes , and the threat of rain			0
" we 're here , " the lead ranger whispered , stopping dead still and turning up the drama , punctuated by a light breeze that picked up along with a list of rules of gorilla engagement , which we absorbed			0
" stay seven meters away			0
" " if you want to cough or sneeze , turn away , you could infect them with your germs			0
" " one hour only			0
" it was a rare 60 minutes , the shortest , the most fascinating			0
i lifted my eyes and there she was , a giant gorilla clinging onto a tree trunk , sucking the bark out of an apparently delicious eucalyptus tree , getting tipsy ; sitting in shade , munching shoots and leaves , and then nonchalantly striding by			1
i observed their powerful arms , elegant posture , and the occasional eye contact made me feel connected			1
they are intimidating and gentle , protective and patient , flirtatious and fearsome , at the same time			0
protected by a hardcore ring of black backs , a mother nursed a three - week - old gorilla			0
it was a rare and moving sight			0
she hid her offspring under her belly , " protection from vultures , " we were told			0
immersed in their world , listening to their language , the beat of their group , the simple raw reality of their lives and tribe , i forgot my complex world			0
