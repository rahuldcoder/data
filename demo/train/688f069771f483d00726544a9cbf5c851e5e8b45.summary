a subsequent probe that looked into the shady m&a transactions , including whether there was @entity6 mob involvement , have pummeled shares of the camera and medical equipment maker			2
the share value has dropped more than 80 % in the past six weeks			0
the company faces the threat of de-listing from the @entity44 for inaccurate financial statements			0
@entity26 was back in @entity46 on thursday , where he met with @entity6 prosecutors			1

" @entity26 claims he was fired because he asked about the $ 1.4 billion in questionable transaction fees			1
