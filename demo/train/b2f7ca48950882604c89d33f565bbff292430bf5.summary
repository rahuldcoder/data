@entity0 -- 't is indeed the season to be jolly for @entity3 , who are experiencing their lowest levels of holiday stress in years , according to a new @entity1 / @entity7 nationwide poll			1
the poll suggests they 've already decked their halls with boughs of holly , as only 30 % of the public said they 're feeling a great deal or fair amount of stress from all the things they need to do to get ready for @entity20			2
related : read the entire @entity1 / @entity7 poll that 's a steep drop from 2005 , when a vast majority of @entity3 must 've left the tree - trimming to the last minute , as 86 % said they felt a great deal or fair amount of stress that year			1
in 1989 , 76 % felt the same , perhaps because they waited too long to buy the new @entity29 , the hot toy released that year			0
@entity3 may be feeling less stress this year in part because they 're not dealing with the often messy hassle of putting up a natural tree , and the pressure to make sure far - flung extended family members get their @entity20 cards in time			1
the survey found a slight majority of @entity3 -- 51 % -- plan to have an artificial christmas tree this year , up from just 39 % in 1996			0
and only 58 % of @entity3 planned to send holiday cards this year , down from 74 % in 2006			1
but that does n't mean @entity3 are losing their holiday spirit : 95 % say they celebrate @entity20			2
but the country is split on whether observers view it more as a family holiday -- 47 % -- or as a religious holiday , 46 %			0
that 's a shift from 1992 , when a slight majority of @entity3 said @entity20 was more of a religious celebration			0
for most @entity3 , the holiday moment to look forward to is @entity20 -- that 's when 58 % of the nation opens their presents			2
a lucky 20 % of the nation opens them both on @entity57 and @entity20			0
the poll also found @entity3 are n't as concerned as they used to be about a terrorist attack will hitting over the holidays			1
see also : @entity62 threatens to steal @entity20 a lot now , just 39 % say a terrorist attack is very or somewhat likely , down from more than half in 2010			1
the survey was conducted through live interviews of 1,011 adults nationwide via landlines and cell phones and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points ; no attempt was made to reach @entity76 about his stress levels , which presumably peak this time of year .			0
