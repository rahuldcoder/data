@entity0 , @entity1 -- after a long apprenticeship , it 's been an astonishingly fast rise for @entity7 singer @entity6			1
@entity6 is up for five @entity8 next month , including best new artist			1
before she was in her teens , @entity6 sang on " @entity11 at the @entity12			1
" at 13 , she met @entity13			2
soon she was performing regularly at the jam sessions called @entity15 in her hometown of @entity17 , @entity18			2
she went to that city 's performing arts high school and was signed to a contract by @entity23 , where she was paired with producers such as @entity25 and @entity26			2
it did n't work out -- then			0
but soon , @entity6 signed with @entity29 ' @entity28 , and suddenly she was everywhere			1
her debut single , " @entity30 , " hit no. 1 on @entity34 's @entity33 chart , and her album " @entity36 " hit the @entity37 on @entity34 's album chart			1
now she 's up for five @entity8 on february 8 , including best r&b performance ( for " @entity40 " ) and best new artist			1
@entity2 's @entity41 talked with @entity6 about her inspirations , who she 's bringing to the @entity8 and the mysterious person behind " @entity40			1
" the following is an edited version of that interview			0
@entity2 : how would you describe your sound ? @entity6 : i ca n't really describe it ; that 's the whole thing			1
once you hear the cd , you 'll hear that one sound does n't sound like the next			0
you know , i 've been influenced by so many different styles and different genres of music that i felt like that should be represented on my first album , so when you get it , you get a taste of gospel , jazz , r&b , hip - hop , reggae , pop ... everything is on there , there 's something for everybody to enjoy			2
i did n't want to exclude anybody from the album			0
@entity2 : let me ask you this : when you saw or heard the other nominees in the best new artist category who happen to be a little bit more well - known , was it intimidating ? i mean , you got the @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 ... @entity6 : yeah , the @entity81 , specifically			1
i did n't even know they were new artists because they are so huge , so , you know , so after , when my name was called after theirs , i thought , " wow , they 're new artists , too ? " i got a little scared , i tell you that			0
but i 'm just so honored to be mentioned to be in the same categories with such wonderful artists , so i 'm looking forward to february and the @entity8 and just being in that atmosphere			0
@entity2 : i was looking at your background , and i did n't know that you 're a protegee of @entity93			1
i was thinking to myself , you would think that you would do rap , but you 're this big voice , this soulful voice			0
you might not equate that with @entity93			1
@entity6 : yeah , and a lot of people do n't know that @entity93 ... grew up in the church , and she 's really into vocalists			1
when i met her , was i was about 13 or 14 , [ and ] she was ecstatic about me			0
when nobody else was there to support me , @entity93 was there , so she 's a good friend of mine , and i 'm happy to have her by my side			1
she 's definitely taught me a lot of things			2
@entity2 : so everybody wants to know , the guy behind " @entity40 " -- is there one ? @entity6 : we wo n't talk about that on camera -- that 's an off - camera conversation -- but it 's definitely a song that relates to a lot of women especially			1
you know , even if they really have n't busted windows out of anybody 's car , they have wanted to			2
a lot of women have been through that , so i 'm glad that my music is touching those people @entity2 : " @entity30 " is rising as well			1
what 's the thought process behind that one ? @entity6 : " @entity30 " ... a lot of men actually pointed out to me that women do n't come out and admit that they made mistakes and say that they actually need the male , so i think that was kind of cool			1
i have n't thought of it like that when i was writing it			0
so , you know , it 's a song for the fellas , saying that we appreciate them and we need you as much as you need us			2
but on the flip side , i do a song like " @entity40 , " so on the album you have a lot of different perceptions and everything			1
@entity2 : how old are you ? you look like you 're 10			0
@entity6 : i 'm 21 years old			1
@entity2 : success that early , that 's sometimes tough for people			2
@entity6 : well , i 've been in this industry for a very long time			1
i started out when i was 12 ; i got signed when i was 16 , so it was n't an overnight success story at all			0
i put a lot of hard work into it , and this is just a byproduct of all of that			0
@entity2 : it 's great that you write your own music too , because a lot of people do n't do that			2
you have a lot more creative control			0
@entity6 : most definitely , and i 've dealt with not having that control when i was younger and i was signed			1
i was n't writing at all , and so i 've been through all of that			0
so now to be in a position where i write my music , and i have that control -- it feels so much better			0
@entity2 : all right , the big question : @entity8 night			0
what are you wearing ? who are you bringing ? what are you going to be doing ? @entity6 : i 'm bringing my mother			1
she 's been my rock and my support ever since i was a baby			2
she was my first huge fan , that what she is			0
i do n't know what i 'm wearing			0
i 'm trying not to think about that			0
hopefully i can get on stage and i can show everybody who i am and what i 'm about			0
but i have n't thought about the dress or the shoes or the hair or anything about that			0
@entity2 : you 're just trying to enjoy the moment			0
@entity6 : enjoy , yes .			2
