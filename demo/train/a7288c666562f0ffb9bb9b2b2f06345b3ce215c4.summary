@entity0 -- the @entity2 on tuesday rejected an amendment to tighten restrictions on federal funding for abortion in the sweeping health care bill it is debating			1
on a 54 - 45 vote , the chamber agreed to table the amendment , which effectively killed it from further consideration			1
rejection of the amendment means the @entity2 health bill , if approved with the current abortion language , would differ from more restrictive language in the @entity21 version of the bill passed last month			1
the amendment filed monday by sens. @entity24 , @entity25 , and @entity26 , @entity27 , mirrored language in the @entity21 bill that prevents any health plan receiving federal subsidies from offering coverage for abortion			1
anti-abortion legislators said the amendment would maintain the current level of restriction by preventing any federal funding for abortion except in the case of rape , incest or a threat to the life of the mother			1
@entity26 argued tuesday that the @entity2 proposal as originally written provides a loophole for the use of federal money to subsidize health insurance that would cover abortion			2
" taxpayers should not be called upon to pay for abortion , " @entity26 said			0
other @entity55 senators said the strong opposition by millions of @entity57 to federal funding for abortion should be respected by passing the amendment to tighten restrictions			1
@entity24 had warned that without the amendment , he could vote against ending debate on the bill			2
senate majority leader @entity65 , @entity66 , needs 60 votes to close debate on the bill and bring it to a vote , and 51 votes for final passage			1
in the @entity2 , the @entity72 caucus has 60 members			0
if @entity24 or any other democrats break with the caucus , @entity65 will need some @entity55 support to move forward			2
@entity2 @entity55 unanimously oppose the bill			0
opponents of the tougher language argued that the amendment would expand the current level of restriction because women receiving coverage under a federally subsidized health care plan would be barred from purchasing abortion coverage with their own money			0
" why are women being singled out here ? it 's so unfair , " said sen. @entity87 , @entity88 , adding there is no medical procedure for men that can not be purchased with private funds			0
sen. @entity93 , @entity94 , said the real goal of the amendment is to deny women covered by government - funded health care the right to get an abortion			0
" let 's keep federal policy in place that does not allow federal funding for abortion but respects the women of this country , " @entity93 said			2
@entity110 's two @entity55 senators -- @entity112 and @entity113 -- both joined @entity72 in voting to table the amendment , while seven @entity72 voted with the chamber 's other 38 republicans against killing the proposal			0
the @entity21 adopted its restrictive language as part of a last - minute concession to anti-abortion legislators who threatened to defeat the health care bill without a vote on the provision			1
@entity65 , @entity66 , said earlier tuesday he would continue to work with @entity24 on the issue if the @entity129 lawmaker 's amendment failed			1
" i 'm happy to work with him , " @entity65 said			0
" if , in fact , he does n't succeed here , we 'll try something else			0
" if the @entity2 eventually passes a bill that gets merged with the @entity21 version , the abortion language will be a crucial issue			1
an anti-abortion bloc in the @entity21 threatens to reject a bill without the tougher language adopted by the chamber , while a liberal - progressive @entity21 bloc has said it wo n't accept a bill with the more restrictive provision			1
also on tuesday , liberal and moderate @entity72 reached a " broad agreement " on the public option portion of the @entity2 health care bill , @entity65 said			2
without revealing any details , @entity65 said the negotiating senators had reached an agreement that " moves this bill way down the road			0
" two @entity72 sources said the deal includes proposals to replace the public option by creating a not - for - profit private insurance option overseen by the federal @entity160 , much like the current health plan for federal workers , and another allowing people 55 and older to buy into @entity165 coverage that currently is available to those 65 and older			0
but sen. @entity167 of @entity168 , one of 10 @entity72 senators working on the deal , said in a statement released after @entity65 's announcement that he would not " support proposals that would replace the public option in the bill with a purely private approach			2
" @entity1 's @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180 contributed to this report .			0

@entity183 would have tightened restrictions on federal funding
@entity2 tabled the amendment on a 54 - 45 vote
@entity21 bill contains more restrictive language
senate majority leader @entity65 said he 'll continue to work with sen. @entity24
