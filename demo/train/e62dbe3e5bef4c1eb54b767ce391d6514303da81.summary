-- @entity1 grew up in the @entity3 area			0
aged 33 , he died more than 6,000 miles to the east of his birthplace , fighting in @entity6 for @entity7 , the group that calls itself the " @entity8			1
" @entity7 is a group that even @entity9 has rejected , in part , for its reprehensible tactics , which run to public crucifixions			2
@entity1 's transformation to a militant jihadist left his family " devastated , " his uncle , @entity13 , told @entity0			0
@entity1 is the first @entity17 known to have been killed while fighting for @entity7			1
but he is not the only @entity17 drawn to the group or to @entity9 's affiliate in @entity6 , the @entity20			1
in may 2014 , @entity21 , a 22 - year - old @entity17 citizen from @entity23 , conducted a suicide bombing on behalf of @entity25			1
@entity21 had reportedly re-entered the @entity17 after he received training from the group in @entity6 and before returning to the conflict			1
@entity21 is the first @entity17 suicide bomber known to have died in @entity6			2
some 100 other @entity17 are believed to have either fought in @entity6 since 2011 or been arrested before they could get there			1
according to a count by the @entity32 , eight of these individuals have been indicted for traveling , attempting to travel , or facilitating the travel of others to fight with @entity7 or the @entity20			2
some of these cases involved those who tried to join @entity7 or @entity25 , but were arrested before they could leave the @entity40 : @entity41 , an 18 - year - old @entity17 citizen from @entity42 , @entity43 , was arrested and charged with attempting to provide material support to @entity25			1
on april 19 , 2013 , he was caught in a sting operation and said that he had no combat skills to speak of : " concerning my fighting skills , to be honest , i do not have any			0
" @entity41 pleaded not guilty and awaits trial			0
@entity49 , a @entity50 man , was arrested in november 2013 at @entity51 in @entity50 while allegedly trying to fly to @entity52 in order to join @entity25			0
@entity55 , a 20 - year - old from @entity57 , was arrested in march 2014 while allegedly traveling to join @entity7			0
@entity55 pleaded not guilty and awaits trial			0
@entity59 , a 19 - year - old @entity60 woman , was arrested in april 2014 and charged with attempting to provide material support to @entity7			2
@entity63 , a 20 - year - old @entity64 man , was arrested at @entity65 while allegedly attempting to travel to join @entity7			0
@entity63 was charged with lying about needing a passport replacement to conceal that the real reason he needed to replace his passport was that his mother had hidden his original passport to prevent his travel			0
in december , @entity74 , an @entity17 citizen from southern @entity57 , pleaded guilty to a charge of attempting to provide material support to @entity9			0
between december 2012 and april 2013 , @entity74 had traveled to @entity6 , where , he stated , he fought alongside @entity25			1
on his return , @entity74 discussed with an informant his intent to participate further in jihad			0
in august 2013 , @entity81 , a naturalized @entity17 citizen living in @entity82 , was charged with attempting to provide material support to @entity25 in @entity6 by facilitating the recruitment of experienced fighters from @entity9 's @entity87 affiliate to travel to @entity6			1
@entity88 , a 23 - year - old @entity89 man , pleaded guilty to attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization by traveling to @entity6 to fight with @entity7			1
because of the murky nature of the @entity6 conflict , it is sometimes a challenge to identify the groups that @entity17 traveling to @entity6 are involved with			1
two cases -- those of @entity99 and @entity100 -- illustrate this difficulty			0
@entity102 , a @entity104 woman , was killed in @entity6 in 2013 , reportedly during a military clash			2
however , details on whether she was fighting in @entity6 and , if so , which group she fought for remain under investigation			2
@entity100 was indicted upon his return to the @entity17 in 2013 for fighting with @entity25 , but it was later discovered that the @entity112 had mistranslated the name of the group he fought with and he had actually fought with a group that was not aligned with @entity9			1
so far , no @entity17 citizen involved in fighting or supporting @entity25 or @entity7 has been charged with plotting to conduct an attack inside the @entity17			1
further , @entity7 ' predecessor , @entity9 in @entity121 , never tried to conduct an attack on the @entity17 homeland , although it did bomb three @entity17 hotels in @entity126 in 2005			1
and it 's also worth noting that in none of the successful terrorist attacks in the @entity17 since 9/11 -- such as the @entity131 bombings last year or maj. @entity133 's massacre at @entity134 , @entity89 , in 2009 -- did any of the convicted or alleged perpetrators receive training overseas			0
returning foreign fighters from the @entity6 conflict pose a far greater threat to @entity140 , which has contributed a much larger number of foreign fighters to the conflict than the @entity17 , including an estimated 700 from @entity144 , 450 from the @entity145 and 270 from @entity146			1
unlike in the @entity17 , @entity140 countries have reported specific terrorist plots tied to returning @entity6 fighters			1
@entity150 , a suspect in the may 24 shootings at a @entity153 museum in @entity154 , @entity155 , that killed four people , spent about a year with jihadist fighters in @entity6 , according to the @entity159 prosecutor in the case			2
but @entity150 's case is the only instance of lethal violence by a returning @entity6 fighter in the @entity165			0
what can be done ? @entity168 governments are keenly aware of the problem of @entity6 veterans coming home both radicalized and trained			0
the problem is that in some @entity140 countries with hundreds of returnees , it is just not possible to monitor all of them			0
that was vividly illustrated by the case of @entity150			0
information - sharing between @entity168 governments about the identities of those who have traveled to @entity6 and have received militant training is the key to preventing more incidents such as the one at the @entity185 in @entity154 .			2
