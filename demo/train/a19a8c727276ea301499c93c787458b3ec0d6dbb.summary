@entity0 , @entity1 -- attorneys representing @entity4 and the @entity5 faced off monday in an appeals court hearing over the state 's controversial new immigration law			1
@entity4 gov. @entity9 has asked the 9th @entity10 to overturn a federal judge 's july ruling , which blocked the most contested parts of the law the day before it was scheduled to go into effect			1
in response to the @entity5 's suit over the law , @entity18 district judge @entity17 's july ruling temporarily blocked such controversial provisions as the requirement that police officers check a person 's immigration status while enforcing other laws			1
critics have argued that the law , known as @entity30 , would lead to racial profiling			1
@entity9 and other @entity4 officials have said the law is necessary to make up for federal government failures in enforcing immigration laws			1
an attorney for the @entity5 told the court that the @entity4 law is " an extraordinary state statute that exacts penalties on top of federal ones enacted by @entity43			1
" " if every state did this , we would have a patchwork of laws " on immigration , @entity5 lawyer @entity44 said			1
but @entity51 , the attorney for @entity4 , told the three - judge panel that the law 's provisions " are consistent with congressional objectives			1
" " it 's objectives that count rather than this administration 's priority , " @entity51 said , referring to the @entity57 @entity56			0
" @entity4 has 15,000 well - trained and capable officers on the ground who can help the fix the system			1
" @entity51 asked the court to lift the injunction so that @entity4 can " get on with taking care of the health , safety and welfare of citizens			2
" the judges adjourned after hearing the arguments			0
each side had 30 minutes to present arguments before the panel of three judges at monday 's hour - long hearing , which started at 9 a.m. @entity9 said that the case is about what states " can do about a failed federal immigration system that even president @entity57 acknowledges is broken			1
" " @entity4 is on the front line in a fight against crime that is spilling over the international border , " @entity9 said in a written statement			2
" as noted in the court record , the federal government has essentially had to cede a vast territory inside the state of @entity4 to the drug runners and human smugglers			2
" activists on both sides have weighed in on the case			0
@entity98 lawmakers , @entity100 sheriff @entity99 and other state governments are among those filing briefs with the appeals court supporting @entity4 's argument			2
the @entity106 government , the @entity105 , the @entity105 and the city of @entity108 , @entity4 , are among those filing briefs supporting the @entity5 's side			2
some parts of the @entity4 law took effect in july , including a ban on " sanctuary cities " : municipalities with laws or policies that render them relatively safe for undocumented immigrants			1
@entity120 's july ruling also allowed a provision in the law that makes it illegal to hire day laborers if doing so impedes traffic			0
in addition , the ruling allowed parts of the law dealing with sanctions for employers who hire illegal immigrants			0
but the ruling blocked a provision requiring alien registration papers			0
the stay also suspended a provision making it a crime " for an unauthorized alien to solicit , apply for , or perform work " and another provision " authorizing the warrantless arrest of a person " when there 's a reason to believe that person might be subject to deportation			0
even after monday 's hearing , analysts say , legal wrangling over @entity4 's law is likely to continue			2
as other states pass similar laws , the issue is " very much destined for the @entity157 , " @entity2 senior legal analyst @entity156 said in july			0
state sen. @entity158 , who sponsored the law , has said he foresaw a protracted legal battle from the beginning			0
" i wrote this bill for that fistfight , prepared for that fistfight , " he said			0
" we 'll prevail in the fistfight , because it 's states ' rights			0
" @entity2 's @entity169 contributed to this report .			0
