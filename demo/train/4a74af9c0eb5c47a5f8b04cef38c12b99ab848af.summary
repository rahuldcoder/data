-- voices around the @entity2 and @entity3 gave mixed grades to @entity6 's address on the region thursday , with @entity9 rebels calling it " good enough " and a @entity12 official calling it a " half - full glass			1
" in @entity19 , the heart of the @entity9 revolt against longtime strongman @entity18 , a rebel leader pronounced @entity6 's speech in support of democratic movements across the region " good enough			1
" " overall , the speech was positive for @entity9 , " said @entity24 , a spokesman for the @entity25			1
rebel leaders were pleased to hear @entity6 call their provisional government " legitimate and credible , " remarks that raised hopes of eventual @entity32 recognition as the country 's rightful government -- and accompanying aid			1
" hopefully , they will recognize our aspirations , " @entity24 said			0
" they will recognize us fully , and we can bring this chapter to an end			0
" in his @entity42 speech , @entity6 pledged @entity32 support for reform efforts across the @entity2 and @entity3 , warning leaders facing popular upheavals that " strategies of oppression and strategies of diversion will not work anymore			1
" it comes amid the @entity52 , popular revolts that have driven two regional autocrats from power and fueled calls for reform or open revolts in several other countries			1
he also pledged additional economic aid for longtime @entity32 ally @entity62 and said the @entity32 and @entity64 would push for expanded trade with the region			1
that was good news for @entity69 , who watched @entity6 's address from a @entity72 coffeehouse			1
@entity69 said tourism -- one of the pillars of @entity62 's economy -- has dried up since the pro-democracy protests that drove @entity78 from power after three decades			1
" we are feeling it 's getting worse , not better , " @entity69 told @entity0			0
@entity69 , an engineer from @entity62 's @entity82 minority , said @entity62 's revolution " needs time			2
it needs a steady push , but time			1
" on the eve of a meeting with @entity90 prime minister @entity89 , the @entity32 leader restated the @entity32 desire for a comprehensive settlement of the decades - old @entity90 - @entity12 conflict			2
his call for an agreement based on @entity90 's pre- 1967 borders drew criticism from @entity89 , who called those frontiers " indefensible , " but @entity6 also poured cold water on @entity12 efforts to seek a unilateral declaration of statehood at the @entity103			1
@entity104 , a senior adviser to @entity12 leader @entity105 , called the speech a " half - full glass			0
" he told @entity0 that @entity105 would review the speech with all @entity12 factions and present @entity6 with some " specific requirements " for translating his rhetoric into " a real peace process			2
" on @entity113 , @entity6 praised the courage of @entity113 protesters who have defied a violent crackdown by president @entity117 and blasted @entity117 's government for choosing " the path of murder " in response to calls for democratic change			1
@entity125 , he said , " now has a choice : he can lead that transition or get out of the way			0
" but on the social media site @entity128 , a supporter of the @entity113 revolt sounded a note of disappointment			0
" we @entity113 started this alone and if ur too afraid to take action , we can handle this alone , " the poster said			0
@entity6 's passing reference to @entity142 , in which he urged embattled president @entity143 to " follow through " on his reported agreement to step down after 32 years in power , drew mixed reviews from anti-government protesters there			1
" we wanted @entity6 to directly call @entity143 to leave office the same way he did with @entity78 , " said @entity149 , a youth leader in the capital @entity151			2
" he did not do that			0
this is wrong , and he is not being honest with the wave of change in the @entity2			0
" another protester , @entity158 , told @entity0 , " we had hoped to hear more			0
" but @entity6 " spoke directly to the @entity142 people , " @entity158 said			2
" that 's something we 're not used to hearing , and it 's an improvement			0
but we realize that president @entity6 can not give as much to the @entity142 people as we can give to ourselves			2
" and @entity163 , a former @entity164 and @entity165 expert on the @entity2 , said @entity6 's address was " a lot more timid than it needed to be			1
" " he spoke a lot more about self - determination and reform than he did about broader concepts like democracy and freedom , " @entity163 told @entity0			0
" he has been pretty cautious about approaching these changes in the @entity2 , " added @entity163 , now an analyst at the @entity174			0
" at least now he has said openly ... that the @entity32 will stand up for its principles in its actions toward the @entity2			2
" @entity0 's @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 and journalist @entity182 contributed to this report .			0
