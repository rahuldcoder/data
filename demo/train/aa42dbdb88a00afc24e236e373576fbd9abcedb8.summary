-- @entity1 got to the point immediately			1
the embattled @entity4 governor , who 's seriously considering a 2016 run for the @entity6 , began his state of the state address on tuesday by pledging to cooperate with multiple investigations into controversies that are threatening to complicate his political future			1
opinion : we need the full truth from @entity1 he did n't specifically mention suggestions that top aides orchestrated traffic gridlock near the country 's busiest bridge last year in an alleged case of political payback , but noted that " mistakes were clearly made			1
" his usual swagger gone , @entity1 continued : " and as a result , we let down the people we are entrusted to serve			1
i know our citizens deserve better			0
i am the governor and i am ultimately responsible for all that happens on my watch - both good and bad			2
" @entity1 : ' mistakes were clearly made ' a @entity29 in a state dominated by @entity31 , @entity1 then moved on			1
he used the rest of the 45 - minute address before state legislators in @entity36 to push his legislative agenda and tout his accomplishments			1
he threaded through his entire speech pitches for his bipartisan efforts , making a plea for those efforts to continue			0
so , how 'd he do ? addressing the controversy early was the right move , experts and analysts said			2
@entity4 @entity47 lawmaker on traffic scandal : ' i do think laws have been broken ' @entity0 chief national correspondent @entity51 : " he did exactly what he needed to do by getting to it first			1
his trademark is being blunt and direct			0
his brand , his trademark , is damaged right now			0
he 's trying to get the tarnish off it			2
this was a first page in the next chapter of @entity1			1
we do n't know where that chapter is going			0
" @entity0 chief political analyst @entity66 : " he got it out of the way early , he said what he needed to say			2
" but @entity66 also said she believes " a line of argument against @entity1 has been established with the public			2
that he is petty , that his administration was vengeful			0
if he wants to reverse that narrative , he does have to get something done in a bipartisan way and he has to get this story over with and it does n't look like it 's going to end any time soon			0
" @entity66 also observed @entity1 's turn - of - phrase			1
" he said that ' mistakes were made , ' not that he made the mistakes			0
" @entity66 added that democrats in @entity4 " now believe they have an opening ( against @entity1 ) and they 're going right through it			2
" @entity0 political analyst @entity86 : " he needed to address the elephant in the room right off the top , and he did			1
he was contrite -- mistakes were made			0
pay careful attention to the word ' appropriate ' -- he 'll cooperate with all ' appropriate ' inquiries			0
i do n't think he 's going to try to turn over private e-mails			0
" @entity0 political analyst @entity96 : " i think it was very smart of him to address it right off the bat			2
he knew all of us were watching those first few minutes			0
then he could go on to talk about filling potholes in @entity4			0
but he captured our attention with those first few sentences			0
" but also in those first few sentences was a phrase that surprised @entity0 political commentator @entity106 : " mistakes were made			1
" " every politician , every pundit knows that that is a phrase , at the very least , from the @entity111 , and it 's basically been mocked as this passive voice and way of pretending to take responsibility for something when you 're not , " @entity106 said			1
