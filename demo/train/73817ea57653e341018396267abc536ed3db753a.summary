-- author @entity1 has returned to the evil street that made him famous in the 1990s , and fans are looking forward to the new ways he 'll terrorize @entity6 teenagers on " @entity7			1
" " @entity11 , " out on september 30 , is the first of six new " @entity7 " books that @entity10 is releasing			1
the premise : when @entity6 senior @entity14 has a birthday party at his parent 's summer house on @entity18 , things go from bad to worse			0
@entity10 , 70 , is the author of more than 300 novels for children and teens , including the much - loved " goosebumps " and " @entity7 " series			1
the latter was a major hit , selling 80 million copies and building a fan base that for years has been asking him to revive the spooky series			2
" the whole thing happened because of @entity31 , " @entity10 said			2
" it 's a great way to keep in touch with my original readers , and ' @entity7 ' was mentioned more than anything else			2
that 's what they read when they were kids			0
and i suppose we 're all nostalgic for what we read back then			0
" @entity1 aims to give adults ' goosebumps ' the new " @entity7 " arrives at a time many consider to be a renaissance of young adult horror			1
it disappeared as a dominant genre in the early 2000s with the rise of fantasy novels and series such as " @entity53 " and " @entity54			2
" popular shows such as " @entity56 " and " @entity57 " helped revive interest in horror literature , said @entity60 , young adult editor for the @entity61			1
like today 's tv shows , today 's teen horror novels are darker and scarier than the " @entity7 " of the 1990s , reflecting the way popular culture has changed			1
along with @entity10 , a new class of authors is attempting to redefine young adult horror for the " @entity70 " generation , which can easily find graphic depictions of violence on tv and in movies and video games			1
by weaving in diverse elements -- such as historic gothic and psychological thrillers -- and making both protagonists and villains more three - dimensional , this new wave of authors is hoping to appeal to readers looking for something more than gore and torture porn			0
unlike horror depicted on television and the big screen , in horror literature for young adults , subtlety is key , rather than shock value , author and horror expert @entity96 said			1
" modern teen horror goes more inside the personal experience rather than the body count , " he said			1
" the more subtle you go and leave for the reader to interpret , they can participate and it 's even scarier			0
" a brief history of young adult literature where it began , where it 's going			0
the definition of teen horror can be difficult to pinpoint , especially as new authors broaden the range of topics contained within the genre			1
in the broadest sense , it embodies the disturbing , imaginative manifestations of fear and dread , life - or - death situations , thrilling surprises and a loss of control , authors and literary observers say			0
horror is defined by what scares you , " and that 's very personal and different for each person , " said @entity60 , who reviews young adult horror in @entity61 's ' @entity134 ' blog			2
horror novels by @entity10 , @entity136 and @entity137 emerged as a salve to the 1970s and 1980s ' " problem novels " that dealt with divorce , drugs and alcohol abuse			1
in the early 2000s , authors began began weaving elements of horror into fantasy , such as the " @entity53 " series			1
horror was the umbrella genre that gave birth to popular subgenres such as paranormal and dystopian , @entity60 said			2
as the genre evolved , it began attracting more readers with its diversity of subgenres and topics			0
themes of empowerment and hope emerged , showcasing teens defeating evil in the face of their greatest fears -- and surviving to the end of the book , @entity60 said			0
readers sound off : books that changed your lives " i look at @entity173 horror as being the swords and shields we give our teens to fight with these problems that we have limited ways of coping with , " @entity60 said			1
" teen horror stories are actually empowering them against these horrific things in their life			1
to have their own stories and their own ways of fighting back , i think we give them a voice			0
" @entity190 , @entity191 , april @entity192 and @entity193 are some of the authors folding in suspense and elements of psychological terror into horror novels			2
" horror combines what readers love by merging the scary creatures from ' @entity203 ' and gritty , horrifying elements of dystopian ( literature ) , " gothic horror author @entity190 said			2
" @entity206 can be a genre of its own but finds its way into almost every other genre			0
" @entity212 , author of a young @entity214 series , believes that part of the appeal of modern young adult horror is the shift away from crazed serial killers to demons within ourselves			1
case in point : zombies , monsters of our own creation			0
zombies connect well with the teen experience , standing as a metaphor for misunderstanding , loss or massive life changes and how characters handle the consequences , @entity96 said			1
@entity235 , author of " warm bodies , " which was adapted for the big screen in february 2013 , did n't write his book for young adults			0
but they connected with the message : figuring out who you are and who you want to be , even if you 're a zombie , he said			0
his book is told from the perspective of a zombie who feels lost until he meets ( and does n't want to eat ) a living person			0
" it always seemed strange to me that there was no curiosity about what 's going on behind the scenes of this creature , " @entity235 said			0
young adult books from page to screen new twists to old favorites for years , fans have been asking @entity10 to revive " @entity7 " in online fan forums and over social media			1
but publishers were n't interested , claiming the idea he left behind in 1995 was outdated in the new world of young adult fiction dominated by dystopian worlds and paranormal events			0
@entity10 took to @entity31 , thanking his fans for their interest while letting them know that the idea was discouraged			2
then , associate editor @entity275 of @entity276 , a division of @entity277 , reached out to him			0
the " @entity7 " series married supernatural horror with real - life horror of teenagers ' deepest fears and insecurities			1
that 's why they were so popular with young readers , @entity275 said , including herself			0
she thought it was fitting that the grandfather of teen horror revisit his most popular series for old fans and a new generation			1
young adult books that changed our lives while the @entity302 " recipe " remains the same -- following one character 's perspective closely -- @entity10 says the new " @entity7 " books will be longer , more adult and more violent , reflecting how young adult fiction has changed since the 1990s			1
" for me , it 's thinking of new scares , plot twists and cliffhanger chapter endings i have n't done before , moving into the modern world , " @entity10 said			2
" it will be a roller coaster ride of fearful surprises			0
" follow @entity314 on @entity31			0
