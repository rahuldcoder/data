@entity0 -- president @entity3 's embattled pick to be ambassador to @entity5 withdrew his nomination monday , a day before facing an uncertain vote in the @entity8			1
@entity9 came under fire from @entity11 and some @entity12 for a variety of complaints ; most notably for what senators said was poor judgment when he used an official government e-mail account to exchange flirtatious e-mails with a @entity20 reporter while the two were stationed in @entity22 in 2008			1
the two were later married			0
in his resignation letter , @entity9 said his withdrawal " is in the best interests of the country " because " @entity5 urgently needs an ambassador			1
" @entity9 's wife : i 've become ' collateral damage ' " the most difficult part of this process , " @entity9 said , " was watching my wife become a part of it			1
she is the most precious thing in the world to me , and the depiction of our relationship has been both surreal and devastating			0
we have also witnessed real sacrifice and suffering in @entity5 and know that nothing should be allowed to distract from the pressing work that must be done to build a better future there			0
" @entity9 said he made the decision to withdraw saturday and , in dramatic language , revealed it came as he was visiting the section in @entity51 " where so many heroes of the @entity5 and @entity54 wars now rest in peace			1

" @entity11 senators oppose choice of nominee for @entity5 envoy it was not clear if the @entity8 would have approved @entity9			1
the committee is made up of 10 @entity12 and nine republicans , and therefore , a single @entity81 could have blocked @entity9 's nomination if all @entity11 voted against him			2
at least two @entity12 -- @entity83 of @entity84 and @entity85 of @entity86 -- said they had concerns about the nomination			0
six @entity11 members of the committee wrote the president last week urging him to withdraw @entity9 's nomination because they said he lacked the management experience to run such a large embassy and because they say he " botched " negotiations over the @entity96 for post-war @entity5			2
of the controversial e-mails , the @entity11 said : " the public release of information detailing unprofessional conduct demonstrates poor judgment and will affect the nominee 's credibility in the country where he has been nominated to serve			1

in an e-mail to friends friday , she said the e-mails she traded with @entity9 " which were exposed just before @entity9 's confirmation hearing reflected flirtatious banter and nothing more			1
