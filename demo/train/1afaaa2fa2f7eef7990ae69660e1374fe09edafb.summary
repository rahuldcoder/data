-- last night i sat down to watch the @entity3 red carpet with my 6 - year - old daughter @entity4			1
she played dress - up with her @entity8 doll while i followed the commentary on @entity10			2
" look , @entity11 ! @entity14 's all ready for the red carpet , " she exclaimed , showing off the updo she created for her doll			1
she watched with mild interest until the moment we 'd been waiting for arrived : nine - year - old @entity19 appeared in a frenzy of flashing camera lights with her mom and sister in tow			1
" look , @entity11 , there she is ! look at her purse ! it 's a puppy ! " @entity4 jumped up and down			1
" i want one of those ! " parenting.com : the best moments of the 2013 @entity3 what a moment ! i wanted my daughter to see a little girl , just like her , walking the red carpet among the most talented women in @entity37			1
she was sassy and confident while talking to reporters			2
and she was dressed in a perfectly age - appropriate @entity40 gown that she chose because " it 's sparkly ! " her mom looked on , proud as can be			1
i had a tear in my eye			0
" do you know that she 's going to play @entity47 in the new movie ? " i asked			1
@entity4 's smile was so big			1
" wow , mommy ! she 's the luckiest girl in the world ! " i have been a huge fan of @entity19 from the moment i saw the trailer for " @entity54			1
" she made the movie when she was only six years old and earned herself a best actress @entity3 nomination for her performance			1
she deserves a standing ovation from us			0
instead , last night , on her special night , she was subjected to the most distasteful showing of adult " humor " i have ever seen			0
it started with a " joke " by @entity3 host @entity65 about how it will be " sixteen years before she 's too old " for @entity68 , but sadly it did n't stop there			1
the popular satire site @entity70 tweeted the following to its more than 4 million followers during the show last night : " everyone else seems afraid to say it , but that @entity19 is kind of a _ _ _ _ , right ? " ( if you want to see the actual tweet , it 's here			1
) as if it was n't bad enough that she was sexualized in front of her peers during what was undoubtedly the most exciting night of her life , but to be further humiliated on a social networking site and called one of the most degrading terms that can be used toward women is reprehensible			0
the @entity70 is a site known for its sarcasm and although i 'm sure they did n't mean it , does that make it better ? am i supposed to laugh at the absurdity of the statement ? am i supposed to look at my daughter and think , wow , it would be really really funny and smart if someone jokingly called her the c word ? how ironic			1
parenting.com : celebrity baby bumps on the red carpet many online have tried to make this a race issue			0
saying she was singled out because she 's a young black girl			1
i hope that 's not the case			2
to me , this has less to do with race and everything to do with the fact that we have stopped respecting the innocence of our children			1
we 've become so desensitized by the " @entity118 " culture that we take hurtful aim at those who epitomize childhood as much as the fluffy puppy purses they carry on the red carpet			0
imagine what went through @entity19 's mother 's mind when someone pulled her aside last night to tell her what happened			1
did her stomach bottom out like mine did ? did she look at her daughter with a tear in her eye and think why ? why tonight ? what is wrong with this world ? i want my little girl to know she can do anything she sets her mind to			2
she can be herself , silly purse and all , and star in whatever version of life she desires			0
@entity4 went to sleep last night clutching her @entity8 doll tight , updo still in place , as i imagine @entity147 did with her puppy purse			0
both , i am sure , completely unaware of the storm brewing online in defense of little girls like them			0
in defense of their innocence			2
when our children take their turn in the spotlight , they have the right to leave it unscathed			2
it 's our job as adults to protect them			2
parenting.com : what really happens when dad 's in charge i wish the headlines today were different			2
i wish we lived in a world where @entity19 could wake up this morning and search the internet with her mama to find herself on our best - dressed lists			1
to see celebrities like @entity175 and @entity176 , her biggest fans , rave about her			0
instead her family must hide the horrible truth from her -- the truth that our media took a cheap shot at someone too small to stand up for herself or to even know what the word she was called means			2
the way we treat our kids is no laughing matter			0
@entity19 is a lot of things			1
and she is a child			0
she is not the c word			0
but thanks to the insensitive staffer at the onion who decided to tweet and then recant the vulgar comment , this incident too is one of the ways she 'll be remembered			0
parenting.com : the best books to read with your kids as chief executive @entity204 of the @entity70 wrote in his apology this morning , " @entity203 , you are young and talented and deserve better			0
all of us at the @entity70 are deeply sorry			0
" we all are , little girl			0

@entity216 and her daughter watched the @entity3 to see @entity19
@entity219 found the treatment of @entity19 by the media to be humiliating
the author *laments* a lack of cultural respect for children 's innocence
