-- the tragic death of @entity2 has once again taught us a bitter lesson : @entity5 does not discriminate , can not be bargained with and shows no mercy			1
@entity5 does not care how wonderful your life is or how many people you 've touched			1
@entity2 seemed to have it all : he was adored by fans , loved by family and friends and had fame and fortune			1
but it did n't matter , because someone suffering severe depression can not feel the joy and satisfaction that comes with even the best things in life			1
as a society , we need to hear these collective cries for help and take depression seriously as a public health issue			1
@entity2 and the dark side of comedy @entity2 is not the first and wo n't be the last celebrity to have struggled with depression or mental disorder			1
@entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and many others have all made the point that depression can hit anyone at any time for any reason			2
@entity43 suffered from bipolar disorder before his suicide			2
@entity46 was rumored to be depressed before she hung herself			0
the @entity47 estimates 350 million people worldwide suffer from some form of depression			2
when mental illness affects your family @entity5 is characterized by intense and prolonged sadness and / or anhedonia ( loss of pleasure )			1
symptoms including low energy , loss of concentration , sleep and eating disturbance and feelings of guilt and worthlessness can accompany depression			0
it is not exclusively an adult disorder			0
it can begin in childhood or adolescence and last throughout life with possible relapses			0
some people can suffer major depression , others mild			0
there 's also bipolar disorder , which is characterized by manic episodes and depressive episodes			0
opinion : @entity2 and depression : we all wear a mask @entity5 is one of the leading causes of loss of productivity and disability			1
it 's devastating on relationships			0
depressed individuals will often experience sadness and be unable to experience pleasure , making it difficult to feel or express love toward others			0
there is also evidence suggesting that depression may be linked to chronic diseases			0
the worse is that depression is one of the most consistent risk factors for suicide			1
so what can be done ? the field is still evolving			0
in more severe or chronic cases , the combination of medication and psychotherapy has shown to be particularly potent			0
there are ways for treatment to be cost - effective			0
but there are barriers that need to be overcome to adequately address depression			1
first and foremost , the stigma of depression is making us sicker			2
from an early age , children describe each other as " crazy " or " weird			0
" this can often result in teasing and bullying for children with mental health issues , and social distancing from adults			1
as a result , individuals struggling with depression will often feel worse as a result of this mistreatment and be less likely to seek care			2
going public with depression eradicating the stigma of mental illness must be a public health priority			1
for years , groups such as the @entity142 have fought to reduce stigma			0
those on the front lines of working with people with mental illness should receive adequate education and support to manage bias			0
integrating mental health screening in primary care settings is another important step , as the @entity153 has determined that this improves outcomes			1
furthermore , the @entity155 of 2013 expanded upon the @entity156 and @entity157 of 2008 , providing more possibility that mental health conditions will be covered at similar rates to physical health conditions			1
opinion : suicide does n't set you free as we break down barriers and improve understanding of depression , we will hopefully reduce the number of tragedies			2
we should n't have to lose some of our brightest lights like @entity2 .			2
