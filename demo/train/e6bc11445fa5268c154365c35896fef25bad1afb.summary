allegations of lewd acts committed by a teacher on students in a @entity5 - area elementary school sent shockwaves across the community last year			1
but the outrage did n't end there			2
amid a year - long police investigation involving dozens of photos showing the alleged acts , the school district -- faced with strict state rules -- could not fire the teacher			1
instead , it paid him $ 40,000 to quit his job			1
police arrested @entity18 , 61 , in january and charged him with 23 felony counts stemming from allegations that he bound young students and then photographed them with semen - filled spoons held at their mouths and 3 - inch cockroaches crawling across their faces			1
investigators believe the children did n't realize that they were being victimized , thinking they were playing a game			1
@entity30 pleaded not guilty to the charges and is being held on $ 23 million bail while he awaits trial , expected next year			2
the @entity18 found itself caught between protecting children and protecting the legal rights of a teacher who had been accused of -- but not formally charged with -- serious crimes against children			1
under @entity41 's due process for teachers , the school district could have kept @entity30 on paid administrative leave , but it would have had to engage in lengthy legal wrangling to remove him from his position			1
that process could have taken months , even years , and there are no exceptions for teachers accused of sex crimes against children			1
outraged by the @entity30 case , @entity41 state sen. @entity51 drafted a bill this year that would have allowed a faster way for schools to fire teachers accused of the most heinous crimes against children			1
" we were very specific to those serious and egregious crimes , " @entity58 said of the bill			1
" @entity63 , drugs , violence involving students			0
these are no - brainers			0
" while senators overwhelmingly voted in support of @entity69 , it was met with strong opposition from the powerful @entity71			0
the teachers ' union says that @entity58 's bill would have eliminated essential legal protections for teachers and that it believes the current system is an appropriate process			1
in the halls of the state @entity81 , assemblymember @entity79 veered sharply away from @entity84 's camera without stopping to answer questions about her refusal to cast a vote on @entity58 's bill			1
her aide swung a palm over the camera , saying , " no comment			0
" @entity79 is one of 11 members of the @entity95 , which considered @entity96 after it passed the state @entity98			1
the bill needed a simple majority from the committee before it could go on to the full assembly			1
but the bill failed by one vote			2
four members -- including @entity79 -- were present but abstained from the vote			0
" i think it 's spineless , and i think it 's gutless , " said former state sen. @entity106 , who used to head the @entity95			2
" they go there to vote , not to remain silent when their name 's called			0
that , to me , is what 's disgusting , " said @entity106 , who now works to reform @entity41 's educational system with @entity115			1
by refusing to vote , @entity106 said , the lawmakers can avoid looking bad to their constituents while keeping the campaign contributions from @entity41 's powerful education unions flowing			1
she said she believes the four lawmakers abstained " out of fear and intimidation that those campaign dollars will no longer flow their way			0
" those members of the @entity102 's @entity95 who voted " no " or did n't cast a vote received more campaign contributions from teachers ' unions than their fellow committee members except the chairman , according to data from @entity135 , which bills itself as a nonprofit , nonpartisan research group dedicated to looking at money 's influence on politics			0
from january 2009 to may 2012 , " teachers ' unions gave 5.4 times as much ( campaign contributions ) to the committee members who voted ' no ' versus the ones who voted ' yes , ' " said @entity140 , @entity135 's co-founder and president			0
" the people who voted ' yes ' got much less money than the people who voted ' no ' and voted ' no vote			0
' you can see how the money correlates with the vote			0
it shows interest groups that invest in politics buy results			0
" the @entity71 maintains that its campaign contributions to lawmakers were not the driving factor in convincing them to vote down or not vote on the measure			0
it described the bill as " unnecessary legislation that would have eroded ( teachers ' ) rights during dismissal proceedings			2
" but @entity140 says it 's all part of a corrupt system across the country in which lawmakers spend much of their time in office raising money for campaigns			0
that makes them have to bend to campaign contributions in the " corrupt system of money - dominated politics , " he said			0
" this pattern of contribution is very similar on bill after bill , on topic after topic , whether it affects unions , banks , corporations , " he said			2
" on average , the lawmakers vote with the side that tends to give them the most money			0
" all but one of the four assembly members refused repeated requests for comment about why they abstained from voting on the measure			0
assemblymember @entity200 explained that he felt that " the bill was too much of an overreach " and he was concerned about its effect on teachers ' rights			2
@entity200 said he is now working with @entity58 to possibly revive the measure or create a similar measure that addresses his concerns			0
but it could be too little too late for the @entity5 school district , which is facing a lawsuit filed by the mothers of the 23 children at the center of the charges against @entity30			1
the lawsuit , filed in july , seeks unspecified damages and school district reforms			2
it accuses the district of maintaining " a practice and custom of maintaining a ' @entity222 ' to hide teacher misconduct , and to ignore teacher misconduct			2

a @entity41 teacher was charged with lewd acts on children
the case shed light on the *dilemma* school *boards* face
the board could not fire the teacher , only place him on paid leave
a state bill seeking to change that was thwarted
