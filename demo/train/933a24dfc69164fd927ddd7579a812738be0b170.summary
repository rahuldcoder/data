-- the amateur video shows men , shirtless and seeming dangerously drunk , rolling on the ground or staggering near a counter top covered with booze bottles			0
another part of the video shows a man babbling incoherently with a syringe nearby			1
this is not a scene at a college frat house			0
it is a video of employees of an @entity16 security contractor working in @entity17 , @entity18			2
" it reminded me of times i 'd visit my friends going to college that were in fraternities , " said @entity19 , a former employee of @entity20 who was based at that villa in @entity17 on assignment to support efforts to train @entity25 security personnel			2
the images in this video are now part of a lawsuit by two former employees of @entity20 who allege that contractors with the firm were careless with their guns , abused local staffers , wrecked cars , destroyed furniture , and often could not perform their duties due to drunkenness			1
" this behavior actually was almost every other night , " said @entity44 , another former employee there , who filmed the videos in january and february			1
@entity44 and @entity19 have filed the lawsuit and cite an example of one night in february of 2012 where several employees were allegedly " heavily intoxicated and grabbing at each other 's weapons and firing them in the air			1
" in one of the videos , which were obtained by @entity0 , a raging bonfire burns in a pit			2
the lawsuit alleges that drunken revelers threw ammunition on the fire which exploded , causing a serious laceration on the brow of a local employee			1
the result of the misconduct , it says , was undermanned security , missed work , and damage to relations with @entity25 people and officials			2
" @entity75 employees were often too intoxicated to perform their duties , " the lawsuit claims			1
in a statement , @entity77 said the behavior was " unacceptable " and added , " the @entity80 is deeply concerned about any employee misconduct			1
" the firm has implemented a no - drinking policy as well as made management changes , a @entity75 representative said			2
none of the people seen in the videos work for @entity75 anymore , the firm says			2
@entity75 " pledges to fully investigate and correct any mistakes to preserve and continue its history of exemplary performance , " the statement concluded			0
but @entity77 rejected the suggestion that work was compromised			1
" the company remains confident that the personal misconduct did not impact the @entity80 's contract performance , " the statement said			1
@entity101 , @entity44 and @entity19 's attorney , disagrees			0
" these people were drunk beyond the point of incoherence , and could not possibly defend themselves if they were attacked , " he said			0
the company says the workers seen in the videos would not have been tasked with defending the compound , since they had administrative roles and support roles , rather than top security jobs			1
but @entity101 disputes that and says the company is downplaying the roles of the men in the videos			1
" that is a gross understatement of what these individuals did , " said @entity101			0
" these individuals are the security manager for the facility , and the operations manager for security for the entire country of @entity18 for the company			0
" @entity0 was unable to reach either of those men , or another man , seen in the video , which was first reported on by @entity132			0
the military is supposed to oversee such contractors , and the @entity136 's @entity135 is now looking into the allegations			0
" the @entity139 and @entity16 @entity18 take all allegations of inappropriate behavior by contractors and service members very seriously , " said an @entity139 spokesman			0
but @entity144 , of the nonprofit watchdog group @entity145 , said she is concerned that the @entity16 is relying too much on contractors , who work in miserable conditions , with too little oversight			0
the kind of misconduct seen in the videos - even if rare - risks undermining the @entity16 mission in @entity18 , she said			1
" this is the kind of behavior that is making people in the area - afghans - have more disregard for the @entity16 who are there , " she said .			0

the videos are part of a lawsuit by two former employees
the company says it has made changes since the videos were made *public*
