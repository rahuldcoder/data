-- the photographer who took the picture of a man about to be fatally struck by a @entity5 subway car said thursday that he did so in a desperate attempt to alert the driver of the train to stop			1
" from where i was , i could have screamed my lungs out ; probably nobody would have heard it , " @entity9 told @entity0 's @entity10 about the incident monday in which 58 - year - old @entity12 had been shoved onto the tracks in a times square station as a train approached			1
" the only way , i thought at that moment , was to start clicking away , releasing the shutter that will fire the flash , and make him aware that this is an unusual occurrence -- why is there a burst of light hitting him -- and catch mr. @entity12 on the track			1
" @entity9 , who asked that @entity0 note that he was not paid for the interview ( @entity0 does not pay for any interviews ) , estimated that he had been 400 feet from @entity12 when he saw in his peripheral vision a body being flung onto the tracks			1
" there was a collective gasp that went into the air that really got my attention , " he said			0
" people started waving their hands and screaming because , a few moments earlier , they had made an announcement that the train will be approaching the station and i could see the distant lights of the approaching train			1
" @entity9 said he started running toward @entity12 but stood aside and braced himself against the wall when he realized that the suspect was approaching him			1
" he seemed agitated , and as he was approaching , he was cursing and using profanities			0
" @entity9 said the only thing he might have done differently would have been to urge @entity12 to try to outrun the train			1
" i would have said , ' mr. @entity12 , run the other direction , ' " he said			1
" there were only about three cars in the station and all he had to do was outrun three cars and he would have lived			0
" @entity9 said he would have saved @entity12 had he been able to do so			1
" it was n't important to get the photograph ; the photograph came out as a result of my effort -- or what i could think at that moment to do			0
" though he said he heard others urging @entity12 to get up , " i do n't know why anyone did not reach out			1
" @entity9 said @entity12 's end came quickly			1
" i could hear the sounds , " he said			0
" i do not want to be too graphic about it for respect for the family , but i could hear all the sounds			0
mr. @entity12 did not scream or anything , this is how fast it transpired			1
" the whole experience , he said , has been traumatic for him			0
" if i have to narrate the whole thing , it 's like reliving it			2
i did not sleep for close to 36 , 40 hours			0
" even three days later , he said , the photograph is chilling to him			0
" it 's like i am looking at his end			2
and the oncoming train -- the metaphor for it -- death staring him down			2
" @entity9 dismissed those who say he should have helped as " armchair critics			0
" @entity90 , 30 , a homeless man , was arraigned late wednesday in @entity12 's death and charged with second - degree murder			1
his next scheduled court appearance is tuesday			0
opinion : why the outrage over photo in subway death @entity9 said he did n't look at the pictures before returning to the office and turning his camera 's memory card over to police			1
the @entity103 published them the next day			1
" doomed " the headline screamed			0
" pushed on the subway track , this man is about to die			2
" readers and media critics quickly jumped on the newspaper 's decision to use the image			1
on @entity114 , users posted that it was cruel and " snuff porn			0
" @entity117 , a media critic and editor in chief of the website @entity121 , called it " profit - motive journalism at its worst			1
" " it 's insensitive , it 's inappropriate , it 's sickening rubbernecking , " she said wednesday			0
but @entity128 , host of @entity0 's " @entity129 " and the @entity131 bureau chief for @entity132 and @entity133 , said he sees an argument for publishing the image			2
" because this is every @entity5 's nightmare , " he said			0
" i do still wonder why the photographer 's first instinct was to take pictures , " he said			2
" i do wonder that			0
" @entity141 , a fellow at the journalism think tank @entity143 , wrote on the organization 's website that it appeared journalists were largely critical of the decision			2
" even if you accept that that photographer and other bystanders did everything they could to try to save the man , it 's a separate question of what the @entity103 should have done with that photo , " he wrote			1
" all journalists we 've seen talking about it online concluded the @entity103 was wrong to use the photo , especially on its front page			1
" @entity161 , a senior faculty member for visual journalism and diversity programs at @entity143 , said tuesday that what the paper did was n't necessarily wrong			0
" it was not illegal or unethical given that ethical guidelines and recommendations are not absolute , " he said in an e-mail			0
but he also said the @entity103 should have used another image			1
" this moment was such for me -- it was too private in my view , " he wrote			0
" i am all for maximizing truth telling , while minimizing harm , which can be done by fully vetting the alternatives available and publishing with a sense of compassion and respect			0
" the @entity103 is no stranger to walking up to the lines of journalistic ethics -- and sometimes crossing them -- with its pithy , often lurid , coverage of crime and other news in the @entity186			2
" @entity103 , " the newspaper once famously shouted from its cover			2
nor is the @entity103 shot the first news photo to generate ethics concerns			1
an @entity192 photo that won the 2012 @entity193 generated controversy for its depiction of a girl in @entity197 crying amid a number of bloody bodies			0
also this year , the @entity200 published a graphic image showing blood streaming from the body of a victim after a fatal august shooting at the @entity206			2
at the time , @entity207 quoted a @entity200 spokeswoman as saying the image was " a newsworthy photograph that shows the result and impact of a public act of violence			2
" @entity0 's @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 and @entity217 contributed to this report .			0
