fears for the fate of more than 200 @entity3 girls turned even more nightmarish monday when the leader of the @entity6 militant group that kidnapped them announced plans to sell them			1

i will sell them in the market , by @entity18 , " a man claiming to be @entity13 leader @entity12 said in a video first obtained by @entity15			1

" but he also criticized the girls ' parents , saying they were n't cooperating fully with police			2
" what we request is maximum cooperation from the guardians and the parents of these girls			2
because up to this time , they have not been able to come clearly , to give the police clear identity of the girls that have yet to return , " he said			2

@entity3 's finance minister said monday that her country 's government remains committed to finding the girls , but should have done a better job explaining the situation to the public			1
" have we communicated what is being done properly ? the answer is no , that people did not have enough information , " @entity114 told @entity26 's @entity115			1
