-- even in retirement @entity3 -- arguably @entity2 's most celebrated racehorse with 25 victories from 25 starts -- shows no sign of fading from the media glare			1
only recently the mare grabbed plenty of headlines after a statue was erected in her honor			2
but another equine retirement in recent weeks has passed without quite the same fanfare -- vote for @entity17 being put out to pasture			1
vote for @entity17 is the cart horse to super mare @entity3			1
" he 's just really , really bad , " the horse 's owner and trainer @entity22 told @entity0			1
" he just does n't go fast			0
" retirement came after its 90th run out -- ninety rides that came and went without a solitary victory			1
for all his lack of pace and panache on the race track -- vote for @entity17 's career fittingly ended with him being 12 - and - a - half lengths off the pace in his racing finale -- he has enjoyed something of a cult following in @entity2 , with both a @entity41 and @entity42 page set up in his name			1
vote for @entity17 is indisputably @entity2 's worst race horse , with his closest rival being @entity47 , who had 67 starts without a win			1
as for laying claim to being the world 's worst , vote for @entity17 is in with a good shout , although he has some serious competition			1
@entity57 horse @entity55 was the first thoroughbred to lose 100 races in @entity60 in 2000 while the @entity62 horse @entity63 also went 100 races without a win and also even lost a race with a minor - league baseball player			1
fan favorite but even vote for @entity17 's owner and trainer @entity22 struggles to believe that there could possibly be a worse horse on the planet			1
despite the track record of ignominy , @entity22 admitted that hundreds of suitors had been lining up to buy this @entity2 underachiever after his retirement was announced			1
but family came first for @entity22 , who gave @entity81 to his 14 - year - old granddaughter			1
she is able to give him the sort of slow - speed riding that the 10 - year - old specialized on the race course during his career			1
during vote for @entity17 's career punters laid all manner of bets on him to win -- all to no avail -- though @entity22 was wily enough never to dip into his pocket to back the ultimate no hoper			1
" he 's beaten one or two out there at home but never in a race , " said @entity22			1
twice on @entity99 day , vote for @entity17 ran in a two - horse race and on each occasion came home a distant second			1
his last realistic chance for victory came at the @entity106 in june 2009 , a race specifically for horses that have never won			2
true to form @entity109 was nowhere to be seen at the winning post			0
sociable horse even jockey @entity112 -- a three - time @entity99 winner -- could not get anything out of the luckless horse in a one - off outing			2
with the horse sponsored by the betting company @entity118 , @entity112 was brought in to ride him in his 87th outing in a public relations gimmick			0
" there was a point where i thought ' here we go ' , but that lasted all of about 100 meters before his usual canter kicked in , " said @entity112 , who attributed @entity17 for @entity123 's lack of competitiveness to his amiability			1
" he likes the outing but he 's sociable and just wants to stay in the pack with his mates			2
if he could have a beer and a steak sandwich , i reckon he would			0
" at the time , the jockey was asked if he felt vote for @entity17 might finally pull off a victory in what was then the twilight of his career			1
his answer was , " never say never , " though @entity22 's assessment , admittedly with a chuckle , was more brutal -- " never			2
" there is a certain parental pride from the owner in just how bad @entity109 was			2
" if he 'd have won that would have been no good would it ? " he said			0
" anyway , it just was not meant to be			0
" in the yard , he was known as either ' @entity155 ' or ' @entity156 ' although @entity22 admitted : " there might have been other names too depending on what sort of mood i was in ! " @entity2 love a trier and to his credit there were times when @entity109 showed a glimmer of form -- usually in adverse weather conditions			1
" there were a couple of occasions early on in his career when the rain was lashing down and he just kept on ploughing through			0
i thought he might have done it then			0
when he did n't do it then , i think i knew he 'd never do it			0
" calm nature so why did @entity22 keep on entering him in races ? " well , horses do n't pay for themselves do they ? " said vote for @entity17 's owner			1
" and anyway he 'd still pick up some money for his places which would cover his feed and keep really			0
" for all the negativity about his racing prowess , or lack of it , vote for @entity17 was invaluable as a horse for all occasions away from the track			1
" he was good to have around the place , he was everyone 's mate , " said @entity22			2
" he was quiet as hell and we 'd take him to partner horses			0
he was so good natured , the calming influence on the more jittery horses			0
he just did everything you 'd ever ask of him , that is apart from going fast			0
" when we were breaking in horses , we 'd have him tied up at the side and he 'd just calm everyone down			0
he 's just a bloody good bloke			2
for us , he was gold dust			0
" at races , @entity109 would welcome bigger crowds than the faster more successful horses			0
" he 's got quite a cult following , do n't you worry about that , " added @entity22			2
" everyone would want to get his picture taken with him			0
it 's crazy to think someone put him on the internet and he ended up with hundreds of people following him			2
" just as he retired , we had seven radio stations ring up for interviews , and people rang up asking if he was for sale			2
he 's much loved , just sadly not for the right reasons			2
" equine genealogy vote for @entity17 would still be racing had it not been for an abscess on his foot			1
@entity22 had hoped to take him to at least 100 runs , after which he planned to host some sort of a party			0
in the end , that was not to be			0
as for how he might have fared against @entity3 , @entity22 is certain that would have definitely have been a one horse race			1
" there was a suggestion that he 'd challenge @entity3 in a race , " said @entity22			1
" that would have been the mother of all mismatches			0
" it is just a few weeks since he handed over the horse to his granddaughter , and he readily admits he misses having him around the place			0
but there is the potential for someone to follow in his footsteps			0
he has a half - sister and half - brother in @entity22 's stable			2
the latter has been named ' @entity259 n't my brother ' to distance himself from his equine genealogy			0
despite that , he ca n't quite break the family shackles			0
in his few races to date , he has yet to taste victory .			0

vote for @entity17 failed to win a single race in 90 appearances before his recent retirement
ranked as @entity2 's worst racehorse -- by some distance
@entity274 recently retired and now is being ridden by the owner 's granddaughter
there was once talk of a one - sided *showdown* with @entity2 great @entity3
