on the glass entrance to the @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity5 , you 'll find all the usual museum particulars : closed monday , here 's our website , find us on @entity10 , etc. and then this : " no weapons allowed except guitars			1
" it 's tribute to the fact that @entity15 -- who wrote " @entity16 " and who basically was @entity18 before @entity18 was @entity18 -- used folk music to battle indifference to social inequities in the 1930s and ' 40s			1
his stories were those of @entity28 refugees fleeing the @entity29 for @entity30 ; of underpaid workers ; of people who believed in the promise and @entity34 but who the country sold short			2
" i 'm too sober to foreclose on a widow			2
" that 's from one of his notebooks at the @entity3			1
we need more @entity15 today			2
on tuesday , president @entity43 is expected , once again , to make a plea for the country to address its blemish that 's bigger than the one in @entity48 's mug shot : income inequality			1
as was the case in @entity15 's time , we 're living in two @entity52 , not one			1
in the rich @entity58 , the one inhabited by members of @entity57 , a majority of whom are now millionaires , finding work and living comfortably is easy as ever			2
in poorer @entity58 , jobs are scarce and pay nothing close to a living wage			2
the middle has hollowed out			2
our economy has been @entity66 since the late 1970s			2
measured by the wonky gini coefficient , the @entity58 is now more economically split than countries like @entity69 , @entity70 and the @entity71			2
we 're among the worst in the developed world			2
you probably do n't need me to tell you that			1
there are hundreds of articles on this subject , on every major website			0
and the president , to his credit , has brought this up again and again			1
in his 2012 @entity83 , he called income inequality " the defining issue of our time			1
" the problem : no one 's listening			1
his job approval rating is at 40 % , according to @entity91 , for a variety of reasons			0
and , let 's face it , the @entity83 can be a snoozefest			1
viewership , according to @entity96 , is steadily down over @entity43 's presidency , from 52.4 million viewers in 2009 to 33.5 million in 2013 , a decline of 36 %			1
and half the fun of the @entity83 in the @entity102 era is watching to see if " @entity104 " @entity103 is capable of emotion and what the @entity107 justices might be muttering to themselves			0
people understand income inequality is a thing , now			1
and maybe that 's a start			1
but i 'd argue few understand why , beyond the numbers , it really matters			0
that 's where defiant songwriters like @entity15 should come in			1
as @entity122 was quick to tell me , contenders for the title of modern @entity15 do exist			1
suggestions you posted there ranged from @entity126 to @entity127 , a @entity129 electronic group , and @entity130 , a singer - songwriter from @entity5			1
and it was easy enough to see music still has a social edge if you watched the @entity135 on sunday			1
i was moved by @entity137 's performance of " @entity138 , " during which several couples , gay and straight , were married			1
meanwhile , @entity143 's @entity142 won song of the year for " @entity145 , " which touches on the class divide and wealth			1
chorus : " we will never be @entity145			0
it do n't run in our blood			1
" we need more brave artists like those in our culture			0
when i visited the @entity3 in december , i saw a copy of the original manuscript to his most famous song , " @entity16			1
" it 's the kind of thing you almost do n't stop to look at , because you figure you know the words			1
" this land was made for you and me			0
" but a friend pointed out two original verses that , i 've since read , were written in 1940 but were omitted from the popular recording in 1944			0
they 're also the verses with real staying power			0
here they are , as archived by @entity172 : as i went walking i saw a sign there and on the sign it said " no trespassing			0
" but on the other side it did n't say nothing , that side was made for you and me			1
in the shadow of the steeple i saw my people , by the relief office i seen my people ; as they stood there hungry , i stood there asking is this land made for you and me ? no wonder the @entity193 adopted @entity15 as a folk hero			0
if only they had his wit and vision , maybe the rest of us would have paid more attention			0
the " i seen my people " verse , the song 's sixth , is the most haunting and relevant in 2014			1
the problem today , as i see it , is that most of us have n't seen our people			2
this is the real threat of income inequality : not that some people are rich and the everyone else is jealous of them , as the @entity214 camp postulated , but that the gap between the haves and have - nots has grown so wide that we do n't see each other			1
i witnessed this last year on a trip to the " most unequal place in @entity58 , " @entity221 , @entity222			0
the rich are on one side of a lake in that parish ; the poor the other			0
there are people who know almost nothing of how the other side lives			0
along with gaps in income come gaps in empathy and trust			2
violence , mental illness and all sorts of social ills , can follow , as researchers argue in a powerful book called " @entity241 : why @entity242			0
" just look to @entity243 to see relative equality is more harmonious			0
these gaps emerge in communities across @entity58			0
@entity247 and poor live @entity248 in large cities , but we still remain invisible -- intentionally so , painfully so			0
@entity251 , where i live , reportedly bulldozed a tent camp under a major interstate this month			0
that it was unsightly and commonly seen could well have had something to do with it , too			0
those of us who are lucky to be comfortably employed are too quick to forget about what it 's like to really struggle			2
and we do n't like to see the people who are struggling			2
as they stood there hungry , i stood there asking is this land made for you and me ? @entity58 is comfortable saying this is a land made ... for me			0
our challenge : realizing that this country only remains the land of opportunity if it works for all of us			0
not just the pop stars , most of whom are so obsessed with their own fame and gratification that they barely give a nod to reality ; not just for @entity282 ; and not just for those of us lucky to have an education , health care and housing			0
" i am out to sing songs that will prove to you that this is your world , " @entity15 once said			0
take that as a challenge			0
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity294 .			1

@entity0 's @entity296 visits the @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity5
he says the singer 's populist ethic is sorely needed in modern music
