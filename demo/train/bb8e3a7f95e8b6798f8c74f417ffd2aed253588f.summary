@entity0 -- nine septembers have come and gone and yet , the many days that separate @entity5 now from a chilling day in its history did not dull remembrance saturday			1
once again , the nation paused in silence to mark the times when hijacked jets crashed into the @entity12 , the @entity13 and a field in @entity15 , @entity16 , and nearly 3,000 lives were lost in a matter of minutes			1
but this year , a national debate over a proposed @entity21 center near ground zero hovered over the day 's heart - stopping sorrow , and the president once again pleaded for the tolerance that has come to define @entity5			1
rallies in favor of and against the center were held later in the day			1
at @entity33 's @entity32 , adjacent to the september 11 memorial site , thousands gathered , wanting to be as close as they could to hallowed ground			1
as has become customary , the names of the 2,752 who perished at the @entity12 were read out aloud -- each belonging to a mother or father , son or daughter , husband or wife , a friend , or even a stranger			1
" we have returned to this sacred site to join our hearts together with the names of those we loved and lost , " said @entity0 mayor @entity46 at the start of the ceremony			1
" no other public tragedy has cut our city so deeply , " he said			1
" no other place is as filled with our compassion , our love , and our solidarity			1
" @entity60 befell @entity0 at 8:46 a.m. , the time when the first plane struck the @entity63			1
another moment of quiet followed a few minutes later , at 9:03 a.m. , when a second jet pierced through the @entity66			1
shortly after the second moment of silence , vice president @entity67 read a poem by @entity70			1
" build today , then strong and sure with a firm and ample base ; and ascending and secure shall tomorrow find its place			2
" with each toll of the bell , an emotional chord struck hearts			2
family members stepped forward to talk about those who were lost			2
and with each word , hot tears rolled down cheeks			2
a woman remembered her mother , @entity85			2
" although i was 11 years old when you passed , you were my best friend and the greatest mom			2
we all love you and we miss you			2
@entity89 bless you , @entity90			2
" another spoke of her sister , @entity92			2
" we will hold you close to our hearts			2
" and a brother , @entity95 , who was a @entity96 fan			2
" @entity95 , so handsome and , oh , so fine			2
with a heart of gold , why , oh why did you have to leave us behind ? and i said to myself , i know why			2
@entity89 was looking for a captain of a ship , someone who qualifies as a jedi			0
so go on , dear brother , do n't be shy			0
your ship awaits you with 2,000 and more to stand by your side , to travel with you on your journey into the sky			0
may the force be with you , @entity95			0
we love you and you are embedded in our hearts forever			0
" in his weekly address , president @entity111 highlighted the scope of @entity5 's loss			1
" we think about the milestones that have passed over the course of nine years -- births and christenings , weddings and graduations -- all with an empty chair , " he said			0
" on this day , we also honor those who died so that others might live : the firefighters and first responders who climbed the stairs of two burning towers ; the passengers who stormed a cockpit ; and the men and women who have , in the years since , borne the uniform of this country and given their lives so that our children could grow up in a safer world , " @entity111 said			1
later , @entity111 laid a wreath at the @entity13 , where @entity138 struck and killed 184 people , and sounded again a message of tolerance , keenly aware that this anniversary was cast under a different light			1
beyond the outpouring of grief on this day lay rising anti-muslim sentiment and furious controversy over a proposed @entity21 center two blocks away from where the @entity12 once soared			1
it 's an issue that has even split the families and survivors of the 2001 attacks			0
@entity0 police beefed up security as @entity5 voiced their opinions saturday afternoon at rallies over the site			1
speakers in favor of the location reminded the nation that @entity163 , too , were among the victims of the september 11 attacks and that anti-islamic sentiment in @entity5 is the result of misguided wrath			1
" @entity171 yes , racism no , " the demonstrators chanted			0
shortly afterward , opponents held their own gathering , chanting " no mosque " and " @entity5 " as speakers decried the plans and said the nation should n't forget the terrorist attack on september 11			1
attorney general @entity178 vowed the @entity179 would continue " working tirelessly to combat terrorism in all its forms and to hold accountable all those responsible for the september 11 attacks in a manner that is consistent with our nation 's values			1
" @entity178 spoke saturday at the @entity188 in @entity189			0
he paid tribute to the 72 law enforcement officers killed that day			0
" this work goes on , and it will always remain my highest priority , " @entity178 said			0
" let us take their dream of a world that is better , safer and more just and make it our own			0
" @entity111 reiterated that @entity5 is not at war with @entity21 but with @entity203 's " sorry band of men which perverts religion			1
" " they may wish to drive us apart but we will not give in to their hatred and prejudice , " he said			0
" the perpetrators of this evil act did n't simply attack @entity5 , they attacked the very idea of @entity5 itself			1
" and so the highest honor we can pay those we lost , indeed our greatest weapon in this ongoing war , is to do what our adversaries fear the most -- to stay true to who we are as @entity5 , to renew our sense of common purpose , to say that we define the character of our country and we will not let the acts of some small band of murderers who slaughter the innocent and cower in caves distort who we are , " he said			1
fueling further controversy , a @entity229 pastor had threatened to burn a @entity231 on this fateful day			0
but just before the ceremonies began , the rev. @entity232 said he was canceling the @entity231 burning planned for 6 p.m. " we will definitely not burn the quran , " rev. @entity232 told @entity236 's " today " on saturday			0
" not today , not ever			0
" in @entity15 , first lady @entity237 and former first lady @entity238 led the commemoration for the victims of flight 93 , which crashed and burned as passengers and crew fought hijackers determined to strike the @entity5 @entity245			1
" i come here as an @entity5 , filled with a sense of awe at the heroism of my fellow citizens , " @entity237 said			1
" i come as a wife , a daughter , and a sister , heartbroken at the loss so many of you have endured			0
" @entity238 said the hijackers of @entity256 had other targets in mind , but the crash spot near @entity15 " was chosen by the passengers , who spared our country from even greater horrors			0
" before his wife 's comments , @entity263 issued a statement recalling the day that came to shape his presidency			0
" on september 11 , 2001 , @entity5 awoke to evil on our shores , " he said			1
" we recall the many acts of heroism on that day , and we honor those who work tirelessly to prevent another attack			0
" in @entity0 , the ninth september 11 anniversary was also different in another way : for the first time people gathered amid signs of rebirth rising from the ashes			0
next year , on this day , a new memorial is expected to open and on saturday , the families of those who died were able to see some tangible progress of the structures that are being erected to honor their loved ones			0
the planned memorial includes six skyscrapers , a museum , two waterfalls in the footprints of the twin towers , a performance center and a rail terminal			1
the first 16 oak trees of more than 400 that will line the memorial have already been planted			0
they will surround the acre - size waterfalls around which will be the names of the dead , etched in bronze			0
earlier this week , workers installed two 50 - ton steel columns that once ringed the north tower at what will be the entrance to the memorial and museum			0
and there is a reflecting pool , around which police , firefighters and dignitaries gathered , and later throngs of people stopped to toss a solitary long - stemmed rose			0
by the time the ceremonies came to a close saturday , it had turned into to a plush blanket of bloom			0
@entity1 's @entity321 and @entity322 contributed to this report .			0
