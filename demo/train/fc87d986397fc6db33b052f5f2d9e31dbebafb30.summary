-- turns out , the best drinking stories in history are actually , well , historical			1
so raise a glass to your forefathers and marvel at these tales			0
she is not moving that fast			0
this is what the waitress would look like if you drank everything on her tray			1
admiral @entity15 's 17th - century throwdown think you can drink like a sailor ? maybe you should take a moment to reflect on what that truly means			1
the record for history 's largest cocktail belongs to @entity24 lord admiral @entity15			1
in 1694 , he threw an officer 's party that employed a garden 's fountain as the punch bowl			1
the concoction ? a mixture that included 250 gallons of brandy , 125 gallons of @entity34 wine , 1,400 pounds of sugar , 2,500 lemons , 20 gallons of lime juice , and 5 pounds of nutmeg			1
a series of bartenders actually paddled around in a small wooden canoe , filling up guests ' cups			1
not only that , but they had to work in 15 - minute shifts to avoid being overcome by the fumes and falling overboard			1
the party continued nonstop for a full week , pausing only briefly during rainstorms to erect a silk canopy over the punch to keep it from getting watered down			1
in fact , the festivities did n't end until the fountain had been drunk completely dry			1
the @entity53 - nami of 1814 the @entity54 was n't all steam engines and textile mills			1
beer production increased exponentially , as well			1
fortunately , the good people of @entity59 were up to the challenge and drained kegs as fast as they were made			1
brewery owners became known as " beer barons , " and they spent their newfound wealth in an age - old manner -- by trying to party more than the next guy			1
case in point : in 1814 , @entity70 's @entity69 in @entity71 constructed a brewing vat that was 22 feet tall and 60 feet in diameter , with an interior big enough to seat 200 for dinner -- which is exactly how its completion was celebrated			2
( why 200 ? because a rival had built a vat that seated 100 , of course			2
) after the dinner , the vat was filled to its 4,000 - barrel capacity			1
pretty impressive , given the grand scale of the project , but pretty unfortunate given that they overlooked a faulty supporting hoop			0
yup , the vat ruptured , causing other vats to break , and the resulting commotion was heard up to 5 miles away			2
a wall of 1.3 million gallons of dark beer washed down the street , caving in two buildings and killing nine people by means of " drowning , injury , poisoning by the porter fumes , or drunkenness			1
" the story gets even more unbelievable , though			0
rescue attempts were blocked and delayed by the thousands who flocked to the area to drink directly off the road			0
and when survivors were finally brought to the hospital , the other patients became convinced from the smell that the hospital was serving beer to every ward except theirs			2
a riot broke out , and even more people were left injured			2
sadly , this incident was not deemed tragic enough at the time to merit an annual memorial service and / or reenactment			0
@entity119 : the @entity120 ingratiate themselves to the natives in 1609 , the @entity120 sent @entity59 explorer @entity122 westward for a third attempt at finding the fabled @entity125			0
a near mutiny forced him southward , and upon reaching land , he encountered members of the @entity130 tribe			0
to foster good relations , @entity122 shared his brandy with the tribal chief , who soon passed out			0
but upon waking up the next day , he asked @entity134 to pour some more for the rest of his tribe			0
from then on , the @entity137 referred to the island as @entity139 -- literally , " the @entity140			0
" and not " high " as in " tall ; " high as in " the place where we got blotto			0
" most people would agree that @entity139 has stayed true to the spirit of its name ever since			2
the worst aftertaste in history in 1805 , @entity24 admiral @entity149 was killed during the @entity150 off the coast of @entity152			1
most sailors were simply put to rest at sea , but as an admiral , @entity149 had to be brought back to @entity59 for an official burial			1
to preserve his body during the voyage home , the second - in - command stored @entity149 's body in the ship 's vat of rum and halted all liquor rations to the crew			1
not a bad idea , but when the ship reached port , officials went to retrieve @entity149 's body and found the vat dry			1
disregarding good taste ( in every sense ) , the crew had been secretly drinking from it the entire way home			2
after that , naval rum was referred to as @entity180			2
@entity137 elephants raid the liquor cabinet no wonder they do n't sell beer at the circus			2
apparently , elephants like to get wasted			0
in fact , an outpost of the @entity137 army in the jungle region of @entity190 has been under attack ever since a local herd of elephants raided the base in search of food and discovered the soldiers ' entire winter rations of rum			2
since then , the pachyderms have regularly raided the base for a drink and have smashed down all defenses put up by the army , including electrified fences and firewalls			0
according to @entity211 , " an officer recently posted there explained that the elephants broke the rum bottles by cleverly curling their trunks around the bottom			2
then they empty the contents down their throats			0
they soon got drunk , he said , and swayed around			0
they enjoy themselves and then return to the jungle			0
" this is by no means a singular incident , though			0
the animal kingdom is well - known for its ability to identify fruit that 's begun to ferment			0
