on wednesday , @entity6 turned 18			1
on saturday she added the @entity8 slalom crown to last month 's world championships title , and on tuesday she 'll be back from @entity10 to appear on @entity12 national television			1
" hopefully i do n't trip when i 'm going on stage			0
if you knew me for longer than a day you would know that i spill things and i break things and i trip a lot			0
you would not think i 'd be good at slalom			2
" but she 's so good that she denied the world 's best female skier this season yet another accolade at the finale in @entity24 , @entity25			1
@entity26 had been poised to add the slalom title to her overall , giant slalom and @entity29 , having been denied the downhill when fog canceled racing on @entity6 's birthday			1
the @entity33 was the fastest on the opening run , and led the standings by seven points , but @entity6 made up a 1.17 - second deficit to claim her fourth @entity8 race this season and become the fourth youngest woman to win the title			1
she is only the third non-european to win the slalom globe , following compatriot @entity43 in 1984 and @entity45 @entity44 in 1971			2
no other @entity47 woman has won four @entity8 races in a season			1
" i was freaking out , this time there was really too much emotion , " said @entity6 , who last month in @entity50 was the youngest winner of the slalom title at a world championships since 1974			1
" i think half of this globe belongs to someone else today			0
i actually would like to thank @entity26			2
she 's been inspiring , she 's helped me get to where i am			0
" she 's also had strong support from her parents and coaching staff			0
" after the first run i went directly to our athlete tent and just tried to sit quietly and figure out what i needed to do to make it better , " @entity6 said			1
" it 's hard to do that between runs in a race , but my mom helped , my coaches helped , my dad helped , everybody			0
they all just said the same thing , ' you have to let it go			0
you can not hold back			0
there is nothing to lose			0
' so i tried to do that			0
" @entity26 had to settle for third place behind @entity50 's @entity82 for her 23rd podium finish this season			1
" in the first run i risked a lot and somehow in the second i did n't manage to risk as much , " the 29 - year - old said			2
" @entity6 has been dominating slalom the whole season and i do n't think i lost the globe here today , but somewhere else			1
" @entity26 has already wrapped up the giant slalom globe ahead of sunday 's final race -- and @entity12 @entity93 confirmed his dominance of the men 's discipline when he crowned his season with a sixth victory out of eight starts on saturday			1
" it 's so ridiculous , it has been such an amazing year , " said @entity93 , who won three golds at the world championships and sealed the giant slalom globe last weekend with victory in @entity33			1
" i never would have expected it and in a way it 's kind of a bummer as i will never be able to do that again			0
a really cool season and to finish it up with a victory			2
i could n't be more pleased			0
" overall @entity8 champion @entity111 was second to be giant slalom runnerup , and has already clinched the slalom title ahead of sunday 's final race			1
" i can not sleep			0
my head is so full , i keep thinking and thinking and trying to digest it all , " the @entity50 said			0
" so much has happened this season and i have not had any time to get into terms with it			2
