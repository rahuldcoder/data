-- over the past two years the @entity2 's press freedom ranking has declined			1
in the @entity3 ( @entity5 ) index , the @entity2 ranked 28th out of 179 countries , and in the 2013 index the country went down a point ranking at 29 out of 179 countries			0
the @entity2 prides itself on being a country with a long heritage of upholding the rights of individuals accompanied by a free and strong press			1
the @entity2 government is a @entity18 member of the @entity19 , a leading country in the @entity21 , @entity22 , and the @entity23 , and uses its influence to advocate for human rights to be respected globally			1
two years ago , the @entity27 phone hacking scandal shook the institutional confidence of the @entity2 media to its core			1
the @entity2 's innate belief of the right to a free and strong press betrayed the innate respect of the same national belief -- the rights of individuals			1
the conclusions found in the lord judge @entity38 cemented this scandal as not only unprecedented but raised the question , for the first time ever , if legislation was needed to regulate the @entity2 press ? @entity44 : @entity45 filed in @entity2 over @entity47 's detention much debate led to the draft @entity50 for @entity2 @entity51			1
the draft document outlines how the @entity2 should devise a self - regulatory body within its longstanding history of media freedom			2
the @entity2 is now faced with yet another situation that has shocked the international community and shaken the country 's press freedom identity for a second time -- the detention of @entity62 ( assisting his partner , @entity64 journalist @entity44 )			1
the @entity44 / @entity47 case , however , flies in the face of the argument of @entity2 press self - regulation and raises great concern over terrorism laws , investigative journalism and the protection of journalists ' sources			1
the question remains , however , does the @entity2 's press freedom ranking reflect the debate now ensuing the country on @entity2 press regulation and now the protection of journalists sources , or is there more to the methodology of the @entity2 ranking than meets the eye ? in other words , can the @entity2 improve its ranking ? the research is based on a two tiered system : in - house research and a questionnaire sent to press freedom experts and journalists			2
@entity5 's research for the @entity2 's 2013 ranking focused on areas of concern such as , the [ then ] libel laws ( which had been reformed after the publication of the 2013 index ) , the draft @entity99 , which had been rejected but is now under reconsideration and , lastly , elements of the @entity2 anti-terror laws			0
@entity2 based @entity106 published a report which outlines the three problematic " themes " found in @entity2 anti-terror laws : " the broad definition of terrorism , the use of anti-terror laws to stifle legitimate social and political protest and the new prohibitions on the encouragement , other inducement or glorification of terrorism			0
" @entity5 has found that a significant factor in index ranking methodology is that index rankings should not be taken as an indication of the quality of the media in the countries concerned			0
such a concept brings the discussion to the heart of the matter within the @entity2			0
how can the @entity2 , with the established fundamental freedoms of a democratic society , government , parliament , judiciary and media not rank in the top echelon of press freedom indexes ? when examining countries that score within the top echelon in the @entity5 and @entity144 press freedom indexes , a number of the countries do have press self - regulatory bodies underpinned by statute			1
@entity47 ' afraid ' during questioning media regulation within historically and fundamentally democratic nations does not necessarily equate to a lack of press freedom in countries which rank in the top echelon on press freedom indexes and have self - regulatory bodies underpinned by statutes			0
self - regulatory press systems , however , might not be applied as successfully in countries that do not have deeply rooted democratic traditions and systems in place , and do not meet all international standards of human rights			0
the issue is wider and more complex than the notion of one glove fits all			0
is such a system right for the @entity2 with a deeply rooted tradition of good governance and democratic values compared to other like - minded western countries that have press self - regulatory bodies , underpinned by statute , and rank higher than the @entity2 in press freedom indexes ? professor @entity177 , director of research at the @entity179 at @entity180 states : " indexes are not a perfect science ; many smaller @entity184 countries are more open and transparent [ @entity185 and @entity186 , for example ] as opposed to larger @entity184 countries , particularly those larger @entity184 countries that lead in international intervention			2
western countries that lead in international intervention will not be as transparent with official documents and operations , as @entity184 countries which do not lead on international intervention , due to security reasons and because of confidential relationships with foreign governments			0
for example , in @entity185 , almost all official and political documents can be viewed by the public on or off line -- even the @entity185 president 's telephone number can be found in the phone book			0
" professor @entity177 concluded : " with this in mind , countries like the @entity2 will most likely never be number one in press freedom rankings , unless the county 's entire political , economic and international stance changes drastically , making the @entity2 a country that does not lead on international intervention			2
" some research has found that a country having a press self - regulatory body underpinned by statute does not always mean that the quality of the media within the country suffers , if the country has strong standing democratic traditions of good governance , independent judiciary , and upholds international standards for all human rights			2
in the wake of the @entity44 / @entity47 case , the @entity2 must examine that the legal frameworks in place to protect its citizens from terrorism , has intelligent checks and balances that allow for the free flow of investigative journalism and information that is published for the same national interest			1
upon publication of the @entity38 report , @entity5 pointed out , however , that non-regulation , especially for a country that sets the precedent with longstanding respect and tradition of press freedom , is always the most advantageous , and in some circumstances , the best choice			0
as pointed out in @entity257 's report , " @entity254 in @entity255 , " @entity252 , editor of the @entity253 observed : " the phone - hacking scandal has put investigative journalism in the dock , and it was [ @entity2 ] investigative journalism that put it there			0
" in regards to the @entity44 / @entity47 case -- if you silence the media , you silence informed citizenry ; without informed citizens freedom of information , freedom of any kind , can be greatly compromised			1

@entity62 , partner of journalist @entity44 , was detained at @entity280
@entity44 broke news of secret @entity284 *surveillance* *programs* in the @entity64
@entity2 prides itself on upholding rights of individuals and free press , writes @entity289
if you silence the media , you silence informed citizenry , she says
