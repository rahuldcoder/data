-- @entity1 , we 've never met but i , too , spent a decade or so in private equity , made some money and moved on to other things while retaining ties to many people in the industry ( including some of your former colleagues at @entity12 )			1
so , it pains me to see you trying to win despite your private equity background rather than because of it			1
although your interview with @entity17 was a baby step in the right direction , you still need to stop pussy - footing around about when you did ( or did not ) leave @entity21 , or whether you will ( or will not ) release your tax returns			2
be a man and make an honest case for why you should be the first private - equity president ! here 's what you should say : " like most private equity guys , i was a white , male , something - cum - laude , @entity29 - type who spent my early career in management consulting and @entity34 before getting into the business , where i quickly made some serious money			1
" unlike my cousin @entity37 and his friends who work in @entity39 , i was not a venture capitalist who made my money starting companies or inventing things			1
unlike mayor @entity45 , i was not an entrepreneur who made my money building a company			2
unlike folksy @entity48 , i was not a long - term investor who made my money from owning companies			2
and unlike my younger brother @entity52 , i did n't make my money because i was really , really smart			2
( @entity52 was a physics professor before starting his fund and still plays chess at a high level but he 's too weird to be president			2
) " no , i made most of my money from buying and selling a dozen or so companies with other people 's money ; mostly uninteresting mid-sized companies that nobody particularly wanted ; and i got to keep 20 % of the difference between the purchase and sale price plus any cash i could take out while i owned them			2
" and i now recognize that this short - term buying and selling made me about as knowledgeable about business as @entity70 was about playing baseball			2
i was an expert at telling business people how to do what i 'd never done myself			0
and to tell you the truth , back when i was in private equity most ' real ' businessmen -- the people running our largest companies and the entrepreneurs starting new businesses -- had about as much respect for money guys like me as @entity84 had for @entity70 -- close to zero			1
" but despite the bashing it has taken in the press , i 'm proud of our private equity system			1
it plays the vital role of flowing ' risk money ' from large investors , mostly large pension funds and the wealthy , into situations where it can be put to good use			1
money that allows companies to pursue activities that , while potentially rewarding , involve taking technology , market and operational risks			0
" our country needs investment to create economic growth , improve living standards and increase productivity			0
risk money is particularly important not only because of its direct benefits -- profits for successful companies , new and improved products , employment and knowledge -- but also because it gives individuals and institutions the opportunity to exercise their rights to buy , to sell and to pursue their dreams			0
" and only independent organizations like @entity21 have proven able to get the job done because the other candidates for doing the job -- government , angels , banks -- have proven too stupid , too lazy , too small or too bureaucratic			0
" unfortunately everything worth doing can be overdone and sometimes i went from taking risks that were already there to making risks that were n't			0
why ? because the company i wanted to buy was too boring , too well run , or too expensive to give me a decent chance of making real money unless i increased the level of risk			1
and this risk , usually excessive borrowing that i forced the company to take on ( usually so that i could buy it ) was borne by the company and its employees , customers and vendors with occasionally dire consequences			0
" i 'm sick to death of making lame excuses -- ' it 's all part of creative destruction , ' ' the market made me do it , ' ' bankruptcy is no big deal , ' ' i 'd already left @entity21 when it happened ' -- i admit it and , as i told @entity17 , i felt terrible when a business failed , but risk - making was a small part of what i did			0
" while experts disagree about whether i created any lasting value , there is no doubt that i extracted it wherever possible			0
private equity guys are always on the lookout for opportunities to extract value from customers ( can we charge more for less ? ) , from vendors ( can we pay them later ? ) , from employees ( can we outsource to @entity170 ! ) , from sellers ( can we partner up in the next auction ? ) and from buyers ( can we push the accountants harder ? )			1
" extraction probably makes things more efficient , and i got to my keep 20 % of the extract , but it can be a nasty business			1
" i worked hard and am pretty talented , but a large part of how i got so rich was just the dumb luck of joining an industry that was an almost perfectly designed money machine during what turned out to be a 20 - year bull run			0
" the funds are so large ( per person ) that even mediocre performance supports big paydays as profits are shared by very few people ; the widespread use of borrowed money leads to cycle - driven windfalls even when no value is created over time , and i helped make a lot of other people rich , too , since i created a steady stream of corporate transactions ( purchases , sales , mergers , refinancings and restructurings ) that generated enormous fees for the bankers , lawyers and consultants for whom private equity is the gift that keeps on giving			1
" in private equity , i was surrounded by guys just like me and this can still make it hard for me to relate to regular people			1
i almost never dealt with women or minorities as true partners			0
and i 'm still perplexed when people do n't share my passion for money , efficiency and numbers			0
" weirdly , i do n't even feel like i 'm in the top .1 % given that so many of my friends have a lot more money than me			0
( that 's why i find it so hard to shake my politically suicidal resistance to closing the ' carried interest ' tax loophole that has already allowed me and my friends to pocket billions in tax - advantaged compensation			0
) " one last thing you probably already know : i was n't very nice			0
i always acted in my own economic interest , i quantified everything , i thought creatively about what could be done ( not what should ) , i treated people as means not ends , and i regularly did to others what i would never want done to myself , my friends or my family			0
you 'll have to ask the secretaries , middle managers , nannies and limo drivers what kind of man i really was or how i compared to the other effortlessly superior hotshots who roamed private equity 's hallowed halls			1
but i did some things i 'm now ashamed of ( the picture with dollars overflowing my pockets ) and i still have the habit of saying things i probably should n't - ' let 's make a $ 10,000 bet , ' ' i enjoy firing people ' and ' i 'm not concerned about the very poor			1
' " on the other hand , i left the private equity world a long time ago and have since done some pretty cool and impressive things -- like running the @entity265 and being the governor of @entity267 -- but my time in the industry remains important because i saw first - hand the worst of debt - induced risk making ( rather than risk taking ) , how the unfettered market tends toward unsustainably large ( and morally reprehensible ) extremes of wealth and poverty , how globalization offers us both opportunities and threats , and that the perverse incentives in our winner - take - all financial system can lead individually rational people to make collectively insane decisions			1
but i also know how markets work and that they have no equal as the core organizing principle for our society			0
" so as president i will be ideally positioned to do the obvious things that our country needs to get back on track -- like pass the @entity292 , close the carried - interest tax loophole , impose a small tax on corporate transactions with the proceeds used to fund oversight of the financial system and limit the tax - deductibility of acquisition - related debt -- without throwing the capitalist baby out with the bathwater			2
" and as a rich businessman , i will have the moral authority to increase taxes on the wealthy in our time of national need while ignoring the shrieks of those who , either out of ignorance or malevolent self - interest , will make baseless claims about the adverse effects on jobs and growth			1
" @entity1 , i appreciate that it 's tough in the time of super pacs to say what you really think when there is so much hard - right money for the taking			0
and i guess you still have the option to @entity326 after the election if you win			0
but you 're our best hope to be a private equity president ( is @entity330 running any time soon ? @entity329 ? think about it , you may be our only hope			1
) and in the last few weeks it has become clear that by pretending to be something that you 're not , you run the risk of going down in flames while tarnishing an industry that 's been good to you			2
i know you 're a centrist at heart ; please come out of the closet ! yours sincerely , @entity339 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity342 .			1

former private equity *executive* @entity342 has advice for @entity345
he says @entity345 should give a full account of the good and bad things he did at @entity12
@entity345 should explain why , despite *weaknesses* , private equity experience was valuable
@entity353 : @entity345 should commit to eliminate loopholes , raise taxes on wealthy
