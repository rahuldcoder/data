-- a collapse on the penultimate tee of the @entity3 by @entity4 allowed @entity5 to win the $ 1.7 million tournament for the second time in his career			1
@entity8 's @entity4 looked to be heading into a playoff with world @entity10 before hitting two tee shots into the water at the 17th hole to throw away any chance he had of winning the title he picked up in 2008			1
a war of words between the two players broke out on saturday when @entity4 blamed @entity20 for crowd noise which he claimed distracted him during his swing			2
it led to @entity4 describing @entity20 as " not the nicest guy on tour " , but the @entity26 had the last laugh as a final round of 70 saw him finish top of the leaderboard on 13 - under par , six strokes ahead of the @entity33			1
" it sounds like i was the bad guy here , " @entity4 told the @entity25 's official website			1
" i was the victim			0
i do n't have any regrets of anything			0
" that hole has been good to me for the most part , " @entity4 said of the 17th after carding a final round of 76			1
" today , it was n't			0
that 's the way it is			0
that 's the kind of hole it is			2
you 've got to love it for what it is			0
" it 's always nice to have a chance at beating the no. 1 player in the world , but unfortunately for me , i was n't able to this week			0
" for @entity20 it was a fourth tournament win of the year , one which moved him onto 78 @entity25 wins , four off @entity62 's record of 82			1
" we just go out there and play , " said @entity5 , who won the @entity63 for the first time in 2001 and took his earnings for 2013 to over $ 5.8m from just seven tournaments			1
" i had an opportunity to win the golf tournament when i was tied for the lead , and i thought i handled the situation well and really played well when i really needed to			0
and that 's something i 'm excited about it			0
" @entity75 's @entity74 , playing alongside @entity4 , missed a birdie putt on the 17th which would have seen him pull level with @entity20			1
in the end @entity74 ( 72 ) finished 11 under in a three - way tie for second with @entity26 duo @entity82 ( 67 ) and @entity83 ( 70 )			2
@entity4 was part of a seven - strong group on seven under which also included two - time major winner @entity86 and former world no. 1 @entity87 .			2

@entity5 wins the @entity3 after collapse from @entity4
@entity4 hit two tee shots into the water at the 17th hole , ending his *challenge*
@entity96 wins the event for the first time since 2001
the @entity26 is now just four wins off @entity62 's record of 82 @entity25 victories
