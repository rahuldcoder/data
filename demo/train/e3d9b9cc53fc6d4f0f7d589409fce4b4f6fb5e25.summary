this week it was reported that @entity1 , the ceo and cofounder of @entity3 , underwent a liver transplant two months ago			1
one detail concerning @entity1 's transplant seemed odd : the surgery took place at a hospital in @entity10 , some 2,000 miles from @entity1 ' home in northern @entity12			1
why @entity10 ? @entity1 ( pictured in october 2008 ) has been on a health - related leave of absence since january 2009			1
the answer sheds light on the intricacies of the organ transplant system , as well as why it 's sometimes easier for people with significant financial resources to get an organ transplant			1
( @entity1 ' estimated net worth : $ 5.7 billion			1
) livers are a scarce resource			0
in any given year , only about one - third of the people on the national transplant waiting list receive one , and as of late june , more than 16,000 people were on the list			1
yet it sometimes seems that celebrities in need end up at the front of the line when they need a transplant , and people often assume they get preferential treatment			1
( rumors about special treatment circulated after baseball player @entity41 's liver transplant in 1995 , for example			1
) @entity43 : the real gift of life : how medical donations help the truth is more complicated			0
no one can actually buy an organ in the @entity49 ( legally , that is )			0
but getting a liver transplant , it turns out , is a lot like getting into college			2
once you 're on the waiting list , your chances of getting off it depend largely on your personal circumstances -- how sick you are and whether you are a good donor match			1
but getting on the list in the first place -- or on more than one list , as the case may be -- requires resources and know - how that most people do n't have			1
can some people ' cut the line ' ? there are 127 centers in the @entity49 that perform liver transplants			2
if you need an organ transplant , your doctor will refer you to one of these centers , where you will be evaluated , given a score based on the severity of illness , and placed on the center 's waiting list , if you are indeed a candidate for transplant			1
the center 's waiting list feeds into a national database managed by the @entity84 ( @entity84 ) , a nonprofit organization that contracts with the federal government to manage the nation 's organ transplant system			1
@entity84 works with 58 organ procurement organizations ( @entity88 ) that coordinate organ distribution in their region of the country			0
when an organ becomes available , the @entity88 in that region searches the @entity84 database for a local match using blood type ( and other biological considerations ) , the patient 's severity score , and the time spent on the waiting list			1
if a match ca n't be made within that region , the organization expands its search to neighboring regions			2
the problem -- or the advantage for some patients -- is that not all @entity88 are created equal			0
some regions contain nearly 15 times as many people as others , and their waiting list times vary widely			1
patients in the smaller opos tend to be less sick and experience shorter wait times before getting an organ			1
in the @entity88 where @entity1 received his transplant , the median wait for a liver between 2002 and 2007 was just over four months			1
the national average was just over a year , and in some @entity88 it was more than three years			2
though there is always the possibility of preferential treatment once a patient is on a waiting list -- @entity84 conducts periodic audits of transplant centers for exactly this reason -- it is unlikely that someone like @entity1 can " cut the line " of the transplant waiting list			1
@entity43 : three sisters find kidney donor for dad using craigslist the reason that some people might be able to get transplants more quickly is that they 're standing in more lines			2
nothing prevents someone from being evaluated and listed at multiple transplant centers			2
as long as a patient has the wherewithal to fly around the country -- and be available at the drop of a hat if a liver becomes available ( this is where the private jet comes in handy ) -- a patient can , in theory , be evaluated by all the transplant centers in the country			2
" the system works at two levels , " explains @entity158 , @entity159 , the chair of the department of medical ethics at the @entity162			2
" one , who gets in to a center			0
two , who gets transplanted off a particular center 's list when an organ becomes available			2
most of the attention goes to stage two , but the biggest ethical challenges are really at stage one			0
" @entity1 underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer in 2004			1
( he reportedly had a type that grows more slowly -- and has a better prognosis -- than others			0
) he was said to have recovered , but last year he appeared in public looking thin and sick			0
he took a leave of absence in january and underwent a liver transplant a few months later			2
however , it 's not clear how long he was on the transplant waiting list , or whether he was on the waiting list for a center other than the one in @entity10			1
insurance matters too since 2003 , @entity84 has required that transplant centers inform all candidates that they can be evaluated and listed at more than one center , and that they can also transfer their care from one center to another without losing the time they have accrued on the waiting list			1
however , not everyone can afford to fly around the country and be evaluated at more than one transplant center			0
in fact , many people ca n't afford a liver transplant , period			1
according to the most recent estimates , the cost of a liver transplant is $ 519,600 -- a price tag that excludes roughly one - third of @entity49 because they do n't have sufficient insurance ( or any insurance ) , @entity158 estimates			1
according to data collected for @entity84 , only about 5 percent of liver transplants are paid for out of pocket			0
@entity43 : where the money goes : a breast cancer donation guide " what your insurance covers is very different from everyone else 's , " says @entity216 , a spokesperson for @entity84			0
some insurance companies wo n't cover evaluations at multiple transplant centers , @entity216 explains , and in at least one case , an insurance company has restricted its coverage to a single transplant center that the company itself owned			0
moreover , your insurance continues to be important during the evaluation process			0
the decision to accept a transplant candidate takes place before @entity84 enters the picture , and the committees that determine whether a patient is added to the transplant center 's waiting list have access to a patient 's full medical and financial history			1
" there 's a huge triage involved in getting in , " says @entity158			0
" if you 're a homeless alcoholic sleeping on the streets of @entity244 , and you 're going toe - to - toe with @entity1 , you 're going to lose			1
" for most people , the ability to pay is a precondition for acceptance at more than one transplant center			2
wealthy people who are , in effect , financially " pre-approved " for a liver transplant , can shop around and identify the transplant centers that will give them the best chance of receiving a new organ			1
reforming the system despite the apparent problems with the transplant system , past efforts at reform have generally failed			2
@entity43 : could painkillers be hurting your heart ? in the late 1990s , the @entity49 @entity265 issued new regulations that would have given priority to the sickest patients , regardless of region			0
this would have eliminated the geographic disparities that make approval at multiple transplant centers advantageous , but @entity274 blocked the regulations and instead asked the @entity275 , an advisory organization that belongs to the @entity276 , to consider the issue			0
the @entity275 's proposal was less far - reaching , but it did recommend standardizing the size of the organ donor pool for the sickest patients			0
@entity274 failed to implement this measure as well , however			0
some transplant centers advocated the shift away from the @entity88 system , but others vigorously lobbied @entity274 to oppose the new policy			2
the smaller transplant centers were concerned that in a national organ allocation system , they would receive fewer transplants and be driven out of business			2
the larger transplant centers , meanwhile , wanted to maintain the size and geographical reach of the @entity88 in their areas			0
" there was a huge split in the transplant community , " says @entity216			0
" it was very territorial at the time , and there was a lot of maneuvering going on			0
there were a lot of business interests on the part of the transplant centers			0
" @entity84 itself has been split on the issue of multiple listing			0
the organization 's board of directors has voted on whether to restrict multiple listing three times in the past 15 years ; the first vote resulted in a tie , and in the others the proposal was rejected by a divided vote			0
the inequity revealed in the liver transplant process is symptomatic of the larger inequalities in the @entity49 health - care system , says @entity158 , who also cochairs a @entity324 task force on organ trafficking			1
in countries such as @entity329 or @entity330 that have national health - care systems , a patient 's finances do n't influence access to organs to the same extent , he says			0
" money does n't play such a big role in entry into the system , " he says			0
" @entity1 ' transplant is relevant to why we need some health reform			1

@entity3 cofounder @entity1 is recovering from transplant surgery in @entity10
his surgery raises *questions* about preferential treatment
current system results in regions with much shorter wait times than others
16,000 people on the liver waiting list ; in any one year only one - third get liver
