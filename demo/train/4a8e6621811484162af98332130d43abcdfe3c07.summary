@entity0 -- federal aviation authorities say they are investigating a string of events that began monday when a pilot spilled coffee on a cockpit panel , leading to a false hijack warning and culminating in the plane 's emergency landing in @entity11			1
at issue : did @entity13 warn pilots not to hold beverages over the plane 's electronics - laden console ? the incident occurred on @entity19 , a @entity20 777 - 200 headed from @entity21 to @entity22 , @entity23			1
according to @entity11 transportation officials , the pilot spilled coffee on the aircraft 's radio equipment , located on the center console of the cockpit			1
the crew advised controllers they had communication problems and subsequently reported they were experiencing navigation problems , the officials said			0
a @entity13 spokesman confirmed that a crew member 's beverage spilled " during a period of light turbulence , " but said the pilot remained in contact with air traffic control and followed standard operating procedures			1
a source familiar with the incident told @entity1 that after the pilot switched to a backup radio system , the plane briefly sent out a transponder signal indicating it had been hijacked			1
the source declined to explain how that happened			2
but pilots contacted by @entity1 said the signal could have been sent if one of the pilots inadvertently hit the transponder knob while cleaning up the spill			1
or , they said , it could have happened if the pilot had tried to send a different transponder code indicating the plane had communication problems			2
the pilot made the decision to make an emergency landing in @entity67 rather than continue the trans - oceanic flight , officials said			2
@entity70 officials said wednesday that pilots are allowed to have beverages in the cockpit , noting that many aircraft cockpits have cup holders			1
but they pointed to a rule prohibiting pilots from " any activity ... such as eating meals " that could distract them during a " critical phase of flight , " typically meaning takeoffs and landings			0
drinking coffee could be construed as " eating meals , " according to @entity70 spokesman @entity84			1
the agency 's @entity85 will investigate whether @entity13 has a policy prohibiting crew members from passing liquids over , or placing them on , the console , and whether they 've communicated that policy to pilots			2
the @entity70 also will investigate whether the spilled liquid in fact caused the communications problem , or if there were other factors , @entity84 said			1
as unlikely as a coffee spill accident may seem , a similar scenario formed the basis of a 1964 movie , " @entity97			0
" in that film , a cup of coffee spills on the plane 's center console , leaking into the electronics			0
the leak leads to a series of events culminating in the plane 's crash			0
the movie , coincidentally , aired sunday night on @entity114 , the night before the @entity13 mishap			1
@entity116 , a former b - 777 pilot , said a spilled drink is not likely to bring down a plane , pointing to redundant systems in aircraft			2
but he said it was reasonable for the pilot to land the plane			0
@entity116 , who works for @entity124 , a consulting company , said liquids should not be banned from cockpits			0
" particularly on the long flights , you have to have water constantly , you have to continually hydrate your body , otherwise you run into other physiological problems , " he said			0
the @entity132 said it does not plan on investigating the mishap			0
" it does not appear that this incident warrants an @entity132 investigation , " spokesman @entity134 said			0
@entity132 records do not show any incidents where spilled substances were a factor in a crash , he said			0
@entity1 's @entity143 and @entity144 contributed to this report .			2

@entity70 investigates policies about food , drink in the cockpit , source tells @entity1
incident monday night stemmed from coffee spilled on a cockpit panel
somehow an emergency signal indicating a hijacking was *triggered*
the @entity13 flight was en route from @entity21 to @entity22 , @entity23
