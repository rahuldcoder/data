-- the news of @entity3 's death sunday morning caught me by surprise , but it was hardly surprising			1
when i last talked to the @entity8 playwright , politician and statesman was in march , at a party to celebrate the @entity13 premiere of a movie he 'd directed of his final play , " @entity17			0
" he was already very frail			0
ever since 1996 , when he lost half a lung to cancer after a lifetime of heavy smoking , he had seemed to be living on borrowed time			2
he 'd been in the hospital several times since then , and had one or two near - death experiences , but he always managed to bounce back , and i was n't alone in thinking he might be practically invincible			0
in march , i was on my way to @entity28 to take a closer look at the @entity30 , and i wanted @entity3 's permission to try to find someone in @entity33 to translate his most influential essay -- 1978 's " @entity34 , " about non-violent opposition to tyranny -- into @entity37			1
that essay had inspired the creation of the @entity41 trade union in @entity42 , and continues to give strength to dissidents in @entity45 , @entity46 , and @entity47 who are longing for peaceful change			1
i thought some @entity50 readers might find it useful as well			2
before the premiere , @entity3 had been in the hospital yet again , but here he was now , sitting on a couch , a plaid scarf around his neck , sipping a glass of wine and working his way through what seemed like an endless line of people wanting to wish him well			1
he seemed small , a shadow of the man who , in his prime , could talk to kings and presidents and rock stars and command a world stage			0
when my turn came , i sat down beside him , congratulated him on the movie -- his first ( and now only ) foray into that medium -- and then put the question to him			0
his voice was so low i had to lean in close to hear him			0
he gave me his blessing , and then said , " but do you think the @entity50 are ready for democracy ? " his question caught me off guard , but i finally managed a reply : " i have no idea , but @entity87 , were you guys ready for democracy back in 1989 ? " he smiled , and said , " i see your point			2
" the most amazing thing about those 1989 revolutions was not just how quickly they unfolded , but how much sheer improvisation went on			0
@entity3 led an ad - hoc group called the @entity96 that , within ten short days , managed to negotiate the communist party out of power			1
they had no real idea what they were doing , and there were no guarantees about the outcome			0
on the other hand , you could argue that @entity3 's entire life -- and the life of his peers -- had been one long preparation for that moment			1
@entity3 , who died peacefully sunday morning in his country home in north - east @entity115 , leaves behind so many legacies it 's hard to know where to begin			1
in the 1950s , he was an experimental poet ; in the 1960s , a master essayist , radical playwright and feisty magazine editor ; in the 1970s , an underground publisher , human rights activist , and ultimately a prisoner			0
and -- perhaps holding it all together -- he was a bon - viveur who loved wine and company and could bring people together in an atmosphere of camaraderie and good cheer			1
he brought all these qualities into the @entity136 as president , first of @entity139 and then , after the country broke up in 1993 , of the @entity8			0
he also remained , paradoxically , a very shy and gentle man with a will of steel , who was fearless when confronting a regime that tried , relentlessly , to crush his spirit , and who , to the very end of his tenure in office , suffered from stage - fright each time he had to entertain a head of state , or speak in public			1
above all , he was an intellectual who believed that words were not enough			0
a favorite saying of his was , " having posited a , i must therefore posit @entity154 " by that he meant that if you have ideas about how to change the status quo , you have an obligation to muck in and help bring that change about			1
one of the most important turning points in his long career came back in the mid- 1970s when he joined forces with @entity164 , the leading figure in a musical underground that challenged the regime 's cultural totalitarianism at its very core			1
when the @entity172 , the rock band @entity171 was managing ( and for whom i played for a while ) were arrested in 1976 , @entity3 and his companions sprang to their defense			2
i believe it was at this point that @entity3 became a true " dissident , " as the late @entity180 defined the term : someone who is willing to put his own comfort and safety at serious risk for the sake of his ideas			1
@entity3 's defense of the musical underground morphed into the human rights movement called @entity190 , and a related organization , @entity191 to defend the unjustly prosecuted			1
the regime shucked its kid gloves , and @entity3 spent over four years in prison , and suffered many more years of intrusive police surveillance			1
he was not alone , of course , but his example made it easier for others to follow			0
his treatment by the regime permanently undermined his health , but his resistance also provided inspiration for a new generation of dissenters that came to fore in 1989			0
during the @entity210 , on december 7 , 1989 , in the fabled @entity208 where @entity3 and the @entity96 had their headquarters , he was asked by a journalist what political lessons he had learned in his years as a dissident			2
" i 'd have to think about it , " @entity3 replied , " but there 's one lesson i could mention right now			2
when you try to act in accordance with your conscience , when you try to speak the truth , when you try to behave like a citizen , even in conditions where citizenship is degraded , it wo n't necessarily lead anywhere , but it might			0
there 's one thing , however , that will never lead anywhere , and that is speculating that your behavior will have a specific outcome			0
" i did eventually find an @entity37 translator for @entity3 's essay , and it will be coming out in an anthology of his work to be published in @entity33 sometime next year			1
it wo n't necessarily lead anywhere , but then again , you never know			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity242 .			2

a long - time friend of @entity3 's remembers him as fearless against the regime
@entity3 loved wine and company and could bring people together , @entity242 recalls
he believed that if you have ideas for change , you must help bring that change about
he continues to inspire activists in @entity46 , @entity45 and now the @entity50 world
