@entity12 added that she admired @entity2 for having the courage to compete in the pageant			1
in a @entity1 interview hours before showtime , the 6 - foot - 1 @entity2 seemed a bit weary , as the spotlight was still squarely on her gender transformation			1
from beauty pageants to college sports , transgender people break barriers " like i always say , my family did n't understand , so why would i expect anybody else to understand ? and then they got to know me and they loved me , " @entity2 said			1
but on sunday , she told @entity1 the pageant was " an amazing experience			1
" asked if she thought her transgender status affected the judges ' decision , she said , " who 's to say ? i think i worked very hard			2
all of us ladies worked so hard and we gave it our best shot			2

she began hormone therapy as a teenager and had gender reassignment surgery four years ago , when she was 19			0
it was then she pursued her dream of competing in a pageant			2
but her gender history meant she was disqualified from the @entity5 competition for not being a " natural born woman			1
