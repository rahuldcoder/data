-- remember the @entity1 and @entity2 ? they 'll be getting some feature and style upgrades , as well as some price - slashing , in the near future			1
although the @entity10 were largely overshadowed by tuesday 's @entity12 news , @entity9 ceo @entity8 also announced a handful of tweaks to @entity9 's iconic music - player line -- in plenty of time , of course , for the holiday shopping season			1
the new @entity2 , now the most popular @entity2 , will be available in both black and white and get a $ 30 price cut , to $ 199 for @entity21 of storage , $ 299 for 32 gigs and $ 399 for 64			0
it will also run @entity9 's new @entity26 operating system , meaning its ability to run apps , surf the @entity29 and the like will maintain its unofficial status as the @entity12 - without - a - phone			1
the new @entity2 ships on october 12			0
the @entity34 , perhaps appropriately , is getting an even smaller update			2
the most fun change will be @entity9 's addition of 16 new clock faces for folks who use the tiny player 's 1.5 - inch screen as a watch			1
our favorite ? the iconic @entity46 watch is now available , with @entity46 's hands spinning around to tell the time			1
it 's also getting a price cut , down to $ 129 for the @entity21 version and $ 149 for @entity52			0
the runt of the litter , the @entity34 , goes for a mere $ 49			0
( virtually free by @entity9 's standards , if still more expensive than some rival mp3 players with the same limited storage space )			0
totally lost in the shuffle ( see what we did there ? ) was any mention at all of the @entity63 or ... shuffle			0
the two did n't get a single mention at tuesday 's event , just as they were left out in the cold at last year 's @entity2 event			0
that 's led to lots of stories in the tech press speculating that the clock is ticking toward the demise of the two venerable players			0
( you know ... even if this one , from @entity78 , was dead wrong )			0
but @entity9 's online store wednesday showed both devices still for sale			2
it 's clear @entity9 wants to move completely to touchscreen and abandon the old - fashioned click wheel on the @entity86 ( the @entity34 's click wheel disappeared last year )			1
time will tell how long the older devices last , although for our money there 's still something to be said for the top - of - the - line @entity86 , with its massive 160 gigabytes of storage , as a repository for folks ' entire music collection			2
music and other media content got another boost tuesday with @entity9 announcing plans that could move @entity102 into the cloud			2
the @entity105 service will now be integrated into the @entity26 operating system			1
it will work with apps and allow content to be stored on remote servers instead of the users ' @entity2 , @entity12 or other device			1
each device will get @entity114 of free storage , according to @entity8			0
working with @entity102 , the cloud - based service would let a user access their music , videos and the like from any @entity9 device running @entity26 .			1

ipods , while overshadowed by the @entity12 , got *freshened* up by @entity9
the @entity1 and touch both saw price cuts
@entity9 *unveiled* 16 new " clock faces " for the @entity34 -- *including* the time - honored @entity46
@entity105 will integrate with new operating system , let users store music , videos on remote servers
