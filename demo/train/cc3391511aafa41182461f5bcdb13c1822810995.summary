the misery is too widespread			1
the privileged are too brazen			1
on @entity6 , young students have created a free democratic space in a place they call @entity9			1
they protest that @entity6 has been rescued , but there is no help for most @entity12			1
in a moving statement , they presented their view : " we are the 99 %			1
we are getting kicked out of our homes			1
we are forced to choose between groceries and rent			1
we are denied quality medical care			1
we are suffering from environmental pollution			1
we are working long hours for little pay and no rights , if we are working at all			1
we are getting nothing while the other 1 percent is getting everything			2
we are the 99 %			2
" their demonstrators were scorned in the beginning			2
they had no clear demands			2
they were organized with no formal structure			2
they were squatting out in the rain , not allowed tents or bedding			2
but they understood the value of nonviolence			2
in the face of pepper spray and police provocation , they stayed disciplined			2
as they were being dragged away to be arrested , they said to the police : " we are the 99 %			2
we are fighting for your pensions			2
you should stand with us			2
" they made no demands but their analysis was dead on			2
the wealthiest few are capturing all the rewards of growth in this society , while the large majority falls behind			2
@entity6 got bailed out , rescued without being reorganized , while homeowners were left to fend for themselves			1
inequality has reached levels not seen since before the @entity57			2
with this kind of inequality -- with the top 1 % having as much income as the bottom 60 % , according to the @entity61 -- the economy does n't work well			0
the rich turn to speculation			1
now conservatives are talking about sending the bill for @entity6 's excesses to the most vulnerable -- cutting @entity69 and @entity70 , slashing spending on public education			1
many of the kids in @entity74 are graduating from college with thousands in college debt and no jobs are to be found			0
they are the 99 %			0
the discipline of their demonstrations , the clarity of their moral voice , has touched a chord			0
now groups are organizing to occupy financial districts all over the world			1
i 've been to many of the occupy sites : in @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , just last month in @entity96			1
i 've seen the faces and places of the @entity99			0
but @entity74 is more than places			0
occupy is a spirit whose time has come , capturing the people and the world 's imagination with a keen focus on the gaps of inequality , unfairness and corruption			1
the @entity113 ' cause is a just cause , a moral cause			0
it can not and will not be dismissed , but heard			0
listen to the message : they are the canary in the mine warning us of the dangers ... too few have too much ; too many have too little ; too much poverty , too much wanting in the land of plenty ; too many costly wars			0
biblically , @entity129 was an occupier			1
born under occupation , facing a death warrant on his life , he fled to @entity134 -- an immigrant , a political refugee			0
he represented hope for the oppressed ; his mission was to serve the poor			1
he challenged the prevailing ethos and power of @entity142			0
he marched to the sea protesting colonialism and @entity148 occupation			0
@entity150 was an occupier , his country occupied by the ruthlessness of apartheid			1
but @entity150 occupied his jail cell on @entity155 , turning it into a library , a center for peaceful , non-violent revolution			1
dr. @entity161 was an occupier , our country occupied by the vicious and divisive legal segregation			1
his last great campaign was the @entity165 , aimed at occupying the @entity166 in the nation 's @entity167 to address abounding poverty , the demands for a job or an income for all , health care for all			1
when dr. @entity161 was shot down on april 4 , the campaign moved on to @entity93 , setting up @entity165 and occupying the nation 's @entity167 in tents			1
it was the precursor to today 's occupy movement			1
deep into a recession that nearly drove the world economy over the brink in 2008 , the eurozone crisis and the recent downgrades of @entity184 countries remind us ever to starkly that the dangers of economic collapse remain with us today			0
banks got bailed out ; people got left out			0
banks are making record profits and issuing billions in executive compensation bonuses again			0
but protestors are criminalized -- homeowners are still being foreclosed on while others find themselves " underwater " with debt exceeding the value of their homes			0
student loan debt now exceeds credit card debt , and our youth are finding it increasingly difficult to enter , and stay in , college			0
big banks are still not lending to small businesses			0
yet for all of the excess and scandalous trading practices and policies , not a single top executive from a @entity12 bank has gone to jail for their crimes of corruption and greed that drove the global economy to the brink of disaster			0
in this mirror , a movement for change is building across the country			0
it was reported that the @entity6 traders drank champagne in their offices as they looked down on the drenched and straggly demonstrators in @entity9			1
they should hold their scorn			0
this is how change takes place			1
the courageous stand up -- and more and more people come to their side			0
the movement for jobs and justice has started up again			0
as we commemorate dr. @entity161 's birthday this month , we occupy			1
we are not just dreaming , we are occupying			0
occupying until justice rolls down like mighty water			0
occupying until a new day of justice appears			0
occupying until the bright morning appears			0
occupying until peace and love , hope and justice prevails in our land			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of reverend @entity252 .			1

rev. @entity252 supports the non-violent protests that took place on @entity6 .
he thinks the occupy movements have *spotted* the widening gap between rich and poor .
many spiritual and *oppositional* *leaders* from *history* carried an occupier spirit , finds @entity252 .
@entity252 calls for further movements to commemorate dr. @entity161 's birthday this month .
