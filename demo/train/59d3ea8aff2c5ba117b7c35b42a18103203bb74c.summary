@entity0 -- an unprecedented summit of @entity4 leaders in @entity0			1
an @entity6 outbreak in @entity7 that sparks global fears			1
the two events this week juxtaposed the best and worst of @entity7 at a time when its leaders want to move , finally , past perceptions of a " dark continent " rife with war , poverty and disease			1
those problems exist , as demonstrated by the @entity6 crisis threatening to spread beyond the epicenter of neighbors @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23			0
so does evidence of galloping economies and prolonged political stability in countries across @entity7 , a point emphasized repeatedly at the @entity0 gathering hosted by @entity31 's first @entity4 - @entity31 president			1
5 reasons @entity35 's @entity7 leaders ' summit matters @entity36 , not just aid leaders who once came seeking aid now make deals for trade , citing statistics to boost their case			1
six of the world 's fastest developing economies are in @entity7			2
burgeoning middle classes offer growing markets for foreign goods			0
to @entity56 president @entity55 , the summit " should allow us to confirm the change of perspective towards a vision of @entity7 " from a continent that " used to need aid			1
" he cited the evolving perception chronicled by @entity59 , which ran a may 2000 cover with a picture of a gun - toting @entity4 above the phrase " the hopeless continent			2
" eleven years later , the same magazine 's cover heralded " @entity7 rising			2
" president @entity35 emphasized the same point on wednesday , declaring that " we are here to take action -- concrete steps to build on @entity7 's progress and forge the partnerships of equals that we seek			1
" he announced more money for @entity7 , both aid and investment : $ 12 billion more for an existing program to provide electricity in @entity76 , and $ 14 billion from companies including @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81			2
@entity83 ahead @entity4 leaders told @entity35 that the @entity31 needed to catch up with other foreign investors on their continent -- especially @entity83			1
for the past two decades , @entity87 has poured billions into @entity7 for roads , bridges , mines and other development needed to extract natural resources sent back home and elsewhere			0
in some @entity4 countries , governments and local communities have chafed at resulting environmental harm and the use of imported @entity83 labor instead of local workers			0
@entity35 got a dig in at @entity83 about that , telling his @entity4 visitors that the @entity31 would be a responsible partner			1
" we do n't look to @entity7 simply for its natural resources ; we recognize @entity7 for its greatest resource , which is its people and its talents and their potential , " he said tuesday to applause			0
" we do n't simply want to extract minerals from the ground for our growth ; we want to build genuine partnerships that create jobs and opportunity for all our peoples and that unleash the next era of @entity4 growth			0
" overall , international trade and aid to @entity7 have increased in recent years after slowing due to the global recession			1
@entity4 aid and investment according to the @entity129 put out by a consortium of international organizations , the total amount of external money flowing to the continent was expected to exceed $ 200 billion in 2013			1
the report showed government aid slowing while direct business investment , portfolio investment and remittances -- money sent to home countries by @entity139 living abroad -- grew at faster clips			0
at the same time , new security concerns over @entity143 extremists such as @entity144 in @entity145 and @entity146 in @entity147 raise questions about future risk for investors			0
after disastrous @entity4 interventions such as @entity154 , when @entity156 peacekeepers failed to prevent the 1994 genocide , the @entity31 and @entity152 allies have sought to shift more of the security burden on the @entity159 and individual nations			2
security issues at his news conference concluding the summit , @entity35 announced additional funding and resources to bolster such @entity4 efforts such as a new security initiative " to help @entity4 countries continue to build strong professional security forces , to provide for their own security			1
" " we also agreed to make significant new investments in @entity4 peacekeeping , " he said			1
" the @entity31 will provide additional equipment to @entity4 peacekeepers in @entity145 and the @entity176			0
we will support the @entity159 's efforts to strengthen its peacekeeping institutions			2
and most importantly , we 're launching a new @entity4 peacekeeping rapid - response partnership , with the goal of quickly deploying @entity4 peacekeepers in support of @entity156 or @entity159 missions			1
" however , the summit also showed the difficulty that @entity4 leaders have getting a handle on the security issue			1
at a session tuesday , the leaders of @entity190 and @entity191 initially argued over the scope of the problem			0
" @entity7 is more secure today than it was many years ago , " said @entity190 president @entity195 , at the same time acknowledging that troubles continue with @entity197 - affiliated @entity144			2
" from time to time they will bomb this , ignite a bomb there			0
" opinion : @entity7 and @entity31 : invest in human rights " we still have huge problems " his @entity191 counterpart , interim president @entity206 , took exception			2
we still have huge problems in @entity210 , " he interjected			0
" we still have huge problem in @entity212 , you know , where people are starving			0
there is a terrible situation in @entity212			0
we have a terrible situation in the northern part of @entity220			0
" @entity206 then agreed with @entity195 that @entity7 was " much more secure than before , but we are still facing a challenge , an important challenge on the matter of security , and we have to work together as @entity7			2
" @entity4 president @entity225 , meanwhile , blamed insecurity in @entity227 and elsewhere in @entity228 on the @entity230 upheaval			0
promising @entity4 solutions to the continent 's security challenges , @entity225 summed up the most significant benefit the summit provided -- the chance for he and other leaders to represent their countries in such a prominent setting			1
" today i think we stand a better chance as countries in the continent to better ourselves , " he said			0
" that is why we appreciate this opportunity , because we have been in a position to tell our own story rather than people telling the story on our behalf			0
" opinion : what 's missing from the @entity7 summit			1
