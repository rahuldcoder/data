@entity0 -- the @entity2 is the oldest , and arguably the most powerful , in @entity3 with members responsible for writing the nation 's tax laws			1
but a @entity1 investigation of all 39 @entity8 and @entity9 on the committee found that at least eight members have faced tax problems of their own			1
for example , @entity14 rep. @entity13 has been late paying his property taxes at least 46 times since 2005			1
and he racked up more than $ 6,200 in penalties and interest on more than $ 100,000 in taxes , according to county records			1
on a stunning lake house in @entity14 's @entity24 region and a home in @entity26 , @entity13 missed a combined 16 tax payments over nine years			1
on three other buildings in @entity26 and another in @entity29 , @entity13 had a total of 20 late payments over eight years			2
and on a mobile home park and two other commercial properties , @entity13 was late on his taxes 10 times since 2007 , according to county records			1
so what happened ? " you know it 's just like a lot of people , these are things that just happen and they were paid within the allotted time , " @entity13 told @entity1			2
but unlike a lot of people , @entity13 is charged with writing the nation 's tax laws			1
asked if he should be helping to write laws he has trouble following , the @entity9 lawmaker said , " well , i mean these are real property tax bills , which is different than what the @entity2 does with income tax bills			1
and i mean we 're paying them , we paid them within the allotted time and that 's it			0
" @entity13 likened the late tax payments to missing a utility bill , saying that while he was late -- and paid penalties because of it -- the taxes never went unpaid			1
@entity65 of the watchdog group @entity66 said that " lots of @entity68 run afoul of tax laws , but you 'd think the people who are actually writing it would n't get this wrong			1
take @entity76 @entity75 rep. @entity75 , for instance			0
he fought state tax officials for years , refusing to pay nearly $ 1.4 million in back income taxes , interest and penalties			1
@entity75 declined several interview requests , but a spokeswoman issued a statement			0
@entity75 was " appealing an attempt by the new tax commissioner to impose a unilateral and retroactive tax on @entity76 taxpayers			0
in a 3 - 2 split decision , the state @entity89 ruled that the commissioner had the authority to impose the retroactive tax			2
at that time , while he strongly disagreed with decision to levy taxes retroactively , @entity75 paid the assessment in full , including interest and penalties , " the statement said			0
but the @entity76 tax commissioner categorized @entity75 's battle differently , writing in his final determination that his fellow @entity9 " failed to act in good faith			1
" another @entity76 , rep. @entity105 , was criticized for not paying employment taxes on his campaign workers			0
instead of hiring employees for the 2008 and 2010 campaigns , he hired consultants as independent contractors -- and avoided the payroll taxes			0
the @entity9 said he followed @entity114 rules			0
" we have a tax lawyer			0
that 's part of the reason why campaigns are so expensive because we have a @entity120 who does our filing , " he said			0
" we have tax lawyers that are on call to make sure that we follow the letter of the law			0
" but @entity65 called the lawmakers ' tax problems " outrageous			2
" " nobody wants to feel like a chump when they 're paying their taxes and if they see that their lawmakers , the ones who actually write the tax laws , are n't paying their bills , it 's going to make them wonder why they 're paying theirs , " @entity65 said			1
some of the transgressions were relatively minor			0
for instance , @entity140 @entity9 rep. @entity9 had to pay a $ 59 fine after understating his income			1
and @entity144 @entity143 rep. @entity143 paid $ 1,500 in tax penalties after a mortgage escrow mix up			2
" i accept full responsibility for past late payments , and have paid all taxes and fees i owed			2
i regret the errors and offer no excuses , " @entity143 told @entity1 in a statement			0
" since then , i have taken corrective action to ensure this does n't occur again			0
" @entity158 @entity157 rep. @entity157 's situation was a bit more complicated			0
a property that she and her husband own racked up almost $ 4,000 in penalties and interest after her husband 's business paid the bill late			1
a spokesman explained that the company did not receive the tax notice , but paid the bill the day that company officials learned it was overdue			2
@entity176 @entity9 @entity175 's run - ins with the @entity114 make him the frontrunner for most expensive tax problem , costing him $ 2.5 million			1
@entity175 fought the @entity114 contention that he owed an additional $ 1 million in taxes			1
in 2002 , after years of fighting , he paid $ 1.2 million in taxes -- the amount he insisted he owed -- plus another $ 1.3 million in penalties and interest he racked up during the fight			1
finally , there 's @entity14 democrat @entity187			0
he lost his chairmanship of the committee in 2010 and was censured in part for his failure to pay taxes on rental income from his swank villa in the @entity195			2
yet years later , both @entity187 and @entity175 still sit on the committee			0
how @entity0 spends your taxes @entity1 's @entity199 and @entity200 contributed to this report			2
