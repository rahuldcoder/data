-- stop us if you 've heard this before : tech geeks are the new rock stars			1
@entity5 is a " hotbed of innovation			1
" and some people who work in tech are n't nerdy			2
these nuggets of insight , and much more , are on display in a new preview video for an upcoming reality series , " @entity15 : @entity5 , " which premieres november 5 on @entity16			1
the show promises to follow six budding tech entrepreneurs as they try to market their ideas , launch companies and get really , really rich			1
but @entity16 is not interested in watching engineers code			1
instead , the clip shows its young , attractive stars lounging poolside , rock climbing , doing shots , going to toga parties and boasting about their " ' work hard , play hard ' mentality			1
" there 's no mention of what products , if any , they 've created			0
but the promo does pack an impressive number of clich√©s and tangled metaphors into its 2 minutes , 21 seconds			2
among the better ones : " this is the moment we have to up our game even more than ever			0
" " the future of the world is in our hands , and we 're not sitting back and letting it pass us by			0
" " @entity5 is just balls to the wall			2
it 's not something you do if you do n't want to roll the dice			0
" then there 's the young woman who motions to her face and says , " people have been intimidated , because this package generally does n't come with a brain			0
" shockingly , the @entity56 has not been kind			0
" if you watch the latest promo for @entity16 's @entity5 reality show and think , hey these entrepreneurs failed actors are just stringing together tech buzzwords , it 's because that 's exactly what they 're doing , " writes @entity57			1
" this show looks awful , but we 'd be lying if we said we were n't going to watch @entity15 ... with glee / horror			1
" the video trailer has a rating of two out of five stars -- on @entity16 's own website			1
a commenter on the show 's facebook page says , " you focused on an exception not the rule and in the process you disrespect most of @entity5			1
" and on @entity83 , @entity82 co-editor @entity81 quipped , " @entity85 @entity84			0
" the tv show has a respectable pedigree : it 's co-produced by @entity89 , former marketing director of @entity90 and sister of its founder , @entity92			0
but early observers still give the promo low marks for authenticity			0
" @entity98 ! @entity100 women sure do n't look like that in the show			0
well for that matter the men either , " wrote one commenter on @entity57			0
" sadly , @entity107 people apparently do n't exist in the @entity109 version of @entity5			2
" our clever cousins at @entity114 recommend that viewers turn the show into a drinking game in which they do a shot every time a " business development session " is held poolside and " swill the whole bottle when someone actually writes a line of code			2
