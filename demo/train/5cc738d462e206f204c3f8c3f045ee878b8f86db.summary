armed with her mobile phone , @entity0 embarks on her daily online routine , scouring the internet to keep up - to - date with what 's happening in her city of @entity6 , @entity7			1
but these days , along with her daily dose of news and e-mail , @entity0 's web expedition also involves one of her favorite pastimes : shopping			0
" i go online every day , " says @entity0 , a 26 - year - old store manager , " to check for something , to just see if i can get whatever i want to buy			0
online shopping saves you time and money because it is cheaper and fast , " she adds			0
@entity0 is among a growing generation of young , internet - savvy @entity22 who have embraced new technology , driving efforts in the continent to bridge the gap between the virtual and real worlds			0
according to the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) , internet - user penetration in @entity30 has grown from 0.5 % in 2000 to 10.6 % last year			1
although the figure is still far behind the world average of about 30 % , an increasing number of @entity22 are becoming more familiar with online shopping			0
both the proliferation of mobile phones and the rollout of faster internet networks -- like the fiber - optic cables launched in areas such as east @entity30 -- have helped the expansion of e-commerce activities in countries such as @entity7 , @entity45 and @entity46			1
in @entity45 , 51 % of those with access to the internet are shopping online , according to a 2011 @entity51 survey			2
in @entity46 , a recent survey by @entity53 and the @entity54 found that 18 % and 24 % of the 1,700 respondents go online to purchase music and movies , and electronic books			0
in @entity7 , @entity30 's most populous country , internet penetration is at about 28 % , according to @entity31 figures , boosted by the rapid growth in the country 's telecoms sector			1
in recent years , the number of mobile cellular subscriptions has skyrocketed from 30,000 in 2000 to over 87 million in 2010			0
@entity7 's untapped mobile market yet , the country 's online buying culture is still in its infancy			1
" while internet usage has hugely increased in @entity7 over the past few years , the online shopping market is still quite small by world standards , " says @entity71 , founder of @entity72 , a @entity6 - based technology news and research startup			1
" one would expect the @entity7 online shopping market to be huge and highly lucrative -- instead , the market is still at an infant stage , although with huge potential to explode in the next five years , " he adds			1
it is this big potential that has prompted the emergence of a new crop of internet developers in the country , eager to tap the money - making opportunities available online			1
one of them is @entity90 , a @entity7 technology entrepreneur who has founded @entity91 , a @entity93 style group - buying site that offers its members in @entity6 discounted deals on a range of products and services			2
every day @entity91 sends an email to customers like @entity0 with all the latest discounts such as restaurant and spa offers			0
if the required amount of customers is reached , members receive a coupon along with details about their purchase 's collection			0
@entity90 , who has also worked for @entity110 and @entity111 , says the model has struck a chord with customers looking to make the most out of the benefits of online shopping -- @entity91 plans to expand to @entity116 , @entity7 's capital , and claims to have over 50,000 members since its launch in march , adding about 1,000 people per day , @entity90 says			1
yet , promoting e-commerce in a country with high internet costs , slow connectivity and a bad reputation for online scams does not come without its challenges			1
@entity90 says that building a strong logistics infrastructure is necessary for the growth of e-commerce in developing countries			0
for that reason @entity91 has invested in in - house systems as well as pick - up points where customers can collect their items			0
" if you start an internet business in @entity7 , it 's not about a web browser or a mobile phone browser , " he says			1
" many times the internet is an enabler of a business but you still need an offline component , strong logistics , you still need to be able to have a physical presence in front of the developing country customer to keep that customer thinking that you are real and are here for the long - run			2
" analysts say that a major problem confronting users in the country is the lack of a convenient and reliable electronic payment service that enables consumers to make payment for goods bought online -- the penetration of debit and credit cards is still low and in many cases online shoppers are still required to physically go to the bank and make a deposit to confirm their purchase			2
@entity71 notes that @entity7 consumers with reliable internet access are still skeptical about shopping online , since there 's a feeling that such transactions are risky and prone to fraud			1
" consumers hardly want to make payments for goods via an online platform , especially since they would n't like to give out their personal details on the internet for fear of identity theft and other related issues , " he says			2
" most people still prefer to visit their favorite retail shops and make their purchases , where payments are usually made with cash , " adds @entity71			0
@entity189 , head of @entity7 operations for @entity191 , a @entity45 - based online retailer that expanded last year in @entity7 and @entity46 , says that shifting consumer behavior toward e-commerce and building trust is a gradual process			1
" the experience has been that when people come in , they try to test with a little amount of order and then when we deliver to them they consider to buy and increase their amount , " says @entity189			0
" that shows us that a lot of people have that fear			0
" yet , despite all the challenges , analysts believe @entity7 's e-commerce sector has the potential to take off within the next few years as the market continues to develop at a fast pace			1
" i think that @entity7 would eventually embrace online shopping as long as it offers them an easy , safe and convenient way to shop online , " says @entity71			2
and for some young shoppers like @entity0 , e-commerce is here to stay			0
" online shopping has already become a success story in @entity7 , especially amongst the youth of today , " she says .			2

a new crop of entrepreneurs are keen to tap the potential of @entity30 's online market
logistics , high internet costs and consumer fears over scams are some of the challenges
