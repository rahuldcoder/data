-- @entity1 swarmed @entity3 's @entity2 to demand that their first freely elected leader respect their wishes , hoping to revive a democratic groundswell that swept the country 's former strongman from power nearly two years ago			1
protesters waved flags and banners , chanted slogans and called on president @entity15 to roll back last week 's decree giving himself expanded presidential powers -- or resign			1
the crowd included many different @entity1 factions , including @entity21 - style liberals , secularists , moderates and women 's rights activists			2
" i 'm here because this is our country -- all of us , " one woman told @entity0			1
it 's not just for our president			2
" but @entity15 showed no signs of backing down			2
@entity1 's @entity34 chief , @entity33 , said there will be no retreat from the constitutional decree , state - run @entity31 reported			1
he reportedly stressed the president would not back down because his move was motivated by democratic aims			0
there were no official crowd estimates for @entity2			0
but the square was packed as protesters clogged the roundabout and tents filled the grassy area in the middle			0
the rally lasted into wednesday 's early hours , with some demonstrators singing and playing drums and guitars while others listened to speeches			0
though the protest was mostly peaceful , at least one demonstrator died in early clashes with authorities ahead of tuesday night 's massive rally , the @entity55 said			2
the opposition @entity61 said the protester died after inhaling excessive amounts of tear gas , which police used in numerous scuffles with rock - throwing protesters on the side streets leading to the square			0
and in the @entity72 city of @entity73 , police reported dozens of injuries when demonstrators stormed the headquarters of the @entity77 , @entity15 's political movement , @entity80 spokesman @entity79 told @entity0			2
police also used tear gas to break up the melees and made numerous arrests , but the building was destroyed , @entity79 said			0
@entity86 , a spokesman for the @entity87 -- the @entity77 's political arm -- said the @entity90 protesters carried knives , swords , clubs and guns and battled @entity77 supporters for four hours			0
across the country , 116 people were injured in protests in @entity3 and elsewhere , @entity31 reported , citing the @entity55			1
protesters are angry with @entity15 for his declaration last week that his edicts are beyond the reach of judges in what critics call an unprecedented power grab			0
a statement monday night that appeared to at least partially limit the scope of the decree did not seem to salve their anger			0
on monday , his office clarified the edict , saying it only applied to " sovereign matters			0
" @entity15 " did not give himself judicial power " but did provide " immunity for his presidential decisions , " said @entity114 , a senior adviser in the @entity87			0
@entity114 added that " the president himself ( is ) not immune from judicial oversight , " though it was n't clear in what instances that would come into practice , or if there was anything preventing @entity15 from issuing a new decree so this could not happen			1
protesters want to show that " the whole population of @entity1 is against " @entity15 and his backers , said former finance minister @entity133			1
@entity15 and his @entity77 supporters have defended the policy as necessary to defend the fragile @entity137 revolution that pushed former president @entity138 from power and led to the country 's first free elections			1
on tuesday , the @entity77 's official @entity143 feed dismissed the protests as underwhelming and said what it described as a low turnout indicated a " lack of support among @entity1			1
" but @entity1 journalist @entity149 said the crowds have turned out to tell @entity15 , " we are your checks and balances			1
" " we are the people who will keep you honest , right after you grabbed all of this power for yourself that has made you even more powerful than @entity138 , who we got rid of last year , " @entity149 told @entity0			0
" so , the people are there to say , ' we might have elected you as president , but we did not elect a new dictator			0
' " @entity149 said @entity1 's judiciary does need to be " cleansed " -- " but the way to help @entity1 toward freedom is not by paving it with dictatorship			1
" the @entity77 scrapped its own demonstration to show support for @entity15 -- also scheduled for tuesday -- " to avoid any problems due to tension in the political arena , " said spokesman @entity173			1
but the @entity77 @entity143 feed told opponents to brace for " millions in support of the elected prez			0
" opinion : do n't blame @entity77 for @entity15 power grab @entity15 's decree thursday said that judges ca n't overturn his decisions or interfere with an @entity184 - dominated council writing a new constitution			1
he also sacked the nation 's top prosecutor			0
in addition to outbursts on the street , @entity1 's judges have reacted			1
all but seven of @entity1 's 34 courts and 90 % of its prosecutors went on strike monday in protest , said judge @entity196 of the @entity197			1
he described @entity15 's edict as " the most vicious ... attack on the judicial authority 's independence			2
" edict divides @entity1 , unifies opponents @entity15 insists he 's trying to protect @entity1 's fragile @entity137 revolution , not accumulate unchecked power			1
his moves " cemented the process that would create the institutions that would limit his power , define the constitution and have parliamentary elections so that we can say this is a democracy , " said @entity114			0
senior presidential aide @entity214 called concerns about @entity15 's edict overblown , blaming the protests on " counterrevolutionary forces " loyal to @entity138 's party			1
polls show " an overwhelming majority supporting president @entity15 and his decisions , " @entity114 said monday			1
analysis : @entity15 makes his move but that 's not how his political foes -- seen as " heretics " by many members of the @entity77 , according to @entity230 fellow @entity229 -- look at the situation			2
@entity232 , who 'd been in the now - dissolved parliament , said action is needed to prevent more " suffering " under a president with " sweeping powers , " as @entity1 had for 60 years under men like @entity138 , @entity236 and @entity237			2
" @entity15 is the ... president who has sweeping executive ( power ) , sweeping legislative ( power ) and ... puts himself above the judicial branch of government , " said @entity232 , founder of @entity1 's @entity240			1
" that is a very dangerous mix , which can only lead to a dictatorship			0
" the rest of the world is watching , too			0
former @entity251 diplomat @entity250 said @entity15 's edict " brings to mind all the fears that people in that part of the world have had about the @entity77 when it comes to democracy			2
" @entity15 to meet with top judicial body the unrest raises new concerns about stability in @entity1 , which has gone through two years of protests and turmoil			1
" the majority of the people are really suffering , and they were looking forward to some stability , " said @entity133 , the former finance minister , who served under @entity138 as well as in the government that followed him			0
" i 'm afraid that this constitutional declaration has blown it up			0
" @entity273 leaders in @entity1 for cease - fire talks @entity0 's @entity275 and journalists @entity276 and @entity278 reported from @entity3			2
