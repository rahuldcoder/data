-- @entity1 , @entity2 , is n't just a town			1
that 's why it hurt so much one year ago thursday when an enormous explosion at a fertilizer plant claimed 15 lives while destroying 120 homes and damaging 200 others across 37 blocks , shattering windows well beyond that			1
the blast was earth - shattering , registering on seismographs as a 2.1 - magnitude earthquake and shaking homes 50 miles away			1
the 10 - foot crater the blast left behind pales in comparison to the holes left in the hearts of the town 's 2,800 residents			1
" no one 's life was untouched , " says @entity25 , owner of the @entity26 , a local gathering spot			2
everyone felt the blast : those who buried loved ones and the neighbors who consoled them			1
the displaced students learning @entity35 in trailers because their schools were condemned			1
homeowners left without a home and the friends who took them in			1
mayor @entity42 is " not surprised at all " by how his community came together			1
some might attribute this spirit to the resiliency of the @entity46 who helped settle and still help define the community			2
others may credit the strong faith of its residents			1
or it may be a product of life in a place where everyone knows everyone and wo n't leave their neighbors behind			2
it 's telling that , in a town of 2,800 , very few left			2
" ( @entity65 ) pulled themselves up , shook themselves off and started moving forward			2
" they just did what needed to be done			2
" thanks to this hard work , this unity , these values -- not to mention well - placed , much - needed government assistance -- the mayor says , " we 're going to have a new normal someday			1
" but that day is n't here			2
and the old normal in @entity1 is n't coming back			1
newly released video shows moment of deadly blast war zone now a construction zone still , the evidence is everywhere that @entity1 is rising again			1
it is happening brick by brick , shingle by shingle , prayer by prayer			0
what once looked like a war zone is a construction zone			0
already , 25 new homes are finished , with about 60 others nearing completion , according to the mayor			1
a new emergency services facility has replaced a tiny construction trailer			0
work has begun on rebuilding the @entity98 , a nursing home and once one of the town 's biggest employers			1
downtown storefronts , which last year had boarded windows , are bustling with business			0
" we can see something happening , " says dr. @entity106 , @entity1 's director of emergency medical services			1
" there is light at the end of the tunnel			0
" the view was hard to envision that fateful wednesday night last spring			0
@entity106 was in @entity98 , where he is medical director , when the building 's ceiling and windows collapsed on him			0
somehow , he and the facility 's residents were able to escape			1
the very next morning , city officials , including the mayor and several council members who themselves had been left homeless , went to work			1
nonprofit groups from the @entity124 to faith - based groups to volunteers who just wanted to help flocked to the small town			0
in the three days after the blast , the @entity133 treated more than 120 animals -- horses , sheep , chickens and a cow and her calf in the field , household pets like dogs , cats , rabbits , even a bearded dragon -- says spokeswoman @entity143			2
twelve months later , authorities still have n't pinpointed the cause of the blast , but an electrical malfunction , a spark from a golf cart or an intentional act have n't been ruled out			2
for now , the state fire marshal 's office and the federal @entity152 will only say their joint investigation " is active and ongoing			0
" while nothing publicly has changed on the investigative front since may , the status of federal assistance took a big step forward in august when president @entity160 's administration issued a disaster declaration that paved the way for funding for things like new infrastructure and millions of dollars for new schools			2
when they open in fall 2015 , those new school buildings will be better than what they replaced			0
there will also someday be a park and memorial			2
the 120 - bed nursing home is expected to be state - of - the - art. new infrastructure and homes likewise will be improvements			1
as @entity106 notes , " in the long run , we 're actually going to be better " as a town in many ways			2
@entity42 concurs , while in the same breath adding : " anything we get as a benefit for this is too much a price to pay for the 11 firemen , two civilians who helped out and two civilians killed			0
" loss of lives hits small town hard in a community full of strong people , the mayor said among the strongest are the 13 women who lost their husbands			2
" they are doing as well as can be expected , " @entity42 says , acknowledging that thursday 's memorial may reopen some of the wounds			0
" it 's not going to ever go away			0
the sting of losing a loved one radiates long after they are gone			0
" adds @entity202 , whose bakery specializing in kolaches and other @entity46 foods is a frequent meeting place for residents , " @entity207 does heal			2
but you do n't forget			0
" even with reconstruction abounding , she adds , " from an emotional standpoint , it seems like it was just yesterday			0
" some say the tragedy contributed to more than the initial loss of life			0
@entity98 's residents dispersed to about 10 facilities after the explosion , leaving their friends and caretakers behind			1
over the past year , these elderly people died at about twice the rate that would have been expected , @entity106 says			1
" people ask me if it had anything to do with the explosion , " he says			2
" and i say , ' yes , it certainly does			0
' " the loss of the nursing home did n't just affect its residents			1
@entity233 , 91 , misses his almost daily trips to visit friends at @entity98 and misses the weekly masses there , according to his daughter , @entity237			0
a reunion a few months ago cheered up the nursing home 's former residents , as did the recent groundbreaking on the new facility			1
their feelings are similar to many others displaced by the blast , @entity106 says : " most of them want to get back to @entity1 as soon as possible			1
" @entity248 lost two cousins , both firefighters , in the explosion			2
a lawyer who returned a decade ago to @entity1 , where his father had been the town blacksmith , @entity248 says , " it 's difficult to put into words " how his and other families are able to rebound emotionally			1
but reflecting on the town 's history of settlers who fled oppression in @entity260 and of sending men like himself , a @entity264 veteran , to serve in the @entity266 military , @entity248 said the people of @entity1 have shown their resilience time and again			1
" we 're survivors , " said @entity248 , who is the @entity46 's honorary consul general in @entity2			1
" and we are also fighters			0
... @entity270 gives us a wake - up call every so often , and we respond to it			0
" ' we will put it back together ' residents say their faith has been instrumental in understanding and dealing with last april 's tragedy			1
@entity202 says the anniversary falling so close to @entity279 -- with its message of resurrection and renewal -- is especially appropriate for the people of @entity1			1
@entity248 lauds not just his own catholic church , but churches of other denominations that helped heal the mourning community			0
" what i have seen is a community come together like ( one ) could have never imagined , " he says			0
" ... we have the blessings of the life remaining			0
and we will put it back together			0
" whoever one talks to , that word -- community -- comes up again and again			0
@entity296 , who grew up in the town and still visits regularly , " the people of @entity1 have always helped each other			1
" @entity202 was living and working in @entity299 , where she was a vice president in @entity302 's marketing division , after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks			0
the scale of the destruction and suffering was immense , but even then there were many people in the city who did n't know anyone personally affected			0
that 's not true for @entity1 , to which @entity202 returned seven years ago after her father 's death			1
it 's still a place where everyone seemingly runs into each other every day , be it at her bakery , the supermarket , the hardware store or church			0
a lot of people do n't readily complain or ask for help , but they now more than ever realize their neighbors will open their doors , wallets and hearts when it 's needed			0
what 's most different now is that , through this terrible tragedy , people the world round have gotten to know @entity1			1
it 's not just a town on the east side of @entity337 , a dot on the map between @entity339 and @entity340			0
" people know now that @entity1 is truly a place , " says @entity202			1
" and actually , quite a special place			0
" @entity0 's @entity344 and @entity345 contributed to this report .			0
