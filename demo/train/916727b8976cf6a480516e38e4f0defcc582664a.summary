@entity0 , @entity1 -- deafening peals of gunfire heralded the arrival of the caskets			1
there were 28 in all			2
one of them was only about two feet long and held aloft by a single man			2
some of the robed men carrying these crude coffins wept loudly			2
all of them repeated the same chant : " there is no @entity15 but @entity16 , and a martyr is loved by @entity16			2
" at one point , some of the mourners pointed to the sky			2
a single warplane roared high overhead , appearing white against the cloudless blue backdrop			0
@entity1 government officials said the mass funeral witnessed by foreign journalists tuesday in the village of @entity29 accounted for a fraction of the people killed by a series of deadly airstrikes late monday night			1
" eighty - five @entity1 civilians , including 33 children , 20 men , 32 women and we 're still counting , were massacred last night in an intensive air raid by @entity44 on the town of @entity46 , " declared the spokesman for @entity36 's besieged government , @entity37			1
it is impossible for @entity2 to confirm the extent of the casualties , and whether or not they were all civilian			0
@entity37 addressed journalists from the rubble of one of five houses that he said had been bombed the previous night			1
inside , a burned mattress was still smoking and the smell of explosive was in the air			0
as @entity37 spoke , two plumes of smoke erupted in the distance			0
it was n't clear whether the explosions came from airstrikes or artillery			0
@entity37 accused @entity44 of bombing @entity0 to clear the way for rebels to advance on the embattled @entity36 - controlled city of @entity66 , located just a few kilometers to the north			1
" this is a crime beyond imagination , " he concluded			0
for weeks , @entity44 warplanes have been bombing @entity66 on a daily basis			1
meanwhile , rebels have been pressing toward @entity66 's eastern gates from the nearby opposition - held port of @entity76			0
in an e-mail to @entity2 , @entity44 confirmed that aircraft bombed targets south of @entity66 monday night			1
but a spokesman for the military alliance denied targeting civilians			1
" @entity44 had very clear intelligence demonstrating that former farm buildings were being used as a staging point for @entity91 forces to conduct attacks against the people of @entity1 , " wrote a public affairs officer with @entity44 's @entity84 , on condition of anonymity			1
" we do not have evidence of civilian casualties at this stage , although military casualties , including mercenaries , are very likely owing to the nature of the target			1
" determined to prove there was no presence of military personnel , @entity1 government officials escorted a busload of foreign journalists to the scene of the bombardment			1
there were three neighboring compounds containing five bombed - out houses			0
mattresses , clothes and books littered the ground			0
when journalists arrived at a shattered two - story house , several men began digging for what they said were the bodies of two boys named @entity122 and @entity123 , trapped in the rubble			1
no bodies were found during the journalists ' visit			1
another house was littered with medical textbooks written in @entity130			0
a man , who joined the government entourage escorting journalists throughout the day , yelled angrily and waved two brightly colored schoolbooks as proof that children had been inside the destroyed house			1
inside one notebook , a girl had written her name in latin letters : @entity142			0
government officials said the first bomb dropped in the area around 11 p.m. monday			2
they said a second airstrike slammed into the area moments later , as people were coming to rescue survivors			1
despite the alleged massive loss of life in the target zone , journalists were not able to find a single trace of blood or flesh amid the ruins			2
@entity1 state television , however , has been airing grisly night - time footage of rescuers digging through rubble with their bare hands and in some cases uncovering severed limbs			1
there was little doubt that 60 - year - old @entity168 ' family had just suffered terrible , heart - wrenching tragedy			0
next to the ruins of his two - story house , another elderly man embraced him , weeping			0
later , @entity122 visited the intensive care unit at @entity66 's main hospital , and sobbed by the bedside of his wounded wife			0
@entity178 , a nurse from @entity179 , said @entity181 ' wife lost one of her legs in the bomb attack			0
" i am 54 years old , " said @entity185 , another @entity179 nurse			0
" i never knew what war was until @entity44 started bombing @entity66 several weeks ago			1
" hospital workers said almost all the other wounded people had been transported to @entity189 for treatment			0
instead , they brought journalists to a morgue that was overflowing with corpses			1
many were badly mangled and burned			0
a man stood amid the bodies and pools of blood , showing journalists the grisly faces of the dead			2
screaming at the top of his lungs , he denounced @entity44			1
at one point , he lifted the dead body of a 2 - year - old girl named @entity206 to emphasize his point			0
@entity206 's father , @entity208 , stood waiting outside			0
he said his mother and another daughter were both badly wounded in monday night 's attack			0
and he listed the names of eight other members of his extended family who had been killed when the bombs slammed into his house : an elderly woman named @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity224 and another woman named @entity218 who was 25			2
@entity44 insists its mission in @entity1 is " to protect civilians against attacks or threat of attack			1
" if 85 civilians had in fact been killed monday night , this would mark the bloodiest case of civilian casualties caused by aerial bombardment since @entity44 began its bombing campaign nearly five months ago			1
at @entity66 hospital , some medical workers gave wildly divergent numbers for how many people had been killed in the attack			2
" forty people died , " said a medical student in a white lab coat named @entity245 outside the morgue			2
when a bystander corrected him , @entity245 revised his number dramatically , announcing with confidence : " 85 dead			2
" @entity168 appeared oblivious to the fierce propaganda war being waged between the @entity36 regime and @entity44 and its rebel allies			1
at the mass funeral on tuesday , he faced the aftermath of the war of bombs and bullets			0
the gray - haired man stood crying amid the dust and heat and wild , angry gunfire next to the big pit where his 24 - year - old daughter @entity265 was being buried			0
" if you want to get rid of @entity36 , why do n't you just sent your special forces to kill him ? " asked a @entity1 bystander , who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals from government officials			1
" instead , you are making these ordinary people suffer			0

@entity1 official says 85 civilians killed in @entity44 airstrike
@entity44 says it targeted a former farm used as a " military staging area "
