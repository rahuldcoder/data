@entity0 , @entity1 -- the last thing we heard before going into @entity6 prison here was the sound of a metal door closing behind us and the clanking of bolts and locks			1
@entity6 is home to some of @entity1 's most violent criminals , including terrorists			1
it is also the new home of @entity19 , who is charged in the murder of a young @entity1 woman , and has long been a suspect the 2005 disappearance of @entity26 teen @entity24 in @entity27			1
the prison , built in the 1980s to house national terrorists , is surrounded by dirt roads in a poor neighborhood in the outskirts of @entity0			1
it is one of the country 's most technologically advanced prisons			0
visitors must consent to a full body scan in order to enter the jail			0
we had to cross several gated perimeters before we arrived at one of the twelve inmate pavilions			0
inmates are housed according to their crimes and every inmate group has a leader who serves as a liaison between the inmates and jail officials			0
we were able to speak freely to inmates in one pavilion used to house inmates accused of drug crimes			0
they told us that rehabilitation is a big part of their prison life			1
we were shown several workshops that teach skills including arts and crafts , baking , culinary arts , carpentry , shoe making and computer skills			0
prison officials say these inmates have passed psychological exams and have earned the benefit of participating in these specialty workshops			1
inmate @entity75 told us he would go crazy if it was n't for the opportunity to be in the art and crafts workshop			0
he has been in prison for 27 months and has yet to stand trial			1
the last time he saw a judge was 14 months ago , he says			0
inmates are rewarded for good behavior as a way for authorities to keep the peace amongst the population			0
as we made our way through the different pavilions and speak to a group of men charged for terrorism we are constantly surrounded by about a dozen guards			0
they will accompany us for the duration of our 3 hour visit			0
it is a large amount of security considering that only fifty unarmed guards watch over almost 1600 inmates on a daily basis			2
overpopulation is a big problem at @entity6			1
the jail was built to house only 700 inmates , with two inmates per cell but in fact , four to six inmates now occupy most cells , authorities said			2
we asked to see the living quarters but authorities would not allow it citing security concerns			2
we were able to see was @entity19 's cell			1
prison officials took us after he was escorted out			2
we caught a glimpse of him through the fence as guards led him from the protective custody unit			0
he wore an orange shirt and light colored pants			0
he is kept in a solitary cell the size of a walk - in closet			2
it was equipped with a cot covered with a thin mattress and a blanket made from @entity1 textiles			1
the mattress was probably about six inches thick , and it was covered with a sheet			0
it seemed comfortable enough to the touch			0
on top of the bed were several books , most of them in @entity144			2
the books included a @entity145 and other religious works			1
beneath the books were some magazines			2
also on top of the bed were two unopened boxes of what looked like toothpaste			1
there were hooks on the walls for clothes			0
hanging on one was the red knit jacket van der @entity19 has worn on television			1
there was a hole in the floor for a toilet and a concrete sink with running water			0
the cell did n't seem cold			2
the floor of the cell was covered with shiny synthetic wood			2
@entity19 does not eat with the other inmates , prison officials said			1
his meals are prepared separately for him for security reasons			1
he eats what the prison staff eats			1
we are told he has met with a criminal defense attorney , @entity176			0
outside his cell complex we bump into pastoral superintended @entity179 , who said he had just met with @entity19 to offer him spiritual advice			1
he could not provide us with any details , citing confidentiality agreements			0
jail director @entity183 told us his goal is to eventually introduce @entity19 into the general population			1
inmate @entity75 said @entity19 has nothing to worry about since many at @entity6 have been accused of similar crimes			1
" he is one of us " he said .			0

@entity19 has his own cell at the @entity6 prison in @entity0 , @entity1
he eats the same food as the prison staff for security reasons
a @entity145 , some boxes of toothpaste , and magazines were on his bed
in @entity202 toured the prison and received access to the cell
