@entity2 -- " murderer , " one e-mail 's subject line said			0
" please shoot yourself , you racist piece of sh - t , " read the body of another e-mail			0
" you killed an unarmed teen that you stalked			0
" and several dictated the same , succinct line : " hope you die in prison			0
" these venom - drenched words are just a smattering of at least 400 e-mails and letters , all sent to @entity19 over the past 10 months			1
@entity19 , 29 , has yet to read the vast majority of these letters ; they are retained by his legal counsel in @entity2			1
his attorneys provided them exclusively to @entity3 , omitting the senders ' names to protect their identities			1
the majority are either neutral or compassionate , offering moral support and financial contributions to help with @entity19 's mounting bills			1
the supportive letters often blame the media for his woes and offer encouragement for the road ahead			0
@entity40 's parents ready to let jury decide fate of son 's killer some applaud his lawsuit against @entity47 over the altering the recording of his police call , allegedly to " create the myth that @entity19 was a racist and predatory villain			1
" other missives -- many packed with vitriol and anger -- provide a glimpse into the emotion that overcame the nation when @entity19 fatally shot @entity40 , a black teen , in @entity59 , @entity60 , exactly one year ago			1
like the friendly letters , there are recurring themes : condemnation of @entity19 's conduct that night , mocking the website he established to collect donations for the legal defense and even ridiculing the physical appearances of him and his wife , @entity70			1
@entity19 is vilified as a predator in these letters , while @entity40 is portrayed as a " baby " or " child			1
" dozens are riddled with profanity and crude anatomical references			0
the outrage erupted when @entity59 police at first declined to make an arrest in the shooting			1
the fury mushroomed as national networks picked up the story			0
at first , it seemed fairly black and white : @entity40 , an unarmed 17 - year - old , was walking to the home of his father 's fiancee after a trip to the store for candy and tea when @entity19 , the neighborhood watchman , saw him and called @entity59 police 's nonemergency line			1
@entity19 described @entity40 as a " suspicious guy			1
" the dispatcher told @entity19 not to follow the teen -- whether he did is still in dispute -- but the two later encountered each other			1
@entity19 fired his weapon , and a bullet to @entity40 's chest ended the youngster 's life			1
police would later explain that the dispatcher 's imperative was " not a lawful order that mr. @entity19 would be required to follow			2
" it would turn out to be a more complicated incident altogether , one whose details have yet to emerge completely			0
many of the letters to @entity19 indicate a rush to judgment that many in the nation seemed to embrace in the weeks after the shooting			1
" bottom line is u followed him and got out of your car so it 's 100 % your fault , " one sender alleged			0
5 things you might have missed about the @entity19 saga " you should n't have continued to pursue him after you were clearly told by the emergency operator to stop following him , " another said			2
despite his myriad detractors , @entity19 had his supporters as well , and they seemed to sympathize with the plight of a man so concerned about neighborhood break - ins that he bought a gun and dog and donned the mantle of neighborhood watchman			2
" his character proves he is a good person and put in charge of trying to keep homes safe , " one of his supporters said in a handwritten letter			0
though @entity19 is half @entity149 and grew up in a mixed - race family , many of his opponents believed his actions were the product of racial profiling , while others felt the incident was being used to stoke racial tensions			2
those sentiments , too , are apparent in the letters " you are a racist bastard , who targeted an innocent black kid , simply because he was black , " one note read			0
" you murder a child because of the color of his skin , " said another			1
in contrast , others saw the racial controversy as a ginned - up conspiracy to condemn @entity19 and made references to " the race - baiting media " and " threats by the black community and their leaders			2
" " black people take every opportunity to claim they 've been wronged , " said one letter , while another encouraged @entity19 to keep his head high : " do n't let the damn blacks hold you back			1
" much of the correspondence @entity19 received traces the curves of the evolving narrative since february 26 , 2012 , as previously obscured facts were brought to light and @entity19 began to tell his side of the story			2
for instance , a friend who was on the phone with @entity40 at the time told authorities the teen told her he was being followed			1
@entity19 has since said he was n't pursuing @entity40			1
rather , he was trying to determine a good street address to give to police			0
another example is the shooting itself			0
while @entity19 's opponents say he had no cause to shoot @entity40 , 911 calls indicate there was a struggle that was loud enough to alert neighbors in the townhome community			1
opinion : one year later , we remember @entity40 someone is heard shouting for help -- accounts vary as to who -- then , on one of the calls , a gunshot is heard			1
@entity19 said it was @entity40 who attacked him , decking him with a punch to the nose before slamming his head repeatedly into the sidewalk			1
the first images released of @entity19 -- from a grainy surveillance video -- did n't seem to support the assertion			1
he seemed clean , uninjured even , many said			0
but color photos released later -- one of the back of @entity19 's skull streaked in blood and another showing @entity19 's swollen nose , blood smeared across his mustache and lip -- raised the possibility he may have been attacked			1
" if people claim you attacked and held him down and shot him you would n't be injured but you are			0
that proves to me your story makes more sense , " read an e-mail from one supporter			0
other observers were not convinced			0
" your bloody nose picture only shows that @entity40 was fighting for his life against an armed man , " a retired @entity60 police officer wrote			2
claiming self - defense , @entity19 was n't arrested immediately			2
that decision by local police prompted many protests			0
thousands rallied and walked out of schools			0
a specially appointed prosecutor decided to charge @entity19 with second - degree murder in april , more than six weeks after the shooting , and the @entity59 city manager axed police chief @entity257 in june			1
now , his defense team is faced with the task of convincing @entity261 judge @entity260 that @entity19 feared for his life			2
many letters to @entity19 indicate there are plenty of people who have already made up their minds			1
" i believe you did what you needed to do i do n't do n't ( sic ) think you were wrong you were trying to protect yourself , " read an e-mail			2
" " the fact is that @entity40 physically assaulted another human being , and in a civilized society , you are n't allowed to do that , " said another supporter			2
@entity60 task force : keep ' stand your ground ' other letters , however , cast @entity19 as a coward who shot a teen after picking a fight with him			1
" you shot trayvon when you were losing to ( sic ) fight that you started ! " one such e-mail chastised @entity19			1
it continued , " think about your nieces and nephews what if they were being followed by a strange male and turned to confront them , got in a fight with them got killed and the man said it was self - defense			0
may @entity298 bless your soul , if you ca n't see what you did was wrong			0
" @entity301 will decide in april whether @entity19 can avoid prosecution during an immunity hearing dealing with @entity60 's now - controversial stand - your - ground law			2
the law states that people can use deadly force to defend themselves if they believe they are threatened with death or serious bodily harm			0
though @entity40 's supporters question how the law can be invoked under the circumstances in this case , there are those who believe the neighborhood watchman handled himself appropriately			2
" thank you for standing your ground , " one note said			0
if @entity301 agrees with the stand - your - ground claim , @entity19 's scheduled june trial will be called off			2
if she rules against it , the trial will proceed			0
while many people have steadfast opinions about what happened the night @entity40 was killed , there are those who feel the situation is still unclear			2
" i do n't know what actually happened between the two of them			0
in my ' gut , ' i feel it was probably a tragic accident and that they were both in the wrong place at the wrong time , " read a handwritten letter			1
another stated , " i do not think that you are a racist , just a loose cannon from the 19th century			0
... i do not hate you or like you , i am pretty much neutral			0
" if @entity301 sends the case to trial , the next stage will be jury selection			0
if these last few letters are any indication , there may still be at least a few impartial onlookers amid a sea of passionate opinions .			0
