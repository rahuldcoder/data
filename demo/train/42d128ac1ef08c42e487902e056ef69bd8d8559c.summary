after hours of debate on the massive government spending package , the @entity0 adjourned until saturday , pushing a fight that dominated @entity4 for days into the weekend			1
the @entity0 is expected to vote monday on the $ 1.1 trillion package , which has already passed the @entity6 , sens. @entity7 and @entity8 said late friday			1
members from both parties in the @entity0 are trying to make last - minute changes to the bill			1
senate majority leader @entity13 made a procedural move friday that would set up a vote on final passage in the @entity0 no later than monday			2
in a surprise development , the @entity0 recessed until saturday , when it is expected to approve a five - day continuing resolution to keep the government operating until the bill is completed			1
@entity13 tried to get unanimous consent for an adjournment until monday when there would be enough votes to end the filibuster , but sen. @entity25 , @entity26 , objected because @entity13 would not guarantee a vote on an amendment dealing with immigration funding			0
@entity13 then announced to an almost empty chamber that the @entity0 will be in session beginning at noon saturday			2
it 's unclear whether both sides will speed things up enough saturday for a vote on the spending package			2
two votes are expected monday : a procedural vote to overcome the filibuster and end debate on the bill , and a second one on the final passage			0
the @entity0 was facing a saturday deadline to approve the spending bill and avert a government shutdown , but that was pushed back			1
earlier friday , the @entity6 approved a five - day stopgap bill to make sure the government was continually funded			1
the chamber has been sifting through many of the same arguments that tied up the @entity6 on thursday , when disagreements over immigration and provisions related to @entity54 and campaign finance nearly derailed the bill			0
@entity0 lawmakers wanted votes on amendments that would address those issues			1
' using every tool available ' sen. @entity61 , @entity62 , and sen. @entity63 , @entity64 , filed an amendment that would strip a provision that softens financial regulations on banks from the spending bill			1
" @entity4 should not put taxpayers on the hook for another bailout , and this giveaway that was drafted by @entity76 lobbyists has no place in a critical government funding bill , " @entity70 said			0
meanwhile , sen. @entity79 , @entity80 , a chief critic of president @entity82 's recent executive action on immigration , also said he wanted a vote to block those actions			0
" i think it is critical that the @entity0 have the opportunity to have a clear up or down vote on funding president @entity82 's illegal executive amnesty , " he told reporters			0
" i am using every tool available to help bring about that vote			0
" but by making the procedural move , @entity13 prevented those amendments from being considered			0
amendment votes could have been risky because if either measure passed , the spending bill would have to go back to the @entity6 to be voted on again			1
while the @entity6 is technically in session , most members have left @entity101 until the new @entity4 convenes in early january			0
a day after his administration scrambled to save the bill after it appeared it might be defeated in the @entity6 , the president said he was pulling for it in the @entity0			2
" i 'm glad it passed the @entity6 and am hopeful that it will pass the @entity0 , " he said .			0
