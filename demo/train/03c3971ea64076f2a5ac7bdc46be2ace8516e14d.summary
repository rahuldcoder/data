the 19 - year - old fast bowler was forbidden from taking part in all forms of cricket for five years in february after being found guilty of deliberately bowling no balls in the spot - fixing scandal that engulfed @entity16 's series with @entity9 last year			1
@entity1 insisted that he was told his appearance for @entity19 village side @entity18 would not violate his ban because it was a friendly match			1
but the @entity22 have confirmed to @entity0 that they will be investigating the incident and could mete out further punishment			2
@entity25 , the @entity22 's @entity26 , said , " we are investigating and awaiting the details			1

what might happen next is a hypothetical question at this stage			0
" @entity39 newspaper @entity38 reported wednesday that @entity1 played in the game against @entity41 's and took four wickets before scoring 60 runs with the bat			1
he is said to have left before the end of the match			2
two of @entity1 's teammates , former @entity16 captain @entity47 and bowler @entity49 were also banned by the @entity22 , for ten and seven years respectively , for their part in the gambling ring			1
quotes from @entity1 appeared on @entity2 cricket web site @entity54 on which he is reported to have said : " i was informed by club representatives before the game that it was a friendly match , being played on a privately owned cricket ground			1
" i asked the club representatives if the match fell under the jurisdiction of the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) and they informed me that the match did not			1
" i spoke to several club representatives about the issue , and they all told me that it was a friendly match and therefore would not contravene my ban from the @entity22			1
i would not be stupid enough to knowingly play in a match that i knew would contravene my ban			2
" wherever i am going to play cricket , the world will know about it			0
i would not be stupid enough to play in a match where i knew that i would be taking a risk			0
" meanwhile , the @entity22 confirmed @entity9 wicketkeeper @entity73 has been " reprimanded " for smashing a window at @entity75 after being run out during the second test match with @entity77			1

prior apologized immediately , and the @entity22 acknowledged that the incident was " purely accidental and without malice , " though they could still fine the player up to 50 percent of his match fee			2
@entity9 team director @entity90 saw the incident and told the @entity9 's official web site : " there was no real malicious intent at all			2
he was a little frustrated and shoved his bat in the corner , and it knocked around and bounced off one or two other bats and hit the pane of glass			0
" it was a freak accident but definitely an accident			0
it is a shame that people will think anything other than that			0
it is not a major incident by any stretch of the imagination , and everybody should put it behind them really			0
