-- on may 4 , the day @entity1 turned 26 , the multi-platinum singer tweeted , " bye bye 25 ... see you again later in the year			1
" the tweet seemed to suggest that @entity1 's much - anticipated follow - up to " 21 " would be arriving at some point in 2014			2
however , according to the @entity7 , that is no longer the case			0
a financial report from @entity1 's label @entity11 reveals that there are no plans to drop an album from the " @entity16 " singer in 2014			1
@entity1 's ' 21 ' becomes first album to sell over 3 million digital copies the good news is that @entity11 made $ 15 million net profit this year , but further down in the report , which the label sent to regulators today , they added this sobering note : " there will not be a further new release by @entity1 during 2014 and consequently there will be a fall in @entity11 's turnover and profits			1
nevertheless , the directors are confident that by pursuing management policies ... @entity11 will continue to achieve success with other artists			0
" in the report , the label notes that the singer 's back catalogue accounted for a " significant proportion of the sales and profit " during 2013			0
@entity1 's toddler son wins damages from paparazzi photos " 21 " sold more than 25 million copies worldwide , so the quiet revelation that 2014 will be @entity48 comes as an equally disappointing update to both @entity11 's distributor @entity50 and the singer 's fans			2
in a holiday season set to feature big album releases from @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and possibly @entity59 , @entity1 's new lp was expected to be the marquee event and a dire shot in the arm for a music industry that has endured record low sales this year			1
however , as we enter the fourth quarter of 2014 , @entity1 had n't made any announcements -- she has n't even tweeted since july -- or rolled out any new singles , which implied that the tentatively titled " 25 " might have to wait until " 26			2
