-- is this just a normal year , or is the southwest monsoon acting more aggressively than normal ? the 2011 tropical cyclone season in the west @entity4 has been about average , not significantly above or below usual events			1
we did have a few consecutive storms that made landfall in the @entity10 and other parts of @entity12 in late september and early october , such as @entity13 , @entity14 , and @entity15 -- but that had more to do with a steering pattern caused by high pressure over the @entity4 , not the monsoon			1
the remnants of these storms did make their way farther into @entity12 , which likely enhanced the monsoon trough , thus leading to higher than average rainfall in countries such as @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28			1
rainfall in most of @entity25 is running 15 % to 25 % above average for the year ( with a vast majority of that rain coming in the monsoon months of may to october )			2
what exactly is the southwest monsoon ? when does it start , end , and how is it generated ? the southwest monsoon occurs during the northern hemisphere summer , and is caused by the land masses of the @entity40 subcontinent and @entity12 heating up faster than the @entity41			1
this creates an influx of cooler , moisture - laden air from the ocean over the land			0
the southwest monsoon generally begins in mid-may and ends in late october / early november , though start and end times vary based on location			1
@entity40 , for example , has a southwest monsoon season that begins june 1 and ends september 30			1
which countries are most affected by this monsoon ? @entity40 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity25 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity26 , @entity10 , and @entity57 are all affected in a significant way			2
@entity40 is largely considered the most " affected , " since it has the most - consistent monsoon season and depends the most on the rains of the monsoon for their life - sustaining agriculture			2
some areas in @entity12 are recording above - average precipitation , such as in @entity66 which has so far received 58 % more rainfall than usual this year			2
why is the monsoon bringing more intense weather than usual in 2011 ? some monsoons are more active than others , and there can be a myriad of reasons for this			2
i think the monsoon rainfall was enhanced in september by numerous tropical systems interacting with the monsoon trough			1
but other reasons could be much more complicated			0
there could be interactions with other large - scale weather and climate variables , such as @entity85 or @entity86 ( in the case of this summer , @entity86 was in place , and this does normally lead to higher than average precipitation in @entity12 )			1
sea - surface temperatures that are slightly above or below average can also lead to a variation in monsoon rainfall			1
scientists will need to look into how all of these potential ingredients came together to produce these flooding rains			0
also , the monsoon can be very active in one region , while being relatively inactive in another			0
it just so happens that for the last several weeks , the monsoon trough has been very active over central @entity25 ( in and around @entity66 ) , but other areas of the country have seen below average rainfall			1
in general are @entity107 summer monsoons becoming more destructive , or is it just cyclical ? i believe it is just cyclical , and as mentioned above , depends on a wide variety of factors			0
the consequences , however , could be getting worse as populations and cities grow along the major rivers , which see rapid and intense rises during monsoon floods			0
is there anything that @entity12 can do to help alleviate higher than usual rainfall ? better city planning and flood prevention strategies would be the biggest thing			0
monsoon floods have always occurred , and these rivers naturally flood their banks occasionally ( which is what makes the land in these areas so fertile )			0
but if people continue to build more in these vulnerable areas , natural disasters like floods will continue to become more frequent			0
