@entity0 -- organizers of a @entity4 tribute concert , supported by the late pop star 's mother and four siblings , promise they will announce " an incredible line - up very soon " that will include " some of the greatest names in music			1
" promoters missed their deadline of thursday to name the performers for the october 8 show , forcing them to put registration for tickets to the @entity18 , @entity19 , concert on hold			1
" the registration period was put on hold because we want people to know who they are registering to see , " @entity22 , the head of the @entity24 company promoting the concert , said in a message posted online friday			2
the plan had been to announce the acts over a 10 - day period following the july 25 news conference in which @entity4 brothers @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 , sister @entity39 and family matriarch @entity41 endorsed the " @entity42 : the @entity43			1
" the @entity45 chief promised fans friday the process would get on track			0
" between now and october we will be continuing to add names to the line - up so more announcements will follow , " @entity22 said			0
" fans of @entity4 's music will get the concert they 've been waiting for			1
" " some of the greatest names in music are already signed , and more are trying to shuffle other commitments to come on board , " a statement posted friday on the concert website said			2
plans for the show appeared to be in disarray thursday when tickets were to go on sale , but instead of providing a link for purchases the promoter 's website asked fans to " please standby for further announcements			2
" the problems started soon after the family announced the " @entity42 : the @entity43 " at the @entity75 on july 25			0
@entity39 said it was " something that 's spectacular " while the @entity78 ' mother called it " a show fit for a king			2
" " if my son were here today , he would feel the same way , " @entity41 said			0
" i know my brother would be very , very proud to see all the artists that he admired and respected so much coming together for this event , " @entity37 said			0
but an hour later , @entity89 and @entity90 , the only brothers not at the news conference , issued a sharply worded statement that reflected a deep division within the @entity93 over the show			1
" we want to make clear that this does not reflect the position of the entire family , " the two brothers said in a joint statement			0
" while we wholeheartedly support the spirit of a tribute that honors our brother , we find it impossible to support an event that is due to take place during the criminal trial surrounding @entity4 's death			1
" the involuntary manslaughter trial of @entity4 's physician , dr. @entity109 , begins in september and is expected to continue into october			1
while @entity22 had hinted it could include a @entity4 brothers reunion , the statement from @entity89 and @entity90 made it clear that would not happen			1
" in light of this , we feel it is inappropriate to be involved with such an ill - timed event and its promoter , @entity120 , " @entity90 and @entity114 said			2
their statement said the idea of the october concert was presented to the entire family in april " as an idea already in its advanced stages			0
" the decision to go ahead with it " disrespects opinions and wishes expressed in the strongest terms " by some members of the @entity93 , they said			0
the @entity133 agreed with the two brothers , issuing a similar statement			0
" we share their concerns that this concert is taking place at a most inappropriate time when everyone 's care and attention should be focused on the matter of justice			0
we believe that , as stated by @entity89 and @entity90 , the most important tribute we can give to @entity4 at this time is to seek justice in his name			1
" @entity4 fans posted messages on the concert 's @entity150 page questioning ticket prices and the process for buying them			1
fans must place bids for a chance to buy a ticket			0
the higher their pledge to a charity , the better their chances of getting a good seat			0
" the ticket system is so bad ! ! the higher you bid the better seats you get ? ? not every @entity4 fan is rich ! ! ! " one fan posted on the " @entity169 " @entity150 page thursday			2
the october 8 show , in the @entity171 in @entity18 , which seats 75,000 people , would be at least four hours long , @entity22 said			1
in addition to the other problems surrounding the event , a spokesman for @entity4 's estate said last week that the promoters never sought or obtained permission from the estate 's executors to use late pop singer 's name or image			1
" the estate has not been contacted and is not involved with @entity45 in the @entity188 tribute concert announced today , " spokesman @entity185 told @entity1 .			0

" fans of @entity4 's music will get the concert they 've been waiting for , " promoter says
ticket sales are on hold until concert acts are announced
@entity4 's mother , three brothers and a sister endorsed the october 8 show in @entity19
@entity89 and @entity90 *objected* because the trial of @entity4 's doctor will be under way
