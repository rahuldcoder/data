-- on july 25th , 1965 , @entity1 walked onstage at the @entity2 , plugged in his 1964 sunburst @entity3 and tore through a scorching three - song set			1
it was a crucial turning point in his career , and it quickly became rock & roll legend -- the moment when @entity1 transformed from a protest folkie to a rebel genius			1
but the guitar @entity1 played on that mythic afternoon went missing for the next 47 years -- until recently , when a team of @entity15 researchers told @entity17 resident @entity16 that she had it in her home			1
@entity16 's late father , @entity19 , was a private pilot who worked for @entity1 's manager , @entity20 , in the mid- 1960s			1
" after one flight , my father saw there were three guitars left on the plane , " she says			2
he contacted the company a few times about picking the guitars up , but nobody ever got back to him			2
" last fall , @entity16 asked @entity15 's history detectives to help verify her find			1
the 1964 @entity3 came with 13 pages of typed and handwritten song lyrics tucked inside its guitar case -- but host @entity36 was skeptical at first			1
" it 's so important , historically and culturally , that i could n't have imagined @entity1 would have just left it on an airplane , " he says			1
in fact , @entity1 says that 's not what happened			1
" @entity1 has possession of the electric guitar he played at the @entity2 in 1965 , " his attorney , @entity43 , said in a statement			1
" he did own several other @entity3 guitars that were stolen from him around that time , as were some handwritten lyrics			0
" but experts make a strong case that the guitar in question is the same one @entity1 played at the festival in 1965			1
vintage - instrument specialist @entity55 was convinced after @entity15 asked him to compare it to close - up color photos from @entity57			0
" the more i looked , the more they matched , " @entity55 says			0
" the rosewood fingerboard has distinct lighter strips			0
wood grain is like a fingerprint			0
i 'm 99.9 percent sure it 's the guitar -- my credibility is on the line here			2
" history detectives also called in @entity1 memorabilia collector @entity67 , who often helps auction houses authenticate items for sale			1
' a vast percentage of the stuff i get shown is n't real , ' he says			0
' by nature , i 'm a defeatist			0
but this was obviously real			0
' the lyrics that came with the guitar are evocative fragments : " there 's bullets in my eyes but i still can see / it 's just these headaches that are killing me			2
" a handful of lines appeared on tracks that @entity1 recorded for @entity88 in 1965 and 1966			2
" i own a manuscript of ' @entity91 , ' and there 's this line , ' the six white horses , ' " @entity89 says			0
" in one of these manuscripts , @entity1 had written ' six flying horses , ' and then above ' flying ' he 'd written ' white ' and ' the			2
' it was obvious the same person had written both of them			0
" other fragments within the lyrics wound up on " @entity88 , " an early version of the @entity88 song " @entity106			0
" the episode of @entity66 ( which also includes a brief interview with this reporter ) airs on @entity15 tuesday july 17th at 9:00 pm est. if it 's real , the guitar is estimated to be worth as much as $ 1 million -- but does @entity16 legally own it ? maybe not			1
" it 's his guitar until he makes an affirmative act to give it to someone else or sell it , " says lawyer @entity112 , who represents artists including @entity116			2
" i think if they put it up to auction , @entity1 has a claim to the proceeds			2
if he finds out beforehand , he might be able to stop from from doing it			0
" in 2005 , @entity16 wrote to @entity1 's management and requested that he waive any claim to the guitar			1
@entity1 's team declined , and said that the guitar should be returned			1
for now , @entity16 is keeping the guitar in a secure , climate - controlled environment ; she has not decided whether to sell it			1
" i have to discuss it more with my husband , " she says			0
" things have crossed my mind			0
