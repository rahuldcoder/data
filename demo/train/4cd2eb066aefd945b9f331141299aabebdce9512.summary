@entity0 -- the @entity6 administration is putting the final touches on a security assistance package totaling as much as $ 2 billion over five years to help @entity9 fight extremists on its border with @entity12 , senior @entity3 officials and diplomatic sources tell @entity1			1
the aid is expected to be announced later this week when @entity9 officials are in @entity0 to hold high - level talks			1
the package aims to address @entity9 's insistence it does not have the capability to go after terrorists , and needs more support from the @entity3 , the sources said			1
the aid will help the @entity9 purchase helicopters , weapons systems and equipment to intercept communications			2
it falls under the @entity3 ' @entity28 ( @entity28 ) program , which provides grants and loans to countries to purchase weapons and defense equipment produced in the @entity3			0
it also includes more counterinsurgency assistance to @entity9 troops and a program allowing members of the @entity9 military to study at @entity3 war colleges			2
the $ 2 billion package is on top of billions of dollars the @entity3 already gives @entity9 in military aid and a $ 7.5 billion aid package over five years in non-military counter-terrorism assistance approved by @entity46 last year			1
" they key is to beef up their ability to go after militants , it ca n't be diverted to other threats , " one senior @entity3 official said			2
@entity9 has long claimed its military is geared toward defending itself against threats from countries like @entity58 , and does not have the kind of equipment it needs to fight insurgents			2
@entity3 officials said they recognize @entity9 's current military hardware is not perfectly suited toward such operations , but made clear the new aid must be directed toward fighting extremists , rather than @entity58 " we recognize they need different kinds of capacities and more of them to handle extremists form within their own border , " one official said			1
" they do need more capacity and the kinds of capabilities that are geared toward fighting extremists , rather than a major land conflict			2
" @entity3 officials acknowledge the @entity9 military is stretched thin since this summer 's devastating floods , and has had to divert resources from the fight against extremists to conduct relief efforts			1
they hope the new security assistance will address the military 's resource limitations so they can redouble efforts to go after militants			0
" there is an expectation with that capacity comes a greater effort , " a senior official said			1
the aid comes on the heels of a @entity101 report sent to @entity46 earlier this month which uses unusually tough language to suggest the ally is not doing nearly enough to confront the @entity104 and @entity105 , despite repeated @entity6 administration claims in public that @entity9 is working hard to crack down on militants the @entity101 assessment , obtained by @entity1 , is particularly tough on @entity9 's inability to make gains in @entity111 , where many analysts believe key @entity105 leaders have gained a safe haven to use as a base to plot terror attacks against @entity118 targets			2
the report notes that from march to june , the @entity9 military " continued to avoid military engagements that would put it in direct conflict with @entity12 @entity104 or [ @entity105 ] forces in @entity124			1
this is as much a political choice as it is a reflection of an under - resourced military prioritizing its targets			0
" " the capacity issue is very real , " another senior official said			1
" it 's not like they could just go into @entity124 if they wanted to and succeed			0
there is an issue of political will but the capacity issue remains extremely important			0
" the official said the multi-year assistance package is designed to provide the @entity9 with " an issue of predictability and consistency " in @entity3 military assistance , which has typically been done on a year - to - year basis			1
@entity9 has long voiced concerns the @entity3 is not going to remain engaged with the region over the long term			2
" we need to demonstrate we are in it for more than six months to a year			0
this offers a time horizon and allows them to chill out about that , " the official said			0
even with the harsh @entity101 report , @entity3 officials do acknowledge that @entity9 has made some progress in combating terrorism , noting the country has suffered thousands of casualties as a result of its campaign against extremists in its tribal areas bordering @entity12			1
suspected @entity3 drone strikes have also increased in @entity9 , killing dozens of high - level militants in the tribal areas			0
although the @entity3 does not comment on drone strikes , @entity9 officials have said they could not be done without @entity9 cooperation			1
while in @entity9 in july , secretary of state @entity170 said the @entity9 government has become " very serious " about fighting the violent extremist organizations within its borders			0
at the time , @entity174 alluded to the security assistance being announced this week , while telling reporters the @entity3 was " working on a multi-year package with the @entity9			1
" @entity9 foreign minister @entity178 and @entity9 's military chief , gen. @entity179 , are leading a @entity9 delegation arriving tuesday for the @entity3 - @entity181 , three days of meetings starting wednesday with @entity174 , defense secretary @entity182 and adm. @entity183 , chairman of the @entity184			0
the talks address all facets of the relationship between @entity0 and @entity189 , but counterterrorism cooperation will be a major aspect of the talks			0
" @entity9 has taken aggressive action within its borders			0
but clearly , this is an ongoing threat and more needs to be done , " @entity195 spokesman @entity194 said monday			0
" that will be among the issues talked about			0

the aid package could total as much as $ 2 billion
an *announcement* is expected when @entity9 officials are in @entity0 this week
the aid is to help @entity9 fight extremists on its border with @entity12
