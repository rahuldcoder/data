@entity0 -- in a major blow to the @entity6 leadership , the @entity3 @entity2 on wednesday defeated a temporary spending measure that would have required spending cuts to offset additional money for federal disaster relief efforts			1
the vote was 195 - 230 , with 48 republicans joining all but a handful of minority @entity14 in opposing the short - term spending plan that would keep the government funded for seven weeks after the end of the fiscal year on september 30			1
after the result , @entity2 @entity6 leaders met in speaker @entity23 's office to decide if they would revise the measure and hold another vote on thursday			1
options under consideration included removing or changing the spending offsets opposed by @entity14 , or reducing the total amount of spending to appease conservative @entity31			1
at issue was a short - term bill to fund government agencies through november 18 that would allocate fewer resources to the @entity36 and the @entity37 for disaster response than the @entity14 - led @entity39 approved last week			1
additional funds are needed because of recent major floods from @entity42 and @entity43 along the @entity44 , and wildfires in @entity46 that required emergency responses exceeding the amount the agencies have left in their coffers to support recovery and rebuilding efforts			2
the @entity2 measure included a total of $ 3.6 billion in disaster relief money -- $ 1 billion in emergency funds available when the bill is enacted and another $ 2.6 billion to be budgeted for those federal response agencies for the 2012 fiscal year that begins october 1			2
in addition , @entity2 @entity6 leaders are insisting that the $ 1 billion in immediate disaster funding be offset with $ 1.5 billion in cuts to a loan program that helps automakers retool their operations to make more fuel - efficient cars			1
democrats objected to cutting spending for disaster funding , calling it unprecedented and politicizing emergency relief for @entity3			2
conservative republicans , including @entity2 majority leader @entity73 of @entity74 , argued that the nation 's expanding deficits require as much spending restraint as possible			2
earlier this month , president @entity78 asked @entity79 for a total of $ 5.1 billion in additional disaster aid --- $ 500 million of which was for immediate relief			0
last week , the @entity39 bill that passed with bipartisan support included $ 6.9 billion for @entity36 and other federal agencies for immediate disaster relief and for relief in 2012			0
the @entity39 version required no spending offsets			0
the impasse could leave the government without funding after september 30 if @entity79 fails to authorize further spending , which would cause a partial shutdown			0
@entity73 , however , said no shutdown would occur			0
" suffice it to say there 's not going to be a shutdown , " @entity73 told reporters			0
" i think everybody needs to relax			0
we 're trying to affect change in a way that we spend taxpayer dollars - that 's what this whole thing is about			0
no one is denying anyone disaster aid if they need it , and we 're trying to be responsible and to do the right thing			0
" meanwhile , rep. @entity114 of @entity115 , the chamber 's no. 2 @entity116 , said his party would support the measure if the offset provision was removed			1
" they put something in that was clearly , we think , a job killer , " @entity114 said of the offset that would eliminate the loan program for manufacturing fuel - efficient vehicles			1
during floor debate on the measure , @entity114 and other @entity14 complained that any kind of offset would be unprecedented for emergency funding to help @entity3 in need			1
" even if they had the best offset in the world , i still think it 's wrong " to require equivalent spending cuts when getting money to disaster victims , said @entity2 minority leader @entity130 , @entity131			2
to @entity114 , the defeat of the @entity6 measure " says that we are continuing to struggle to do things in a bipartisan fashion			1
" if @entity31 " expect our votes , they have to work with us , " he said			2
" they ca n't just give us something and say ... their way or the highway			0
" -- @entity1 's @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152 contributed to this report .			0

new : remove the offset and @entity14 will support it , rep. @entity114 says
