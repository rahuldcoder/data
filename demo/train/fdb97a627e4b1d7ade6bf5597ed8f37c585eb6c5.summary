-- @entity2 has started warning users when it thinks they may be targets of government - sponsored hackers , the internet giant announced			1
users whose accounts are compromised get a message at the top of their browser saying : " warning : we believe state - sponsored attackers may be attempting to compromise your account or computer			0
" users in @entity17 have already begun getting the message , said one former journalist who used to work in @entity19			1
" i got this warning three times , " said @entity20 , who asked to be identified only by her first name for security reasons			0
concerned that the warning itself was an attempt to hack her account , she posted a question in a closed @entity2 group , asking if anyone else got the message			2
" so far about 10 of us have received the same message , some in @entity17 , some in @entity36 , " she said			2
the group has about 200 members , she said			0
" some people are not even that surprised because they have suspicious followers on @entity40 or @entity2 , " she said			2
but @entity20 said she was startled to find out she was apparently a target because she is not a journalist anymore			0
" i left this industry about three years ago , in 2009 , and left @entity19			0
i was really surprised that i was still a target , " she said			0
@entity2 did not accuse @entity17 of being behind the hacking , but the company has been at odds with @entity19 in the past over @entity17 attempts to control internet use			1
@entity2 declined to say how it could tell that governments were behind the hacking attempts			1
" we ca n't go into the details without giving away information that would be helpful to these bad actors , " @entity53 , @entity2 security engineering vice president , said tuesday in a post on the company 's website			1
" but our detailed analysis -- as well as victim reports -- strongly suggest the involvement of states or groups that are state - sponsored , " he said			0
getting the warning does not mean a user 's account has been hacked , the company said , but that @entity2 believes the account has been a target of phishing , malware or other hacking tools			1
@entity2 advises users who get the message to strengthen passwords and update software			1
it also encourages users to be careful about where they enter their passwords .			0
