while there are more than 100 types of enteroviruses causing up to 15 million @entity94 infections annually , @entity69 infections occur less commonly , the @entity4 health agency said			1
like other enteroviruses , the respiratory illness appears to spread through close contact with infected people , the agency said			1
" unlike the majority of enteroviruses that cause a clinical disease manifesting as a mild upper respiratory illness , febrile rash illness , or neurologic illness ( such as aseptic meningitis and encephalitis ) , @entity69 has been associated almost exclusively with respiratory disease , " the agency said			1
clusters of the virus have struck @entity234 , @entity235 and the @entity94 from 2008 to 2010 , and the infection caused relatively mild to severe illness , with some intensive care and mechanical ventilation , the health agency said			1
to reduce the risk of infection , individuals should wash hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds , especially after changing diapers , avoid touching eyes , nose and mouth with unwashed hands ; avoid kissing , hugging and sharing cups or eating utensils with people who are sick ; disinfect frequently - touched surfaces such as toys and doorknobs ; and stay home when feeling sick , the @entity4 agency said			2
