-- the @entity1 held on for a 23 - 21 victory over @entity3 saturday in a nail - biting first test in @entity5			1
the opening match of the three - @entity8 series swung on a few key moments and the @entity3 were left to count the cost of two late missed penalties from @entity12			1
his first effort from just 30 meters out went wide of the posts and when presented with another chance from a little further out , @entity12 cruelly slipped as he was making his attempt			2
it left @entity19 's men and the thousands of their supporters who had turned the @entity22 into a sea of red to celebrate a famous victory			0
" it was relief , but we deserved to win that game , " @entity19 told reporters after his side 's narrow triumph			0
they led 13 - 12 at halftime , despite two tries from @entity3 wing @entity35 , who was making a sensational debut just five months after switching to rugby union from rugby league and australian rules football			1
the @entity1 responded with a superb try of their own through @entity44 @entity43 , converted by @entity45 , who also made two further penalties to give the tourists the edge			2
right wing @entity49 went over for a second @entity1 try -- again converted by @entity45 -- early in the second half -- to leave them 20 - 12 ahead			2
@entity52 and replacement @entity12 kicked two penalties to give the @entity3 renewed hope , but the ever accurate @entity45 's boot stretched the lead to 23 - 18			1
but after yet another careless infringement by the @entity1 left @entity12 with the opportunity to close the gap to just two points after his own surging run led to a penalty			1
@entity12 , returning to the @entity3 side , then wasted the two late opportunities to leave his side facing up to defeat			1
" it was very frustrating but i 'm proud of the effort we put in			0
it was a trying circumstance to put themselves in a position to win the game , " @entity3 coach @entity71 said			0
" it was a courageous performance that would stack up alongside any but it was disappointing not to get the reward			0
" his side will take heart from history because the last time the @entity1 toured @entity3 in 2001 , they won the opening test at @entity82 , but lost the series 2 - 1			1
next saturday sees the second test in @entity85 with the third and final match in @entity87 a week later			0
meanwhile , world champions @entity88 beat @entity89 24 - 9 in the the @entity90 of their series in @entity92			0
the @entity88 had won the previous two matches and completed a clean sweep .			0
