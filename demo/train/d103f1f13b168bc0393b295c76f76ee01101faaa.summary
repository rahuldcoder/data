the @entity1 - led @entity0 plans to force a showdown with president @entity3 over the @entity4 as soon as new members take office in january			1
soon - to - be senate majority leader @entity7 , @entity8 , said a measure authorizing construction of the 1,179 - mile @entity11 - to - @entity12 pipeline will be the first bill he 'll schedule for a vote			1
and this project will create well - paying , high - wage jobs for our people and it certainly does enjoy a lot of bipartisan support , " @entity17 told reporters on tuesday			2
if passed , it would force @entity3 to decide whether to veto what could be the first bill the new @entity27 sends to his desk			0
the president has said he wants the decision left in the hands of the @entity33 , which is six years into a review of the project and currently holds final authority because the pipeline would cross international borders @entity17 said he will allow amendments to the bill , which is sponsored by sen. @entity41 , @entity42			0
" i would hope senators on both sides will offer energy - related amendments but there will be no effort to micromanage the amendment process and we 'll move forward and hopefully be able to pass a very important job - creating bill early in the session , " @entity17 said			0
the @entity53 has repeatedly approved a bill that would take the @entity4 decision out of the @entity3 administration 's hands , end the review and give the project the green light			1
the @entity61 - led @entity0 ignored that bill for months , but during the lame - duck session -- with @entity64 chairwoman @entity63 , @entity65 , days away from a runoff election and looking for a way to show her clout -- came up one vote shy of advancing it			1
afterward , @entity17 shrugged off that vote , pledging that the measure would return -- and fare better -- once new lawmakers took office and @entity1 gained control of the @entity0			2
