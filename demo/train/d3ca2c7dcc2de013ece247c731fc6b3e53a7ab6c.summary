@entity0 , @entity1 -- judging by the ferocity with which @entity5 pursued a case of " planned and premeditated " murder against @entity8 at his bail hearing , it would not be unreasonable to assume the state had a strong case			1
from the outset , however , the veracity of the state 's case appeared to dwindle			2
at the bail hearing in february , the then - lead investigator @entity16 crumbled on the stand and had to concede that there was little appreciable evidence gathered to back up the state 's claims			0
worse , he admitted serious breaches of investigation protocol , including the failure to wear protective foot coverings at the crime scene , thereby contaminating certain forensic evidence			0
@entity16 also had to concede that @entity8 ' version of events was not implausible			1
this of course did not help @entity8 in the court of public opinion , as once the state 's sensational claims were made they were immediately disseminated around the world			1
nonetheless , much of the state 's case was castigated by @entity38 in his unusually long bail decision			2
adding to the perception that the state 's case is floundering , on tuesday , rather than presenting their charges to which @entity8 would plead , the state requested a two - month postponement to conduct further investigations			1
this equivocation is in stark contrast to their initial aggression at the bail proceedings			0
the most interesting part of the postponement hearing was the stark warning the magistrate issued to the media and the state to act responsibly and avoid " scandalising the sanctity of justice " through a " trial by media			1

the leaking of these pictures , as well as reports in local newspapers that numerous police cell phones have subsequently been confiscated , adds to the perception that the state is mismanaging this case			2
this begs the question : considering a litany of state missteps and the wild public speculation triggered at the bail proceedings , can @entity8 get a fair trial ? regarding his eventual trial in a court of law , the answer is clearly " yes			1
" @entity1 abandoned trial by jury in 1969			2
@entity8 ' trial will thus be presided over by either a regional magistrate or a high court judge , possibly assisted by assessors			1
judicial officers in @entity1 are highly skilled and experienced and are keenly aware of their responsibility to apply the law in an impartial manner , guided by the evidence presented in court , not discussions occurring outside court			0
this much was inherently acknowledged by the magistrate 's warning yesterday -- he did not focus on the fairness of the trial being damaged but rather the sanctity of the justice system being called into disrepute			2

to many @entity1 @entity112 ' story of triumph over adversity came to symbolize the country 's own story			0
his personal fallibility has thus touched an uncomfortable nerve , reminding the country of its own fallibility , and leading to an angry backlash			0
to this segment of society @entity8 is already guilty of murder -- irrespective of what the evidence ends up revealing			1
the state 's bungles have only served to fuel the determination of @entity8 naysayers : if he is acquitted of murder it will not be put down to the fact that he was telling the truth , but because the state dropped the ball			1
this stance fails to acknowledge that even the best - run cases can result in an acquittal when the facts , as revealed through the evidence gathered , end up supporting an acquittal			0
so where does the evidence currently point ? it is simply too soon to tell			0
what we can ascertain is what evidence is likely to become pivotal			0
for example , the question of whether or not @entity8 was wearing his prosthetics is critical			2
thus the ballistics evidence will be critical			0
the state appears to be relying on a contention that he took the time to put on his prosthetics before firing through the bathroom door			0
this , they claim , shows premeditation			0

the evidence at trial will eventually support one of these versions over the other			0
before that evidence is offered in court , the public can not be clairvoyant -- despite firmly held beliefs either way , we simply do n't yet have enough information to know the truth			1
this is the purpose of a criminal trial , it is essentially a truth - finding mission and the rules of evidence and procedure are set up to enhance this			2
@entity16 , now retired from the police service , would do well to remind himself of this			0
he has given interviews to the media vociferously claiming @entity8 ' guilt and affirming that he will be called at trial to testify for the state			1
with respect , more is required than a policeman 's hunch to convict a person of murder			0
if he is trying to serve the interests of justice , rather than merely grinding an axe , he would do well to stop talking to the media and save his words for court			0
