-- two prisoners have confessed to digging a tunnel that led to the escape of 63 inmates last week , @entity3 's state - run @entity2 news agency reported sunday			1
dozens of suspected @entity11 militants escaped wednesday from a jail in the @entity3 city of @entity14 , a senior security official said			1
an @entity16 official said 63 members of @entity11 had managed to break out of @entity19 prison , according to @entity2			1
he said three inmates were killed , another two were arrested , and a prison guard was killed			0
he asked to remain anonymous because he is not authorized to speak to the media			0
some of the escapees had already been convicted ; others were awaiting trial , the official told @entity2			1
they escaped through a 35 - meter ( 115 - foot ) tunnel , he said			0
witnesses said armed militants began attacking the prison at about 8 a.m. and fired heavy artillery before the escape			0
the prison warden , his deputy and a number of guards have been suspended for questioning , @entity2 said sunday			1
@entity39 , spokesman for @entity3 's largest opposition bloc , @entity40 , said he thinks security officials loyal to the ruling family are responsible for the escape and that the government would create chaos to stay in power			1
@entity3 has been consumed by unrest for months as protesters have demanded an end to president @entity50 's rule			2
in recent weeks , government troops have battled both anti-government tribal forces and @entity54 militants , including @entity55			0
@entity50 and other senior officials were wounded june 3 in an attack on the mosque at the presidential palace and taken to @entity60 for treatment			0
@entity50 was expected to make a public appearance within the next two days , presidential adviser @entity62 said sunday afternoon			1
he would n't say whether @entity50 would be making that appearance in the @entity3 capital of @entity66 or in @entity60 , where he has been treated for his injuries			2
@entity68 added that @entity50 still has " light burn marks " on his face , but denied some reports claiming the president 's face had been disfigured by the attack			0
in recent days , the @entity3 government 's control has been receding , said @entity77 , an associate in the @entity79 program at the @entity80			2
" there are instances where you can say that the @entity3 government is instigating some of this chaos -- with the goal to demonstrate to the @entity87 , @entity60 and others that this regime -- the government of president @entity50 -- is the best to fight @entity11			1
" @entity77 said the @entity3 government is more concerned with protecting itself from the popular revolt than with going after @entity11			1
as a result , he said , the government has repositioned its counterterrorism forces , retreating from areas such as @entity99 province where it had lost ground , and circling the wagons			0
however , a @entity3 official briefed on security operations rejected @entity77 's conclusion			2
" what about the blood of 66 soldiers ? " he said , citing the number of soldiers who he said have died in @entity99 province alone in recent weeks			0
another 291 soldiers have been wounded in operations there that killed six of the most wanted @entity11 operatives and 40 other militants , he said			2
the @entity87 has been aiding @entity3 's military in its fight against @entity54 militants amid fears that @entity11 is exploiting the political chaos and leadership vacuum engulfing the unstable and impoverished @entity125 country			1
