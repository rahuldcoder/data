@entity0 -- an @entity3 lawyer has been holding secret negotiations with @entity5 for the release of an @entity5 - @entity3 being detained for two years			1
@entity9 , a retired businessman from @entity10 , @entity11 , has been held in @entity5 's notorious @entity12 since his arrest in may 2008 without ever being charged , his lawyer said			1
@entity15 - based attorney @entity14 told @entity1 he has been talking to the @entity5 government since september 2009 and traveled to @entity17 in december to seek the release of @entity9 , a retired businessman accused of supporting an anti-regime group			1
@entity9 , 71 , traveled frequently to @entity5 to visit family and friends without incident , according to @entity14			1
in april 2008 , he went to @entity17 with his wife			0
before he left , he was asked by an acquaintance in @entity15 to take $ 200 for a friend in @entity17 " who was down on his luck			0
" @entity15 has a large @entity29 community			0
@entity9 did not know the individual to whom he was asked to deliver the money , @entity14 said			1
he handed over the money and two weeks later was detained by @entity5 authorities , after the recipient of the money was arrested on charges of association with an anti-regime group called @entity39			2
the group , which seeks to restore the monarchy in @entity5 , claimed responsibility for the april 12 , 2008 , bombing of the @entity43 in the city of @entity45			2
@entity14 declined to name the man , who he said has since been tried and convicted			2
@entity9 has a rag - to - riches story , his 36 - year old daughter , @entity48 , told @entity1			2
he brought his family to the @entity3 in 1979 , before the revolution , and stayed on in @entity11 to keep his family safe			1
@entity48 said her father taught himself @entity53 , started a video game company in his garage and grew it into a successful corporation , which he handed over to his son when he retired 10 years ago			0
" his life was the @entity3 dream , " @entity48 said			2
" he learned everything the hard way , sacrificed for his children and taught us to be grateful for the good things			0
he is wonderful , honest and generous , the kind of father every daughter would want			0
" @entity9 's family was silent for more than a year about his arrest , fearful his arrest would be politicized in @entity17 and @entity0 by getting the @entity3 government involved			1
" it was blind faith , really , " @entity48 said , explaining the silence			0
" not knowing it would take this long , and fear of the system			0
there was never a doubt of his innocence			0
" in september 2009 , with no movement on the case and losing hope he would be released , they hired @entity14 to contact the @entity89 and initiate a dialogue with the @entity5 government			1
@entity14 said he contacted the @entity89 about seeking a consular visit by @entity94 diplomats , which was denied because @entity5 does not recognize the dual citizenship of @entity5 - @entity3			1
the @entity3 and @entity5 do not have formal relations , and @entity94 serves as the " protecting power " for the @entity3 in @entity17			1
a @entity89 spokesman urged @entity5 to allow @entity94 diplomats to be granted consular access to @entity9			1
" we are adamant that we believe he should be released on humanitarian grounds along with all the @entity3 who are unjustly held there , " @entity100 , a @entity89 spokesman , told @entity1 wednesday			2
a senior government official who met with @entity14 said the lack of information makes it difficult to help @entity9			1
" as far as we are concerned , there are no facts in the case , " the official said			0
" our concern is that he should get due process			0
" @entity9 is one of several americans in prison in @entity5			1
@entity3 hikers @entity118 , @entity118 and @entity118 were detained on july 31 , 2009			2
according to their families , they accidentally strayed across an unmarked border into @entity5 while on a hiking trip in @entity123 's @entity122			2
they are being held on espionage charges			0
@entity126 , an @entity5 - @entity3 scholar who spent four months in jail in 2007 , was arrested in july after the disputed presidential election and sentenced to 15 years in jail for spying			1
his sentence was later reduced by an appeals court to five years , and a @entity89 official tells @entity1 he has been released for two weeks from jail to celebrate the @entity135			0
the @entity3 has no information about @entity137 , a former @entity138 agent who disappeared in @entity5 almost three years ago			1
after being hired by @entity139 last september , @entity14 said he contacted the @entity5 permanent mission to the @entity141 and was granted a meeting with the ambassador , who eventually put him in touch with @entity5 's foreign ministry			1
after several months of weekly contact with @entity5 officials in @entity148 and @entity17 , @entity14 was invited to @entity5 in december for talks about @entity9 's case			1
@entity14 said he was briefed on the @entity5 view of the case but was told the authorities were still investigating the matter			1
" it 's still not clear what the accusations actually are , " he said			0
@entity14 left @entity17 without being allowed to see @entity9 , but he was taken to visit victims of the 2008 mosque bombing by @entity39 in an @entity5 effort to show him the threat the regime says it 's facing from " terrorist groups " being financed from sources abroad			1
" i think they had me meet with victims and survivors of the bombing to let it be known that they , too , in their eyes had experienced terrorism , " @entity14 said			2
it is unclear why the @entity5 government invited @entity14 , who served as the ambassador - at - large for war crimes under the @entity178 administration and as a prosecutor for the @entity181 tribunal at the @entity182 , for talks in @entity5			1
beyond talking about the case and attacks at the hand of the @entity187 , @entity14 said his @entity5 hosts made no effort to broaden the discussions to include the nuclear standoff between @entity5 and the @entity192 or the @entity195 administration 's offer of engagement			1
the facts of the case remain a mystery			0
@entity9 's family maintains he is innocent and has never been involved in political activism against the @entity5 regime			1
@entity14 acknowledged the case has been a challenge to investigate because of his inability to question people in @entity5 and the lack of information from the government or @entity9 's @entity5 lawyers in @entity17 , who do n't speak @entity53			1
but based on his discussions with the family and his own " due diligence , " @entity14 said he believes @entity9 is an innocent man , whose only crime is guilt by association			2
as a former prosecutor , @entity14 said he believes if the @entity5 had a case against @entity9 , they would have already tried him			1
he 's seeking a humanitarian release for @entity9 , who suffers from diabetes and whose health is deteriorating in prison , according to his family			2
the political upheaval in @entity5 after the disputed presidential election and subsequent violent crackdown on demonstrators has complicated his efforts , the lawyer said			2
" it casts a shadow over our efforts , " @entity14 acknowledged			0
" what i 've been doing to my best ability is to cut through that , cut through the fog that has been created , focus on mr. @entity9 and work with the @entity5 authorities on the substance of what happened in 2008			1
" @entity48 traveled to @entity5 last year and was allowed a brief visit with her father in prison			0
" i saw him behind a window , " she said , choking back tears			0
" it was painful to see your father , an innocent man , behind a window			0
" " we are chipping away at this , " @entity14 said			0
" i want to give them credit for the dialogue , but the proof will be in the results			0
we are holding out hope because that is the only thing we can do			0
... effectively his life is at stake			0
" @entity48 spoke with her father by phone wednesday morning and said he sounded tired and anxious			0
" my biggest hope is that this message reaches people and somebody can do something , " @entity48 added			0
" not just for my father , but for the many people that are trying to get their loved ones out of @entity5			0
