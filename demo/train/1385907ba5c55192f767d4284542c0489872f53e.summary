-- " there are so many ways of being despicable it quite makes one 's head spin			1
but the way to be really despicable is to be contemptuous of other people 's pain			1
" -- @entity9 no doubt most people who listened to @entity12 's self - serving monologue during his sentencing hearing on " consensual sex , " and " harmony in that house , " wondered at his sanity and his definition of " monster			1
" @entity20 , however , is judged by reality testing and not by caring or compassion			0
human cruelty is not a disease or a mental illness , although it is a plague on humankind			0
as someone who has worked with violent offenders for 35 years , i can tell you unequivocally the number of offenders who deny , minimize or justify their behavior far outweigh the number who take responsibility			1
never mind the tortuous loops the mind has to jump through			0
if the sex was consensual , what exactly were the chains and locks for ? there is no limit to the mind 's ability to rationalize			1
a man who beat a 3 - year - old to death told me that he only committed violence when " the situation called for it			0
i never did anything i did n't have to do			1
" when asked how he feels about the boy 's suffering , he replied , " i guess i do n't feel anything			1
" when asked if he saw himself as a criminal , he said , " i know that 's what i 'm seen as but no , i do n't			1
" a man whose brother took him in when he had no place to go after being released from prison raped his benefactor 's 12 - year - old daughter -- his niece -- and stabbed his brother 12 times when he came to her rescue			1
when asked why he did this , he replied : " i was drinking			0
... you ca n't blame anybody for the rain			2
you ca n't blame anybody for nothing			2
" we are familiar with whole cultures justifying violence as extreme as genocide			0
why are we surprised when individuals do the same ? violence is almost always denied or rationalized -- after the fact , if not before			0
even violence that appears impulsive is usually related to thinking patterns and beliefs that justify it			2
such rationales are important to protect self - image			0
again it was @entity9 who said , " no man is a villain in his own eyes			0
" as to @entity12 's claim that he had an illness , a sexual addiction , there is a difference between urges and behaviors			1
@entity12 could have dealt with his urges by seeking help			1
medication and treatment have been available for sex offenders for well over a decade			2
would they have worked ? who knows ? he did n't try			2
he made a decision to live out his sexual fantasies , not to try to control them			2
in treatment , at the least he would have learned how not to reinforce the fantasies through violent pornography			0
at least by telling someone , he would have had some check on his behavior			2
@entity12 may not have chosen the fantasies that dominated his dreams , but he chose to act on them -- for more than a decade			1
even the most persistent urges are not present 24 hours a day			0
all @entity12 needed was for 51 % of him to have an attack of conscience for a few minutes and want to release those women long enough to open a door			1
in more than a decade he never had it			0
in fact , he tormented his victims not only in sexual ways but in nonsexual ways as well : he showed them tv coverage of their families grieving			2
he told one that her family did n't care about her			2
he fed them once a day			0
he beat a pregnant woman until she miscarried			0
none of these speak to sexual urges ; these acts speaks to psychopathic traits : the lack of a conscience , lack of caring about other human beings , callousness , lack of guilt and lack of remorse -- in short , malevolence , the desire to harm another human being gratuitously while being contemptuous of her pain			1
even now , he has shown no genuine remorse or regret			0
what we saw at the hearing instead was a cocoon of aggressive narcissism wrapped so tightly @entity12 could proclaim with a straight face that chained women were having sex with him consensually			1
yet at the same time he asked for their forgiveness			0
no doubt there are those who will advise the victims they must forgive in order to move on			0
forgiveness is not a gift ; it must be earned			1
atonement and change must precede forgiveness or else it is an empty gesture			0
it is difficult to imagine how much @entity12 would have to change for forgiveness even to be legitimately on the table			1
i 'm not sure his sentence is long enough for that to happen , and to date , he has not taken a single step			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity184 .			1

@entity184 : @entity12 believed he had " consensual sex " with chained women
@entity184 : most *predators* justify their behavior ; it 's not sexual , it 's psychopathic
if @entity12 believed he had an addiction , she says , why did n't he seek help ?
@entity184 : forgiveness must be earned : @entity12 has not taken a step to atone
