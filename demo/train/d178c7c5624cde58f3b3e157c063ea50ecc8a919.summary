@entity0 -- insurers in @entity5 are not obligated to pay for viagra or other sexual performance enhancing drugs , the country 's federal social court has ruled			1
the decision tuesday stemmed from the case of a man with multiple sclerosis who insisted his insurance company reimburse him for the cost of treating his erectile dysfunction , a potential side effect of the neurological disease			1
but the court ruled that insurers have no responsibility to pay for any " quality of life " drugs and that an insurer 's refusal to do so was in no way discriminatory , even if the person in question suffered from an incurable disease			2
during the proceedings , defendants cited reforms to the country 's health care system that were pushed through in 2004 , under which insurance companies were exempt from paying for medication that primarily treated " quality of life " conditions			0
the list included medicines for treating impotence .			0
