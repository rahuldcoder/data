-- three years ago , the film based on @entity3 's novel " the @entity2 " was the focus of protest and controversy , with a @entity8 archbishop calling for a boycott and @entity10 at many levels refuting plot points			1
from left , actors @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 join director @entity18 at the film 's premier			1
but when it comes to the new film based on a @entity3 novel , " @entity27 , " star @entity14 says talk of controversy is much ado about nothing			1
" everybody is looking for some scandal whether a scandal exists or not , " @entity14 said of the film			1
" i think a kind of natural reaction is now that somehow because it 's the second @entity34 mystery that there is some degree of controversy over it			0
and there is really not			0
" the movie ventures into similar waters as its predecessor , " the @entity2 , " with @entity14 reprising the role of @entity34 , a @entity46 symbology expert , and conspiracy theories galore			1
it also reunites the @entity50 - winning actor with director @entity18 , who helmed " @entity51 , " and teams @entity14 with actor @entity16 and @entity53 actress @entity15			1
while " the @entity2 " centered on the complex investigation of a murder in the @entity57 and the theory that a marriage between @entity60 and @entity61 produced descendants , the new film features a murder at the @entity8 and a secret and powerful society known as the " @entity65			1
" @entity16 , known for his role as a young @entity67 in the " @entity68 " films , said that while " the @entity2 " and " @entity71 " are inextricably linked , the latter can stand on its own			1
" if i thought [ @entity27 ] was pinned to ' the @entity2 ' in some way then it would 've been a lesser script to read and it was n't , " @entity16 said			1
" it 's a standalone movie ... it 's not relevant whether you 've seen ' @entity2 ' or not			1
" both films , like the @entity3 novels they 're based on , have been met with criticism for their melding of history and storytelling			0
" i have a strong objection to the genre of mixing fact with fiction , " said @entity84 , president of the @entity85			1
" you 've got [ @entity3 ] @entity3 , [ @entity18 ] @entity18 and [ @entity14 ] @entity14 in the movie all alleging that the @entity65 was this secret society which was brutalized by the @entity10 in the 1600s			2
" " it 's all a lie , " @entity84 said			2
" [ the @entity65 ] never even existed until may 1 , 1776 , but they have to pitch it back into the 1600s so they can trot out their favorite victim , @entity98			0
what happens is you get the audience thinking ' well , maybe it 's not all true , but probably some of it is true			0
' " @entity105 , founder of @entity105 and the @entity106 , first issued an advisory alert about the film in april and reiterated it days before the movie 's may 15 release			2
" now that we 've previewed ' @entity27 , ' @entity105 has decided to keep in effect our caution alert , " @entity105 said			2
" @entity114 is often denied throughout the movie			0
" director @entity18 wrote in the @entity117 that he believes @entity84 is on a mission " to paint me and the movie i directed , ' @entity27 , ' as @entity120 , " a claim @entity18 emphatically denies			2
the director told @entity0 that he attempted to reach out to the @entity10 regarding the film , but had no success			0
he also downplayed reports that @entity125 and the @entity8 tried to hinder filming			0
@entity14 said shooting the movie in the ancient city was complicated given the vibrancy of @entity125			2
at one point , @entity14 said , make - believe collided with one woman 's fairy tale			1
" we had a lady showing up who was getting married at the @entity136 and she had to get married and we had to get our shot , " @entity14 said			2
" she showed up right between shots , when we were moving cameras			0
" fortunately , both the wedding and the day 's filming were able to be completed , @entity14 said			1
@entity16 said @entity18 was to be credited for how well the production came together			0
@entity18 's background as an actor undoubtedly helped enhance the actors ' performances , @entity16 said			1
" a lot of directors are able to tell you what they 're after , but @entity18 's able to tell you what he 's after and help you for how you might play that ... which is kind of total directing , " @entity16 said			2
@entity15 said she had a blast being the only female lead in the film			0
viewers should see the film for what it is , she said , and not focus on the controversy			0
" it 's fun fiction , " she said			0
" it 's a fun movie to watch , it 's thrilling and that 's what i saw in it			0
" @entity0 's @entity167 contributed to this story .			0

@entity14 stars in " @entity27 , " a *sequel* to " the @entity2 "
fellow cast mate @entity16 says latest film is a standalone
like earlier film , " @entity27 " has been attacked for mix of fact and fiction
@entity85 president : " it 's all a lie "
