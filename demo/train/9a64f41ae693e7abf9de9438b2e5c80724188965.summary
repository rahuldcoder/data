@entity1 , @entity2 -- " you discover a lot about yourself when you 're running for president , " @entity0 said on the campaign trail in 2008			1
" it was brought to my attention last year that my great - great - great - grandfather on my mother 's side hailed from a small village in @entity14			1
" two years into his presidency and @entity0 has decided to pay that small village a visit			1
if a village can get emotional , @entity1 -- with its 300 residents -- is in raptures			2
children sporting " @entity23 " t - shirts skip along the high street waving @entity26 flags			1
beaming villagers scramble up ladders to smarten up the fronts of their homes			0
" @entity34 provided all the paint for all the houses in the place , they sent down a lady to coordinate all the colors and she 's done a pretty good job on it you know , " says resident @entity31 , brandishing a paint brush			0
" if it passes the man himself now , that 's the thing			0
" there 's speculation the man himself may swing by the @entity50 for a pint of @entity52			0
@entity50 says he 's had the @entity53 come through some months back but there 's still no certainty that it 'll actually happen			0
if @entity0 does stop by though , he 'll find a large faux - bronze bust of himself gracing the bar and @entity50 says he 'll be ready and waiting with the @entity52			1
" who knows , " says @entity61 who i meet in the pub , " we may all have to join him and raise a glass to his re-election campaign in 2012			0
" @entity61 is a distant relative of president @entity0 and was invited by the @entity66 - @entity26 @entity65 and the @entity26 - @entity67 to go to @entity68 for his inauguration			1
" our relationship goes back to 1761 when there was a marriage between @entity73 and @entity74			0
@entity74 is the great - great - grandfather of @entity75 who emigrated from this village in 1850			1
" relatives though are a dime a dozen in this part of the world			0
@entity61 's aunt , 75 - year - old @entity83 , says she thinks she 's @entity0 's oldest living relative in @entity2			1
" it 's very exciting for us all , " she tells @entity3			0
" we all had great excitement in the beginning when the word came through he was related to us			2
" @entity83 ' grandson goes to school at @entity93 , about an hour from @entity1			0
the college boasts alumni like author @entity96 and philosopher @entity97 , the namesake of what is now the @entity100			0
now it boasts 13 students who all claim some family connection with president @entity0			1
" i was only aware of these two boys being my cousins , " says the oldest of the ' @entity0 cousin ' clan , 17 - year - old @entity105			1
" we did n't realize we were interlinked before			0
" there 's a huge star spangled banner draped across the classroom table and the deputy headmaster has laid out a number of @entity0 biographies			2
but the children admit they have n't read them			0
@entity105 is the only one who 's even visited the @entity26			2
" just @entity118 on a family holiday , but an invitation to the @entity121 would be much appreciated ! " perhaps not at @entity93 , but elsewhere in @entity2 there is a palpable anxiety in the air			2
the dire state of the economy , the burden of day - to - day financial struggle , the uncertainty over whether @entity2 can ever escape its debts -- these are issues which weigh heavy on a people known for their good cheer			1
" we all just want a rest from it , to talk about something else , " one pub - owner tells @entity3			2
as many of his predecessors -- including @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 and the @entity142 -- have done before him , @entity0 is in search of his @entity66 roots , not least because it is sure to go down well with the 40 - million @entity66 emigres with @entity66 roots living in the @entity26 this is after all the start of his 2012 re-election campaign			1
but to the @entity66 on the @entity2 it is a home - coming ; a gesture of solidarity and kinsmanship in troubled times			1
and a chance for the villagers of @entity1 to throw a party that will likely last long after the president 's gone .			0

@entity0 visits village in @entity2 where his great - great - great - grandfather hailed from
the village has *spruced* itself up in *preparation* for the visit
the trip is sure to go down well with 40 - million with @entity66 roots living in the @entity26
