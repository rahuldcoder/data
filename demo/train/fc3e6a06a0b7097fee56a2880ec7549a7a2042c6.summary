the measure would tax individuals on any bonuses received in 2009 from companies getting $ 5 billion or more in money from the @entity24 , or @entity24			1
bonuses for people with incomes over $ 250,000 would be taxed at a 90 percent rate			1
" today 's vote rightly reflects the outrage that so many feel over the lavish bonuses that @entity35 provided its employees at the expense of the taxpayers who have kept this failed company afloat , " president @entity29 said			2
" i look forward to receiving a final product that will serve as a strong signal to the executives who run these firms that such compensation will not be tolerated			2
" the measure now moves to the @entity46 , which is considering a bill to tax retention bonuses paid to executives of companies that received federal bailout money			1
senate majority leader @entity52 on thursday failed to get that bill passed by unanimous consent when @entity15 whip @entity15 objected			0
@entity15 wants " to understand the root and cause of what happened here before we haphazardly rush and approve what we think is the remedy , " his spokesman @entity54 said			0
@entity63 chairman @entity62 , @entity65 - @entity64 , told reporters wednesday , " we ca n't have any concept of we 're getting even , but we must have a concept that we 're trying to show that @entity69 ... can not tolerate that			0

referring to the @entity35 executives who received bonuses , @entity62 said , " i do n't think these are the type of people to [ whom you can ] make an appeal to equity and justice			1
i do n't think they really know the difference			0
i do n't really think they 've had life experience to allow them to believe the pain that they 've caused for millions of @entity107			0
" house speaker @entity9 , @entity108 , said the bill was necessitated by the poor judgment shown by firms receiving bailout money			1
" we must stabilize the financial system in order to strengthen our economy and create jobs , " she said			0
" we must also protect the @entity107 taxpayer from executives who would use their companies ' second chances as opportunities for private gain			0
" because they could not use sound judgment in the use of taxpayer funds , these @entity35 executives will pay the @entity127 in the form of this tax			0
" a similar proposal in the @entity46 would attempt to recoup bonuses by taxing both individuals and companies , but @entity62 said @entity2 leaders decided against penalizing companies because they could simply ask for more taxpayer money			1
earlier wednesday , president @entity29 also lashed out at the bonuses given to @entity35 executives , calling them " outrageous			0
" " people are right to be angry			0
... people are rightly outraged about these particular bonuses , " he said			2
" but just as outrageous is the culture that these bonuses are a symptom of , that [ has ] existed for far too long ; a situation where excess greed , excess compensation , excess risk - taking have all made us vulnerable and left us holding the bag			2
