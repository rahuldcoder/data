-- the box office had to contend with the @entity2 , a very early snowstorm in the @entity4 , and @entity6 festivities across the country this weekend , but audiences still managed to make it to the movies ! that being said , grosses for new releases " @entity12 , " " in @entity15 , " and " @entity16 , " were n't all that strong			1
check out how they performed below : @entity23 's " @entity12 " was the top cat this weekend , clawing its way to a $ 34 million debut , 51 percent of which came from @entity25 screens , and 7 percent of which was from @entity28 theaters			1
on paper , that number sounds good -- and , to be clear , it is by no means a disaster -- but the result comes with a " @entity34 " - ish caveat			2
" @entity12 " cost $ 130 million to produce , and it earned @entity23 ' third - worst debut for a computer animated film , beating only " @entity39 " and " @entity40 , " which started with $ 18.8 million and $ 17.2 million , respectively			1
the 3 - d " shrek " - spinoff , cost as much as @entity23 ' " @entity41 , " which opened in early november 2010 , but that film began with $ 46 million , and it played well through the @entity44 season on its way to a $ 148.4 million total			1
" @entity12 " entered theaters a week earlier , but it will need to endure even better than " @entity41 " to earn back its budget			1
the " a- " @entity58 grade it earned from audiences should at least make that achievement possible , but considering people are already familiar with the " @entity12 " character , it 's doubtful that the film will attract many uninitiated viewers			1
we wo n't officially know where " @entity12 " is headed until next weekend , when we see how much the snowstorm , the @entity2 , and @entity6 really affected the box office this frame			1
( my guess is not much -- and i 'm not just being catty			0
) second place belonged to " @entity71 , " which fell by 65 percent to $ 18.5 million in its second weekend			1
the found footage horror sequel has scared up $ 81.3 million after ten days in theaters , and considering the huge business the film will likely do on @entity6 , " @entity78 " is only a day away from passing @entity76 's $ 84.8 million cume			1
not too shabby for a film that cost @entity80 only $ 5 million to make ! @entity81 : get the latest news , photos , and more @entity87 's $ 40 million @entity86 / @entity85 thriller " in @entity15 " underwhelmed with just $ 12 million in its opening weekend			1
that debut is less than @entity86 's last film , " @entity92 , " which began with $ 18.6 million on its way to $ 55.8 million , as well as @entity85 's recent " @entity94 , " which debuted with $ 14 million on its way to $ 37.6 million			1
ads for " in @entity15 " failed to effectively communicate the convoluted time - shifting story , and negative reviews likely kept older moviegoers away			2
@entity86 's leading man status may not have helped matters too much , either -- audiences seem to find him more appealing as part of an ensemble , like in " @entity105 " and " bad teacher			0
" moviegoers issued " in @entity15 " an unenthusiastic " b - " cinemascore grade , which may prevent the film from finding the same kind of legs that time - jumping thriller " @entity112 " ( $ 14.8 million opening , $ 54.7 million total ) enjoyed earlier this year			1
in its third weekend , dancing remake " footloose " fell to fourth place , dropping 48 percent to $ 5.4 million			1
the $ 24 million production has now earned $ 38.5 million after 17 days in theaters , and it will pass the total of @entity123 's first feature film , " burlesque " ( $ 39.4 million ) , sometime this week			1
@entity126 's latest , " @entity16 , " stumbled out of the gate with just $ 5 million			2
" @entity128 " this was not			0
the disappointing opening fell in line with @entity126 's other substance abuse picture , 1998â € ²s " @entity132 in @entity133 , " which debuted to $ 3.3 million and earned $ 10.7 million total			1
" @entity16 's " edgy story was always going to be a tough sell , and @entity137 's president of theatrical distribution @entity138 admits : " while we all wish the numbers were better , we 're proud of the film and its loving tribute to @entity143			2
" the $ 50 million picture marks the third straight box office disappointment for @entity137 , the young distributor that found success with @entity148 ( $ 54 million ) earlier this year			2
the studio has since struggled with both " @entity150 " ( $ 23.9 million ) and " drive " ( $ 33.7 million so far ) recently			2
unfortunately for @entity137 , audiences , which were 88 percent above the age of 25 , gave " @entity16 " a harsh " c " @entity58 grade , so it 's not likely to hold well in future weeks			2
talk about a bad hangover ... in limited release , @entity160 's @entity159 tale " @entity161 " started with $ 1 million out of 256 theaters			2
that was good enough for a $ 3,774 per theater average , which does not merit huge expansions in the coming weeks			0
young romance " @entity170 " fared better , grossing $ 120,000 out of only 4 theaters , resulting in a $ 30,000 average			0
@entity174 's latest , " @entity173 , " was @entity171 , pulling in only $ 27,545 out of 11 theaters			0
it 's not likely to platform much further			0
zeitgeist - y @entity178 thriller " @entity179 " continued to play fairly well , grossing $ 713,000 out of 140 theaters			2
it has earned $ 1.5 million so far			1
internationally , " @entity183 " got off to an excellent start			0
@entity160 's motion capture animation grossed $ 55.8 million out of 19 territories , including $ 21.5 million in @entity186 and $ 10.7 million in the @entity187 , where its being distributed by @entity80			2
@entity160 is bragging loudly about the film 's performance , perhaps in response to some prognosticators claiming that " @entity193 " is likely to underperform domestically			0
( the picture is based on a series of comic books by @entity197 which were very popular in @entity198 , but only cult hits in the @entity200 ) we 'll find out how excited audiences are about " @entity193 " on december 21			0
