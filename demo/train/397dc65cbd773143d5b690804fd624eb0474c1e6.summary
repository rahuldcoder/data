-- if you 're a big " @entity2 " fan like i am , you were probably crazy excited to watch the movie 's first trailer , which recently debuted			1
for those of you who are n't as familiar with the popular trilogy of books turned major motion pictures , here 's a quick synopsis			2
the story takes place during an unidentified time in the future in a post-apocalyptic nation called @entity18			2
@entity19 consists of a wealthy @entity20 and 12 surrounding districts			2
each year , as punishment for past revolts , the @entity20 hosts a gladiator - like competition called the @entity2 , where one boy and one girl are chosen from each district as tributes and must fight to the death until just one remains			1
protagonist @entity30 lives in @entity20 , and in the first book , @entity30 's younger sister is picked as tribute			0
fearful that her sister would never make it out alive , @entity30 volunteers to take her place			0
as i watched the trailer for the 14th time ( as research for this post ... i swear ) , i started thinking about the work lessons that could be gleaned from the story			1
sure , your workplace may not resemble a @entity49 gladiator arena , but given how competitive it is these days to land and keep a job , it can at times feel like you 're just trying to keep your head above water			1
here , some lessons on surviving a stressful work environment , courtesy of " @entity2 " : know what you 're good at and hone that skill while training for the @entity2 , @entity30 is told to identify and strengthen a special skill			1
@entity30 , who spent many - a - day hunting in the woods , is an ace with the bow and arrow , so she focuses on perfecting her archery prowess			0
this is not unlike the workplace , where having a key skill can set you apart from the competition			1
let 's say you work at an advertising agency but happen to be good at math ; volunteer to help with the numbers side of the business			1
by mastering a job in which others on your team may not be as proficient , you position yourself as an indispensible employee			0
learn to easily adapt to changes in the @entity2 arena , things can change in an instant — one second it 's hot and humid , and the next second the temperature plummets and snowflakes begin to fall			1
these environmental changes are meant to throw off the competitors and make them more vulnerable to attacks			0
given today 's volatile economy , things can change pretty quickly in the workplace			0
if you are willing to adapt — taking on extra projects to overcompensate for a staff shortage , doing work that 's not traditionally part of your job — you 'll show your boss you can handle anything that 's thrown your way			1
seek out an untraditional mentor in preparation for the @entity2 , the tributes are assigned a mentor — someone from their district who fought , and won , a previous competition			1
@entity30 's mentor is an aging , washed out , often - drunk man named @entity115			2
at first @entity30 worries that he 'll do more harm than good , and he does have some untraditional training methods			1
but at the end of the day he turns out to be an intelligent , clever guide and an advocate for @entity30 and her other @entity20 competitor , @entity121			0
apply this knowledge to your own work situation			2
oftentimes it 's hard to talk to your manager , because you do n't want to compromise your working relationship			0
instead , seek out someone in your office whom you admire and can learn from but do n't necessarily work with on a day - to - day basis			1
invite him or her to coffee , and explain that you 're looking to expand your internal network and learn from others who have different roles within the company			1
chances are he or she would be happy to serve as your mentor and would likely find the relationship mutually beneficial			2
having someone outside of your team that 's on your side and willing to advocate for you may prove valuable , should you have issues with your boss — or your job — down the road			0
stand up for what you believe in ( caution : spoiler alert ! ) as mentioned earlier , @entity30 volunteers to take her younger sister 's place as the female @entity20 tribute			2
further along in the trilogy , @entity30 spearheads a rebellion against the @entity20			0
while i 'm not suggesting you stage an uprising against a nasty boss or slimy co-worker , do n't be afraid to blow the whistle if you see something unethical occurring in the workplace			0
speaking up is never easy , but you should feel comfortable confiding in a @entity169 manager who can help develop a course of action			0
if handled the right way , you 'll be helping yourself , your teammates and ultimately the company			0
