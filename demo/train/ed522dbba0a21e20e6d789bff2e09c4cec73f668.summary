@entity0 , @entity1 -- on thursday evening , a boat returned to its dock without its captain -- his vibrant personality and smile gone			1
on the dock was a wreath memorializing the @entity10 fisherman known as " rookie			0
" his family and friends say " rookie , " whose real name was @entity16 , was stressed beyond belief by the effects of the @entity20 oil spill in the @entity10			1
on thursday , a coroner ruled his sudden , tragic death a suicide			2
@entity16 , 55 , a charter boat captain who had been hired by @entity24 to help clean @entity10 waterways and render them safe , died from a self - inflicted gunshot wound wednesday on board one of his own vessels			1
" most definitely a suicide , " said @entity29 , deputy coroner for @entity30 , @entity1			2
" no question about it			0
" @entity16 shot himself with his own gun , kept on board his boat , which was also named " rookie			1
" he sent two of his deckhands on an errand before killing himself			0
he did not leave a note , and none of his friends suspected he would do something so extreme			1
" he must have had his demons , " said captain @entity45			2
for 14 days , @entity16 had been using his boats to haul protective boom off of @entity1 's shores , instead of captaining them on the hunt for snapper and amberjack			1
a charter boat fishing captain for 26 years , he -- like countless other @entity10 fishermen -- found his passion and his career threatened by the undersea oil gusher			1
" the day that oil entered the @entity10 , my phone quit ringing , " he said last month in a television interview			2
@entity16 told his family that he believed the @entity63 had effectively killed his livelihood as well as the ocean			1
" he just thought it was over , " said brother @entity66			0
" he said , ' the @entity10 's dead			0
' ... there was no hope that the fishing was ever going to come back ... not in his lifetime			0
" @entity66 and another brother , @entity73 , told @entity2 they believe @entity16 would still be alive today if he had believed he was making an impact against the oil that was threatening the waters he loved			1
" if he thought they were doing something that was working , that was effective , they were making a difference , yes , but every day there was a different meeting with a different plan , " said @entity73 , referring to @entity24 's program to enlist out - of - work fishermen			1
@entity16 did n't have much choice but to join the program , his brother said -- he used to make between $ 5,000 and $ 6,000 a day chartering his two boats , income that had ceased			1
so , he signed his boats up for the @entity24 program , known as " @entity94			1
" he worked for two weeks straight , his family says , but had n't been paid			2
@entity16 called the program " madness , " they said , and told relatives it was a sham			1
his brothers said he told them that cleanup boats were put in the water close to shore , so people would think they were making a difference			2
" it 's just a dog and pony show , " said @entity66			0
" a @entity24 spokesman did not return @entity2 's calls for comment			1
the company has repeatedly said it 's doing everything it can to fund and facilitate cleanup efforts , and cap the ruptured deepwater well			2
government estimates say up to 60,000 barrels oil could be gushing daily			2
anxieties and frustrations are increasing among @entity10 residents over the ongoing oil disaster , according to the @entity127 @entity126			1
the department says it 's concerned about an increase in depression and the potential for more suicides			0
" we 're all going through a lot of stress , " said @entity133 , president of the @entity134 and a close friend of @entity16			1
" just stress , starting a new job with @entity24			1
it 's something we 've never done before , being in the oil business , so we 've got a lot on our plate			2
we 've all been stressed out , " he said			0
and others might buckle under the strain : " we worry about that every day , " said captain @entity149 , one of @entity16 's friends			1
" there 's a lot of people on the edge			0
we do n't feel like there 's an advocate out there , " said @entity155 , mayor of @entity0 , a close - knit fishing community			2
" we 're bringing in and asking all the preachers and all the churches to step up and help			0
we have a weekly meeting at lunch on wednesdays where we invite the entire community in for support			0
@entity24 is there to ask questions			1
folks vent , " he said			0
" but the big thing is we have to love each other			0
we 've got to be there for each other			0
we ca n't let go			0
we ca n't give up			0
" still , @entity16 's death could be about more than oil			1
@entity149 said the past few years have n't been easy for anyone in @entity0			2
" this has been a long - term situation , " @entity149 said			0
" this started in 2004 , with a direct hit from @entity181 , then the next year was @entity182 , then skyrocketing fuel prices , fishing regulations , then an oil spill			1
this has been six years that this area has really suffered a lot of stress			0
" still , nothing has hit as hard as the oil spill , which has robbed fisherman of their ability to make a living -- and now , of their friend			0
