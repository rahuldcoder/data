-- as coach @entity2 studied the opposing team , he realized his players were at a big disadvantage			1
their future opponents moved quickly around the court , passing the puck with strength and agility			1
his floor hockey team was out of shape			1
while in their hearts they were champions , their bodies were n't quite ready for the challenge ahead			2
if @entity17 was going to win at the @entity18 , @entity2 thought , they had some conditioning to do			1
@entity2 has been a @entity18 coach in @entity20 , @entity21 , for 11 years			2
his oldest son , @entity22 , 29 , has @entity24 's syndrome , a high - functioning form of autism			2
when @entity27 outgrew youth soccer , he joined the @entity18 program			2
since then , he has added basketball , floor hockey and track and field events to his athletic resume			1
i have @entity24 's ; i am just like you @entity2 decided his son would set an example for the floor hockey team			1
father and son gave up soda and switched to water			1
they replaced sugary snacks with fruits and vegetables , focusing on eating an overall healthier diet			1
over the next few months , the younger @entity2 lost 25 pounds			1
@entity2 took his plan to the rest of the team , recruiting his other son , @entity51 , to design a training program			2
" he put the challenge out there and i accepted it , " said @entity53 , captain of @entity17			1
the players began working out five to six days a week			1
they started slow , doing low - impact exercises and lots of stretches to prevent injury			2
since they did n't have a lot of equipment , they used their bodies to strength train ; push - ups , sit - ups and burpees became second nature			2
" it was very hard at first , " goalie @entity71 said			2
" i thought to myself , ' am i going to do this ? ' " with @entity18 , @entity74 leaves legacy of hope the teammates held each other accountable for healthy eating as well			0
if one person was caught drinking soda or chowing down on chocolate , the whole team did extra exercises at the next practice			1
" the whole team suffered because one person stepped out of line , " @entity53 said			2
" it helps you learn			0
... ' i do n't want to do ( any ) more burpees so i 'm going to stop this			0
' " their efforts paid off			0
the team blew by its goal of losing a combined 300 pounds before the @entity94			1
fourteen players dropped a total of 400 pounds in preparation for their trip to @entity99 , @entity100			1
@entity101 , a @entity102 diabetic , got to significantly cut back on his insulin injections			0
@entity104 now shops for dresses that are six sizes smaller			0
@entity53 , one of the team 's biggest losers , dropped more than 50 pounds			1
" i 'm so proud of them , and i 'm proud of myself , " @entity53 said			0
" i feel great now			0
i feel like now everything that i 've been wanting is coming			0
" @entity104 used to have trouble making it through more than three minutes of a floor hockey game			1
" i could n't move as fast ... because i was always getting tired , " she said			0
but working out consistently and eating healthier has upped her game			0
" i 'm able to be on a run all the time , " @entity104 said			0
" i hope i never come back to being the way i used to be			0
" one teen 's journey to @entity18 the weight loss has affected more than his team 's physical abilities , @entity2 said			1
they 've become more confident , working harder on and off the court			0
" we have a saying in our team that we 're champions , but we 're champions in everything we do , " @entity2 said			2
" we 're champions in how we work , how we walk around and how we want to live our lives			0
i think the exercise and nutrition program is just part of that			0
" @entity53 has even learned to control his anger issues , whether that 's an effect of the weight loss or his team 's continuous support is unclear			1
he plans to continue losing weight after the team returns home ; he wants to drop from 350 to 280 pounds			1
" this is forever , " he said			0
" i 'm not going to stop doing it			0
no matter what happens , i 'm not going to quit			0
