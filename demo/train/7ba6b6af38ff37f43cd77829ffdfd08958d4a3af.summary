-- @entity1 was always used to having his little sister trying to copy him -- but not even he saw her latest stunt coming			1
while the 24 - year - old was always destined to be a rugby star for @entity6 , never did he think that he 'd be traveling across the world with his sister , @entity8 , in tow			1
for the first time ever , @entity6 's squad has a brother and sister competing on the international stage -- just a bit different from tackling each other inside the family home			1
" i can show you several scars and bruises from our upbringing , " @entity8 told @entity0 's @entity19 show			2
" i think we are quite a standard competitive brother and sister , so anything he 'd do , i 'd try and do better			2
" we used to play across the landing at home whenever @entity1 wanted to try out his new steps , and yeah , it did n't end well for me			1
" rugby sevens -- the faster and shorter form of union -- is one of the world 's fastest growing sports and will make its @entity38 debut at @entity39 in 2016			1
@entity1 , who signed a two - year deal to play sevens for @entity6 in 2012 , learned his trade in the north of the country under the guidance of his father , @entity46 , in the family 's hometown of @entity49			1
it was here , while watching her older brother impress , that @entity8 dreamed of doing similar			1
" @entity49 is absolutely rugby mad , " she told @entity0			0
" the whole town , the rugby club is just a huge community so we 've been brought up with just a passion for rugby			0
" when i was a lot younger , i used to spend a lot of my upbringing on the sidelines watching him play			0
" i sort of had an interest in rugby since then and played from when i was about 11 to when i was about 13 , then have n't really played it since			0
" but watching him compete in the @entity68 , it 's just such an exciting game			0
i really , really wanted to get involved so went along to the open trial and here i am			0
" @entity8 's presence at november 's @entity72 was a big shock to both siblings -- especially since she had been trying her luck at netball while at university			2
@entity1 thought that his sister would be going away on a gap - year following her graduation -- only for her to ghost in on the blindside and turn up right next to him			1
with just three years between them , the pair remain close even if they do not get to see each other too often , with @entity1 traveling around the world on the men 's circuit			1
" i do n't get to see her much at home as i only go home at @entity91 time maybe , " said @entity1			2
" it 's nice to see her but then i 'm immensely proud of her			0
especially as she only started playing properly about seven or eight months ago			0
" she 's picked it up quite quickly and she 's obviously got quite a lot of natural talent			0
i 'm very proud of her			0
" @entity8 showed off her talent in @entity97 in impressive fashion -- scoring four tries to finish the tournament as @entity6 's highest points scorer			1
for somebody who made the @entity6 squad after playing just a handful of games for her university side and development squad , @entity8 's rise has been remarkable			1
she will now hope to shine once more in @entity109 when the women 's second round gets underway on february 15 , while @entity1 will be with the men in @entity113 for their fourth leg of a nine - country swing in late january			0
but for @entity8 , it is her brother 's achievements which will always inspire her			2
" it 's kind of against my instincts to pay him a compliment , but obviously i have quite a lot of admiration for @entity1 and what he 's achieved in the game			0

@entity1 and @entity128 both play rugby sevens for @entity6
both played in @entity97 -- first time @entity6 teams has featured a brother and sister
@entity1 , 24 , is three years older than @entity8
the pair used to practice tackling each other as *children*
