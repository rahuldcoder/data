-- @entity1 is almost upon us and @entity4 's finest footballers will be marked men -- in more ways than one			1
the tournament will decide which is the continent 's top football team , but it will also showcase a tapestry of tattoos -- the body art that has become the chosen mode of self - expression for any self - respecting footballer			1
@entity1 : by the numbers " i do n't think footballers are too different from other members of their generation -- except , of course , they have a lot more money , " says @entity17 , professor of @entity18 at @entity20 's @entity19			1
" they 're also people who have an awful lot of time on their hands			0
what do they do after training in the morning ? play on their playstations , shop for new cars ? or stop by the tattoo parlor and wile away a few hours ? " he told @entity0			1
footballers are on display to the world , with a global audience of millions expected to tune in for the june 8 - july 1 tournament in @entity43 and @entity44			1
but rather than a desire to distinguish themselves from the crowd , @entity17 believes getting a tattoo is more footballers wanting to fit in with his peers			1
" the majority of tattoo - wearers decorate their bodies because is it voguish , almost a membership to the y - generation , " said the academic , who is conducting research into how people view the future of @entity55			0
" it 's less a desire to stand out , more an eagerness to blend in			1
as i said before , it functions as a permanent bodily membership card			0
" @entity17 says there is no one type of person who is more likely to get a tattoo than another , because different people have varying reasons for deciding to get ink done			0
" there 's no single impulse , " he said			1
" i have a friend who approaches tattoos like a collector : one he had carved in @entity81 , one from @entity82 , @entity83 and other points on the world map			2
" others commemorate the birth of children , weddings or other notable days			0
or their affiliation : my gym is in @entity92 and @entity93 tattoos are abundant			2
" at my gym , there is hardly anyone under the age of 45 -- and a few older -- without some tribal marks on their arms			0
" @entity17 thinks the apparent rise in people getting tattoos is closely linked to the importance that modern society places on the body and personal grooming			2
" we care and tend for our bodies now in a way that would have been regarded as obsessive as recently as 15 years ago , " he said			0
" think about the rising number of cosmetic surgery procedures in the @entity55 , the money we spend on grooming products ( especially male ) , the time we spend in the hairdressers , at the gym , tanning salons			2
" we depilate ( the removal of hair ) , oil , and pierce our bodies -- not for any specific function , but just because we are narcissists			0
