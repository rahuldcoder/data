-- do n't mess with a @entity2			2
@entity3 , who plays @entity2 on @entity5 's hit series " @entity6 , " got into a row on @entity8 with @entity9			1
it seems that the 17 - year - old took offense to the airline 's policy of not allowing those younger than 18 into its airport business lounge			1
and just like her tough - as - nails character , @entity3 refused to back down			2
she tweeted on saturday , " denied from the business lounge once again for being under 18 and without an adult			1
. @ @entity19 sort your s * * t out			0
" the actress went on to tweet , " i 'm not saying i deserve special treatment			0
just saying if 16 - 18 yr olds are grown up enough to travel 5,400 miles around the world			0
. i 'm sure we can handle sitting quietly in the damn lounge			2
" the airline replied to the star , " we 're sorry if you were disappointed , lounge guests must be 18 or older			1
we look forward to welcoming you soon			0
" @entity3 responded with " yes			0
. @ @entity19 fully understand that , my question is why ? why can we travel alone but not use the lounge ? it makes no sense			2
" @entity9 explained that the restriction was " due to the complimentary alcohol available			0
" @entity3 got some support from singer @entity41 , who tweeted " ah @entity43 airways			1
" for now , @entity3 will have to wait until april 15 , when she turns 18			0
might we suggest a party in the @entity9 business lounge ?			1

" @entity6 " star was n't allowed in the business lounge
