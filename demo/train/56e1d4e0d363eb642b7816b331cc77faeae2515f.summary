but it was the club 's failure in @entity7 competition which left a sour taste in @entity9 's mouth with @entity8 failing to in their bid to compete with the continent 's biggest clubs			1
@entity8 has failed to progress from the @entity26 of @entity28 's elite competition in each of the past two seasons and the @entity31 striker says the pressure and expectation on the players proved too great for the team to handle			1
" yes , there was way too much pressure , " @entity9 told @entity0			1

i think that too much pressure just hurts the team			0

everyone who knows @entity58 knows that he 's a winner from birth			0
" @entity9 's new club , @entity10 , last won the @entity52 back in 1996 and reached the quarterfinals last season before losing to eventual champion @entity64			1

while @entity89 's side have won @entity90 for the past two years , it is the @entity7 crown which the club craves			0
but @entity9 is aware of how such pressure can be detrimental to a team 's chances of success with @entity8 just one example of how players can be adversely affected			1

" if we do n't then that pressure will become impossible to escape from			0
" we have to be calm and know that winning the @entity103 again will make us part of @entity60 history and then we can think about everything else			0
" we all dream of winning the @entity52 but our main objective is winning @entity90 " then we can be calm in the @entity52 and everything will become a lot easier			2
