-- the @entity2 invasion continues			1
@entity3 recently announced a new show airing soon -- " @entity5 " -- from the producers of " @entity7 " and " @entity8			1
" the dating reality show premieres in june and marks yet another remake yanked from the tellies of the @entity2			1
although it follows other @entity2 reboots ashore , the journey over can be choppy			1
when @entity18 emerged from his broken ' 76 @entity19 on the first season of " @entity21 , " his co-hosts @entity16 and @entity17 raised their hands ... to bestow upon each other a round of enthusiastic high fives			0
for many fans of the wry attitude of " @entity28 , this show of dude - ly appreciation was a cringe - worthy moment			0
the @entity33 edition of the world 's favorite car show has been gaining in viewership on @entity37 , yet continues to be a point of controversy with hardcore fans of the @entity2 original , which airs here on @entity43			1
as one of the most popular tv shows worldwide ( with men and women alike ) , many questioned the need for a high - fiving @entity33 overhaul			1
it 's part of a bigger debate found everywhere from newspaper columns to online trending topics			0
when rumors flared up of a possible " @entity64 " movie , showrunner @entity55 -- whose other hit " @entity57 " is under threat of a knock - off as @entity61 's " elementary " -- tweeted : " to clarify : any @entity64 movie would be made by the @entity43 team , star the current doctor and certainly not be a @entity69 reboot			0
" not that a @entity2 - to - @entity33 conversion has n't ever worked			1
" @entity71 , " " @entity76 , " and " @entity77 " had great casts and excellent writing , but they also benefited from the originals not being readily available for comparison			0
for a remake to thrive in the internet age -- and in a crowded market where both @entity2 and @entity33 versions air on competing channels -- it has to pave its own road			1
the @entity33 version of " @entity85 " did n't click until it worked through the original scripts and settled into its own routine			2
the characterizations made more sense too : where @entity91 ' @entity90 was belligerent and mean - spirited , @entity93 's @entity92 was merely awkward and sometimes even kind			0
@entity92 was a more relatable boss for the @entity33 workplace ; @entity90 would n't survive one season stateside without being sacked by @entity96 but the recipe is delicate			2
the forced comedy of " coupling " did n't land			0
" @entity101 " was deemed too smutty for @entity33 standards			2
" prime suspect " â € ” which starred @entity113 ( and a fabulous hat ) in place of the legendary @entity116 â € ” turned @entity103 's sleeper procedural into a weekly one - hour version of that scene in " @entity106 " where @entity107 and @entity108 " hang back " to debate foot massages before busting in on the main action			0
@entity117 , keeper of the @entity120 blog @entity121 , as well as vp of programming for @entity125 / @entity124 -- the very @entity126 station that set " @entity128 " loose on the @entity33 public in 1974 -- feels the key to a successful translation lies in subtlety			2
" there seems to be a feeling that with @entity33 audiences you need to lay everything out on a platter so that the audience does n't have to think			2
@entity2 television takes the opposite approach , " which he explained had to do with pacing , meticulous casting , and relatable locations			2
for anyone who grew up quoting @entity145 , watched " @entity64 " when only the math geeks did , or gambled on the color of mrs. @entity149 's hair with their dorm mates ( pink was a safe bet ) , there has never been a more exciting time for a @entity2 tv invasion			1
@entity126 period charmer " @entity158 " is a cult phenomenon , @entity164 's " @entity163 " kicks down doors as a new style of gritty detective , and " @entity64 " is oh - so - very cool now			0
" @entity21 " host @entity165 is even filming a new show -- in @entity33 , for @entity33 -- as part of an original - programming experiment by @entity43			1
it might be time to just let the @entity171 in			0
( preferably with @entity165 's cohort @entity172 manning a beach - bombing @entity174			0
) multiple channels are importing original @entity2 programming			2
online streaming service @entity178 has steadily been adding free programs close to their @entity2 airdates , including the cult action / sci - fi hit " @entity190 " ( currently undergoing a @entity33 pilot treatment by " @entity186 " creator @entity185 ) and the award - winning comedy " @entity189			1
" they 've recently begun streaming the @entity2 version of " @entity101			0
" although as @entity117 pointed out , stateside reality hits " @entity193 , " " @entity7 " and " @entity194 " did all originate as @entity2 creations , which could mean good news for " @entity5			1
" " maybe it 's just comedy and drama that have difficulty traveling across the pond			0
which is odd , because comedy should be comedy no matter where you are , " @entity117 said			0
speaking of translated transatlantic comedy , the industry is in on the joke : @entity208 -- currently the fastest star in a @entity210 on the @entity2 " @entity21 " -- won a @entity211 for @entity213 's " episodes " which is a series about the @entity33 bastardization of a popular @entity2 sitcom .			1

@entity2 tv shows have been rebooted and imported to the @entity33
some have had success while others have not
@entity3 will try this *summer* with a remake of dating show " @entity5 "
