-- in yet another attempt to help stop the relentless bloodshed in @entity6 , a group of @entity3 monitors are on the ground to observe a so - called " cease - fire " that appears to be violated daily			1
while opposition activists have reported some improvements thanks to the monitors ' presence -- including a brief slowdown of shelling and the ability to retrieve bodies from streets without fear of government sniper attacks -- some say the mission will have little net effect , serving merely as proof that the international community is taking some sort of action			1
what exactly are the monitors supposed to do ? the @entity29 has authorized up to 300 unarmed military observers for a 90 - day mission in @entity6			1
the monitors are tasked with observing a cease - fire that was supposed to go into effect april 12 , though both the @entity36 regime and opposition have reported at least hundreds of killings since then			2
the cease - fire is part of a six - point peace plan laid out by @entity3 - @entity41 special envoy @entity40 that was accepted by both the @entity36 government and opposition members			1
in addition , observers are tasked with supporting the implementation of @entity40 's peace plan , which also calls for access for humanitarian groups , the release of arbitrarily arrested detainees and the start of a political dialogue			2
who are these monitors ? the unarmed military monitors are soldiers trained in peacekeeping duties			2
they come from at least 11 different countries , including @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70			2
the observers are selected based on availability from neighboring missions and recommendations by member states , said @entity76 , @entity40 's spokesman			2
what restrictions has the @entity36 government placed on the monitoring mission ? @entity3 officials say president @entity82 's regime has refused at least one @entity3 monitor because of his nationality and said it wo n't accept monitors from " @entity6 " countries -- precluding observers from many @entity89 countries who have been vocal on the @entity36 crisis			1
the @entity6 , which aims to find a solution to the @entity36 crisis , includes more than 60 countries and international bodies , including @entity96 , the @entity41 , the @entity97 , @entity98 and the @entity99			1
in april , the group formally recognized the opposition @entity101 as a legitimate representative of the @entity36 people			0
the regime 's refusal to allow monitors from such countries is n't surprising , said @entity108 , associate professor at the @entity110 's @entity109			1
" i understand their point			0
... @entity82 is concerned with his own survival , " he said			0
@entity115 probably does not want to risk allowing monitors from countries that could be aligned with the opposition			1
he said the monitors could come from " impartial " countries , as " there are enough members states in the @entity3 that are not members of the @entity6 coalition			1
" @entity76 , @entity40 's spokesman , acknowledged @entity6 's demand might be a challenge			1
" that could be a problem , which we will deal with when it becomes one , " he said			0
what other challenges does the mission face ? opposition activists and world leaders have decried reports of retaliation attacks against residents who speak out to the @entity3 monitors			1
" we have credible reports that when ( monitors ) leave , exchanges start again , that these people who approach the observers may be approached by security forces or @entity36 army and harassed or , even worse , killed , " @entity76 told the @entity29			1
in addition to the fear of speaking freely to the monitors , some say the observers are usually flanked by government forces -- preventing a fully objective , comprehensive view of the crisis			2
" if the @entity3 monitor mission is accompanied by military , then they 're not really monitoring the situation , " @entity153 said			1
can the observer mission bring peace to @entity6 ? even the head of the monitoring mission , maj. gen. @entity161 of @entity65 , said no number of monitors can stop the violence without a commitment to peace by all sides of the conflict			1
" ten unarmed observers , 30 unarmed observers , 300 unarmed observers , even 1,000 unarmed observers can not solve all the problems , " @entity161 told reporters after arriving in @entity6 in april			1
" so i call on everyone to help us and cooperate with us in this very challenging task ahead of us			0
" but @entity176 , a @entity36 - born scholar at the @entity177 in @entity178 , said the monitoring mission was " dead on arrival			1
" " no one expects the @entity82 regime to abide by the six - point plan of mr. @entity40 , " said @entity176 , who is also a member of the opposition @entity101			0
" what can i say ? it has failed			0
the @entity82 regime has failed every principle			0
" @entity176 said the international community is clinging onto the peace plan to prove it is taking some sort of action , " to justify the lack of action it should take to save @entity36 lives			2
" since no diplomatic efforts have successfully stopped the violence , is it time for foreign military intervention ? " i think it was necessary some time ago , " @entity176 said			0
" in the absence of a greater force ... @entity82 is going to continue to slaughter his people until he wins			0
he will win when he subdues this uprising , when @entity36 will be too fearful to go out and demonstrate for their freedom and their dignity			0
" but unlike with @entity207 , @entity206 has shown no interest in launching a military mission in @entity6			1
there are several possible reasons why the international community would be more hesitant to get involved militarily in @entity6			1
in @entity207 , rebels had their own capital of sorts -- the opposition stronghold of @entity217 , where they operated out of a large base			0
but @entity36 rebels do n't have such a central operations center			0
in addition , the @entity36 army is much stronger and better equipped than the @entity207 army			0
and @entity6 is considerably more mountainous than @entity207 , which could make military operations more difficult			1
plus there 's worry over possible political fallout , @entity176 said			0
the @entity97 , for example , is in the middle of an election year			0
" all seem to be waiting for a @entity97 lead ... and as long as the @entity97 does not lead , no other countries " will initiate , @entity176 said			2
what other options does the international community have to help end the slaughter in @entity6 ? " if i were a diplomat , i 'd be less focused on sending 300 monitors and more focused on reaching a consensus with @entity66 and @entity68 , " @entity153 , the @entity110 professor , said			1
@entity66 and @entity68 are the only members of of the @entity29 that have repeatedly blocked attempts at formally condemning the @entity36 regime			0
both countries have said they want to focus on a @entity36 resolution based on political dialogue , but many analysts say @entity66 and @entity68 have ulterior motives			2
@entity6 is one of the largest recipients of @entity66 military equipment , @entity176 said , and @entity66 leases a naval facility at the @entity36 port of @entity251 , giving the @entity66 navy its only direct access to the @entity254			2
but the interests are n't just financial or geographical			0
" @entity66 and @entity68 are both very fearful that the @entity29 interferes with internal affairs of states , " @entity176 said			0
" @entity66 has a problem with @entity259 , and @entity68 has a problem with @entity261			0
" but both @entity66 and @entity68 support the @entity3 monitoring mission			1
and @entity6 's failure to maintain a cease - fire could cause enough frustration to shift the political landscape			2
" if any good news came out of this monitoring mission , it further exposed the @entity82 regime , " @entity176 said			1
" this may dilute the @entity66 position			0
... i think @entity66 is beginning to feel the embarrassment that the @entity36 regime is causing			0

the @entity3 monitoring mission was " dead on arrival , " one analyst says
@entity3 officials : @entity6 is refusing monitors from " @entity6 " countries
spokesman : there are reports that those who speak to monitors may face retaliation
the head of the observer mission says all sides in the conflict must commit to peace
