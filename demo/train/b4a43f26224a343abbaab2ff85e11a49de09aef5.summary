curiosity , humanity 's most powerful rover to land on @entity2 , has made a startling discovery : conditions that could have supported life once existed there			1
" we have found a habitable environment that is so benign , and supportive of life , that probably if this water was around and you had been on the planet , you would have been able to drink it , " @entity7 , @entity8 project scientist at the @entity9 in @entity10 , said in a tuesday news conference			1
this discovery is based on the chemical analysis of powder that the rover recovered by drilling a hole in a rock			1
this was the first time a robot sent from @entity27 had drilled on another planet			1
the powder from the drilling turned out to have a wealth of chemicals in it , including sulfur , nitrogen , hydrogen , oxygen , phosphorus and carbon			2
these are ingredients for life , scientists said			0
" what do we mean by habitability ? the key thing here is an environment that a microbe could have lived in and maybe even prospered in , " @entity7 said			2
powder from the drill was a gray - green color , meaning it was not highly oxidized , said @entity52 , principal investigator for @entity8 's @entity54 investigation at @entity56 's @entity55			1
that means if there were organic material present there , it could have been preserved			0
@entity2 rover drills , sees planet 's true colors the sample had between 20 % to 30 % of a type of clay called smectite , which forms in the presence of water , @entity52 said			1
in @entity73 , the area where the rover is located , it appears " slightly salty liquid water " was once there , said @entity76 , lead scientist for the @entity77 at @entity78 in @entity79			1
these observations contrast sharply with the findings of @entity2 rover opportunity , which landed on a different part of @entity2 in 2004 and is still chugging along			1
a rock that @entity82 found called @entity85 appeared to be made of hematite with iron - bearing sulfates , indicative of acidic water			1
that would not have been a habitable environment			1
the rock that @entity8 found , on the other hand , has calcium sulfate and seems to have been in water with a neutral @entity93 " this rock quite frankly looks like a typical thing that we would get on @entity27 , " @entity7 said			1
what we 've done on @entity2 , and what 's next here 's something else exciting : @entity7 also described what he termed " batteries			2
" some of the minerals found have various charges and oxidation states			0
modern microbiology has determined that tiny organisms can derive energy by feeding on rocks			0
life on @entity2 could have taken the form of a microorganism that used the minerals as an energy source			2
he compares this to a battery - powered light , in which you hook up the wires and electrons flow to make a light bulb turn on			2
scientists do n't have any other examples of extraterrestrial environments with this distinction of having been able to support life			0
" this is probably the only definitely habitable environment that we 've described and recorded , " said @entity126 , principal investigator for @entity8 's @entity127 at @entity2 investigation at @entity56 's @entity129			1
with the habitability issue out of the way , @entity8 has yet to explore the question of organic molecules , which could indicate life but could also come from other sources			0
@entity7 identified several challenges with this			0
for example , although the findings concerning water are exciting , the presence of water may mean that organic molecules indicative of life were not well - preserved , @entity7 said			2
a lot of organic compounds also are degraded in the presence of heat , he said			0
@entity2 appears to have cooled with time , so radiation may be the problem instead			1
" our trick is to find a place where all ... of those things went right , and that could take the entire length of this mission , but we 're going to give it our best , " he said			0
but organic molecules could be manufactured on @entity2 from nonlife sources , or they could come from meteorites and comets			2
@entity2 rover spots shiny objects it 's also important to note that @entity8 is not a life - detection mission			1
" if there was microbial metabolism going on , we would n't have the ability to measure that , " @entity7 said			0
and if there were microbial fossils in the rock , the rover would not be able to resolve individual fossil microbes even with the many cameras on board @entity8 , including the high - powered @entity178 , @entity7 said			1
curiosity wo n't make its second drill hole until may			0
scientists are excited about that because the first sample could have been tainted by material analyzed at a different site on @entity2			2
the 2 - ton rover landed on @entity2 on august 6 in a series of acrobatic maneuvers dubbed the " seven minutes of terror			1
" the mission comes with a price tag of $ 2.5 billion			0
scientists have now confirmed that each of the many intricate instruments on board the rover are working			0
" the rover is now fully commissioned for science , " @entity76 said			0
he added , " the keys to rover have been turned over to science team - @entity201 ! " @entity8 landed in @entity203 , which hosts a mound called @entity205			1
the bedrock in the crater where the rover drilled appears to be located in an ancient network of stream channels , which came down from the crater 's rim , @entity56 said			0
curiosity still has plans to travel to @entity205 , where it will slowly climb a mountain analyzing the sedimentary rock to explore its geological history			0
" the question is : how many of these different kinds of ' batteries ' can we find at @entity203 ? i think that really becomes our mission along with the search for organic compounds , " @entity7 said			0

chemical analysis of powder from @entity2 rock suggests area was habitable
this is the first environment apart from @entity27 to be *declared* habitable at some point in time
