-- @entity1 has accepted a committee 's recommendation not to build an indoor sports - training facility in the area known as the stadium woods -- a densely wooded area behind the @entity8 football stadium			1
earlier this year , environmentalists became enraged when they were informed of the university 's plan to build a state - of - the - art practice facility in the old - growth forest , where some of the trees are 150 to more than 300 years old			1
the blueprint had called for at least 60 trees to be cut down for the facility			0
@entity19 professor @entity18 explained the significance of the old - growth trees to @entity0 while tracing a tree sample in his office earlier this summer			1
" that 's the walk on the moon , @entity32 , @entity30 's @entity1 , founded shortly after the @entity33 , " he said , pointing to the rings on a strip of trunk from one of the 11 - acre woods ' elderly residents			2
read more about the tree - boring process @entity18 and others quickly formed the organization , @entity36 , and an online petition was launched to sway the university and athletic department			2
the petition was signed by more than 10,000 people nationwide			0
@entity1 president @entity44 got wind of the controversy and appointed a 15 - person committee in january to make a recommendation on whether the facility should be built at the stadium woods location or somewhere else			1
the committee deliberated for months , surveying students , faculty and staff			0
they received more than 500 e-mails from the public with varying opinions			0
in early june , the committee handed their recommendations to the school 's @entity59			0
committee chair @entity61 said it was " in the university 's best interest " to build the facility at a different location			2
the determining factor ended up being the " social importance " of the stadium woods , @entity61 said			0
in the end , @entity70 , @entity1 's vice president of administrative services , recommended to @entity44 that the university accept the committee 's recommendation			2
@entity70 further directed his staff to " evaluate other potential sites			1
" @entity44 accepted @entity70 's recommendation and , according to university spokesman @entity79 , they are now " going back to the drawing board			1
" friends of @entity83 released a statement saying they were " pleased " the university had accepted the committee 's recommendation			0
however , the statement said , the group had hoped the university would preserve the woods with a conservation easement , which would permanently prevent any development on the land			1
according to a university statement , the school does n't plan to " place the woods in a conservation easement or give a special designation to the property			2
" @entity99 said it would not be in the best interest for the university 's " long - range planning " because it would " tie future generations to something that ( university officials ) really have n't had an opportunity to analyze			0
" the office of university architect will now be tasked with finding another location for the sports - training facility			1
in the meantime , the university will continue to raise money to fund the project .			0
