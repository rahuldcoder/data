police chiefs are asking our help to get weapons of war and massive ammunition magazines off our streets , because these police chiefs , they 're tired of seeing their guys and gals being outgunned			0
each of these proposals deserves a vote in @entity72			1
" " they deserve -- they deserve a simple vote			2
" 5 things we learned from the @entity7 climate change where he stands : @entity5 recognized the extreme shifts in climate over the past 15 years and advocated a transition to more sustainable and environment - friendly sources of energy , such as wind and solar , in order to reduce @entity87 's dependence on oil			1
@entity5 also proposed the creation of an @entity90 dedicated to shifting our cars and trucks off oil			1
what he said : " we can choose to believe that @entity96 , and the most severe drought in decades , and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen were all just a freak coincidence			0
or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science and act before it 's too late			2
" " i urge this @entity72 to pursue a bipartisan , market - based solution to climate change , like the one @entity106 and @entity107 worked on together a few years ago			1
but if @entity72 wo n't act soon to protect future generations , i will			1
" @entity1 @entity26 : wind energy breezes into the record books @entity111 where he stands : what is one thing @entity5 and @entity115 agreed on last year ? minimum wage			1
@entity5 recommended raising the federal wage to $ 9 an hour to help working families			1
what he said : " here 's an idea that gov. @entity115 and i actually agreed on last year			2
let 's tie the minimum wage to the cost of living , so that it finally becomes a wage you can live on			2
" " we know our economy 's stronger when we reward an honest day 's work with honest wages			1
but today , a full - time worker making the minimum wage earns $ 14,500 a year			0
even with the tax relief we 've put in place , a family with two kids that earns the minimum wage still lives below the poverty line			0
" @entity141 : the impact of $ 9 minimum wage troop withdrawal where he stands : @entity5 announced that 34,000 @entity87 troops will be withdrawn from @entity147 by next february and promised the war in @entity147 will be over by the end of 2014			1

we are negotiating an agreement with the @entity147 government that focuses on two missions : training and equipping @entity147 forces so that the country does not again slip into chaos , and counterterrorism efforts that allow us to pursue the remnants of @entity165 and their affiliates			2
" opinion : address gave foreign policy short shrift @entity172 he stands : @entity5 's plan to reduce the national debt focuses on how to avoid the sequester and continue to reduce deficits without cutting education and job training , while asking the wealthiest @entity87 to pay more			1
@entity5 argued that over the last few years , " both parties have worked together to reduce the deficit by more than $ 2.5 trillion -- mostly through spending cuts " and that the government is " halfway towards the goal of $ 4 trillion in deficit reduction			1
" what he said : " to hit the rest of our deficit reduction target , we should do what leaders in both parties have already suggested , and save hundreds of billions of dollars by getting rid of tax loopholes and deductions for the well - off and well - connected			0

what he said : " yes , the biggest driver of our long - term debt is the rising cost of health care for an aging population			0
and those of us who care deeply about programs like @entity202 must embrace the need for modest reforms -- otherwise , our retirement programs will crowd out the investments we need for our children , and jeopardize the promise of a secure retirement for future generations			0
but we ca n't ask senior citizens and working families to shoulder the entire burden of deficit reduction while asking nothing more from the wealthiest and most powerful			0
" " we 'll bring down costs by changing the way our government pays for @entity202 , because our medical bills should n't be based on the number of tests ordered or days spent in the hospital			2
they should be based on the quality of care that our seniors receive			0
" @entity7 , @entity248 - style roads and bridges where he stands : in an effort to create more jobs in the @entity87 and improve the nation 's infrastructure , @entity5 proposed a " @entity256 , to put people to work on nearly 70,000 failing bridges , as well as roads			1

the ceo of @entity271 -- a company that brought hundreds of new jobs to @entity274 -- has said that if we upgrade our infrastructure , they 'll bring even more jobs			0
and i know that you want these job - creating projects in your districts			0
" @entity5 keeps pressure on @entity199 with jobs plan @entity284 he stands : @entity5 advocated for widespread enrollment in preschool , praising states like @entity288 and @entity289 that make it a priority			1

what he said : " i propose working with states to make high - quality preschool available to every child in @entity87			0
every dollar we invest in high - quality early education can save more than $ 7 later on -- by boosting graduation rates , reducing teen pregnancy , even reducing violent crime			0
... so let 's do what works , and make sure none of our children start the race of life already behind			2
let 's give our kids that chance			2

what he said : " in defense of freedom , we 'll remain the anchor of strong alliances , from the @entity354 to @entity355 , from @entity356 to @entity357			0
in the @entity358 , we will stand with citizens as they demand their universal rights , and support stable transitions to democracy			0
" " but as @entity87 , we all share the same proud title : we are citizens			0
it 's a word that does n't just describe our nationality or legal status			0
it describes the way we 're made			0
it describes what we believe			0
it captures the enduring idea that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations ; that our rights are wrapped up in the rights of others ; and that well into our third century as a nation , it remains the task of us all , as citizens of these @entity87 , to be the authors of the next great chapter in our @entity87 story			0
