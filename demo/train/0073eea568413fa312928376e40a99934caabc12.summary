@entity0 , @entity1 -- can we all get a better deal by making purchases together ? that 's the idea behind a new breed of " group buying " web sites -- at least one of which may be valued at more than $ 1 billion			1
it 's hardly a stretch to predict that group buying will become one of the biggest web trends of 2010 , and the market leader will be one of the most closely - watched sites of the year			1
@entity20 , which traces its origins back to 2008 , has a simple premise : if enough people agree to buy something , they all get a big discount			1
today 's deal for those in @entity29 : save 50 percent on a $ 20 purchase of cupcakes from " @entity32			0
" if 450 people agree to the deal , everyone saves money			0
if that critical number is not reached , however , the deal is a dud			0
the site offers one deal per day in the cities it covers , and the number of cities in the network is growing fast			1
it 's a good idea for sure , but it might also be an incredibly valuable one			0
web rumors this week suggest @entity20 may be in the process of raising a new round of venture capital at a $ 1.2 billion valuation			2
the money follows a $ 30 million round that valued @entity20 at $ 250 million			2
in layman 's terms : investors think @entity20 is set to be the @entity60 's next breakout hit			2
@entity20 's competitors are seeing big investment , too			2
rival site @entity63 recently raised $ 25 million			0
@entity65 has raised $ 5.5 million			0
how many group buying sites are there now ? possibly dozens : @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 , to name a few			1
the dynamics of group buying mean that @entity20 has a significant early advantage , however : the more users a site can gain , the more leverage it has to score big discounts from businesses			1
it 's a hot market we should have seen coming			0
the top web trends at the start of the year included the " real - time web " and " location			0
" with almost constant web connectivity provided by smartphones and free @entity88 at coffee shops , airports and bookstores -- not to mention the immediacy of @entity93 and @entity94 -- we 've come to expect instant gratification online			0
group buying meets that need			1
@entity20 is local , too , targeting deals to metropolitan areas			2
there 's a further trend @entity20 capitalizes upon : social networking brings us together to share opinions and experiences ... why not deals too ? is @entity20 worth a billion dollars ? could the group buying market be worth multiple billions ? investors seem prepared to make that bet			1

a new breed of " group buying " web sites offers discounts by gathering mass purchases
the market leader , @entity20 , traces its origins back to 2008
the site offers one deal per day in the cities it covers
the more users a site gains , the more leverage it has to score discounts
