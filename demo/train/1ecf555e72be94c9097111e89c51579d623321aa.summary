-- a mile down in an abandoned gold mine in @entity4 , physicists in a state - of - the - art scientific laboratory are searching for elusive " dark matter " particles , which make up most of the mass in our universe			1
so far , no one has ever seen dark matter directly			1
you ca n't see it , touch it , smell it , throw a net over it , or tag it in the ways particle physicists deal with ordinary particles			2
we only know it by its gravitational effects on galaxies			2
on wednesday , team members from @entity27 -- for @entity29 experiment -- announced the first results from their operation in the @entity32 , deep in the former @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity4 -- where for three months they have been taking an 11 - minute , 4,850 foot elevator ride down a mine shaft to work in their lab. previous dark matter experiments suggested we were very close to the first direct detection			1
they predicted that with just slightly more sensitive detectors , like those in the @entity27 experiment , scientists would have definite evidence			2
now @entity27 has shown those predictions were wrong			0
were they correct , more than 1,600 particles should have been seen in the @entity27 data -- about one particle an hour			2
no such signals were seen			0
what the experiment succeeded in doing was ruling out earlier weak detections , showing they were not the real deal			1
weak detections can be real or just a random fluctuation			1
taking a photograph of something faint and far away might , in the shortest exposure , suggest a hint of something -- maybe the shape of an alien spaceship or the @entity65			0
but in better exposures that collect more light or have sharper resolution , those hints should turn into obvious images -- unless it was just a fluctuation , that is , in which case it would not become clearer no matter how long the exposure			2
if you ca n't see it , how did scientists find evidence of dark matter ? one clear sign appeared in astronomical images taken in the 1980s , with photographic plates and new more sensitive detectors , that showed a really odd phenomenon : strange , long arcs of faint blue light behind groups of redder , rounder galaxies			1
at first , the arcs were dismissed as anomalies			0
they were like the @entity91 of the sky : too odd to explain based on current knowledge , but not clear enough to claim a new species			0
as detectors improved even more and telescopes got bigger , more arcs were seen , typically behind clusters of galaxies			0
that meant an arc had to be the stretched image of a background galaxy -- stretched by the gravity of the foreground cluster			0
@entity106 predicted this phenomenon , called " gravitational lensing			2
" according to his theory , gravity bends light much as the lenses in my glasses bend incoming light rays			0
an image of a very distant galaxy would be undistorted and true if no other galaxies were along the path between it and the @entity121			0
but when light passes near or through a large mass -- like a cluster of galaxies , which can weigh as much as 1,000 times our @entity128 galaxy -- it bends because of the gravitational force of the cluster			2
the more massive the cluster , the more the light path curves			0
the more the light path bends , the more distorted the image of the distant background galaxy			0
so , a distant galaxy that just happens to line up behind a nearby , massive cluster of galaxies looks strangely elongated			0
and most important , the distortion of the image tells astronomers how much the nearby cluster weighs			0
but the arcs implied far too much mass for the number of stars we could see			2
other mass estimates , based on the motions of galaxies in a cluster and of stars in the outskirts of a galaxy , also suggested the presence of a lot of unseen mass. this had to be some kind of matter that , unlike ordinary protons and electrons , did n't emit light			2
in fact , this dark matter , as it was called , did n't appear to follow any of the laws of physics , except gravity			1
by now a mountain of data points to the existence of dark matter			1
we even have data that can not be explained away by alternate theories of gravity			0
so , what is dark matter ? one candidate is a class of particles named @entity182 , an acronym standing for " weakly interacting massive particles			1
" some types of @entity182 have been ruled out by the @entity27 data			0
@entity27 and similar experiments try to detect the recoil of the nucleus of an atom -- for example , the nucleus of the noble gas xenon -- when it is hit spot - on by a dark matter particle			1
the dark matter escapes but the atom emits a flash of light that can be detected			1
the chances of this happening are exceedingly small -- about 1 in 10 trillion			0
it 's like trying to see someone 's nose twitch in a stadium full of crazy football fans			0
putting a dark matter experiment deep underground quiets the noise by screening out lots of particles other than dark matter			1
that 's what brought the @entity213 and the @entity214 to the @entity33 gold mine , more than 130 years after gold - feverish dreamers flooded into @entity4			1
after the @entity33 closed in 2003 , several underground rooms were retrofitted as a dedicated science facility			0
more than 100 hardworking physicists and engineers on the lux team made this new measurement experiment possible , including many students and postdoctoral scholars searching for their version of gold			1
whatever these young scientists end up doing in the future -- and with the skills they learn , they could do just about anything -- they made an important step toward direct detection of dark matter particles			1
imagine having that on your resume : i searched for dark matter in an abandoned gold mine			1
" this is only the beginning for @entity27 , " says one of the experiment leaders , @entity240 , my colleague at @entity242			0
" now that we understand the instrument and its backgrounds , we will continue to take data , testing for more and more elusive candidates for dark matter			1
" as @entity27 and others continue to take data , we wait for a future announcement of , we hope , the first direct detection of dark matter			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity254 .			2

@entity254 : a mile down in an old gold mine , physicists search for " dark matter " particles
@entity254 : putting the experiment deep underground screens out particles other than dark matter
we know dark matter only by gravitational effect , but it is most of the universe 's mass
@entity254 : nobody has seen it , but experiment shows earlier weak detections were not real
