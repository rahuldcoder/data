for most of us , a blood test begins with a needle , a syringe and the promise it will all be over quickly			1
but at the back end , testing blood often requires transporting the vial to a clinic , a range of laboratory equipment and trained clinicians and doctors to get an accurate result			1
the whole process can take days , and in some cases even weeks			0
but imagine if you could put the whole laboratory into a portable unit that delivered a reading immediately ? one @entity22 company says it has developed the solution -- a " clinic - in - a - box " that can test for a range of diseases or medical conditions in minutes , from just a single drop of blood			1
" the physicians were crying out for a simple - to - use device , " @entity30 , a farmer 's son from @entity32 who broke with the family tradition to pursue a career in healthcare , told @entity1			1
" there was a huge unmet clinical need			0
it was very obvious from the start they wanted a simple device that would test for any condition off a finger - prick of blood within a matter of minutes			1
" he said a quick look at the antiquated equipment often still used by laboratories immediately told him that there was a better mousetrap to be built			2
" we looked at the gold standard piece of equipment , we opened the hood on it and inside there were vacuum tubes , technology from the 50s and 60s and that was the spark , " @entity30 said			2
after six years of research and development , @entity30 's @entity32 - based company @entity66 , came up with its @entity70 prototype			1
cartridges packed with tiny beads with a molecular coating specific to the disease that is being investigated are loaded into the machine			0
a drop of blood is spun with the beads and any disease molecules present in the blood sample appear in the form long chains			0
analyzing these samples under a green light immediately shows how much of the disease is present in the sample			0
doctors would be equipped with cartridges specific to the diseases they may be diagnosing ; from heart or liver disease to diabetes			0
the device has multiple applications and can be used in remote locations where access to laboratory facilities is limited or even non-existent			1
one of its major investors has been the @entity99 who are looking to use the device in space			2
" ( it would ) give the @entity99 a device for testing astronauts -- for testing not only there and then but tracking their physiology over their long stays in space in zero gravity , " he said			1
one of the advantages of the system , said @entity30 , is that doctors can reinforce their medical advice with an instant diagnosis			0
" if you can get the diagnostic or monitoring test there and then , the physician can look you in the eye and say ... you 've not been managing your health , when you come back in three months ' time , i want to see better test results			2
" people respond to that			0

testing blood often requires a range of laboratory equipment and trained clinicians and doctors to get an accurate result
getting samples to a laboratory and getting the result is time consuming and labor - *intensive*
an @entity22 company has developed a ' blood test in a box ' solution that allows a doctor to give an immediate reading
the device could be used in remote locations and has even been developed for use by astronauts in space
