that 's what a prosecutor in @entity3 says			1
he has filed a criminal " indictment " against the famed groundhog , who , year for year on february 2 , emerges from his burrow at @entity0 to predict whether spring will come early or winter will linger			1
if he sees his shadow , it means six more weeks of chill			0
if not , short sleeves are days away			0
this year , @entity0 got it wrong , and it 's not the first time			1
on the first day of spring this past wednesday , the @entity16 got pelted with more than a foot of snow			0
it 's still cold two days later , and more chilly weather is in the forecast			1
snow on the first day of spring @entity23 is sick of it , and he wants someone to pay			0
" i woke up this morning and the wind was blowing , the snow was flying , the temperatures were falling , and i said ' @entity0 , you let us down , ' " the prosecutor told @entity28 affiliate @entity27			1
the homepage of the @entity36 , @entity3 , prosecutor 's office , which @entity23 heads , prominently features alerts against scammers			1
shadows are n't just for groundhogs @entity23 is convinced that @entity0 is one and that he intentionally misled the nation			1
now , trouble with the law is a brewing for the famous rodent from @entity46 , @entity47			0
it 's all in good fun , of course , and @entity0 's handlers are getting in on the joke			1
but they are not " ratting " him out			0
" if you remember two weeks ago on a sunday , it was probably 60 , 65 degrees , " handler @entity53 told @entity27 in @entity0 's defense			1
" so , i mean , that basically counts as an early spring			0
" after snow storms and blizzards for weeks from @entity61 to the @entity62 and into the @entity63 and @entity64 , not many @entity58 may buy it			2
but @entity0 may not be at fault			2
some may have thought in the past that his predictions were a vast conspiracy			0
after all , he is sponsored by two clubs , a handful of corporations and two banks			0
on @entity0 's website , @entity75 , his handlers dispute the theory			1
" no , @entity0 's forecasts are not made in advance by the @entity80 , " they write			1
the off prediction could have been a mistranslation			0
@entity0 " speaks to the @entity84 president in @entity85 , " according to the website			2
" his proclamation is then translated for the world			0
" what if the president ca n't hear correctly over the crowd ? is it then still really @entity0 's fault ? @entity23 is sticking by his guns			1
" @entity0 did purposely , and with prior calculation and design , cause people to believe that @entity98 would come early , " the indictment reads			2
he recommends the death penalty			0
" he 's already serving a life sentence behind bars , as you know , " @entity23 told @entity27			0
@entity0 has been making his predictions since 1887 and will probably continue			2
extraditing him from @entity47 to @entity3 to stand trial is unlikely , since transporting wild animals across state lines can be illegal			2
people may be angry with @entity0 about his prediction as winter 's chill dawdles			1
he 's just a groundhog .			0

@entity3 prosecutor @entity112 is going after @entity0 for *deception*
@entity0 predicted a short winter and a quick arrival of spring
many @entity58 will think he was wrong after all the cold they *'ve* seen lately
it 's a joke , of course , and @entity0 's handlers are *playing* along
