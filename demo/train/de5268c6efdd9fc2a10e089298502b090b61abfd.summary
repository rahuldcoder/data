-- on the record , @entity1 has persistently criticized the @entity4 ' use of unmanned drones to attack militant hideouts in its mountainous border region			1
but diplomatic cables obtained by @entity9 reveal that in private the @entity1 government was not unhappy about the strikes and secretly allowed small groups of @entity4 special operations units to operate on its soil			1
in a cable sent in august 2008 , the @entity4 ambassador to @entity1 at the time , @entity16 , recounted a meeting with interior minister @entity19 and prime minister @entity20			1
it coincided with a military operation in one of the restive frontier territories			0
@entity25 wrote , " @entity19 suggested we hold off alleged predator attacks until after the @entity29 operation			0
the @entity20 brushed aside @entity19 's remarks and said , ' i do n't care if they do it as long as they get the right people			1
we 'll protest in the @entity36 and then ignore it			0
' " on wednesday , a governing party representative said there was some public support in @entity1 for @entity4 missile attacks on suspected militants			1
" there is a segment in the country who support the drone attacks , and they feel that drone attacks have been helpful in eliminating many of the militants , " @entity45 spokeswoman @entity44 said			1
" but of course there is another point of view in the country who do not favor the drone attacks , and they think that drone attacks are intervention and violating our sovereignty , " she said			2
she did not directly answer a question about her party 's position on drones			0
she also said there is some " soft " support for militants in " every institution " in the country , including the military , but said the government did not " support those who are close to the militants			0
" asked about @entity83 's comment that there was some public support for drone strikes , @entity1 's ambassador to the @entity81 stuck to the government 's official line			1
" no one supports drone attacks by the @entity4 , " @entity89 said wednesday			1
but other @entity4 records revealed by @entity9 make clear that there were meetings between @entity4 and @entity1 officials about drones			1
a @entity4 diplomat , based in @entity98 near the border territories , mentions in a 2008 cable a meeting he had with a senior official whose name is redacted			2
the official " said he wanted to say in an unofficial capacity that he and many others could accept predator strikes as they were surgical and clearly hitting high value targets			0
he mentioned that fear among the local populace in areas where the strikes have been occurring was lessening because ' everyone knew that they only hit the house or location of very bad people			0
' " the same official painted a gloomy picture of the situation , saying , " our house is on fire and we need to take drastic actions , " according to the cable			0
it seems that @entity1 saw the drone attacks as so effective , it wanted some of its own			1
at a meeting in @entity141 in june 2009 attended by then - @entity4 national security adviser gen. @entity131 , president @entity139 " made repeated pleas for drones to be ' put in @entity1 's hands ' so that @entity1 would own the issue and drone attacks ( including collateral damage ) would not provoke @entity138 , " one cable says			1
@entity139 said the technology behind them was " not cutting - edge " and said he had raised the issue with the chairman of the @entity146			0
similarly , @entity1 has been very sensitive to allegations that @entity4 combat forces are at work inside the country			2
but one cable from @entity25 written in october 2009 noted with satisfaction , " the @entity153 has for just the second time approved deployment of @entity4 special operation elements to support @entity1 military operations			1
the first deployment ... occurred in september			0
" that cable goes on to say that a request had come from the @entity1 military commander in @entity162 , lt. gen. @entity161 , for intelligence and reconnaissance assistance from @entity4 special operations units			1
that support would " include a live downlink of unmanned aerial vehicle ( @entity169 ) full motion video , " it says			0
@entity25 adds that the move " appears to represent a sea change in @entity1 thinking			0
patient relationship - building with the military is the key factor that has brought us to this point			0
" but she cautions : " these deployments are highly politically sensitive because of widely held concerns among the public about @entity1 sovereignty and opposition to allowing foreign military forces to operate in any fashion on @entity1 soil			2
should these developments and / or related matters receive any coverage in the @entity1 or @entity4 media , the @entity1 military will likely stop making requests for such assistance			2
" during discussions on the militant threat , the @entity1 leadership stressed that a short - term victory was unlikely			0
according to one 2009 cable , @entity139 " cautioned that the fight against militant extremism would be a long one , lasting not months but many , many years and that lack of vigilance on the @entity205 's part would be devastating			2
" in this case , @entity205 refers to the government of @entity1			2
@entity139 also did not miss the chance -- in speaking with @entity131 -- to have a poke at @entity1 's nemesis , accusing " @entity212 of providing the precursor chemicals necessary to produce heroin , which he said was funding the @entity216 in @entity217			1
" at the same meeting , according to the cable , @entity139 praised the @entity212 prime minister , @entity220 , but with reservations			2
" @entity220 is an excellent economist , " he said , but he added that he thought @entity220 did not understand the constraints under which @entity139 was operating			0
the cables also reveal great sensitivity on the part of @entity1 to any perceived tilt by @entity227 in favor of @entity212			0
a cable prepared this year for fbi director @entity230 says , " cooperation has frequently been hampered by suspicion in @entity1 's military and intelligence establishment about @entity4 intentions and objectives			1
among other things , the @entity1 believe that we have favored @entity212 over @entity1 -- most notably , by approving civil - nuclear cooperation with @entity212 -- and that we aim to dismantle @entity1 's nuclear weapons program , which , in light of their conventional military disadvantage vis - a - vis @entity212 , they consider critical to their national security			2
" referring to the @entity1 @entity216 , the same cable says gloomily , " in the midst of this difficult security situation , @entity1 's civilian government remains weak , ineffectual , and corrupt			1
" support for strikes there is some public support in @entity1 for @entity4 missile attacks on suspected militants in the country , a governing party representative conceded wednesday , diverging from the country 's official position on drone strikes			1
there is also some " soft " support for militants in " every institution " in the country , including the military , @entity45 spokeswoman @entity44 told @entity0			0
@entity1 's ambassador to the @entity81 , @entity89 , stuck to the government 's official line , that @entity4 drone attacks infringe on @entity1 sovereignty , when asked about @entity83 's remarks			1
@entity0 's @entity275 and @entity276 contributed to this report .			0
