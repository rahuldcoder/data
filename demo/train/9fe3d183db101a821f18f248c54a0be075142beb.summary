-- legend has it that when the surrealist painter @entity3 had to pay for an expensive restaurant meal he would twizzle his famous mustache and arch his eyebrows before beguiling his host into letting him dine for free			0
the crafty @entity9 , it is said , would write out a check for the required amount and sign on the dotted line			0
just before handing the payment over , however , he would pull the piece of paper back and pen an elaborate doodle on the opposite side			1
" an original from the master @entity3			0
i will never cash this check , " would inevitably be the reply from the starstruck restaurant owner thrilled to be gifted an artwork that would doubtless be of greater value than the amount on the check itself			1
by perfecting the magic checkbook technique , @entity3 would rarely , if ever , have to pay for his dining habits			0
people might not hoard the recently revealed 100 @entity31 ( $ 15 ) banknote in the same manner -- but it too is a work of art in its own right			0
on one side , a giant viking boat makes progress upon a tranquil sea , sails blowing in full glory			0
on the other , an abstract interpretation of a pixelated ocean ebbs and flows like a game of watery @entity44			0
@entity45 , the @entity46 central bank , held a competition to design the front and back of the new note , which will come into circulation in 2017			1
the winning designs , announced earlier in october , were submitted by @entity46 graphic designers the @entity53 -- @entity54 and @entity55			1
according to @entity45 , the winning designs display " artistic flair " that emphasize @entity46 's close relationship with the sea , but are also " suited to the incorporation of necessary security elements			1
" these will include machine - readable elements and anti-counterfeiting measures			0
such high - tech accoutrements are now a common feature of the most modern banknotes			1
but art , the aesthetic and items of cultural significance are also a major consideration when designing the latest money			1
according to the curator of the @entity75 's @entity74 , @entity76 , the art by itself is n't a particularly reliable security feature given the " advancement of scanning and printing technology			1
" " those are maintained primarily to preserve public confidence in the note , " @entity76 said			0
but , he added , when combined with complex measures like watermarks , moving color elements and the latest in polymer and paper technology , a detailed image can make forgery more difficult			1
the @entity92 has produced bills in recent years that illustrate this elaborate synergy			2
holographic and transparent features accompany state - of - the - art calligraphy that officials claim is nearly impossible to duplicate			2
instead of using paper , the newest @entity100 notes are made from a polypropylene substrate and feature a large transparent window through which you can see a metallic portrait above a metallic building			2
beneath the portrait the word " @entity100 " is also transparent and is slightly raised			0
other security features include a smaller frosted window with a maple leaf design , which has a transparent outline and contains hidden numbers only visible when lit up with a small light			1
similar plastic and transparent elements can be found on the latest colorful currency from the likes of @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121			2
the @entity122 and @entity123 , meanwhile , are at the forefront of the most complex paper currencies out there , @entity76 said			2
the new @entity123 Â£ 50 note includes raised ink , contains a metallic thread embedded in the paper , and has a number " 50 " that appears in red and green under ultraviolet light			0
among other features , the newest u.s. $ 100 bill has a @entity137 blue ribbon woven into the paper , next to @entity140 's face			2
when the note is tilted , images of bells and the number 100 move from side to side , and up and down			0
the bill also has raised print , a color - changing number 100 in its bottom right corner , and microprinted text on @entity140 's collar -- all carefully incorporated to make forgery more difficult			0
but complex though these designs may be , to our knowledge , a method to counter @entity3 's magic checkbook has yet to be devised			1
look through the gallery at the top of the page to view some of the best examples of banknotes that mix the aesthetic and the latest in anti-counterfeiting measures .			1

latest @entity46 banknotes will incorporate complex artwork and designs
designs *chosen* in part for their *ability* to cater for complex security features
security features built into elaborate designs make notes harder to counterfeit
