-- the @entity1 has declined to reopen an investigation into the 1970 shootings at @entity4 that left four student protesters dead , after the agency found that enhanced audio recordings of the incident were inconclusive as to whether an order to fire was given			1
the students had been protesting the @entity12 and the @entity14 invasion of @entity15 when @entity17 members opened fire			2
nine others were wounded in the incident			2
the digitally enhanced 29 - minute audio clip , originally recorded on a reel - to - reel machine on may 4 , 1970 , from the window of a university dorm , captured the sounds of the shootings , according to the @entity1			1
the agency 's decision came last week in response to a letter from former student @entity31 , 63 , who was shot in the wrist during the incident and submitted the evidence to authorities in 2010			1
he says the digital version was dubbed from the original copy and contained proof of an order to fire , followed by 13 seconds of gunfire			1
@entity0 has listened to the recording and can not confirm that account			2
but @entity31 says an independent analysis by an audio professional on the same recording verifies a clear command to fire before the deadly gunshots			1
eight guardsmen were charged in 1974 for their alleged roles in the shooting but were acquitted because a judge ruled that the government could not prove its case			0
" it 's always been the central mystery , " @entity31 said			0
" was there or was there not an order to fire ? " a federal investigation found the audio quality to be poor and " shouting to be unintelligible , " according to a letter from assistant u.s. attorney general @entity63 of the @entity1 's @entity64			1
the letter says " no military - like voice commands to fire or otherwise were heard , " adding that a statute of limitations bars prosecutors from reopening the case			0
@entity31 argued that he never wanted the case retried but is seeking a " grand pronouncement of truth for the sake of the historical record			0
" " were looking for truth and healing , " he added			0
" when you have a lingering injustice , there 's no real feeling of closure			0
" @entity31 said victims of the shooting plan to announce may 3 , the day before the 42nd anniversary , a plan to move the case to an international court .			0
