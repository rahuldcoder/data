attorney general @entity0 announced monday that members of the @entity3 military have engaged in the hacking of @entity6 businesses and entities , including @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , the @entity12 and @entity13			1
the victims operate in @entity15 , and a grand jury there returned a 31 - count indictment against members of the @entity3 military , accusing them of violating federal law by hacking to spy and steal secrets , @entity0 said			1
the indictment alleges that five @entity28 officers " maintained unauthorized access to victim computers to steal information from these entities that would be useful " to the victims ' competitors in @entity3 , the attorney general said			1
their names are @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 , according to the indictment			0
the @entity3 government did not immediately confirm or deny the veracity of the names			1
in some instances , the hackers stole trade secrets that would have been " particularly beneficial to @entity3 companies at the time that they were stolen , " @entity0 said			1
in other cases , they are accused of swiping sensitive internal communications that could provide a competitor or a litigation adversary with insight into the strategy and the vulnerabilities of the victimized companies and entities , he said			0
the attorney general said that he hopes the @entity3 government will work with @entity6 officials to bring the offenders to justice and that the @entity6 intends to prosecute			2
the @entity3 embassy in @entity59 referred questions to a statement on @entity3 's @entity63 site in which spokesman @entity64 called the charges " extremely absurd			1
" he said that the @entity6 " has fabricated facts " and that @entity3 is a " staunch defender of cyber security			2
" the statement said the @entity3 government , its military and " associated personnel never engage in any theft of trade secrets			2
" the indictment " severely violates basic norms of international relations , and harms cooperation and mutual trust between @entity3 and the @entity6 , " the statement said			1
@entity3 protested the @entity6 action , the @entity63 statement said , and wants it to " correct its mistake " and withdraw the charge			1
@entity3 is a " victim of @entity6 cyber surveillance and theft , " the spokesman asserted , saying that " certain @entity6 agencies have been consistently tapping into @entity3 's government agencies , corporates , universities , and private networks for surveillance purposes			1
" sensitive subject a spokeswoman for the @entity98 told reporters that @entity59 wants to have more dialogue with @entity101 about the issue			1
" we remain deeply concerned about @entity3 government - sponsored , cyber-enabled theft of trade secrets and other sensitive business information for commercial gain , " @entity103 said			2
" and , again , this was specific to the actions of ... of just a few individuals			0
and we hope that the @entity3 government can understand that			2
" this was a law enforcement case , she added , not a diplomatic one			0
" we continue to believe -- and this is relevant to us , our role here at the @entity98 -- that we can have a constructive and productive relationship with @entity3 , " she said			1
" we 're ready to work with @entity3 to prevent these types of activities from continuing			2
" joining @entity0 , @entity124 , @entity6 attorney for the @entity125 , said the alleged hacking has caused the victimized @entity6 companies to lose capital investments in research and technology			0
he added that the " important message " is that cyberespionage " impacts real people in real and painful ways , " he said			0
" the lifeblood of any organization is the people who work , strive and sweat for it			0
when these cyberintrusions occur , production slows , plants close , workers get laid off and lose their homes , " @entity124 said			0
" @entity144 , spying and cybertheft for commercial advantage can and will be prosecuted criminally even when the defendants are state actors , " he said			0
these are the first charges against @entity3 state officials for what the @entity6 says is a widespread problem , @entity6 officials told @entity152 before @entity0 's remarks			1
at a regular news briefing at the @entity156 on monday , press secretary @entity154 was asked about the case			0
" this is an issue that has been brought up by president @entity160 with ( @entity3 ) president @entity161 ( @entity162 ) in their meetings as recently as in march as a general problem that we have seen and reflects the president 's overall concern about cybersecurity , " @entity154 said			1
" we have consistently and candidly raised these concerns with the @entity3 government , and today 's announcement reflects our growing concern that this @entity3 behavior has continued			0
" he was adamant that the @entity6 " intelligence programs serve a specific national security mission , and that does not include providing a competitive advantage to @entity6 companies or @entity6 economic interests , " @entity154 said			0
" in other words , we do not do what those @entity3 nationals were indicted for earlier today			0
" more than 100 people nabbed in global hacker crackdown			0
