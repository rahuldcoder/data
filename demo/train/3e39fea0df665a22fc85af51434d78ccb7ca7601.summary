" this is a very important and positive day in the history of the @entity27 , " said its secretary @entity23			0
" this vote has immediate effect and i can confirm that @entity27 is now a mixed membership club			1
" the membership has also acted to fast - track a significant initial number of women to become members in the coming months , " added @entity23			2
