@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 insists he 's just a football coach and a study hall teacher , not a hero			1
but what else do you call someone who , as students crouched for cover and ran for their lives after bullets rang out in the @entity14 cafeteria , ran at the shooter ? who kept on chasing him , out the door of the @entity0 school , during which witnesses reported another shot being fired ? and who , after all that , headed back into the cafeteria to comfort the victims ? those questions are more easily answered than why the bloodshed occurred in the first place			1
three students died , two others hospitalized and a third got nicked in the ear after being shot by a fellow student , identified by authorities and witnesses as 17 - year - old @entity33			1
@entity33 charged with murder as bad it was , many have been credited for possibly preventing even more carnage			0
a sophomore girl recalled how her math teacher donned a bullet - proof vest , then pulled in a victim accompanied by a pair of other staff members to safety			0
others credited the training conducted at the school , situated in a community of about 5,100 people some 30 miles east of @entity50 , with helping staff and students do the right thing and avert further calamity			2
@entity3 said the hero label best applies to the law enforcement personnel who burst into the school after news got out about the shooting , as well as those first responders who came in after them to treat the victims			1
yet , as much as he deflected the praise , @entity3 has gotten heaps of it this week			1
ninth - grader @entity64 told @entity2 that as he was ducking under a table after the first shots were fired , he saw @entity3 running toward the gunman			1
another witness , fellow freshman @entity68 , said he believed @entity3 probably saved other students ' lives by acting so decisively to go after the gunman			1
" he 's a very brave man , " said @entity68			0
and @entity72 education secretary @entity71 put out a statement hours after the shooting crediting " the extraordinary courage of a teacher " -- later determined to be @entity3 -- " who chased the shooter out of the school			1
" grief counselors : finding a ' new normal ' after a school shooting except for brief earlier statements , @entity3 broke his public silence at length thursday during a news conference in @entity1			1
he did n't mention chasing the alleged gunman , beyond saying that he and others did what they 'd been instructed to do in the case of a mass shooting , " and it worked			2
" but he did talk about being with the three teenage boys who eventually succumbed to their injuries -- @entity95 , 16 , who died monday ; @entity96 , 16 , who died tuesday morning ; and @entity97 , 17 , who was declared brain dead tuesday			1
" i want you to know i was with them , i prayed with them , i wiped their tears , and i know @entity104 was with them , " @entity3 said , addressing the boys ' families			1
he extolled and thanked not only law enforcement , but the teachers and support staff at @entity14 " who went above and beyond , and put the kids before themselves			0
you 're the best @entity72 has to offer			0
" their ranks would include @entity115 , a math teacher at the school			2
@entity117 , a 10th - grader , recalled how @entity115 shut the door to his classroom , told students to crouch down at the front of the room , then went into a locker and pulled out a bullet - proof vest			0
then , she said , @entity115 put on the vest and left the room			0
soon thereafter , he brought one of the shooting victims inside the room , talking to him and trying to reassure him until more help came			0
" teachers say ... their job is , if somebody comes in and shoots , they will put their life on the line , " said @entity117 , describing @entity115 as someone who is " honest , he 's trustworthy ( and ) you can go to him for anything			2
" " you never know it until it actually happens			0
he showed us , instead of told us			0
that really amazes me , how brave he was			0
" @entity150 , another student , offered a similar sentiment when reflecting on what @entity3 had done			1
until monday , @entity3 was probably best known as a coach -- mentoring quarterbacks and defensive backs for the @entity156 , according to a football camp brochure from the program , with board of education notes indicating he has also served as an assistant track coach			1
yet @entity150 said that @entity3 's heart and words resonated with students , making it clear in the past that he 'd do anything for them			1
it just happens that on monday , in the worst possible circumstances , he was able to prove it			0
" coach hall , he always talks about how much he cares about us students , his team and everyone , " said @entity150			2
" and i think today he really went out and he proved how much he cared about us			2
he would take a bullet for us			0
" in his comments thursday , @entity3 again expressed his love for @entity14 's youngsters -- urging them to show that " terror and evil do not win out " as they headed back to class with him the next day			2
" i ca n't tell you how great these children are , " he said			0
@entity2 's @entity187 contributed to this report .			0

@entity3 chased an @entity0 school gunman from the school , witnesses say
but he insists he is not a hero , saying that label applies to first responders
a student says , " he really went out and he proved how much he cared "
