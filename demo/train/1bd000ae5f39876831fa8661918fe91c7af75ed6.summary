@entity0 -- the @entity5 's plans to do away with 1970s - era @entity6 " @entity3 " attack planes will have a ripple effect in places like @entity9 , @entity10 -- a small town in the shadow of @entity12			1
it could mean fewer reservists flocking to places like the @entity16 and the @entity17 after a weekend spent working with planes designed to fight wars against @entity21 tanks			2
in @entity9 , population 2,709 , it makes a big difference when those people spend that cash			0
" there are people who maintain the planes and people who come in and do their @entity33 duty , " said @entity27 , the city administrator			0
" when it comes to these guys being here , all the hotels in the surrounding areas are full			0
from an economic standpoint , there will be some loss			0
" so lawmakers like @entity10 sen. @entity45 and his @entity47 colleague , sen. @entity48 , will do what they often to when faced with steep budgetary cuts that will cause pain back home : fight			1
both senators and 10 other lawmakers wrote defense secretary @entity55 expressing their " deep concern with the @entity58 's proposal to cut @entity60 combat aviation assets and force structure			1
" most of the senators -- many of whom sit on powerful funding or defense - related committees and subcommittees -- represent states with military bases with aviation components			1
in addition to @entity45 and @entity48 , the lawmakers include @entity75 minority whip @entity74 , @entity76 ; sen. @entity77 , @entity78 ; and sen. @entity79 , @entity76 - @entity80 , who all sit on the appropriations committee			2
@entity83 cuts would reshape military after longest war sen. @entity86 , @entity87 , a co-chairman of the @entity88 who sits on the appropriations defense subcommittee , also signed the letter			1
" while we are aware that the @entity58 's budget request for fiscal year 2015 is pre-decisional , every indication including public statements and briefings from @entity58 leadership on @entity96 suggests the decision was made without meaningful consultation with the @entity60 , " the senators wrote			0
" the shortsighted approach creates unnecessary risk to our national security at the expense of incredibly capable attack aviation assets in the @entity60			0
" the @entity5 's leaner budget proposals , unveiled monday , include a scale - back that will whittle the nation 's @entity58 to its lowest level since before @entity110 and do away with the @entity3 as well as @entity112 spy planes , among other cuts			1
fight brewing those kinds of cuts are guaranteed to spark a fight pitting lawmakers against @entity5 officials and state against state in a scramble to keep such things as aircraft carriers and their crews ' economic impact on a community , said @entity128 , national security program director at the @entity129 , a centrist policy organization			1
" what you 'll see is a fight at the lowest levels of public awareness where they 'll try to restore some of those cuts , " @entity128 said , adding that there 's little political incentive for members of @entity133 to offer full - throated support of @entity83 's proposal to trim the @entity58 to a level of 440,000 to 450,000 troops -- the lowest level in more than 70 years			1
last year , when it looked as if the @entity147 were on the chopping block , @entity45 , who sits on the @entity75 appropriations defense subcommittee , offered an amendment to the @entity5 spending measure to save the planes			1
defense policy experts say that these types of military cuts usually affect surrounding communities			1
as troops and the civilian workers who maintain military equipment are either reassigned or move on , the towns that depend on them struggle			2
the @entity5 says the cuts are simply a reflection of the harsh realities of this era of federal budget cutbacks and a shift away from fighting expensive , extended land wars abroad			1
" these recommendations will adapt and reshape our defense enterprise so that we can continue protecting this nation 's security in an era of unprecedented uncertainty and change , " @entity83 said at his briefing			0
many defense policy experts also say the cuts are practical			1
" cutting to 450,000 is significant but within reason			0
it is a cut of less than 10 % from typical 1990s levels , or from what was recently already planned , " said @entity183 , a defense and foreign policy expert at the @entity186			2
" and with @entity192 ( @entity192 ) gone in @entity193 , the portfolio of threats and likely missions has shifted at least modestly away from large - scale ground combat , in my eyes			0
" united against the cuts but if mounting pushback from such lawmakers as @entity79 and sen. @entity199 , @entity200 , among others , and a number of military advocacy groups is any indication , the @entity5 will have a hard time preserving the proposed cuts			1
gov. @entity207 : cuts to @entity60 a ' slap in the face ' @entity80 gov. @entity207 said a @entity213 meeting of a bipartisan group of governors monday largely had a respectful tone until the discussion turned toward military cuts at the end			1
" it automatically went into an aggressive nature by ( president @entity224 ) , implying that ' many of you have asked for cuts , this is what you said you wanted ... now you 're going to get it , you 're going to have to live with it			0
' completely different change in tone , " said @entity207 , who 's up for re-election this year and who made her remarks at a news conference by the @entity234 after the gathering at the @entity213			0
" it chilled the room quite a bit , " she added			0
groups like the @entity242 , an advocacy group , are also urging their members to pressure their congressional lawmakers to reject many proposed cuts , such as trimming @entity60 numbers and shifting @entity248 helicopters from the guard to the active - duty @entity58			1
" the @entity60 is a commonsense solution to the challenges facing the @entity254 military , " said @entity250 , director of communications for the @entity242			0
" @entity133 and the nation 's governors see it			2
unfortunately , the @entity5 does not or will not			2
we are disappointed , but we are hardly defeated			0
" chairman of the @entity261 rep. @entity260 , whose @entity263 district neighbors the congressional district housing @entity265 , says he too is deeply concerned about the impact of the proposed cuts			1
" this president is sacrificing our most important responsibility , our national defense , on the altar of entitlements , " he told @entity1 in a prepared statement			0
" instead of taking on mandatory spending and reforming our entitlement programs , he 's proposing dangerous cuts that could greatly affect our military readiness and national security			1
the proposed troop levels and cuts are yet another retreat by this president when it comes to the ability of our armed forces to effectively do their jobs and to the safety and security of our borders			2
" @entity27 , the @entity9 city administrator , said he 'll leave the debates about what members of @entity133 should cut regarding the @entity147 to those elected officials			2
but he knows one thing for sure : when it comes to getting rid of the @entity147 , he says , " i do n't think it 's a good idea , personally			0
but that 's just my opinion			0
" food stamp use among military rises again @entity1 's @entity302 and @entity303 contributed to this report .			0

military communities , defense businesses will feel impact of proposed @entity5 cuts
lawmakers will fight to keep cuts from hitting their home states and districts
defense policy experts say the cuts , while practical , face an *uphill* battle in @entity133
the fight to preserve certain programs and weapons will get personal
