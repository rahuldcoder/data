@entity0 -- @entity3 billionaire businessman and outspoken @entity5 critic @entity4 has dismissed a charge of hooliganism and assault filed against him after he punched a fellow guest on a television show last year as unsubstantiated and " clearly a political act			1
" the part - owner of @entity3 opposition newspaper @entity14 , whose son @entity15 owns @entity17 's @entity16 , faces five years in prison for attacking businessman @entity19 on the " @entity21 " show , which aired on september 16 , 2011			1
in an exclusive interview with @entity1 , @entity4 conceded he may have gone too far but insisted he was acting in self - defense when he launched his extraordinary assault on @entity19			1
" i felt threatened , " he said			2
" my point was i need to stop it otherwise it 's going to go into not only an insult and intimidation but a hit in the face			2
" i might have over-reacted : normally i 'm a very quiet person ... i was not looking for any violation of public order			0
" @entity4 , who was described by the @entity33 as a lawmaker in the @entity35 , has been charged with hooliganism and assault motivated by political hatred , the same offense for which members of punk band @entity41 were jailed this year			1
on monday the band members launched an appeal against their sentence , which followed their performance of a song critical of president @entity47 in one of @entity0 's grandest cathedrals			2
the @entity41 charges sparked international concern about freedom of speech in @entity3 , and @entity4 said his case is similar			1
" how could political hatred emerge from a completely cut - out and edited discussion about some murky subject of the world economic crisis ? why should it be considered hooliganism ? it 's the same as the @entity41 case			1
it 's clearly a political case			0
all motivation is political ; everything else is fabrication			0

it clearly exists , " he said			0
" i thought i 'm not a politician , just a publisher of a paper and i 'm also a citizen who might , from time to time , voice concerns about things			0
" i 'm still defending the position that it would be much wiser for @entity47 to install real @entity91 quality , adapted to @entity3 realities and institutions with competition between political forces			0
" he said he is prepared to pay a heavy price for his principles , but hopes he wo n't go to prison			2
in the meantime , " i 'll stay and face the charges and go for a trial			0
