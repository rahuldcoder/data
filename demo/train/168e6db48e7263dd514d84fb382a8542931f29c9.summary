@entity0 , @entity1 of surface timber from sustainably - sourced @entity8 pine for its construction , the velodrome for the @entity11 has been unveiled as the pride of local organizers			1
pressure to deliver is always a concern for the host city of the quadrennial @entity18 -- with @entity21 and @entity22 being notable illustrators of the struggle endured in 2004 and 1996 respectively -- and it is a demand keenly felt in the capital of @entity25 , 18 months before the start of the latest edition of the iconic games			2
@entity30 chairman @entity29 said the completion of the venue marked the site 's " biggest milestone to - date , " emphasizing the ambition of all associated with event to maintain the " on - budget , on - time theme " set by the velodrome			1
whether this goal can be achieved has yet to be seen but lead architect for the cycle - center project , @entity43 , told @entity2 he felt the aesthetic challenge set for his team had been met			1
" [ the aesthetic ] was fundamental , because most velodromes end up being on a piece of government land somewhere			0
this site was always going to be in the @entity51 , so ... we designed it [ instead ] for legacy			0
" we put a ring of glass all the way around the venue because we thought we could landscape the park up to the glass , allowing anybody to walk up and look in to see the cyclists , " @entity43 , of @entity55 , said			1
creatively , the team tried to use the vehicle at the center of the building 's function as inspiration ; namely the bicycle			2
" we had n't designed a velodrome before , so at the beginning we sat down with the engineers and looked at it with a clean sheet of paper , and i think that was a big advantage , " @entity43 said			1
" we decided to base everything on the bicycle -- so the engineering would be infused with that sense of efficiency and lightness			2
the roof , for instance , is held up with cables that are only 36 millimeters in diameter , [ but ] there 's 100 tonnes of steel in the whole roof , so it 's incredibly efficient			0
" on top of that , we have daylight streaming in , very sustainable [ lightning ] ; the model of the bike has been reapplied to the architecture and engineering of the building in this way			0
" the echoes of strength provided to the wheels of a bike via the tension of its spokes with the construction of the sweeping roof is obvious , but it proved to be only the first of many hurdles to be crossed in the design and construction process			0
" the track is a real piece of difficult furnishing to build			2
it 's 250 meters long , it 's made up of 40 by 40 - millimeter sections , five or six meters in length , of @entity8 pine which was specifically selected because the trees grow very straight , " @entity43 said			1
" it 's got no expansion joints in it , so when it 's hot and dries out it tends to move up and down , so it sits in a concrete bowl , almost like a piece of furniture			0
" the smooth curves of the new oval track , with its vertiginous banks at either end , was designed by specialist @entity138			0
and though the @entity25 cyclists -- four - time olympic gold medallist @entity140 among them -- who tested out the decking for the first time seemed happy with the results , @entity43 could only look on with envy			1
" i 'm a cyclist myself , we 're all dying to have a go , but today it 's their turn			0
" the plan is for the $ 150 million stadium to remain at the center of @entity25 cycling once the @entity18 have finished			0
@entity11 will also have a road - cycle circuit , mountain - bike track and @entity156 layout to create what is hoped will be an " all - in - one " cycling hub for all disciplines .			1

the velodrome for the @entity11 is the first venue to open in @entity0 ahead of games
cycle track requires 56km of surface timber from sustainably - sourced @entity8 pine
lead architect @entity43 says the inspiration for the arena came from the bicycle
