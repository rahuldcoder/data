-- there was no @entity3 , there was no @entity4 and for a while , it appeared that there might not have been any more @entity9 football in the @entity11 capital			1
but @entity12 , without the suspended @entity3 and benched @entity4 , booked its place in the quarterfinals for the first time since 1995 following a 1 - 1 draw with @entity17			1
the result , which sends @entity12 through to the last eight 3 - 2 on aggregate courtesy of its win in @entity22 three weeks ago , had been in some doubt following @entity25 ' fine strike			1
@entity4 shows he can still cut it @entity17 had looked finished in the first leg , trailing 2 - 0 before a last minute effort enabled it to cling on to the possibility of producing an unlikely comeback			1
that outcome appeared possible soon after the interval when @entity25 lashed home a powerful effort to stun the home crowd			2
with @entity17 needing just one more goal to progress , @entity12 began to awake from its slumber with the introduction of striker @entity40			1
and it was the substitute who made the difference , running through the @entity17 defense before the ball found its way into the path of @entity47 , who slotted home his fifth goal of this year 's competition			1
@entity12 has invested heavily in the transfer market in recent seasons , spending a reported $ 260 million bringing in the likes of @entity54 , defender @entity55 , striker @entity3 and @entity56 along with several others			1
the arrivals of @entity47 , @entity59 and the highly publicized acquisition of @entity4 has bolstered the @entity12 brand , which is heavily backed by a subsidiary of the government of @entity64			1
and with his team top of @entity68 by two points and through to the next stage of @entity72 's elite competition , it looks like money well spent by manager @entity74			2
@entity4 to donate @entity12 wages to children 's charity " we deserved our qualification over the two legs , " he told reporters			1
" we did n't play in a relaxed manner in the first half , but paradoxically it was after @entity17 scored that we started to play and cause them problems			1
" @entity17 coach @entity86 was left disappointed with the result but admitted that he could not criticize his players for their performance			1
" it was a hard - fought game , " he said			2
" we wanted to score the first goal and make them nervous , but in the end it was n't to be			2
" i am satisfied with the way the team played , even if i 'm not happy to be out			0
" @entity97 leaves @entity99 's @entity9 dream in tatters in the night 's other game , @entity97 cruised past @entity99 2 - 0 to complete a comfortable 5 - 0 aggregate win			1
@entity103 and @entity104 were both on target as @entity97 secured its place in the last eight for the first time since 2006			2
@entity110 's left foot -- yours for $ 5.25 million @entity99 , which had beaten @entity112 in the @entity113 of the competition , rarely threatened and was comprehensively outplayed over the two legs			2
but manager @entity116 refused to be downcast , instead preferring to concentrate on his side 's run to the last - 16			2
" the support of the club is amazing and it is a privilege to manage them			0
it has been a fantastic experience , " @entity116 told @entity122			0
" we have been brilliant in the league			0
i do not like losing			0
as you get older , you learn from other managers			0
" even the greatest managers lose their temper from time to team			0
we want to see our team perform all the time and we are under scrutiny all the time			0
i would rather be managing here than at other clubs			0
" you do not know the circumstances of next season , i may never get to do this again			0
the two games against @entity112 were titanic and i will take them in the memory bank			0
i hope we have plenty more of those to come			0
" @entity145 sinks @entity146 meanwhile , @entity146 manager @entity147 and his players are facing disciplinary action from @entity72 after refusing to speak to the media following the team 's controversial defeat tuesday			0
@entity146 , which was beaten 2 - 1 by @entity145 at @entity153 , was angered by the sending off of @entity154 by @entity156 referee @entity155			1
@entity147 did not attend the mandatory press conference following the contest , while players did not talk to media in the mixed zone .			0

@entity12 through to quarterfinals of @entity9
@entity12 holds @entity17 1 - 1 to progress 3 - 2 on aggregate
