editor 's note : @entity2 , a @entity3 strategist and @entity5 political contributor , was a political consultant for @entity7 's presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to @entity7 in the @entity9			1
he is an affiliated professor at @entity11 's @entity10 and an adviser to the @entity13 , which supports president @entity15 's health care plan			1
@entity2 says health care is n't getting attention it deserves -- and @entity15 administration is partly to blame			1
( @entity5 ) -- you probably have never heard of @entity20 , and that 's what 's wrong with the debate over health care reform			1
@entity20 , a retired nurse from @entity25 , @entity26 , had health insurance -- or so she thought			2
she paid her premiums faithfully every month , but when she was diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer , her health insurance company , @entity30 , dumped her			2
the insurance company said the fact that she had seen a dermatologist for acne , who mistakenly entered a notation on her chart that suggested her simple acne was a precancerous condition , allowed @entity30 to leave her in the lurch			0
@entity20 testified before a @entity9 subcommittee this week			0
so did other @entity42 who thought they had insurance but got the shaft			0
as @entity46 of @entity47 ( who has been the journalistic conscience of health care coverage ) wrote , other witnesses included : " @entity50 , whose brother @entity51 lost his insurance coverage right before he was scheduled to receive an expensive stem - cell transplant to treat his lymphoma			1
why ? because @entity55 discovered his doctor had found gall stones and an aneurysm on a ct scan -- conditions that had nothing to do with his cancer , that never bothered him and that he was n't even aware of			0
and @entity66 of @entity67 , @entity68 , whose coverage was canceled because she had been taking a drug for irregular menstruation			2
now , she ca n't get coverage anywhere else			2
' since my rescission , i have had to take jobs that i do not want , and put my career goals on hold to ensure that i can find health insurance , ' she told the subcommittee			1
" the subcommittee 's chairman , democrat @entity80 of @entity82 , called the hearing to highlight the obnoxious and unethical practice called rescission			1
his researchers produced performance reviews of insurance company bureaucrats who were praised and rewarded for kicking people off their coverage			1
then @entity80 asked three health insurance executives the big question : will your company pledge to end the practice of rescission except in cases of intentional fraud ? all three health insurance executives said no. it was as dramatic as congressional testimony gets			1
yet it got no airtime on the networks , nor , as far as i can tell , on cable news , although @entity5 did run a story			0
@entity47 's @entity46 was all over it , as was @entity109 of @entity110			0
but the story did not make the @entity112			0
nor the @entity113 , which found space on the front page the morning after the hearing for a story on the cancellation of @entity120 fireworks in @entity121 , @entity122 , but not a story on the cancellation of health insurance for deathly ill @entity42 who 've paid their premiums			1
@entity80 , and the @entity128 chairman , @entity127 , @entity68 , did their job			0
why did n't the media do its ? why were the outrages uncovered by @entity80 and @entity127 un-covered by most of the media ? maybe because the @entity15 @entity9 drew the spotlight away from health care			1
they 'd diverted the media to cover @entity15 's proposed reforms of the financial regulatory system			1
on the last day of the 1992 @entity141 campaign , we had the media a-team traveling with us			2
so i made it my business to sit next to @entity146 , then with @entity147 but a former top aide to presidents @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 ( at that point -- little did i know he would soon be working for president @entity7 )			0
i had never seen a communications shop as effective as @entity151 's , and i was n't going to miss an opportunity to learn from a master			0
@entity146 told me an anecdote i still remember vividly			0
in the opening months of the @entity151 presidency , it was the economy , stupid			0
@entity42 was mired in a recession , and president @entity151 wanted to focus the nation 's attention on his economic plan			2
but secretary of state @entity163 had other ideas			0
the @entity165 had nothing to do with the economy , and @entity163 had ambitious plans			0
so , @entity146 told me , @entity163 got a bunch of good press , advocating for intercepting @entity172 gun runners ( if memory serves )			0
you would think a staunch anti-communist such as @entity151 would have been happy			0
but , no. @entity151 's chief of staff , @entity176 , upbraided @entity163 for diverting media attention away from the primary goal : passing the president 's economic plan			1
i never forgot @entity146 's story -- especially when the @entity182 wandered off message as it tried to pursue fundamental reform of the health care system			1
the economic plan eclipsed health care for much of @entity7 's first year			1
and the crime bill , which included the @entity191 and other gun control measures			0
and do n't forget gays in the military			0
and a foreign policy crisis in @entity196 -- and another in @entity197			0
@entity7 gave his health care address to the @entity200 on september 23 , 1993			1
october was supposed to be " @entity201 " in the @entity9 , but so many other issues got in the way that he had just one public event focused on health care in the entire month -- just one			1
i understand that @entity15 's @entity9 team has to juggle a lot of issues ; i 've been there			2
and i 'm sure the @entity15 financial reforms have merit			2
but if the president wants to pass his ambitious health care reform , he 's going to have to put other , worthy , ideas on the back burner and shine the media spotlight on the plight of people like @entity20			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : health insurers are *depriving* some ill people of coverage
he says practice called " rescission " is used to deny people *benefits*
@entity2 says hearing on rescission got little media attention
he says @entity15 administration must put health care on front burner
