-- democrats will soon return to the airwaves in @entity3 to back @entity4 , according to a source at the @entity6			1
the decision comes as @entity1 insist polls show their candidate , @entity4 , can still win in her race against @entity12 @entity11			1
as of last week , the @entity6 had not purchased airtime for @entity4 at all through the end of the campaign			1
that news got out the morning after she was roundly criticized for awkwardly refusing to answer questions about whether she voted for president @entity20			0
but polling suggests @entity4 is still competitive			0
a @entity24 / @entity23 poll of voters from oct. 15 - 19 found @entity26 up by just one point			0
the @entity6 source said their polling suggests undecided voters are moving toward @entity4 , though there 's little public data to back that up			2
even last week when they conceded they had no plans to air tv ads for @entity4 , national @entity1 still promised to spend money on the ground to get out the vote			0
the reality is that the back and forth about money for tv ads is more symbolic of how national @entity1 view @entity4 ' chances -- and perhaps differences with locals over how to run the campaign -- than it is practical @entity3 is flush with cash from both the campaigns and outside groups and sources in both parties concede at this point neither candidate will win or lose for lack of money			2
@entity57 first reported the @entity6 's decision to return to @entity3 .			1

the @entity6 will return to the airwaves to support @entity4
the @entity6 went dark in @entity3 last week
polls show @entity4 can still beat @entity64 sen. @entity11
