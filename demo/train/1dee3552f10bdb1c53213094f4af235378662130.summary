-- of all the scenarios firefighters train for , confronting a hostage - taker might not seem to be high on the list			1
or suddenly dodging a sniper 's deadly aim			0
but training and keeping calm apparently did come into play wednesday when four @entity10 , @entity11 , firefighters became hostages while a gunman held off authorities			1
the situation ended with the firefighters free and the gunman dead at the hands of police			1
that incident highlighted a fact of life for firefighters -- their life - saving work can sometimes put them in the middle of criminal situations			1
the @entity11 event is akin to last year 's @entity30 state incident in which a sniper ambushed and killed two firefighters responding to his burning home , one expert said thursday			1
firefighters are trained to call police if they sense a potentially violent situation , but the @entity11 and @entity30 episodes involved surprise attacks			1
police : hostage taker gave us no choice " it 's almost impossible to prepare for that situation if there 's no indication of any potential threat , " said @entity42 , chairman of the @entity43 and the @entity44			1
" tragic as these situations are , they are relatively rare , " @entity42 added			1
for sure , local firefighters will now be working with extra vigilance , said capt. @entity54 of @entity55 and @entity56			1
the hostage - taking incident occurred after firefighters entered the home of a man in response to a medical call			1
all 850 of the county 's firefighters are already cross-trained as emergency medical technicians , and many are also paramedics , @entity54 said			2
" yesterday was an element of surprise to that crew , " @entity54 said thursday			2
" how do you train for that ? it heightens our awareness and it shows that things like that can occur			2
" will they look for triggers that something might be wrong as they approach ? yes , " he said			0
while held hostage , the @entity10 firefighters kept calm and , as importantly , worked to keep the gunman calm , @entity54 said			1
" luckily our personnel are trained on how to not only keep themselves calm but keep the individual calm , " @entity54 said			0
" no doubt their calm composure brought about a successful closure for the fire department personally			0
" it 's unfortunate that the individual lost his life but as the police said , he was in control and he could have let those firefighters go and he 's responsible for his action and the ultimate ending , " @entity54 added			1
@entity98 , chairman of the terrorism and homeland security committee of the @entity101 , said fire departments must communicate more with their police partners on how to handle scenarios such as the ones in @entity11 and @entity30			1
@entity98 described firefighters ' current training on operational security -- measures to protect themselves -- as " less than adequate			1
" " it really does need to go to a new level -- these conversations where i 'm asking my police chief ( to ) help me with what we need to understand going into a situation that could turn as bad as @entity10 and @entity30 , " said @entity98 , who 's also chief of the @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112			1
some fire and police agencies around the country are already sharing such information , @entity98 said			2
for the past four years , his fire department has been " tightly integrated with police , " @entity98 said			2
" there is n't a law enforcement officer who does n't go into every situation without suspicions on how that situation could turn on them and pose a threat to them , " @entity98 said			0
" for the average firefighter and @entity137 , that is n't foremost on their minds			0
" what we 're seeing , certainly out of these two incidents , more and more of what we would consider a standard response to @entity143 and fire emergencies can go horribly wrong			0
we need to think about what are the other dimensions to this crisis that the routines do not suggest , " he said			0
firefighters around the country are instructed on how to respond to violent scenarios -- wait for police to secure the scene so that the firefighters can do their jobs saving lives and property -- but that instruction presumes the firefighter has already noticed something amiss , @entity42 said			2
if that 's noticed inside a home , a firefighter keeps a close eye on the suspicious person -- and especially where that person is , he said			0
" the kitchen is the most dangerous place for them to be if they are acting abnormally because that 's where they keep the knives and the pan of hot grease on the stove , " @entity42 said			0
" there 's lot of things that people can hurt you with in the kitchen			0
" but instruction is more difficult in those fire calls where " you step off a truck and someone shoots when there is no likelihood of violence , " he said			0
" i do n't know how you deal with that one , " added @entity42 , who 's also chief of the @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity112 , an all - volunteer agency			0
in the last 10 years or so , however , firefighters are increasingly being cross-training to become certified police officers assigned to @entity203 teams , @entity42 said			2
in an era of high body - count mass shootings since @entity209 's @entity208 in 1999 , police departments are demanding their @entity203 teams include a firefighter with emergency medical service skills , @entity42 said			2
" @entity143 skills are certainly one of the important skills that you would want on that swat team -- primarily for law enforcement , primarily for the swat team members , " @entity42 said			0
" we have people who are @entity143 folks , whose primary mission is to take care of the wounded , to be almost in a position of military corpsman or medic , " he said			0
" it 's kind of sad that things have taken a turn that creates the need for this , " he added .			0

training can hardly thwart a surprise gunman or hostage - taker , authorities say
this week , a gunman is killed by police after he takes four @entity11 firefighters hostage
" @entity245 as these situations are , they are relatively rare , " expert says
firefighters in @entity10 , @entity11 , are now working with extra awareness
