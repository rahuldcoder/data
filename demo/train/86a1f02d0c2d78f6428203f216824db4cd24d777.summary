-- a few years ago , when i would tell people that my husband was deployed to @entity6 , they would often respond with , " well , at least he 's not in @entity8 , " a comment i always found ignorant and irritating			1
but now , with the @entity8 war ending , i am grateful that my husband 's deployments were all to @entity6 , to the war that the world -- at least temporarily -- forgot			1
today i am grateful the name " @entity8 " is not in my family 's scrapbooks , our memories or the stories we will pass on to future generations , though my reasoning has nothing to do with the actual fighting that took place there			1
i am grateful because , to many @entity26 , @entity6 is still the " good " war , the one we had to fight			1
@entity8 was the war that many never understood nor supported			1
the @entity8 war was tied up from the start in confusion and wrapped in acronym			1
there were missing wmds and deadly @entity36 , soldiers with @entity38 and @entity39 returning home only to struggle through deplorable conditions at @entity42			0
there was sectarian violence that stretched from mosque to mosque , fueled by centuries - old religious disputes between groups most of us had never even known existed			0
our belief in the goodness of our own people was challenged when perverse pictures from @entity55 appeared on the evening news			0
there were stories of made - up heroism , shortages of body armor , an array of military contractors who were neither soldiers nor civilians but lived instead in a shady gray area -- and there were terrifying kidnappings that tragically often ended in death			2
through it all were earnest - faced troops mugging in @entity73 videos and talking to embedded reporters , slogging through their fourth , fifth and sixth deployments away from their homes and their families			2
the good news -- the neighborhoods that were made safe , the schools and hospitals that were opened , the proud purple - fingered elections -- was often eclipsed by the bad news and the learning curve for @entity26 was steep , too steep			1
pretty soon it all became too much to take			0
so i am happy to have never had a " @entity89 is in @entity8 " sticker on my car because now , nearly nine years after the start of the @entity8 , people do n't shake their heads and look down when i talk of my husband 's deployments			1
they do n't suck in their breaths and say to me , " what a waste			0
" my family does n't have to suffer the comments and opinions of others for our part in a war that was never ours to choose -- at least not now , though i suppose that could still change			2
the thing is , my husband did n't get to decide where he went to fight			0
he signed up for the @entity109 and the @entity109 told him where to go			0
in fact , my husband and i , like many in military families , never thought of the two conflicts as being separate wars			1
to us this war was always one war with two fronts			2
the bullets and the @entity36 killed the same in either country			0
where the plane landed and the deployment began was simply the luck of the draw			0
but now that the war in @entity8 is over , there 's not likely to be a second " @entity132 " banner to herald the end			1
the ticker tape will stay tightly wound			0
the confetti wo n't get thrown and the marching bands will save their energy and their songs for @entity139 parades			0
there will be speeches and praise , kind words and kudos -- and there will undoubtedly be families overjoyed to be together to celebrate the holidays -- even if they have to celebrate a week or two late			0
but the day the @entity8 war ended wo n't be noted on future calendars because the rightness of our involvement in that country still has yet to be determined			1
after nine years of @entity155 looking to us to decide their future , the future perception of @entity26 's presence there now rests almost entirely with the @entity155			1
if their country is better for our sacrifices , history will look kindly on our efforts			0
but if @entity8 falls apart , the time and treasure we spent there -- both monetary and human -- will likely be seen as wasted			1
so , though i 'm glad to not have that @entity8 baggage in my family , i worry now for all my friends who do			2
it is a horrible thing to have given tremendously to a cause that others do not respect			0
our nation 's mission in @entity8 will end this month with full flights of weary soldiers and thousands of tons of gear			2
those who make up the last of @entity26 's fighting force there will come home , unpack and sleep off some of their exhaustion , and then they 'll put their uniforms back on and go right back to work on their military bases			1
it will seem , in many ways , like a war that never happened -- a nearly nine - year - long bad dream			0
i hope that , going forward , @entity26 will keep in mind that the men and women who served in @entity8 did so honorably and nobly and that they and their families sacrificed greatly for our nation			1
they deserve the gratitude of the nation that sent them -- again and again and again -- to war			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity208 .			2

@entity208 : to many @entity26 , @entity6 is the " good " war , as opposed to @entity8
@entity8 was the war that many never understood nor supported , @entity208 says
like many in military families , i never thought of them as being separate wars , she says
@entity208 : i hope @entity26 know that those who served in @entity8 did so honorably and nobly
