his team won the pivotal game 5 - 3			1
" a storybook ending here at @entity14 ! " the announcer told hundreds of spectators at the @entity14 and @entity15			2
a confident prince had predicted he would win the 18 - inch - tall trophy , exclusively created by @entity20 for the match			1
his wife , @entity22 , awarded the trophy cup to @entity3 and his three teammates after the royal couple exchanged congratulatory kisses on both cheeks			1
she also gave @entity20 gifts to all 12 polo players who played on the three teams participating in the six chukkars , or six periods , of saturday 's play			1
before the game , the prince declared he and wife @entity22 arrived at " one of the most beautiful polo grounds anywhere in the world " to raise money for charity and compete			1
" i 'm not a good loser , " he joked with hundreds of guests under a white tent as they prepared to eat lunch , adding he wanted to win			1
three polo teams competed at 3 p.m. pt at the polo club , which is the third - oldest polo facility in the @entity48 and is celebrating its 100th birthday this year			2
" here 's to the next century and a very happy birthday ! " the prince saluted the crowd and the polo club 's leaders at a pre-game reception			2
the @entity57 and @entity58 arrived about noon by helicopter from @entity60 , where they 're staying during their three - day @entity48 visit			1
the duchess was wearing a knee - length dress , without a hat			2
the prince 's visit to the polo grounds was an effort to make a royal sport more accessible to @entity48 accustomed to football and baseball			1
" a major misconception is it is only something princes play , " @entity73 , a player and coach with the @entity75 who said he has played with prince @entity3 , said in an interview with @entity2			1
" it 's not just something you can pick up overnight , but it is something pretty much anyone from any socio - economic strata could play if they just knew more about it , " @entity73 said			2
at his noon reception , the prince highlighted how sport can affect people			1
" @entity22 and i have had a busy few days , so the prospect of being able to let loose this afternoon is wonderful for me , " the prince told his guests			1
" but that 's what sport is all about , be it polo or football -- sorry , i mean soccer -- or whatever your preferred sport is , " he continued , prompting laughter			2
" how sport helps young people to find purpose in life is a key element to the foundation that @entity22 , @entity105 and i have established , " he said			1
saturday 's play benefitted the @entity108 , which was just established in april			2
the foundation supports disadvantaged children and young persons , conservation and sustainable development , and veterans and military families			0
tickets for the lunch and a vip seat to the game cost $ 4,000 each			0
about 400 persons had been expected to buy such tickets , ensuring at least $ 1.6 million being raised for charity			1
before the game , experts said the @entity57 would experience a faster game than he 's used to			0
" there 's huge differences , " @entity73 said			0
" @entity130 in @entity131 is very @entity132 - influenced , and in @entity48 there is a great history of cowboys and riding from their own history out in the @entity137			0
" in @entity131 everyone is very proper and tucked in , " he continued			0
" the game flows out here in @entity48			0
in @entity131 lately , there 's been a lot of stopping and controlling the ball , which kind of slows it up			0
so it will be interesting for @entity3 out in @entity14 to play in a game where it 's really flowing like a pinball game			1
" among those playing saturday was @entity150 , captain of the @entity48 polo team			1
his father and grandfather were professional polo players , and @entity150 grew up playing the sport in @entity156 , @entity157 , where the game is popular , he said			1
the prince played for the @entity160 , sponsored by @entity161 , and @entity150 played on @entity162			2
the @entity163 , currently ranked second in the @entity165 standings , rounded out the three teams playing saturday			1
the prince 's team beat the @entity163 in the final two chukkars			1
the day 's activities included a private drinks reception and three - course luncheon prepared by chef @entity173 , who 's also the granddaughter of film producer @entity174			0
the menu featured sweet corn lasagna with blistered tomatoes as well as a pea pesto and beef tenderloin crostini			0
the lunch benefitted the royal brothers ' charity and the @entity184 of @entity14 , organizers said			2
" in terms of publicity and the sort of hype that this event is getting , i do n't think i 've ever experienced anything " like it , @entity150 said this week , before the match			2
celebrities who came to see the match included actresses @entity195 and @entity197 and game - show host @entity198			2
the game allowed @entity48 to size up how the prince played polo			2
he 's known as being competitive but a good sport , @entity73 said			1
on saturday , the prince had a slow start in his first match , but he finished strong in the second , pivotal game			1
the games opened the summer polo season			0
" will is disciplined , " @entity73 said before the game			0
" one of the aspects of the game is marking , and it 's really important to stay with your man , shadow your man			0
it 's like basketball in that way : always be blocking , always be shadowing your man			0
and @entity212 does that very conscientiously			0
he plays the defensive role			0
" " he takes the man first and then plays the shots to his team , usually defensive shots			0
he 's very good with backhand			2
backhand is when you hit the ball backwards in defense			0
but he can also hit a clean , full , right - up - the - field as well			0
" but when compared to his father , prince @entity234 , @entity3 is " a challenged player , " @entity73 said			1
@entity234 played the game so hard that he often suffered injuries , @entity73 said			0
" @entity234 was crazy , crazy about polo			0
he really loved the game as his father did before him			0
and i think @entity3 loves it , but he also has an eye on many other things like flying helicopters , " @entity73 said			1
as in @entity48 pro sports , polo has its share of " polo wives , " and that would include @entity22 , @entity3 's wife , who will be enjoying the game from the viewing stands			1
" i think @entity58 would enjoy polo because if she did n't , she may not have stuck around , " @entity73 said			0
" you get to know the rules if you are a wife or a girlfriend , so you root for your team			0
she may be holding the spare stick in case it breaks , but it 's my suspicion that there might be someone else doing that on the day			0
" after the game , the royal couple were scheduled to return to @entity60 , where they have been staying since friday , and attend a @entity268 reception and dinner			1
the event will recognize 42 emerging @entity272 artists working in film , television and video games and promote relationships between @entity277 and the @entity272			0
@entity3 is president of @entity268			1
