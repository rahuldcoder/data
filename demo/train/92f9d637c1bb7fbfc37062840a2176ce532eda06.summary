@entity0 -- a group that protects the welfare of animals has released an undercover video it claims shows animal abuse at a @entity8 farm operated by the largest egg producer in the @entity10			1
the @entity11 says one of its investigators worked at the @entity15 farm in @entity16 , @entity8 , for almost a month this fall and documented multiple abuses and food - safety violations			1
the video shows dead birds , birds stuck in their cages , overcrowding and what appears to be hens covered in feces			1
at one point the video shows a dead bird as eggs roll by just inches away on a conveyor belt			1
the short , edited video was shown at a news conference on wednesday by the @entity35 's president and ceo , @entity37			1
" our latest farm animal investigation documents inhumane treatment of laying hens and conditions that threaten food safety , " @entity37 said from the group 's headquarters in @entity0			2
@entity45 told reporters that @entity15 , based in @entity47 , @entity48 , was unaware of the investigation and that the video was being made public for the first time			1
@entity45 said he did n't know if the giant egg company had seen the video			2
@entity15 responded to the allegations with a statement on its website			2
" @entity15 has been a leader in accepting and implementing animal welfare measures			1
all of the @entity60 's facilities are operated in full compliance with existing environmental , health and safety laws and regulations and permits			0
each employee involved in the care and handling of our hens is required to review , sign and comply with our @entity60 code of conduct regarding the ethical treatment of hens which requires employees to report any possible violations , " the statement said			0
the egg industry has taken a beating of late			0
just this summer over half a billion eggs were recalled after a salmonella outbreak was traced to an @entity82 farm			0
@entity15 is no stranger to recalls			2
it recalled 288,000 eggs earlier this month when the @entity86 informed the company that eggs from one of its @entity91 plants tested positive for salmonella enteritidis			0
@entity93 , which is generally contracted from contaminated poultry , meat , eggs , or water , affects the intestinal tract			0
according to the @entity10 @entity101 's @entity100 , chickens can pass the bacteria to eggs because the eggs leave hens through the same passageway as feces			2
alternatively , bacteria in the hen 's ovary or oviduct can get to the egg before the shell forms around it , @entity100 said			0
@entity15 says it sold over 778 million eggs in 2009 , which represents 18 percent of the @entity10 market			1
according to the companies website , " @entity15 has an industry - leading record in food safety with all of its 35 processing plants independently verified as reaching the highest level of safety by the @entity122			2
" over 70 billion eggs are produced a year in the @entity10 , and the @entity35 would like to see the large egg farms change their ways " @entity128 , we 've found that these massive facilities caging hundreds of thousands of animals do not properly care for the birds ... it 's time for the egg industry to embrace cage - free housing systems and move away from battery cage confinement methods , " @entity37 said			1
battery cage systems allow many birds to be housed in one facility but critics claim it 's dangerous and cruel to the animals			0
the @entity35 would like to see cage - free housing but so far only 5 percent of eggs produced in the @entity10 use this method , according to @entity145			1
the @entity86 implemented new rules in july for large egg producers			0
these mandates include cleaning poultry houses that test positive for salmonella , rodent control , refrigeration of eggs during storage and transportation and buying chicks and young hens only from suppliers who monitor for @entity93 bacteria			0
the @entity101 says that as many as 79,000 illnesses and 30 deaths due to consumption of eggs contaminated with the bacterium @entity93 enteritidis may be avoided each year with these new measures in place .			0
