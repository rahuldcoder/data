-- with the selection of cardinal @entity3 , who will be known as @entity4 , the cardinals have sent a signal to the @entity6 about how @entity6 should live in the world			1
@entity3 is known to be a good administrator			2
but he lives very simply in a small apartment and rides a bus			2
he 's well known for his engagement in issues of social justice and in defense of the poor			1
indeed , the very name @entity4 honors @entity17 , a person of humility and deep caring			2
if he is anything like his namesake then this selection is good news indeed			2
and now that he has been named pope , @entity4 will face a raft of advice			1
some will call for improved administration , finding a way to draw new @entity6 into the church where it is in decline , and increasing engagement with other faith traditions			1
opinion : the biggest moment in the world other pundits were thinking in grand terms			2
among the progressives , some believe the church should adopt a bold revolution , with new acceptance of women priests , homosexuality , etc. the @entity48 have a greater chance of winning a @entity50			1
change on controversial issues , if it happens at all , will be slow and incremental , since the church is bound by the requirements of tradition and precedent			1
from the traditional side of @entity59 , expressed in a @entity61 column by @entity62 , hope was for a pope who will be " a charismatic , missionary culture warrior , challenging the world 's democracies to rebuild their moral foundations			1
" the problem here is that in the @entity72 many of the troops are not following the generals			2
for example , 90 % of @entity6 are using contraception and 82 % think it is morally permissible			1
moreover , many @entity72 catholics are more devoted to liberal and conservative political positions than the teachings of the church			0
this poses a serious problem			0
the church has conservative positions on human sexuality , bioethics , etc. , but liberal positions on issues such as economic regulation , the death penalty and immigration			1
a church divided against itself seems unlikely to renew our political or cultural structures			0
news : cardinals elect first pope from @entity98 so , in lieu of grand but seemingly unworkable schemes , i would suggest a much more modest but doable set of proposals to address a spiritual crisis of declining confidence in the institutional church			1
in a recent @entity109 survey of @entity6 in the @entity72 , almost half listed the issues needing to be addressed in the church as the priest sex abuse scandal and a loss of trust			1
what can the church do to resolve the trust problem ? why not begin a transparency and empowerment offensive ? transparency could be improved by placing in the @entity122 lay experts in charge of the priest abuse investigations			1
@entity125 will not be restored by clerics investigating and judging clerics			0
we end up with cardinal @entity129 , who moved and protected pedophile priests , being granted a position of honor in @entity133			0
these kinds of decisions have seriously eroded trust in the pews			2
in the @entity72 , the @entity6 finally awakened and began a process of lay review			1
a female judge and lay investigators restored a degree of trust			1
bring this model to @entity133			0
opinion : @entity4 , humble , authentic and credible eliminating the @entity146 , a source of scandals for many decades , would increase transparency and institutional focus			1
the church is better with the deposit of faith than the faith of deposits			2
turn the funds over to reliable banks subject to international regulatory requirements			0
resolving these transparency issues is based in part on empowering the laity for a greater role			1
and there are other empowerment possibilities			0
the church could allow more flexibility to local bishops and parishes , who can respond creatively to local conditions			0
in a global church , this will assist effective evangelization			0
and why not have women deacons ? this would add more personnel for critical church functions in locations without sufficient priests			2
it would ensure greater access to the sacraments and bring an often - alienated constituency into a critical role offering new gifts to the administration of the church			0
another role for women could be an advisory board to the pontiff on the role of women and women 's issues in the church			1
these proposals for transparency and empowerment are realistic ways to restore faith , hope and charity in the administration of the church			1
they would allow the church to pursue its spiritual mission more effectively and more fully use the gifts of its female members			0
these proposals can succeed because they will not require a radical change in theology , tradition or canon law			0
they require no major shift in doctrine			0
i have one final suggestion to restore hope and trust			1
the church , starting with the example of @entity4 , must embody the virtue of humility			0
it must listen as well as preach			0
consider also the example of cardinal @entity224 of the @entity225 , who does not own a car and eats with workers			0
his words match his humble lifestyle			0
he has said , " ( you ) may be saying the right things but people will not listen if the manner by which you communicate reminds them of a triumphalistic , know - it - all institution			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity238 .			0

@entity240 : the new pope will be getting much advice
he says the pope should build trust , introduce new transparency on range of issues
he says put lay experts in charge of sex abuse probe , eliminate @entity146
@entity240 : @entity6 should empower laity , especially women , and restore faith , hope
