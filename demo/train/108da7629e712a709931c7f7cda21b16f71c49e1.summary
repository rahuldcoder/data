as @entity2 militants battle @entity4 security forces for control of towns and cities not far from @entity8 , the capital has taken on the tense feel of a city under siege			1
there 's a heavy police and military presence on the streets and at checkpoints that sometimes appear to pop up overnight			1
nowhere is the sense of fear more palpable than at @entity19 , where hundreds and hundreds of people wait in long security and check - in lines for one of the few , precious seats available on flights out of @entity4			1
for days , the @entity25 has considered what to do about the militants , and on thursday , @entity25 president @entity28 said he is prepared to send military advisers to @entity4 , adding that @entity25 was not returning to a combat role in the country			1
the @entity33 earlier presented @entity28 with a plan to send up to 100 special forces advisers to @entity4 to work along with that country 's military , several @entity25 officials told @entity38 on thursday			1
the @entity25 withdrew its final troops from @entity4 at the end of 2011 , nearly nine years after leading the invasion of @entity4 that toppled longtime leader @entity42			1
as the @entity44 splinter group @entity43 , or the @entity45 in @entity4 and @entity46 , continues its fierce advance in @entity4 , senior @entity25 officials tell @entity38 that the @entity28 administration is of the belief that prime minister @entity50 is not the leader @entity4 needs to unify the country and end sectarian tensions			1
the officials , along with @entity55 diplomats , say the @entity56 is now focused on a political transition that would move @entity4 toward a more inclusive government -- one without @entity50 that would include @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 factions			2
the chairman of the @entity64 , gen. @entity63 , told @entity65 that the @entity25 has received a request from the @entity4 government to use its air power in the conflict			2
those discussions continued after @entity4 's second - largest city , @entity72 , fell last week to @entity43			1
the militants were barely opposed by @entity4 security forces , many of whom abandoned their weapons and fled their posts			1
airlines adding flights many people at the @entity8 airport are seeking safety in @entity4 's @entity62 - controlled north , particularly @entity85 , or in the southern port city of @entity87			2
others are trying to get out of the country altogether			0
to accommodate the exodus , airlines have begun adding flights and , in some cases , much larger planes			0
still , there are few seats available as most flights , according to travel agencies , are sold out weeks in advance			0
where once there was one @entity104 flight a day to the northern city of @entity85 , there are now three			0
on thursday , a @entity107 flight flew from @entity108 to @entity8 nearly empty			0
but it is oversold for its return , a flight attendant said			0
the fighters are now within 40 miles of the capital , where at least three people were killed and 15 injured thursday when a car bomb and two roadside bombs exploded in three separate areas , police officials there told @entity38			0
a few miles outside of the @entity8 airport , dozens of men waited in lines in the sweltering sun to answer @entity50 's call to join the military 's fight against the @entity60 extremists			2
the prime minister , whose @entity61 - dominated government is accused of fostering sectarian tensions by marginalizing @entity4 's @entity60 and @entity133 minorities , is facing growing calls from some quarters to stand down			2
battle for @entity137 oil refinery meanwhile , @entity4 security forces and @entity2 militants clashed again thursday as they battled for control of the nation 's main oil refinery			1
conflicting reports have emerged as to who has the upper hand			0
in a phone interview on state - run @entity147 on thursday , col. @entity148 , the commander of troops responsible for protecting the refinery in @entity137 , some 140 miles north of @entity8 , said @entity4 armed forces were in full control			1
he said the militants had suffered dozens of casualties in the course of multiple attacks but had failed to take the refinery complex			0
but police officials in @entity160 and @entity8 said @entity43 fighters control 60 % of the oil refinery			1
dozens of vehicles full of militants launched a fresh assault on the sprawling refinery complex around 4 a.m. local time thursday , the police officials said			2
@entity4 security forces are still trying to expel them and regain the control			1
@entity173 television reported that 40 " @entity43 terrorists " were killed during the clashes			2
the @entity137 refinery is a key strategic resource because it refines much of the fuel needed for internal consumption			1
there are already long lines at many gas stations across the country			1
@entity4 is also a major exporter of fuel from oil fields in the country 's south			1
as the @entity190 highlighted the plight of a half - million @entity4 forced from their homes by days of fighting , the @entity189 announced it would give an additional 5 million euros ( $ 6.8 million ) in assistance to @entity4 , taking the total to 12 million euros this year			1
" this fresh wave of violence has terrible consequences for vulnerable children , women and men , " said @entity189 official @entity196			2
militants seize @entity205 complex also on thursday , @entity43 militants took control of a facility @entity42 once used to produce and store chemical weapons			1
but the @entity210 doubts that the @entity205 complex contains any material of " military value			0
" " the materials in the bunkers , which date from the 1980s , are of little military value and would be very difficult to safely move , " @entity210 spokeswoman @entity213 said thursday			0
but " the materials pose serious health hazards to anyone attempting to access the bunkers			0
" calls for change of leadership @entity50 struck a defiant tone wednesday in a televised weekly address , saying @entity4 forces were on the " on the rebound " after their initial shock in the face of the militants ' lightning advance			1
" we will respond and keep the momentum , " @entity50 said			0
but despite @entity50 's words , there 's a growing chorus of calls -- both in @entity239 and in the @entity55 world -- for him to go if there is to be any hope of unifying @entity4 as the islamic militants advance			2
there 's hope that a government bringing the @entity60 and @entity133 into the political process would curb sympathies for @entity43 by those who find themselves on the outside			2
however , @entity50 maintains a strong grip on power and his party recently won national elections			0
the prime minister 's office has not received any official statement asking for him to step down , @entity50 adviser @entity255 told @entity38 on thursday			0
" nobody said this , and we have not received any official statement suggesting that @entity50 has to leave his position , " @entity255 said			0
while some on @entity264 are n't shy about saying his days as the @entity4 leader should come to an end , at the @entity56 it 's more of a whisper			2
the lightning - fast advance by @entity43 has seen large portions of northern @entity4 fall under its control			1
@entity43 wants to establish a caliphate , or @entity274 state , that would stretch from @entity4 into northern @entity46			1
curbing sympathies a change in government in @entity4 ca n't come too soon for some in @entity239 sen. @entity278 , @entity279 , the head of the @entity280 , said @entity50 has to be convinced that it 's in the country 's best interest for him to retire			2
" i think that most of us that have followed this are really convinced that the @entity50 government , candidly , has got to go if you want any reconciliation , " she said this week			0
publicly though , the @entity56 is n't being as direct			0
earlier this week in a @entity292 interview , secretary of state @entity290 said the @entity25 should n't be dictating to the @entity4 people that @entity50 needs to resign			0
" now , we clearly can play an encouraging , consultative role in helping them to achieve that transition , and we have people on the ground right now , " he said			0
@entity25 options on wednesday , @entity28 huddled with congressional leaders , briefing them on options he is considering			0
a few hours earlier , defense secretary @entity302 and @entity63 said they were working out details on possible @entity25 steps that could include airstrikes on @entity60 militants advancing through northern @entity4			0
house speaker @entity308 demanded that @entity28 lay out a " broader strategy " but sidestepped a question about whether he supported airstrikes			0
meanwhile , senate majority leader @entity311 spoke out forcefully against sending @entity25 service members into @entity4			0
" this is an @entity4 civil war , and it is time for @entity4 to resolve it themselves , " he said			0
in their meeting , @entity28 effectively told congressional leaders that while he 'd let them know what was going on , he did n't need any new permission to act in @entity4			1
while a @entity56 statement emphasized that @entity28 would continue to consult with @entity65 , @entity280 @entity322 leader @entity321 said the president " basically just briefed us on the situation in @entity4 and indicated he did n't feel he had any need for authority from us for the steps that he might take			1
" several military sources have confirmed to @entity38 that manned reconnaissance flights over @entity4 to collect up - to - the - minute intelligence on @entity43 movements and positions have begun			1
unmanned reconnaissance flights have been going on already for several days			0
