-- fewer @entity2 adults are smoking , and those who do smoke are on average smoking less , according to a new study in the @entity7			2
smoking rates in the @entity2 have dropped dramatically over the past several decades , falling from 40 % in 1965 to about 20 % in 2006			1
much of that decline is due to a disproportionate decrease in the number of people who smoke at least a pack a day , the study found			0
in 1965 , 56 % of all adult smokers consumed 20 cigarettes or more per day			1
by 2007 , that figure had fallen to 41 %			1
in @entity19 , which has a history of unusually aggressive antismoking programs , the decrease was even larger : only 23 % of all smokers smoked at least a pack a day in 2007 , according to the study , which mined data from two long - running government surveys			2
@entity27 : 15 ways smoking ruins your looks these declines appear to be caused by a combination of heavy smokers quitting altogether and fewer young people ramping up to a pack - a - day - habit , the researchers say			2
the decrease in smoking rates " is all coming out of heavy smokers , " says @entity36 , @entity37 , the lead author of the study and the director of cancer prevention and control at the @entity42 's @entity41			1
" the population [ of smokers ] is changing			0
" the decline in heavy smoking appears to be linked to a subsequent decline in lung cancer			1
in 1993 , when the deaths caused by lung cancer peaked in the @entity2 -- about 15 years after the rates of heavy smoking peaked -- 1 in every 855 deaths was attributable to the cancer			1
by 2007 , lung cancer was responsible for just 1 in every 980 deaths			1
( these figures do not include @entity19 , which had even lower rates			0
) @entity0 : 6 common smoking triggers -- and how to fight them " we knew that lung cancer was caused almost entirely by smoking , and it 's the amount you smoke that matters , " @entity36 says			1
" it was always the heavier smoker that was getting lung cancer			2
" the findings are " great news , " says @entity71 , @entity72 , chief medical officer of the @entity73			0
" this shows the dramatic effect of our smoking cessation and prevention programs			0
this is also a victory for public health and disease prevention agencies , which are generally poorly funded in the @entity2 " the decline in heavy smoking has been especially pronounced in @entity19 , the country 's most populous state			1
in 1965 , 23 % of @entity19 adults smoked 20 or more cigarettes a day , whereas only 3 % smoked that heavily in 2007			1
@entity0 : @entity86 , sneaky , or skinny ? the 7 types of smokers the authors attribute the success in @entity19 to the state 's wide - ranging antismoking efforts			0
the state was the first to substantially raise taxes on cigarettes , the first to institute a comprehensive antismoking program , and the first to banish smoking in workplaces statewide , the study notes			2
in fact , the study itself is a product of the state 's antismoking efforts			0
the research was funded with grants from the @entity42 that , by law , are supported by state cigarette taxes			0
in addition , one of the study 's coauthors , @entity113 , is the chief of evaluation for the @entity116 , a division of the state department of public health whose budget is funded with the same taxes			0
despite the progress seen in the study , @entity71 cautions that the fight to reduce smoking is far from over			0
" twenty percent of @entity2 adults still smoke and tobacco is still causing lots of major disease , " he says			2
" we should not use this news to declare victory , but be encouraged by the success of our actions so we can vigorously press on to reduce the use of tobacco further			0
