-- when @entity1 shot @entity3 point blank in the head in last season 's finale of " @entity7 , " viewers were shocked : how could a father figure kill his surrogate son ? but this is the land of gangsters and bootleggers , and blood is n't the currency here -- it 's alcohol			1
that episode , " @entity18 , " nabbed an emmy nomination for director @entity20 ( amongst its many other nods , including best drama and best actor for @entity25 ) , but it also signified a tonal shift in how the characters on this prohibition - era drama would operate in the next season , which kicks off sunday , september 16 on @entity30 : no more mr. @entity31			1
as the show jumps ahead to @entity33 in 1922 , " the stakes are higher , " said showrunner @entity34			1
" the ' 20s had really started to roar , so it 's when radio was everywhere , music made the charts , and the flapper as we know her started to come out , " @entity34 said			1
" the economy had started to boom , which lead to young people buying cars and traveling more from home			1
and while a lot of people had stockpiled alcohol , by 1923 , they were running out , so there was a lot more competition ( in bootlegging ) and it became a lot more violent			1
it 's the era of the tommy - gun			1
" so while @entity1 survived an attempted coup on his market share last season , in order to stay on top , he has to try new strategies , which includes streamlining -- instead of selling to multiple buyers , he wants to sell to only one -- and those cut out of the supply line are none too pleased , including a hot - tempered new antagonist named @entity71 , played by @entity72			1
" a guy like that , he 's got such a hair trigger , you could end up dead over something you said that you did n't even know was taken as an insult , " @entity34 said			1
" there 's an upcoming line where @entity1 says , ' @entity71 can find an insult in a bouquet of roses			1
' " the audience 's introduction to @entity71 comes when he has car trouble , and he requires assistance to fix his tire from a helpful stranger who is out walking his dog to fix his tire			1
the pooch plays a role in what follows and it 's the type of touch that may give audiences some pretty good insight into @entity71 's character			1
" it 's a very funny idea , " @entity72 said			1
" you get to see guys like @entity1 who are more professional in the way they go about their work , and this guy , it seems like he might be in the wrong profession , you know ? he 's got a lot of zingers , which is good , because that 's how i 'm like in real life			1
my favorite line is when i call @entity25 ( @entity25 ) ' a breadstick with a bow tie			1
' " @entity1 takes that one in stride , for now -- but he 's not too keen on taking any guff from his wife @entity118 anymore , as he 's not about to forgive her actions last season , when she signed over a tract of land he bought between @entity126 and @entity127 to the @entity128 shortly after their wedding ceremony			2
their union is now a shaky one , and @entity118 finds herself in a tricky position			2
" i 'm just delighted that she 's not passive anymore , " said @entity134 , who plays @entity118			2
" she knows how to look after herself , and she 's becoming stronger			2
you never quite know where she 's going to go next			2
" married or not , @entity138 shares his bed with new flapper / showgirl @entity141 , played by @entity144			2
" she 's a fun girl , " @entity145 said of her character			2
" the flappers were n't feminists , but they were enjoying the new - found feminism			2
so she 's living life to the fullest , and she has her own apartment , her own life			2
she 's not as needy as ( @entity138 's former mistress ) @entity156 was			2
" speaking of @entity156 , @entity34 said it 's " a long shot " that we 'll see her again , even if her child is now being raised by @entity162 's character			2
the disgraced @entity164 agent @entity163 is now living under an assumed name as a door - to - door salesman in @entity167 , @entity168 , which puts him in proximity with @entity173 's power base			2
" i do n't have a gun , and i do n't make whiskey in my bathtub , so i do n't identify with these people much ! " @entity162 laughed			0
" but @entity163 is still in hiding			0
" " he 's constantly dealing with the fact that he could be caught , arrested , and sent to jail for the rest of his life , " the actor added			0
" he 's got a family to take care of			0
and he lost a pretty good job , so now he 's faced with a pretty harsh economic reality , because it 's a hard time to make a living and support yourself			1
i do n't think he can really see himself as a lawman anymore			0
" like @entity72 's character , @entity163 is now in a position that 's ripe for both tragedy and comedy , particularly when he accidentally walks into a turf war between @entity173 and @entity196 , a real - life adversary of @entity173 's who also worked as a florist			0
" even if the storyline is dark or something bad happens , it does n't mean it 's not fun to do it , " @entity162 said			0
" but @entity163 is never going to have an easy time on this show			1
that 's not why he 's on the show			1
he 's a tragic character , and the tragedy is going to unfold			0
" still reeling from their own personal tragedy , in the aftermath of the deaths of both @entity3 and @entity212 , @entity213 and @entity214 are raising @entity215 together			0
this is not without some tension , since @entity213 wants to be considered @entity219 's mother , not his grandmother , while @entity214 tries to help the boy remember @entity212			0
" i 've become the surrogate au pair , for a lot of it , " said @entity222 , who plays @entity214			0
" i would think @entity212 would want @entity219 to be very far away from @entity213 and the kind of opportunities of what that show is about , " laughed @entity226 , who played @entity212			1
" @entity214 is the better parent for @entity219			0
" but @entity213 being @entity213 , has always got a scheme up her sleeve			0
" for her , it 's about power , " said @entity233			0
" it 's really fun , because that 's not where i love			0
i 'm not really an angry person			0
but she 's trying to figure out her next move			0
it comes out as the season unfolds			0
" could that mean a revenge plot against @entity138 for killing @entity3 and leaving his son an orphan ? an alliance between @entity163 and @entity173 ? who will be in power and who will die ? the cast wo n't reveal trade secrets , but they all hint the new season will be more explosive than the last			0
" it 's an amazing time for tv drama , " showrunner winter said			1
" it 's daunting to even think we 're competing against " @entity258 , " " @entity259 , " " @entity260 , " " @entity261 , " and " mad men " in any category , let alone best drama			0
it 's thrilling , and i do n't even mean to sound humble			0
" " was i disappointed about @entity162 ? @entity34 said , referring to @entity266 , who did n't get nominated for his portrayal of @entity3			0
yes , because he was terrific , but who knows how this works ? and we have an amazing supportive cast -- @entity272 , @entity162 , @entity273 , any other @entity162 on the show			1
and you do n't have to be named @entity162 to be on the show anymore			1
you can be named @entity72			0

" @entity7 " returns on sunday on @entity30
