what do you give the sheik who 's already checked palaces and private planes off his royal wish list ? how about a menagerie of exotic animals ? that 's partly the story of how a @entity10 of indigenous and introduced species came to populate sir @entity12 , once an inhospitable salt dome island in the @entity14			1
part of @entity18 emirate , the previously private royal playground now welcomes visitors seeking an @entity14 safari experience combined with an encounter with that non-indigenous desert species , the multi-star luxury hotel			1
animal - loving emir the founder and first ruler of the @entity28 , sheik @entity25 started collecting many of the species now thriving in the island 's huge wildlife park after , so the story goes , being given a bevy of exotic creatures as a gift when exploring @entity37 as a young royal			1
long before cheetahs , giraffes , @entity42 hedgehogs -- and well - heeled tourists -- were introduced to sir @entity12 , however , @entity25 was transforming the island with a particular aim : to save a native species that had virtually been wiped out			1
the @entity14 oryx , a kind of antelope , was officially declared extinct in the wild in the late 1960s			1
its plight moved the animal - loving emir to begin developing sir @entity12 ( named after the local @entity54 tribe ) as a place to protect it			1
only the oryx " the oryx is the main reason the island is the way it is today , " says @entity57 , an adventure guide who familiarizes visitors staying on sir @entity12 with its many resident creatures			1
" @entity25 searched the world to see if there were any oryx in captivity			1
" he found a handful and started a breeding program here			0
" to prepare the island for those few remaining antelope in the early 1970s , the late sheik launched an extravagant project that might now be seen as a precursor to other slightly incongruous @entity79 behemoths , such as @entity81 's indoor ski resort			0
he decided literally to make the desert bloom			1
once desert , now forest hundreds of thousands of trees , including acacia , ghaf ( the national tree of the @entity28 ) , frankincense , gum and mangrove were planted in the desert scrubland of the 87 - square - kilometer island to create a habitat for the oryx and other animals			1
the first trees did n't fare so well			0
the antelope nibbled away at them a bit too eagerly , and they had to be replanted			0
they 've since grown to a forest of 4 million , irrigated by desalinated water pumped through an undersea pipeline from the mainland , giving the island an improbably green sheen in this desert environment			2
as for the oryx , " now we have around 500 on sir @entity54 , " @entity57 explains			1
the herd has become healthy enough that animals bred on the island are released into the desert wilds of the mainland			2
indeed , some species have come to feel so at home in the wildlife park that other animals have been brought in to keep their numbers down			2
cheetahs were shipped over to eat the @entity14 sand gazelle , which they hunt in the wild , @entity123 and jackals were brought in to clean up anything the big cats left			1
animal spectacle all of this makes for a great spectacle			0
only a limited number of visitors were allowed on the island when the wildlife park was established in the 1970s			0
the weekend tours became so popular they had to be booked more than a year in advance			0
since @entity25 's death , in 2004 , sir @entity12 has gradually become more accessible			2
reached by a 50 - seat plane from @entity81 or @entity18 , or a 250 - kilometer drive from the @entity28 capital followed by a ferry crossing , sir @entity12 recreates a wilderness , but you wo n't be staying in a tent			2
accommodation is in one of three luxury resorts , meaning the wind - down from exploring the wildlife park on a safari - style drive , by foot on a guided walk or by mountain bike , is pretty pampered			1
wild drives " you can get really close to the animals on the wildlife drives , " @entity57 says			0
" i 've driven along and the cheetahs have been five meters from the car			0
" guided wadi hikes in the mountains , nature walks on the southeast of the island and mountain biking inside and outside the park are even more direct ways of experiencing the territory			0
" each offers the chance to find different animals in different habitats , " @entity57 says			0
the animals are the main attraction for most visitors , but you can also kayak along the mangrove shores or scuba dive off the island			2
funnily enough , one of animal you wo n't spot on sir @entity54 is a camel			1
these ships of the desert do well enough on the mainland without needing the island 's protection they were also probably never a terribly original idea as a gift for a royal sheik			2
getting there @entity196 ( +971 2 444 3366 ) flies from @entity18 and @entity81 to sir @entity12 , with single fares starting from $ 54			0
become chummy enough with the @entity18 royal family and you might get an invitation to one of two palaces they maintain in the island 's southern section			0
failing that there are three resorts on the island , with accommodation ranging from rooms in a former royal palace to upscale villas , all run by @entity214 ( +971 2 801 5400 ) , which can also arrange day trip tours			2
rooms from around $ 220 a night			0
