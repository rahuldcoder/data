-- @entity2 's a-list is a very tough club to crack , and membership is limited to stars of vast appeal with worldwide fame			2
@entity8 may soon get his invitation to join			1
" i think @entity8 is the biggest actor in the world , it 's just people do n't know it yet , " said @entity10 , director of the new action - adventure movie " @entity13 , " which features @entity8 in the lead role			1
@entity8 plays the film 's wisecracking space cowboy @entity18 ( aka " @entity18 " ) who is as deadly accurate with a one - liner as he is with his trusty " element gun			1
" " he 's got that old - time charm of @entity25 , " @entity10 said			2
" he 's got the vulnerability of a very modern actor			2
he 's a big masculine guy that can definitely beat the crap out of any other movie star out there			1
... there 's nobody else out there like him			2
" nobody else his age , perhaps			2
" we 're seeing this new leading man that reminds me of someone like a @entity43 , " said @entity37 , @entity8 's co-star in " guardians			1
" at 35 , @entity8 is slightly less than half the age of @entity46 ( 72 ) , another actor launched to stardom by a space opera -- " @entity49 " @entity8 seems unfazed by all the fuss being made over him as @entity2 's potential @entity51			1
" you know , i feel like , jeez , it 's been cool , it 's been really cool , " @entity8 stammered when asked about all the attention he 's receiving within the industry			1
" i came to @entity2 expecting to do everything but not really knowing what that looked like , " he told @entity0			0
" so i was just as excited when i got my first commercial as i am now , you know what i mean ? i have enjoyed this entire journey , the whole time i have been at this for 15 years			0
my enthusiasm has been turned up to 10 since about 2001 when i did n't have to be a waiter anymore			0
" the tables have certainly turned since @entity8 was waiting tables			1
his early credits came via television shows including " @entity71 " and " @entity72 " his career got a big boost in 2009 when he was cast on the @entity76 sitcom " @entity77 , " playing the daft but likeable @entity78			2
his movie roles were initially confined to supporting parts such as in 2009 's " @entity81 , " 2011 's " what 's @entity83 " ( starring his wife , actress @entity84 ) and 2012 's " the five - year engagement			0
" if starring roles eluded him , it may have been that he did n't have a classic leading man 's physique			0
according to @entity92 , the 6 ' 2 " actor 's weight in the past five years has fluctuated between 220 and 295 pounds			0
@entity92 dubbed him " portly			0
" @entity8 told the magazine he initially turned down the opportunity to audition for the @entity96 part in " guardians			1
" " i was probably scared and thought i was too fat to play a superhero , " he said			1
" @entity13 ' " director @entity10 apparently agreed			0
" when ( casting director ) @entity101 first brought him up to me , i said , ' the chubby guy from " @entity77 " ? are you kidding me ? ' " @entity10 said			0
" there was like no way			0
" but @entity8 had already demonstrated he could lose weight and firm up for a role -- to play a professional baseball player in " @entity109 " ( 2011 ) and a @entity110 in " @entity111 " ( 2012 )			1
and @entity10 was won over by @entity8 's audition			1
" he came in and within 20 seconds , i knew this was our guy , " @entity10 said			0
" i just knew it in my gut			0
" with the role his , @entity8 set about reshaping his body			1
according to press notes compiled by the studio , @entity8 " collaborated with , and was closely monitored by , a team of trainers and nutritionists , training for four hours a day , sticking to a strict diet , taking the right supplements and vitamins , all of which he continued throughout the five - month shoot			1
" the results are plain to see on screen : @entity8 bares his washboard abs in " guardians " ( although it must be said he 's not the most muscular guy in the film ; that honor would have to fall to former pro wrestler @entity137 , who plays the @entity139 - like " @entity138 " )			1
of course it takes more than a hot bod to land on @entity2 's a-list			0
on screen , @entity8 displays a rare ability to relate to audiences and an appealing naturalness that sets him apart from other actors			1
he 's also been hitting all the right notes with fans lately , from french braiding an intern for " @entity153 's " hair during an interview to sharing the deeply personal story of how his son 's premature birth in 2012 affected his faith			0
and despite his emerging star status , he comes across as both self - assured and modest in assessing what he brought to the role and what he needed to learn			2
" the comedy is something i can do , " @entity163 observed			0
" i have been honing in on that skill in ' @entity77 ' for seven seasons			0
i have always prided myself in being a comedic person -- it comes kind of easily to me			0
... but it would be like the suspense and the adventure stuff , like the big movie one liners , that to me -- i had a hard time wrapping my head around that			2
that was a challenge for me			0
" @entity8 's stock in @entity2 looks like it will continue to rise			1
he is filming " @entity182 , " expected to be a blockbuster next summer			1
a sequel to " the @entity188 " appears likely ( he provided the voice of the lead character , @entity185 ) and @entity186 has already ordered a sequel to " @entity13			2
" for now , @entity8 appears to be keeping his newfound success in perspective			1
" this is just another nice exciting chapter ... for me , " he said			0
" it 's exciting and i 'm definitely enjoying the ride so far			0

@entity8 is being touted as the " next big thing "
he thought he was too fat for " guardians " lead role
