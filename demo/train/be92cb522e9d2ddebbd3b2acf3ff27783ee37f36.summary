@entity0 -- with the latest failed cease - fire quickly becoming a distant memory , the two sides in the @entity3 traded rockets and airstrikes saturday -- as well as blame for not stopping the bloodshed			1
@entity13 airstrikes killed at least five more people in @entity0 on saturday , the official @entity11 news agency @entity10 reported			1
the area around central @entity0 's @entity17 mosque , in particular , was a frenzy of activity as medical workers sifted through rubble there			2
@entity10 claimed that @entity13 fighter jets struck that mosque and another , killing at least three people			2
less than a mile away from the @entity17 mosque , a strike killed two men riding on a motorbike , @entity26 spokesman dr. @entity25 said			0
@entity13 's military confirmed the strike , saying the two men were militants			1
@entity34 added saturday night that a 13 - year - old girl died in an airstrike on her family home in @entity38			1
that was in addition to a 10 - year - old boy who died while playing with friends , the @entity11 health ministry said			1
then again , @entity13 is on the defensive as well			2
the @entity45 said that , since the end of the cease - fire early friday , about 100 rockets were fired toward @entity13 from @entity0			1
that figure includes at least 30 launched saturday , of which 24 hit @entity13 , the military said			2
the @entity45 responded by targeting " some 120 terror sites and nine terror operatives			0
" all this back - and - forth , of course , is nothing new			0
the @entity13 and @entity11 -- particularly @entity55 , the @entity57 militant group and political party that controls @entity0 -- have been at it for weeks , with the former fending off persistent rocket attacks and the latter dealing with relentless @entity13 strikes			1
there have been efforts to halt the bloodshed as well as to broach some of the thorny issues related to it			0
and there have been some breakthroughs , including a few cease - fires			1
yet none of those peacemaking attempts , so far , has stuck			0
death toll 's rise slows the death toll 's climb has slowed since @entity45 announced overnight into saturday an end of its ground incursion in @entity0 -- even as it continued to strike from the air			1
@entity13 forces say troops redeployed after completed their mission of destroying @entity55 ' tunnels			1
still , while there were n't scores of dead saturday as has been true many other days over the past few weeks , the total carnage remains significant			0
according to @entity25 , at least 1,911 in @entity0 have died since the conflict began , in addition to just under 10,000 injured			2
it 's unclear how many casualties were militants : the @entity91 estimates that about 70 % of the dead were civilians , or about 1,340			0
@entity45 , meanwhile says about 900 militants have been killed , which would put the civilian death toll at around 1,000			0
@entity45 spokesman lt. col. @entity96 said that that number was a preliminary estimate based on field reports from troops returning from battle			0
@entity13 officials say 64 @entity13 soldiers have died , and three civilians were killed in @entity13			2
the @entity106 missile defense system has intercepted many of the rockets @entity110 militants have fired at populated areas of the country			0
blame game continues besides the violence , another thing that has n't stopped is the blame game			0
one point of contention : who broke the most recent cease - fire hours before it was supposed to run out ? @entity55 denied firing rockets into @entity13 on friday			1
yet militants from @entity124 and the @entity125 admitted to doing just that -- blaming @entity13 for refusing to accept their demands during negotiations			0
@entity13 government spokesman @entity129 said it was @entity55 ' fault regardless , telling @entity1 the group runs @entity0 and " ca n't outsource terrorism to the other groups			1
when they want to enforce a cease - fire , they do it very well			1
" @entity55 has been in charge of the @entity11 government in @entity0 for years , while the @entity11 faction @entity141 runs the government in the @entity143			1
the two groups have been at odds but also made repeated efforts at a unity government , including one earlier this year			0
one sad irony of all this bloodshed is that -- according to the @entity152 foreign ministry , which brokered recent talks -- the parties have reached an agreement on most issues			0
those not agreed upon were few and limited , the ministry said in a statement			0
still , there 's too much history to show that agreement on some issues will not necessarily lead to a grander breakthrough			0
the @entity11 have asked for @entity13 to lift its blockade on @entity0 and to re-open the air and seaports , a @entity11 negotiation who spoke on condition of anonymity said			1
@entity13 authorities fear @entity55 could import weapons by sea and maintains a ship blockade off @entity0 's shores			1
palestinians also wanted @entity13 to extend @entity0 's fishing zone in the @entity177 from three miles off the coast to 20			1
fishing is a keystone of @entity110 livelihoods			0
but @entity13 was willing to extend fishing rights to only six miles off the coast , said @entity55 spokesman @entity184			2
yet @entity13 is resisting in - depth talks as long as rockets continue to head toward its territory			2
after @entity110 rocket fire on friday , @entity13 's @entity188 said the country " will not conduct negotiations while under fire			2
" @entity1 exclusive : inside the mind of @entity55 ' political leader @entity198 laureate @entity196 : @entity55 must stop using children as human shields @entity0 conflict : can economic isolation ever be reversed ? life in @entity0 : misery heightened by war @entity1 's @entity205 reported from @entity0 , @entity206 reported from @entity207 ; @entity208 and @entity209 wrote and reported from @entity210			1
@entity1 's @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215 also contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity11 official : 13 - year - old girl killed by @entity13 airstrike
new : @entity13 military : about 100 rockets from @entity0 since cease - fire 's end
@entity13 and @entity55 *criticize* one another for not doing more to halt violence
