@entity49 said a search of her apartment turned up cocaine , though prosecutors told the court traces of what was believed to be heroin also were present			0
" she 's tied to this case because there was a confidential informant who placed sales of narcotics â € ” heroin â € ” from , i guess , an adjacent apartment , " he said			2

but i can be very adamant that my client had nothing to do with the sales			0

" he 's never met , spoken to , seen , had anything to do with @entity6 , " @entity102 , speaking outside court , said of his client			2
" my client is in no way connected to mr. @entity6 's overdose and there has been no evidence presented that i know of that connects my client to mr. @entity6 in any way , except that he lived in a building which apparently mr. @entity6 frequented a different apartment to do whatever he did			0
" he added , " @entity10 is looking forward to turning his life around and resolving this matter			1
his parents are relieved that he 's been released on these misdemeanor charges , which i think will be resolved favorably for my client			1

@entity36 had a wife and daughter , said the neighbor , who lived in the building years ago			0
" he used to practice at night , " said the ex-neighbor , recalling that @entity36 played keyboards			0
" honestly , he seemed like a nice guy , always playing music			0
