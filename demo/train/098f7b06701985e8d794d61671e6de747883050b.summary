-- on friday , @entity1 posted a photo to her @entity4 account of her teenage son , @entity5 , throwing a punch in a boxing ring with the caption : " nobody messes with @entity10 ! @entity11 said knock you out ! " she wrote below the picture , adding the hashtag " # disniâ € ” a. " yes , of course			1
when the inevitable public outcry began of her use of the n - word , the photo was deleted and reposted , its caption replaced with , in true @entity1 fashion , " # get off my dâ € ” k haters ! " none of this furor is accidental			1
the pop icon is no stranger to controversy , but now it may be time to examine the consequences of her latest cultural tourism in the name of reinvention			1
in each of her many visual incarnations and cultural flings , @entity1 has been predictably parasitic			1
she shamelessly moves on to the next character , having usurped all the cool or controversial parts of the previous one			2
now , there is her use of the n - word			2
this lack of concern for the impact of her words is especially troubling because of her rainbow coalition of children , adopted and biological			1
but this is @entity1 we 're talking about			1
as rumors of a possible performance with @entity54 © at the @entity55 next month swirl , it make sense that she 's crept back into the news			2
this is the woman who embraced her title as the @entity62 decades ago			0
this is the woman who bared all for her widely banned coffee table book " @entity69 , " released alongside the " erotica " album in 1992			0
she has performed hanging from a cross , criticized the @entity73 and masturbated both on stage and in movies			0
@entity76 may live for the applause , but @entity1 no doubt lives for the uproar			1
she is as adept at generating headlines as she is at churning out chart - topping albums			0
and she 's more likely to respond with a middle finger than a heartfelt apology			2
she stands firm in her decisions and historically does n't back down from her statements			0
i previously valued that very quality in her			0
@entity1 : ' n - word ' hashtag was ' term of endearment ' to son as a dancer and former aspiring choreographer , i appreciate the bold spectacle in @entity1 's live shows			1
her wildly successful @entity97 , for example , demonstrated the penchant for pushing creative boundaries that has kept me on board even when critics abandoned her			0
but even that fandom comes with reservations			0
it 's expected that influences change as musical trends and interests shift			2
but @entity1 ? she has put in overtime to earn her status as cultural tourist - in - chief , cherry - picking the most catchy , marketable aspects of her current host culture for commercial benefit with little regard for integrity or respect of the reception to her behavior			1
when she offended @entity121 by wearing a bindi , which is symbolic of chastity and purity , while wearing a see - through top at a @entity127 performance , a spokesperson told @entity128 that @entity1 did not " understand why [ they ] are upset			1
" she defended her use of @entity132 imagery during her @entity133 as being used to highlight " the intolerance humans have for one another			0
" @entity1 has repeatedly demonstrated that she views cultural iconography , from dance styles to religious symbols , as artistic statements and sets them aside when no longer convenient			1
in her early days , she mimicked @entity141			0
then came her @entity143 fixation in the late 1980s with " @entity144			0
" in 1990 , she introduced voguing to the world , a dance style made popular by gay black and @entity148 creators			0
then came bindis , saris , funky henna tattoos and ambiguous prayer - chanting magic on her " @entity154 " album			0
she was a butt - kicking female @entity156 type on the artwork of " @entity158			0
" each image immaculately styled , each revamp merely enduring the life cycle of her current fascination			0
using the n - word on @entity4 is just @entity1 being @entity1			1
and her " i 'm sorry if you were offended " - style nonapology does n't indicate that she 's learned anything from the backlash			2
would she defiantly brush off the same " term of endearment " were it directed to her black children adopted from @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173 ? has she become overly comfortable , having black friends , peers and black children ? this incident is less about @entity1 being a racist and more about her continued lack of tact			1
this would make a great teachable moment for her children about mistakes and consequences , in her latest reinvention as a humanitarian and mother			1
but it should first be a lesson for @entity1 herself			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194 .			2

@entity1 's recent controversy should not be a *surprise* , the *author* says
@entity194 : this is the latest in a career that borrows from what is " cool " in culture
now , as a mother , perhaps she should consider the impact on her children
