-- when i have spare time , one of my favorite ways to be of little - to - no use to society is going on @entity7 and harnessing the power of the " @entity10 " button			1
you click it and it pulls up just one entry from among tens of millions			2
and sometimes it even has facts ! @entity7 's unofficial motto : " sure ... what that guy wrote			1
" as the name implies , when you click for a random article , you never know what you 're going to get			1
but it 's always the start of a fascinating ride down the giant time - wasting wiki wormhole where , as you click on more and more associated articles , an hour later you find you 've somehow gone from , say , learning about electromagnetic radiation to reading up on @entity32			1
and then you eventually leave the wormhole because your brain has gone far too long without porn or cat videos			1
so , anyway , this week , for a little change of pace , instead of writing about a trending topic in social media , i 'm going to click the " @entity10 " button just once and write about the very first thing that pops up			1
no matter what it is			2
because , you know , if it 's on @entity7 , it matters			1
ok , here we go			2
" give me a click , @entity50			2
one click only , please			0
" ( click ) and our topic is : @entity53 ! according to @entity7 , @entity53 is a 24 - year - old professional ice hockey player from @entity54 , @entity55			1
which is nowhere near @entity57			0
now , if you 're not a hockey fan , please do n't turn away			1
i promise i wo n't make this all about sports			0
the whole point of exploring random articles is to see where the wormhole takes you on the @entity69 , to learn about new things and hopefully not end up watching a @entity72 video on @entity73			1
) so let 's learn ! a quick visit to his team 's website does n't reveal anything overly interesting about @entity53 other than the fact that he 's a forward who 's 185 centimeters tall and weighs 82 kilograms			1
i 'm an @entity83 so , clearly , i have no idea what the hell that means			0
for all i know he 's 5 feet 3 inches and built like a @entity88			2
or as they call that on internet dating sites : " @entity90			0
" so , i used @entity93 's metric converter and learned that he 's actually about 6 feet tall and weighs roughly 180 pounds			1
which sounds just about right for a real professional hockey player			1
by contrast , i played one season of club hockey my freshman year in college , but was 5 feet 9 inches and built like a malnourished fifth - grader			2
so i quit , took up sleeping in as my new club sport and decided to concentrate on pork rinds			0
i became : " @entity90			0
" but back to @entity53			1
his current team hails from the town of @entity107 , which is in the southeastern part of the @entity55			1
you 're allowed to not know where it is			0
so do look at that map			0
and maybe even plan a visit			0
@entity107 actually sounds rather interesting			0
in 2007 , @entity116 writer @entity115 called @entity107 " an architectural gold mine " and mentioned that people used to joke about it being " a piece of @entity83 , somehow misplaced here in the @entity55			1
" the architectural history of @entity107 has roots in @entity83 , and dates back to the larger vision of a local shoemaker in the early 1900s			2
his name was @entity127 and , according to the article , he made several discovery trips to the @entity83 , and even toured @entity131 factories to learn more about the intricacies of mass production			0
@entity127 came away from his visits to @entity83 with big ideas ( and probably high cholesterol ) , and set forth to not only mass - produce his shoes , but to also mass - produce buildings specifically designed to enhance the lives of his workers			0
maybe even a @entity143 's and a vd clinic			2
but @entity127 wanted to do it in style			0
so , the article says , he enlisted the help of some of @entity152 's most radical architects			2
" tell me , @entity153			0
what do you envision for the hospital ? " " no walls			0
and we 'll surround the exterior with open flames to symbolize the warmth of healing			0
how about just a fancy door			0
" eventually , @entity127 's dream fizzled , but most of the buildings made it through the great wars and are still intact today			2
thus , the " architectural gold mine			0
" though , if you 're @entity53 , @entity107 is probably just some place where you now play hockey			1
and that brings us right back where we started			0
the " @entity10 " button			1
we began with a relatively unknown @entity55 hockey player and ended up learning about how an enterprising shoemaker influenced the architecture of an entire city -- just a short example of the wiki wormhole			1
and the best part : no @entity72 ! ( warning ! do not click this			1

" @entity192 " is @entity190 's weekly *skewed* look at social media
this week , @entity194 dives down the wormhole of @entity7 's " @entity10 " tool
@entity55 hockey player @entity53 was the random page
what followed ? @entity55 history , metric equations and , *gladly* , no @entity72
