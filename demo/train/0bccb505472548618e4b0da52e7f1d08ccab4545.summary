-- when @entity2 came up with his audacious plan to fly around the world in an aircraft powered only by the sun , he found that airplane manufacturers were skeptical such a plane could be built			1
so who built the first model of " @entity12 , " @entity2 's $ 72 - million solar - powered craft ? a company that makes ships			1
@entity2 , who won the first transatlantic balloon race and commanded the first balloon flight around the world , told @entity0 , " each time we asked the aeronautical industry to build that airplane , they told us it 's impossible			1
we can not make an airplane so light and so big			2
so who did we ask for some help ? a boat manufacturer			2
they had no idea it was impossible , so they built the pieces in carbon fiber and now we have an airplane			2
" the plane is made by the @entity36 company @entity35 , which made the @entity37 - winning @entity38			1
" people put limitations on their creativity , believing they have to rely on what they know and what they have done , " @entity2 says			1
he sees the @entity12 venture as a way to dramatically demonstrate that it 's possible to make a sharp break with the past -- in this case , by showing that renewable energy can replace fossil fuel			1
" a lot of industries say we have a society based on oil dependency , so let 's continue			2
... we know how to deal with oil			2
the result is @entity59 and @entity60 going bankrupt			0
it 's a typical example of people who did not make the turnaround early enough			0
if @entity59 made engines with much lower fuel consumption , they would not have gone bankrupt			1
" " we have to get rid of certainties , habits , paradigms , common assumptions , " @entity2 says			1
" these are the limits to creativity			0
" @entity2 , who is 51 , spoke about his new venture at the @entity75 conference in july 2009 and elaborated on it in a recent interview with @entity0			1
@entity0 : why are you interested in attempting to fly around the world in a solar airplane ? @entity2 : my life and the life of my family has to do with exploration , with adventure			1
my grandfather was the first man in the stratosphere , and my father was the first to touch the deepest point in the ocean			0
... for me adventure and exploration is something in the blood			0
so that 's why i flew around the world in a balloon in 1999			1
... it was considered to be impossible , i said , " let 's try it			0
" i succeeded after two failures , and i came to the middle of my life , thinking now that adventure has to go on , and a pioneering sprit has to go on , but how can the adventure be useful -- not a personal dream like flying around the world in a balloon -- but really useful ? i came up with idea of a solar airplane flying around the world with no fuel -- that would be a beautiful message in terms of technology , the energy of the future and the environment			1
@entity0 : so what is the status of the effort right now ? @entity2 : so the airplane is built			1
the first flight was achieved on the third of december and in the spring and summer this year , we 're going to make the high - altitude flights and the cycle of [ flying ] one day , one night and one day			1
we take off in the morning			0
we climb to 27,000 feet , and at the same time we load the batteries and run the engines on solar power only			1
then we fly through the night on the batteries in order to reach the next sunrise and continue the following day			1
so this makes a complete cycle , with no fuel			2
when this will be achieved , we will build a second airplane that will be able to cross the @entity139 and fly around the world			1
the first airplane has to prove that it 's possible to fly a complete cycle , one day , one night , one day			2
... this little airplane is not a @entity145 or @entity146 with a couple of solar cells			2
it 's a really high - tech carbon fiber airplane which is 200 feet in wingspan			2
so it has basically the wingspan of a jumbo jet 747 , it has the weight of a little car , and on average it can fly with the energy of a little motorcycle -- which is only provided by the sun. ... if an airplane like this can fly day and night with no fuel , then nobody can say in the future that it is impossible to use the same technology for cars , for heating systems , for air conditioning , for electronics and so on			1
@entity0 : how fast will the plane travel ? @entity2 : the plane will travel very slowly			1
otherwise it would take too much energy			2
the average speed will be 40 knots , roughly 55 miles per hour			0
@entity0 : and so a flight around the world will take how long ? @entity2 : it would take around 20 days and because there is only one pilot at a time in the cockpit , we 're going to land every five days and change the pilot			1
... when @entity184 crossed the @entity139 in 1927 , he was alone on board , and the airplane was full of gasoline and nobody thought than an airplane could take passengers over the @entity139			0
and 30 years later , airplanes were taking 200 passengers across the @entity139			0
so now we start the same thing over again , but with no fuel			2
we need an airplane that is very big , that is very light , and full of batteries , lithium polymer batteries , and it can take only one person			0
we have to see afterward if the technology can improve -- and transport people			0
but our goal is more to bring about a revolution in behavior than to bring a revolution in aviation			0
the goal is really to have people on ground who will follow this adventure and will start to use the same technologies , to save energy and to rely on renewable energy			1
@entity0 : what is the biggest technical challenge in building this airplane ? @entity2 : there are several challenges			1
one challenge is to have this airplane light enough despite its huge wingspan			0
the construction has to be done with carbon fiber with completely new technologies			0
the structure of @entity12 ... is 10 times lighter than the normal glider			0
it 's a breakthrough in construction technologies			0
the second challenge is energy			2
it has to fly through the night with a battery that has been loaded the previous day			2
so it has to be extremely energy efficient			2
another challenge is that it 's difficult to ... control such a huge airplane that flies so slowly and is so light			0
@entity0 : do you intend to be one of the pilots ? @entity2 : i will be one of the pilots , and @entity245 will also be a pilot			1
@entity0 : what 's the greatest risk on the flight ? @entity2 : the greatest risk is bad weather			1
if we can not remain in sunny areas , we may have to land somewhere or ditch in the ocean			0
but we have very , very good weathermen , and i 'm confident that it will work			0
@entity0 : so you will not be flying above the cloud cover ? @entity2 : we will be flying above the cloud cover , but during the night we have to fly lower because the efficiency of the batteries on the market is not yet sufficient for us to stay at high altitudes			1
so during the day we climb to 27,000 feet and then during the night , we go down to 10,000 feet to save energy			2
when we have sunlight , we go up again			0
which means that in the morning we absolutely have to be clear of clouds , otherwise we can not go up again			0
@entity0 : why ca n't you go up through clouds ? @entity2 : because we will have almost empty batteries every morning ... so if we have clouds in morning , we can not load the batteries to go back up			1
... this will be the big weather challenge for the team			0
@entity0 : where will you land the plane ? @entity2 : we need an airport with a large runway			1
we do n't need a long runway			0
we 'll have one stop in the @entity282 ... we have not yet decided where it will be			0
we 'll have five legs , and each leg will be five days and five nights on average			0
so we 'll stop in @entity289 , @entity290 , the @entity282 mainland , @entity292 and one stop probably in the @entity294 and then back in @entity289			0
@entity0 : what 's your projected date for takeoff ? @entity2 : the schedule is like this : in 2010 , we fly day and night			1
in 2011 , we 'll make international flights , several days and nights			0
in 2012 , we 'll cross the @entity139 , and in 2012 or 2013 , we 'll go around the world			2
@entity0 : how much does this project cost and who 's paying for it ? @entity2 : the entire budget is 100 million @entity282 dollars , coming from private sponsors			1
@entity0 : do you have children ? @entity2 : yes i have three kids			1
@entity0 : and are they adventurous ? @entity2 : well , they fly with me with hang gliders , with balloons , paragliders , micro-lights			1
they like it very much			0
but i 'd say they 're a little too young to show really what they 're going to do , they 're 15 , 17 and 19			0
... @entity0 : are you hoping your children will take on adventures the way you have ? @entity2 : no , i hope they will take on the challenge of improving the quality of life , bringing a pioneering spirit and new ways to think about political issues , environmental issues , technological issues , charity issues			1
in the 20th century , the heroes were the ones who went to the @entity341 , the @entity342 , @entity343 , the bottom of the ocean , space and the moon			0
in the 21st century i think the heroes will be the people who will improve the quality of life , fight poverty and introduce more sustainability .			0

@entity2 is a ballooning record - *setter* ; wants to fly around the world in a solar plane
he says he wants to demonstrate the potential of renewable energy to replace fossil fuel
@entity2 says in a @entity75 that thinking creatively requires the ability to *jettison* familiar ideas
he says , " we have to get rid of certainties , habits , paradigms , common assumptions "
