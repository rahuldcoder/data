-- there are several definitions of where the @entity3 begins and ends , but using the @entity5 is certainly the most encompassing , so we 've been holding our breath until we crossed this line			1
the crew has negotiated some stunning and treacherous waters to sail the @entity3			1
the @entity5 ( 66 30n ) marks the lowest latitude at which the midnight sun is ever seen			0
we 've had some stormy weather along the @entity15 coast			0
we had waves up to 8m high and winds over 40 knots			1
@entity19 was being tossed around a lot , and i was thrown clear across the cabin on one occasion , suffering a minor concussion that kept me in my bunk for several days			1
now that we 're out of the @entity26 and into the open sea , we are seeing more icebergs , instead of ice floes			2
ice floes are frozen seawater while icebergs are chunks of ice broken off glaciers in the @entity36			1
bergs begin as snow falling on land , which is then compressed into ice			1
even though the icebergs we see are easily 20 or 30 meters high , most of their volume is below water			1
only about one third of their entire volume is visible above water			0
this means you have to stay well clear of them because they may spread out under water , like an upside down mushroom			0
we 've also started thinking about what we 've experienced and learned this summer			0
by far the most impressive feature of the @entity36 has been its people			2
in every town we visited we met complete strangers who offered us help , welcomed us into their homes and provided us with hot showers and food			2
so many people showed genuine interest in our journey and generously told us about their lives , and we left nearly every town with a few fish or other wild game in our fridge			0
our mission when we left @entity71 , @entity72 in june was to find out how climate change is impacting @entity36 communities			1
we saw and heard about the impacts , from slumping land due to the melting of permafrost to hunter stories about the northward migration of species and the challenge that early ice break up poses for transportation			2
but more importantly , i 'm leaving the @entity36 with a sense that its communities are at a crossroads			1
they underwent a rapid change in the 1950s and 60s when people moved off the land and into settlements			2
now , those settlements are bracing themselves for unprecedented change due to resource exploration , economic development , political wrangling and an influx of new wealth , people and social forces			0
they 're all tied to climate change in one way or another , and they leave @entity36 community leaders with a big job ahead of them			1
climate change is turning the spotlight on the @entity36 , and hopefully that will mean federal government help where it is needed to aid the @entity116 in making wise choices for their future			1
i 've been struck by how although the @entity36 is very different place than the urban habitat most of us occupy , it is not in a different time			2
to maintain a romantic notion of the @entity36 as a place time has forgotten where life is simple and basic would be an insult to the people that call it home and be a mistake			2
many of the challenges brought to the @entity36 by climate change and economic development are the same as those faced around the world			1
it 's just a little colder , and a little more remote			0
while we 've begun mulling over our experiences this summer , it 's too soon for the crew of @entity19 to relax			1
we are still about three weeks from our final port			0
and the sailing is getting cold and tiring			0
the nights are very dark at sea , and temperatures are hovering just above zero degrees @entity150			0
on many days we are sailing in snow , rain and sleet			0
our onboard heater has broken down , so we have to wear extra layers in our sleeping bags to keep warm			0
this also means that the condensation builds up in the boat and it gets pretty damp , making it hard to dry our socks and gloves			0
but @entity163 is in sight , and we can get some comfort from our accomplishment of completing the @entity3 .			1

crew of @entity19 complete the @entity3 , heading for @entity163
crew have faced *dangerous* ice bergs and waves up to 8 meters high
@entity36 communities at a crossroads , directly and *indirectly* from climate change
