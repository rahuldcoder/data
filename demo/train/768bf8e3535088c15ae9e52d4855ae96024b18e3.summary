... i do n't know why the girl had me say those things , " he told @entity12 's @entity11 in an exclusive interview set to air on monday			1
" you 're saying you were set up ? " @entity11 asked			2
" well yes , i was baited , " @entity0 said			1
" i mean , that 's not the way i talk			2
i do n't talk about people for one thing , ever			0
i talk about ideas and other things			0
i do n't talk about people			0
" @entity0 , an 80 - year - old married lawyer and billionaire real - estate investor , has n't spoken publicly about the accusations since celebrity gossip website @entity26 posted a 10 - minute audio recording of him that drew widespread condemnation from fans , players and the league			2
in that audio clip , @entity0 chastised friend @entity35 for posting pictures online of her posing with african - americans , including basketball hall of famer @entity39			2

' i thought she liked me ' last week , another audio recording surfaced online , allegedly showing @entity0 trying to add context to the racist comments that got him banned from the league			1
in that recording , @entity0 purportedly explained that his comments were driven by jealousy			2
" the girl is black			0

" @entity35 told @entity98 earlier this month that the recorded conversation was similar to many she 's had with @entity0 about race			1
" there 's been a number of occasions where mr. @entity0 and i had conversations just like this one , " she said			1
" part of what the world heard was only 15 minutes			0
there 's a number of other hours that the world does n't know			0
" @entity0 told @entity12 he 's not sure who released the recording			1

an 80 - year - old man is kind of foolish , and i 'm kind of foolish			0

" i guess being 51 years older than her , i was deluding myself			0
... i just wish i could ask her why , and if she was just setting me up			0
" @entity0 says he 's spoken with @entity39 referring to @entity39 , @entity0 purportedly said on the recording : " admire him , bring him here , feed him , f * * k him , but do n't put ( @entity122 ) on an @entity123 for the world to have to see so they have to call me			1
and do n't bring him to my games			0
" as criticism over the recording spread , @entity39 was among the first to say that @entity0 should be forced to sell the team			1
" he should n't own a team any more			0
and he should stand up and say , ' i do n't want to own a team any more , ' " @entity39 said in an @entity98 pregame show interview last month			0
@entity0 told @entity12 he 's spoken twice with @entity39			1
" did you apologize to him ? " @entity11 asked			2
" if i said anything wrong , i 'm sorry , " @entity0 said			2
" he 's a good person			0
i mean , what am i going to say ? has he done everything he can do to help minorities ? i do n't think so			0
but i 'll say it , he 's great			2
but i do n't think he 's a good example for the children of @entity142			0
" will owners force sale ? the matter of the team 's sale is with the @entity3 's @entity148 , which met wednesday in a conference call			1
members discussed the " termination of mr. @entity0 's ownership of the team , " the @entity3 said in a news release			1
the committee will meet again next week , the statement said			0
@entity3 's strategy to force a sale hinges on 1981 document if the case proceeds to a full vote , 75 % of the owners would have to approve the forced sale			1

" she wants to remain a passive owner , " said attorney @entity168			0
" she 's not going to want to manage the team			2

" she only wants to own the team in her lifetime			0
she 's 79 years old			0
at this point , she 's earned it			0
she 's been an owner for 33 years , and she 's an avid fan			0
" in an interview with @entity98 on sunday , @entity174 said she was prepared to fight any attempt by the @entity3 to take away her stake in the team			2
" i will fight that decision , " she told @entity98 's @entity179			0
" to be honest with you , i 'm wondering if a wife of one of the owners , and there 's 30 owners , did something like that , said those racial slurs , would they oust the husband ? or would they leave the husband in ? " @entity3 spokesman @entity193 said in a statement after the @entity98 interview aired that what happens if the owners vote for a forced sale is already spelled out in the @entity199			1
" under the @entity199 , if a controlling owner 's interest is terminated by a 3/4 vote , all other team owners ' interests are automatically terminated as well			1
it does n't matter whether the owners are related as is the case here , " he said			0
" these are the rules to which all @entity3 owners agreed to as a condition of owning their team			1
" sterling vs. the @entity3 : who has the edge ? @entity0 purportedly says jealousy behind racist comments			1

the @entity3 says all owners ' interests in the team could be terminated
@entity0 tells @entity11 , " i was baited . ... that 's not the way i talk "
" i 'm not a racist . i made a terrible , terrible mistake , " he says
" if the owners feel i have another chance , then they 'll give it to me , " he says
