it may seem ironic that one of the most sustainable city infrastructure projects underway in the @entity3 is taking shape in a metropolitan region known best for its traffic congestion and expansive urban sprawl			1
or perhaps it should be expected here , where , consciously or not , we are beginning to reconcile the physical structure of highways and arterial roads on which we have prospered for the last 60 years with a dramatically changing marketplace that has rendered that structure newly less desirable			0
in either case , it is remarkable that in a region many view as the poster - child for urban sprawl , we also find the @entity20 , a uniquely innovative , sustainable and ambitious idea that has begun to address not only the physical challenges of sprawl , but also to change @entity20 's cultural expectations for itself and for its future			1
and for regions of the world as culturally different as @entity30 and @entity31 , where one can find evidence of the same early steps toward urban sprawl that @entity3 took six decades ago , @entity20 's grasp for more sustainable strategies should serve as fair warning			1
read more about the @entity20 scheme in college , i spent a year abroad in @entity38 and almost every day i would walk under an abandoned railroad viaduct on my way to the grocery store or laudromat			1
when i returned a few years later , the viaduct had been transformed			0
at street level its large brick vaults were filled with arts - related studios and businesses , reinvented as the @entity49			0
and along the railroad up top there was the @entity52 , a linear garden walk with a third - story vantage point that changes the way you see @entity38 and how people might think about obsolete urban infrastructure and public space			2
later in graduate school , i envisioned a much larger transformation for my own hometown			2
the @entity20 began its current reincarnation as my thesis project on public transit , economic development and community revitalization			1
the proposal repurposes a loop of mostly abandoned railroad tracks encircling downtown into a sustainable new transportation corridor and a signature public meeting ground comprised of a linear park with an electric tramway and multi-use trails			2
it reinvigorates 45 diverse neighborhoods along the way , organizes adjacent abandoned industrial land for transit - oriented development , expands transit service within the urban core , and connects various parts of an emerging regional trail system			1
but while this physical transformation of underutilized infrastructure is a relevant precedent for other cities -- the @entity52 is itself a prototype for the much larger , @entity20 - scaled @entity91 that encircles the historic heart of @entity38 -- that may not be its most compelling story			1
in a world that faces daunting challenges for sustainable urban development and increasingly polarized politics , perhaps a more important lesson is the project 's role as a catalyst for cultural change			1
starting in 2001 and over the next three years , with infectious optimism and a lot of hard work , the citizens of @entity20 bought into a compelling grassroots vision for the @entity20 and made it their own , creating a powerful informal alliance between neighborhood groups , developers and nonprofit organizations who found themselves in the unlikely position of advocating for the same set of ideas			2
hear the story at @entity20 this broad support then empowered the city 's political and business leadership to endorse the project and sparked an expansion of the project 's vision , including over 1,000 acres of new parks , the largest affordable - housing initiative in the city 's history and perhaps the longest and most unique arboretum in the country			1
with every expansion of its vision , the physical project reinforces changing cultural preferences about the built environment , demonstrating local sustainable growth strategies that can be applied to other parts of the region , and over time , make comprehensive changes more politically palatable			0
in this way , the @entity20 not only profoundly changes the physical city , it changes the way we think about @entity20 -- what is possible , and what our cultural expectations are for the places that we live			0
this kind of change is critical to the region 's economic success -- to any region struggling to reinvent itself so that it can thrive in the global marketplace			0
because while these new perspectives contrast sharply with previous generations who built our sprawling roadway network , they mirror national shifts in preferences about the built environment driven largely by a general disenchantment with car - dependent lifestyles and an increasing desire for cultural authenticity in the places that we live and work			0
successful cities have always been places where people want to be , and once again technology and changing generational preferences are redefining that kind of place , this time leading us back toward social environments with mixed - use districts , strong cultural resources , greater mobility and a more robust public realm			2
communities that recognize and take advantage of these changes first will be best positioned to succeed in a more competitive future			0
so whether they look to district - scaled projects like the @entity193 in @entity194 or @entity196 's @entity195 , or to city scaled projects like the @entity91 or @entity199 's @entity201 , or to complex regional proposals like those for the @entity204 , cities can find innovative , non-partisan public works projects that not only begin the physical transformation required to attract future residents and jobs , but also catalyze a cultural shift in thinking about what kinds of policies and infrastructure we should be investing in			0
this cultural shift will mean far more for global sustainability than any physical project ever could .			0

@entity20 bringing abandoned rail road and adjacent land back to life with walkways and parks
@entity20 first envisioned regenerating land in graduate thesis in 1999
from @entity30 to @entity31 , cities are moving towards urban sprawl , says @entity20
project can be a " catalyst for a change " in a world facing sustainable - development challenges
