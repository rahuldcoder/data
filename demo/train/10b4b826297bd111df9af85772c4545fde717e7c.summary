-- the last time you flew , did you wonder what 's really going on behind that closed cockpit door ? who 's actually flying the plane ? is it a human being , or capt. @entity9 ? based on its record , @entity10 leads the commercial airline industry in safety			1
and for most passengers , that information alone provides all the confidence in the world			1
but there will always be nervous fliers who need to know : who are they trusting with their lives , human or machine ? " there are millions of people out there who are under the impression that the airplane is flying itself and the pilots are only there in case something goes wrong , " says @entity25 , a 22 - year veteran commercial pilot who blogs about airline issues			1
this , says @entity25 , is the big lie			0
it 's true that airline computers and electronic control systems allow pilots to fly " hands off " beginning soon after takeoff , continuing through the flight route and -- in very rare cases -- all the way through touchdown			1
but @entity25 says that does n't mean the planes fly themselves			1
one day , @entity25 was flying as a passenger when that false impression really hit him square in the face			0
the airliner glided to a particularly smooth landing , and a " smart @entity55 " seated a few rows behind @entity25 shouted , " @entity54 job , autopilot ! " " everybody around us started cackling , " @entity25 said			1
" while it was funny , it was wrong			0
and i knew that he meant it			0
" even capt. @entity63 enjoyed the backup of computer autopilot during his famous " miracle on the @entity68 " emergency landing three years ago			1
@entity63 was in the pilot 's seat when his @entity71 collided with a flock of geese and lost thrust 2,700 feet over @entity74			1
computer - assisted flight systems were active , @entity63 said , but there was no need for them			1
" we never got to the extremes where [ flight control computers ] would have protected us " from pointing the plane 's nose too high , or going too fast or too slow , he told @entity0 last week			1
" we did n't need any of it			1
" in fact , flight control computers actually hindered the landing , said @entity63 , who 's now a @entity89 aviation and safety consultant			1
flight software prevented him from keeping the plane 's nose a little higher during the last four seconds before he ditched @entity93 in the icy @entity68			1
" so we hit harder than we would have , had we been able to keep the nose up , " he said			0
" that was a little - known part of the software that no airline operators or pilots knew about			1
" of course , most passengers never experience that kind of emergency			1
during a normal flight , there 's no way to know when your pilots are using computer - programmed automatic flight systems			1
@entity25 described what goes on behind the cockpit 's closed door			0
hands - on flying has n't disappeared , he said -- it 's just different			1
for example , setting up and executing an automatic descent has changed			0
" in the old days , you had your hand on the wheel and you pushed the nose down and adjusted the power accordingly , " he said			0
" now , you 've got to hold a different set of buttons and dials and switches , but in the end , you 're still doing the same thing -- you 're still flying the plane			0
" " none of it is easy , " he said			0
" in a lot of ways , it 's more difficult because airplanes are so much more complex now			0
" sure , there 's a lot of " hands - off " time , but there are also many tasks that surround the management of the airplane and its computerized systems			2
" you 're utilizing a different skill set			0
" some fear that airliner pilots rely too much on autopilot technology , saying that such a reliance leads to lack of practice and infrequent use of manual piloting skills			2
experts have suggested this may have been a factor in the mysterious @entity154 crash of @entity155 from @entity156 to @entity157 , which killed 228 passengers and crew			2
as technology becomes more and more sophisticated -- and trusted -- an expert at the @entity162 says commercial airliners could one day be piloted by remote control			1
" we fly many unmanned air vehicles around the world today , mainly for military or small airplane applications , " said @entity165 , a professor of aeronautics and astronautics , and head of the @entity169 , at @entity162			2
" at a technical level , there 's no reason why we could n't do that with a commercial airplane			2
" far - fetched ? @entity165 is n't the only one in the airline community talking about this			1
at an aeronautical conference last august , @entity180 , a @entity181 president and ceo , announced that a " pilotless airliner is going to come ; it 's just a question of when			0
you 'll see it in freighters first , over water probably , landing very close to the shore , " according to @entity190			2
the idea wo n't be widely accepted until at least a couple of generations from now , said @entity165 , who 's also a licensed private pilot			1
but experts are already planning how it might work			0
there are two basic academic models			0
in one , pilots would fly airliners by remote control from " cockpits " on the ground -- just as pilots currently fly predator military drones over @entity205 and along the @entity10 - @entity207 border			1
" there 's another model where you might have a flight attendant sufficiently trained , " said @entity165 , to act as a backup pilot on automated or remote - controlled airliners			1
yes , you read that right			0
there 's an idea out there to have backup pilots who also serve passengers peanuts and tomato juice			2
" there are people who discuss that , " @entity165 said			0
" i do n't know if that 's particularly realistic			2
" frustration is the word @entity25 uses to describe this kind of talk from " aerospace academics , researchers , professors , consultants and other smart people who often have a very limited grasp of the day - to - day operational realities of commercial flying			2
" that 's not to sound arrogant , @entity25 said , " but it 's a theoretical discussion for researchers and scientists , and it 's not anything with any practical application at this point			0
" " it 's wrong on so many levels that it 's hard to get my arms around it and explain , " he said with exasperation			0
" and for what ? you 'd still need human beings to operate these planes remotely			1
thus , i 'm not sure what the benefit of this would be in terms of cost			0
" cost might actually be an argument against it			0
building necessary infrastructure would cost hundreds of billions of dollars , @entity25 said			0
it 's like saying we should get rid of surgeons in the operating room because of advances in medical technology , he said			0
" i think there 's something about flying that brings out this remote - control fantasy in people , " said @entity25			1
" i do n't exactly know where it comes from			2
" as @entity162 's @entity165 explained it , pilotless airliners would simply be the end result of the current evolution of flight deck staffing			2
here 's what he means : improved technology has contributed to shrinking cockpit staff			0
according to @entity165 , before the @entity181 757 began service in the 1980s , most large airliners had a standard flight deck staff of three			2
they were the pilot , co-pilot and a flight engineer who managed pressurization , heating , fuel and pneumatic systems			2
then , @entity165 said , " those systems became automated , and the standard flight deck crew went from three to two			0
" going from two to one pilot would be a difficult threshold for the airline community to cross			1
two onboard pilots allow for a safety net -- a redundancy , he said -- to ensure sound judgment calls and to protect against possible incapacitation of the pilot -- for example in case of sickness or an accident			2
but going from two to zero is another thing altogether			0
" it 's not clear that anybody would want to ride on an airplane that does n't have a crew on board , " @entity165 said			2
would @entity165 ? no. " not at this point , " he said			0
no matter how trustworthy the technology becomes , @entity165 said remote - controlled airliners will never become reality without widespread public acceptance			1
but he does n't rule out that possibility			2
" you have to remember , nobody thinks twice about getting onto an automated train , for example , at the airport			0
" this is n't all conjecture , though			2
to be sure , unmanned aircraft are coming soon to airspace near you			0
in fact , it may not be long before you see remote - controlled drones flying over your neighborhood			1
the @entity335 plans to begin flight testing and writing rules aimed at integrating unmanned aircraft into the national airspace system as soon as 2015			0
some of these might include flying drones with sophisticated cameras like the @entity343 , which can be used for police search and rescue , or unmanned crop - dusters			0
by 2018 , the nation 's unmanned aircraft could number more than 15,500 , according to industry projections			0
aerospace contractor @entity350 is developing an unmanned combat jet the size of a fighter plane			0
if successful , the @entity354 would claim two firsts for an unmanned jet : in - flight fueling capability , and launch and landing aboard @entity361 aircraft carriers			1
for @entity63 -- perhaps the nation 's most famous pilot -- the idea of remote - controlled airliners triggers a lot of critical questions			1
he speculated about what might have happened to @entity93 after it collided with the geese if the plane had been controlled by a remote pilot			1
" what if the geese damaged whatever forward viewing devices there were -- such as cameras or infrared or radar ? what if the damage prevented the operator from seeing the river ? or seeing the plane 's height above the river ? " how would the operator be able to land the plane safely ? " on every airplane i 've ever flown , i tend to use the technology to its full capabilities when it 's appropriate , " @entity63 said			1
" but looking as far into the future as i can see , every airplane -- no matter how sophisticated -- really needs to be flown , and flown very well , by a human pilot			1
