the judicial punishment follows a six - month sporting ban given to @entity1 , who plays for @entity17 @entity16 side @entity15 , following the august incident when he assaulted @entity20 midfielder @entity19			1
" this is an extremely severe sentence compared to the criminal record of my client , " @entity1 's lawyer @entity21 told @entity0 affiliate @entity22 after the three - judge panel 's ruling , which also included a $ 25,000 fine			1
" it 's all the more severe because of the motivation that was raised by the president of the @entity32 to justify the sentence , " added @entity21			0

@entity19 's lawyer @entity47 said " the court wanted to mark the occasion , " as @entity16 players were considered role models to many people			1
