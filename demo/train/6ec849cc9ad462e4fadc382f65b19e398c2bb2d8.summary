@entity0 got to hold her newborn son for 53 days			0
" and then the next day , " she said , " he was gone			0
" @entity2 was one of five babies known to have died within 11 months of undergoing heart surgery at @entity5 in @entity6 -- surgeries that , nationally , babies usually survive			1
" he was born , and he looked as healthy as any of my other children , " said @entity9 , whose son @entity10 was the first to die			0
and then three weeks later , i was burying him			0
" shortly after the fifth death in 2012 , @entity14 children 's decided to stop its heart surgeries and placed its only pediatric heart surgeon on leave			1
at the time , the babies ' parents said , they did n't receive any explanation			1
and today , they 're still waiting for answers			2
" something happened , " @entity23 said			0
" ca n't nobody give me no answers			1
" but now , pediatric heart surgeries are resuming at @entity5 -- without any reported investigation by the state health department and without oversight by anyone			1
there seems to be no medical governing body that needs to sign off on the decision to reopen the heart surgery unit			1
" the only person i need permission from is me , " said dr. @entity36 , executive vice president for health affairs at the @entity14 's health care system , which includes @entity5			1
10 ways to get your child the best heart surgeon last year , @entity36 said , he put the pediatric heart surgery program on hold because the mortality rates were n't what he wanted them to be			1
" they were ok , and ok is n't good enough for me , " he said at the time			2
" it 's got to be better			2
it 's got to be good			2
" @entity36 commissioned an internal report ( @entity53 ) on the heart surgery program			1
parents of the dead babies hoped that might provide them with some information			1
but the 102 - page report does n't explain why the babies died			1
in fact , it does n't acknowledge any deaths at all			2
" how do you know when the problems have been fixed when they 're not identified ? " asked @entity63 , whose daughter @entity64 died in january 2012			1
" i mean , they could say they fixed them			0
but is an internal review really objective ? " asked in may whether parents should trust that @entity14 children 's would fix any issues before reopening the program , @entity36 threw his hands in the air			1
" this is @entity78 , " he said			0
" you know , they have a choice			0
they can trust us or not trust us			0
all i can tell them is , i 'm not going to reopen until i feel good about it			0
it 's as simple as that			2
" a hospital spokesman declined a request for another interview with @entity36 , referring questions to a news release about the internal report			2
@entity95 reached @entity36 this month as he arrived to speak at a community center and asked whether he could give parents some answers about why their children died			1
" unfortunately , babies die at children 's hospitals after having heart surgery at other places also , " he said			1
" we explained to you that our mortality ( rate ) fit the national standards			0
" @entity14 children 's , however , has been reticent to release statistics on the program , unlike other hospitals that are more transparent			1
after a legal battle -- which saw the @entity116 attorney general requesting data and the university appealing to a state circuit court -- the hospital released the following number : patients at @entity5 were dying after all heart surgeries at the alarming rate of 7.1 %			1
that 's more than double the national average of 3.2 %			2
@entity36 wo n't say how well it performed specific heart surgeries on children , information that some hospitals put on their websites			1
" we as parents deserve this information , " said @entity133 , @entity64 's mother			1
" i expect nothing more from a health care facility than honest answers			2
and whether it 's good or bad , we should know			2
i mean , that 's not too much to ask			0
" parents react to story on @entity14 heart surgeries @entity146 , whose son @entity147 died , says it 's " scary " that the hospital is going to be taking pediatric heart patients again			1
" it really hurts that they 're going to open this program back up , " @entity23 said			0
" i 'm very scared for the kids			0
i do n't want nobody else to go through this again			0
" @entity9 said she 's worried about " the same thing that happened to my baby			0
... i never brought my child home			0
he never left the hospital			0
" however , @entity14 children 's says it 's doing things differently			1
the surgeon placed on leave has since left , so a new heart surgeon will be hired			0
the hospital also will dedicate an intensive care unit specifically for heart surgery patients and is considering forming a partnership with another hospital for pediatric heart surgeries			1
in addition , the hospital says , it will no longer perform the most difficult types of heart surgeries			1
but that does n't satisfy the parents still mourning their children			2
" sometimes , you feel like you 're alone through it , " @entity146 said			0
" i do n't think that it gets any easier , ever , " @entity9 said			0
" i 've been told my entire life that time heals everything			0
i do n't believe that			0
i still miss my baby			0

@entity5 halted its heart surgeries in 2012
the hospital is resuming its pediatric heart surgery program
parents of five babies who died still do n't have answers
