seventy years ago , thousands of @entity1 troops stormed the beaches of @entity3 to take on the might of the @entity6 army			1
the soldiers all carried guns and grenades , but private @entity10 of the @entity11 was armed with something else as well : a camera			1
in the days , weeks and months that followed the d - day landings in northern @entity16 , @entity10 , who was born in @entity18 , took more than 8,000 photographs with his trusty 35mm @entity21			1
the pictures -- many of them raw , graphic , disturbing -- follow his advance , and that of his unit , the @entity27 , from the beaches to @entity29			1
they represent one of the most complete collections of images of @entity34 , as seen through the eyes of someone who fought during the conflict			1
now a spritely 92 - year - old , the former @entity38 is back in @entity3 to mark the 70th anniversary of the d - day landings with an exhibition			1
@entity10 's show , " @entity44 " is on display at the @entity46 , a stone 's throw from @entity49 where the infantryman came ashore 70 years ago			1
" the first thing i see is this gun , looking at me , " he told @entity51 on a tour of the exhibition , gesturing at a black - and - white photo of the intimidating weaponry that confronted him as he stepped onto @entity16 soil			0
@entity10 's status as a regular soldier who happened to be carrying a camera -- rather than an official war photographer -- meant he had to make do with whatever equipment he could find			1
after begging and borrowing rolls of film , he would process his pictures by night , improvising by pouring chemicals into two army helmets to develop and fix the images			2
but it also meant he could get closer to the action , and to the people involved : the result is a series of photos which are often more candid than the official pictures of war			2
" i was with the same unit , i knew everyone intimately , " he says			0
" the intimacy was at such a level that if i aimed a camera , they did n't react to it			2
" @entity10 documented the devastation left in @entity3 in the wake of @entity88 and across @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity6 after years of warfare : villages and towns ravaged by the conflict , corpses lining the roads			1
he also captured some of the joys of liberation : a shot of a @entity38 embracing a young @entity16 girl as others dance in the background is among his best - known images			1
in a short film made to accompany the exhibition , @entity10 explains that his dual role as soldier and photographer meant he faced a constant choice between his gun and his camera			1
" i considered the situation and i said ' first the rifle , then photographs ' -- i was careful to make sure i would take photographs when i felt safe			0
if i did n't feel safe i did n't take the picture			0
" and he says that the speed at which he was forced to work also had an impact on the final images			0
" sometimes i was scared because i felt that while i was taking photographs perhaps the @entity121 would kill me , would shoot me , so what i did was to work very quickly			0
many times i did n't even look through the viewfinder , i just shot			2
" after the war , @entity10 became a professional portrait and fashion photographer , working for magazines including " life " and " look , " taking pictures of stars including @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135			1
decades on , @entity10 says he is disturbed at our failure to learn the lessons of the past and ensure that conflicts like the one he fought in -- and photographed -- are consigned to history			2
" i think that the world , the way it 's going , it has n't changed at all			0
you 'd think we would learn a lesson with @entity34 but we are arming like hell , " he says			2
" one of the greatest thing we should have , we do n't have			0
a @entity152 , we do n't have it			0
you 'd be surprised the need that we have to have that			0
" he has returned to @entity3 many times in the decades since d - day , and he 's determined that this 70th anniversary visit wo n't be his last			2
" i 'm going to do this at 102 , " he insists , saying he 'll be back in 2024			0
" my doctor says : ' i do n't know how you do it			0
' " read more : ' it 's too early to forget , ' insists @entity167 : the myths and reality of d - day			0
