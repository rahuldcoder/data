in our @entity3 series , @entity1 correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events			0
after a one - on - one interview with president @entity10 on wednesday , @entity1 en @entity12 's @entity11 is traveling with @entity10 to @entity13 and to the @entity14 in @entity15			1
president @entity10 and @entity17 president @entity16 in @entity13 on thursday			1
@entity13 , @entity13 ( @entity1 ) -- it 's the return of an @entity20 president to @entity13			2
although @entity22 visited the country several times , he never made it to this city of more than 20 million people , and it is president @entity10 's first visit to @entity20			1
@entity10 's relationship with @entity13 started on shaky ground , although the first foreign leader he met with as president - elect was @entity17 president @entity16			1
reports from the @entity34 and the @entity35 considered that @entity13 was at risk of becoming a failed state , something that did n't sit well with the @entity16 government			0
@entity40 corrected course and even admitted its own responsibility in @entity13 's growing drug war , which killed 6,000 last year alone			0
statements by @entity46 members and @entity10 himself calmed things down , but tensions arose again			0
@entity50 ended a pilot program that allowed @entity17 trucks into @entity54 territory , as contemplated in the @entity55 ; @entity13 , in line with the treaty , retaliated by imposing fees on 90 @entity54 products			2
even so , the bilateral relationship is at a high point and large - scale protests are n't expected when @entity10 visits the @entity17 capital			1
but there are pending issues , such as immigration reform , trade and a pressing question in this capital : who will the next @entity54 ambassador be ? local media have been reporting that @entity72 , a @entity73 - @entity20 expert on @entity74 and a former @entity54 ambassador to @entity76 , is @entity10 's choice , but the fact that he wrote a report for the @entity80 on @entity81 and the importance of reconstructing a failed state was n't well received in political and government circles			1
@entity10 and @entity16 have a lot to sort out in this one - day visit			0
then comes the @entity14 in @entity15 , where @entity10 will face 33 heads of state , including @entity89 president @entity88 , who called @entity10 ignorant on @entity91 - @entity20 issues , and other leaders who want @entity93 , a member of the @entity95 suspended since 1962 , to be reinstated			0
although @entity10 lifted some restrictions on travel and remittances to the island by @entity73 , many in the region want more , including the lifting of the decades - old embargo , something @entity10 says he is not considering			0
it is not clear if @entity10 will be welcomed in the same way he was by @entity74 two weeks ago , but so far the signs are positive -- to have a @entity54 president saying he is willing to listen to and treat @entity20 neighbors as equals is something the region is n't used to .			2
