-- the @entity1 and its allies have plenty to worry about in @entity4 and @entity5 , with @entity6 , two @entity7 , the @entity8 and a plethora of other militant groups active			1
but the @entity1 and intelligence analysts believe another group , one of @entity5 's most powerful and well - established , is also broadening its horizons			0
it is @entity16 , which means " @entity16			0
" it was blamed for the attack on @entity21 , @entity22 , hotels in november 2008 in which nearly 200 people were killed over three days			1
that attack " shows the organization 's global ambitions , " said @entity23 , the @entity24 's coordinator for counterterrorism			2
@entity28 has been in @entity29 meeting @entity5 officials this week as part of a " strategic dialogue " between the @entity1 and @entity5			0
@entity16 " appears to have a very complex mix of indigenous and international targets , " @entity23 said at a @entity1 @entity34 briefing thursday			1
" we are working with @entity5 's civilian authorities to investigate further into this organization , but definitely [ @entity16 ] maintains some level of connections with @entity6 , " @entity23 said at the briefing [ when added above ]			0
earlier this year , @entity23 said of the @entity21 attacks : " the target was set directly out of [ @entity45 ] @entity45 's book , filling the gap created by a diminished @entity6			2
" @entity16 claims it is focused on the same issue as it was when created : freeing the disputed territory of @entity50 from @entity22 rule , experts say			1
in a rare interview earlier this year , the man widely regarded as the organization lader , @entity54 , told the independent newspaper that the group was not involved in the @entity21 attacks , despite substantial evidence to the contrary			2
@entity16 was allegedly behind several high - profile attacks in @entity22			1
and it is precisely because it is aimed at @entity22 's presence in @entity50 that the organization has been tolerated and even supported by @entity5 officials over the years -- even after it was banned there in 2002 , intelligence officials and some @entity5 officials say			1
the current @entity5 ambassador to @entity65 , @entity66 , wrote three years ago that @entity16 was " backed by @entity68 money and protected by @entity5 intelligence services			0
" @entity54 has been periodically put under house arrest when things have got a little overheated , but the group maintains an expansive compound near @entity74 in @entity75 and according to intelligence analysts remains well - connected to elements of @entity5 's @entity78 or @entity78			0
@entity79 in @entity4 believes @entity16 is extensively involved with militant groups there			1
friday , the @entity81 said it had detained a @entity7 commander in the eastern @entity84 province who had " assisted with the recent influx of [ @entity16 ] insurgents into the province			2
" they are believed to have worked with the @entity8 to carry out attacks on @entity22 targets in @entity92 , including several this year			2
much to @entity5 's consternation , @entity22 has expanded its presence in @entity4 , especially through @entity22 government - aided construction and training projects , since the overthrow of the @entity7			1
@entity16 fighters are also believed to have joined the @entity7 in attacks on @entity101 in eastern @entity4 over the last couple of years			1
one scholar who has long studied @entity16 believes it is well placed to expand its activities			0
" evidence suggests @entity16 has support cells in the @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , mainland @entity113 , and possibly @entity114 , " wrote @entity105 this year in a paper for the @entity107			0
the case of @entity116 suggests that is the case			0
the @entity5 - born @entity1 citizen confessed this year to a planning role in the @entity21 attacks and a conspiracy with senior figures in @entity16 to attack the office in @entity125 of the @entity127 newspaper that published cartoons of the @entity129 in 2005			1
he said he visited @entity5 several times to meet with @entity16 leaders .			0
