-- the two major parties in @entity2 each claimed victory in the nation 's historic parliamentary elections as officials worked through the night to count the ballots			1
the ruling @entity8 and the @entity9 both said it would win a majority of seats in the new 150 - member body			0
billionaire businessman @entity14 , who leads the underdog " @entity9 " alliance , claimed exit polls showed his alliance would win 100 seats			0

an official from the @entity34 said that 61 % of eligible voters took part in the election			2
both sides poured large amounts of money into the election			2
the government 's @entity41 has been professional and independent , however , said @entity43 , president of the @entity43 , a @entity45 congressionally funded democracy support organization			1
" there 's no question in my mind ... the election commission can be relied upon			0
" " but the question is will everyone stay calm when the results come out , " @entity51 , who is in the @entity2 capital of @entity53 , added			1
observers : @entity2 opposition may be premature in declaring victory the result will affect the structure of political power in the southwest @entity64 nation , and the role of the presidency -- almost nine years after the @entity67 brought @entity20 to power			1
the new parliament will be elected as the country prepares to usher in constitutional changes that will go into effect once @entity20 's term ends in 2013			1
the new system , according to @entity75 , an expert on @entity2 and senior associate at the @entity77 in @entity78 , will shift power from the president to a prime minister			1
" the prime minister will be chosen by parliament , which thus hands important powers to whichever political force obtains a majority in parliament in the october 1 elections , " @entity81 said			0
" @entity89 will be the main body running @entity2 , so it will be a much more diluted power , " @entity20 said			1
" there will no longer be a strong man or stakeholder of power and i think that is a fair system because in democracy there are checks and balances for different people			0
" until recently , @entity20 and the @entity8 have controlled much of political life in this country of 4.5 million people and has been praised by @entity45 and @entity107 officials for making progress in the fight against corruption and continuing economic reform			1
the evidence can be seen in gleaming new skyscrapers			0
but critics , who have coalesced into the " @entity9 " alliance led by @entity14 , say reform is only skin - deep , charging that @entity20 is pulling all the levers of @entity120 - style " administrative measures			1
" they have raised concerns about a level playing field for the opposition during this election , alleging harassment and limitations on their access to the media			0
high stakes in polarized election for his part , @entity20 refers to the opposition leader @entity14 as that " big money guy			1
" the president accuses @entity14 of wanting to " buy the whole system , " and sees the hand of @entity137 behind him , with which @entity2 fought a brief but bitter war four years ago			1
the president said he is concerned with the amount of wealth that @entity14 made in @entity137 , and that that money is being used to influence the elections			1
" we know what @entity137 money is all about , " he said			0
" how it was made , what kind of methods were used , and certainly it is a source of concern , " he said			0
those charges are false stereotypes , @entity14 told @entity0 in a phone interview from the @entity2 capital , @entity53			2
a self - made businessman who made his money in @entity137 after the fall of the @entity120 , @entity14 left @entity137 shortly after @entity157 came to power			0
his staff confirms his status as @entity2 's richest man , with a fortune estimated at approximately $ 6.4 billion , equal to almost half of @entity2 's economic output			2
" it 's not money and wealth which is my capital , " he said			0
" it 's trust from the people toward me			0
money has nothing to do with this			0
" the billionaire said he has sold all his @entity137 assets , and defended his reputation			0
but the president insisted that not only the opposition leader but @entity157 himself is trying to undermine @entity2			1
" @entity157 said clearly that he is interested in the @entity2 election outcome			1
he clearly said that he wanted the @entity2 government out			2
he clearly said that he wanted me to be physically destroyed , he said it publicly , " @entity20 said			2
@entity2 's electoral waters have been roiled by a shocking video that emerged last month showing abuse in a @entity2 prison , including one male prisoner being sexually assaulted			2
the opposition claims the video is proof of a repressive system put in place by @entity20 and his government			2
former @entity2 prison guard : i witnessed abuse for years @entity20 said his government acted quickly and decisively to the video , citing an investigation that has led to arrests			1
" not only were the immediate perpetrators arrested , " he said , " but two government ministers resigned because they shared political responsibility for allowing the system to fail			0
" read more : @entity2 interior minister quits over prisoner abuse videos the torture shown on the video is no accident , but part of a system that is in shame , @entity14 said			2
@entity211 said the video is significant , as the prison population quadrupled over the last eight or nine years			0
" i do think it ( the video ) supports the opposition narrative that the government is arrogant and unaccountable , and this is obviously a war of two narratives over @entity2 that we 're seeing in this election , " he said			1
@entity14 complained that opposition supporters have been arrested , beaten and had property seized , but nevertheless , " we still hope we will be able to achieve something close to a democratic election ... we hope that the process will be carried out at least close to the democratic fashion			0
" still , incidents of violence are possible , he said			0
read more : country profile : @entity2 @entity2 experts , too , point to the nation 's political volatility because it is so polarized			1
if such polarization is institutionalized through a vote , it can be healthy , but when it 's not it can create a dangerous and unpredictable environment , said @entity235 , associate director of the institute for @entity107 , @entity137 and @entity237 at @entity239 's @entity238			2
" we 've seen the clash of the titans , " said @entity81			0
" we 've seen the clash of two very big figures in @entity2 politics , @entity20 and @entity14 , who do not want to share power			1
they both are claiming total victory , and this , obviously , will have some impact in the @entity45 , because both sides will be looking to the @entity45 and calling on the @entity45 to be arbiter , which is rather an unrealistic thing to happen , but i think @entity78 's going to have to brace itself for those calls			2
