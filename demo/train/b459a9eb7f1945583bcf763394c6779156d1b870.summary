-- it 's cocoa season across the southern half of the @entity3			1
the pods are ripe for picking , some turning from green to yellow , like bananas			0
except these trees are unlike anything i 've seen before ; a quirk of evolution , they would look at home in @entity16 ' narnia or @entity18 's middle - earth : their precious cargo grows not from the branches , but straight out of the tree trunk			2
it 's october , a critical time of year for the poorest rural communities who sell cocoa beans -- and for chocolate lovers too , since this small equatorial country in @entity29 produces more than one third of the world 's cocoa			1
across the @entity3 , cocoa is grown on family plantations , each typically only a few hectares			1
the small parcels of land are handed down through the generations , each son struggling to make ends meet , just like his father before him			0
@entity42 inherited two hectares of land when his father died seven years ago			0
he was just 11 years old at the time			0
still only 18 , he has acquired the appearance of a man resigned to a hard life , looking like he barely has two beans to rub together			0
but beans are the one thing he does have -- a sack full of them , tied precariously to the back of his rusty bicycle			0
with global demand for cocoa easily outstripping supply , @entity42 's beans are increasingly valuable to the big - name chocolate companies , but taking into account inflation , their monetary value has fallen in recent decades			1
" it 's tough , " @entity42 tells us			2
" i am brave , but i need help too , " he says , admitting that he struggles to make ends meet			0
@entity42 is right at the bottom of a multi-layered global supply chain which sees cocoa transformed from bean to bar , and as such , the fundamental cocoa - nomics are firmly against him			1
traders , processors , exporters and manufacturers all demand their margin , and for everyone to make a profit , the system dictates that @entity42 -- who has little or no bargaining power -- receives the bare minimum for his bag of beans			0
in a country where cocoa directly supports about 3.5 million people , the annual gdp per capita is not much above $ 1,000			1

it 's low tech , hazardous and labor - intensive			2
and unfortunately , in this part of the world , many little hands make work that is not light			2
the issue of child labor has blighted the chocolate industry for decades ; and despite coming to global attention over the past 10 years , it 's a problem that wo n't go away			1
systemic and deeply ingrained in the culture , its roots are found in the grinding poverty afflicting rural communities : farmers who ca n't afford to pay adult workers use children instead			2
the tiny village of @entity113 has put on a big welcome for chocolate 's " royalty " : a team from @entity118 , the world 's largest food company , is paying a visit to one of the 23 schools funded by the company 's sustainability program			1
stopping child labor and increasing access to education is seen as the best long - term approach to bring prosperity to these villages			1
@entity131 , @entity118 's head of global operations , says the firm aims to " improv [ e ] the living standards of those communities that produce cocoa and in doing so , we will create a sustainable source of supply for an industry that is growing and will continue to grow			1
" @entity90 industry critics have long argued that companies like @entity118 have failed in their responsibility to improve the lives of the farmers who grow their cocoa			1
@entity148 of the @entity149 suggests that companies are at last grappling with the issues -- even if driven by self - interest			0
" when you hear a company talks about sustainability , what they 're actually talking about is the sustainability of them being able to continue to buy cocoa in the future , " he says			0
but he admits that some progress has been made			0
" the impression i have is that the current steps being taken are actually more significant than what we have seen in the past "			0
@entity167 owns a seven - hectare plantation in the town of @entity170			0
he is also president of his local farming co-operative , which produces about 1,200 tonnes of cocoa beans a year			2
@entity167 paints a worrying picture for the future of the chocolate industry : the price of cocoa fixed by the government is too low ; the trees are old and diseased ; co-operatives like his ca n't get finance to invest for the future			1
" we put in too much effort for how much we 're compensated , " he tells @entity0			2
" so little by little , if rubber is better paid we 'll drop cocoa because [ we ] cocoa farmers work for nothing			1
" he knows farmers who are turning their backs on cocoa altogether : where cocoa trees once stood , rubber plantations are now springing up -- they are more lucrative and productive all year round			1
and as in many @entity29 nations , rural communities are moving away from their roots , seeking a better life by joining the mass influx to the capital @entity203			2
ultimately a famer 's beans are bought by traders or middlemen working for the industrial processors and exporters			0
@entity211 food giant @entity210 buys 20 % of all cocoa beans grown in the @entity3 , exporting them raw or grinding them into cocoa liquor , butter or powder -- products which are then sold on to manufacturers to make chocolate			1
it is at this stage of the process where the cocoa bean gets its added value , but of course by now the farmers have already dropped out of the chain , so they do n't get a share			1
in villages like @entity231 , the stark poverty on display is a bleak reminder of the disassociation between the chocolate bar we consume and the farmers who grow cocoa			1
two hundred locals gathered to tell us about their lives , so dependent on the revenue of cocoa			0
nobody from a chocolate company had ever come here			0
and perhaps most extraordinary of all , not one villager had ever tasted chocolate			0
most did n't even know what it was , until we showed them			0
a village elder was chosen to take a bite of a @entity251 ( one of the most popular chocolate bars in the world ; its manufacturer @entity118 says 150 are eaten every second )			2
his face contorted at the sweetness -- and perhaps at the realisation that this is what his life 's toil is all about			0

@entity0 's @entity271 returned to @entity29 's cocoa plantations to look for progress in fight against child labor
@entity3 produces more than one third of all the world 's cocoa , but many farmers live in poverty
the cocoa industry supports about 3.5 million people in the @entity29 nation
growers ' position at the bottom of the cocoa value chain means they see just a tiny proportion of the cost of a chocolate bar
