if you read the headlines out of @entity2 this past @entity3 weekend -- more than 40 shot , including nine killed -- you might be surprised to learn that the city 's homicide rate is still trending downward , according to the police chief			1
yes , that 's right : police superintendent @entity9 told @entity11 this week that @entity2 's homicide rate is " still ahead of where we were last year , which was a record			1
" the number of homicides in @entity2 last year dropped to 415 , compared to 503 in 2012 , an 18 % drop			0
that lower level has n't been seen since 1965			0
" a week does n't wipe out two years of progress , " @entity9 told @entity11 's @entity19 in an interview monday			1
" we always knew that we 're going to have good days and we 're going to have bad days , we 've just got to make sure we 're having more good days than bad			0
" but does a lower murder rate really matter in @entity2 , where such rampant gun violence has earned the city the nickname " @entity2 " ? " people always say , ' i do n't feel much better , even though shootings might be down by 40 % , ' " @entity9 told @entity27			1
" well , the reason for that is kind of simple			0
if you have 10 shootings in your neighborhood last year , and you have six shootings in your neighborhood this year , do you feel 40 % better ? absolutely not			0
" there are some @entity2 neighborhoods -- poorer , less educated , predominantly @entity39 and infested with gangs -- that have murder rates 10 times higher than other @entity2 areas			0
@entity9 says the news coverage of shooting incidents like the ones that took place last weekend does n't paint a complete picture of the police response			1
" we are getting out in front of a lot of shootings , " the police chief told @entity27			2
" it 's hard to see success sometimes when you have a spate of shootings			0
" @entity2 's gun violence typically heats up as the temperature rises , so the police department has banked some overtime to deploy more officers to the city 's trouble spots			1
in the meantime , @entity9 is using the unwanted attention around the bloody @entity3 weekend to push legislators to pass gun control laws that he says will help police turn things around in @entity2			1
" it 's just insanity that there 's such a proliferation of firearms that they 're so easy to get your hands on , " @entity9 told @entity11 on monday			2
" the studies show when there 's more restrictive gun laws , there 's less gun violence			2
it 's not brain surgery , it 's really really simple			0
" it 's going to take us a while to fix poverty and the break - up of the family units and education and jobs			0
but we can do something about gun laws today and we 're just not doing it			2
" that may be an uphill climb : in february , a federal judge struck down @entity2 's ban on gun sales , saying it went " too far in outright banning legal buyers and legal dealers from engaging in lawful acquisitions			2
" and in 2010 , the @entity106 declared @entity2 's 28 - year - old handgun ban unconstitutional			0
making it even more difficult , last year , @entity108 became the 50th state to allow its residents to carry concealed weapons after a veto from its governor failed to kill the legislation			0
@entity9 may get some limited help from the feds at least in keeping repeat criminals off the street : the office of newly appointed @entity122 attorney @entity121 announced monday the creation of a violent crimes section to focus on how to more effectively use federal statues to prosecute those behind @entity2 's gun violence , the @entity115 reported			1
shortly after @entity127 took over as @entity2 's mayor in early 2011 , he brought in @entity9 , who had previously led the police force in @entity130 , @entity131			1
a year into @entity9 's term , he was hailed as a hero			0
then , the city 's homicide rate skyrocketed at end of 2012 and there were calls for @entity9 's resignation			1
as the murder rate started to drop , those calls abated -- but @entity2 's police and city leaders , particularly @entity127 , still face a lot of criticism for not doing enough			1
opinion : it 's not @entity127 's fault that @entity2 is divided @entity9 , a regular on @entity27 's original series " @entity149 , " has admitted that the city " has one of the worst , most difficult , most intractable gang violence problems in the country			1
" and he 's made it clear that his top priority is " dealing with gangs , guns and the press			0
" " the media , they keep talking about the rising toll of gun violence in @entity2 while the numbers are going in the other direction , " @entity9 said last year .			2

more than 40 people were shot over @entity3 weekend in @entity2
nevertheless , the city 's homicide rate is trending downward , police chief says
" a week does n't wipe out two years of progress , " says @entity172 . @entity9
@entity9 is pushing for stricter gun laws
