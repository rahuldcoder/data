-- @entity1 's 12 years a slave is an agonizingly magnificent movie : the first great big - screen dramatization of slavery			1
based on actual events , it begins in 1841 and tells the story of a free black man from @entity10 , @entity11 , a musician named @entity13 ( @entity14 ) , who walks around in a natty gray suit , secure in the courtly modesty of his life as a husband and father of two			1
but then he accepts an offer to go to @entity23 , with a pair of traveling entertainers , and when they 're out at a restaurant drinking wine , we get the queasy feeling this is too good to be true			1
@entity13 is n't being hired for his talents			2
he wakes up in a cold , stark prison cell , with a spiderweb of chains shackling his arms and legs			2
the traffickers have drugged him and are sending him down to @entity39 , where he 'll be sold into slavery			1
gazing at his chains as if he were in a bad dream he simply has to wake up from , the brilliant @entity14 places us right inside @entity13 's skin , and instantly we 're sharing the horror this man 's life has become			1
@entity14 may have the most eloquent eyes of any actor now working			2
they are orbs of pure expression , and in this movie they need to be because @entity13 can rarely speak what he 's feeling			1
what we read in his intensely private thousand - yard stare is the agony of a man robbed of freedom , but also the renunciation of despair			1
whatever happens , he will persevere and survive			2
he will know misery , but he will not fall into the trap of madness			2
the scalding power of @entity1 's artistry begins with this : he uses the fact that @entity13 was n't born into human bondage to draw us into the experience of slavery			1
@entity13 has to learn to answer insults or bear whippings with silence , to pretend he 's a toady who ca n't read or write , and the cruelty of that process becomes the film 's way of dramatizing the unnaturalness of slavery			1
is it just @entity13 who 's really a free man ? no , every slave is			1
12 years a slave is based on a book @entity89 wrote about his ordeal , and @entity1 , working from a superb script by @entity93 , has structured the film as a diarylike series of incidents			1
there are no trumped - up arcs to pad out what we 're watching			0
the crushing reality of @entity13 's day - to - day existence is all the drama the film needs			2
@entity13 's first slave owner ( @entity105 ) reveals a few humane instincts — as much as a slave owner 's behavior can be called '' humane			0
'' but then , after showing too much pride , @entity13 gets sold off to @entity110 ( @entity111 ) , a seething plantation owner who 's a kind of diabolical psychologist of sadism			0
he can see the fire in @entity13 's heart and is driven to break him			0
when he learns that @entity13 has tried to get a white laborer to send a letter north , he holds @entity13 's face close , saying he knows what 's going on , and @entity13 defuses the situation with an ingenious lie that he must sustain for minutes on end , without a tremor , staring his overseer right in his taunting eye			0
this is virtuoso filmmaking that lays bare the degraded relationships with a terrifying intimacy			1
@entity110 has a consuming obsession with @entity132 ( @entity133 ) , the slave who picks more cotton each day than any other slave ( 500 pounds of it ) and whom he regularly rapes			0
their '' relationship '' becomes part of a debased triangle , since @entity110 's wife ( @entity142 ) is aware of his fixation			0
due to her jealousy , and to @entity110 's disgust at his own desires , @entity132 is subjected to the torments of hell			0
@entity133 's performance is shattering			0
she goes to a place of private terror and communion beyond pain			0
when @entity110 is whipping @entity132 , @entity1 plays a startling trick : he holds on the image of @entity110 brandishing the whip — a @entity158 cliché — and then , as we 're lulled into that familiar '' it 's only a movie '' mode , the camera , without a cut , spins around to show the obscene violence of the whipping			1
the mortification of flesh hits us in the solar plexus			0
it 's @entity14 's extraordinary performance that holds 12 years a slave together			0
he gives @entity13 a deep inner strength , yet he never softens the nightmare of his existence			0
his ultimate pain is n't the beatings or the humiliation			0
it 's being ripped from his family , blockaded away from all he is			0
12 years a slave lets us stare at the primal sin of @entity184 with open eyes , and at moments it 's hard to watch , yet it 's a film of such emotion that in telling the story of a life that gets taken away , it lets us touch what life is			1
