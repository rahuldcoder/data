-- it 's bizarre to think that 2 guns and @entity3 are competitors in any regard , but the pics happened to open in theaters on the same weekend			1
while the r - rated , buddy thriller and the @entity11 - rated cg and live action sequel about some mystical blue creatures probably are n't drawing the same audience , in the wold of box office returns , only the winner matters			1
and it turns out that more people turned out for the male - dominated violent comedy than for another kid - friendly sequel			1
2 guns ( @entity21 : b + ) opened at first place , earning an estimated $ 27.4 million for the weekend			1
this is a squarely solid opening for stars @entity24 and @entity26			0
according to exit polls , males , who comprised about 51 percent of the audience , gave the movie an @entity21			1
for director @entity31 ( @entity32 ) , this opening is a career high			0
the charisma and chemistry of two stars seems key to the appeal , especially for a movie with such an ambiguous and generic " action " title			2
playing in 3,025 locations and averaging about $ 9,025 per screen , 2 guns exceeded @entity45 's expectations for the weekend , which had put the movie in the $ 20 million range			1
co-financed by @entity48 and @entity49 with an estimated production budget of about $ 61 million , the big question is : how the movie will fare in weeks to come ? it remains to be seen whether or not the solid reviews and word - of - mouth buzz can help make it significant hit			1
the @entity58 fell about 59.1 % from its opening weekend to bring in about $ 21.7 million during this frame			1
playing on 3,924 screens , @entity62 's $ 120 million @entity61 pic now boasts a domestic total of $ 95 million			0
overseas , the well - reviewed @entity66 - starrer has made an estimated $ 160.2 million , bringing its worldwide total to $ 255.2 million			2
the third place spot went to @entity70 2 ( @entity21 : @entity71 - ) , which made about $ 18.2 million over the three - day weekend , bringing its domestic total up to $ 27.8 million			1
as we mentioned about yesterday , the domestic returns do n't really matter around this sequel , as it 's all about how the movie ( made for $ 105 million ) performs internationally			2
playing in 43 overseas markets , @entity70 2 made about $ 52.5 million overseas			0
worldwide , it has taken $ 80.3 million			0
though it will be pitted against the other animated offerings of the season , @entity3 is really only competing with the success of its 2011 predecessor , which made $ 536.7 million worldwide ( $ 421.1 million of which was overseas )			1
the @entity88 blew past the $ 100 million mark , adding a $ 13.7 million weekend			2
unlike most of the movies on the slate , @entity90 actually added theaters to its count , helping to account for a modest 38.5 percent drop from the previous weekend			2
after three weeks in theaters , director @entity97 's horror film has made about $ 108.6 million and looks poised to continue its streak in the weeks to come , especially considering it 'll exist without direct competition until you 're @entity102 opens on august 23			0
@entity103 came in fifth place this weekend with about $ 10.4 million			1
after five weeks in theaters , the animated juggernaut is the second - highest - performing movie of the year , behind only @entity107			1
so far , the sequel has also brought in about $ 387 million internationally , with a global total of $ 713.7 million			0
here 's an at - a - glance view of the top 5 : 1			2
2 guns -- $ 27.4 million 2			0
the @entity58 -- $ 21.7 million 3			1
the @entity70 2 -- $ 18.2 million 4			0
the @entity88 -- $ 13.7 million 5			0
@entity103 -- $ 10.4 million the @entity113 also opened this weekend in four theaters ( in @entity115 and @entity116 ) to about $ 200,000 , with a $ 50,000 location average			1
the lauded high school - set , coming - of - age drama starring @entity120 and @entity121 has garnered significant buzz since opening at the @entity123 in february and could be another gigantic hit for new film distributor @entity125 ( @entity126 , @entity127 )			2
next weekend should be exciting in the box office race : we 're the @entity130 and @entity131 : @entity132 both open on wednesday , while @entity133 and @entity134 hit theaters on friday			0
it will be interesting to see how a comedy , a sci - fi dystopia pic , and another animated feature will factor into the game , and whether or not they 'll all be able to secure top spots in the rankings			0
