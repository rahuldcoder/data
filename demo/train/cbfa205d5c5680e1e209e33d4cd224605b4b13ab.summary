? " - @entity0 , @entity6 , @entity7 the customer is king			1
the customer is always right			1
these are phrases that have been with us for a while			1
as business and marketing environments have become tougher , it 's true that those companies that have found out what the king wants -- and provided it -- have been successful			2
this would make it easy , if only it was clear which king to ask			2
many companies draw a distinction between " consumers , " those who are the end - user of a product or service , and " customers , " those who are the trade , distributors and so on			2
this kind of customer is very powerful indeed -- especially if they are @entity37 or @entity38			2
so which customer is more king than the other ? and what if they do n't agree on what they want ? sounds like war			2
in global companies the complexity rises			2
they have consumers and customers , but it 's also common that employees of that company are also customers of other employees			0
a trend at the moment is that regional employees are customers for central employees			0
motivation and , more importantly , aligned goals , are absolutely critical to success			1
getting this wrong can be costly in many ways -- not least in morale , time and money			0
the real truth is that this is not a question of " or			0
" customer and employee satisfaction and motivation are critical			1
the challenge is to create a virtuous circle			0
motivated employees are a great way of delivering what the customer wants , be that service , fast moving consumer goods , innovation , or anything else , and happy customers make employees feel rewarded			0
of course , the virtuous circle has to start somewhere			0
in creative industries such as ours , often the job is to stretch further than the customer can see			0
they can tell you what they like today , but tomorrow looks misty and murky			0
a motivated group of creative individuals love nothing more than the art of invention , the creation of the new , the alchemy of an idea			1
if you want a king , it 's the idea , not the customer or the employee			1
being competitive comes from having better ideas than your competition : an idea about targeting a particular group of people , an idea about a new product , an idea about how or where to distribute it , or an idea about how to advertise it			1
in 1944 @entity112 , an employee of @entity113 , defined an idea as " nothing more or less than a new combination of old elements			1
" it 's a definition that we continue to find very useful today			0
your customers are an excellent source of the familiar ; a highly motivated employee will most likely be the one who combines the familiar in a new way , creating the idea , and the competitive edge			1
on my way to work this morning with a trainload of people in glorious @entity132 isolation , i wondered what kind of company @entity133 would be today if the employees had been thinking the customer was king instead of working out how to combine some music with a little bit of one of their computers .			0
