-- according to @entity2 , managing director of the @entity3 , it is payback time for @entity5			1
despite being forced to " clarify " her comments after a furious reaction from thousands of @entity5 on @entity10 , there will , she emphasized , be no softening of the demands the stricken country will have to meet if it is to receive further aid			1
but what if @entity5 simply ca n't manage payback ? as prescribed by the @entity3 itself , the normal remedy for a country that ca n't pay its debts would be devaluation and default			1
locked in the eurozone , these options are not available			2
no one denies that the @entity5 have very largely brought this disaster on their own heads			2
but , as anyone who has been there recently knows , they are now paying an excruciatingly heavy price for their past misdeeds			0
the public sector has seen its pay cut by an average of 40 % over the last year , and most pensions have been reduced			0
in what is left of the private sector things are even worse , especially for those who have lost their jobs in the downturn and the young , 50 % of whom are now unemployed			0
for them , when work can be found , the going rate is often half what it was before the crisis			0
yet petrol , food and clothes all cost more than they do in @entity51			0
amazingly for @entity5 , even taxes are getting harder to evade			2
the property tax on many homes has trebled			0
because it is levied via electricity bills , the only way to avoid it is to go without power			0
as the economy continues to shrink under the impact of austerity at home and recession abroad , it is little wonder that anxiety about the outcome of next month 's poll extends far beyond @entity5 itself			1
we read a lot about the thuggish extreme - right party , @entity71			0
but it is the rise of the left - wing @entity74 grouping and its charismatic young leader , @entity75 , that has really got the markets and the @entity79 establishment rattled			1
to them , @entity75 is dangerous because he has pledged to tear up his country 's controversial bailout pact with @entity83 , despite saying he wants the country to stay within the euro			1
but he stands almost alone among leading @entity87 politicians in his ability to spell out two basic truths			0
firstly , if the @entity79 really wants to push @entity5 out of the euro , it should have prepared the way months , if not years ago , rather than leaving it to the last minute			1
secondly , the sacrifices being demanded of @entity75 's countrymen are financially and politically impossible			1
there is no longer any point in pretending otherwise			0
last week , @entity87 's assembled leaders once again told the @entity5 that they should view the elections on june 17 as a referendum on whether or not they are going to stay in the euro			1
the not - very - subtle threat is that if they back @entity75 , they will be out on their ear			2
but , as the man himself frequently points out , if the new election is really to be treated as a referendum , the question wo n't just be whether @entity5 should stay in the euro			1
with the single currency in its present fragile state , it could very easily become whether the eurozone itself survives			2
is this really something the rest of @entity87 wants @entity5 to decide ? and even if the @entity5 vote the way @entity87 tells them to , what will have been achieved ? everybody knows that the fundamentals wo n't have changed			2
the likelihood is that there will only be another crisis -- probably even bigger -- six months down the road			0
seen in this light , @entity75 's demand that the @entity79 should instead help them to find a realistic way to stay in the single currency suddenly begins to make sense			1
after leading in the opinion polls at the start of the campaign , the latest surveys have @entity74 slipping behind the right wing @entity135 for what looks set to be another tight finish			1
the pressure from abroad may be beginning to have an effect			0
but given the mess both @entity5 and the euro are in , the threat that @entity143 could yet call the eurozone 's bluff wo n't go away			1
that genie is now well and truly out of the bottle , whoever wins next month			0

the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity157 .			2

@entity157 says anxiety about next month 's poll results extends beyond @entity5
the rise of the left wing @entity74 grouping and its leader @entity75 has rattled the markets
but @entity157 says @entity75 has been alone in spelling out the truth on the euro
@entity157 : if the election is treated as a referendum it could define whether the eurozone survives
