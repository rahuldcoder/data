-- the past month has been a time of frenzied activity for @entity3 and the @entity4			1
they taped two tv appearances , played special gigs at the @entity8 and @entity9 , and launched a world tour in support of @entity3 's new lp , " @entity13			1
" late last week , @entity0 chatted separately with @entity4 guitarists @entity14 and @entity16 about the new @entity4 and how they 're carrying on after the loss of @entity18			1
@entity0 : you guys almost always do rehearsal shows before launching a big tour			1
why did n't those happen this time ? @entity16 : previously , the rehearsal shows were kind of a last - minute thing			1
i think probably what happened is that we were putting our own show together , which inevitably heads towards rehearsal shows			1
but because of the new record , we made commitments			1
we did the @entity33 , two nights on " @entity35 " and the @entity36			2
next on the horizon was the @entity9 show			1
all of a sudden it was like , " gosh , we have five different shows to prepare			2
" @entity3 always takes the time to slant the shows to the occasion , and we had to get our own show up and we just ran out of time			1
@entity14 : it was interesting to witness our own extremes with the @entity36 and the @entity9 show			1
we went from emphasizing soul music at the @entity8 to flipping 180 degrees for a @entity51 celebration at @entity9			2
it was quite interesting to have that reinforced and have it be totally integrated in the work -- not doing either extreme as a sort of specialty , gimmicky show , but actually having those roots so firmly planted in the material -- and to be reminded how wide and varied the identity of @entity3 and the @entity4 actually is at this point			1
it 's some kind of example of @entity64 in all of its forms			2
@entity0 : it was a pretty bold move to debut the new band and new show at the @entity8 , considering it was being broadcast live			1
@entity14 : to do our first show as a broadcast , that 's real balls			1
i 'm proud of us for pulling it off			2
it was pretty close to flawless , i have to say			2
keep in mind , we have a brand new five - piece horn section			2
we 're still working on horn parts			2
we 're still working on vocal parts with the singers			2
we have a couple new people involved			2
i took it for granted , but they were probably a bit nervous			2
they did great , though			2
we spent a lot of time thinking about this show and talking about it			1
the horn section was a good answer to the unanswerable : " how do you replace @entity18 ? " well , you do n't			1
the same way you replace @entity99			2
you have somebody else playing those parts , but you have to do something else , you have to morph it into a hybrid of what you were			2
it 's not going to be the same			2
@entity0 : how long ago did rehearsals begin ? @entity16 : they 've been off and on , but we got together in the second week of january			1
we had to address what was in front of us , which was a lot , and kind of take our time and experiment and let things evolve			2
there 's so many changes			2
certainly the biggest change of all is @entity18 , which is a terrible loss			1
i 've been in the band for 28 years , and i 'm pretty sure it 's accurate to say that the band has never gone on the road with three - and - a - half albums of new material			0
when @entity3 put out the " @entity126 " package , there were 23 unreleased songs and they never toured behind that			0
and then you had 11 new songs			0
all this material is really valid and great and we 've never integrated it into our show , which is already hundreds of songs that we have n't presented in over two years			1
it was an abnormal amount of new material to disseminate			0
it 's just a giant , beautiful jigsaw puzzle of music			0
@entity14 : usually we start rehearsals two weeks before the first show and kick around some ideas for the set , maybe do six rehearsals , period			1
each tour has its own energy , and the writing is the script for the show			1
it 's like a @entity154 show or a movie			1
you have to start with the script , and that 's always a new album for us			1
we 've never been a nostalgia band			0
every single time we go out , we 're saying something new , something that 's been on @entity3 's mind in that period			0
in this case , instead of our usual five or six days , we did 10 or 12			0
we probably had 40 horn charts			0
that 's a lot of work just to outline the charts , never mind tweak them and really get into the details of arranging , which , of course , i love to do , and @entity3 is also really good at			0
so that 's going on , and we have to integrate this new album , adapt it -- in this case , a little more adaptation , because it was a solo album			0
this is the first time this has ever happened , where he 's touring with the @entity4 behind a solo album			1
but it 's good , and we had the whole new album down in two days			0
then you start kicking around ideas and doing older things			0
" @entity190 " ended up playing a major role in this show , really for the first time			1
it 's always been an emotional song but sort of a specialty song , maybe an encore			0
this time it ended up playing a very , very different and central role			0
this is the most difficult task ever			0
how do you address @entity18 and @entity99 ? how do you address that ? you talk to ten different people and they 're going to have ten different ideas			1
but it 's really not easy			0
you 're trying to do something that 's very , very emotional , and at the same time , you do n't want to make the show a funeral			1
you want to make sure the show is a celebration of life			1
it 's a very delicate , very fine line to walk			0
and ( @entity3 ) comes up with this rap -- it 's so f * * * * * * great , and so perfect			0
this guy still inspires me after 45 f * * * * * * years of doing this			0
i 'm like , " @entity216 , that 's so f * * * * * * good , so important			0
" it 's such an important moment in the show ... it 's probably the best start of a tour , i think ever , honestly			1
@entity0 : i 'm sure it was hard the first time you walked onstage without @entity18			1
@entity16 : the first time that hit me the hardest was the @entity33			1
i 'm standing there , and there 's nobody to my right			0
that 's someone i 'll miss the rest of my life , but i still love playing and it does n't take away from the power of the songs of the band			1
@entity14 : it 's emotional for me to walk onstage without @entity18 , and it always will be			1
i still honestly once in a while get that feeling with @entity99			0
i look over there and say , " oh yeah , @entity99 's no longer ... " that 's never going to change			0
so i think the more people onstage , the more that helps			0
the more the configuration is different , the more that eases your emotional pain			0
in other words , you 're not trying to replace them , you 're doing a different thing			0
through the years , since we started playing in 1965 , you do a lot of different things			0
i 've been in horn bands			0
i 've been in country bands			0
you go into 100 different configurations in your life			1
now it feels like another one			0
it 's almost like you 're in a different band , in a sense , even though the core of the band is still there			0
