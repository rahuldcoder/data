@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity3 arrived in @entity1 on sunday for a three - day trip centered on an international nuclear security summit in @entity0			1
he flew into @entity0 , where he is expected to hold a bilateral meeting with his @entity1 counterpart @entity7			2
top officials from 54 countries , including @entity10 and @entity11 , will attend the summit meeting on monday and tuesday			0
but its message of international cooperation has been overshadowed by @entity17 's announcement last week that it is planning to carry out a rocket - powered satellite launch in april			2
@entity1 has said it considers the satellite launch an attempt to develop a nuclear - armed missile , while the @entity22 has warned the move would jeopardize a food - aid agreement reached with @entity25 in early march			1
president @entity7 has already said he will use the summit to drum up international support against the actions of his northern neighbor			2
@entity17 says it has a right to a peaceful space program and has invited international space experts and journalists to witness the launch			0
@entity17 's state - run @entity35 ( @entity35 ) cited a spokesman from the @entity37 as denouncing the @entity1 for working to turn the summit " into a platform for ( an ) international smear campaign " against the @entity17			1
the @entity17 has a right to a nuclear deterrent and to conduct a " satellite launch for peaceful purposes , " the committee 's statement said , and will take " counter-measures " if the @entity1 stirs up international criticism of its actions			1
against that tense backdrop , @entity3 is scheduled on sunday to visit for the first time the demilitarized zone that splits the @entity53 in two			1
he will also meet with some of the 28,500 @entity22 troops stationed in @entity1 , two of his top national security advisers said tuesday during a conference call			1
although @entity3 himself has not been to the demilitarized zone during his two previous trips to @entity1 as president , secretary of state @entity58 paid a visit to the area in 2010			1
and @entity3 's predecessor , @entity64 , used binoculars to peer into @entity17 from a sandbagged bunker on the southern side of the border in 2002			2
the date of @entity3 's visit " is virtually two years to the day " since the sinking of the @entity1 warship , the @entity69 , which left 46 @entity71 sailors dead , said @entity72 , director for @entity73 , @entity1 , and @entity17 at the @entity74			1
@entity1 says a @entity17 torpedo attack was to blame for the ship 's sinking			2
the @entity82 has denied the accusation			0
in a dramatic reminder of the @entity22 military presence in @entity1 , an @entity22 f - 16 fighter jet crashed wednesday near @entity88 airbase on the western coast of @entity1			1
the jet 's pilot safely ejected before the crash , and no casualties were reported , said maj. @entity94 , public affairs officer of the 7th @entity95			0
@entity0 's nuclear summit will be the second after @entity3 hosted the first meeting in @entity99 in 2010			1
he initiated the biennial summit after presenting his vision of a nuclear - free world in @entity103 in april 2009			2
the official agenda will deal with nuclear terrorism and how to secure the world 's nuclear material			0
although @entity17 is not on the agenda , it is likely to be discussed on the sidelines			0
@entity25 announced this month it would carry out a " satellite launch " in mid-april to commemorate the centenary of the birth of @entity112 , the country 's founder			0
using ballistic missile technology , however , is in violation of @entity117 and against a deal struck with the @entity22 earlier this month that it would not carry out nuclear or missile tests in return for food aid			0
@entity25 has said it will see any critical statement of its nuclear program as " a declaration of war			0
" concerns about @entity127 's nuclear program , again not on the official agenda , will also be discussed in bilateral meetings between leaders			0
@entity2 's @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 contributed to this report .			0

the @entity1 is running a " smear campaign " against its neighbor - @entity17 state media
@entity1 is preparing to host a high - *profile* nuclear security summit
@entity22 president @entity3 will be among more than 50 heads of state at the meeting
he will visit the demilitarized zone between @entity1 and @entity17 for the first time sunday
