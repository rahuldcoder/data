@entity0 -- a little - known provision of the @entity3 might provide a little - used way for president @entity5 to unilaterally get around stalled efforts to prevent the country from defaulting on its debts			1
it is a legal audible that was considered two years ago in a similar crisis , and ultimately rejected by @entity5 , a former constitutional scholar			1
in remarks on thursday , the president said the stakes were stark , if the debt ceiling were not raised , and the government unable to pay its bills			1
" as reckless as a government shutdown is , an economic shutdown that results from default would be dramatically worse , " he said , pointing the finger at @entity19			2
congressional republicans who control the @entity26 insist they will not act until the administration commits to delaying implementation of key parts of the healthcare reform law , or to further spending cuts -- ultimatums the @entity26 rejects			2
the game of political chicken raises the potential of a recession and market meltdown if the @entity37 is not replenished by mid-month			0
some economists warn the debt ceiling impasse is a far greater threat than the ongoing government shutdown			1
that 's where @entity43 of the 14th @entity44 comes in : " the validity of the public debt of the @entity48 , authorized by law ... shall not be questioned			2
" does that mean the president could on own his raise the debt ceiling ? some congressional allies say yes			1
" it is an option that should seriously be considered , " said @entity55 chairman @entity54 of @entity56			0
@entity26 minority leader @entity59 of @entity60 said it should have been done in 2011 , the last time the two branches went through this			2
back then it was former president @entity65 who led the rhetorical charge			1
he said he would have raised the debt ceiling " without hesitation " and " force the courts to stop me			1
" then - treasury secretary @entity71 also suggested such a legal right was possible , and plausible			2
but @entity5 was not sure			1
" i have talked to my lawyers , " he said at the time			0
" they are not persuaded that that is a winning argument , " suggesting he believed the courts would not accept such a move -- and more importantly , would the nation 's creditors			2
his spokesman monday repeated the @entity26 line @entity82 had the responsibility here			0
" the president ca n't raise it by himself , " said @entity26 spokesman @entity84			1
" this administration does not believe that the 14th @entity44 gives the power to ignore the debt ceiling			1
and even if the president could ignore the debt ceiling , the fact that there is significant controversy around the president 's authority to act unilaterally means that it would not be a credible alternative to @entity82 raising the debt ceiling , and would not be taken seriously by the global economy and markets			1
" legal and political scholars -- and the federal courts -- have debated just how relevant , and how far @entity43 was designed to go			1
the amendment was ratified in 1868 , to ensure in part , the unified nation 's debts from the just - ended @entity106 would be honored , and that @entity110 claims would not			0
the unquoted part of the provision specifically mentions the public debt " incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion			1
" the @entity48 @entity120 in 1935 -- in @entity121 v. @entity48 -- suggested @entity43 could be applied in other circumstances			0
" while this provision was undoubtedly inspired by the desire to put beyond question the obligations of the government during the @entity106 , its language indicates broader connotation , " said chief justice @entity123 in the opinion , which concluded that voiding a @entity48 government debt was beyond the power of @entity82			1
indeed other better - known parts of the 14th amendment -- the " due process , " " equal protection , " and " privileges or immunities " citizenship clauses -- have been cited in a sweeping range of litigation beyond its original reconstruction response to the rights of former slaves			0
those cases include abortion , segregation , even the 2000 @entity149 presidential ballot dispute			0
despite mr. @entity65 's bold challenge daring the courts to intervene , any unilateral action on the debt ceiling would be sure to prompt immediate lawsuits			1
whether an " aggrieved party " such as a taxpayer or bondholder , could establish legal " standing " -- allowing any legal action to proceed -- would be the first legal hurdle , a process that could drag on for months , even years before the @entity120 would be asked to offer the final word			2
but some politicians have said a default on the nation 's debt would constitute the kind of national emergency requiring of bold presidential action , something that would be politically acceptable to the public			2
legal challenges , they say , would wither if the economy rebounds			0
@entity5 urged negotiations to continue , but on thursday said the 2011 debt crisis hurt average @entity48 , and could do so again			1
" our economy took a bad hit			0
our country 's credit rating was downgraded for the first time , just like you would be downgraded if you did n't pay your mortgage			2
this time , they are threatening to actually force the @entity48 to default on its obligations for the very first time in history			0
" but some @entity187 say a constitutional crisis is overblown and so is concern of what will happen if both sides fail to agree in coming days			0
" i do n't think the credit of the @entity48 is going to be collapsed , " said rep. @entity192 ( @entity193 ) on @entity1 thursday			0
" i think that all this talk about a default has been a lot of demagoguery , a lot of false demagoguery			0
we have plenty of money coming in to service the debt			0
when we stop servicing the debt , that would be default			0
we 're a long , long ways from that			0
" so the dilemma here for the @entity26 would appear more political , less legal			0
in invoking executive power to raise the debt ceiling , @entity5 might earn quick political points , by claiming to put the nation 's financial health above congressional inaction			1
but the risks to a market and credit backlash , global investor unease , and softening public support -- not to mention an eventual @entity120 showdown -- might urge continued @entity26 caution			0
after all , the debt ceiling has been raised at least 74 times in the past half century -- 10 times in the past decade -- always through the typical back - and - forth political sparring between the @entity26 and @entity19 .			1

little known legal provision could again provide opening for president @entity5 on debt ceiling
@entity5 said that the stakes were stark if the government could not pay its bills
former president @entity65 said *previously* he would act unilaterally and test the courts
but @entity5 had the chance in 2011 and was n't *convinced* it was the correct legal strategy
