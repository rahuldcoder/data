it 's time to go after @entity2 in @entity3 and @entity4 , president @entity0 said wednesday night in a nationally televised address intended to sell stepped - up military efforts to a war - weary public			1
announcing a broad campaign against the @entity11 jihadists who have rampaged from @entity4 across northern @entity3 , @entity0 announced an escalated @entity13 military role as part of a strategy that includes building an international coalition to support @entity3 ground forces and perhaps troops from other allies			1
@entity13 airstrikes have been hitting the jihadists in @entity3			2
those strikes will be expanded to @entity2 targets in @entity4 , @entity0 said			1
" i have made it clear that we will hunt down terrorists who threaten our country , wherever they are , " he said			0
" that means i will not hesitate to take action against @entity29 in @entity4 , as well as @entity3			2
this is a core principle of my presidency : if you threaten @entity13 , you will find no safe haven			2
" the declaration answered calls from a growing number of @entity13 politicians for such a step , with increasing public support			2
" this was a very difficult speech for him to give , " @entity41 chief political analyst @entity40 said of a president who campaigned on ending wars in @entity3 and @entity44			2
" he 's inserted us into the middle of a @entity4 civil war			2
" more @entity13 forces to @entity3 @entity0 also announced another 475 @entity13 military advisers would go to @entity3 , pushing the total figure to about 1,700			1
at the same time , he made clear the strategy differed from all - out war again in @entity3 less than three years after he withdrew combat forces from the country			0
" it will not involve @entity13 combat troops fighting on foreign soil , " @entity0 said			1
his address from the @entity63 also sought to convince allies and the nation of a firm @entity13 commitment to lead an international coalition to fight the jihadists who rampaged across northern @entity3 from @entity4 this year			2
they are known as @entity2 , @entity29 and @entity70			0
noting the formation of a new @entity3 government , which his administration has demanded , @entity0 announced that " @entity13 will lead a broad coalition to roll back this terrorist threat			1
" objective : " degrade and ultimately destroy " @entity2 " our objective is clear : we will degrade , and ultimately destroy , @entity29 through a comprehensive and sustained counterterrorism strategy , " he said			0
senior administration officials who briefed reporters before the speech on condition of not being identified said airstrikes against @entity2 targets in @entity4 would occur " at a time and place of our choosing			1
" " we 're not going to telegraph our punches by being specific about the time and nature of the targets , " one official said , adding that " we will do that as necessary as we develop targets			0
" also wednesday , @entity0 shifted $ 25 million in military aid to @entity3 forces , including @entity100 fighters in the north combating the @entity2 extremists			2
the aid could include ammunition , small arms and vehicles , as well as military education and training , @entity104 spokeswoman @entity103 said			0
@entity13 diplomatic efforts this week seek to solidify the coalition			0
secretary of state @entity113 left tuesday to push @entity11 leaders in @entity115 and @entity116 to join the @entity13 and its allies in combating @entity2 , while defense secretary @entity118 and @entity119 , the homeland security adviser , also will be in the region			2
@entity116 part of coalition " the @entity116 made very clear that they support this mission , they will join us in this mission , " a senior administration official said			0
" we are joined by very important @entity130 partners as well			0
" @entity0 has been criticized by conservatives and some democrats for what they call a timid response so far to the threat by @entity2 fighters			1
the recent beheading of two @entity13 journalists held captive by @entity2 raised public awareness of the extremists and the threat they pose			1
" we ca n't erase every trace of evil from the world , and small groups of killers have the capacity to do great harm			0
that was the case before 9/11 , and that remains true today , " @entity0 said			0
@entity2 poses a threat to the @entity152 , including the people of @entity3 and @entity4 , he said , adding : " if left unchecked , these terrorists could pose a growing threat beyond that region , including the @entity13			1
" " the next phase is offense " conservative republicans who have railed against @entity0 's foreign policy sounded relieved by what they heard			0
" the president 's plan announced this evening is an encouraging step in the right direction , " said @entity164 rep. @entity163 , who chairs the @entity165 and has been a harsh @entity0 critic			2
" @entity171 will depend on the details of its implementation			0
" his @entity164 colleage , rep. @entity175 of @entity176 , said : " tonight the president seemed to have faced reality			0
" leading @entity132 such as sen. @entity179 of @entity180 and sen. @entity181 of @entity182 praised the speech , as expected , while sen. @entity184 of @entity185 said the @entity186 he chairs would begin drafting legislation to provide @entity0 with specific authority under the @entity189 to continue to extend military operations against @entity2			1
meanwhile , the anti-war liberal caucus in the @entity63 signaled possible opposition by calling for a vote on authorizing expanded military action			0
congressional authority @entity0 has insisted he has the authority to ratchet up airstrikes against @entity2 under war powers granted more than a decade ago to fight @entity199			1
@entity2 formed from some @entity199 affiliates but is separate from the central leadership of the terrorist organization behind the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on the @entity13			1
this week , he asked @entity204 for additional authority to arm and train moderate @entity4 rebels to fight the @entity2 extremists , effectively shifting a covert operation by the @entity209 to a mission led by the @entity211			1
such authority comes under @entity213 of the @entity13 code , which deals with military powers , and @entity204 could vote on granting it next week			1
@entity216 also would allow the @entity13 to accept money from other countries for backing the @entity4 opposition forces			2
most voices in @entity204 back strong @entity13 action against the @entity2 fighters			1
however , any vote on military action can be risky , especially with congressional elections less than two months off			0
fraught politics the fraught politics of the issue were clear when @entity63 @entity164 leaders put off a vote on a government spending measure set for wednesday after pressure emerged to add the @entity234 authorization to it			0
@entity0 initially rejected arming the @entity4 opposition against president @entity237 more than two years ago to avoid getting mired in another @entity152 conflict			1
@entity13 officials also feared @entity13 weapons could end up in the hands of extremists , such as @entity199 affiliates that eventually morphed into @entity2			1
as the tide has turned against @entity4 's opposition , which now finds itself fighting both government forces and @entity2 , the @entity13 began its covert aid to some rebel factions			1
" now we have a two - year track record of relationships with the @entity4 opposition , " a senior administration official said			0
" we have far greater confidence in who we are dealing with			0
" until now , the @entity13 strategy against @entity2 has included airstrikes on the extremists in @entity3 to protect several hundred @entity13 military personnel there while helping the @entity3 and providing humanitarian support			1
veteran diplomat : @entity2 worse than @entity199 calls for a more forceful campaign against @entity2 have increased in recent months			1
former @entity13 ambassador @entity264 , who served in @entity4 , @entity3 , @entity44 and @entity265 , told @entity41 on wednesday that @entity2 presents a bigger threat to @entity13 than @entity199			1
" they are more numerous , they are better armed , they are far better financed , they are better experienced , and perhaps most critically there are several thousand of them who hold @entity274 passports , including @entity13 passports , " @entity264 said			0
" they do n't need to get a visa ; they just need to get on a plane			0
" he added : " if we do n't think we 're on their target list , we are delusional			0
" @entity0 to @entity204 : no vote needed on @entity2 strategy after his meeting with top congressional leaders at the @entity63 on tuesday , @entity0 asked for their support to show the nation was united			1
he repeated that call in wednesday 's speech			0
