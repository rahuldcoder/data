-- " agitators " triggering chaos and violence amid the protests in @entity5 , @entity6 , are n't all locals			1
of at least 78 people arrested overnight , about one in four came from outside the @entity10 area , according to the @entity11			1
nearly all the arrests were for refusal to disperse			1
two people , both locals , were charged with unlawful use of a weapon			1
and one man , from @entity18 , @entity19 , was charged with interfering with an officer			1
among those arrested are residents of @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , and @entity29 , @entity30 , according to jail records			1
@entity33 capt. @entity32 -- who is in charge of security in @entity5 -- had a lower number of arrests , telling @entity0 there were 50 and 60 late monday and into tuesday			1
" there are some outsiders , but there are ( also ) a lot of people who live here , " @entity32 told @entity0 on tuesday			1
" ... so we ca n't blame ( everything ) on outside agitators			1
" some say the arrests do not necessarily indicate wrongdoing			1
in recent days , numerous people including journalists have faced arrests after what they described as taking part in a peaceful protest or simply observing it			1
people from around the country and even other parts of the world have come to @entity5 to express outrage over the police shooting of unarmed teen @entity64			1
but all sides agree there are a select number of people -- distinct from the majority of protesters -- who are fomenting violence			2
" there is a dangerous dynamic in the night			2
it allows a small number of agitators to hide in the crowd and then attempt to create chaos , " @entity32 said late monday			2
" protesters are peaceful and respectful , " he said			2
" protesters do n't clash with police			1
... it is criminals who throw @entity85 cocktails and fire shots that endangers life and property			2
" those stirring up trouble are " fools , " said state sen. @entity91			1
" they are a disgrace to this entire movement			1
" " what we are trying to address is the intimidation and harassment of police officers onto young people , " she told @entity0			2
but by shooting guns , throwing @entity85 cocktails , and looting stores , these so - called agitators are making conditions unsafe and spurring a crackdown by authorities			2
" it completely changes the narrative , " she said monday			2
" we do n't need these antagonizers out here , " said protester @entity111 , who said he grabbed a bottle - hurling demonstrator and told him to stop			1
" we need people who can stand out here to the side and still let your word be known			0
" @entity64 's parents spoke out against the violence tuesday			0
" it is a distraction , but we wo n't let it distract us to the point where we lose focus , " @entity124 told @entity129 's " today			1
" " we have to remain focused and we have to remain strong and the violence needs to stop			0
when justice has prevailed , it may regain the trust in the locals , but right now it 's really out of control			0
" complete coverage of the @entity5 shooting and protests participants in the protests also blame the authorities for violence			0
police have fired tear gas and used stun grenades , angering some who believe the tactics are too heavy - handed and a sign of the dangers of police militarization			0
the situation presents a difficult challenge for police , said @entity153 , a former @entity154 assistant director who is now a @entity0 law enforcement analyst			0
the " normal , after - midnight clientele of the police -- these hooligans " mix in with the crowd , he said			0
" so , that is what the police have to contend with			0
" the police tried putting away the heavy weaponry at one point last week , @entity153 noted			0
but then , as late night violence broke out in recent days , " they had no alternative , and they brought them back out			0
" retired lt. gen. @entity169 , who famously defused tensions in @entity171 after @entity168 , said there 's one tactic authorities should be sure to use			0
" they have to continue to walk with the people as opposed to walk against them , " he said			0
but quelling these protests will require a political and judicial solution , he said			0
" the political and justice in this country need to find a way out of this that convinces people the right things will be done , " he said			0
some protesters , meanwhile , are trying a tactic of their own			0
on monday night , a group of community leaders formed a human chain and walked hand - in - hand -- hoping not only to provide a buffer between police and peaceful protesters , but also to block the agitators			0
