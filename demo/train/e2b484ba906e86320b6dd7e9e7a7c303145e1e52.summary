-- it is a cricket match with no bouncers , rain never stops play and the outcome is preordained			1
it is the complete antithesis to the recent @entity7 series			0
while @entity10 and @entity12 's batsmen were trying to spend hours at the crease every time they batted , the annual @entity9 fixture is a race against time -- the only thing liable to stop play is the tide			1
it is quintessentially @entity10 , a land to have spawned more than its fair share of sporting eccentricities			1
on the surface of it , this match is supremely pointless -- and actually , that remains the same even if you dig below the surface			1
for about an hour every @entity10 summer typically on an august evening , two teams in full cricketing whites from rival yachting clubs bedecked in life jackets leave the mainland and are ferried out on speedboats to a sandbank in the middle of the @entity37 , an area between the port city of @entity40 and the @entity41			1
it is a protrusion in the water that emerges above the surface only briefly on any given day and one that most sailors avoid like the plague			0
just ask the captain of the @entity48 , which ran aground on her approach to @entity40 on her last voyage in 2008 and was stuck for 90 minutes before being pulled clear by four tug boats			0
@entity52 is a different kind of captain , and he has already admitted defeat well before he will once again lead the @entity56 against the @entity57 in the @entity9 clash			0
" it 's our turn to lose this year , " he explains , " even if we score more runs and take more wickets			1
" the result is preplanned because the " defeated " team has to host a big dinner for the two sides after the event , which takes some organizing			0
the match in question is entirely dependent on the tide			1
in some years , such as 2013 , the sandbank never appears so the game goes on with water lapping against the players ' ankles -- or , in some cases , knees			1
a quaint afternoon of village cricket this is not ; there are no picnic hampers and no cream teas , just gallons and gallons of water			1
for most of the year , @entity9 stays underwater but during the equinoxal tide -- usually at the end of august or the beginning of september -- it usually emerges above the surface for a day or two			1
the time of day varies and , although the match usually takes place at 6 p.m. , it has been known to happen as early as 6 a.m. too			1
" it 's an interesting experience , " says @entity52 with a chuckle			1
" it 's great fun and we 've had some good and bad moments			1
we 've had some amazing beautiful evenings with huge amounts of sand and mud exposed , hundreds of square meters			0
and then we 've been up to our ankles like last year			0
" it can be miserable on occasions with the weather , but we usually manage to drum up enough enthusiasm			0
" among the more celebrated regulars in the match , which takes place using the usual cricket bat and ball , is @entity115 , the first person to circumnavigate the globe single - handed in 1968 and the oldest person to do so aged 67 in 2006			1
" i think i 've been playing in the match about five years now , " he says			1
" it 's totally bizarre , is n't it ? but really that 's the fun of it			1
it is n't really taken too seriously -- well , not by me			0
i 'm just happy if i manage to connect with the ball			0
really , i 'm not a brilliant cricketer			0
" the funny thing is that the cricketers in question do take it seriously , with pride at stake if nothing else			0
clips of previous matches are readily available on the internet , and the batsmen unleash all manner of heavy hitting while the fielders plunge themselves into a much wetter outfield than on any waterlogged grass pitch			2
also , as much as is possible , they stick to the gentlemanly conduct of cricket , batsmen walking -- actually wading -- if there is any doubt as to whether they are out or not			2
cricket is usually synonymous with fine weather conditions wherever it is played on the planet			2
not for the @entity9 match			2
regularly the wind lashes across the field of play , waves too , and the backdrop is n't typical either			2
just a few meters away , windsurfers and sailors pass by in their vessels , with international container ships also visible in the distance , their captains surely bemused by the bizarre spectacle taking place in the middle of the sea			0
" we usually have a lot of boats and canoes that come up and watch but these are locals , " @entity52 says			0
" sometimes i wonder what the ocean liners coming past must think			0
one year we had three liners come past in quick succession			0
i 'd love to have known what , say , the @entity177 on board must have thought watching these mad men ! " the first match is thought to have been played in the 1950s at the behest of pioneering @entity183 boatmaker @entity182			2
@entity184 designed lifeboats to be dropped from aircraft to rescued aircrew or navy personnel in @entity189 , and played an integral role in changing the design of boats for dingy racing			0
on top of that , though , he had a penchant for adventure and humor , once leading a group of @entity201 across the @entity202 from @entity10 to @entity203 and up the @entity204 without their parents ' consent			1
@entity182 died in 1972 , not long before the cricket match become cemented as an annual event in the 1980s			1
today , it starts with one of the two sailing clubs challenging the other to a match , a challenge that is always gratefully received			2
but with the result already been decided -- regardless of the runs scored and wickets taken by each team -- due to the logistics of the following feast , it further begs the question of , " what 's the point ? " but @entity115 explains : " you ca n't not have a preordained winner -- i 'm not sure the caterers could cope			1
really , part of the fun is the dinner afterwards			0
" however , not all of the 300 or so spectators who attended last year took part in the evening 's celebrations , they merely moored their boats on the bank for the hour or so of play that took place			1
there is some consolation , however , and an opportunity for those watching to quench their thirst at one of the shortest - lived pubs in @entity10 , the @entity248 -- which opens for business on the sandbank for the brief duration of play			1
with the tide quickly reconverging on the sandbank , the match is limited to six or seven overs per innings			1
" it 's very sportsmanlike , so everyone gets a turn , but it can all end very rapidly , " @entity52 says			2
" it 's quite surreal when you suddenly find yourself in the middle of the sea with water up to your chest and rising , and you 're a few meters away from the boat to take you home			2
" so what exactly is the purpose of it all ? " well , the aim is to not kill any spectators ! " adds @entity52 , before pointing out that there have been no deaths so far			0
and as a qualified doctor , he has been on hand to attend to the occasional injury to player and spectator alike over the years			0
as for the caliber of the cricket , former @entity57 captain @entity280 , a solicitor by trade , insists it is mixed			2
" i was captain by default and have n't played proper cricket for 20 years , " says the sometime wicketkeeper			2
" it 's semi-social and semi-sporting			0
" it may not be no. 1 on most people 's sporting calendar , but more than half a century since its inception this novel contest -- which regularly makes a splash -- looks here to stay .			0

a cricket match with a difference is held on a sandbank off @entity10 's south coast
barely an hour of play is possible at each match , with the tide *swallowing* the pitch
the outcome of each match , somewhat bizarrely , is decided before play begins
*legendary* solo sailor @entity115 is among the better - known players
