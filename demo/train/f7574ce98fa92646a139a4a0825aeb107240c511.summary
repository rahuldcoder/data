-- it 's the dream of millions of basketball fans around the world -- to be an @entity5 star			1
but for @entity6 , who leapt to fame with his " hellacious " dunk in an @entity10 final against the @entity12 @entity11 , playing in " the best league in the world " was not enough			1
just 27 years old and reaching his peak as a player , he has bucked convention by leaving the @entity5 and returning to his native @entity17			1
" here probably i 'm a better player , i can do everything -- not like my years in the @entity5 , " @entity6 told @entity0 's @entity19 series			1
" the @entity5 , it 's a business for sure , so when you sign a contract you have to know you might get traded to another team , another city			2
and you start playing 82 games in one season , it 's a lot of basketball			0
" @entity6 moved to the @entity12 after the 2008 @entity10 final in @entity33 , where @entity17 lost to the @entity12 , and spent three years with the @entity34			1
" they gave me the opportunity to play in the best league in the world , " he said			0
however , his later move to @entity40 was not a success -- partly due to a back injury , and partly due to a league lockout that shortened the 2011 - 12 season to 31 matches			1
in the middle of the @entity5 pay dispute , he signed an interim deal with @entity49 -- a division of one of the world 's biggest soccer clubs -- and enjoyed his time back home so much that he later took up the option of a three - year deal worth a reported â ‚ ¬ 8.1 million ( $ 10.5 million )			1
" i came here to be the leader and win trophies , " he announced on his arrival			0
@entity6 has proved as good as his word , averaging nearly 17 points per game for @entity49 in the current @entity66 season and winning rave reviews for his performances			1
@entity49 also top the domestic @entity17 league in @entity17			1
wind the clock back just over four years and @entity6 had arrived in the @entity12 to considerable fanfare after a standout performance for his beloved @entity17 in @entity73			1
playing against the might of the @entity12 -- this time dubbed the " @entity77 " following the disappointment of @entity76 -- he scored 22 points in 18 minutes of court time			0
but it was his audacious dunk over @entity82 which was a talking point of the final , eventually won 118 - 107 by the @entity12			0
despite the close attentions of the 2.11 - meter @entity82 , @entity6 -- a small forward who stands 1.98m -- brushed him aside before slamming home the two - pointer			2
the effort was described as " hellacious " by one @entity12 sports writer , who had clearly run out of superlatives , while @entity6 singles it out as a career highlight			2
he played football as a youngster on his home island of @entity95 , but basketball ability was in the family genes with both his parents players , while his elder sister @entity99 plied her trade in the @entity12 @entity101 before also returning to @entity17 with her current club @entity102			2
spotted by @entity104 - based @entity103 , @entity6 was set on the course to be a professional player from his mid-teens and was included in the @entity10 squad for the @entity76 in 2004 while only 19 years of age			1
he went to @entity34 as the 24th pick in the draft			0
" all the community from @entity34 helped me a lot with the the transition			0
the first year was difficult , but basketball is basketball , " he added			0
averaging 10.4 points and with a formidable conversion rate for three - point efforts and from the free throw line , @entity6 repaid @entity34 's faith in his abilities during his first season			1
his amazing air skills were also noted and he was picked to take part in the four - man @entity125 at the 2009 @entity126			0
@entity6 was controversially eliminated at the first round stage but had made a lasting impression , wearing a @entity130 shirt in tribute to former @entity34 star @entity132 , the first @entity133 to play in the @entity5			1
@entity132 was killed in car accident in 1989 , but had led the way for the likes of @entity137 and @entity6 at the highest level of basketball			2
he was one of @entity141 's heroes growing up , along with @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144			0
@entity137 , five years his senior , was also an inspiration			0
" @entity147 is probably one of the best players in the world , so he 's my reference , and i work every year to be better and better , " said @entity6			1
with @entity34 unable to make it past the first round of the playoffs in his time there , @entity6 went to @entity40 in a three - way trade			1
he needed surgery on his troublesome back problem but recovered in time to play at the @entity160			0
with @entity17 fielding the likes of the @entity137 brothers , @entity147 and @entity164 , @entity165 and himself , they once again came close to upsetting the all powerful @entity12 squad			0
@entity137 netted 24 points and @entity165 21 , but the @entity12 edged a thrilling gold medal match 107 - 100 , underlining @entity17 's rise as a basketball power			1
" we are probably the second team in the world			0
i remember a long time ago in the 1992 olympics in @entity104 , no team could compete against the @entity12 @entity11 , but now there 's a little bit of respect paid by them to the other teams , " @entity6 said			2
he is not the only member of that team to return to @entity17 from the @entity5			1
@entity165 left @entity181 in 2008 after just one season , and has since been an outstanding player for @entity49 's archrivals @entity104			2
" right now i think @entity165 dominates the @entity184 , " said @entity6			0
" he decided to come back to @entity17 like me and he is probably one of the best shooting guards in the world as he demonstrated in the @entity10 and in the world championships			1
" @entity165 and @entity137 would both be 36 at the time of the @entity190 , so their participation is questionable , but @entity6 is hoping to go to his fourth games			0
while @entity17 dominates football , being the reigning world and @entity199 champions , its basketball team is not far behind			2
with @entity6 on the roster , it has won the last two editions of the @entity184 and claimed the @entity202 in 2006			2
" i 'm ready for @entity203			0
i think we have a good team , a young team with @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 and myself			0
" there is still the possibility that @entity6 , a passionate music fan who has dreams of becoming a dj , will have another go at cracking the @entity5 -- if his body can withstand the strain			2
" who knows in two years , three years , i could back to the @entity5 if i start to feel better about my back			0

@entity6 has won two @entity10 basketball *silver* medals with @entity17
@entity6 enjoyed spells in @entity5 with @entity34 and @entity40
back injuries have hampered the 27 - year - old 's recent career
he opted to return to @entity17 on permanent deal with @entity49 in 2012
