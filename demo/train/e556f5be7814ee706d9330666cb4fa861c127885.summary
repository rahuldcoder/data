the @entity1 could end up cooperating with @entity2 to stop militant gains in @entity4 , secretary of state @entity0 suggested monday in an interview with @entity6 ! news			1
but a @entity9 spokesman denied monday that any military coordination with @entity2 is in the cards			1
in his interview with @entity6 ! news , @entity0 did n't say that cooperation with @entity2 is under active discussion inside the administration			1
" let 's see what @entity2 might or might not be willing to do before we start making any pronouncements , " he said			1
but he went on to say that the he " would n't rule out anything that would be constructive to providing real stability			0
" " i think we are open to any constructive process here that could minimize the violence , hold @entity4 together -- the integrity of the country -- and eliminate the presence of outside terrorist forces that are ripping it apart , " @entity0 said			1
his comments are the first time such a high - ranking @entity1 official has made such a public statement since militants from the @entity37 in @entity4 and @entity38 began an offensive that has seen vast swaths of northern @entity4 fall out of government hands			1
two senior @entity1 officials said earlier that the @entity44 administration is exploring possible direct talks with @entity2 over the deteriorating situation in @entity4			1
deputy secretary of state @entity47 is in @entity48 for nuclear talks with @entity2 and could hold discussions on the side about @entity4 with @entity2 foreign minister @entity52 , a senior administration official said in a background briefing with reporters monday			1
in fact , the @entity1 and @entity2 held " very brief discussions " about @entity4 and the threat posed by @entity61 on the sidelines of those negotiations , @entity57 spokeswoman @entity56 told @entity66 's " @entity64 with @entity65			1
" " these engagements will not include military coordination or strategic determinations about @entity4 's future over the heads of the @entity4 people , " a senior @entity57 official said			2
but in a signal the administration has n't yet reached a conclusion about what to do , two administration officials said the @entity1 was n't interested in teaming up with @entity2 because the two share few mutual interests			1
and @entity9 spokesman rear adm. @entity80 told reporters on monday that the @entity9 is n't working on a plan to cooperate with @entity2 in @entity4			1
" there are no plans to consult @entity2 on military actions inside @entity4 , " he said			1
" there is no plan to coordinate military activities			0
" @entity2 is an ally of @entity4 's @entity91 - led government , and a senior security official in @entity93 told @entity66 on friday that the country had sent about 500 @entity96 troops to help fight the @entity61 militants			1
@entity2 president @entity98 denied the report over the weekend , according to @entity2 state television , but said he would be open to helping if asked			1
despite their shared interest in stopping the advance of @entity61 fighters in @entity4 , the @entity1 is wary of furthering @entity2 's already considerable influence there			1
the @entity91 @entity2 regime is @entity108 's closest ally in the region			2
and the @entity44 administration is concerned that appearing to team up with @entity2 would both alienate @entity4 's @entity112 minority and worry @entity112 allies of the @entity1 in the region			1
but , as the crisis spreads , officials around the globe are scrambling for any way to slow the militant advance			0
@entity61 , an @entity119 splinter group , wants to establish a caliphate , or @entity122 state , that would stretch from @entity4 into northern @entity38			2
the group has had substantial success in @entity38 battling president @entity126 's security forces			0

separately , the air force killed more than 200 militants , state tv said			0
air raids against @entity61 reportedly took place in @entity140 , northwest of @entity141			0
' foreign legion ' in @entity4 and @entity38 may bring jihad to @entity144 new images emerged monday purporting to show a militant fighter interrogating and threatening to kill five captives			2
and a video appears to show a man in an @entity4 military uniform after he was shot in the face			2
the fighter boasted on @entity152 that he was proud of killing the man and said the video should be passed around to show what could happen to other @entity91			0
the new images follow others apparently posted by @entity61 to jihadi internet forums appearing to show the executions of @entity4 security forces and a tweet , on what was claimed to be an @entity61 account , saying its members had killed at least 1,700 @entity91			2
@entity66 can not independently confirm the authenticity of the images or tweets purportedly posted by @entity61			0

@entity44 's national security team met through the weekend , discussing the pros and cons of various options			2
on monday , multiple @entity1 officials told @entity66 that the @entity44 administration is considering several military options such as unarmed surveillance flights , increased intelligence - gathering and airstrikes			1
@entity1 officials have said sending ground troops to @entity4 is n't an option			1
according to a senior military official , another option under consideration by the @entity44 administration is increasing the modest number of @entity1 military advisers and trainers stationed at the @entity1 @entity227 compound in @entity93			1
expanding training programs inside and outside of @entity4 could be another option , a senior administration official said			1
the governor of @entity232 , one of the provinces that has seen heavy fighting , told @entity66 's @entity236 that he would support @entity1 airstrikes in @entity4 and @entity38			1
" i do n't think anyone is safe from these people , " gov. @entity238 said			0
but a @entity1 official said last week that even airstrikes could prove futile given the lack of credible intelligence and lack of obvious targets presented by @entity61			1
@entity1 sen. @entity247 , who has called for airstrikes against @entity61 , says approximately a dozen forward air controllers would be needed on the ground to carry out such attacks			1
" you need to have people identify the targets in order to really be effective			0
remember we 're not talking about bombing in towns and cities			0
there are long stretches of that desert that they have to travel across in their vehicles with their guns on them , " he told reporters monday on @entity261			0
@entity247 also said he does n't think @entity93 will fall to @entity61 but the group could still wreak havoc in the capital			0
" they ca n't take it			0
they have n't got enough troops and support			0
remember it 's a @entity91 city			0
but what they can do is orchestrate bombings , assassinations , create turmoil			0
but i 'm pretty confident that they ca n't take @entity93 , " the senator said			0
@entity1 sends @entity284 the @entity1 is sending about 275 troops to @entity4 to support its embassy in @entity93 , the @entity207 said in a notification to @entity288			1
they will help the @entity57 in connection with efforts to temporarily relocate some embassy staffers to consulates in @entity293 and @entity294 as well as to a support group in @entity296			0
the embassy remains open and a " substantial majority " of its presence in @entity4 will remain in place , the @entity207 said			2

oil experts say the 4 % price spike since june 6 -- which has taken a barrel of crude to $ 107 for the first time since september 2013 -- is being driven by fear that exports could be hit later this year , just as world demand peaks .			0
