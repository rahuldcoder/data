-- our minds recoil at the thought			0
how is it possible that a human being could take a knife to the neck of another , an innocent man , and cut off his head ? how could he do this even after perhaps hearing the pleas from his captive 's mother , imploring him to spare her child ? the recent slayings of journalists @entity18 and @entity20 by @entity21 , the self - described @entity22 , are only the latest acts of brutality by an organization that has strived to make ruthlessness one of its most distinctive characteristics			1
far from apologizing for its inhumanity , @entity21 advertises it proudly , it taunts the world with it , and goes to great lengths to confirm that the acts that horrify us are not the work of rogue members but are , indeed , the organization 's policy			1
cruelty is a key component of the @entity21 brand			1
the group has managed to conquer large parts of @entity46 and @entity47 with a systematic and efficient plan			0
like everything else it does , broadcasting barbarism is a calculated strategy			2
but why ? @entity53 has psychological , strategic and ideological objectives			1
that 's why other fighting forces have resorted to cruelty to achieve their objectives			1
history is replete with examples that we see echoed today			0
as we avert our eyes from the carnage , from beheadings , mass executions and crucifixions ; as we try to avoid looking at the worst of the online videos , it is apparent that the strategy has the potential to create a huge and powerful backlash			0
that cruelty is turning much of the world , including @entity74 and @entity75 , against @entity21			1
and the atrocities against @entity79 and other @entity78 citizens are all but inviting the world 's most powerful armies to take on the @entity83 militias			2
and yet , by showing its fighters massacring the enemy without mercy , by flooding social media with the gruesome images , @entity21 sends several messages that its leaders believe bring benefits that outweigh the risks			1
long before we heard what happened to @entity20 , months before we learned that @entity21 had killed hundreds of men , women and children of @entity47 's @entity101 minority , burying some of them alive , the people of the @entity94 had become acquainted with the mass executions , the brutal persecution of minorities , the killing of @entity107 , of @entity108 , and of @entity109 or anyone else who posed a challenge , hesitated to follow its religious dictates , or resisted the @entity21 advance in @entity46 and then @entity47			1
cruelty communicates fearlessness , and fearlessness , coupled with battlefield success , is an irresistible draw			0
it 's no wonder @entity21 has attracted large numbers of men eager to fight , including hundreds from @entity122			1
they share the goal , as one defector told @entity0 , of establishing an @entity127 state in the @entity74 world and then taking the campaign to other countries			0
beheading the enemy is an effective recruiting appeal to a small but not insignificant segment of the population that is enticed by the brazenness and ideological fervor			0
to them , mostly young @entity75 men , the barbarism resonates with their own brand of hatred and lust for revenge : revenge over real or perceived slights against @entity75			0
the religious justification for the executions , described by @entity21 as part of its jihad -- a war to return the reign of an @entity127 caliphate and impose the @entity154 's dictates -- gives the killings moral , theological clearance , all but precluding empathy toward non-members			1
in addition , by advertising its methods , @entity21 intimidates the armies it faces , causing some soldiers to flee before battle , even leaving their weapons behind , as we saw when @entity21 took over @entity167			1
the executions of hundreds of enemy soldiers , those who chose to fight , have appeared in videos , a warning to others			0
and the method also works to keep populations in line after @entity21 takes over territory and enforces its rule			1
the people of @entity179 , the @entity21 " capital " in @entity46 , have seen men crucified in the streets , a punishment for transgressions that serves as warning to anyone who might plan to defy the new authorities ' rule and their version of @entity188 , @entity127 law			2
@entity21 is not the first organization to use barbarism as a weapon of war ; to use cruelty as a method of policy enforcement			1
in the @entity202 , the @entity196 , an institutionalized effort to root out heresy and strengthen the hold of the @entity200 and its allies , made it well known that those who did not fully comply with its wishes would suffer unspeakable punishments , from torture to being burned alive			0
many militant movements throughout history have managed to erase from their followers an essential element of their humanity -- a part that we think could never be destroyed inside us			0
we can not imagine deliberately inflicting pain on another , particularly someone who has not harmed us			0
but it turns out that our restraints against cruelty can be destroyed			0
history is replete with examples : the millions killed by the @entity223 in @entity224 , as they sought to build a communist utopia			1
the industrialized killing factories built by @entity228 during @entity229 , which had no military value , playing the key role within @entity228 ideology of exterminating unwanted people , principally @entity233 , but also the disabled , homosexuals , @entity235 ( @entity235 ) and other " inferior " peoples			2
the genocide in @entity240 , in which ethnic hatred unleashed a genocidal wave that left 800,000 dead , most hacked with machetes by their neighbors			2
other @entity245 groups operating today have shown no compunction about killing civilians , women and children , about kidnapping girls in @entity251 , about blowing up city markets in @entity253 , buses in @entity255 , restaurants , cafes , and hotels in @entity259 , @entity260 , or @entity261			0
the common denominator throughout history until today is an ideology that justifies everything for the search of a " higher " goal , one usually suffused with some utopian vision of a perfect world			2
it is a world that has no room for anyone who disagrees with those seeking to make it a reality and finds in cruelty a recruiting tool for the cause and a fully justified method in pursuit of ultimate success			2
along the way , it turns men who were once presumably normal , even lovable children , into black - hooded executioners capable of taking a knife to the neck of a man kneeling at their feet			0

@entity292 : @entity21 celebrates its brutality and taunts the world with it
@entity297 : barbarism is @entity21 policy , with strategic and psychological objectives
@entity297 : policy of @entity228 , @entity240 , @entity223 , @entity303 , too
@entity297 : @entity21 uses cruelty to recruit ; justifies it for the sake of creating a " utopia "
