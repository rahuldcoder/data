-- in order to maintain peace at home , president - elect @entity1 might want to have some very important talks with his wife and mother - in - law before moving into the @entity8			1
president - elect @entity1 's mother - in - law @entity9 joins him on stage on election night			1
like some 4 million other multigenerational @entity14 households @entity1 's mother - in - law , @entity9 , will join the @entity15 at the family 's private quarters at @entity8			1
in about 1.3 million @entity14 homes where the parents are head of the household , at least one grandparent lives with the family			1
having a grandparent living with a family can be a wonderful and beneficial addition to the family , says psychologist @entity27 , but only if everyone can navigate the boundaries			1
the key issues that need to be discussed between grandparents and parents are privacy and the discipline of the children , says the psychologist , who practices in @entity36 , @entity37			1
@entity38 agrees and says having those discussions and setting ground rules ahead of time is better than making it up as you go along because then feelings can get hurt			0
@entity38 always knew her parents , @entity47 and @entity48 , would one day live with her and says she could n't have survived without them after she and her husband separated			2
but disagreements over the disciplining of her two children sparked conflict			0
" we 've had some knock - down , drag - outs about discipline -- especially with my dad , " the @entity60 , @entity61 , woman says , " i finally had to say , ' i 'm the mom -- you 're not -- do n't tell me how to raise my kids			1
' " on the flip side , @entity38 's mother would like to be just a grandmother who spoils @entity67 and @entity68 -- instead of having to play disciplinarian while @entity38 is working as a nurse - anesthetist			1
the @entity71 have a separate apartment in the lower level of @entity38 's home , but spend winters at their own home in @entity77			2
that gives them all a break from each other			0
@entity38 describes it as a " four - month time to really appreciate them " for all the cooking , cleaning and home maintenance her parents do along with the childcare			1
she and the children miss the grandparents so much during this time that they usually make one trip to @entity77 so they can spend time with " @entity93 " the ' aaah , go away ! ' effect along with establishing guidelines for everyone 's role , @entity27 says both the parents and grandparents need to address privacy issues			1
" i think privacy is key -- making sure that everybody has a place where they can have some privacy , " says @entity27			1
@entity38 says she sometimes wishes she could have a little more privacy in the evenings now that she is working days			0
she gets home from work and spends the evening with her children and after they go to sleep she looks forward to some time by herself			0
but sometimes her mother comes upstairs to chat			0
" that 's when i want to say , ' ahhh , go away ! " says @entity38			0
" i do n't say that , but i 'm thinking it			0
" and even if everyone agrees on a plan ahead of time , it would be wise to expect irritations to pop up every now and then , the therapist says			0
" trying to live together is really about problem solving , " @entity27 says			1
she tells her clients if they all focus on finding a solution to the problem and making it a win - win for everyone involved , it takes the emotions and hurt feelings out of the equation			2
clearing the air @entity27 suggests holding a family meeting where either party could say he or she is feeling stressed about an issue or someone lacks enough privacy			2
but watch out for red flags during discussions prior to inviting your mother or mother - in - law to move in			1
" if you really do n't communicate well with this person , and when you try to communicate your feelings and ideas it always ends up in a battle -- then it 's probably not a good plan to have them move in with you , " says @entity27			0
@entity155 knows family meetings are a good place to clear the air and discuss problems			1
she had asked her mother , @entity160 , to move in to help her with childcare upon her return to work			0
but her mom moved in earlier than planned after granddaughter @entity165 arrived by caesarean section			0
the @entity167 , @entity168 , paralegal and her husband , @entity170 , had discussed many issues with her mother and everyone laid out their expectations of each other , with the couple telling her mother that they would handle all the household expenses			0
but the @entity180 called another family meeting after @entity160 moved in because they felt she was trying to help too much			0
" we let her know that we wanted her here to just help us with @entity165 and she did n't necessarily have to do any housework as far as cooking or cleaning or fixing our lunches			0
" @entity155 also makes sure @entity165 's bottles are prepared so that her mother 's day goes a little smoother and grandma is not so busy while tending to her seventh grandchild			2
@entity155 says she thanks @entity189 daily for her mother 's help because it gives her extra time to spend with her baby daughter in the morning			2
and @entity155 can carry @entity165 down the hallway to her mother 's room instead of dressing the infant , and packing all her supplies and bottles into a diaper bag and driving her to daycare			2
@entity155 says she , her husband and her mother took several trips together while she was out on maternity leave			0
and every other weekend , her mother stays with @entity155 's sister 's family			1
in the five - bedroom @entity155 house , personal space and privacy is not an issue			2
and the couple tries to get out once a month for " date night			0
" the only problem @entity155 is having with her mother living with her is @entity160 's cooking : " she is a great cook , and it 's hard , " @entity155 says with a laugh , " but i 'm staying very disciplined			1

@entity221 's mother is moving into @entity8 with first family
expert : parents should discuss discipline styles , privacy with mother - in - law
@entity230 : those talks should take place before mother - in - law moves in
psychologist : living together *successfully* is about problem solving
