-- @entity2 's top military official nudged the nation 's newest class of officers saturday to fight a different sort of battle and close a gap between themselves and civilians who do not always understand a soldier 's sacrifice			1
navy adm. @entity13 , the chairman of the @entity14 , told graduating cadets at the @entity16 at @entity16 that despite a decade at war , men and women in uniform are not always on the radar of @entity2 's non-military families			1
" our work is appreciated , of that i am certain , " @entity13 said in a commencement speech saturday			2
" there is n't a town or a city i visit where people do not convey to me their great pride in what we do			0
" " but i fear they do not know us			0
i fear they do not comprehend the full weight of the burden we carry or the price we pay when we return from battle , " he said			0
he spoke to more than 1,000 young officers who grew up with @entity2 at war in @entity43 and @entity44			1
" when this country was attacked on 9/11 , most of you were just 11 or 12 years old , " @entity13 said			2
" we 've been at war nearly half your young lives			0
yet all you made a choice freely to serve your country			0
" he said he was giving the newly commissioned officers an additional assignment over their duty to serve			2
@entity2 's all - volunteer military of 1.4 million members , he said , was a small , insular force compared to the general population -- scattered on bases across @entity2 or deployed to faraway places			1
it was imperative that the public know more about the men and women who choose to serve , he said			0

both @entity13 and defense secretary @entity75 have previously sounded concern over potential alienation of the military and have urged more dialogue to end the disconnect .			1
