what can president @entity0 realistically do in his final two years ? beyond executive action , his power to impact public policy is limited			1
pundits can talk all they want about the president being " more aggressive " in his @entity9 address and report on how he wo n't be willing to be passive when faced with @entity11 opposition , but the truth is that @entity11 control @entity13			1
most in the @entity11 will have little interest in cutting deals with the president			2
the odds of passing major legislation are slim			0
even if the president fights tooth and nail , the nation wo n't see another @entity23 or @entity24 in the coming years			2
as a number of experts have explained , he can continue to use executive power , but that , too , is limited in terms of what he can achieve on the domestic front			0
executive power only applies to a limited number of changes within existing law , and these decisions can be overturned by the next president			2
yet there is something that the president can focus on in the coming months to significantly strengthen his long - term impact on the nation : help democrats do well in the 2016 election			1
president @entity0 's best bet is to establish the conditions that improve the odds for a @entity51 president and @entity13 to succeed him			1
in many respects , most lame duck presidencies are more about the future than the present			1
if @entity57 expand their power in 2016 , they will be in better position to protect and nurture the programs , such as the @entity61 , that have passed during @entity0 's tenure in the @entity63			1
and the longer that policies remain in place , the more voters and organized interests become invested in those programs and determined to protect the status quo			0
as the president did in a forceful @entity9 , he must continue to flood the agenda with ideas and issues that will excite and engage @entity57			0
there are many @entity57 who feel deeply disillusioned after so many of the promises from 2008 remained unfulfilled , such as taming the role of money in politics , putting stringent regulations on @entity82 or restoring the balance between civil liberties and counterterrorism			0
some have concluded that a broken @entity87 is impervious to change while others have lamented how a rightward drifting @entity11 has dominated @entity90 and stifled the administration from making substantial progress			0
still other @entity57 have complained that @entity0 has not put up enough of a fight and has been too willing to compromise his principles			2
even if the odds of @entity13 passing bills based on @entity0 's proposals are slim , the president can help generate ongoing media discussion about key issues -- such as income inequality or middle class insecurity -- that play well for @entity51 presidential candidates			1
as we have already seen in some of the early buzz from potential @entity11 presidential candidates such as @entity108 , @entity11 are feeling defensive about the perception that they only represent the wealthiest @entity111			0
through speeches and proposals , @entity0 can keep this issue , and others like climate change or immigration reform , on the table so that @entity51 voters remember what 's at stake in 2016 when they vote for the next president			1
the president can also help make sure that the next congressional elections in 2016 go as well as possible for his party			1
president @entity0 has learned the hard way that without a supportive @entity13 , not much gets done			1
since 2010 , when @entity11 took control of @entity13 , @entity90 has been rough sledding for the administration			2
one of his problems has been that president @entity0 's relations with @entity57 have been continually tense			1
many congressional @entity57 have felt that the president has not done enough to support them in midterm elections , including in 2014 , at the same time that he has sent extraordinarily controversial proposals , such as the @entity61 , to them that create electoral problems back home			0
in 2016 , @entity57 probably have very little opportunity to win control of the @entity63 given the size of @entity11 margins and the fact that gerrymandered districts make it unlikely to have big swings in @entity63 elections			2
however , they do have a chance to retake control of the @entity152 since more @entity11 seats will be at risk and @entity57 can have better turnout with a strong presidential candidate on the ticket			0
in the coming years , the administration needs to work carefully and closely with @entity57 in competitive states such as @entity160 to ensure they have support , organizational enthusiasm and money			0
the final question will be how the president interacts with the @entity51 presidential candidate			0
this has always been difficult , as was evident with vice president @entity168 in 2000 when his awkward relationship with president @entity170 hurt his candidacy			0
this will be extraordinarily important when the top candidate emerges			0
assuming the @entity51 nominee will be the undeclared but widely acknowledged frontrunner , @entity175 , the president will have to put aside some of the tensions that have existed with her to make sure that the candidacy runs as smoothly as possible			0
what happens after a president leaves office is as important as what a president does while in power			0
the success of @entity187 and the @entity188 remain the most lasting monument to @entity190 , while the endurance of so many of president @entity193 's @entity24 programs during the @entity194 enabled many @entity111 to remember his impressive domestic accomplishments in spite of the tragedy of @entity198			2
president @entity199 ensured that @entity201 's moves to reach peace with the @entity203 in 1987 did not go to waste , while @entity11 and @entity57 in @entity13 have entrenched most of the national security programs president @entity206 put into place			1
president @entity0 needs to keep his eyes on 2016			1
realistically , this is the best way that he can bolster his own legacy and that of his party -- helping to set up political tools that @entity57 will need to thrive once he is back in @entity215 or @entity216 and preventing the emergence of a conservative political coalition that would pick apart the achievements of the @entity0 presidency			1

@entity222 : as a lame duck with @entity13 , @entity0 's powers are limited
he says best focus for the president is to position his party to win in 2016
