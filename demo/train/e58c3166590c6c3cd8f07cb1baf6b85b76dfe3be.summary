@entity0 -- he 's designed everything from upscale hotels and restaurants to the sets for @entity8 plays and the @entity10 ceremony			1
so you might think that creating a kids ' playground would n't appeal to world - renowned architect @entity14			1
@entity14 , a father of two , became frustrated when he took his kids to traditional playgrounds			1
he found that these play areas lacked creativity			1
" traditional playgrounds are geared toward gross motor skills and linear play ... they are largely made of fixed equipment : seesaws , slides , monkey bars , swings , " @entity14 said			1
" they are fantastic places to build gross motor skills			0
" so he decided to design a playground that focused on building imagination by letting the kids build the playground themselves			1
the first of his @entity35 opened in july in lower @entity36			1
" [ @entity37 ] is a totally manipulatable playground in which every part of it allows kids to create their own constantly transformable play escape			1
" visiting the playground in lower @entity36 is an adventure			1
it 's not every day , as a @entity1 reporter , i get to cross over a moat and dodge pipes and water noodles while getting doused with the occasional water splash			2
in a world of endless standardized tests and regimented schedules , @entity14 's playground is meant to encourage creative thinking , teamwork and risk taking			1
at first , it looks like a regular playground , but look closer , and there are no swings or monkey bars			2
instead , there 's water , real sand , big blue foam pieces in many different shapes , shovels , wheelbarrows , balls and lots of running space			2
kids have to work together here : two boys are dragging foam pieces from the sand to the water , while another group stacks them			0
when i ask why they 're doing all this work , they say , " to close the hole in our bridge			0
" most of the groups of kids have just met each other in the playground on this very day			1
@entity87 , 10 , stopped and pointed to a shapeless stack of blue foam wedges			0
" see , that 's a boat you can float on , " she said			0
" i was actually kind of helping make it			0
" she says she just met the kids who helped her build it in the park today			0
we spoke with @entity14 in the playground as two kids pushed past us with a wheelbarrow filled with foam blocks , while others built what @entity14 guessed was " a raft city			1
" @entity104 , he described it as " a humbling experience for a control freak architect			0
" " one hundred percent of the time , the kids do not use the objects in the way i designed them to be used , " he said			1
@entity14 likes to visit the playground to see what new ideas kids have developed for his foam pieces			1
" we 're finding that kids are so over-programmed and have so little free time that when they get here , their own little creative potential is unleashed , " he said			0
it took him more than five years to build @entity37 , and he did n't do it alone			1
he consulted with play experts and conducted focus groups watching kids use prototypes of the foam			2
@entity125 , one of the play experts who worked with @entity14 on @entity37 , would like to see more playgrounds like it			1
" it 's all about avoiding risk in most playgrounds , so it 's been dumbed down and there 's less and less kids can do , " @entity130 explained			1
this one is different because " everything can be invented , reinvented , and this is critical for how kids learn			0
this enables kids to make their own decisions , to see cause and effect by building up , destroying , building again , " she said			0
but building more playgrounds like this one wo n't be cheap : @entity14 donated his time and design expertise and helped raise money for the project			1
the @entity151 donated $ 4.4 million , and the city of @entity0 threw in an additional $ 3 million to get the underground pipes in working order			2
@entity130 believes these kinds of play experiences help prepare kids for environments where not everything is controlled			2
" here , nothing is fixed , nothing is predetermined , and they can see consequences , learn to make decisions , " @entity130 said			0
" they learn that not everything is already laid out for you in a way in which it 's always going to be perfect : it 's possible to fail			0
" @entity170 brought her daughter to the park for the first time while we were there			0
" i love it , " she said as she watched her daughter help another little girl carry a large white pipe across the playground			0
" she just seems to be creating things and interacting with younger and older kids			0
it 's been a great experience so far			0
" @entity14 is trying to raise a $ 5 million endowment to sustain the playground , which has some atypical costs , including replacing the foam pieces and paying for two " play assistants " who oversee the kids			1
@entity14 is also exporting the idea to other cities			2
he 's made portable versions of the playground , which he calls " @entity194 " -- each contains the foam pieces and other loose parts			2
@entity14 says they 're now in some parks and children 's museums around the country			1
they cost between $ 7,600 and $ 11,700			2
he does n't make money off this project			0
he says he does it because he believes it makes a difference , and he 'd like to build more full - scale @entity209 in other cities around the country			0
@entity14 smiled as we watched two girls try to dam up a waterspout			2
" i love working for these constituents , " he said			0
" they are my most interesting clients			0

@entity14 designed @entity10 sets , @entity222 restaurants and @entity223
a father of two , the architect found traditional playgrounds *uninspiring*
he created @entity37 , where kids use teamwork and creativity to play
@entity36 playground cost more than $ 7 million ; he 's seeking $ 5 million more to sustain it
