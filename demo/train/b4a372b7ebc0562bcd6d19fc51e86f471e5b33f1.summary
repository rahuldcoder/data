@entity0 , @entity1 -- he has not formally appeared in public for years , and recently he 's been battling illness inside a @entity7 hospital			0
but former @entity1 president @entity8 is still a beloved icon across the world , an international symbol of courage , strength and hope			2
the 95 - year - old @entity16 laureate is also one of the world 's most recognizable figures			0
more than just a man , he has become a global brand -- one that 's estimated to be worth millions of dollars			1
ever since @entity8 was released from prison , where he had endured 27 years for fighting apartheid , many @entity1 have felt like they 'd like to " own " a little piece of him			2
as a result , the smiling image of @entity8 , as @entity8 is affectionately referred to by @entity1 , has been emblazoned on all sorts of memorabilia , items that are usually not associated with his legacy -- everything from t - shirts and place mats to banknotes and even salt and pepper shakers			1
read this : @entity8 posters mark 95th birthday some members of @entity8 's own family have also been accused of cashing in on the anti-apartheid icon 's legacy , using the world - renowned name for business ventures such as a collection of wines , called the " @entity49 , " or a clothing range branded with his prison number or an image of his hand			1
more recently , two of his granddaughters -- @entity56 and @entity57 -- starred in their own reality tv series , " being @entity8 , " in which the family showed some of the @entity8 - branded products			1
in answer to critics accusing them of tarnishing the @entity8 name , his granddaughters say it 's their name too , and that they are treating it with respect and integrity			1
" you ca n't tell people how not to celebrate their father , or grandfather , or great grandfather , because they are using their own name , " says @entity70 , head of the @entity71 , which @entity8 founded to continue his work after he retired			2
" it would be arrogant ... to say you ca n't use your name so it 's ensuring that we stick to what we believe is the legacy , " he continues			0
speaking to @entity2 earlier this year , @entity8 's daughter @entity87 , who is behind the wine brand , said that using the family name is important because it promotes @entity1 , as well as a good product			1
she added that her father had told her : " if you use the name either for commercial or charitable or political ( purposes ) , use it with a lot of integrity and responsibility			0
" in photos : global tributes to @entity8 but how can @entity8 's legacy and values be balanced with the commercial potential of his image ? @entity70 says that when @entity8 's name was used by @entity106 without permission , there was a public backlash			1
" when @entity8 was turning 90 , they put up their own ad saying , ' @entity8 turns 90 , @entity106 turns 10 , ' " explains @entity70			0
" and it was members of the public who objected , so it tells you that the legacy of @entity8 is not just being preserved by us but it 's being preserved and protected by many others			0
" watch this : turning @entity8 's life into a blockbuster while it 's still unclear exactly who will control the " @entity123 " in the years to come , the way @entity8 's legacy and image endures seems to depend on all those who have a stake in it -- from his family and his party , the @entity131 , to the people of @entity1			1
those who know him say he is comfortable with that , never prescribing how he should be honored			0
" we tend to not want to recognize @entity8 as a brand , " says @entity70			2
" he represents something in humanity that we should all have			0
