@entity0 has become the latest nation to join the international coalition fighting @entity4 , with prime minister @entity5 telling lawmakers tuesday 143 military personnel were deploying to @entity8 in a non-combat role			1
in a two - year mission likely to start in may , @entity0 personnel will train @entity8 security forces at the @entity13 north of @entity14 , @entity5 said			1
he said soldiers would provide protection for the training force			0
@entity5 said @entity4 -- also known as the @entity4 ( @entity4 ) -- posed a threat to stability in regions beyond the @entity21 and @entity0 had " an obligation " to help support the rule of law internationally			1
" @entity0 is a country that stands up for its values			2
we stand up for what is right , " he told parliament			0
" we do not shy away from taking our share of the burden when the international rules based system is threatened as it is today			0
" @entity5 said attacks in @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 had underscored the risk of complacency			2
" to those who argue that we should not take action because it raises the threat , i say this ' the risk associated with @entity4 becoming stronger and more widespread far outweighs this			2
' " in a statement , @entity5 referred to @entity0 as " prolific travelers " who were not immune from the risk posed by @entity4			1
" @entity4 's brutality has only worsened and its outrageous actions have united an international coalition of around 62 countries to fight and degrade the group , " he said			1
who 's doing what in the coalition battle against @entity4 ? opposition leaders were quick to condemn the decision , which they said should have been debated and voted on in parliament			2
labour leader @entity58 said his party was opposed to sending troops to @entity8 and that it was unlikely they would remain behind the front line			1
" the prime minister says they will be behind the wire but we know they will not be			1
they can not stick there , they can not stay there , that is not all they will do			0
they will not just be behind the wire ; they will be exposed to the much wider conflict ; it will not be just the soldiers we send to the @entity8 , it will be @entity0 traveling around the world , " @entity58 said			1
@entity84 leader @entity83 said @entity5 was " dragging @entity0 into someone else 's war without a mandate " and was making the country and its citizens unnecessary targets for @entity4			1
@entity92 leader @entity91 said @entity5 had made a " giant turnaround " since ruling out a troop deployment			2
" nothing has changed in @entity8 , except ' his club ' persuaded mr @entity5 to commit our troops , " @entity91 said in a statement			1
' not taken lightly ' @entity5 said the government had carefully considered @entity0 's contribution to the coalition			1
" a training mission like this is not without danger and this is not a decision we have taken lightly , " he said			1
" i have required assurances that our men and women will be as safe as they can practicably be in @entity13			0
the deployment came at the request of the @entity8 government and was likely to be a joint training mission with neighboring @entity115 , @entity5 said			1
@entity0 's cabinet would review the deployment after nine months , he added			2
the @entity118 is leading the coalition to fight @entity4 from the sky over @entity8 and @entity121			1
the militant group has declared an @entity4 caliphate in the area and demanded that all @entity125 pledge allegiance to its leader -- @entity128			2
@entity129 from the @entity130 at @entity0 's @entity131 said @entity0 's commitment to the coalition would likely be dangerous for its citizens in the @entity21 region			2
" there is definitely a risk in joining the international effort and that risk is first of all that @entity0 personnel in the region will become a more identifiable target , " he told @entity1			2
" the secondary risk is that @entity0 involvement in the international effort will radicalize people in @entity0 and or @entity115			2
i think that 's a very small risk because i do n't think there are many potential extremists in @entity0			0
" @entity4 did not directly pose a threat to @entity0 domestically , @entity129 said			1
" the only influence they have is an indirect one			0
if they start showing pictures of civilians killed by @entity158 bombing that might involve someone living in @entity160 or @entity161 or elsewhere who might decide off their own bat to commit an act of violence			0
" @entity129 warned that the conflict would likely escalate and said that @entity0 had no clear exit strategy			0
" involvement just keeps going forward rather than backwards -- it will be very hard to disentangle , " he said			0
" it seems to me like a bit of a knee - jerk reaction to the admittedly horrific propaganda videos produced by @entity4			0
the other problem is that @entity4 has a plan and that plan is to suck in @entity158 troops so that they can fight them on the ground			1
" political arguments @entity182 , professor of strategic studies at @entity184 in @entity185 said that had @entity5 's government opted to allow parliament to vote on the deployment it likely would have failed to win majority support			1
" it 's been clear for some time that the government was intending to make a military contribution , " he said			0
" it 's become an issue of considerable division between the government on the one hand and the opposition on the other			0
" @entity0 's successful pitch to join the @entity203 @entity202 involved presenting itself as a country that had an independent foreign policy , and may have been a factor in the delaying the commitment , @entity182 said			0
the delay had also provided opposition parties with plenty of opportunity to poke holes in the government 's argument for joining the coalition , he said			0
comments @entity5 made in january about involvement being " the price of the club , " had fed into the opposition @entity221 's argument that being independent meant having " the ability to say no from time to time , " @entity182 said			0
" it 's quite possible that the government felt that it could get wider public support if this was just a training mission , but it has n't been able to convince the opposition , " @entity182 said			1
" for the opposition this is like ' let 's not repeat 2003 [ the @entity8 invasion ]			0
' this is of course not like 2003 , this is not an unrequested invasion , " he said			0
" given that there are 62 countries in the coalition it 's not like @entity8 in 2003			0
it 's almost as if opposition parties in @entity0 are wanting to avoid the last war			0
" the @entity118 said it welcomed @entity0 's contribution			0
" as one of our partners in the coalition , @entity0 has already provided substantial humanitarian assistance to @entity8 and @entity121			1
" we value the contributions and efforts of all partners in the mission as we work together on a multifaceted and long - term strategy to degrade and defeat @entity4 , " @entity250 spokeswoman @entity249 said in a statement .			1
