-- @entity1 claims that brainwashing explains why so few blacks support conservative @entity4 such as himself			1
the thinking , sentiments , and policy preferences he supports give good cause for rejecting him			2
in his new campaign manifesto , " this is @entity1 : my journey to the @entity15 , " the candidate states repeatedly and without qualification that " @entity16 did their job ... a great job			1
" he makes no mention of the blacks who fled @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 during the @entity23 in search of their freedom , or the @entity27 's protection of slavery , or that the initial @entity27 forbade @entity29 from prohibiting @entity31 participation in the international slave trade for 20 years and indeed made that provision unamendable			1
@entity1 evinces no recognition of the @entity36 ' role in erecting a cruel pigmentocracy that continues to poison virtually every aspect of @entity31 political , social and cultural life			1
this is not an abstruse or academic matter			0
the president nominates federal judges			0
an important theory of constitutional interpretation vying for ascendancy is originalism : the notion that the @entity27 should be read as originally understood by its framers			0
justice @entity50 is the most militant originalist on the @entity52			0
a president @entity1 would seek to fill the federal judiciary with more @entity54 -- a prospect that most blacks rightly view with dread			1
asked about his impressions of the @entity60 dissidents , @entity1 declared : " do n't blame the big banks			1
if you do n't have a job and you 're not rich , blame yourself " -- a statement that overlooks the desperation with which millions , a disproportionate number of whom are black , strive to stave off impoverishment and unemployment			1
later , when @entity1 perceived the impolitic character of his comment , he tried to minimize it , asserting that he was only referring to the protesters and not to the impoverished or unemployed in general			1
that attempt at damage control rings false , however , especially in light of his further comment : " it is not a person 's fault if they succeeded , it is a person 's fault if they failed			2
" largely located on the lower rungs of the @entity31 socioeconomic ladder , most black @entity84 appreciate sources of opportunity and power that @entity1 despises : unions , governmental support for the needy , a robust , government - supported full - employment policy , the public provision of health care			2
his worry , remarkably , is that @entity84 is too egalitarian			0
his signature policy -- the 9 - 9 - 9 tax reform proposal -- would institute a regressive consumption tax nationally and starve @entity101 and @entity102			1
it would redistribute income upward			1
no wonder blacks overwhelmingly repudiate him and his tea party allies			2
@entity1 also recently declared : " i do n't believe racism in this country today holds anybody back in a big way			1
" if there were any doubts before that he was bereft of the knowledge and sensibility required of a significant political figure , much less president , then this egregious statement should remove them			0
a library full of careful , rigorous studies shows clearly that invidious racial discrimination and , perhaps even more consequentially , the perpetuation of disabilities inflicted by racial mistreatment in the past hurt blacks and other people of color in a broad array of domains : from commercial transactions like buying a car or purchasing a home , to dealing with police , to electoral politics , to wellness and life expectancy			2
not only are people of color discriminated against with frequency			0
not only are the accumulated burdens of past discrimination permitted to prey upon new generations even in the absence of racial malevolence ( complacency is deadly too )			0
but studies also show that the darker you are , the more likely you are to face wrongful indifference or cruel mistreatment			0
( take a peek at the illuminating article by @entity154 and @entity155 , " @entity156 and the @entity157 , " in the december 2007 edition of @entity159			0
) of course , there has been remarkable , positive change in @entity31 racial attitudes			0
but recall the miserable baseline against which we mark that progress			0
in 1958 , the @entity166 asked whether @entity84 would be willing to vote for a qualified black presidential candidate nominated by their own party			0
three in five white @entity84 answered " no. " the election of @entity171 is a vivid illustration of the extent to which racial attitudes have evolved			0
but neither @entity171 's residency in the @entity15 , nor @entity1 's current surge , nor the emergence of an @entity31 affluent class negates the fact that fresh racism and the unhealed wounds of racial injuries inflicted in the past give rise to conditions , observable everywhere , that dishonor the best of @entity31 ideals			1
it is because of @entity1 's denial of these realities that most blacks will continue , understandably , to view him as unfit for high political office			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity195 .			2

@entity195 : @entity1 lauds founding *fathers* , ignoring the fact they protected slavery
@entity195 : @entity1 says blame yourself if you 're *jobless* and dismisses *documented* racism
@entity1 would cut @entity101 and @entity102 , he says , and redistribute income upward
@entity195 *writes* that @entity1 's policies are *anti-black* and blacks reject him for that
