-- a perpetual deadlock in @entity2 has resulted in eight extensions of the national transportation bill , causing roads to crumble , bridges to fall , and transit to break down			0
come march 2012 , politicians will once again enter into a political debate about funding @entity11 mobility			2
without a fiscal safety net in place , the @entity12 will go broke			0
the @entity16 majority in @entity2 wo n't permit the transfer of federal funds from its general spending account to bolster the @entity12			0
and despite the rationality of a user - fee system , neither party will lead the charge to raise the gasoline tax			2
few taxes provoke more fury than those at the fuel pump and 2012 is an election year			0
in reality , cutting the gas tax exacts a steep cost on the entire economy			1
the gas tax funds a broad range of economy - bolstering transportation projects across the country and it is already too low to meet current ( and future ) infrastructure needs			1
it 's time to debunk the myths surrounding the maligned gas tax			1
@entity11 already pay too much in gas taxes			1
@entity11 actually taxes gasoline less than most other nations			2
only two countries — @entity49 and @entity50 — charge lower gas taxes than the @entity11 and both are net global oil suppliers , not consumers			1
the @entity11 is the world 's largest oil consumer			2
by under - taxing gasoline -- and thus under - pricing gasoline -- the @entity11 encourages over-dependency			1
furthermore , the federal gas tax does not even come close to covering the wide array of external social costs of driving cars and trucks			1
gas taxes rise every year			0
the federal gas tax has remained unchanged at 18.4 cents for a gallon of gasoline ( and 24.4 cents for diesel ) for nearly two decades			1
it is not indexed to the price of crude oil or inflation , so @entity11 pay a fixed amount whether oil prices are high or low			2
ironically , given today 's debate , the last time the gas tax was raised in 1993 was for deficit reduction purposes			1
taking inflation into account , the gas tax has eroded to only 11 cents today			1
this has seriously diminished the ability to pay for infrastructure , with a purchasing power of 45 cents in gas taxes for every dollar in national highway construction costs			2
this means that only one - half of the transportation investments made since 1993 could be afforded today , even though @entity92 has grown 55 % and demands ( vehicle miles traveled ) have grown 29 %			0
gas taxes are unnecessary because the transportation system is paid for in other ways			0
@entity11 's transportation system is going broke			1
revenue for the @entity12 is derived almost entirely from federal gas taxes and distributed to all 50 states			0
it covers nearly 80 % of the capital costs of federally - funded transportation projects , with states carrying the remainder			1
from 2008 to 2010 , @entity2 transferred $ 34.5 billion from general fund revenues to make up the funding shortfall			0
this stopgap measure was necessary to continue projects that are already in the works			0
moreover , deferred maintenance — the failure to care for existing roads and bridges — combined with lost productivity are estimated to add more than $ 100 billion to the national deficit annually			0
over time , technology will help expand mobility options and improve system efficiency			0
this includes the ability to track real - time data and charge for system use and facilitate trip decision - making through virtual communications -- social networking , skype , real - time ride - sharing , and on - line meetings			0
will pay - per - mile road taxes buzzkill the great @entity11 road trip ? these 21st - century interactions will bolster economic productivity and competitiveness			1
but they will take time to mature and , in the near - term , will not obviate the need for travel			0
moreover , a dedicated source of revenues , such as gas taxes or other user - based fees , will remain critical to fund and facilitate the transition to technology - oriented transportation solutions			1
transportation taxes are detrimental to @entity11 competitiveness			2
the reverse is true when it comes to gas taxes			0
investing in transportation facilitates reinvestment in @entity11 that is vital to economic growth			2
the @entity11 , once no. 1 in the world for its infrastructure , has fallen to 15th			2
@entity159 and @entity160 are cruising ahead with transportation infrastructure investments each at 9 % of gdp compared to 2 % in the @entity11 this lackluster level of investment prevails despite well - documented needs — aging infrastructure , growing population , and shifting demographics			1
an upgraded , well - maintained , operationally - efficient transportation system , on the other hand , offers a significant competitive edge			0
plus , the gas tax spreads the burden over hundreds of millions of system beneficiaries			1
beyond system efficiency gains , vehicles themselves are becoming more fuel - efficient and less wasteful			0
a proposal to double car - and suv - fuel economy standards by 2025 , while highly beneficial in terms of energy will translate into lower gas tax expenditures by higher - mpg cars			1
the rational way to deal with this is to increase gas taxes slightly over time to account for the fiscal impacts that cleaner , more efficient cars have on transportation infrastructure @entity188 5			2
gas taxes make an already volatile gasoline market even worse			0
domestic gas prices are largely influenced by world oil markets			0
with transportation accounting for about 70 % of @entity11 oil consumption and record oil - company profits reached when world oil prices go up , it 's only fair that oil companies share the cost of providing transportation infrastructure			1
structuring an oil fee assessed on producers and a variable gas tax paid by consumers can further stabilize the price at the pump			1
when oil prices go up , the retail gas tax can be abated			1
the oil security fee will make up for the revenue gap			0
when oil prices go down , the gas tax can be slowly reinstated			1
there is n't much that can be done about external events that affect global oil price volatility , but gas taxes can be designed to better manage abrupt price swings domestically			0
in short , the transportation system is a critical component of @entity11 's economy			1
the @entity11 can not be a superpower if it starves public investment in infrastructure			2
taxes tend to be more politically acceptable when people understand how funds provide benefits			0
and nobody understands better than travelers that the nation 's infrastructure needs serious improvements			0
it 's time to face the fact : the gas tax is a good way to invest in @entity11			1
opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity242 and @entity243 .			0

@entity245 and @entity243 : infrastructure suffers from *congressional* *inaction*
gas tax funds range of economy - bolstering transportation projects , they say
the gas tax is a good way to invest in @entity11 , they say
