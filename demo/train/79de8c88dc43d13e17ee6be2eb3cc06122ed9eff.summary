@entity0 -- the acting head of the @entity3 gingerly answered questions thursday about whether new full - body imaging machines will detect concealed explosives like that allegedly placed in the underwear of the @entity9			1
the deployment of 150 of those machines in front - line use at 11 @entity15 airports is to be announced friday by @entity17 secretary @entity16 , @entity3 officials say			1
" would this machine have detected a bomb on that person ? " rep. @entity21 , @entity22 , asked @entity23 , the agency 's acting administrator			2
" without going into the specifics of that because of the ongoing criminal investigation , i can tell you that the experience we 've had both in the labs and in our [ field tests ] , our officers are identifying objects on the body that are comparable to what that threat was , " @entity23 said			0
" every time ? " @entity21 asked			0
" our officers are doing a very good job , " @entity23 answered			0
" every time ? " @entity21 pressed			0
" i 'd have to get back to you , but you know we have very , very good measures in place for evaluating our officers , " she said			0
after several unrelated questions , @entity21 asked one more question about the machine 's capabilities			0
" is this machine the end - all ? " he asked			2
" this machine gives us an increased detection capability that is significantly greater than what we have at the checkpoint today , " she said , adding that her agency is " driving the manufacturers " to improve the technology			0
@entity23 testified that the full - body imagers -- which see through clothes , producing a ghostly image of a traveler 's body -- will not reveal objects hidden in body cavities			2
but she said imagers are better at detecting concealed items than a pat down			1
" today , we do not do a full - body pat down that goes into the sensitive parts of the body where that [ christmas day bomb ] was secreted , " @entity23 said			0
on friday , @entity73 will announce the first deployment of whole - body imagers as a standard part of checkpoint equipment			1
though 40 machines have been deployed at 19 airports nationwide in field tests , friday 's announcement will mark the official beginning of the program , @entity3 officials said			1
the new machines will be deployed this weekend in @entity87 , @entity88 , and @entity89 , @entity90 , the agency said wednesday			2
it will reveal the remaining airports friday			0
the 150 new machines were purchased last fall with federal stimulus money			1
the agency hopes to deploy nearly 500 units by the end of the year			1
under existing protocols , full - body scans are optional at airport checkpoints			0
travelers who decline the scans are funneled to a location where they may be given a pat - down and subjected to other tests , such as swabs that can detect minute traces of explosives on hands or luggage			1
the @entity3 said most passengers prefer a body scan to a pat - down			1
but others have objected to the body scans , calling them electronic strip searches			0
@entity23 testified that the machines will not significantly slow the passenger screening process , saying it will be done at the same time as the carry - on baggage screening			2
the agency has spent years testing whole body imagers			2
plans to deploy them this year were given added urgency after the arrest of a @entity127 man , @entity9 , who was accused of attempted to detonate an explosive sewn into his underwear aboard a flight december 25 .			1
