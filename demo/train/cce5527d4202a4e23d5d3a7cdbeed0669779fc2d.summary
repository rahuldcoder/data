-- @entity1 is devouring his second steak of the day and the clock has barely nudged 2pm			1
those hefty slabs of meat make up a decent chunk of the 6,000 calories he is putting away daily in what has become an obsessive pursuit of distance			1
but this intense training regime is n't designed to support a weightlifting crusade or an endurance run , it is built around thrashing a golf ball further than anyone else in the world			1
" @entity19 obsessed , " coach @entity20 says , as his protege chomps down on fillet number two			0
" his whole life at the moment is built around finding an extra yard here or there			0
" if anyone embodies golf 's fixation with going further , faster it is @entity1			1
his specially crafted equipment , diet , gym workouts and coaching sessions are all based around him winning a battle of small margins against a legion of monster hitters			0
the 29 - year - old is homing in on his main target for 2014 , the long driving world championship in @entity45 , a title he won back in 2010			1
should the man currently ranked no. 1 in the world pitch the ball further than his competitors , prize money of $ 250,000 will be landing in his bank account			2
" it is all - consuming , especially at the moment , " the 29 - year - old told @entity0 after lunch at @entity56 , just north of @entity57			0
" you 're living it , you 're thinking about it , you 're searching for it			0
this is the @entity64 -- the big one			0
if you 're not going to prepare properly for it , then forget about it			0
" as i waited for @entity1 to arrive , the staff had spoken in reverential tones of his hitting prowess			1
" have you seen him swing yet ? " one asked			0
" @entity1 's longest drive in competition is a mammoth 474 yards			1
that 's the equivalent of hitting the ball ten yards shy of the antenna perched on top of the @entity80			1
it is 50 yards past the longest drive recorded on the @entity83 in 2014 -- 424 yards by two - time masters champion @entity84			1
the speed at which @entity1 swings the club regularly clocks in at 155 miles per hour and the ball consistently flies off the face at a freakish 225mph			1
in contrast , the club head speed of a distinctly amateur golfer ( me , for example ) is around 97mph , the ball taking off at a relatively pedestrian 145mph			0
its golf , but not as many people know it			2
not even the tour professionals			0
when @entity1 launches into his first drive on the range after a brief warm up , it is impossible to see the ball against the backdrop of a grey autumn sky			1
what is evident , though , is the power @entity1 possesses			1
his swing is a violent twisting of limbs , unleashing the club with the potency of a speeding freight train			0
@entity20 says instead of trying to pick up the ball using the line of trees at the back of the driving range , i have to watch it right off the club face or else i 'll have " no chance , such is the angle it takes off at			2
the next one i catch sight of immediately and focus on intently for the best part of 10 seconds until it comes to rest some 415 yards away			2
so how has @entity1 altered his swing in order to maximize distance ? " i could sit here and bore you for eight or nine hours , going through each tiny little move , " he laughs			1
" basically , you need the right technique and a lot of speed			0
" i always start off with teeing it higher -- i use a four inch tee			0
that is going to give us the right launch conditions			0
" then i take a wide stance , a longer swing and use tighter angles			0
we use our wrists a lot to create a lot of levers			0
" it 's the complete opposite of what you do for short or mid irons , or chipping , it 's trying to gather as much speed as you can and unleash it at that last second			2
" @entity1 's obsession with distance is one reflected at all levels of golf , he says			1
every single player on the planet would snap your hand off if they were offered an extra 20 - yards to add onto their drives and iron shots			2
that has helped foster a dynamic design culture among the game 's manufacturers , one that has helped grow the discipline of long driving enormously over the last five years			1
@entity1 's specialist drivers are made with two degrees of loft ( regular tour players use 9.5 degree drivers ) and have minimum flexibility in the shaft			1
they are also built to withstand ferocious hitting			1
" technology as it has progressed -- with shafts and the heads -- it plays a huge part , " @entity1 explains			1
" when you are swinging 150mph or over , clubs even three or four years ago , were n't designed to hold that			0
the heads were blowing up in two seconds			0
" the clubs now are a million times better			0
it was a learning curve for my sponsor , @entity196 , to produce something that 's got a flat face and has to withstand ball speeds coming off at 220mph			2
" there are clubs out there that ca n't do that and would blow up with one hit			0
the technology is going to get better once other companies are on board -- then there is a rivalry			0
it is always going to grow , just like the game			0
" i think it shows how long driving has progressed			1
when i came back to the @entity214 after winning the world championships in 2010 nobody , apart from the real fans of it , knew about it			1
" i had to come back and do something with it , i was going out and getting some exposure in magazines and the television			0
it 's been a steady incline			2
it 's paying dividends now -- people are noticing it			2
" it motivates me even more because people are recognizing the sport now			0
" @entity20 says there are up to 50 points of @entity1 's swing that have been tweaked from a regular tour pro 's to maximize the length he hits the ball			1
after studying over 100 long hitters they embarked on a process of trial and error , experimenting with different positions , swing techniques , hip and foot positions			2
" it 's been a learning curve for me and @entity20 , " he said			2
" he 's been teaching for over 20 years and it 's only now when you start looking at the bio mechanics of it and these tiny micro moves that are in a golf swing that you would n't see unless you have a trained eye			1
" it 's so fine , half a per cent here or there , whatever it is			2
whatever the pros are working you can times that by five , six , seven , maybe ten times			0
" when you are looking for those extra yards , all of a sudden you realize how much the body can change and how much is involved in that			2
" @entity1 's jet - propelled swing is backed up by numbers			1
propped up on the ground behind @entity1 is a @entity274 box that records all sorts of information from his swing			1
it is almost as if he and his coach are speaking a different language when analyzing the data -- angle of attack , flight plane , dynamic loft and spin ratios are all mentioned			0
it all boils down to this ; @entity1 needs to execute the perfect technical swing , and connect with the ball , not only right in the middle of the club , but also at the right angle , for it to fly			1
doing it under pressure , in front of a 5,000 strong crowd at the @entity298 world championships , is next on the agenda , as @entity1 aims to recapture his crown			1
" the crowd adds the adrenaline , " he admits			0
" if you get the crowd behind you , for me it plays a massive part			0
i could never replicate that here when you 've people shouting and screaming			0
" there 's only a limited crowd on show at @entity312 but we are still in awe of @entity1 's hitting prowess			1
and when i ( foolishly ) challenge him to a competition , his game face is on immediately			2
the brisk conditions do neither of us any favors , but i 'm content with my drive that lands 238 yards away and trickles to the 260 mark			1
it was cold , remember			0
the data shows my club head speed at a respectable 97mph , the ball coming off the face at a not slovenly 145 mph			0
unsurprisingly , @entity1 makes my effort look feeble -- his ball flies off the face at 208mph , hit by a club that was wielded towards impact at 144mph			1
his lands 112 yards past the distance where mine finished and eventually comes to rest 397 yards away -- over 30 yards longer than the height of the @entity337			2
still , there 's no disgrace in that			2
i play golf with some people who would struggle to hit it 397 yards in two shots .			1

@entity346 's @entity1 *gunning* to be crowned golf 's world long driving champion
@entity1 , who was champion in 2010 , has a longest competition drive of 474 yards
he eats an average 6,000 calories a day to maintain his ferocious hitting power
