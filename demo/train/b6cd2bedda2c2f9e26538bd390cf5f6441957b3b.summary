@entity0 -- it 's a moment for the ages			2
tens of thousands of @entity9 , dozens of presidents and prime ministers , celebrities and street sweepers are all heading to the same place : a stadium in @entity0 , where they 'll honor @entity13 at a memorial service on tuesday			1
with 91 heads of state attending , security will be tight			1
authorities are already stepping up surveillance as presidents of six nations prepare to pay tribute to the late anti-apartheid leader in a four - hour service that will likely bring much of @entity9 to a stop			0
working off plans developed for years in secret , the @entity9 government is using an elite military task force , sniper teams and canine teams to help secure the stadium , @entity1 's @entity26 reported monday			1
in addition , helicopters and military jets frequently fly overhead			0
" should anybody , anything dare to disturb or disrupt this period of mourning and finally taking and accompanying the former president to his last resting place , then that person will be dealt with , " brig			2
@entity9 officials wo n't give details about their security plans -- how many police officers , how many troops , precautions to keep the stadium weapons - and explosives - free			1
" but we can assure that all necessary steps have been taken , and that is why the leadership of the world and former leaders of the world have confidence to come to our country at this time to share with us this moment , " said @entity54 in the @entity55			0
the event promises to rival other significant state funerals in recent decades , such as that of former @entity68 prime minister @entity67 in 1965 and the 2005 funeral of @entity70 , which attracted some 2 million people to @entity72 -- among them four kings , five queens , at least 70 presidents and prime ministers and the leaders of 14 other faiths			1
at that event , metal detectors and some 15,000 members of security forces stood watch over the event			2
@entity86 official : @entity9 experienced at hosting crowds @entity86 officials are satisfied with security arrangements			2
" we have not heard any concerns , " deputy national security adviser @entity90 told reporters aboard @entity92 as president @entity93 flew to @entity9			0
" the @entity9 hosted the @entity95 , so they have experience hosting significant crowds and managing events like this , although clearly this is really a unique event in world history , given the number of leaders coming to pay their respects , as well as the people of @entity9			0
" given @entity13 's ailing health , the @entity106 made some arrangements in advance , a @entity106 spokesman said			1
but work that would usually take months to complete has been done in less than a week , the spokesman said			0
" it 's a compressed timeline , but there are certain protocols we must have in place for any trip , " the spokesman said			1
those protocols involve securing the president 's motorcade route and hotel rooms and doing security walk - throughs			1
the spokesman declined to offer specific details on security measures at the stadium			2
while tuesday 's memorial is the first major event honoring @entity13 since his death , it wo n't be the last			1
a state funeral will be held sunday in @entity13 's ancestral hometown of @entity131 in @entity9 's @entity132			1
send us your stories , memories and photographs of the @entity139 winner and former @entity9 president			0

@entity93 has cited @entity13 as his own inspiration for entering politics			2

crews worked overtime monday to prepare @entity165 in @entity0 for the service			0
the stadium , where @entity13 delivered his first major speech after his release from prison , can hold some 90,000 people , but that wo n't be enough to hold the hundreds of thousands clamoring to celebrate @entity13 's life			1
the government has set up overflow locations at stadiums and other facilities throughout the country			0
with private vehicles banned from the area around the stadium , the government pressed buses from around the country into service and stepped up train service to move the crowds			2
