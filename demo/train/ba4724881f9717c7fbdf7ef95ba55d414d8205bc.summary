wednesday was a dark day for the future of books			0
the @entity2 charged @entity3 and five large book publishers with conspiring to raise e-book prices			1
three of the five publishers quickly capitulated rather than face the risk and expense of a protracted legal battle			2
much of the case revolves around the decision of five of the largest six publishers to simultaneously adopt the agency pricing model immediately before @entity3 launched the @entity15 and @entity16 in april 2010			1
at that time , @entity17 commanded about 90 % of the e-book market			0
@entity17 priced many books at $ 9.99 -- which was below the cost at which @entity17 was paying the publisher -- in an effort to drive e-book adoption among consumers and capture market share			2
publishers balked at @entity17 's strategy out of concern that low prices could cannibalize their print sales , set unrealistic expectations in the minds of consumers , and lead @entity17 to demand e-book price concessions from publishers			1
when @entity37 offered @entity3 's proposed agency pricing model to publishers , large publishers welcomed @entity3 's market entry because they wanted a strong counterbalance to @entity17 's market dominance			1
under the agency model , publishers set the prices and retailers do n't discount			1
critics of the agency model viewed it as an attempt to raise e-book prices			1
they believe retailer discounting serves an important public service			0
while i 'm a big fan of discounting and price competition , i think the responsibility for pricing decisions should rest with authors and publishers			1
if they price fairly and competitively , customers will reward them			0
if they price too high , customers will migrate to lower - cost books			0
most important , the agency pricing model levels the playing field for e-book retailers			1
it prevents deep - pocketed retailers or device makers from engaging in predatory price wars to harm competitors or discourage formation of new competitors			2
it would enable the marketplace to support more retailers , which would mean more bookstores promoting the joys of reading to more readers			2
and it would force retailers to compete on customer experience rather than price			2
customers are best served when we have a vibrant e-book retailing ecosystem			0
for authors and publishers , the agency model provides them with greater control over the timing of their promotions and higher per - unit earnings of 70 % of the list price as opposed to 50 % for the conventional wholesale pricing model			1
it allows publishers to price their books lower -- to the benefit of customers -- and yet earn the same or greater profit			0
there 's already indication that some publishers and authors who use the agency model are dropping prices as they compete for customers			1
at my company , where we distribute over 100,000 e-books on behalf of 40,000 self - published authors and small publishers , the average price of our books is about $ 3.41 , a drop of 25 % over the last 18 months			1
if the @entity2 prevails with its antitrust lawsuit , the decision might have unintended negative consequences for those who write , publish , sell and enjoy e-books			1
the government 's intention to protect consumers could end up backfiring on consumers by harming retailers , authors and publishers			1
it could inadvertently hasten the downfall of the world 's largest book publishers by forcing them to comply with onerous conditions outlined in the @entity2 's @entity136			1
these conditions -- including restrictions on collaboration with fellow publishers and increased federal auditing and reporting requirements -- will increase publisher expenses and slow their business decisions at the very time when publishers need to become faster , nimbler competitors			1
i 'm not normally a defender of big publishers			0
they price their books too high , while most of their authors earn poverty wages			0
they take 12 to 18 months to publish a book -- an anachronism in today 's world of instant self - publishing			0
they often reject talented writers who do n't offer the celebrity platforms of more marketable " authors " such as @entity165 or @entity166			0
despite the mistakes of the largest publishers , i do n't want them to go away			0
i want them to thrive by becoming more responsive to their customers and authors			0
unfortunately , the self - inflicted wounds of large publishers have already begun to render their businesses less relevant to the future of publishing			0
authors are beginning to turn their backs on traditional publishers in favor of self - publishing			2
authors are now hiring their own editors , cover designers and marketing consultants			0
by assuming responsibility for the roles once played by publishers , authors are earning up to 70 % of the list price as their e-book royalty versus the 17.5 % paid by traditional publishers			2
they 're publishing low - cost e-books that are hitting all the bestseller lists			0
the all - important access to distribution -- once exclusively controlled by publishers -- is now available to all self - publishing authors			2
the next time you see an overpriced e-book , blame the publisher but not the agency pricing model .			1
