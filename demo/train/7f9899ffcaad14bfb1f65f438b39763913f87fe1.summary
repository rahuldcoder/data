@entity3 a crewless , powerless ship that drifted in the @entity1 with hundreds of migrants aboard has been towed to an @entity6 port			1
@entity7 , the harbormaster in @entity9 , said 360 migrants were found on the cargo ship @entity12 -- 74 under 18 years of age and four pregnant			1
the @entity14 arrived to greet the migrants leaving the ship			1
all of them appeared to be in good health and nobody was hospitalized or quarantined , he said			0
the migrants were being sent to reception facilities			2
authorities responded late thursday to a distress call from the @entity12 , @entity6 's coast guard said			1
it 's the second rescue of a crewless vessel off @entity6 's coast , in what appears to be a worrying new tactic by people traffickers who either abandon the ship or mix with the passengers			1
overnight , the @entity12 was at a standstill 58 miles ( 93 kilometers ) off the city of @entity36 in the @entity37 , the coast guard said , where rescuers were trying to restart the boat 's engines			1
the @entity43 coast guard said its vessel @entity46 towed the stranded ship to shore			1
the @entity49 was unable to dock at a nearer port because of the ship 's limited maneuverability , the coast guard said			1
the @entity49 was doing surveillance for @entity54 , the @entity56 border management agency , when it was called in to help			0
six @entity6 and four @entity43 coast guard crew members boarded the @entity59 , the @entity6 coast guard said			1
as well as taking control of the ship , they brought food and water for its passengers @entity66 : 3,000 died in 2014 trying to get to @entity67 the @entity6 air force and coast guard said that weather conditions had made the rescue operation very challenging , with coast guard crew members having to be taken by helicopter to the ship , which is flying the flag of @entity76			1
the alarm was raised when migrants launched an @entity79 , said @entity80 , a spokeswoman for the @entity6 coast guard			1
since last september , she told @entity4 , there have been 15 similar cargo ships carrying mainly migrants from @entity84 who are wealthier and can pay more than others who are forced to travel on smaller , rickety boats			1
she cited the @entity87 as saying the price for each passenger was about 6,000 euros ( $ 7,260 ) , with a reduction if there are more than 250 passengers on board			0
such cargo ships leave from a @entity96 or @entity97 port with the migrants already on board , she said			1
they are old merchant ships that " should not be navigating in the @entity1 , " she said , and still have a flag , as in the case of the @entity12 , or carry a fake flag			1
they sail in @entity97 or @entity96 waters without rousing suspicion and appear to be normal merchant ships , @entity80 said			2
however , once in @entity6 " save and rescue " operational waters , they launch a mayday via satellite phone to a humanitarian association or directly to the @entity6 coast guard , she said			1
the smugglers then either abandon ship or mix in with the migrants			1
only when all passengers are questioned on shore do investigators have a chance to identify the smugglers , @entity80 said			2
' multimillion - dollar business ' @entity54 spokeswoman @entity121 drew a parallel between what happened on the @entity124 and on the @entity125 , a freighter that was also apparently abandoned this week by its crew with almost 800 people aboard , most believed to be migrants from war - torn @entity84			2
it docked safely in the southern port of @entity133 on wednesday after the @entity6 coast guard seized control			1
in each case , human traffickers appear to have employed the same method of using large , decommissioned cargo ships that have been " brought back from the dead , " @entity121 said			1
it 's a " multimillion - dollar business " for those operating such ships , she said			2
@entity142 estimates that each passenger paid $ 3,000 to travel on the @entity12			1
while their work is focused on border control , @entity54 vessels -- provided by @entity56 member states -- are obliged to help in search - and - rescue situations , @entity121 said			0
with ever - increasing numbers of migrants from such countries as @entity84 and @entity154 putting their lives in the hands of unscrupulous traffickers , their efforts are sorely needed			2
faced with a crisis off its shores , @entity6 launched @entity161 ( " @entity162 " ) to try to find and rescue stranded migrants			2
it has now scaled back the project , which cost @entity6 9 million euros ( $ 10.9 million ) a month from november 2013 to the end of 2014			2
in october , the @entity56 announced that @entity54 would launch its own operation , dubbed @entity169 , in the central @entity1 to help fill the gap			0
@entity56 commissioner @entity171 , said the new @entity54 operation would " show concrete solidarity to @entity6 , by reinforcing its border surveillance and supporting its humanitarian efforts			0
" but , she said , " it is clear that the @entity169 operation can not and will not replace @entity162			0
" ships equipped with cells , quarantine areas while @entity183 is over in name , @entity6 naval assets are still carrying out rescues in cooperation with @entity54 vessels , which call them in to help			0
the @entity189 , a navy ship that was converted to rescue migrants under @entity162 and which was the primary rescue vehicle , is still active in such missions and was used last week to rescue those on board the burning @entity96 ferry , @entity196			2
it is equipped with an infirmary , jail cells for smugglers , quarantine sections for potential @entity203 patients , and sleeping quarters for the migrants			0
@entity4 went out last month on a @entity54 patrol on the @entity207 , a @entity209 fishing vessel converted into a @entity211 coast guard ship			1
@entity212 , commander of the @entity207 , said that the crew do see themselves as search and rescue			0
" we are not turning migrants back , we are rescuing them , " he said			2
report : 40,000 migrant deaths since 2000 dangerous sea routes amid continued migrant deaths at sea , rights group @entity221 warned last month that @entity169 was " vastly reduced in scale and area covered " compared with @entity183 and called on @entity56 nations to step up their efforts			0
" people are still taking these dangerous sea routes to get to @entity67			0
if the @entity56 is serious about preventing the @entity1 from becoming a cemetery , it must be prepared to deploy search - and - rescue operations all along the routes that desperate refugees and migrants are taking , " said @entity229 , @entity221 's director for @entity67 and @entity230			0
a spokeswoman for the @entity238 said friday that it was closely following the @entity12 situation			2
" the rescues of the @entity125 m two days ago and of the @entity124 show that smugglers are finding new ways to enter @entity56 territory , " she said			0
" to prevent such events and to protect the lives of migrants , fighting smuggling will continue to be a priority under the @entity238 's agenda for comprehensive migration in 2015			0
" more than 207,000 people crossed the @entity1 for @entity67 illegally in 2014 , the high commissioner for refugees , the @entity66 refugee agency , said last month -- almost three times the previous high of about 70,000 in 2011			0
that 's 60 % of roughly 348,000 boat migrants worldwide last year			0
" @entity67 , facing conflicts to its south ( @entity262 ) , east ( @entity263 ) and south - east ( @entity84 / @entity264 ) is seeing the largest number of sea arrivals , " the @entity258 said			0
more than 3,400 of those seeking to reach @entity67 last year died , many of them drowning after being trafficked in unseaworthy vessels from the shores of the @entity272 and @entity273 across the @entity1			0
journalists @entity274 and @entity276 reported from @entity3 and @entity277 wrote and reported from @entity278			0
@entity4 's @entity279 and @entity280 contributed to this report .			0

ships are being " brought back from the dead " to carry migrants , official says
