@entity0 , @entity1 -- most artistic directors ' first day leading a new ballet company is all about meeting the dancers			1
but for @entity8 it 's a challenge just to find the rehearsal room			1
the mazelike corridors of the magnificent @entity11 in @entity0 prove confusing and inspire a few unchoregraphed twists and turns from @entity13 before he finally identifies the right room and his new company -- the 140 dancers of the @entity18			0
it 's unlikely the theater 's floor plan will be the last challenge for the @entity24 choreographer who , this month , took over leadership of the company			1
he 's the first foreigner to lead a @entity1 ballet company in over a century and has been charged with bringing modern choreography to the @entity18 's classical repertoire			1
" having a look at the past but always stepping forward and stepping into the future ... this is what i think they want and that is why i think they called me , " said @entity8			2
" i think they have it pretty clear that they want to change ; that they want something new			0
" a modern ballet dancer and choreographer with an international pedigree , it is hoped he can revitalize the ballet for @entity1 audiences			1
while performances at the @entity18 are well attended , there 's a growing concern that @entity1 may become tired of seeing the standard repertoire of classical ballets			1
that goes without saying , but the attitude that exists towards @entity1 ballet in the @entity62 is more passionate , " said @entity56 , billionaire fruit importer and general director of the @entity11			1
" i would like that within @entity1 we would have the same attitude because as we say ' we do n't treat what we have until it 's gone			1
' i consider ballet to be a national treasure , " he added			0
@entity56 is a relatively recent convert to ballet but he has become something of a cultural entrepreneur , investing $ 45 million of his own money to restore the @entity18 's buildings and , hopefully , its reputation			2
@entity56 required fresh talent to oversee his vision and for that , he says , he had to look beyond @entity1			2
" i looked within our industry to see who were considered living legends of choreography , and when i looked within @entity1 , i realized that we did n't have choreographers who had the ability to not just choreograph , but also head the company , " he said			1
he approached @entity8 , a @entity87 speaker , who has spent the last 20 years choreographing new works as artistic director of the @entity90			1
at first @entity8 was reluctant to change direction towards classical ballet			1
but then @entity18 offered him the chance to bring modern choreography to a classical ballet company and it proved an offer too enticing to pass up			2
" i know many people who think he 's ( @entity56 ) crazy , that i 'm crazy and that this is never going to work , " said @entity8			1
" that this mixture is just like a bomb , an atomic bomb			0
but he made me feel that ' let 's try , let 's do it			0
why not ? maybe we can do it			0
' " bringing a modern approach to ballet in @entity1 , where it 's ingrained in the culture might daunt some , but it 's a task @entity8 is relishing			1
" it 's not a pressure			0
it really is a pleasure to be in a place where ballet ( has been ) part of the cultural tradition for ( such a ) long time , and at the same time they want to break through and do new things , " @entity8 said			2
@entity8 has set himself a challenging schedule , hand - picking three dancers to create a ballet so new it does n't even have a name yet			2
they have just weeks before the world premiere			1
principal dancer @entity131 is the jewel in the @entity18 's @entity134 crown			0
the company 's star ballerina has danced the principal roles in productions of classical ballets including " @entity140 , " " @entity141 " and " @entity142			2
" now , she 's relishing the chance to stretch her skills			0
" in this repertoire , i can show a different side of myself , express myself differently and find something new in me , " she said			0
opening night will be a litmus test of just how receptive @entity1 are to this new direction			0
@entity8 believes ballet is a living organism , which needs to evolve constantly in order to keep the audience interested			2
it 's a philosophy he shares with @entity56			0
" together we are going to work into something , " said @entity8			0
" we do n't know how it 's going to be but i think it 's going to be beautiful			0
if we put all our hearts and soul into it , it 's going to be something fantastic			0
