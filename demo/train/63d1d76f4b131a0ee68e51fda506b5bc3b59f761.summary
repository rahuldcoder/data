@entity0 and her business partner @entity1 were eating breakfast in a @entity4 bakery in @entity5 recently , each wearing @entity6 but actually immersed in their smartphones when they were accosted by an angry stranger			1
though they 'd only had the beta devices for about a month , they 'd become accustomed to curious people approaching them like they were minor celebrities , peppering them with questions about the still - rare technology , asking to try it on and even getting their pictures taken wearing it			1
but the man in the bakery did n't want a demonstration			0
he was interested in confrontation			0
he asked if they would be comfortable with him recording a video of the pair on his phone , violating their privacy and rights in the same way he felt they were violating his by wearing recording devices on their faces in public			1
" he said we were being very intrusive and invading his sense of privacy and was altogether quite upset that we were there wearing @entity6 , " @entity0 said			1
a different kind of backlash negative reactions to @entity6 have been making headlines lately			1
earlier this year , @entity42 entrepreneur @entity41 preemptively banned people from wearing @entity6 at his 5 @entity44 before the technology was even released			1
recently he made headlines again after a manager at another one of his restaurants , @entity46 , asked customer @entity50 to leave for refusing to remove his @entity6 while inside			1
the burgeoning dissent is sometimes not pretty			0
early adopters have been handed a less - than - flattering nickname in some circles : " @entity54			0
" a group calling itself stop the @entity56 offers free anti-glass icons and art on its site for businesses that want to notify customers the technology is not allowed			2
state and federal lawmakers have expressed privacy concerns about the technology and are , if you will , keeping an eye on it			1
even though @entity6 wearers claim these types of responses from businesses and individuals are not the norm , there is something different about the negative early reactions to @entity6 than what has greeted the smartphone and other new technologies in the past			1
while there may be some old fashioned technophobia at play , many of the criticisms come from members of a tech - savvy generation that embraces smartphones and tablets			2
@entity46 even encourages patrons to post photos taken at the business to @entity95 and tag them # @entity97 , according to @entity98			0
so what is it about @entity6 that elicits such different reactions ? " people make a personal decision to check their smartphone or log in and check their social media accounts , but @entity6 is out of their control , " said @entity102 , a psychologist who focuses on technology			1
" they are not able to make a decision as to whether they want to be ' on ' or ' connected ' through someone else 's process , and they are concerned and unhappy that they do not have a say in the matter			0
" people feel in control when using their own technology but , fairly or not , @entity6 seems to them more like invasive surveillance			1
" for the most part they have given up privacy gladly to be connected through all possible modalities			2
however , that is when the choice is their choice			0
this is not , " @entity102 said			0
" this is someone else essentially eavesdropping on their lives , and if they want to give up their own privacy , they seem to want to do it on their terms and their timeline , not someone else 's			2
" easing fears with education the technological differences between smartphones and @entity6 are minimal			1
both have cameras that can record videos and audio and take photographs			2
both can instantly upload recorded information to social media sites and other locations including @entity153 services			0
one of the primary concerns people have about @entity6 is that it is difficult to tell when the device is recording you			1
with a phone , a stranger would have to physically hold up the device and point the camera in the subject 's direction , a visible cue that they are recording			0
wearable cameras like @entity6 are always pointed and ready to go			1
because there are still so few @entity6 units in the wild , many people do n't fully grasp the device 's limitations , according to @entity1			1
some have the misconception that @entity6 is constantly recording video , but leaving @entity6 in record mode would kill the battery in about an hour			1
there is no external indicator light to show when @entity6 is in recording mode , but the screen is actually a transparent cube of glass , and people who are in close proximity can see a light when the system is on			1
" it 's very easy to identify whether the screen is on or off if you know what to look for , " @entity0 said			0
( both her and @entity1 's devices were turned off during the bakery incident , they say			0
) like picking up a phone and pointing , there are physical indicators that might give away the fact that someone is recording			0
to take a photo or start recording a video with @entity6 , the wearer has to speak to or touch the device			2
@entity1 and @entity205 think it 's actually easier to secretly record someone with a smartphone because they are far more ubiquitous and someone can just pretend they 're holding it up to read a web page , check @entity214 or send a text			0
" the phone , in my opinion , is a lot more of an invasion - of - privacy device than @entity6 because you can actually tell when somebody tries to use @entity6 , " @entity0 said			1
navigating the future stop the @entity56 is also concerned with the collection of big data through tools like @entity6			2
massive amounts of data can be automatically uploaded from wearable tech and phones to @entity153 services , social media or other cloud - based storage			0
@entity233 currently has facial recognition technology but has not yet tied it into @entity6			2
" the issue ... is not the device itself but rather ownership and control over the data , and power relations and social norms around surveillance and control , " the organization says on its about page			0
legally , @entity6 users have the same rights as photographers when it comes to recording and photographing in public			1
you can photograph anything in plain view , including strangers , while in public places			0
because video recordings include audio , the @entity257 points out that state wiretapping laws might make some video recordings illegal			0
when it comes to private property , the property owner has the right to prohibit photography in their home or business , typically by posting rules or asking people taking pictures to leave the premises			0
@entity1 thinks the restaurants instituting bans are just looking for free press coverage , but there are many bans on glass based on practical concerns			0
a woman who was pulled over for speeding in @entity282 was also ticketed for wearing @entity6 while driving , the device classified as a distraction much like a smartphone or other monitor			2
@entity287 is considering explicitly banning @entity6 behind the wheel			2
many casinos have banned wearable computer screens which they fear could be used to cheat or count cards , and some theaters worried about piracy have added @entity6 to the list of recording devices prohibited for audience members			1
wearable technology like @entity6 is still in its early stages			1
the companies producing the gadgets hope they 'll be seen as normal and become accepted in the same way smartphones are			0
until then , early adopters like @entity302 will have to handle the attention , both positive and negative .			0

@entity6 users have faced some negative reactions from businesses and strangers
most people are curious , but many have privacy concerns about the wearable devices
though they both have cameras , the reaction to @entity6 is different than smartphones
