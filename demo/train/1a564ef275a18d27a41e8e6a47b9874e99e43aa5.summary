the @entity47 did n't immediately respond to @entity54 's request for comment			0
authorities have not divulged details of the case against @entity2 , but photos obtained by @entity62 allegedly show @entity2 's son 's leg covered in marks , some of which appeared to have broken the skin			2

the crime is punishable by up to two years in a state jail and a $ 1,000 fine			0
@entity25 has said his client never meant to harm the boy and was simply doling out discipline much like " he experienced as a child growing up in @entity1			0
" @entity2 likewise defended himself , saying he is " not a perfect parent , but i am , without a doubt , not a child abuser			0
