@entity2 , @entity3 -- " stop the car , stop the car ! there 's a bull elephant in the road ! " words i listen to closely as they 're being shouted by a man sitting next to me clutching an @entity12			1
his name is @entity15 , a park ranger protecting myself and the @entity4 crew as we venture through the @entity18 in @entity3 for " @entity19			1
" we jump out of the car , cameras rolling ; he tells me villagers nearby have complained of a rogue male elephant storming through , damaging crops -- this may be him			2
just 25 meters separate us and the elephant 's enormous tusks			1
the magnificent animal stands defiantly at approximately three meters tall or more			0
it sees us but refuses to move , instead continuing to pull down branches , eat leaves and take his time			0
we do n't know how long he will remain calm and we certainly wo n't challenge or disturb him , so we find another way out			0
discovering the real @entity3 it was an incredible stroke of luck to find a peaceful bull elephant and get so close , especially since we were leaving after many fruitful hours of a walking safari			1
this park is part of a @entity42 that includes @entity2 , so the semi-wild animals here are protected by armed rangers like @entity15			1
he walked with me as we discovered beautifully striped zebras and stood in front of me as three dozen buffalo caught our scent and moved aggressively our way			0
@entity15 then took me to a distant part of the of park to show me something the rangers are extremely proud of ; their white rhinos			1
as we approach their grazing area , stepping over bushes , pushing branches aside , i could feel my heart racing			0
then , all of a sudden , quietly and without ceremony , two rhinos appeared ; a mother and her 12 - month - old baby			2
they 're shorter than i expect but much wider too , mud drying on their rough skin after a hot summer 's day			2
the ranger tells me the mother , they 've named " @entity72 , " was brought here from @entity74 , where poachers are pushing one type of white rhino to extinction			2
they 're here in an effort to reintroduce the animals to natural surroundings and hopefully increase their numbers			1
it 's a surreal feeling to be quietly occupying the same shaded space as such important creatures			2
dramatic elephant rescue now i understand why the rangers are gushing over " @entity90 , " the baby			2
it 's the first of its kind born at the @entity18 and represents a @entity3 success story			1
it also shows the extent to which locals truly care about preserving the natural wonders that surround them			0
i saw the same level of appreciation along the banks of the mighty @entity104 , meeting @entity3 who literally live and work in the " mist that thunders			1
" i approach one woman among a group of families enjoying the cool waters ; her name is @entity113 and she is all smiles			0
her baby is also called @entity90 and is staring at me curiously , peeking over @entity113 's shoulder			2
meeting two babies called @entity90 , it strikes me how optimistic @entity3 are about the future			1
i discover that @entity113 and @entity90 are from northern @entity3 , making their first trip to @entity2 together			1
she tells me it 's a privilege to be able to come down to @entity2 , bask in the waters and socialize with the other parents			2
elsewhere , i meet a group of young men , snapping pictures of the massive waterfalls with their small cell phones			0
while talking with them i find that they 're construction workers building a brand new ticketing office on the @entity3 side of the main bridge over the @entity104			1
this is their after - work stroll along what 's described as the most magnificent waterfall in the world			0
see @entity141 bungee jump at @entity2 the men live in camping tents while working on the new building yet seem proud of their situation			0
one even tells me @entity3 are " blessed people " and therefore it 's their responsibility to maintain the natural attractions			1
it was n't a salesperson 's pitch , or a canned , prepared response , it was genuine expression of appreciation that people from all corners of the globe come to their home			0
at this point i realize the encounters with wildlife were sublime but it was listening to people and their stories that really resonated with me			0
hours walking with @entity15 the ranger , moments chatting along the @entity104 with @entity113 and her baby and talking to what seemed to be sensitive construction workers			0
they all represent typical @entity3 in some way , and i can not get over the fact that my job is to meet these kinds of people all over the @entity181 continent			1
my thrilling time here has come to an end , and next i 'll take you to @entity186 in @entity187 , @entity74			0
my journey of discovery " @entity19 " continues ...			0
