-- @entity1 on thursday released its latest candy - themed mobile operating system : android 4.4 , more deliciously known as @entity3			1
the system will launch immediately on @entity1 's new nexus 5 phone and then roll out to other @entity7 devices , the @entity8 and @entity9 , in the next few weeks			1
nexus devices are @entity1 's flagship line of phones and tablets , running the newest and purest form of @entity15 and available without contracts			1
the @entity17 5 , manufactured by @entity18 , is built to work internationally on a variety of bands and with whatever local sim card you pick up , though @entity24 's band is still not supported			1
physically , the 5 - inch @entity17 is a bit thinner and lighter than the previous generation , while packing a faster @entity28 processor			2
it has optical image stabilization and a new @entity32 camera feature for combining multiple exposures into a single photo , lightening up dark areas and bringing details back to images blown out by a flash			0
the @entity17 is available online today in 10 countries and will be available in retail stores like @entity41			2
it 's a wider rollout than for previous generations of @entity17 phones			1
the 16 gb version will cost $ 349 without a contract and the 32 gb version will go for $ 399 , also without a contract			0
the phone also will be the first to have the new @entity3 features , many of which attempt to break down the walls between web , search , apps and communication tools			1
the phone app -- widely neglected since @entity15 smartphones first came out -- gets more search power in @entity3 , pulling in search results for business as well as your usual roster of contacts			1
incoming calls from business are recognized automatically in caller @entity66 , while pulling data from the same database that powers @entity69			0
@entity3 also adds support for third - party cloud services like @entity74 so you can see files stored on the device and in the cloud			2
@entity79 absorbs @entity81 and @entity82 messages , so your chats , video calls and texts are all together in one place			0
@entity1 now , the company 's app for serving up answers to questions you have n't even asked yet , is adding new categories			0
it can deduce your interests based on your web searches -- say , " @entity95 , " or corgis -- and add a card to @entity98 with the latest information about those interests			0
if there 's a specific site you check a lot that is only sporadically updated , @entity98 might alert you to new posts when they happen			0
it 's also tapping the power of crowds			0
@entity98 knows your location , and @entity1 knows what people at that exact spot during that time are most likely to search			1
for example , someone standing in front of @entity116 at @entity117 might search for a schedule of when the geyser is going to erupt			0
@entity98 will automatically show you the times without your searching			0
@entity122 on @entity3 is not limited to content from the web			0
@entity1 is starting to index content deep inside of individual apps , so if you search for a recipe it might show a web page and a link to a cooking app you already have installed			2
for now , it will only work with installed apps , but @entity1 says its working on adding support for apps in the @entity136 store , which could be a clever way to sell more apps			2
@entity3 is also @entity1 's attempt to address one the bigger problems plaguing @entity15 : @entity142 fragmentation			1
low - end @entity15 devices are big sellers in emerging markets like @entity146 and @entity147 , but because of their limited memories and pokey processors , they typically run older versions of the @entity15 operating system , like @entity152			1
the decision of what version of @entity15 to ship on these devices is up the manufacturers			0
but @entity1 is trying hard to make its newest os more appealing for these markets by upgrading it to use less processor power and memory .			1

@entity1 is rolling out its new @entity15 mobile operating system , called @entity3
the os will make its debut on new @entity17 smartphone , which went on sale thursday
@entity3 adds new search and @entity98 features and is *optimized* to work on *slower* phones
