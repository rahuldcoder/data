-- @entity1 is helping young military widows find the emotional support they need			1
@entity4 was just 21 years old when her husband , an @entity7 corporal , was killed in @entity8			2
four months after his death , she created the @entity1			2
the nonprofit has connected more than 900 young military widows through the @entity14 and weekend retreats since 2007			1
@entity0 asked @entity4 for her thoughts on being chosen as one of the top 10 @entity18 of 2011			1
@entity0 : where were you when you got the call that you 'd been selected as a top 10 @entity18 ? @entity1 : i was getting everything ready for an @entity1 retreat in @entity25 , @entity26			1
widows were arriving as i was on the phone			0
words truly can not describe what this means to me , my fellow widows , our husbands and all the healing and camaraderie that will come from this amazing platform and honor			0
the ( hero ) title , though , should be heroes , as it is a title that encompasses not only my life , love and dedication , but that of every widow that is a part of the @entity1 and each of the heroes whose lives and legacies they carry on			2
@entity0 : what do you hope this recognition will mean to the @entity1 ? @entity4 : this means that more widows will know they are not alone			1
it may seem like a simple statement , but more than 3,000 widows had their lives changed with two men at their door			0
after they get that news , the real struggles start			0
and that 's where the @entity1 comes in			2
@entity0 : how will you use the $ 50,000 award that you receive for being selected as a top 10 @entity18 ? @entity4 : it will be an integral part in helping facilitate the daily running of the @entity1 , but most importantly it will go toward our events for the widows throughout the country			1
we cover all costs for their time with us , so the only thing they need to worry about is healing and connecting with their fellow widows			0
with nine to 10 events held nationally throughout the year -- with hopes to do more -- these are a major aspect of the organization and connecting this generation 's widows			2
this money will truly go toward not only saving lives , but the legacies of our nation 's heroes			0
@entity0 : what do you want people to know most about your work ? @entity4 : the wounds from those affected by these conflicts , many can be seen with the naked eye			0
for this generation 's military widows and widowers , their wounds ca n't be seen ( even ) though they are some of the most severe			1
it is due to that fact that most of those suffering from the most major of losses do n't receive the support and compassion they so deeply deserve			0
the work the @entity1 does recognizes their sacrifice , survival and perseverance and allows them to find healing in a title they never thought they 'd hold			0
