the sleeping giant has awoken : latinos not only helped @entity2 win in key battleground states , but they made up 10 % of the electorate for the first time ever			1
latinos , the fastest growing minority , making up 16 % of the nation 's population , made their mark on election night as they voted for president @entity2 over @entity13 @entity12 71 % to 27 % , a lower percentage than @entity13 candidates have received in in the last three elections			1
at 27 % this year , @entity12 's @entity18 support is dramatically lower than former president @entity20 's support in 2004 , which was 44 % , and @entity23 sen. @entity22 's 31 % in 2008 , according to exit polls			1
the lowest percentage of latino voters won by a @entity13 was in 1996 , when @entity27 garnered only 21 % of @entity6 compared with then - president @entity28 's record 72 %			1
in 2008 , @entity2 received 67 % of the @entity18 vote			1
latinos made up 9 % of the electorate in 2008 with 19.5 million people eligible to vote			1
today , there are nearly 24 million hispanics eligible to vote			0
the number of registered @entity6 has increased by 26 % in the last four years to 12.2 million , according a report by the @entity36			2
" it 's something we saw coming and have seen happen for a numbers of years now			0
@entity18 are increasing their share of their electorate , " said @entity40 , associate director of the @entity41			2
" that number has been growing for a number of election cycles , and it 's going to continue to grow moving forward			0
" what might have swayed @entity6 to vote for @entity2 more than anything else ? @entity13 sen. @entity49 of @entity50 says the @entity13 was never able to connect with them			1
" the conservative movement should have particular appeal to people in minority and immigrant communities who are trying to make it , and @entity13 need to work harder than ever to communicate our beliefs to them , " @entity49 said in a statement on @entity53			0
@entity63 political strategist and commentator for @entity66 @entity65 said on @entity68 's @entity67 , " you can have engagement , but if you have no solutions on immigration , people who are concerned about those issues are not going to support you			0
" outreach and the message to the @entity18 community will be vital			0
in an originally off - the - record interview with the @entity80 in october , the president was " confident about immigration reform in the second term			0
" " and since this is off the record , i will just be very blunt , " @entity2 said in a transcript of the interview posted by the paper			0
" should i win a second term , a big reason i will win a second term is because the @entity13 nominee and the @entity13 have so alienated the fastest - growing demographic group in the country , the @entity18 community			2
" hispanics were vital in helping the president win in two of the key battleground states , @entity99 ( 70 % to 25 % ) and @entity100 ( 75 % to 23 % ) , and put @entity2 in the lead in @entity50 , where the vote still has n't been decided , according to exit polls			1
in @entity99 , the president won six electoral votes and nine in @entity100			0
@entity2 's popularity with @entity18 voters in @entity50 is credited to the growth in the @entity111 population in central @entity112 all @entity6 in @entity50 , 34 % are @entity113 and 57 % are @entity114 , according to the @entity41			1
" if we do n't do better with @entity18 , we 'll be out of the @entity119 forever , " said @entity13 strategist and @entity68 contributor @entity115 , who was the national @entity18 co-chair of @entity22 's presidential campaign			1
@entity120 of @entity121 moved to @entity122 just in time for the 2008 elections , but she did n't vote until this year			2
" i had just come to the @entity124 and still did not quite understand how to work the election process in this country			0
i felt misinformed regarding the difference between political parties , " @entity120 said			0
" @entity2 seemed like an excellent candidate , however , it was not until the most recent elections that i became active in @entity124 politics and issues affecting the @entity18 community			1
" @entity41 's analysis of exit poll data stated that 77 % of @entity18 voters said undocumented immigrants should be offered a chance to apply for legal status , while 18 % said such immigrants should be deported			2
among all voters , fewer than two thirds ( 65 % ) said these immigrants should be offered a chance to apply for legal status , while 28 % say they should be deported			0
" when @entity12 brought on @entity150 as his adviser for his campaign , that really made an impact on the @entity18 community , " said @entity146 , a campaign surrogate for the @entity148 to re-elect president @entity2			1
@entity146 started volunteering in march 2011 and provided guidance on @entity18 affairs and outreach in @entity158 for the campaign			0
latinos only make up 3 % of the swing state 's population , according to the @entity41 , of which @entity2 received 53 % of the @entity18 vote			1
" the @entity13 drove @entity6 away with their @entity165 agenda in being very vocal on ' self - deportation ' , " said @entity146			0
" it did n't help that @entity12 said the @entity23 immigration law was the model for the nation			2
" @entity12 said he only supported the @entity173 portion of the controversial @entity23 immigration law , also known as @entity175			0
after he made that statement , his opponents were able to characterize his support as being for the entire law , and that alienated many @entity18 voters			2
however , @entity18 voters might have made up their minds in 2011 , when @entity12 stated he would veto the @entity184 , but his reluctance during the second presidential debate to provide specifics on an alternative approach on immigration reform could have sealed the deal for most latinos			1
@entity12 said that he would offer a path to undocumented immigrants serving in the military but did not give details as to what he would do for the remainder of the 1.4 million undocumented immigrants who would qualify for citizenship under @entity2 's plan , which allows undocumented immigrants who came to the @entity124 as children to apply for legal status			2
while some @entity18 voters were disappointed with @entity2 's failure to achieve comprehensive immigration reform , which he considered his " biggest failure , " he said it was n't " for a lack of trying or desire , " during a @entity210 forum in september			1
however , that does n't relieve the pressure many @entity6 have put upon the newly re-elected president			0
" my hope for @entity2 as a woman , as a @entity18 , as a @entity111 , is that he keeps his word and all the promises he has made to us , " stressed @entity120			1
" i hope he conserves his integrity , prevails in government , and that he puts the people as priority over economic interests , political or partisan			0

latino vote helped @entity2 win in battleground states , made up 10 % of electorate for first time
@entity232 : " if we do n't do better with @entity18 , we 'll be out of the @entity119 forever "
