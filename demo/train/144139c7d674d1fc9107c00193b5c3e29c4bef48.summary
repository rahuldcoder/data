no one was killed and everyone was accounted for one day after the accident			1
" i do n't speak for anybody 's religious beliefs , but the mayor and i both agreed that if you want to define a miracle , what happened here yesterday meets that definition for me , " adm. @entity14 , the four - star head of the @entity15 , told reporters			1
he said the @entity4 is investigating the crash , but noted it will take weeks to determine exactly what happened			1

we will get everything down			2
we will examine it carefully , " he said			2
" we 'll fix whatever went wrong			0

" @entity1 gov. @entity43 thanked those who acted in an hour of need			0
" this amazing news follows the countless acts of bravery and selflessness that we witnessed yesterday , " he said in a statement			0
he said the crash response highlighted the character of the @entity4 , safety officials and the people of @entity1			1
" we saw neighbors rushing to the assistance of neighbors , the @entity4 pilots waiting until the very last second to eject , citizens pulling the pilots to safety and treating them , and a successful and efficient coordinated response from first responders , the city and others , " @entity43 said			1
" it was the very best of @entity1 on display			0
" among those who sprung into action was an off - duty @entity73 member			1
petty officer 2nd class @entity74 was at a friend 's house having lunch when the jet went down , according to a statement from the @entity73			1
" my training kicked in , " @entity74 said			0
" i saw the fire and explosion , and i knew i had to help			0
" he ran to nearby buildings and knocked on doors to make sure everyone was outside			0

his own safety was the last thing on his mind			0
" the fighter jet experienced a " catastrophic mechanical malfunction " during takeoff friday , raining jet fuel over @entity0 before plunging to the ground , damaging five apartment buildings , according to residents and @entity4 officials			1
the jet carried a student pilot in the front seat and an experienced instructor behind him , and the leakage of jet fuel was " one of the indications that there was a mechanical malfunction , " navy capt. @entity111 told reporters			2
the two - seat @entity124 jet landed eerily upright in flames in a courtyard surrounded by the five apartment buildings that were suddenly set afire			1
@entity128 : watch and hear jet fuel burning once the buildings were doused with water and the courtyard was coated with a foam , rescue crews began a detailed search through the charred hulks to look for any residents injured or killed , a fire official said			1

it crashed 2.2 miles from the runway , a senior @entity156 official told @entity2			0
eyewitnesses and residents described their community -- so accustomed to military planes taking off near their homes -- suddenly taking a surreal turn for the worse when the jet fell out of the sky and spewed its fuel , a possible maneuver to minimize the inevitable fire upon crashing			2
one ejection seat shell ripped through an oak tree and crashed into a condo fence , and the other seat shell landed next door , suggesting that the two @entity4 pilots ejected at a low altitude , said resident @entity176			2
@entity177 told @entity2 affiliate @entity178 that he was in his bathroom when he felt his " whole house shaking			0
