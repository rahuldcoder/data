-- former @entity2 mayor @entity1 plans to spend $ 50 million of his own money to build a state - by - state grass - roots network focused on stemming the tide of gun violence by expanding the background check system for gun buyers			1
his new organization , @entity10 for @entity11 , will bring together @entity12 and @entity13 in @entity14 , two gun control groups he already funds			1
@entity10 for @entity11 will focus on 15 states because , @entity20 says , we 've got to work at gun control " piece by piece			1
" there 's no disputing that gun violence in @entity14 needs to be tackled			1
@entity20 is making a sizable investment , $ 30 million more than what the @entity28 -- the largest @entity14 lobby group for gun rights -- spent in the 2012 election cycle			1
but there are two problems			2
first , do we want mega-rich individuals to influence public policy or sway voters with their wealth ? and , second , just as we need a federal immigration policy instead of piecemeal state legislation , do n't we need a federal gun control policy ? i grew up in a family that owned guns			1
my father was a homicide detective and a member of the police department 's swat team			0
he was also a hunter , as was my maternal grandfather			0
my stepfather , as a member of the @entity51 , was well - trained in firearms			0
as a child , i was taught the basics of gun safety , and i often accompanied one of these men when they honed their hunting skills through target practice or skeet shooting			1
even though i was familiar with guns , they scared me , and i often worried that my father would be fatally shot by a criminal			0
this worry ended when he retired from the police force , but my fear of guns persisted			0
the recent fatal shootings at @entity70 and the @entity71 in @entity72 have again brought my gun fears to the surface			1
i do not welcome the fears , but i do appreciate how the shootings have renewed the debate about gun control in @entity79			1
perhaps @entity20 's new gun control group will fuel the debate further			2
@entity20 is n't the only one who cares about this issue , but he may be the most prominent			0
we need more big voices to get involved in solving the problem of senseless gun violence in @entity14			1
but we also need to get some basic facts straight			0
the @entity90 reports that an average of 86 people are killed by guns every day in the @entity14			0
the @entity94 report that between 2000 and 2010 , more than 300,000 people died from guns			0
-- guns are the most common weapon used in murders and manslaughters			0
handguns comprised 72.5 % of the firearms used in murder and non-negligent manslaughter incidents in 2011 : 4.1 % were with shotguns , 3.8 % were with rifles , 18.5 % were with unspecified firearms			0
-- children are often victims of gun violence			1
eighty - two children under 5 years old died from firearms in 2010 , and half of all juveniles killed in the same year were killed with a gun			2
as reported by the @entity116 , nearly three times more children were injured by firearms in 2010 than the number of @entity14 soldiers wounded in action the same year in the war in @entity122			0
-- guns kill young @entity126 - @entity125 men more than anything else			0
in deaths of 15 - to 24 - year - olds , firearms homicide rates in the @entity14 are about 43 times higher than in other developed countries , and for young @entity125 men ages 15 - 24 , it 's the leading cause of death			0
for african - american male youth , firearms homicides surpass unintentional injuries , cancer , @entity139 and other diseases combined			0
of course , gun rights advocates often point out that people do n't need guns to kill			1
they can use other weapons such as knives			2
this is true , but in practice people are nowhere near as likely to get killed with a knife			0
in @entity14 , of 14,022 homicides in 2011 , 11,101 were committed with firearms			0
the rate of fatality is nearly four times higher when someone uses a gun rather than a knife to assault another person			1
stronger background screenings of potential gun owners would be a good start to curtailing firearm deaths			1
a study to be published in a forthcoming issue of @entity165 shows that when @entity166 repealed a handgun law in 2007 that required all handgun purchasers to verify that they had passed a background check , the murder rate increased by 16 % , adding 55 to 63 murders per year			2
even before the results of the study were released , many @entity14 -- including most gun owners -- supported universal background checks			1
that 's just one reason for @entity179 to pick up the issue of gun control again			2
another is that since the shootings at @entity185 in @entity186 , @entity187 , which was the last time there was a serious debate about gun control , there have been 44 more school shootings and 28 deaths			2
now that the debate has again been sparked , let 's try to find ways that would both preserve individual rights and make guns less responsible for deaths			1
a common sense approach is offered in the 2013 book " @entity201 in @entity14 : informing policy with @entity203 " by @entity204 and @entity205 , with a forward by @entity1			1
we should strengthen background checks , ban assault weapons and magazines that fire more than 10 rounds , and fund research on what actually works to end gun violence			1
if you agree , please follow something my father , an avid gun lover , liked to say : we need to make it tough to get guns because too many careless people use them to end petty arguments and squabbles			2
let 's not try to do it state by state			2
let 's take a stance as a nation .			0

@entity1 is spending $ 50 million to stem the tide of gun violence
@entity233 : we need a federal policy rather than piecemeal state legislation
she says we need to strengthen background checks and ban assault weapons
@entity233 : we must find a way to preserve individual rights and reduce gun violence
