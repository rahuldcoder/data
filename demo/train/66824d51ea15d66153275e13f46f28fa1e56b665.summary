-- " @entity5 " is the first of two @entity3 movies to hit theaters this week , the second being " @entity6 , " on christmas day			1
" @entity5 " is the obvious popcorn movie of the two , the crowd - pleaser : " @entity13 " to the other 's prestige - hungry " @entity10			1
" it 's also the better of the two -- a buoyant , breathlessly - paced motion capture animated adventure that puts the last " @entity19 " movie to shame			1
i grew up reading @entity22 © 's comic books about the escapades of the intrepid young reporter , his valiant fox terrier @entity26 , and their blundering ally @entity27			2
like " @entity30 , " " @entity5 " exists in a lost world of colonial exploration and adventure			1
his @entity35 creator , who signed himself @entity36 © , was 15 when @entity37 discovered @entity39 's tomb in 1922 , and 26 when @entity40 climbed the @entity41			2
his stories cling to the romance of those tall tales , real and imaginary			0
@entity5 had a knack for finding himself in the wrong place at the wrong time -- or the " right " place and time , depending on your point of view			2
where other reporters might have to dig out a story , mystery knocked on @entity5 's door -- introducing him to bizarre characters and whisking him to exotic locations in @entity58 , @entity59 , or ( once ) the @entity60			1
@entity3 jokily introduces his hero through a street artist 's quick sketch , before abandoning the familiar 2 - d cartoon for a new @entity65 , motion capture model			1
to my eyes there 's something disconcertingly creepy about the new look -- designed at @entity73 's @entity72 studios			2
still , you get used to it , and underneath his placid , plastic , doll - like surface it 's the same old @entity5 : a pale , round - faced young man with a tuft of marmalade hair perked on his forehead and a fondness for pants that come down to just an inch below the knee			1
no sooner has he picked up a model sailing ship at a flea market than he finds himself at the center of an intense bidding war for the self - same object			0
when he refuses to sell , the model is stolen from his home and a stranger is gunned down on his doorstep			0
hidden in the ship is one third of a treasure map			0
the dastardly @entity99 has his hands on a second section and means to piece the whole thing together , but he also needs the drunken sea captain @entity27 to help him decipher it			0
fortunately @entity5 helps the skipper escape @entity99 's clutches and then the race is one for the missing third , which is in the possession of an @entity109 sheikh with a fondness for opera			1
such antics might seem positively antiquarian , but the story moves at a good lick and @entity3 's touch is lighter than we 've seen in his live action movies for years			1
a shoot - out and chase in an old steamship is expertly handled , but the sequence moves up a gear when @entity5 and the permanently inebriated @entity27 are stranded in a rowboat , then another when they commandeer a sea plane that 's running out of fuel -- and the best is yet to come : a gravity - defying race through the @entity128 which bends physics with the glee you can only find in 3 - d animation			1
it 's delirious stuff , often laugh - out - loud funny , which is n't surprising with screenplay writers like @entity137 ( the writer behind the @entity140 's recent " dr who " and " @entity143 " revivals ) , @entity144 ( " @entity146 " ) and @entity145 ( " @entity147 " )			2
a running gag in which @entity26 is always a step ahead of his newshound pal is especially sweet			0
i might quibble about the voice casting			0
@entity154 's @entity5 is fine , but as fans will know , it 's the redoubtable dipsomaniac @entity27 who keeps the show ticking over			1
@entity159 may be the motion - capture king , but @entity27 's voice is n't near as robust and earthy as i used to hear it in my head			0
in fairness , my 6 - year - old did not share this concern			0
and it 's a pleasure to find a movie we both enjoyed as much as this one			0
the bar has been set			0
we 'll have to wait and see if @entity73 can match it in the next one .			0
