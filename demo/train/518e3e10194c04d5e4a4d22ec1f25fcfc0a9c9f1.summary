-- the media circus that is @entity2 ' murder trial is in its final stretch , as the jury began deliberations friday following closing arguments			1
the jury , which has been in court since january , will resume deliberations monday			1
it 's been an r - rated story , to say the least , with an abundance of testimony about grisly violence and , from @entity15 , details about a kinky sex life she says she shared with @entity19			1
the case has captured massive if not total interest among @entity22			2
while one part of the country watches @entity0 's sister network @entity25 for every twist in the trial , or drives hours to get one of the courtroom 's limited lottery seats ( yes , they 're doled out via lottery ) , another segment of the nation asks , " @entity34 who ? " for those of you in the latter category , here are some things you should know as the trial comes to a close : @entity2 lost in the salacious details of the " @entity2 trial " is the victim , @entity2 , 30 , who was brutally killed in his @entity48 , @entity49 , home in june 2008			1
@entity50 was an integral part of @entity19 's life			2
the professed son of methamphetamine addicts , @entity19 was raised in @entity55 , @entity56 , with three brothers and four sisters			2
his grandmother introduced him to @entity60 as a child			2
after he graduated from high school he went on a two - year mission in @entity64			1
he later moved to @entity48 because of the strong @entity66 community and became a motivational speaker and businessman			2
he also authored a book titled , " raising you			2
" @entity15 was living in @entity71 , @entity56 , when she met @entity19 at a business convention in @entity74 in september 2006			2
that november , he baptized @entity15 into the @entity66 faith , a ceremony @entity15 said was followed by anal sex			2
@entity15 became his girlfriend two months later , she testified			2
they broke up in the summer of 2007 , and @entity19 began dating other women			1
there were claims that @entity15 would stalk him , peering in his windows at times			1
still , he and @entity15 continued to hang out on several occasions until -- disenchanted @entity15 says -- she moved back to @entity56			2
the prosecution 's case @entity19 's naked body was found crammed in a stand - up shower after he missed two appointments , prompting friends to go to his house			1
he had been stabbed 27 times in the back and torso and shot in the head			2
his throat was slit from ear to ear			0
@entity15 initially told an investigator , " i heard a lot of rumors , and that there was a lot of blood			0
" she later claimed she killed him , albeit in self - defense			1
deputy @entity111 attorney @entity110 has accused @entity15 of playing the victim when , in fact , he alleges she staged the crime scene to make it look like self - defense and has actively sought to profit from the media attention			1
prior to @entity19 's killing , @entity110 said , @entity15 stole her grandparents ' .25 - caliber pistol , rented a car in @entity123 , @entity56 , turned off her cell phone and brought along cans of gas so there would be no record that she was in @entity49			1
" the only reason to keep this whole thing a secret , which is what she tried to do , is because she was going to kill him , and she 's making preparations , " the prosecutor said			0
finally , according to @entity110 's closing argument , after she killed @entity19 , she hooked up with an out - of - state romantic interest so she would have an alibi			1
" she continues on to @entity141 into his waiting arms			0
gosh , you can almost hear the violins making their sound as she goes up to him , gives him that first kiss			0
is n't that romantic ? " @entity110 said			0
@entity15 ' defense defense attorney @entity148 has said @entity15 was the victim of a controlling , psychologically abusive relationship and that @entity19 considered @entity15 " his dirty little secret			1
" before @entity15 killed her ex in self - defense , @entity148 claimed , she was subjected to rough vaginal sex			1
after she dropped @entity19 's new camera , he became violent , the defense said , and had @entity15 not defended herself , investigators would 've found @entity15 , not @entity19 , dead in the bathroom			1
arguing the prosecution 's position that @entity15 was obsessed with @entity19 and stalking him , another defense attorney , @entity160 , has said it did n't add up because @entity15 was active on a @entity66 dating site			1
" @entity34 ... was n't so locked in on @entity165 that she was n't looking for other men , " @entity160 said			0
as for the allegation that @entity15 attempted to surreptitiously slip in and out of @entity49 without a trace , @entity160 pointed out that @entity15 went to the @entity123 , @entity56 , airport to rent her car for the trip			0
" an airport with security cameras and security all around , " the defense attorney said , " not some rental car agency on the outskirts of town -- an airport			1
that does n't make any sense if you 're on a covert mission			0
" @entity160 also questioned the merit of the prosecution 's gas can argument , saying @entity15 could have avoided a paper trail simply by paying with cash			0
she did n't need cans , he said			0
did @entity15 change her story ? sure , @entity160 said , but that 's not what she 's standing trial for			1
" if @entity2 were accused of the crime of lying , i could not stand before you and say she 's not guilty of that crime , but nowhere in your jury instructions are you asked to convict @entity2 of lying , " @entity160 said			1
fascination if you did n't realize before , you probably see now why the case has drawn a cult following of sorts			0
it 's rife with sex , lies and digital images , many of them naughty , and the dueling attorneys are lively -- nay , bombastic -- in their arguments			0
@entity15 herself has been tweeting from jail -- through a proxy , of course -- criticizing @entity25 and @entity110 , and directing followers to a website that sells art on her behalf			0
for some media outlets , the case is gold			0
@entity25 has created a show , " @entity223 : the @entity2 , " which invites an in - studio and at - home audience to grade the day 's arguments			1
its website is flush with every facet of the case , including a photo gallery containing 180 evidence photos			0
the @entity233 has similar coverage , and @entity0 affiliates @entity235 and @entity237 in @entity238 have special trial pages on their websites			2
before you lob cries of a sensationalist media profiting off a gruesome death , realize that people are clamoring for the coverage			0
@entity25 has enjoyed a ratings boost since the trial began , and people drive hours to see the trial for themselves			1
spectators began lining up friday at 1 a.m. -- more than six hours before the courthouse opened -- to get a seat , according to @entity235			2
until april 25 , the public was given access on a first - come - first - served basis , but the judge changed it to a lottery system for closing arguments , the station reported			2
@entity260 of @entity238 was none too happy with the change , as he was first in line friday but did n't make the cut			0
" i just hope justice is served and that at least we get our $ 1.6 million worth with a conviction , " @entity260 told @entity235 , referring to the ever - increasing taxpayer expense on the trial			1
@entity270 of @entity271 , @entity272 , did n't have the luxury of a short drive across town			0
" it 's 10 hours nonstop , two times to fuel up			0
i did n't bring no extra gas cans , " @entity270 said , making a joke about a key argument in the case			0
potential outcomes what could happen to @entity15 is anyone 's guess			0
if the jury 's hung , she could face a retrial			0
the prosecution , naturally , would like to see a first - degree murder conviction , as its case has revolved around @entity15 premeditating the killing			1
if convicted on this charge , @entity15 will face a mini-trial of sorts to determine if she killed @entity19 cruelly and knew he would suffer			0
a first - degree murder conviction could mean execution unless a jury grants her leniency , in which case she would get life in prison and may not be eligible for parole for at least 25 years			1
if the prosecution ca n't prove premeditation , @entity15 could still be convicted of second - degree murder , commanding 10 to 22 years in prison			1
the jury can also decide that @entity15 killed @entity19 recklessly or that he attacked her			0
she 'd then be convicted of manslaughter			0
lastly , the jury could find her not guilty or determine that she acted in self - defense and that her actions were reasonable			1
either way , she 'd then be free to pursue her dream of becoming a professional photographer , and the media circus could move to another town .			0

@entity2 ' murder trial began in january
she is accused of murdering her *boyfriend* nearly five years *ago*
she claims she acted in self - defense
