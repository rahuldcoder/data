in a speech after the @entity3 shooting friday , president @entity0 asked @entity4 to pray , reflect and remember what 's important in life while the city of @entity8 mourned the dead and wounded			1
" if there 's anything to take away from this tragedy it 's the reminder that life is very fragile			0
our time here is limited and it is precious			0
and what matters at the end of the day is not the small things , it 's not the trivial things , which so often consume us and our daily lives , " @entity0 said in @entity20 , @entity21 , before returning to the @entity22			1
@entity0 on shooting : this is n't a day for politics but friday 's shootings are likely to propel the issue of gun rights and gun safety into the national conversation again , even though the president did not address it on friday and has largely avoided the subject while in office			1
@entity41 calls for unity after shooting @entity44 , senior attorney for the @entity45 , criticized @entity0 on friday for steering clear of the issue in office			1
for @entity49 , gun politics are bad politics " president @entity0 has refused to even talk about guns			1
in a speech today he did n't even say the word ' gun			0
' the closest he came was ' gunman , ' " @entity44 said			0
" unfortunately the president has shown a lack of leadership in standing up to the gun lobby			1
" talk of gun rights was largely absent from @entity0 's speech in the aftermath of the @entity65 shooting in 2009 and after then - rep. @entity66 and others were shot in @entity68 , @entity69 , last year			1
@entity0 mentioned gun safety only in passing after the @entity68 shootings to describe the polarizing nature of the issue			1
however , amid renewed discussions , the president penned an opinion piece two months after the @entity68 shootings that acknowledged the importance of the @entity78 and called for a " focus " on " effective steps that will actually keep those irresponsible , law - breaking few from getting their hands on a gun in the first place			2
" the president 's three - step plan included enforcing existing laws , rewarding states that provide the best data about gun owners and a better system for background checks			2
" clearly , there 's more we can do to prevent gun violence , " he wrote in the @entity94			0
" but i want this to at least be the beginning of a new discussion on how we can keep @entity4 safe for all our people			0
" but he did not go as far as he had on the campaign trail in 2008			0
as a candidate for president he adamantly declared he would not " take away your guns , " while supporting a platform that included reinstituting the assault weapons ban , stopping destruction of background check documents and closing the federal gun show loophole			2
" if you 've got a riffle , you got a shotgun , you 've got a gun in your house , i 'm not taking it away , " @entity0 said in @entity113 in september 2008 after stressing the importance of " common - sense gun safety measures			1
" gun safety advocates have expressed disappointment with the president 's actions since taking office , particularly over his failure to fight for the reinstatement of the assault weapons ban			2
they pointed out @entity0 signed bills into law that allowed loaded weapons in some national parks and on @entity134 trains and the destruction of background check documents			2
advocates at the @entity45 said the only step he took to support their cause was backing a rule requiring gun dealers who sell multiple rifles to individuals along the border with @entity145 to report the sales to law enforcement			0
@entity149 issues call to action on guns but they acknowledged their task is particularly difficult when the head of the @entity155 , @entity156 , repeatedly attacks the president for working against the @entity78			2
spokesman : @entity155 tweeter was ' unaware ' of @entity3 shooting " @entity0 has already signed on to destroy the @entity78 and our freedom , " @entity156 said at the @entity161 in february			2
" ( he has ) endorsed a total ban on manufacture , sale and possession of all handguns			0
" @entity22 spokespeople have been consistently vague when pressed on gun rights by members of the media			1
when asked friday if the president would take steps to curb gun violence in the form of gun safety laws after the @entity8 shootings , @entity22 press secretary @entity173 said , " the president believes that we need to take common - sense measures that protect @entity78 rights of @entity4 , while ensuring that those who should not have guns under existing law do not get them			1
" " there has been progress in that regard in terms of improving the volume of quality of information in background check , but i have nothing new , " @entity173 added			0
in july 2011 , @entity173 said the president directed attorney general @entity198 and state leaders to identify measures that would improve safety and protect @entity78 rights			2
" we expect to have some more specific announcements in the near future , " @entity173 said			0
but no announcements have been issued			0
gun rights continue to divide @entity4			1
a @entity208 survey released in april showed 49 % of @entity4 found it more important to protect the rights of @entity4 to own guns , while 45 % said it was more important to control gun ownership			0
the figures shifted when broken down by party ideology , race and sex			0
twenty - seven percent of @entity49 said it is more important to protect gun rights , while 72 % of @entity219 said the same			1
sixty percent of men found it more important to protect gun rights and 39 % of women found it more important to protect the rights of @entity4 to own guns			1
divides also exist among campaign contributions , according to filings with the @entity229 , which show an influx of cash disproportionately geared toward @entity219 candidates			0
in the 2012 cycle , presumptive @entity219 presidential @entity41 has received $ 126,440 from gun rights groups , compared to @entity0 's $ 2,300			1
that trend is consistent with the 2008 cycle , when sen. @entity238 collected $ 483,711 in such contributions and @entity0 received $ 25,987 .			0
