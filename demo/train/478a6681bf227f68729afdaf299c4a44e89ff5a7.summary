it was all a bit of an exaggeration , as she did worry a great deal about some of her more radical policies			0

" but it was @entity75 with whom she really solidified the transatlantic bridge			1
they fell out only once when she roasted him for not alerting her to the invasion of @entity104			0
he put her on speakerphone in the @entity106 and let her blast away , before telling her that he had been warned not to alert her because her @entity108 leaked so badly			0
he could not risk @entity76 lives just for the sake of briefing a friend , however close			1
it was of course the steadfastness of the president , the pope , and the prime minister which brought down that wall and destroyed the evil empire without a shot being fired			2
