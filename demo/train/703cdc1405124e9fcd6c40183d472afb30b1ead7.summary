-- our failure to give women in certain parts of the world the ability to decide the timing and number of their children is deeply damaging -- not just for the women themselves but for societies , too			1
lifting the obstacles is not something that can be tackled half - heartedly			0
modern family planning programs were introduced widely in the developed world decades ago			1
providing voluntary family planning is one of the most cost - effective ways of improving health			1
yet , over 200 million women , overwhelmingly in the poorest countries , who want access to modern family planning still ca n't get this help			1
the results are all too clear			0
girls who are still children themselves become mothers			0
the survival and health of mothers and babies are put at peril			2
complications around giving birth remain the greatest killer of teenage girls in the developing world			1
it is not just young girls who suffer from the lack of control over their own reproductive health			1
enabling women to space pregnancies out by three to five years could almost halve infant death in the poorest countries , one study found			0
the failure to give women access to reliable family planning increases poverty and reduces the number of girls in school and in the workforce			1
lack of money to buy contraceptives , underfunding of family planning programs and lack of trained medical personnel are all major reasons that make life harder for women			1
there is no doubt , too , that cultural and family pressures -- often resting on a lack of women 's equality within their homes and communities -- play a role			2
we have to lift these barriers wherever we find them			0
opinion : want to help poor moms ? provide them with diapers women have traditionally led the fight to improve access to family planning and the provision and quality of maternal health services			1
but the more we are able to recruit men and boys as full partners in this battle , the more progress we can make			1
while men , accidentally or deliberately , can be a barrier to these ambitions , i have also seen how they can be a major part of the solution in the unlikeliest societies			0
there are few countries with a poorer record on maternal and infant health than @entity107 , one of the least - developed nations			1
a traditional society where men wield most of the power , this landlocked nation in @entity111 ranks at the bottom of the @entity115			0
almost all births are at home			0
it helps explain why @entity107 has the highest fertility rate and one of the highest infant death rates in the world			2
opinion : why there are more walk - away moms but a pioneering initiative launched in 2007 , @entity128 , is slowly changing this picture			0
these schools , which have the backing of the civil authorities , traditional and religious leaders , as well as @entity136 support , bring together husbands who believe their wives should play a much more equitable role in their families and communities			0
they meet regularly to discuss and deliver solutions to @entity107 's challenges around maternal and reproductive health			1
this can include building a house for a new community midwife or , after talking to local women 's groups , new toilet facilities at a maternity clinic			0
perhaps even more importantly , they take the message out to new communities about the importance of family planning and proper maternal health care			1
the results where the schools have been established have been impressive			0
use of family planning services has tripled			1
the number of child births attended by skilled personnel doubled			0
more than 170 schools are in @entity107 now			2
the initiative is being extended to new regions in the country and outside its borders			0
it shows that we can make real progress in the most challenging of environments when men build partnerships across the gender divide			2
as we celebrate @entity178 , i challenge all men to think about the commitments they can make to build up our societies by lifting up women , our very own mothers , wives and daughters			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity187 .			2

@entity187 : women need to be able to control their own reproductive health
@entity187 : women in developing world need access to family planning programs
he says we should recruit men and boys as full partners in this battle for women
@entity187 : schools for @entity206 in @entity107 has made progress in getting men involved
