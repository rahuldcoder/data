@entity0 -- government officials should depict terrorists " as the dangerous cult leaders they are " and avoid words that aggrandize them , like " jihadists , " " islamic terrorists , " " islamists " and " holy warriors , " the @entity2 says in a paper released friday			1
a study says muslims in @entity16 prefer the designation " mainstream " over " moderate			1
" " words matter , " the agency says in the paper , which also suggests avoiding the term " moderate @entity15 , " a characterization that annoys many @entity15 because it implies that they are tepid in the practice of their faith			1
" @entity29 , " " ordinary " and " traditional " better reflect the broader @entity28 community , it says			0
@entity30 , head of the agency 's @entity31 and author of the paper , said the paper is a recognition that words can help the government achieve its strategic goals			1
@entity30 said he is starting to see results , with government officials using the term " mainstream @entity15 " in meetings			1
@entity30 's nine - page paper says the government should be careful not to demonize all @entity15 or the @entity42 faith or depict the @entity16 as being at war with @entity42			1
" the terminology the [ government ] uses should convey the magnitude of the threat we face , but also avoid inflating the religious bases and glamorous appeal of the extremists ' ideology , " the paper says			2
the paper emphasizes that the recommendations do not constitute official government policy			2
instead , they represent guidance from influential @entity15 leaders who met with homeland secretary @entity61 in may 2007 to discuss ways that the @entity63 can help the department prevent the violent radicalization of @entity15			1
the paper suggests that government officials may want to avoid using theological terminology altogether			1
" islamic law and terms come with a particular context , which may not always be apparent , " the paper says			2
" it is one thing for a @entity15 leader to use a particular term ; an @entity16 official may simply not have the religious authority to be taken seriously , even when using terms appropriately			2
" the paper , titled " terminology to define the @entity80 : recommendations from @entity28 , " was designated " for official use only " and distributed internally in january			0
@entity30 said the paper was not released publicly because the @entity2 did not want @entity15 leaders to believe their meeting was an attempt to garner publicity			1
but the document was widely distributed in government and was published in late april by @entity90 , " the @entity92 " and others			0
a story about the terminology concerns on the " @entity96 " web site was followed by dozens of comments , most critical of the suggestions			0
" every day , i read another story which angers me			0
this whitewash of @entity42 , by our highest - ranking officials is unacceptable ! " one commenter said			0
the paper is silent on one term frequently used by some people at the highest level of @entity16 government but scorned by others : " @entity111			0
" @entity30 said there is not a consensus on the term			0
some argue that " war " is too grandiose and adds legitimacy to the other side , because there are two legitimate sides to wars			0
" we really face a legitimate threat and we need to guard against complacency , " @entity30 said , explaining the rationale supporting the use of the term .			0
