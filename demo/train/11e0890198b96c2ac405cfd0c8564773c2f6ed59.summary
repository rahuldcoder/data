-- for years , @entity1 has told stories of criminal activity -- first as a writer for " @entity5 " and then as the creator of @entity8 's wildly popular " @entity7 , " a dramatized version of an outlaw biker gang in @entity11			1
now he 's branching out and focusing his lens on real - life criminal organizations			1
the @entity14 recently premiered " @entity1 's @entity15 , " a six - part series that looks at the micro and macro reasons behind groups that have defined their existence outside the law			1
episode one tackles famed @entity24 gang the @entity25 , with subsequent shows exploring outlaw bikers , the @entity29 mob , the @entity31 mafia , the @entity32 and the @entity33			2
" on ' sons , ' we exposed a lot of people to a new world , " @entity1 told @entity0 from @entity24			1
" it humanized what was a stereotype for a lot of people			2
yes , our show is highly dramatic , and we take a lot of dramatic licenses			2
but the reality of it , and details of it are very true , very specific			0
for me , that 's what i wanted to do with this series			2
" the show sprang from a different concept @entity1 was pitching that looked at criminal activity from two points of view , the criminals and law enforcement			1
for the final act , the two sides would be brought together in the same room			0
" the pitch was to have a high - level crime and get the point of view of the criminal party involved and law enforcement and hear their retelling of the same events , " he said			2
" people were intrigued by the concept , but ultimately it felt a little too old school			2
@entity14 was interested in a variation , and they 've wanted to do a high - end documentary series			1
" " @entity15 " explores case studies of a few people involved in the criminal organization , using their stories and knowledge to make larger connections to the context of the outlaw group			1
@entity1 pops up from time to time in cutaways to offer insights into the story he 's trying to tell			1
he 's not interested in getting law enforcement officials , psychologists or other talking heads to weigh in on why these people are " bad			1
" @entity97 , for @entity1 , is telling a story that does n't pass judgment			2
the approach that @entity1 and his team took was n't the typical " let 's pick a subject and tell their story " usually associated with documentary storytelling			1
for him , they started small and worked outward			0
" we tapped into people that had relationships ; some of these guys have been cleaning up their acts -- there 's networks to get to these people , " @entity1 said			1
" we talked to people to see who had the most interesting story			0
it came out of character : who had the most interesting people with the most interesting stories			0
" it was n't so much like ' let 's go do the @entity25			0
let 's go do the @entity33			0
' it was about let 's cast a wide net and be led into the worlds by the characters			0
" @entity1 is putting the finishing touches on the final episodes of " @entity15 " while also in preproduction for the fifth season of " sons			1
" and like the way he portrays his fictional characters , he aims to give viewers a new look at a group of people who have been largely portrayed in a certain way			0
" it 's a challenging thing to do when you 're dealing with guys covered in swastikas , " @entity1 said			1
" you try to go in and give it some context , so people have some point of view to why people did what they did			0
it does n't mean you 're going to get behind it			0
" he added , " the challenge is similar to writing ' sons			0
' when you write an anti-hero , it 's that balance between ' anti ' and ' hero			0
' you ca n't make them too righteous and good so they do n't feel dangerous or believable			0
but you ca n't write them so deplorable that the audience ca n't get behind them			0
it 's similar with this series			2
" " @entity1 's @entity15 " airs at 10 p.m. et mondays on @entity14 .			1
