sixty - two percent of @entity4 primary voters in @entity0 say that if the primary were held today , @entity5 , the prohibitive favorite for the @entity8 ' 2016 presidential nomination , would be their top choice , according to a @entity13 / @entity12 poll released monday			1
the number is a whopping 49 percentage points higher than second - place finisher sen. @entity17 of @entity18			1
independent sen. @entity19 of @entity20 finishes in third with 6 % and vice president @entity22 finishes in fourth with 5 %			0
although @entity2 has not declared her second run at the presidency , the former secretary of state has admitted she is considering a run and many close aides see a campaign as all - but - certain at this point			1
@entity0 has always been welcome ground for the @entity2 family			2
@entity2 's surprising second place finish in the 1992 primary provided his campaign with a symbolic victory and re-energized the @entity37 governor as " @entity2			2
" likewise , in 2008 , after finishing a disappointing third in the @entity40 caucuses , @entity5 used her @entity0 primary win to right her campaign			1
despite her huge lead , even @entity2 's most ardent @entity0 supporters have cautioned her to not take the @entity0 as already in the bag			1
" @entity46 is not a message , it is not something you can run on			0
and in @entity0 , we have a long history of ( frontrunner ) train wrecks , " @entity51 , a longtime @entity2 aide in @entity0 , said last week during a meeting of @entity8			1
@entity51 , who was with @entity2 when he filed his presidential bid papers in 1991 , added : " as i caution all presidential candidates in @entity0 , taking @entity0 for granted is very dangerous			1
last time i believe @entity5 had an almost 30 - point lead in the polls in our state in the summer and that lead melted like an ice sculpture on the mall in @entity66 in july			2
" monday 's poll , however , is not all good news for @entity2			0
in a 2016 general election matchup between @entity2 and @entity71 , the failed 2012 @entity72 nominee , @entity2 's one point lead is within the polls margin of error			0
when matched up against @entity75 , the former @entity72 governor , or @entity77 , the senator from @entity78 , @entity2 enjoyed a 8 and 7 point lead , respectively			0
for @entity82 , the end of the pre-campaign comes with concerns the poll also has good news for @entity78 sen. @entity77			0
in a 10 - person field that includes 2012 @entity87 , @entity77 's the only other potential candidate to break double - digits , taking 11 percent support and coming in second to @entity71 's 30 percent support among @entity87 primary voters			1
with @entity71 out of the picture — though the former @entity18 governor has left the door open , a third bid seems unlikely for him — @entity77 ties for first place with @entity99 gov. @entity98			0
both take 16 percent support among @entity87 primary voters , and former @entity102 gov. @entity75 comes in a close third , with 14 percent			1
the rest of the field takes single - digit support			0
@entity77 's strength in the state comes as no surprise , as its libertarian - leaning population drove his father , former rep. @entity111 , to a second - place finish in the 2012 @entity87 presidential primary there			2
indeed , the results may be more heartening for @entity98 , who 's considered @entity77 's main challenger in the state but has suffered significant damage over the past year due to the scandal surrounding the @entity120 lane closures that cast a pall over his administration			0
the @entity13 poll suggests , however , @entity98 remains competitive in his home region , and that the two will have a fierce fight for the all - important early primary state if they both decide to run , as expected .			0

sixty - two percent of @entity4 primary voters in @entity0 support @entity2
that is 49 percentage points higher than second place finisher sen. @entity17
@entity0 has long been supportive of the @entity137 , @entity5 won the primary in 2008
but even @entity2 supporters in the @entity0 caution against seeing the state as already in the bag
