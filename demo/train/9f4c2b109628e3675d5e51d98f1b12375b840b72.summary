with more body - tracking gadgets that can record everything from running blood pressure to respiration to perspiration rates and more , the next question is -- so what ? what are we supposed to make of the massive amounts of data that these constantly tracking devices amass ? we 're not talking about the familiar pedometer that clunkily clicked away the number of steps you took a day			1
there are a new generation of medical monitoring devices originally meant to evaluate patients in the hospital that have been made over into sexier , wearable versions for the health conscious or merely health - curious			1
the result ? sophisticated and personalized health monitoring that may be generating a lot of information that we are still learning to interpret			1
@entity0 : the quantified self evolves : a @entity7 vision of how gadgets will teach us about ourselve take @entity41 , a wearable body monitoring - systems company that spent its first 10 years developing products for the medical research sector before switching gears to consumer devices in 2009 , targeting individuals who need to lose weight			1
their public - friendly product is a clinically - validated armband that gathers physiological information from three small , sensors underneath the armband			1
the sensors start collecting a flood of 5,000 data points per minute , including measurements of heat flux ( the rate at which heat is dissipating from the body ) , motion , skin temperature and the skin 's electrical conductivity , which are then converted into more meaningful measurements such as the number of calories burned , sleep quality and how efficient the body is overall in performing its metabolic duties			1
" that manifests itself into accuracy , personalization and more of a health orientation			2
we are more than an activity tracker or fitness device , we are actually a health management tool , " says @entity77 , ceo of @entity41 , who held a " @entity80 ( literally ) " session on sunday			1
@entity41 users upload their data online where additional software analyzes the information and relays it in more digestible form			1
users pre-set their body parameters and goals , and the software shows them when they fall behind in the areas like calorie burn , physical activity and sleep efficiency			2
@entity0 : viewpoint : @entity99 wins @entity7 -- how a mayor conquered @entity102 's biggest tech festival @entity7 has a track record in the area ; last year , the @entity105 -- a daily activity tracker -- debuted at the festival , launching a trend toward capturing big health data that is still struggling to find meaning			1
studies show that communities of people who coalesce around a health goal may benefit from the support they receive from each other , but it 's not clear yet that having access to detailed information about the fluctuations in health measures can translate into measurable , healthier outcomes			1
the thought , or hope , among developers is that if the software and hardware of these gadgets and apps are appealing and easy to use , more people will adopt them and that the added information will be motivating , rather than intimidating , and prompt them to make meaningful changes to improve their health			1
the devices are still new , and significant and widespread behavior changes are not apparent yet			2
there 's no guarantee that all of that information will even be welcome , or remain inspiring after the initial thrill wears off			2
studies of people on diets that required them to track and calculate calories , for example , showed that dieters tended to feel overwhelmed by the task and quickly lost interest in shedding pounds			0
" the challenge is establishing what people should do with ( this large volume of new health data ) , " says @entity149 , a senior analyst at @entity150 who led a session on " wearables : moving from niche to @entity159			1
" " a lot of consumers do n't think health is their responsibility and that it 's in the realm of their doctor			2
for some companies , to sell a device and track health is not resonating with people			2
" @entity41 , for example , plans to turn their years of medical research knowledge into a series of monitoring devices for chronic diseases ranging from sleep disorders to diabetes management			1
but appealing to consumers outside of those who normally track their metabolic measures -- like athletes and dieters -- could be a challenge			0
so far , the benefits of these devices come in the form of the support they get from joining online communities			0
most of the devices connect to smartphones and allow users to download or share the data collected -- seeding social networks of like - minded data - curious individuals who want to broadcast and analyze their latest blood pressure or skin conductivity numbers			2
that makes the devices an ideal fit for @entity204 , says @entity205 , the festival 's director			0
" a lot of these business models center around the idea of building a fitness community or a healthy eating community			0
community is certainly one of the bedrocks here at @entity7 , " says @entity205			2
" at our best moments we really celebrate and foster a sense of community , so a lot of these fitness - related apps and services really leverage that			0
" @entity223 , a social networking tool that uses cloud - based technology to aggregate measurements of users ' body and lifestyle choices spawned a community centered around the " higi score , " an aggregated measure that represents their overall health status			1
personal interactions , like your relationship status , how many friends you have on @entity239 and community engagements and how often you send encouraging words to fellow users , all count toward the score			0
users can update their health stats via their smartphone , or at higi stations -- which are now located in thousands of retail pharmacies -- with their weight , @entity250 , pulse and height			0
users can even upload photos of their meals for a calorie calculation			0
and to make it more interesting , members can compete in the @entity259 for high scores -- topping off at 999 -- or work together to improve their scores , since the amount of interaction you have with people impacts your personal number			0
" people who collect their data , share their data , " says @entity267 , higi creator and founder			0
" it allows one to see improvements all the time and change habits			0
the ( user 's ) ranking in the world and in the community is changing by the second			0
you are the stock on the market , and it can go up and down depending on what 's going on in your community			0
we want to make it so it is not work , but a game			0
" @entity0 : listen now -- 9 new bands worth celebrating at @entity7 while it 's not clear yet that having access to detailed information about the fluctuations in health measures can translate into measurable , healthier outcomes , there is no denying that the health , fitness and tech spheres continue to provide more ways to educate people about their bodies			1
@entity205 says health and fitness has become a popular theme of the festival , which now includes organized daily runs for attendees and more sessions focused on health - related technology and apps			2
and the products are by no means reserved for tech - buffs and social media over-sharers			0
as always , our ability to interpret and make use of all that health information lags behind the innovations made in collecting it			1
but if information is indeed power , that may soon change			0

tracking body data emerges as a major theme at @entity7 this year
we are still learning how to interpret all the information from the new devices
one company , @entity41 , says its product is a " health management tool "
