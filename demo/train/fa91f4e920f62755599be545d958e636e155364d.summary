@entity0 was a first - time topic for our sunday trip around the " @entity5 " table , along with some key things -- and people -- to watch for as we leave 2014 behind and brace for 2015 and 2016			1
@entity10 's @entity9 and other top political reporters empty out their notebooks each sunday on " @entity5 " to reveal five things that will be in the headlines in the days , weeks and months ahead			2
an @entity16 briefing room strategy that may be popular at home -- and with @entity18 president @entity16 had a busy friday -- delaying his @entity20 vacation so he could hold his year - end news conference and sit down for a farewell interview with @entity10 's @entity23			1
so might the wife and kids be a little peeved that their @entity27 break got off to a later start ? not so fast , says @entity29 's @entity28			2
at that press conference , the president called only on women reporters , and @entity28 suggests there might be a benefit -- or benefits -- for the commander in chief			2
" some may have just been goodwill to appease @entity38 and the girls before he embarks on several rounds of golf in @entity20 , but there are a couple other things at play , " said @entity28			0
" some of this is about his own legacy , but a lot is about gearing up for 2016			0
the women 's vote is going to be essential for @entity18 ( @entity52 are trying to work on that as well )			2
and you 're seeing him set up that fight going into the new year			0
clintons are " going crazy " because they think @entity58 's gearing up for a run @entity61 sen. @entity60 insists she is not not not not not going to run for president in 2016			1
but that wo n't stop liberal groups from pleading			0
and @entity65 of the @entity66 shared with us reporting on how @entity58 plans to be a constant source of pressure on front - runner @entity70 even if she never comes close to being a candidate			1
" i talked to a longtime friend of hers who said the @entity57 do n't understand this -- they think this is all some kind of a setup for her to run for president , " said @entity65			1
" this friend of @entity58 said this is who she is			1
she really believes in this stuff			0
and she gets the fact that she has this moment , and she 's taking advantage of that			1
jindal a 2016 @entity52 sleeper to watch in @entity89 @entity91 gov. @entity90 fires out frequent press releases to national political reporters and aggressively makes the rounds to the states and events that raise a presidential profile			2
yet he has been largely ignored in 2016 speculation and barely registers in polls			0
but @entity100 of the @entity101 says his recent visit to @entity89 convinced him to keep an eye on @entity90 and his early efforts			0
" he may be a @entity106 convert , he may be from a @entity108 state , but he spent a lot of time this week making connections with @entity89 evangelicals , " said @entity100			0
" i was with him in @entity113 and he spent over three hours shaking hands , making a speech about his conversion and his roots and his family 's immigrant story			2
should all eyes be on the @entity121 ? the spotlight will be on the new @entity52 @entity124 majority and majority leader @entity125 when the 114th @entity126 gavels in			1
but maybe the other chamber is really the one to watch			0
a lot of the new senators are expected to vote with the @entity52 leadership , but insiders on the @entity132 have been telling the @entity134 's @entity133 that there 's a lot more uncertainty about what 's going to happen in the @entity121			1
" it 's a real wild card in the @entity121 whether ( speaker john ) @entity140 is going to be empowered by this larger majority or whether they 're going to be a bigger thorn in his side in the way we 've seen in the past , " said @entity133			1
" so as we look to whether the relative harmony and lack of drama of this lame - duck period can continue in the new @entity126 , i think that 's going to be a major factor			1
february flashpoints will test @entity156 's new role and the @entity158 's power january will likely be a relatively peaceful month here in @entity160			1
the new @entity126 will be organizing and the president will deliver his @entity163 address			1
but february will hit some major @entity52 flashpoints			0
@entity126 first and foremost needs to revisit the immigration debate , because it has to fund the @entity166			1
and it is in february when @entity156 plans to have his promised vote to repeal @entity170			0
@entity156 knows he does n't have the votes for an @entity170 repeal or to force any sweeping reversals of the new @entity121 immigration policy			2
so what he 's hoping for is to put some votes on the record and then look for incremental steps on things that can inspire at least modest @entity183 support			0
he believes the vast majority of his @entity52 members are ready now to ignore the @entity158 complaints of surrender			0
@entity156 's take is that 2014 proved the tea party is loud , but not able to deliver on threats to @entity52 incumbents			0
february will test whether other @entity52 buy that .			0

the *calculations* behind @entity16 's " girl power " moment at the press briefing
@entity57 " going crazy " because they think @entity58 's going to run
does the @entity121 hold the key to whether @entity126 is *naughty* or nice in 2015 ?
