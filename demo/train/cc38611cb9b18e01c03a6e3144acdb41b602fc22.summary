@entity0 -- nearly a dozen republicans who might be considering a run for the @entity2 presidential nomination in 2016 are auditioning in front of the @entity6 , which touts itself as the largest and oldest annual gathering of conservatives			1
on friday , @entity9 , the 2012 @entity2 presidential nominee , will speak at @entity6			1
if @entity9 is the @entity2 's past , then senators @entity10 of @entity11 and @entity12 of @entity13 are the @entity2 's future			1
both men , considered leading 2016 @entity2 @entity18 hopefuls , gave back - to - back and dueling speeches thursday			1
although different in style and with divergent plans to revitalize a party that 's lost the last two presidential elections , both men praised the conservative cause			1
" we do n't need a new idea			0
the idea is called @entity30 , and it still works , " @entity10 said to loud applause			0
@entity12 said that for the @entity2 to win , " liberty needs to be the backbone of the @entity2			1
" @entity34 gov. @entity33 spoke a few hours later			0
his 2012 bid for the @entity2 nomination crashed and burned , but he is considering another run in 2016			1
@entity33 used his address to criticize @entity9 and @entity40 sen. @entity39 , the 2008 @entity2 nominee			1
" the popular media narrative is that this country has shifted away from conservative ideals , as evidenced by the last two presidential elections			2
that 's what they say , " @entity33 said			2
" that might be true if @entity2 had actually nominated conservative candidates in 2008 and 2012			2
" on friday , former sen. @entity50 of @entity51 , a conservative favorite who battled @entity9 deep into last year 's @entity2 primary calendar , is scheduled to make several appearances			1
@entity50 could make another run for the @entity18 in 2016			2
big @entity6 surprise : @entity56 not on ballot later in the afternoon @entity59 gov. @entity58 , who is also considered a possible presidential hopeful , will address the crowd			1
so will @entity63 chairman @entity62 , the congressman from @entity64 who was @entity9 's running mate			1
and friday night former @entity11 gov. @entity56 , who lately has openly discussed 2016 , will keynote a @entity6 dinner			1
@entity64 gov. @entity66 , sen. @entity67 of @entity34 and former @entity69 gov. @entity68 will appear on saturday			0
@entity67 was born in @entity70 to an @entity30 mother and @entity73 father ; his eligibility for president has been subject to debate			0
@entity2 strategist and @entity1 contributor @entity77 said there 's a reason @entity18 hopefuls come to the conference			1
" @entity6 is where all 2016 candidates need to go to pass the conservative litmus test : are they for freedom , or for something less , " said @entity77 , who is spearheading a new super-pac called the @entity87 to refocus the party 's messaging and policy goals			1
@entity12 , @entity10 provide competing glimpses of a revamped @entity2 @entity2 strategist and @entity1 contributor @entity95 said @entity6 is a must - do for anyone remotely thinking about the nomination			1
" there 's not many other events where they all accept the invitation and are happy to parade one after the other , modeling in their swimsuits and evening gowns hoping to be amongst the finalists , " she said			2
the conference , which draws tons of attention , has been increasingly critiqued as more political carnival than conference			2
regardless , the confab will once again end with its @entity2 presidential nomination straw poll , which is considered by many as a key gauge of conservative sentiment and garners much media coverage			1
but there 's also been plenty of criticism in recent years that the @entity6 straw poll is not the indicator it once was			1
" it 's a more an anecdotal measurement than an empirical one			2
its relevance as a prediction of grassroots strength within the party has waned over the last few years			0
it can , however , give someone who is n't well known a shot of adrenaline so that they 're more prominently featured in any of the chatter about 2016 , " said @entity131 , a @entity2 strategist who served as a senior adviser to @entity9 in both his 2012 and 2008 presidential campaigns			1
" folks should n't read too much into the results			0
straw polls are kind of like political junk food			0
you know it 's all empty calories , but some folks eat it anyway			0
" @entity6 straw poll list shows wide array of 2016 potential @entity2 analyst @entity151 says the poll means nothing three years out from the election and it represents only part of the party			1
" if we 've learned anything from @entity6 it 's that the conference does not represent mainstream @entity2 thinking			1
the poll is routinely hijacked by whomever wants to spend the money to get the eight hours of attention , " said @entity151 , who advised actor and former @entity164 sen. @entity163 during his 2008 @entity2 presidential bid and is author of @entity167 , an online column			1
" last year we not only did a straw poll but also had a national poll we announced simultaneously , " said @entity173 , chairman of the @entity174 , the organization that puts on the conference			2
" the outcomes were identical			0
the same order of top three finishers in the straw poll were the same order as the top three finishers in the national poll , and so to those skeptics who were concerned about the accuracy of the straw poll , the national poll provided empirical evidence that it was a pretty good representative sample of what 's going on			0
" @entity9 finished first in both polls , ahead of @entity50 and former house speaker @entity188			2
this time around there are 23 names on the straw poll ballot , including some who were not invited to @entity6			2
among those on the ballot who wo n't be speaking is @entity196 , the tough - talking @entity197 governor who is considered a leading prospect for the 2016 nomination			0
while popular in his party , @entity196 angered some on the right after praising president @entity203 for the federal response to @entity205 , which devastated parts of the @entity197 just days before the november election			0
@entity196 also criticized @entity18 @entity2 for temporarily holding up federal aid following the storm			2
major conservative conference comes at crucial time for @entity2 @entity214 gov. @entity213 also may have designs on the @entity18 , but he is not addressing @entity6			1
earlier this year he pushed through a transportation plan that included tax increases , considered heresy among fiscal conservatives			2
though he does n't have a keynote speaking role , he is part of a panel session at the conference			0
others on the ballot without speaking spots include @entity229 gov. @entity228 ; former @entity231 gov. @entity230 , who now heads @entity232 ; and @entity234 sen. @entity233 , a major @entity9 surrogate last year			1
neurosurgeon @entity235 interestingly appears on the poll -- the only one on the list who 's never been elected to public office			0
he generated buzz in conservative circles after he advocated conservative policies on taxes and health care in front of president @entity203 while keynoting the national prayer breakfast last month			0
there 's one glaring omission from the 23 names on the straw poll ballot : @entity56 , who asked not to be on the list			0
@entity196 dismisses lack of @entity6 invite " it was our request to mr. @entity173 when he extended the invite for gov. @entity56 to speak			1
we asked not to be included , as gov. @entity56 has said repeatedly , it is too early to think about 2016 , " @entity56 spokesperson @entity258 told @entity1 chief @entity0 correspondent @entity260			0
for many conservative activists attending @entity6 , the straw poll is fun , but they do n't take it too seriously			2
" i do n't put much weight on it			0
it 's a fun way of getting to see opinions , but it does n't predict anything , " said @entity268 of @entity269 , @entity214			0
" i did it for fun			0
why not ? but there 's so much time between now and then , " said @entity274 , a recent @entity275 graduate and first time straw poll voter			0
@entity280 of @entity281 , @entity282 , sees a value in the straw poll			0
" we 've got to start thinking about someone , do n't we ? " she said the results may reflect the hopes and dreams of some , but added that the straw poll is " a popularity contest			0
" @entity1 political coverage manager @entity293 contributed to this report			0
