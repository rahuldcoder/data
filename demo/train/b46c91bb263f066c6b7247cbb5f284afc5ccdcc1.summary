@entity0 -- you do not have to be an investor in the stock market or real estate or looking for a job to be alarmed when several highly regarded observers warn that the @entity9 economy is about to be driven " off the cliff " by increasing debt , the expiration of tax cuts and the prospect of deep spending cuts			1
the alarm should concern anyone who cares about our democratic system			0
the reason we are getting awfully close to the edge is because the @entity22 and @entity23 are inclined to pull the steering wheel in opposite directions			0
granted , alarms are often sounded , but as we shall see shortly , this time there are strong reasons to fear that our gridlocked political system will prevent us from responding before we go over the edge			0
the most authoritative voice speaking out this time is that of @entity32 , the chairman of the @entity33			0
he stated recently that , " it is very important to say that if no action were to be taken by the fiscal authorities , the size of the fiscal cliff is such that there is , i think , absolutely no chance that the @entity33 could or would have any ability whatsoever to offset that effect on the economy			1
" @entity45 , the highly regarded ceo of the investment management firm @entity46 , wrote recently in an article in the @entity49 headline " the @entity50 " that , " in the next few months , possibly within weeks , markets here and abroad will be looking for signals that our politicians understand the severity of the situation and are able and willing to act appropriately			1
if clear signals are not forthcoming , markets could react early to the looming trouble , compounding the uncertainties that weigh on the @entity9 economy			1
" the economist changed the metaphor but not the point			0
under the title " cliff diving , " it predicts that @entity69 is unlikely to pass a " grand bargain " before the end of the year and that " [ c ] redit - rating agencies may well lose patience " before lawmakers get their act together			1
this in turn would lead to higher interest rates that might well push the fragile economy into another recession			2
the main reason @entity32 and other financial and political observers are worried is that by the end of the year , we will face what might be called a triple witching hour			0
at that time , the @entity87 tax cuts will expire and the payroll tax holiday will end			1
additionally , @entity69 has committed itself to cutting spending by about $ 100 billion next year and more than $ 1 trillion over the next decade			2
if the @entity87 tax cuts and payroll tax holiday are extended , and @entity69 wriggles its way out of its commitment to cut spending , the deficit will swell to the point where alarmists see us going the way of @entity100			1
if the @entity87 tax cuts and payroll holiday are not extended , and @entity69 lives up to its commitment to cut spending , the drag on the economy will be severe			1
the economy is expected to decline by 3.5 % to 5 % ; that is , it will be pushed back into a serious recession			2
no wonder some predict " @entity110			0
" dealing with this dilemma requires political cooperation between the @entity23 and the @entity22 , between both houses of @entity69 and the president			0
few expect the sides to reach a major deal before the elections			2
that is , under the best of circumstances , we will come close to the edge of the financial cliff because these matters must be settled by the first of the year , and markets often do not wait for the actual date to tank -- they anticipate			1
assuming we somehow will be spared until the elections -- what will happen after november 6 ? while that depends on the election results , people should note that the current power setup will be in place until january 20			1
thus , even if @entity137 is elected president , @entity136 will still be in the @entity139 when the master deal must be struck , the @entity22 will still have a majority in the @entity142 , and the @entity23 will still be able to filibuster and control the @entity139			2
@entity143 of @entity144 aptly described the evolving conditions as " a slow - motion train wreck			0
" @entity147 , president of the @entity148 , asked , " how do you plan for chaos ? it 's almost a unique moment in government because there 's so much at stake			0
and there 's nothing that inspires confidence that [ a congressional deal ] will get done			2
" political theorists hold that democracies need crises to focus leaders ' and voters ' minds and get bickering parties to work together to find a solution			0
this is not what happened in @entity100 and may well not be in the cards for several other @entity171 nations that are challenged by a similar crisis			0
i assume we will do better , but investors may do well to pull in their horns , and citizens ought to tell their representatives in no uncertain terms that the time to act in unison is now -- we ca n't afford to risk waiting until after the november election			1
fasten your seat belt , because even if it all works out well in the end , it will be a cliffhanger			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity188 .			1

experts warn of a *drastic* hit to @entity9 economy if politicians do n't avert " fiscal cliff "
@entity9 faces scary combination of the mounting debt , tax cut expirations , spending cuts
@entity188 : we ca n't afford to wait for after the election to deal with these issues
he says markets , credit agencies often anticipate events , rather than wait for them to happen
