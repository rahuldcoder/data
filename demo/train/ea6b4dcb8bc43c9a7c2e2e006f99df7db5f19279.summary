editor 's note : in our @entity5 series , @entity3 correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind events			2
@entity11 , who helped write the @entity3 special report " black in @entity13 , " is author of the 2004 book " @entity19 , " which profiles the children of the civil rights movement 's leading figures and of segregationists			1
@entity20 , second from left , says he yearned for his father 's advice while he was growing up			1
( @entity3 ) -- the rev. @entity23 was a civil rights icon , but for one man , he 's something else : the father he barely remembers			1
@entity20 's eldest son , @entity20 , was 11 years old when his father was assassinated			1
his family broke the news to him by saying : " @entity32 is going to go home to live with @entity34			2
" @entity20 's memories of his father are now fragmentary : kissing him when he returned from his frequent travels , tossing a softball , riding a bicycle with him			1
he learned to accept his loss , but there were moments when it hurt			2
" when i was growing up and i wanted to talk to my father to get advice , and no one was there , it hit then , " he said			2
" it hit me when my mom would say , ' your father would be so proud of you today			1
" most people know how the civil rights movement changed the nation			1
i had another question : how did it change the families of the movement 's biggest leaders -- and the families of their segregationist foes ? the stories i heard from people like @entity20 helped me answer that question			1
@entity20 was one of 23 " children of the movement " i talked to over a two - year period starting in 2002			1
i wanted to know what they could tell me about their parents that did n't make it into the history books			1
what were they doing with their own lives ? what happened to the movement 's leaders after april 4 , 1968 ? @entity20 , as expected , talked about the pressures of being the son of a civil rights icon			1
what surprised me , though , was that so many other children of these famous leaders had a far different problem -- they did n't know that their parents were famous civil rights leaders			1
@entity90 's daughter , @entity89 , comes to mind			2
when she first attended college in @entity93 , she became a campus celebrity			2
her classmates gathered around her and asked her to share stories about her father			2
she had none to share , though			2
@entity99 knew that her father was a civil rights activist , but her family never talked in detail about that side of him			1
she actually had to take a history class and buy " @entity104 " to learn more about her father			0
the children of other important movement leaders would tell similar stories			1
one woman said she did n't know her father was a civil rights hero until she ended up studying him in social studies class			1
one learned that his father was important when he saw him flee from a mob in a civil rights documentary			1
" he was just a father , " @entity115 's son , @entity114 , said when i asked why he did n't know that his father -- who coined the term " black power " -- was a symbol of black militancy			0
" he never told me what he did , really			0
he just told me what was good to do : ' work for your people			0
' " i wondered why this was happening			0
then some movement scholars helped me understand			1
i had not understood how brutal the movement was			1
i saw it as a @entity131 movie -- people marching in the sunshine , @entity20 speaking , and victory			1
many of these front - line activists lived under the constant threat of death			0
some were tortured in jail			0
several were disowned by their families			1
their memories were too painful to share with their children			1
yet their reticence put their children in a bind			1
after they became adults , strangers would approach them and ask : " how are you going to fulfill your parent 's legacy ? " how could they answer when they did n't even know what that legacy was ? these activists faced another emotional hurdle besides their painful memories			2
how do you top being part of a history - making movement ? many of them experienced a massive emotional letdown after their time in the movement			2
the rev. @entity165 gave the movement one of its most unforgettable images			2
a photographer snapped a shot of him after he was almost beaten to death by a mob at an @entity172 bus station			0
@entity165 was part of an interracial group of college students who attempted to integrate interstate bus travel during the " @entity177			0
" but @entity165 struggled to find his way after that photo made him famous			0
he entered therapy and even contemplated suicide			0
he could never find a cause that made him feel so alive			0
" it 's a tremendous downer , " he said			0
" you look for it everywhere			0
i 've never experienced it since			0
" the difficulties their parents experienced had another unexpected effect on their children : it turned some away from activism			1
there 's no retirement plan for civil rights activists			1
a few movement leaders found ways to parlay their experiences into political careers , but many of them struggled financially			1
their children grew up with the sense that their parents had given too much and received too little in return			1
they were n't going to make that mistake			0
the son of @entity208 , @entity20 's close aide and the former mayor of @entity210 , @entity211 , was one such person			1
@entity212 scoffed at the idea of becoming a politician or activist			0
he 's an entrepreneur who wants to be a millionaire			0
when i asked him about integration , he was interested in only one kind : " i want to integrate the money			0
" the biggest surprise came from the children of the segregationists			2
they seemed to experience the least amount of conflict over the lives of their parents			2
each of them said their fathers were n't racists and were great politicians			0
the daughter of @entity235 -- the @entity172 governor who once boasted that segregation would last forever -- said her father had to be a segregationist to get elected			2
" it was n't that he hated blacks , " @entity239 told me			0
" he treated everybody ... who cooked and cleaned for us at the @entity247 like his own family			0
i saw it and swear to it			0
he would never mistreat one of them			0
" my favorite moment during these interviews , though , came when someone shared a question with me			0
i was talking to @entity256 , the daughter of @entity257 , the only woman to lead the @entity258			0
she talked about growing up surrounded by armed men in black leather jackets and having a bodyguard accompany her at all times -- even when she went to the ice cream truck			0
despite the danger , she marvels at the idealism of her mother and panther leaders			2
they were going to try to change the world , even if it meant dying for their cause -- and many did , she said			0
she , like so many children of the movement , now wonders if their parents ' pain was worth it			1
" if you 've been told all your whole life that you were born for revolution , " she asked me , " what do you do with your life when the revolution never comes ? "			0

@entity20 : it was painful to hear mom say dad would be proud
families were never the same , according to some children of movement
civil rights leaders were *traumatized* by struggle
some children of segregationist leaders remain proud of their parents
