-- " @entity2 " helmer @entity0 told @entity1 in november that he would n't be taking the reins of another intergalactic franchise : @entity6 's upcoming " @entity7 " extension			1
but a new interview in @entity9 reveals that initially , @entity0 did entertain the idea of putting his stamp on " @entity7			2
" the " @entity13 " creator said that he and @entity14 , the series 's new overseer , had " very early conversations " about how he might be involved in " @entity7 : @entity19 's " development			1
ultimately , though , the longtime @entity21 trilogy admirer decided against picking up a lightsaber of his own			0
" i quickly said that because of my loyalty to ' @entity2 , ' and also just being a fan , i would n't even want to be involved in the next version of those things , " @entity0 told @entity9			1
" i declined any involvement very early on			0
i 'd rather be in the audience not knowing what was coming , rather than being involved in the minutiae of making them			0
@entity0 has made no secret of his affection for " @entity7			1
" by contrast , he had no such nostalgic attachment to " @entity2 " before signing on to direct it -- which may have made it easier for him to revamp that franchise			1
" @entity41 " screenwriter @entity40 has already signed on to pen " @entity19 , " which is scheduled to hit theaters in 2015			2
" x-men : first class " director @entity46 was rumored to be in talks for the film last month ; since we know @entity0 is out of the picture , confirmation of @entity46 's â € ” or another director 's â € ” involvement may come soon			0
