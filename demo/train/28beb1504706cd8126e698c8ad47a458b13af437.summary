-- @entity2 president @entity1 begins a key @entity4 trip monday during a pivotal moment of his presidency			1
he will use a series of key meetings this week to re-assert @entity2 global leadership at a time when the @entity2 , and the wider @entity11 , has appeared to be on the back foot following @entity14 's incursion into @entity15 and subsequent annexation of @entity17			1
the immediate focal point will be an emergency meeting of the @entity20 which will take place at @entity22 ( @entity23 ) monday and tuesday in the @entity24			1
the @entity20 session will convene on the margins of the @entity23 to discuss next steps for tackling the crisis in @entity15 , including deterring the prospect of @entity14 military moves into eastern and southern @entity15			1
the agenda here is at least two-fold : bolstering the new leadership in @entity34 , and threatening further economic punishment of @entity36			0
on the former , @entity15 signed last friday an agreement on closer economic and political cooperation with the @entity40			2
moreover , @entity41 has confirmed that it is providing @entity34 with " non-lethal assistance " that could include intelligence and satellite imagery , and / or key equipment such as night - vision goggles			0
coordinated new waves of sanctions against @entity14 will also be discussed			2
the @entity2 and the 28 member @entity40 have already imposed travel bans and selective asset freezes against key @entity14 and @entity17 officials , and a bank deemed to have close ties with the @entity55			2
it is recognized , however , that further escalation may be needed , and @entity1 will seek to find consensus on this given the differing bilateral interests with @entity14 of the @entity20 countries			1
potential measures include widening the punitive measures against targeted @entity14 and @entity17 officials and institutions ; an arms embargo ; @entity36 's expulsion from the @entity68 ; and wider , more politically sensitive economic sanctions			2
the scene was set for the latter last thursday when @entity1 signed an executive order expanding the @entity2 government 's authority to take financial and trade measures with the @entity40 against key @entity14 industries			1
in the face of some strident recent domestic @entity2 criticism of his foreign policy , @entity1 will also have platforms to showcase presidential leadership at both the @entity40 - @entity2 summit on wednesday , and the @entity23 where he will meet with more than 50 national leaders including @entity85 president @entity84 nuclear terrorism the @entity23 , which will focus on measures to enhance security of nuclear material stockpiles and facilities across the world , is the brainchild of @entity1 who believes that nuclear terrorism represents " the most immediate and extreme threat to global security			1
" the downturn in relations between @entity14 and the @entity11 is unfortunate here given that @entity36 is a pre-eminent player in attempts to counter the nuclear terrorism threat			2
indeed , this issue first came prominently onto the international radar screen following the collapse of the @entity105 when major concerns were raised about safeguarding its nuclear weaponry			0
more recently , the urgency of tackling this agenda was given impetus by the september 2001 attacks			0
this was widely interpreted as a " wake - up call " about the possibility that a terrorist group could detonate a small nuclear weapon , or a radiological dispersal device ( a so - called " dirty bomb " )			0
while the conventional wisdom is that the probability of a major nuclear terrorism event is very low , the consequences would be so dramatic that it remains a major pre-occupation of the international community			0
given the difficulties of terrorist groups obtaining weapons grade material , perhaps the bigger danger is a dirty bomb attack			0
here , conventional explosives would be used to spread radiation from a radioactive source			0
such radioactive sources are relatively widely available , including at hospitals			0
only last december , law enforcement authorities in @entity137 discovered a vehicle believed to have been stolen by thieves which contained radioactive medical materials that could have been used to power a dirty bomb			0
@entity22 goals amongst the ambitious goals for the @entity23 include : ratification of the amended @entity146 by more countries to ensure that the amendment enters into force as soon as possible ; more frequent reviews of state security structures by the @entity152 ; national registration and protection of highly radioactive sources ( e.g. medical equipment ) ; and a greater role for industry in nuclear security to enhance the security culture and existing regulations			1
following up on the summit , a significant body of further work will be needed to achieve @entity1 's stated ambition to " secure all vulnerable nuclear material around the world " during his presidency			1
the next @entity23 will be in @entity41 in 2016 and will coincide with his last year in the @entity169			0
given recent criticism of his foreign policy , and conscious of his place in history , @entity1 sees enhancing global nuclear security as a key part of his presidential legacy , especially following the agreement he signed with @entity36 on the @entity178 ( @entity178 ) which will see both countries reduce their deployed nuclear arsenals			1
building upon this success , he will now seek to secure the strongest possible outcomes from the @entity23 process , and also push hard for a comprehensive nuclear deal to be reached with @entity185 to follow - up on last year 's breakthrough preliminary agreement			0
