@entity0 -- the @entity3 administration and many of its national security critics agree that it 's time to revisit the war authorization that @entity7 approved a week after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks			1
but when to end it and how to replace it is another matter			0
the @entity12 defeated an amendment by rep. @entity14 , @entity15 , that would have " sunsetted " the so - called " never - ending war " a year from now			1
attention now turns to the @entity18 and whether a proposal will emerge there			0
the law authorized a military response to the terrorist attacks by striking back against @entity24 and associated forces , including their @entity27 allies , who at the time ruled @entity30			1
its scope is broad enough that it has been used by successive administrations to carry out military attacks as far afield as @entity35 and @entity36			0
when to end it is a prickly enough issue that the @entity12 has done little to move ahead with president @entity3 's promise , as described in a 2013 speech at the @entity40 , to work with @entity7 to " refine and ultimately repeal " the @entity41 , or @entity42			1
as in other national security policy fights -- that of drones , for instance -- the rise of tea party - affiliated libertarians and @entity3 's sagging popularity have scrambled some of the traditional alliances on the war authorization			1
liberals and right - leaning libertarians who criticize the war authorization as too much of a blank check to the president are uniting to support a repeal of it as a way to assert congressional authority			1
some conservatives -- who not long ago supported extending the current @entity42 -- now suggest replacing it with a law that specifies the groups the @entity67 is fighting			1
" i think we have abdicated our responsibility to define the nature of the conflict we 're in , " @entity14 said in an interview			0
his amendment appeared to have gained steam , in part because the @entity12 has struggled to make clear what it thinks should happen			2
at a @entity81 hearing wednesday , senior lawyers from the @entity79 departments said repealing the law would do no harm to national security or affect military operations , because the president 's executive powers allow a military response to any threats to the nation			0
and yet , they would n't say whether the administration supported ending the war now			0
" we 're not here to say it should be repealed today , " said @entity93 , deputy legal adviser at the @entity94			0
the issue matters because @entity67 forces are exiting a war in @entity30 that lasted more than twice as long as @entity101 some legal experts believe that development adds some pressure to replace the existing @entity42 , in part , because the main @entity24 forces that attacked the @entity67 have been decimated , even as new offshoots have metastasized the terrorist threat to parts of @entity35 , @entity110 and the @entity111			1
@entity112 , attorney general under president @entity113 , said at the wednesday hearing that he supports the idea of @entity7 revisiting the authorization to clarify its intent			0
@entity118 , the @entity94 's top lawyer under secretary of state @entity119 , said the law should be narrowed and eventually repealed			0
administration officials say part of the complication lies in ongoing negotiations with @entity30 over whether the @entity67 will retain forces in that country after this year , a deal that ca n't be reached until after @entity30 elects a new president in june			2
" as we work with the government of @entity30 to identify an appropriate @entity67 military presence in @entity30 after 2014 ; as we continue to make progress towards the closure of the detention facility at @entity137 ; and as we continue to work with our friends and partners around the world to provide assistance and training to counter @entity24 and its associated forces , we will engage further with @entity7 and the @entity67 people on efforts to ensure that the legal authorities for our counterterrorism and detention operations are appropriately tailored , " said @entity129 , spokeswoman for the @entity130			1
" in keeping with our ongoing efforts to realign our forces and capabilities after the drawdown in @entity30 , we look forward to engaging the @entity7 on the president 's goal of refining and ultimately repealing the @entity42 , " she added			2
only three years ago , @entity7 was being pressured to expand the authorization			0
in 2011 , rep. @entity157 , @entity158 , tried to pass a new @entity42 to reaffirm the war against @entity24 and to try to restrict the president 's hand on issues such as the plan to close the @entity137 prison			1
@entity157 's push to give the existing war authorization more life has partly influenced the @entity3 administration 's effort on the issue			1
two administration officials told @entity1 that part of the reason for the @entity12 's hesitation is the fear that some congressional hawks would use the opportunity to expand the so - called @entity178			2
or that the administration could end up without any authorization at all			2
in his @entity182 speeches this year and last , @entity3 said he aimed to pull the @entity67 back from its " permanent war footing			1
" some congressional critics say @entity3 's policies appear to prematurely declare victory over @entity24 's core leadership , and ignore the growing threat from affiliates such as @entity191 and groups fighting in @entity110 , @entity193 and @entity194			2
with partisan bickering sowing gridlock in @entity7 , passing any law on the war authorization is a tall order			1
@entity7 is also debating surveillance law changes in the wake of the leaks about the @entity67 government 's spying activities by former @entity207 contractor @entity205			0
@entity14 scoffs at the notion it 's too hard to tackle			0
" we drafted the @entity42 in days after 9/11 ; we should be able to do this in a year , " he said			0
after all , " one of the most important things that @entity7 does is to declare war and define the focus of that war			0

the @entity41 was approved in 2001
it allows the @entity67 to go after @entity24 and its associates
some say @entity42 should be repealed or refined
