-- as more technology goes mobile , " where " has become one of the key pieces of context in daily life			0
and the answers to " where " increasingly are provided through geographic information systems ( @entity9 ) , a technology that is being explored , debated and celebrated today in public			1
it 's @entity13 , and events are being held in 45 @entity16 states and 59 countries			2
find a @entity13 event near you @entity9 is an umbrella term to describe tools used to gather , transform , manipulate , analyze and produce information about real - world places			1
it 's used to create maps and 3 - d models , and to provide information to create more accurate reports and make better decisions			2
it also powers popular interactive services like @entity32 , or gps features that help apps on your smartphone know what you mean by " nearby			0
" the point of @entity13 is to demonstrate uses of @entity9 that are making a difference in society , from getting driving directions on your cell phone to geocaching games to the global response to the @entity48 earthquake			1
presentations , demonstrations and discussions will cover such far - ranging topics as transportation , defense , education , agriculture and more			0
i 'll be attending the @entity13 event at the @entity60 , where i 'm hoping to try out the free app @entity61 on my @entity64 phone in a geocaching exercise			1
some @entity13 events ( like the @entity60 one ) are conference - style and geared toward adults			1
but many are specifically kid - and family - friendly			0
for instance , @entity71 in @entity72 , @entity73 , is hosting a @entity13 event that includes first - graders making " map hats " and fourth - and fifth - graders playing geo - " @entity79			1
" most events are free and open to the public			0
@entity13 grew out of @entity82 , an annual campaign launched in 1987 by the @entity84 to promote geo - literacy and draw attention to " the importance of geographic understanding in ensuring our nation 's economic competitiveness , national security , environmental sustainability , and the livability of our communities in the 21st century			1
" of course , @entity9 technology is n't all roses and sunshine			0
when @entity9 - enabled devices or systems know where you are and where you 've been , it opens substantial concerns about privacy , safety , security and equity			2
@entity9 technology can pave the way for the more effective or equitable delivery of products and services , or it can empower communities to better look after their own local interests			0
but it can also enable new types of discriminatory " redlining , " or encourage overeager law enforcement agencies to snoop			0
how much locative information is ok to share , and who should have access to it ? where to draw that line will probably be one of the most important " where " questions discussed at today 's @entity13 events .			2

@entity13 aims to show how geographic information systems can aid society
@entity135 will be attending the @entity13 event at the @entity60
@entity13 grew out of @entity82 , an annual campaign launched in 1987
