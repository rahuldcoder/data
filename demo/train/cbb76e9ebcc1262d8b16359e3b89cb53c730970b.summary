@entity0 -- never mind the traffic , car owners in @entity0 have a new hazard to worry about : a skyscraper whose reflected rays have the power to melt cars			1
it may sound like science fiction , but it was no joke for @entity13 owner @entity12 , who parked his pricey ride near the under - construction building , officially called 20 @entity16 , but known by many @entity17 as the " @entity18 " for its distinctive shape			1
watch more : does this skyscraper melt cars ? when he returned to the car , he found some panels warped beyond repair by the beam of light reflected down from the curved side of the landmark glass tower			1
the developers of the 37 - floor building , @entity31 and @entity32 , have said they 'll pay for the high - spec vehicle to be fixed			2
" @entity35 and @entity32 have been very good and agreed to pay for the damage , and accept that there is an issue which they will resolve , " @entity34 told @entity1			2
" i am in construction and sometimes things go wrong which nobody would have envisaged , and this is one of them			0
" the @entity46 newspaper said light reflected from the building had also previously damaged a van parked on the same street , eastcheap			1
a joint statement from @entity32 and @entity31 said they were taking the issue of light reflecting from the building seriously			1
" the phenomenon is caused by the current elevation of the sun in the sky			0
it currently lasts for approximately 2 hours per day , with initial modeling suggesting that it will be present for approximately 2 - 3 weeks , " it said			0
the developers have been in touch with local businesses and have arranged with local authorities for three parking spaces which may be affected to be suspended , it said			0
" in addition , we are consulting with local businesses and the @entity46 to address the issue in the short - term , while also evaluating longer - term solutions to ensure the issue can not recur in future			0
" 20 @entity16 , designed by architect @entity75 oly , will feature about 33,000 square meters of glass -- an area equivalent to more than 4.5 soccer pitches -- once complete			1
it 's not the only building reportedly to have directed scorching light onto the ground below			2
the @entity83 said in 2010 that the glass - sided @entity84 in @entity83 was reflecting a ray of light so intense that it scorched the hair of a visitor using the hotel 's pool , as well as melting a hole in a plastic bag he had by his sun lounger			1
hotel pool employees called the phenomenon the " @entity84 death ray , " the newspaper reported			0
a spokesman for the hotel 's owner told the paper it was working on design solutions			0
