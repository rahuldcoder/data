-- the @entity1 on friday promised a safer @entity3 food supply when it implements two new rules regulating food imported to the @entity3			1
the first rule would put the burden on @entity3 food importers to ensure their foreign suppliers are meeting @entity3 food safety standards			1
the second would establish provisions for certifying third - party auditors in these countries			0
" many of the most vulnerable commodities are coming from countries with less - mature systems in terms of regulatory oversight and farming practices , " @entity1 commissioner dr. @entity16 said			2
" this is an opportunity to help build regulatory capacity and improve safety standards			0
" the @entity1 will open the proposed regulations to public comment for a period of 120 days			2
it expects implementation of these changes to take two to three years			0
with 15 % of the @entity3 food supply coming from overseas , including 20 % of fresh vegetables and 50 % of fresh fruit , @entity16 said these regulations are long overdue			1
the most recent case of contaminated food involved pomegranate seeds from @entity38 ; as of wednesday , 153 people have been sickened by @entity40 after eating the seeds			0
" food - borne illnesses continue to take a great toll on @entity3 consumers , killing almost 3,000 people each year , " @entity16 said			0
" the health of our families is too important not to take the steps we 're announcing today			0
" the current food safety system in the @entity3 relies on @entity1 inspectors at ports of entry around the country physically inspecting food and detaining items that may pose a hazard to the @entity3 public			1
but inspectors can only physically examine 2 % of the nation 's incoming food supply , according to the agency , leaving the other 98 % unchecked			1
the best way to fill that gap , the government agency says , is to require importers to oversee their suppliers , and in turn , for @entity1 to oversee those importers			2
" these regulations represent a shift toward prevention and for industry being responsible for documenting what they have done to prevent problems from occurring , " said @entity69 , the @entity1 deputy commissioner for foods and veterinary medicine			2
the rules also propose a preferred vendor program of sorts , giving foreign food companies incentives to comply with @entity3 safety standards			1
" there will be opportunities to see their products move more swiftly ( through the import process ) if they have a record of compliance , " @entity16 said			0
" this will increase incentives for companies to fully comply			0
" food safety watchdog groups applauded the @entity1 's movement on the issue			1
" once finalized , the rules would ensure that foreign foods are held to the same high safety standards as @entity3 products , " the @entity97 wrote in a statement			2
" by holding overseas producers to @entity3 food safety standards , the new rules would establish a level playing field that would also benefit @entity3 businesses , farmers and food processors			1
" the @entity110 also said , " today 's long - delayed announcement that the @entity1 is moving forward on regulations to increase the safety of imported foods is good news and , if finalized , will lead to safer foods			1
supplier verification means that companies should know who they are buying from -- not just their name and address but their food safety practices			0
" the proposed rules come in response to the @entity125 , signed into law in january 2011			1
the act represented the first major changes in food safety policy in the @entity3 in more 70 years .			0

@entity1 proposes two new safety rules in response to the @entity125
