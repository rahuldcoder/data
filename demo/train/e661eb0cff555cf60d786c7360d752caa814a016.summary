-- as a social network and identity platform , @entity1 has had a lukewarm reception			1
but the service has had a pair of breakout features : hangouts and photos			1
@entity10 announced updates to both tools on tuesday in a @entity14 art gallery decorated in photos taken by @entity1 users			1
the company has spent the past two years forcefully pushing @entity1 into every nook and cranny of @entity10 products			1
it says there are now 540 million active @entity1 users across @entity10 , meaning they use some @entity1 - ified @entity10 product in some way or another			1
the number of people actually opening up @entity1 and checking out its stream of posts is lower , at 300 million visitors a month			2
for comparison , @entity31 has just more than 1 billion monthly active users			0
the problem with pictures one number that does pop out is the amount of photos people are sharing to the service			2
@entity10 says 1.5 billion photographs are uploaded every week			0
( @entity31 says it has about 2.4 billion a week , or 350 million a day			0
) digital photography and mobile devices with decent cameras have created a monster			0
people have thousands of photos , hours of videos , and not enough time to cut through the noise , edit and share images			1
" photography today is too hard , " said @entity10 senior vice president of engineering @entity51 at the press conference			0
" people have beautiful treasures that have become stranded in these devices			0
" @entity10 has been focusing on making tools that automate as much of the process as possible			0
hobbyists and professional photographers might enjoy carefully editing images , but average people just want to share their best vacation or family photos and move on			1
when you upload photos to @entity31 or @entity68 , the images are compressed			2
for the people who use social media as a kind of backup , this can be a disadvantage down the line when they want a higher - resolution version of their image			2
@entity1 is automatically uploading images at their full resolution , and soon the feature will come to @entity79			1
auto highlights , which was first was announced at the @entity81 , digs through all your images and picks out the best shots , eliminating duplicates , looking for sharpness and good exposures , and finding people it knows are important to you			2
the search feature has added thousands of new automatic tags like waterfall , sunset and beach , as well as less obvious categories like " hedgehog " and " manicure			0
" that means you can search for pics of your daughter @entity100 in front a waterfall wearing sunglasses ( and possibly holding a hedgehog ) and get the exact images that fit that description			0
there are also improved editing features , like auto - enhance , which can be toggled to high or low			1
if you agree with @entity10 's taste in photos and editing tweaks , it can save you hours of work			1
videos are even more labor - intensive than photos			2
the humbly named " @entity120 , " takes over in much the same way @entity118 's @entity117 automatically creates trailers			2
it can stabilize videos , sync the action with music tracks , add filters and edit clips together with minimal input from the user			0
" this is not some little local client editing system , " said @entity51			2
" this is the power of @entity10 -- of machine learning applied to photos and videos			0
" hangouts are for texting and @entity137 hangouts is @entity10 's communication tool that dabbles in chatting , video conferencing and live broadcasting			1
hangouts on @entity143 is popular for politicians and celebrities who want to broadcast a live chat			0
president @entity147 has done q&as using the tool in the past			0
@entity10 added features to schedule and promote @entity152 before they happen , more control for producers screening questions and moderating viewers , and auto - enhance features to improve video quality			1
video calls are now higher quality and can go fullscreen			0
if you 'd like to make your call look more like an @entity68 stream , you can add filters or auto - enhance			1
@entity166 , to fully cover all the communication options in chats , @entity10 is adding sms support so people can send text messages directly from the @entity173 app. most important , hangouts now support our most advanced method of communication , the animated @entity177			1
( it already allowed the second-most advanced method , the emoji			0

@entity1 is improving its photo editing features to cut down on time needed to share
hangouts are adding animated gifs , full screen video chats and auto - enhance for video
photos and hangouts are two of @entity1 's *biggest* breakout features
