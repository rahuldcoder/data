-- it was like @entity2 was on a runaway train of success			1
she had multiple best - selling books and was much in demand as a therapist and an inspirational speaker			1
and at one point in 2002 , she felt like she had given all she could give , and she suffered a meltdown			0
she detailed the struggles in her life and her recovery in her latest book , " seeking peace : chronicles of the worst buddhist in the @entity18			0
" and in the wake of that book , she is sounding an alarm about danger of being a joyless " constant working machine			0
" " if you ask anyone how they 've been any more , they always say , ' busy , ' " @entity2 said			1
" i 'm just stubborn enough that sometimes i say , ' you know , it 's been really slow for me lately , ' just to see people 's shocked looks , because nobody in @entity33 ever says that anymore			2
" @entity2 , the author of " @entity34 , " an acclaimed book that examined the stresses and perils young girls face , took some time off to heal herself by just sitting and enjoying simple things like birdwatching and viewing sunsets			1
now that she has slowed down , she 's noticed how so many adults are living at a fast pace despite their feelings of being burdened , anxious and confused			0
she also fears that her too - busy country has developed what she calls " a culture of anhedonia , " or the lack of ability to feel pleasure and joy			1
" people just are not laughing as much , " @entity2 said , adding that she rarely hears anyone walking around singing or whistling , like she did growing up			1
the psychologist says many people fault themselves for being too busy and think they just have to grab more control of their lives			1
women put too many expectations on themselves : having a career , being physically fit , being in good relationships with family and friends , reading good literature , doing community work , recycling and buying green , and being involved in some sort of spiritual quest			2
and when they fail to accomplish all that in one day , she said , " they go to sleep thinking , ' i did n't get done what i needed to , and somehow that is my fault			2
' " men are also heading down the path of feeling like a failure , as more of them share the " second shift " work of child care , cooking and cleaning at home			2
but the workplace has n't shifted much to accommodate men who are more involved in their families , @entity2 says			1
people 's efforts to squeeze so much more work into the unchanging number of hours in a day has caused them to abandon the mammalian rhythms that " we 've operated on since the beginning of the human race			1
" breaking those natural rhythms , @entity2 says , leads people to avoid eye contact as they tell themselves it might distract them from the busy and important work that they 've got to rush to do			1
also , moving too fast makes it difficult to see anything that is n't moving at the same speed , again leading to people not seeing each other			2
" that 's got to be some kind of enormous human tragedy on a cultural level , " she noted			2
" our time famine is actually diminishing the quality of the human experience in a very serious way			1
" our too - frenetic lives also dulls our senses , she says , leading us to " lose all capacity for joy , because joy comes from actually appreciating and being in the senses and being in the body			2
" @entity2 realizes that most people do n't have the ability or the money to take an extended leave , like she did for about three months			1
but she says there are other ways they can slow down			0
the author says she has become a " seeker of moments " : those times when you stop in your tracks and really pay attention to something beautiful or feel a connection to another person			0
she suggests ways others can capture such moments : take part in any daily practice that allows for stillness and quiet , such as meditation , sitting and drinking a cup of tea , stopping to watch a sunset or just lying in bed and being aware of your breathing for five minutes every morning before getting up			0
make a gratitude list at the end of the day to remind you where there was joy , or something spontaneous or fun during the day			0
choose to make human connections by looking directly into the eyes of the barista taking your latte order , your coworker or your child 's teacher or day care provider			0
set aside an area in your home -- a room or even a chair -- that is the quiet or calm spot			0
and any member of the family can go there and be undisturbed while they " deal with their own inner architecture for a little while			0
" turn off machines and live as close as possible to olden times by walking , talking or cooking with others			0
" dogs and cats move at the same speed in 2010 as they did in 1910 , " so there is a calmness in being with them , and they do n't care if you 're a high achiever or successful or well - paid .			0
