@entity0 -- the @entity3 captain who produced profanity - and slur - laden videos while second in charge of the @entity8 will be permanently relieved of his command of the ship , a top @entity3 commander said tuesday			1
the @entity3 will also investigate the role other senior officers played in the video scandal , adm. @entity14 , commander of the @entity15 , said			1
" while capt. honors ' performance as commanding officer of @entity8 has been without incident , his profound lack of good judgment and professionalism while previously serving as executive officer on @entity8 calls into question his character and completely undermines his credibility to continue to serve effectively in command , " @entity14 said , reading from a prepared statement			1
he did not take questions			0
honors will be replaced by capt. @entity32 , a former aircraft carrier commander who currently serves as chief of staff for the @entity34 , @entity14 said			1
honors has been reassigned to administrative duties with the @entity39 @entity38 command , @entity14 said			2
excerpts from the videos and descriptions of their content were first published saturday by @entity45 newspaper in @entity46 , @entity47			2
the videos on the paper 's website , reviewed by @entity1 , feature a man identified by two @entity3 officials and @entity45 as honors , who at the time was the executive officer , or second in command , of the aircraft carrier			1
he recently took command of the carrier , winning one of the most coveted assignments in the @entity3 , which has only 11 aircraft carriers			1
@entity64 said the videos , which were shown to the crew of the @entity8 while on deployment supporting the wars in @entity69 and @entity70 in 2006 and 2007 , are " inappropriate			1
" honors is shown cursing along with other members of his staff in an attempt to demonstrate humor , according to the videos			1
there are also anti-gay slurs , simulated sex acts , and what appear to be two female sailors in a shower together			0
the investigation was ordered friday by @entity14 , the four - star head of the @entity3 's @entity15 , after the videos were detailed in @entity45			1
the paper also posted a link to some of the material , but edited it so that expletives were censored and some identities of junior @entity3 crew were disguised			1
" after personally reviewing the videos created while serving as executive officer , i have lost confidence in @entity97 ' ability to lead effectively , and he is being held accountable for poor judgment and the inappropriate actions demonstrated in the videos that were created while he served as executive officer on @entity8 , " @entity14 said			1
@entity14 said that investigators will continue to examine the circumstances surrounding the production and distribution of the videos , which were shown to the @entity8 's 6,000 - member crew over a two - year stretch			1
he said the investigation will look at " the actions of other senior officers who knew of the videos and the actions they took in response			2
" the @entity118 said tuesday that defense secretary @entity119 knows about the bawdy videos but is leaving the fate of honors up to senior @entity3 leaders			1
" the @entity3 leadership is fully capable of handling this issue and taking appropriate action			2
it is not something that requires the secretary of defense , " col. @entity127 , @entity118 spokesman , told an off - camera question - and - answer session			0
" i do n't know if the secretary has been briefed on it			0
i know he is aware of it , " @entity127 said			0
he said @entity119 was not involved in the decision - making process over whether honors would remain in command of the @entity8			1
@entity1 left a message for @entity140 on saturday			0
the @entity45 said he did not respond to requests for comment			0
the @entity3 issued a statement saturday , saying , in part , " production of videos , like the ones produced four to five years ago on @entity8 and now being written about in the @entity45 , were not acceptable then and are still not acceptable in today 's @entity3			1
the @entity3 does not endorse or condone these kinds of actions			2
" the statement also said , " @entity15 has initiated an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the production of these videos ; however , it would be inappropriate to comment any further on the specifics of the investigation			2
" but the saturday statement was an about - face from the initial military statement to the newspaper			0
in that statement , the @entity3 said the videos were " not created with the intent to offend anyone			1
the videos were intended to be humorous skits focusing the crew 's attention on specific issues such as port visits , traffic safety , water conservation , ship cleanliness , etc. " @entity64 said senior officers had not yet seen the videos when they issued the first statement			1
it was after viewing them that the investigation was ordered , he said			0
when the videos first came to light the " leadership " of the @entity8 was " directed " to make certain future videos were appropriate , the @entity3 said			1
@entity64 said he was not aware if honors was ever reprimanded			0
in the videos , @entity140 repeatedly jokes that his superior officers were unaware of the content of the videos and " they should absolutely not be held accountable			2
" the @entity45 says the videos were shown over the ship 's internal broadcast system			2
@entity127 , while trying to avoid commenting directly on the @entity97 episode , defended how the military identifies and punishes inappropriate behavior			0
" while incidents like this , allegations like this draw a lot of attention , they are still relatively few and far between in terms of the millions of service members in service doing the right thing			0
and we have processes in place throughout the military services to handle actions that are inappropriate or rise to higher levels , " he said			0
" there are always going to be people who do things they should n't be doing and those people will be held accountable			0
the system works , " @entity127 said			0
the @entity8 videos , which include slurs against gays and lesbians , coincide with @entity118 preparations to implement last month 's congressional repeal of the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy that banned homosexuals from serving openly in the military			2
" those types of comments were inappropriate before the law was repealed , " @entity127 said			0
" there 's a service culture across all the services of treating everyone with dignity and respect , and inappropriate comments are n't acceptable at one point of time and unacceptable several months later because there has been a change in the law , " he added			0
@entity1 's @entity241 contributed to this report .			0
