-- ten years ago this month , i stood on the @entity3 floor as our nation 's leaders debated the first major anti-terrorism legislation after the tragic attacks of september 11			0
this legislation , which quickly passed @entity10 and became law , would allow the federal government , for the first time , to easily spy and collect data on innocent @entity15			1
this law , the poorly named @entity17 , and subsequent expansions of federal law enforcement power , would erode @entity15 's freedoms and waste precious resources			1
patriotism is about defending @entity15 's moral character and celebrating what makes this country great			2
unfortunately , this bad law did the exact opposite			0
i was an adviser to sen. @entity28 , @entity29 , the only senator who voted against that law			0
fear and anxiety was abundant in the halls of @entity10 in those early days and weeks , and understandably so			0
my colleagues and i had experienced two terror attacks in one month -- first the september 11 attacks and then the anthrax mailings that forced many @entity3 employees , including myself , to take potent medication for weeks and closed an entire @entity3 office building for three months while it was fumigated			0
@entity41 would be on edge for months to come			0
i know what it feels like to be worried about safety			0
but i also know that we lose when our nation changes its fundamental character , when neighbors no longer trust neighbors and when government wastes precious resources			0
that is why i want my government targeting actual threats , not innocent @entity15			1
during the last decade , @entity56 has found the @entity57 has increasingly focused its powers on law - abiding citizens , not based on criminal behavior , but based on race , ethnicity and religious or political beliefs			1
our report , @entity66 : the @entity74 " found , and the @entity75 has also reported , that the @entity57 targeted entire communities , specifically @entity68 , arabs , @entity70 and @entity71 , sowing fear and mistrust among all @entity15			1
so where are we 10 years later ? today , the @entity57 can show up at your work , unannounced , to interrogate you about an article on political events you post on @entity81 , or seize information about your phone calls , e-mails , internet activity and medical and banking records -- all without a shred of evidence that you 've engaged in criminal activity			1
government agents can stop and interrogate you at the border as you seek to re-enter the @entity15 , asking questions like " do you pray ? " " what mosque do you attend ? " or " why did you convert ? " donating $ 100 to a charity to help the needy can lead to questions simply because it is a @entity68 - run charity			1
today , it is difficult to find an @entity98 who has not had one of these encounters with law enforcement , or knows someone who has			0
but it 's not just the @entity68 community			0
journalists , professors , and anti-war activists have been targeted for surveillance , questioning and sometimes investigations by law enforcement based on their speech or political beliefs and activities			2
@entity115 is publicly known about the full scope of the @entity57 's activities			2
much of it is shrouded in secrecy			0
but we do know that , according to one former senior @entity57 counterterrorism official , the @entity57 conducted nearly 500,000 interviews of @entity68 and @entity124 males from 2001 - 2005 , and not a single one of those interviews led to information that would have allowed the government to detect or prevent the 9/11 attacks			1
think about that : for every hour an agent spent talking to someone who had nothing to do with terrorism , that was one hour less spent tracking down a real threat , in this case at least 500,000 hours in four years alone not spent on actual criminals			0
we also know that the @entity57 has trained its agents that growing a beard , frequently attending a mosque or wearing traditional @entity68 attire reveal extremism			2
this ignores that the 19 hijackers never grew beards or wore traditional @entity68 attire while in the @entity15 and that certain individuals , such as @entity147 and @entity148 , never frequented a mosque			2
the @entity57 should be focused on evidence of criminal activity , not targeting law - abiding @entity15			1
this is not the @entity15 our founders envisioned , and certainly not the beacon of liberty our nation aspires to be			2
@entity15 is at its best when we overcome fear and face our challenges together as one people , one nation			1
on this 10 - year anniversary of the @entity17 , it is time for @entity10 to act with courage			1
@entity10 should amend the law to require law enforcement to focus on actual threats , and should conduct a full public accounting of the use of the @entity17 and all federal surveillance powers that target @entity15 based on their race , faith or political ideology			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity177 .			0

@entity177 : @entity17 allows federal government to spy on innocent @entity15
for 10 years , she says , @entity57 has targeted citizens based on race , faith , and politics
@entity177 : @entity57 can question you about a @entity81 post , or spy on your emails , internet , records
act erodes freedoms , sows fear and mistrust , and needs to be changed , she says
