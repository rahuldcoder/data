-- @entity1 has rolled out an update to its search tool that makes it easier to find new people to follow			1
now , when you search for a given topic on the microblogging site , you 'll get suggestions of people and accounts that tweet about that topic			1
for instance , a search for " movies " yields @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and the @entity21 account under the " people results for movies " sidebar			0
you can get further suggestions by clicking on the " people " tab on the left - hand side search results where you can also browse recent tweets about the queried topic			2
in the movies example , further results include @entity33 , @entity35 - @entity34 and @entity36			0
previously , people results used a far simpler algorithm , showing people and accounts to follow based on keywords , the company said in a blog post			0
though a relatively small and obvious move , it 's yet another addition to @entity1 's web interface that makes third - party tools for performing the same task a little less relevant ( though the service has also been offering personalized follow suggestions for some time )			2
