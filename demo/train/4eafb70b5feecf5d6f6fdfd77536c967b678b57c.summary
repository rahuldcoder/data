-- after the surprisingly harsh response from some conservatives to my statement honoring president @entity5 , i replied last week with a question to his critics : what would you have done , in his place , faced with a crushing apartheid regime determined to eliminate all rights for your race ? @entity5 , i pointed out , was fighting for the same freedoms we in @entity18 defend most forcefully			1
those who do n't want to honor him seem to judge by a double standard			0
these critics on the right , however , are a relatively minor group			0
we heard no major conservative leaders or publications repeating their misguided claims			0
compare that with the crass manner in which the mainstream left has seized on @entity5 's death to smear @entity33 as having somehow " embraced " apartheid			1
many of the @entity5 remembrances have noted @entity33 's veto of economic sanctions against @entity39 as well as the @entity41 's addition of the @entity42 to the terrorist list -- saying this proves @entity33 supported apartheid			1
as someone who at the time was immersed in the debate over @entity39 as a member of @entity42 , i can attest that this is a slanderous mischaracterization of the @entity33 policy			2
@entity33 's chief concern in @entity39 was to prevent the country from falling to communism , a priority in line with his chief foreign policy goal worldwide			1
but @entity33 was also part of a new generation of conservatives who were committed to confronting apartheid after decades of what was frankly a disappointing lack of courage on the @entity18 right			1
a few dozen republicans in @entity42 , i among them , were some of the first conservatives to approach the problem seriously			0
the climax of our effort in the @entity72 was passing economic sanctions against @entity39			0
as many liberal commentators have noted in the past few days , @entity33 vetoed that bill , only to have @entity42 override his veto			2
but @entity33 's critics are wrong to say his opposition to economic sanctions made him pro-apartheid			1
he disagreed with our group of activist @entity66 in @entity42 over tactics , not over the aim of ending the institution			0
the president was absolutely committed to that goal , even if some of our other conservative colleagues were not			0
@entity33 " detested " apartheid , as he wrote in his diary and said publicly , but thought sanctions would be counterproductive to ending it			1
in particular , he believed punishing @entity39 economically would only have " hurt the very blacks we 're trying to help			0
" this was a position @entity33 shared with @entity95 , the head of the @entity96 , among other black @entity39			2
our disagreement over sanctions , as @entity33 said in his remarks after the veto override , " was not whether or not to oppose apartheid but , instead , how best to oppose it and how best to bring freedom to that troubled country			1
" @entity33 's veto of that bill , moreover , was not the sum total of his record on the issue			1
for one thing , as his former speechwriter @entity116 recalled last week , " @entity33 himself imposed sanctions against the @entity39 government , issuing an executive order that curtailed military and official relations between the @entity18 and @entity114			1
" these steps hurt the racist regime directly , not the poor majority			0
in addition to his own sanctions , one of the president 's first foreign policy steps was to send a close aide , @entity126 , to @entity39 to oppose apartheid			1
there , as four @entity33 biographers wrote recently in the @entity130 , " an unsmiling @entity126 told prime minister @entity131 to his face that the new president and administration ' abhorred apartheid , ' " and ended up walking out on him			2
@entity33 later appointed @entity135 as the first @entity18 black ambassador to @entity39 , a move that from the perspective of the apartheid regime was highly provocative			1
in fact , it infuriated @entity131			0
@entity135 later recounted that when he presented his credentials to the prime minister , the white @entity39 was shaking in anger			0
the only modern equivalent might be appointing a woman ambassador to @entity147			0
@entity33 was not silent about the imprisonment of @entity5 , either			1
he argued in a 1986 speech that " @entity5 should be released to participate in the country 's political process " and counted this step as a " necessary component of progress toward political peace			2
" this is not the record left - wing pundits looking to smear @entity33 have been presenting			2
there were too many @entity66 who were on the wrong side of the apartheid issue			0
despite those who are abusing the death of a peacemaker to indulge their hatred of another former president , @entity33 was not among them			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity169 .			0

@entity169 : a few conservatives *objected* to my *tribute* to @entity5
he replied asking what would they have done were they in @entity5 's shoes
liberals have wrongly said that @entity33 supported the apartheid regime
@entity184 : @entity33 opposed sanctions as a matter of tactics but was *anti-apartheid*
