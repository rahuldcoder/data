-- former rep. @entity1 and her husband @entity2 have launched what they hope will mark a new era in the battle over gun rights in @entity8			1
on the second anniversary of a mass shooting in @entity12 that wounded @entity1 and killed six others , the couple launched a political action committee , @entity15 , along with a website calling for contributions to help " encourage elected officials to stand up for solutions to prevent gun violence and protect responsible gun ownership			1
" in an op - ed in @entity24 , the two make their goal clear : to counter the influence of the gun lobby			1
" special interests purporting to represent gun owners but really advancing the interests of an ideological fringe have used big money and influence to cow @entity34 into submission , " they write			1
" rather than working to find the balance between our rights and the regulation of a dangerous product , these groups have cast simple protections for our communities as existential threats to individual liberties			0
rather than conducting a dialogue , they threaten those who divert from their orthodoxy with political extinction			2
" emphasizing that they support the @entity52 and own two guns themselves , @entity1 and @entity2 call for " laws to require responsible gun ownership and reduce gun violence			1
" " until now , the gun lobby 's political contributions , advertising and lobbying have dwarfed spending from anti-gun violence groups			1
with @entity15 engaging millions of people about ways to reduce gun violence and funding political activity nationwide , legislators will no longer have reason to fear the gun lobby			1
" @entity71 anti-gun ad marks anniversary of @entity12 shooting " @entity8 has seen an astounding 11 mass shootings since a madman used a semiautomatic pistol with an extended ammunition clip to shoot me and kill six others , " @entity1 writes			1
" this country is known for using its determination and ingenuity to solve problems , big and small ... but when it comes to protecting our communities from gun violence , we 're not even trying -- and for the worst of reasons			2
" @entity1 and @entity2 have spoken out in the wake of last month 's slaughter in @entity90 , @entity91 , that left 27 people murdered , 26 of them at @entity93 -- including 20 children			1
@entity1 wrote on @entity95 at the time , " as we mourn , we must sound a call for our leaders to stand up and do what is right			1
this time our response must consist of more than regret , sorrow , and condolence			0
the children of @entity93 and all victims of gun violence deserve leaders who have the courage to participate in a meaningful discussion about our gun laws -- and how they can be reformed and better enforced to prevent gun violence and death in @entity8			2
this can no longer wait			0
" @entity1 and @entity2 visited @entity90 last week			1
they met with local and state leaders to discuss gun control legislation , mental health identification and treatment , and " concerns for the erosion of our societal values such that we are increasingly desensitized to violence , " according to @entity90 first selectman @entity123			2
@entity1 told to ' stay out ' that visit also highlighted the intense political concerns surrounding such issues			1
@entity91 state rep. @entity128 , the state 's assistant @entity129 leader , posted a note on her @entity95 page saying , " @entity1 stay out of my towns ! " @entity128 later issued a statement apologizing , saying , " our community has struggled greatly through this tragedy , and we are all very sensitive to the potential for this event to be exploited for political purposes			1
this is what i wish to avoid			0
" the statement added that @entity128 has advocated for a dialogue on mental health issues , school safety and gun control			2
@entity2 , a former captain in the @entity149 and @entity150 astronaut , also responded publicly in the wake of the @entity90 shootings			1
on his @entity95 page , he took on the @entity154 -- the central pro-gun rights lobby -- after a news conference by a top @entity154 official about the @entity90 tragedy triggered widespread anger			2
@entity2 wrote that the @entity154 's response was " defiant and delayed , " and that the organization " chose narrow partisan concerns over the safety of our families and communities			1
" the @entity154 has argued that it is committed to keeping people protected , and that a focus on stricter gun control is misguided			2
" if it 's crazy to call for putting police and armed security in our schools to protect our children , then call me crazy , " @entity154 ceo @entity171 said of the anger following his initial news conference			0
@entity154 president @entity180 later told @entity0 the group supports schools choosing whether they want armed guards			0
@entity2 : ' good guys with guns ' are n't the whole answer @entity171 made clear his group believes that more guns , not fewer , are necessary for security			1
" the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun , " he said			2
@entity2 said he knows from personal experience that that 's not the case			1
the day @entity199 shot @entity1 and 18 other people at a public event in @entity202 , there was such a " good guy , " @entity2 argued in an interview with @entity205			1
a man came out " of the store next door and nearly shot the man who took down @entity199 , " @entity2 said			1
" the one who eventually wrestled ( @entity199 ) to the ground was almost killed himself by a good guy with a gun , so i do n't really buy that argument			2
" @entity1 and @entity2 want to require comprehensive background checks for private sales of firearms , @entity205 reported			1
and @entity2 said he does not believe an extended magazine is needed for those who have guns for sport			2
gunmen have used high - capacity weapons in numerous shootings , including one at a movie theater in @entity227 , @entity228 , and @entity90 , where gunman @entity229 had four weapons			0
sen. @entity231 , @entity232 - @entity233 , is pushing legislation to reinstate a ban on assault weapons			0
a @entity238 's passionate disagreement with @entity231 has garnered attention online			0
" i own the guns i own because i acknowledge mankind 's shortcomings instead of pretending like they do n't exist , " @entity240 wrote in a @entity241			0
" there are evil men in this world and there just may be a time when i need to do the unthinkable to protect me or my family			0
" @entity95 user @entity252 wrote in a @entity0 discussion that @entity1 and @entity2 's plan is " foolish " because " all gun bans are going to do is punish law abiding citizens for the actions of lunatics			1
" but @entity260 took the opposite stance			0
" no one is more qualified to head this effort , go @entity1 and @entity2 , " she wrote			1
@entity0 users weighed in on @entity265 as well , with @entity266 saying she considers the idea " crucial			0
" ' we ca n't be naive ' in their column tuesday , @entity1 and @entity2 note that that gun violence " kills more than 30,000 @entity8 annually			1
" according to the @entity273 , in 2009 , 31,347 people died from firearm injuries			0
nearly 60 % were a result of suicide			0
homicide comprised 37 % of those deaths			2
overall firearm injuries were down 2 % from the year before			0
@entity1 ' remarkable recovery after being shot in the head has inspired many across the political spectrum			1
she told @entity205 she 's doing physical therapy , yoga , and speech therapy , and working with a service dog			0
she has also been able to begin some outdoor activities			0
the tragedy two years ago thrust her and her husband into a new kind of spotlight			0
tuesday marks a moment in which they are turning all that focus and attention -- as well as their passionate calls for stricter gun control -- into a political movement			2
" we ca n't be naive about what it will take to achieve the most common - sense solutions , " they wrote in their op - ed. " we ca n't just hope that the last shooting tragedy will prevent the next			0
achieving reforms to reduce gun violence and prevent mass shootings will mean matching gun lobbyists in their reach and resources			2
" " we have experienced too much death and hurt to remain idle			0
our response to the @entity90 massacre must consist of more than regret , sorrow and condolence			0
the children of @entity93 and all victims of gun violence deserve fellow citizens and leaders who have the will to prevent gun violence in the future			0
" what do you think ? post comments , or send an @entity241			0
