-- @entity1 made history in the early ' 90s as the first national african - american late night tv talk show host			1
aimed at a hip , young demographic , " the @entity7 " was famous for its trademark " woof woof " audience chant and never - know - who - might - stop - by guest list			2
the show ran from 1989 to 1994 and boasted memorable moments , some of which have become a part of pop culture lore : @entity19 playing the saxophone during the ' 92 campaign ; @entity25 's first interview after being diagnosed with @entity26 ; and @entity1 's tense show the night the @entity23 riots broke out			1
on monday , nearly 20 years after his original run , the 57 - year - old entertainer heads back to tv with a new show , " @entity7			1
" where has he been ? how will he carve out his own niche in a very crowed late night field that includes @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 ? to paraphrase a certain someone , " these are the things that make us go ' hmm			1
' " @entity0 caught up with @entity1 at @entity45 's @entity44 on the set of the new show and got the inside scoop on his big return			1
@entity0 : what have you been up to since we last saw you on late - night tv ? @entity1 : i have been working hard in just a different element of life , trying to balance my own and do some things that are beyond show business and beyond rooms and ( studio ) lots like this			1
i left this business for something i did n't even know i was seeking			1
i just knew it was n't in my schedule from sun up to sun down in @entity45			2
i left the show for probably balancing my life -- i wanted my relationships to be different			1
i wanted to be with my family and my woman			1
it was a point where i felt i do n't want to leave this earth without a kid			2
there were a lot of things going on ... i want to do all those things that i wish my dad could have done with me			2
my mom and my dad worked very hard when i was young ; i was a latch - key kid			2
i not only wanted to have a kid ; i wanted to do it a certain way			2
once more , with feeling : where are the women in late - night tv ? @entity0 : how will your new show be different from your late - night competitors ? hall : the good thing about the second time around , there are people who know me , and those 35 - year - olds can tell their children , but i 'm about to jump back into the culture and i 'm the same @entity1 and i just give a different persona to a @entity97			1
some will love it , some will hate it			2
but you look for people to choose you because of the questions you ask , because of the bookings you have , because of the comedy you do ... you 're choosing what you want people to do with your public figures , your celebrities , your pop and hop stars			2
and everybody kind of knows what i do and how i do it , and i hope some people will join me for some nights			2
@entity0 : who 's on your wish list for guests ? hall : first of all , it 's been very complicated booking the first show because i had to decide what i wanted it to be			1
on that show , i just want a fun return , a party			1
no clips , no agendas , just friends and fun			2
and then the second night on , i 'll start to decide whether i need to talk to @entity129 and whether i can have that kind of interview			2
one of my dream guests , one of my dream shows , i do n't have to do this , it 's been done			1
when i was home , it was these kinds of things that drove me crazy and made me tell my son , is it time for daddy to go back to work yet , every week ? i was watching @entity37 , and he took his whole show on the roof of the @entity145 with @entity146 and @entity147 is that a show ? lord have mercy , that 's the kind of tv i like			1
@entity0 : will president @entity152 be stopping by ? hall : i do n't want to be arrogant , so i 'll give you the right answer			0
i will invite him , but he 's done a lot in late night			0
i got ta get real creative to figure out what to do			0
he 's slow - jammed the news , his wife 's done the ' @entity162			0
' maybe i 'll go back to basics , maybe i just do a straight interview			0
but the bottom line , yeah , he 'll be invited			0
@entity0 : any other dream guests ? hall : i called ( @entity19 ) and i said , do n't get nervous , i 'm not asking a favor from you			1
but would your wife come out with a saxophone ? that would be a move			0
if i walk out and then say , ooh one minute , grab a hand , and it 's @entity177 with a saxophone , it 's on			0
because that 's also a special statement if she do n't say nothing ... you know @entity177 ai n't gon na walk out with no saxophone			0
she might , but i said @entity19 would n't put on my sunglasses and play an @entity187 tune and wear my tie and bring his wife and let her join him , and he said yes to all of that			0
so sometimes i 've learned , ask			0
@entity0 : on your old show , you were n't afraid to tear up the script and get serious when the news of the day was serious -- for instance , the night the 1992 @entity23 riots broke out			1
will that be the case on the new show ? hall : i 'm a stand - up comic doing a @entity97			1
but what i like to do in moments like that is bring in a person like @entity205 as the musical guest , and you let @entity205 do a number , but you know when we put @entity205 on the couch , he 'll give us a respectable response to that kind of situation ... i 'm sure people , they want to be put to bed with a smile , but they also want me to touch on things that are going on			0
i 'm not bright enough to handle it but there are plenty of guests who can			1
@entity0 : you 've been off the air for nearly 20 years			0
how do you introduce yourself to a young audience that 's never seen the original show ? hall : after i knew i was coming back and @entity228 and @entity230 syndication had said yes it 's a go , i immediately started going on everything			1
i even wrote an article for @entity234 on fatherhood			0
i went on @entity236 , i went on @entity237 ( @entity238 ) , i went on @entity35 about 47 times , i went on @entity242 's @entity241 show and did a segment on the 20th anniversary of the riots by the way			1
i tried to get my face out there and doing everything			0
when ( @entity252 host ) @entity250 would take a vacation , i would call ( @entity252 host ) @entity255 and say y'all mind if i sit in for @entity250 ? and i 'll call @entity250 and say , if y'all cool with it			0
i was doing everything i could to get my face out and to show this town that i 'm still a viable talking head in late night			1
@entity0 : why come back now ? hall : it starts with your 13 - year - old asking you to drop him off about five blocks from the movie theaters or the party he 's going to			0
there 's a certain point where you realize you can moonwalk away from fatherhood just a little bit			0
and i sat down and had a conversation with him			0
because part of raising a kid -- to be a man , you have to see a man -- and part of raising a kid is to show him the other side of it too			1
i really love being a dad			0
but like last night , i fell asleep before he did with the remote in my hand			0
that 's what a young man needs to see too			0
hard work , tired .			0
