@entity0 are one step away from ending 23 years of painful @entity4 memories after sweeping aside @entity5 in the semifinals			1
the elephants have twice lost the final on penalties , in 2006 and 2012 , but could be on course for its first title since 1992 after a 3 - 1 success in @entity13 , @entity14			1
goals from two of its star players -- @entity19 and @entity20 -- were added to by @entity21 to seal a place in sunday 's showpiece			1
it signaled the end of @entity5 's fairytale run after it scored four goals in the final half an hour to defeat neighbors @entity5 in their last eight clash			2
@entity31 after a modest opening it was @entity0 talisman @entity19 who made the first decisive impact on the game , as he so often does for his club -- @entity38 champions @entity37			2
the 31 - year - old pounced on a loose ball after a run from teammate @entity42 -- signed by @entity37 in january -- to lash a fierce shot into the roof of the net			0
it was his 19th goal for @entity0 and must surely rank of one of his finest			0
but having got themselves in front , @entity0 switched off moments later to allow @entity5 back into the match			2
a looping cross from the right was handled by @entity55 , allowing @entity56 to register his third goal of the tournament from the penalty spot			0
the striker , who plays for @entity61 in @entity62 , should have put his side ahead 10 minutes later but failed to make proper contact with a cross that fell to him at the back post			0
it was to prove a costly miss. @entity0 immediately gained the upper hand and @entity20 saw his header diverted onto the crossbar by a brilliant @entity74 clearance			2
but the @entity76 midfielder was n't to be denied for long as an error in midfield saw @entity42 play him into the area , @entity20 slotting neatly into the far corner of the net			0
@entity5 came out revitalized after the break and @entity83 , who plys his trade with @entity85 in @entity87 's top flight , forced a fine save from @entity88 after a mazy run			0
but it proved to be only a brief flurry as @entity0 reasserted its control on the match			0
@entity20 and @entity19 both went close before defender @entity21 scored the vital third , knocking home from close range after @entity98 's header had been saved by goalkeeper @entity99			1
@entity99 made another save from @entity20 as @entity5 's desperate attempts to get back into the game left counter attacking gaps for @entity0			1
its players spilled onto the field to celebrate at the end of the match and they can now look forward to a clash in the final with either @entity111 or tournament hosts @entity14 , who play thursday .			1

@entity0 *cruises* into the @entity4 final after *victory* over @entity5
goals from @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 seals a 3 - 1 success in @entity13
@entity0 will face either @entity111 or hosts @entity14 in sunday 's final
