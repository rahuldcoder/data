@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 was no stranger to police			1
even before police caught up with him this weekend , @entity3 's record was well - established			1
he had gone to jail at least twice before on felony convictions			0
but -- if authorities are to be believed -- his time behind bars did n't prove much of a deterrent			0
authorities went after the 43 - year - old @entity3 this weekend in connection with the death of 19 - year - old @entity15 at a @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity1			1
not only did he confess to that killing , but police said @entity3 also admitted to six other women 's deaths			1
police said he led them to the women 's bodies in abandoned structures in @entity0 , @entity1			1
" it disgusts me , because it 's seven bodies , " said @entity26 , a resident of the @entity0 neighborhood where most of the victims were found			0
police : abandoned structures searched @entity3 had an initial court appearance related to @entity15 's killing on wednesday morning , but was held in contempt of court when he refused to answer the judge 's questions			1
@entity3 was represented by a state - appointed public defender , @entity38			1
there 's much more that 's not known publicly about @entity3 , in fact , than is known			2
like , what is his background ? what did he do for a living ? why -- if it is proven he killed these seven women -- would he do such a thing ? what is known that @entity3 was born in @entity1 but did n't stay there his whole life			1
records , for instance , show he was arrested on unspecified charges while living in @entity54 , @entity55 , in 1993			0
it was in the 1990s that @entity57 first got to know @entity3			0
@entity3 had married @entity57 's mother , who was about 30 years older than @entity3			0
@entity57 said he was n't comfortable or happy with his mother 's marriage , which lasted 16 years			0
part of it had to do with the age difference between the couple			0
then there were @entity57 's observations that @entity3 talked to himself or sometimes seemed lost in thought , in addition to stories he heard about @entity3 spending time in a rough part of @entity72 , @entity73 , where the pair had moved			1
" the guy is a nutcase			0
and i 'd watch him , " @entity57 told @entity2 's @entity77			0
" i 'd never allow him near my kids or in my home , because he just freaked me out			0
" @entity57 said things " went downhill " for @entity3 after he got fired from a temp agency , adding he had trouble finding good work after that			0
eventually , @entity3 and @entity57 's mother moved from @entity72 to @entity0 , @entity1 , where @entity57 said he found them " living in poverty			1
" @entity0 was where @entity3 had his first major brush with the law : in april 2004 , with a woman ( who was n't @entity57 's mother ) who police described as @entity3 's girlfriend			1
according to a police affidavit tied to that incident , @entity3 threatened to burn down or blow up the home of a man who he believed was sheltering his girlfriend			1
then , in front of police , he " grabbed ( his girlfriend ) and told the police to back up or he would burn himself and ( the girlfriend ) , " the affidavit stated			1
with his left arm around the woman 's neck and his right hand holding a gasoline can and lighter , @entity3 refused her requests for freedom -- right up until police grabbed and arrested him			1
@entity3 was charged with a class d felony , and spent 90 days behind bars after his conviction			1
at some point after his release , @entity3 went back to @entity72			2
that 's where , in december 2007 , he was arrested again , this time for aggravated sexual assault			1
according to the affidavit out of @entity124 , a 25 - year - old woman responding to " a service call from her employer " met @entity3 and the two went to an apartment			1
after they got inside , " @entity3 asked her if she was a police officer and she told him that she was not , " the affidavit said			2
" @entity3 then attacked her			0
" the court document details how @entity3 choked , repeatedly struck and raped the woman			2
a grand jury indicted him in july 2008			0
he pleaded guilty and was convicted in september 2009 and sentenced to five years in prison			0
that led to -- accounting for time served -- his release on july 5 , 2013 , according to @entity141 spokesman @entity140			0
again , @entity3 did n't stay put for long after getting out of jail			2
he registered as a sex offender in prison , then told officials there that he would move back to @entity0 , @entity1			1
@entity73 authorities alerted their colleagues in @entity149 , @entity1 , that @entity3 was to be considered a " low risk " sex offender , which is based on experts ' assessment of the likelihood that a person will commit another sexual offense			1
in the 15 months since @entity3 left @entity73 , police said , @entity3 killed seven women , with six of their bodies found in some of the estimated 10,000 abandoned structures in @entity0			1
there may have been more victims , police said			0
after @entity15 was found strangled in a @entity16 bathtub , authorities used cellular phone records to track down @entity3 on saturday , along with the blue jeep he 'd been driving			2
police said @entity3 also had @entity15 's pink phone and other potentially key pieces of evidence			2
police said @entity3 confessed , telling them he " messed up " and expressing surprise he had been found so quickly , hammond police chief @entity173 said			2
a short time later , he led authorities to the six other victims			0
authorities have not detailed what relationship , if any , @entity3 had with the victims			2
( in fact , police have only identified four of those killed so far			0
) as for why , @entity173 said , " i do n't have a specific reason he does this			0
" @entity3 's next court appearance is scheduled for october 29 at the @entity149 jail in @entity188			2
@entity2 's @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity196 contributed to this report .			0
