-- today 's heart - wrenching , baby - splitting @entity3 decision illegitimately rewrote the @entity4 in order to save it			1
it 's certainly gratifying that a majority on the court rejected the government 's dangerous assertion of power to require people to engage in economic activity in order to then regulate that activity			1
that vindicates everything that we who have been leading the constitutional challenge have been saying : the government can not regulate inactivity			2
it can not , as chief justice @entity24 put it in summarizing his opinion from the bench , regulate mere existence			0
justifying the individual mandate under the taxing power of @entity31 , however , in no way rehabilitates the government 's constitutional excesses			1
as justice @entity37 said in summarizing his four - justice dissent , " structure means liberty			0
" if @entity31 can avoid the @entity40 's structural limits simply by " taxing " anything it does n't like , its power is no more limited than it would be had it done so under the @entity45			1
opinion : health care victory , but still a long way to go while imposing new taxes may be politically unpopular and therefore harder to do than creating new regulations , that political check does not obviate constitutional ones -- and in any event , @entity31 had avoided even that political gauntlet here by explicitly structuring the individual mandate as a commercial regulation			1
nor does the @entity3 vindicate its constitutional legerdemain by rewriting the @entity60 expansion to tie only new federal funding to an acceptance of burdensome and fundamentally transformative regulations			0
while correct on its face -- and a good exposition of the spending power and what strings the federal government can attach to its funds -- that analysis is relevant to a hypothetical statute , not the one that @entity31 actually passed when it passed health care reform legislation			1
opinion : @entity74 lost ? the @entity3 punts moreover , allowing states to opt out of the new @entity60 regime while leaving the rest of @entity4 in place throws the insurance market into disarray , increases costs to individuals , and gives states a @entity84 -- different but no less tragic than the one it previously faced			0
as @entity37 wrote in dissent , while purporting to apply judicial modesty or restraint , the court 's rewriting of the law is anything but restrained or modest			0
in short , we have reaped the fruits of two poisonous trees of constitutional jurisprudence : on the one ( liberal activist ) hand , there are no judicially administrable limits on federal power			2
on the other ( conservative pacifist ) one , we must defer to @entity31 and presume ( or construe ) its legislation to be constitutional			0
it is that tired old framework -- with four justices in the former category and one in the latter -- that produced the @entity110 of today 's ruling			0
@entity112 : are voters ready to move on ? what judges should be doing instead is applying the @entity40 , no matter whether that leads to upholding or striking down legislation			1
and a correct application of the @entity40 inevitably rests on the @entity120 principles of ordered liberty and limited government that the document embodies			2
in any event , the ball now shifts to another court , that of the people -- the ultimate sovereigns who , in ratifying the @entity40 , delegated certain limited powers to the federal government			1
many have opposed @entity4 all along and it is they who must now decide -- or not -- to rein in the out - of - control government whose unconstitutional actions have taken us to the brink of economic disaster			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity141 .			2

@entity141 : @entity143 rejected notion that mandate justified under @entity45
but it justified it instead under taxation power ; this is constitutional excess , he says
he says in doing this , the court illegitimately rewrote the health reform act to save it
@entity141 : justices should be applying the @entity40 . to fix this , ball is now in voters ' court
