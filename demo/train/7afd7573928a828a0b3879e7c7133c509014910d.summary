-- in baseball - crazy @entity2 , where players are treated as celebrities , @entity1 is a superstar			1
a new giant of the game ? the 6ft 5 in @entity1 could soon be thrown a deal into the big time of @entity9			1
he 's been called the greatest pitcher in the country , but the relaxed 23 - year - old takes any pressure that comes his way , on and off the field , in his substantial stride			1
standing 6 feet 5 inches ( 196 centimeters ) he immediately stands out from most other players in the game and has added some extra color to the sport , as well as some peerless pitching			2
" i do n't really feel that much pressure , " he told @entity0			2
" instead , i 'm just happy to play the game here			2
i have a pride in being a baseball player			2
with poor results , i would feel responsible for it and feel embarrassed			2
i do n't want to become like that			2
so setting high standards for myself does n't cause frustrations			2
" he joined the @entity30 straight after @entity31 where he had been identified as the most promising player for many years			1
he was almost immediately thrust into the media spotlight as an 18 - year - old when he was photographed smoking a cigarette in a pachinko parlor			1
the media outcry that followed would have been comparable to a @entity39 @entity9 player caught in a doping scandal			1
with an @entity42 father and @entity2 mother , @entity1 had a different upbringing from most of his schoolmates			1
" i grew up in a different environment from the typical @entity2 family , " @entity1 said			1
" compared to them , we had quite different life			0
but my parents gave me the great influences and i am very grateful for that			0
" he remains in contact with his family heritage in @entity42 , organizing games in the country and sending over kits to youth teams			1
he has also helped to set up the @entity60 to help provide clean water to communities in developing countries			0
but mostly for @entity1 , " it 's baseball all the time			0
" he practices every day , even on days off , and has no problem living and breathing baseball			0
" baseball is a game where you can never predict what will happen next , " he said			0
" with great players , the sport creates drama			0
if you come to the stadium , you will soon understand how exciting baseball is			0
i wish everyone could see a game in @entity2			1
" @entity2 baseball players are expected to lead an exemplary life off the field , and while @entity1 was never the enfant - terrible of the game , he believes that marriage to actress @entity83 in 2007 has had a particularly positive effect on his life and his game			1
" my lifestyle became more stable after the marriage			0
marriage gave me many positive influences			0
if i 'm in a tight spot on the mound , i think of my wife and i think how sad she will be if i am batted down			0
this helps me to throw better , " he said			0
he maintains he 's happy playing in @entity2 , but he could be the next big thing from @entity2 to hit the @entity39 @entity9			1
rumors have circulated that the likes of the @entity96 and @entity97 are willing to pay the @entity30 millions of dollars just to talk about the prospect of signing him			1
the unflappable @entity1 refuses to play up the attention coming his way from the other side of the @entity102			0
" @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 and all the other @entity2 players are doing a great job in the @entity108			1
they really encourage me to become a better player			2
but i do n't particularly dream of playing in the major league or in the states now			0
" but if he produces more stellar performances he may well be living that dream , sooner rather than later .			0
