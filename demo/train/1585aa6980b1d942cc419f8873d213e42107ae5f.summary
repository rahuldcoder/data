the new measures include a more extensive list of prohibited conduct , independent investigative procedures , and specific criteria on paid leave for an individual charged with a violent crime			1

" @entity24 called the enhanced policy " significantly more robust , thorough and formal			1
" it applies to all @entity2 personnel , not just players			1
@entity35 , a spokesman for the @entity36 , said the union has not seen the new policy			2
" there will be a lot of analysis about the differences in our formal proposal and what the @entity2 will present today on personal conduct policy , " he tweeted before the league 's announcement			1
" sadly , those discussions will be through the media , not through formal negotiations , which the @entity2 has said they 're not interested in			2
" in a statement on its website , the players ' union said it was never offered the professional courtesy of seeing the new policy before it was announced publicly			2
the @entity57 said the @entity2 is missing a vital aspect in its policy			1
" the victim is an afterthought in this ' new ' policy -- as she was in the old policy , " now president @entity60 said in a written statement			0
" there is no guarantee that economic support will be there for as long as it takes for a victim to get back on her feet , and no indication that the @entity2 even understands that a six - game unpaid suspension could spark even higher level of violence			0
" a new conduct committee will include @entity79 owner @entity78 , @entity81 owner @entity80 , @entity83 owner @entity82 , @entity85 owner @entity84 and @entity87 owner @entity86			0
