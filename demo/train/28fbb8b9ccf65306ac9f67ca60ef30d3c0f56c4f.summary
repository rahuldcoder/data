both represent central @entity4 -- their districts share a border			1
both are recently elected to @entity8			0
both have outspoken positions on immigration reform			1
and that 's where the similarities end			0
@entity2 v. @entity2 rep. @entity16 , who represents @entity4 's 10th @entity17 , is actively lobbying his @entity2 colleagues to get on board behind immigration legislation that includes a path to legalization			1
" the entire system is broken , " @entity16 said in a recent interview with @entity24			0
" it 's a big issue for our nation			0
it is a big issue for @entity4 and for my home district			0
" but @entity16 's views do n't cross district lines			1
his congressional neighbor and fellow @entity2 , rep. @entity35 , could n't disagree more			1
while his 4th district is next to @entity16 's , a wide gap exists between the two on this issue			1
" we have a path to citizenship and it 's a path that has been followed by millions of legal immigrants who have obeyed all of our laws , " @entity35 said			1
" it 's unfair to have 11 to 20 million illegal immigrants cut in line ahead of them			1
" @entity16 was the first @entity2 to come out in favor of comprehensive legislation			1
he signed on to the @entity53 ' proposal , which includes a path to legalization for the 11 million undocumented immigrants currently in the country			1
it 's a controversial position within @entity2 circles			2
in his first week back in @entity60 after the holiday break , @entity16 got right to work			0
he met with 20 @entity2 members to hash out their differences on immigration			2
but @entity35 is working on his own immigration campaign			2
he vowed to " speak out at every opportunity " in opposition to a path to legalization			0
@entity70 : @entity71 at odds with himself on immigration @entity75 's haul @entity16 and @entity35 epitomize the challenge that lies before house speaker @entity75 regarding immigration reform -- a divided party with divergent views on immigration			1
the establishment and moderate components of the party want to overhaul the immigration system because it 's broken and because it would help a party unpopular with the fastest - growing segment of the population			0
meanwhile , conservatives know what 's popular with the base -- and in their district			0
the principles @entity75 unveiled at last week 's @entity2 retreat sought a middle ground -- a path to legalization but not citizenship , and only after those already in the country get in the back of the line and the federal government provides proof that work is continuing to secure the border			1
so close yet so far about 2½ million of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country are in @entity4			1
so how did two vocal @entity2 , both from central @entity4 , emerge with such different positions ? their districts help tell the story			1
@entity35 represents a predominately @entity2 district , which overwhelmingly voted for @entity2 presidential candidate @entity112 in the 2012 election			1
his district is 78 % white and wealthy , with residents earning a median income of more than $ 61,000 per year			0
@entity117 , @entity118 associate professor of ethnic studies , describes @entity35 's district as the " white flight " district , meaning that wealthier , older , white residents move to the @entity125 suburbs or @entity126 to retire or get away from congested urban areas			2
" there are n't that many districts like that in @entity4 , " @entity117 said of the profile of @entity35 's district , which allows him to have a conservative , anti-immigration position			1
@entity16 's district , which is adjacent to @entity35 's , is so close in proximity yet so far in ideology			1
@entity16 represents " the nation 's salad bowl , " an agriculture mecca that supplies much of the country 's produce			2
forty percent of the residents are @entity143 and only 47 % voted for @entity112			0
@entity35 and @entity16 " reflect the complex topography of @entity4 , but at the same time , their positions are reflected in their constituents , " @entity117 said			1
re-election at stake while @entity35 coasted to victory , @entity16 had a tough re-election bid 2012 and could have another tough race against a @entity153 in 2014 , a threat that could be compounded if @entity2 fail to act			1
@entity16 's constituents are very aware			2
many of them are agriculture workers , and they and their families are directly impacted by any action -- or inaction -- on immigration			0
" i 've seen it in my own home district where families have been torn apart , " @entity16 said , describing the current maze of immigration laws and enforcement			2
once fearing deportation , immigrant among first lady 's guests @entity2 leaders are acutely aware , acknowledging that the party must address the issue to prevent becoming irrelevant as @entity175 and @entity176 grow to a larger percentage of the electorate			2
but in a deeply divided @entity8 , with more than 200 safe republicans , immigration is hardly worth upsetting the base			0
@entity35 says his view is in line with his constituents '			0
" i can tell you the sentiment in my district is very strongly for the rule of law and assuring that those who come to our country come with the intention of becoming @entity193 , " he said			0
a difficult race for @entity35 is much more likely from a primary challenger than from a @entity153			0
@entity196 , executive director of @entity197 , a group that favors a reduction of immigration , said @entity35 is more in line with @entity2 voters ' views			1
" i think the majority of @entity2 understand that their constituents do not want this and ca n't afford this , " she added			0
special interest support @entity208 said @entity2 leaders are being pushed by business groups who want institutionalized cheap labor			0
the @entity213 has been active , pushing republicans to get on board with immigration reform			1
like the national @entity213 , the @entity4 outpost has sent letters to the @entity4 delegation , held news conferences and lobbied @entity8			0
" this is so important to @entity4 's economy			2
this is more important here than anywhere else , " @entity224 president and ceo @entity223 said in july			0
" ( @entity4 's representatives ) ca n't let somebody else , who does n't have a stake in this , determine the outcome			2
" but giving @entity35 cover , however , is the local chapter of the @entity213			0
@entity236 , ceo of the @entity237 , located in @entity4 's 4th district , says immigration is n't a priority for county residents			1
" if the federal government would enforce existing law , we would n't have the problems we currently have , " @entity236 said , a position that @entity35 echoes			0
work in @entity60 while @entity16 might be a minority in his caucus , that minority might have the momentum			2
states take the lead in immigration game @entity255 majority leader @entity254 has been advocating his @entity257 proposal to address the status of children of parents who came to the country illegally			0
and @entity75 unveiled @entity2 principles last week , an indication that he is testing the waters on possibly moving an immigration bill this year			1
@entity16 called discussions at the @entity2 retreat productive and said he 's pleased that @entity75 floated a starting point			1
he 's trying to convince @entity35 and like - minded @entity2 that the @entity193 has " de facto amnesty " and that the @entity2 should " fix the system			1
" @entity35 does n't seem likely to buy it			0
" the @entity2 has always stood for the rule of law and it has welcomed legal immigrants to the country with the desire to come and be @entity193 and i believe we should continue to do so , " he said			2
the tale of two @entity2 will have an ending			0
it 's just unclear what it will be .			0
