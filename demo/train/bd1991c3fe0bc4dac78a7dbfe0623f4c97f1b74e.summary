, as a record where " anything goes and you just got ta believe it will make sense			2
" but it is n't the record he set out to make			2
" i wanted to make something more religious , " he says			0
" i just did n't have enough [ religious songs ]			1
intentionally , specifically religious songs is what i wanted to do			1
that takes a lot more concentration to pull that off 10 times with the same thread -- than it does with a record like i ended up with			0
" the " anything goes " album he ended up with is full of big stories , big endings and transfixing effect			1
the disc was recorded in @entity30 's studio in @entity31 with @entity1 's touring band -- bassist @entity34 , drummer @entity33 , steel guitarist @entity35 , and guitarists @entity36 and @entity38 -- as well as @entity39 on guitar , violin and accordion			1
" @entity49 " is a devastating tale of a man in search of his lost love ; the doleful " @entity8 " seems to be about love ( but maybe it 's revenge ) ; the vengeful " @entity8 " has @entity1 darkly repeating , " i pay in blood , but not my own			1
" @entity50 finally seals @entity8 , in " @entity51 , @entity52 , " @entity1 's heartfelt tribute to his friend @entity53			1
the title track is a nearly 14 - minute depiction of the titanic disaster			1
numerous folk and gospel songs gave accounts of the event , including the @entity63 's " @entity62 , " which @entity1 drew from			1
" i was just fooling with that one night , " he says			0
" i liked that melody -- i liked it a lot			0
' maybe i 'm gon na appropriate this melody			0
' but where would i go with it ? " elements of @entity1 's vision of the @entity62 are familiar -- historical figures , the inescapable finality			1
but it 's not all grounded in fact : the ship 's decks are places of madness ( " brother rose up against brother			1
they fought and slaughtered each other " ) , and even @entity84 appears			0
( " yeah , @entity84 , " says @entity1			1
" i do n't think the song would be the same without him			0
" ) " people are going to say , ' well , it 's not very truthful , ' " says @entity1			1
" but a songwriter does n't care about what 's truthful			2
what he cares about is what should 've happened , what could 've happened			0
that 's its own kind of truth			2
it 's like people who read @entity101 plays , but they never see a @entity101 play			2
i think they just use his name			0
" @entity1 's mention of @entity101 raises a question			1
the playwright 's final work was called " @entity110 , " and some have already asked : is @entity1 's " tempest " intended as a last work by the now 71 - year - old artist ? @entity1 is dismissive of the suggestion			1
" @entity101 's last play was called ' @entity110			2
' it was n't called just plain ' tempest			0
' the name of my record is just plain ' tempest			0
' it 's two different titles			2
