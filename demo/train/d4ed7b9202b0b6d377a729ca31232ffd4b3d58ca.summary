@entity0 -- phone hacking was widespread at the @entity4 newspaper when @entity5 was its editor , a former employee testified wednesday , stopping just short of saying @entity5 definitely knew about it			1
@entity7 said that he " can not prove " that @entity5 knew about illegal eavesdropping , but that it was " very unlikely he did not know what was going on			1
" phone hacking " happened every day " at the @entity4 's show business desk in late 1999 , @entity7 told the @entity12 , a wide - ranging government - backed investigation of @entity16 press ethics and practices			1
also on wednesday , @entity21 's ex-wife @entity20 accused @entity5 of using her as a " scapegoat			1
" @entity5 , who now hosts the @entity1 talk show " @entity24 , " testified the previous day that he did not believe phone hacking had taken place when he was editor of the tabloid			1
speaking by video link , @entity5 tenaciously defended himself against accusations that he knew more about phone hacking than he has admitted in the past			1
some of the toughest questioning focused on a story based on a voice message @entity21 left for his then - wife @entity20 , trying to make up after a quarrel and singing to her			1
@entity5 refused to say who played the message for him or where , but admitted under sustained questioning that he believed it was a voice mail			1
" did you know that was unethical ? " demanded @entity42 , the lead lawyer for the inquiry			0
" not unethical , no. it does n't necessarily follow that it was unethical , " @entity5 said			1
@entity47 appeared to try to shoot down speculation that she herself had played the recording for @entity5 , after judge @entity52 said only she could legally have given permission for him to hear it and threatened to call her to give evidence			2
" i can categorically state that i have never ever played @entity5 a tape of any kind , never mind a voice message from my ex-husband , " she said on her website			2
" @entity5 has no additional comments re : the @entity12 or @entity20			2
his written statement and the complete transcript from the @entity12 can be found online , " wrote a representative			0
in august , @entity20 told the @entity65 that a journalist working for a @entity68 publication admitted hacking her voice mail			0
she said a senior @entity68 journalist phoned her and " started quoting verbatim the messages from my machine			0
" she said she replied : " you 've obviously hacked my phone and if you do anything with this story ... i 'll go to the police			0
" the journalist responded : " ok , ok , yeah , we did hear it on your voice messages , i wo n't run it , " according to @entity20			0
on wednesday , former @entity5 employee @entity7 painted a picture of the editor as deeply involved in the daily workings of the paper he edited from 1995 to 2004 , comparing the editor to late @entity90 leader @entity89			1
@entity5 " was the ' @entity89			2
' it was all about him , " @entity7 said			2
" nothing that happened on that desk happened without @entity5 knowing about it , " @entity7 said of the show business desk			1
a lawyer for @entity68 , which publishes the @entity4 , said the company disputed @entity7 's testimony and would go into more detail at a future session of the inquiry			1
in the past , @entity5 has vigorously denied ordering phone hacking at any point during his career			1
he struck pre-emptively at @entity105 on tuesday , pointing out that the journalist had gone to prison over a stock tip scandal and saying he would not be a reliable witness			0
@entity5 was investigated over the stock tip scandal but not charged or convicted of any crime			2
also on tuesday , @entity42 , the inquiry lawyer , repeatedly tried to use @entity5 's own words against him to show he knew more about hacking than he admitted , citing his books and interviews in print and on the radio			1
@entity5 , at times clipped and at times testy , deflected line after line of inquiry , saying the quotes did not mean what @entity42 implied they did			2
the @entity12 was prompted by public and political outrage at the revelation that another tabloid , @entity126 's @entity125 , hacked into the phone of a missing teenage girl who later turned out to have been murdered			0
@entity126 's son @entity129 ordered the best - selling paper closed over the scandal			2
much of the inquiry -- and a related police investigation -- focus on allegations of phone hacking by the @entity125			0
the publisher of the paper , @entity137 , announced tuesday that a subsidiary had settled with seven people who accused @entity126 's newspapers of phone hacking			1
the claimants included @entity143 , who was a lover of @entity144 , @entity144 , and other @entity16 celebrities			0
the newspaper group " has agreed to pay appropriate sums by way of compensation and costs and have expressed regret for the distress caused , " @entity137 said in a statement			0
the company settled earlier this year with " @entity155 " actress @entity156 and a handful of other claimants , but other lawsuits against the newspaper group are outstanding			0
testimony by former staff of @entity125 and @entity137 last week focused on how much @entity137 chief executive @entity163 knew about hacking by his employees			0
police say notebooks seized from a private investigator working for @entity125 contain the names of about 5,800 potential victims of phone hacking			0
the process involves calling a cell phone and entering a personal identification number to access voice messages			0
@entity1 's @entity175 contributed to this report .			0
