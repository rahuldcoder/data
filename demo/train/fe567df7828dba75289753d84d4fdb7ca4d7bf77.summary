@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 beat @entity4 4 - 3 in a frenetic @entity5 on sunday which @entity3 manager @entity6 described as the " best derby of all time			1
" at the @entity11 and @entity12 matches , the atmosphere can swell to boiling point			1
but while the @entity16 derby certainly stirs the passions , @entity14 has scoured the world to select 10 other local match ups which stir the emotion of the club 's faithful			1
do you agree with our selection ? tell us about one you think should make the top 10 in our sound off box below			2
1 ) celtic v rangers -- @entity31 , @entity32 these two are the bitterest of bitter rivals			1
not only are they divided by football , but by religion as well , with @entity38 taking their support from the @entity41 community and @entity42 the @entity44 community			1
the hostility has become so intense that both clubs have asked their fans to stop singing the sectarian songs that had become commonplace on match days			2
to add fuel to the fire , they are consistently the only two teams who challenge for the @entity32 title , with the make - up of the @entity5 ensuring they face each other four times in a season , not including cups			1
despite both clubs attracting some top foreign stars , the helter - skelter nature of the fixture has not been diluted over time , as confirmed by the number of dismissals over the years			1
2 ) @entity67 v @entity66 -- @entity68 , @entity69 undoubtedly the fiercest derby match in @entity69 , these two rivals really hate each other			2
violence in and around the @entity74 between the sets of supporters , and the police , has become an all - too - common occurrence in recent seasons			2
both teams hate the perceived arrogance from the @entity83 cities ( @entity84 , @entity85 ) -- but they loathe each other more			2
@entity67 take their support from a traditional working - class fan base , while @entity66 's support tends to come from the wealthier districts			1
the historical political differences between the fans is another reason for this rivalry			0
@entity66 's supporters , in general , followed right - wing ideals while the @entity67 fans leaned more to the left			1
3 ) @entity12 v @entity11 -- @entity98 , @entity99 although by no means the most " local " derby in @entity102 ( the clubs are about 7km apart ) , it is undeniably the most intense			1
the rivalry , hatred and violence involved are based on social class and money			0
both clubs were founded in the poor district of @entity98 called @entity111 , but @entity11 moved to a wealthier area called @entity113 in the 1930s , heightening the animosity between the clubs			1
@entity12 ' stadium is known as " @entity118 " ( @entity119 ) because of its layout			1
the steep stands and the lack of a running track makes for a particularly intimidating atmosphere			0
4 ) @entity126 v @entity125 -- @entity127 , @entity128 arguably @entity131 's most passionate derby , this match brings together two of the continent 's most successful clubs			1
their rivalry is so strong that foreign referees are always brought in for the derby games and , following a number of violent incidents , matches between the two have been moved to the 75,000 capacity @entity141			1
on the pitch , @entity126 currently have the upper hand , winning the last four league titles			1
5 ) @entity146 v @entity147 -- @entity148 , @entity149 the @entity150 separates the city of @entity148 into a @entity153 side and an @entity155 side			0
@entity146 , on the @entity153 side , have traditionally been the wealthier of the two clubs , while @entity147 , on the @entity155 side , have a largely working - class following			2
however , in recent years , @entity147 have attracted a number of wealthy fans who have pumped money into the club , thus unbalancing the equilibrium			0
nowadays , there is nothing to choose between them on and off the pitch			0
the last five league titles have alternated between the two clubs and both clubs have won 17 @entity149 championships			0
6 ) @entity172 v @entity171 -- @entity173 , @entity174 this is the derby between the two giants of @entity174 football , although the rivalry between the two also exists in basketball , @entity174 's national sport			1
in the past , @entity172 , from the port area of @entity182 , used to represent the working class , while @entity171 represented the upper - class suburbs of @entity173			2
nowadays , the situation has evened out			0
however , on the pitch , @entity172 are the dominant club , having won 11 of the last 12 league titles , including the last four in a row			0
7 ) @entity190 v @entity189 -- @entity191 , @entity192 this is a relatively new fixture : both clubs were founded in 1945 , but what they lack in age , they make up for in passion			0
@entity189 was founded as the football section of the central club of the @entity200 , while @entity190 was founded as the civilians ' club			0
@entity190 , or @entity203 as they are now known , have traditionally been the more successful , achieving the ultimate of winning the @entity205 in 1991			0
8 ) @entity207 v raja -- @entity208 , @entity209 these two are the biggest clubs in @entity209 and violence between the fans often mars these fixtures			0
@entity207 used to dominate honors , but in recent seasons @entity216 have enjoyed more success			0
@entity216 means " hope " and @entity207 means " love , " although there is certainly no love between the rivals when they face each other ! 9 ) palmeiras v @entity226 -- @entity227 , @entity228 another derby that has been going for nearly 100 years			1
@entity226 used to be the only club in the city , but a group of @entity69 members broke away to form @entity234 , earning the nickname of the " betrayers " by @entity226 fans			0
@entity238 is the biggest stadium in @entity227 and all the derbies are played there , although the @entity242 stadium , which hosts many @entity226 matches , is also used for the occasion			0
10 ) @entity246 v @entity245 -- @entity247 , @entity248 one of the oldest derby matches in the world , with both clubs being formed in the 1890s			2
the two most honored clubs in @entity248 , they share a remarkable 85 @entity248 league titles and eight @entity257 championships between them			0
the derby is always played in the @entity259 , with a capacity of almost 74,000 , although @entity245 also have their own ground in a different neighborhood of the city			2
