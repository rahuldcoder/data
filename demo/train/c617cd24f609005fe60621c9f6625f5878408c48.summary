@entity2 @entity1 ' @entity0 said thursday that @entity4 was " never in danger " from a plot by a @entity7 citizen to attack the @entity8 , but that officials are still monitoring the situation			1
in an email obtained by @entity3 that was sent to all @entity14 members and staff , sergeant at @entity17 says that " law enforcement was diligent from the onset and the @entity20 was able to quickly identify the threat , investigate , and make an arrest			2
" " the public , and in particular the @entity4 community , was never in danger during the investigation			0
the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) remains in close coordination with the @entity20 and my office continues to monitor the situation , " @entity27 writes			0
" we will keep you informed of any important developments that may arise			0
" @entity27 also urges the @entity8 community to " maintain vigilance and security awareness at all times			0
" " i know you have heard it before , but it bears repeating today : if you see something , say something , " he adds			0
the email comes just the day after the @entity20 successfully foiled a plot to attack the @entity8 that was being developed by @entity45 , a 20 - year - old @entity46 who was allegedly inspired by @entity47			1
the incident is the latest to highlight the threat posed by radicalized young men used by terrorist groups to carry out attacks in their own countries			1
the terrorists in @entity55 last week became increasingly radicalized while in prison before traveling to @entity57 , where at least one met with the @entity7 jihadist @entity59 , a notorious @entity60 cleric			1
the brothers ' travel to @entity57 and intelligence reports that one also traveled to @entity64 turned the @entity66 's worst fears — foreign fighters returning to the @entity66 to carry out attacks — into a grisly reality			0
and @entity70 sen. @entity69 , a member of the @entity72 's intelligence and armed services committee , said on thursday echoed intelligence assessments that " lone wolf " terrorists are the " toughest " threat to counter			1
" the real weapons of mass destruction today are unemployed 22 - year - olds who fall for this radical ideology and we 've got to figure out how to counter that , " he said on @entity3 's " @entity78			1
" sen. @entity69 on torture report : ' this is not @entity7 ' but he disagreed with his @entity89 colleagues , most notably sen. @entity90 ( @entity91 ) , who argue that the @entity7 needs to ramp up its military effort against @entity47 and other terrorist organizations			1
" we 've been in the stamping out business for the last 12 or 13 years and it has n't worked all that well , " @entity69 said			0
" part of the problem is the more we , the @entity7 and the @entity66 , are active — particularly with troops on the ground — the more it becomes a recruiting tool for the extremists			0
" instead , @entity69 said the @entity7 needs to address what he called a " deeper question " : figuring out how the @entity7 can combat the radical ideology spread increasingly online by extremists like @entity47 and @entity60			1
@entity69 pointed to a program being developed in the @entity109 , where officials are working to " de-radicalize or anti-radicalize " their prisons , which can be hotbeds of extremist recruitment			1
even @entity47 , which now controls swaths of territory in @entity116 and @entity64 and seeks to inspire the lone wolf attacks @entity7 officials are most concerned about , was reportedly formed from an @entity7 military prison in @entity116 , @entity120 , according to @entity121			1
there , @entity122 met the men who would years later become the branches of @entity47 's senior leadership			2
@entity69 stood firm against calls from @entity90 and other @entity89 hawks like freshman sen. @entity129 ( @entity130 ) who are calling on president @entity131 to escalate the military fight against @entity47			1
and @entity7 troops certainly should n't be the ones " rooting them ( @entity47 ) out door to door in @entity137 , " a city @entity47 captured in @entity116			2
related : @entity129 on terror threat : ' we have to win on offense ' " we are not going to be able to take them out by killing them one at a time			0
it 's not going to work , " @entity69 said			2
" we 've got to go deeper than just police , @entity20 , @entity145 and military			2
we 've got to talk about how do we stop this movement toward radicalization because otherwise this is going to be a 100 - year war			1
" @entity131 and @entity109 prime minister @entity151 made it clear in an opinion piece published thursday that they are closely watching the threat of lone wolfs , vowing not to be " cowed by extremists , " whether they come in the shape of terrorist groups or " lone fanatics			0
" reacting to the foiled @entity46 plot in an interview with @entity166 , potential 2016 @entity89 presidential candidate @entity163 gov. @entity162 made a quick connection between terrorism and border security , one of his top issues			2
@entity162 said there is " very good intelligence " that the south @entity163 border with @entity175 could allow " individuals " to come into this country			0
" @entity7 will sleep better knowing that their government is actual doing their constitutional duty , " @entity162 said .			0

after an @entity46 man 's alleged @entity47 - inspired plot was foiled by the @entity20 , @entity69 says the @entity7 needs to counter radicalization
more than just ramping up the @entity7 military effort , @entity69 pointed to " unemployed 22 - year - olds " as the *greatest* threat
@entity69 's comments also come after the @entity191 terror attacks , carried out by young men who were radicalized in prison
