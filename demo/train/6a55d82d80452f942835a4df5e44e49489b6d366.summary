-- mechanical problems aboard @entity4 's new @entity3 airliner seem to be happening far too often for some			1
" they transport people , you , me , our loved ones ... i think some of the strategies ( how fast they are built and how thoroughly they are tested ) should be more carefully examined , " wrote @entity0 commenter @entity11			2
the @entity15 is worried , too			1
on wednesday , the @entity15 announced plans to ground @entity18 - registered @entity17 until they pass an emergency airworthiness inspection addressing the potential risk of battery fire			1
the @entity23 government also ordered them out of service , and other nations where 787s were in service have followed suit			1
@entity30 is the only @entity18 carrier operating the 787 , with six @entity17 since september , the growing list of reported troubles aboard the @entity3 include a fuel leak , an oil leak , two cracked engines , a damaged cockpit window and a battery problem			1
@entity15 grounds @entity17 in the most serious incident so far , a battery alarm prompted an emergency landing in @entity23 on wednesday of an @entity42 carrying 129 passengers			1
those on board reported a burning smell in the cabin , officials said , and the alarm indicated smoke in a forward electrical compartment			0
a few hours later , @entity42 and @entity53 airlines announced they were grounding their @entity17 pending an investigation			0
the incident comes about a week after the @entity15 announced a broad safety review of the aircraft			1
related : @entity23 carriers ground 787s consumer concerns are legitimate and understandable , say airline safety and engineering experts , but most of the troubles are relatively minor			1
however , they say , if the @entity3 has a battery system design problem , that would raise larger concerns			1
lithium ion batteries " any time you 've got smoke or fire or odor of smoke and fire on an aircraft , that 's a very serious situation , " said @entity68 , a veteran airline pilot and head of the @entity70			1
" you 've got very little time to get an aircraft on the ground safely if something like that occurs in flight			0
" the batteries are critical to the plane because the 787 is thirsty for electrical power			1
the @entity3 uses electricity to run more systems than any other @entity4 airliner , said @entity94 professor @entity93 , an aircraft electrical and computer engineer who spent time observing @entity3 development at @entity4 's @entity98 headquarters			1
it takes lots of battery power to run electricity through those systems			2
the 787 is unique because its batteries are lithium ion batteries			1
the batteries hold more energy for longer periods than the standard nickel cadmium airliner batteries			2
" these kinds of batteries , " @entity93 says , " are slightly more likely to cause problems			2
" it 's unclear whether the @entity3 battery trouble in @entity23 was a charging problem or a battery overheating problem , says @entity117 , a former airline mechanic and former member of the @entity119			1
a charging problem would n't require an immediate landing , " but if i had a battery overheating -- given the history -- i 'd be looking for the nearest place to put my butt on the ground			2
" cracked engines and windshields , oil and fuel leaks other problems linked to the @entity3 -- such as oil and fuel leaks or damaged cockpit windows -- are operational issues that occur aboard " every airliner out there flying today , " says @entity68			1
" it just so happens that this aircraft is under such intense scrutiny			0
" for an oil leak in flight , a pilot responds depending on how much oil is leaking			0
" if it 's a problem , you 've got procedures to either put the engine in idle and land the aircraft or continue and monitor the amount of oil on board until you reach your destination			2
" " fuel leaks -- whether they happen in the wing or near the engine or near the fuel tank area , those happen every day			0
" when mechanical problems occur , pilots rely on what 's known as the @entity158 -- an electronic checklist for troubleshooting			2
" one guy flies while the other guy fixes , and then you make a decision , " says @entity161 , a 13 - year airline pilot			0
@entity161 remembers a problem aboard his aircraft in 2004 when a passenger looking out a window spotted a minor fuel leak near the wing			0
after referring to the checklist , @entity161 diverted the airliner and landed in nearby @entity173 , @entity174 , as a precaution			0
another time , a crack appeared in @entity161 's cockpit windshield			2
" it was a complete nonevent , " he says			0
the flight continued to its scheduled destination			0
" windshields crack all the time , " says @entity117			0
measuring inches thick and multilayered , airliner windshields are designed to take a beating from weather and the occasional bird			0
the cracked engines reported on @entity17 in 2012 were likely isolated incidents , @entity93 says			0
as for random window cracks and fuel and oil leaks , @entity4 can solve these kinds of problems without much difficulty , he says			1
worldwide , @entity17 fly 150 flights daily , @entity4 said last week			2
in a statement released wednesday , @entity4 reacted to the @entity15 grounding			1
" we are confident the 787 is safe and we stand behind its overall integrity			2
we will be taking every necessary step in the coming days to assure our customers and the traveling public of the 787 's safety and to return the airplanes to service , " said @entity4 chairman , president and ceo @entity201			1
" i still would get on the airplane , " @entity68 says			0
it may be the most watched airliner in the world now			0
" that airplane is being looked at so closely both before and after every flight that it borders on the ridiculous			0
" " now , i guess people should be a little concerned , " says @entity93			0
but bottom line , he says , " i 'd fly it			0

new : @entity15 grounds all @entity18 *dreamliners* over battery fire concern
@entity4 : " we will be taking every necessary step "
after @entity23 grounded the 787 , experts worry most about @entity3 's lithium ion batteries
