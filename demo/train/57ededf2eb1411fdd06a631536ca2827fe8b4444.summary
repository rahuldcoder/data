-- @entity1 has enjoyed an astonishing season -- but the @entity4 wing wizard faces a nervous wait to find out whether he will be back in action any time soon			1
@entity7 star @entity1 injured his right ankle while going in for a challenge with @entity11 's @entity10 on a frustrating night for the home team as it came from two goals down to rescue a 2 - 2 draw in the first leg of its @entity18 quarterfinal			1
the 23 - year - old has enjoyed an outstanding season , scoring 22 goals in 38 appearances for a @entity7 side chasing a place in next season 's @entity25			1
" it should n't be as bad as it looks on the image , " manager @entity27 told the @entity28 after still television pictures had shown a painful looking blow			0
" there is a big , big possibility if we stay positive that he will be fit for the @entity38 game ( on april 21 ) and it will only take him out of two games			0
" " we still have a big squad and the ability to adapt ( without @entity1 )			1
" we just have to play against @entity42 ( at the weekend ) and see when these players get back to make us even stronger			0
" @entity1 's injury capped a frustrating night for @entity7 , which failed to produce the kind of performance its fans had been expected			1
not since 1984 has the club won a @entity50 trophy -- on that occasion it defeated @entity52 over two legs to win the now defunct @entity18			2
but any thoughts supporters might have had of reaching the final in @entity57 were well and truly shattered as @entity11 started at breakneck speed			2
@entity60 champion @entity11 , which knocked @entity61 out of the @entity25 in 2011 , grabbed a 30th minute lead when @entity63 fired home from close range after @entity67 's effort had hit the post			1
with @entity69 stunned into silence , @entity11 took full advantage with @entity72 heading home just four minutes later			2
@entity7 , currently third in the @entity74 , hit back before the break when @entity76 poked home with @entity79 's deflected effort ensuring the game finished level			1
across @entity83 , @entity82 scored twice as @entity84 claimed a 3 - 1 win over @entity87 side @entity86 at @entity88			1
the @entity92 striker , wearing a face mask to protect his broken nose , opened the scoring on 16 minutes before @entity94 added a second to give @entity96 's men a measure of control			2
@entity100 's penalty reduced the arrears , but @entity82 plundered another goal after the break to seal the win			1
" it 's good for his confidence , " @entity96 told @entity105 following @entity82 ' double			1
" his work - rate was really good			2
i 'm pleased for him			0
i have said before , he 's training well			2
it was a question of time			0
" he scored two goals today and hopefully it will be the same in the next game			2
" elsewhere , @entity120 came from a goal down to claim a 3 - 1 win over @entity123 at @entity124			1
@entity123 grabbed a 12th minute lead through @entity126 and almost extended its advantage further only for the same player 's strike to crash against the post			1
@entity120 hit back when @entity131 lashed home from close - range following a mistake by @entity123 goalkeeper @entity135			1
but the visitor continued to threaten and the post once again denied @entity126 much to the frustration of manager @entity139			0
that frustration was increased when a defensive error by @entity142 allowed @entity143 to fire @entity120 in front with 25 minutes remaining before @entity145 rounded off the scoring from the penalty spot			2
" if we 'd taken 2 - 1 you 'd like to think we 'd have a fantastic chance but it 's an uphill chance now , " @entity139 told @entity148			1
" i think the away goal could come into it if we get the first goal ( in the second leg )			0
if we can get the first goal we only need one more			0
" they are a quality side and we have to give them respect , but we showed tonight if we are ambitious we can hurt a team			0
" in @entity163 , @entity162 scored twice in the final 12 minutes to claim a 2 - 0 win over @entity166 side @entity165			1
@entity167 and @entity168 were both on target for the home side in @entity172 , which proved too strong for a @entity165 team forced to play with 10 - men after @entity175 was shown the red card three minutes after the break			1
meanwhile , @entity178 confirmed it has lodged a formal complaint with @entity18 following the performance of @entity182 referee @entity181 during tuesday 's 2 - 2 @entity25 draw at @entity184			1
the @entity186 leader was unhappy that the official failed to stop play during the quarterfinal first leg tie while @entity190 and @entity191 were both left prostrate following a collision in the penalty area			0
" the club has written to @entity18 due to a series of incidents on the pitch in the understanding that objectively speaking it was evident that the referee did not apply the rules of the game , " @entity178 spokesman @entity195 told a news conference thursday			0
" when two players from the same team are on the floor the referee should stop the match , which did not happen			0
" what 's more he then obliged them to leave the pitch , in contravention of the rules			2
" an incident that is sufficiently serious in a competition like the @entity25 to bring to @entity18 's attention so that it does not happen again			0
" @entity178 also made public its annoyance at the failure of the officials to rule out @entity220 's strike , which came with the forward in an offside position			0
the @entity224 's 79th minute effort , which made the score 1 - 1 , was fiercely contested by the @entity178 players			1
" we are fully conscious of the possibility of errors in refereeing and we do not consider ourselves badly treated , " @entity195 said			0
" but it surprises us that in a high - level competition a referee does not know the rules			0
" we are not judging the work of referees but the basic principle that a judge should know the law			0
we hope it does not happen again			0

@entity7 's @entity1 suffered ankle injury in 2 - 2 draw with @entity11
@entity82 scored twice as @entity84 defeated @entity86 3 - 1
@entity120 came from behind to see off @entity123 3 - 1 in @entity246
@entity162 late show ensured 2 - 0 *triumph* over @entity165
