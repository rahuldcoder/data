-- @entity1 was two years out of college and facing one of the biggest decisions of her young life : what to do with those @entity8 friend requests from people she met through her job			1
blurring work and personal friendships is prompting @entity1 to maintain separate @entity8 pages			1
" there 's nothing on my personal page that 's horrible , " says the 24 - year - old communications coordinator for the @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17			1
" it 's just that there are some things that are not work - appropriate			1
" many of the job - related friend requests came after meeting people at conferences			1
eventually they would find her by searching on @entity8 and request to be " friended			1
" @entity30 decided to ignore the requests			2
after all , does a virtual stranger really care what her favorite movies are ? do they really benefit from learning details about her weekend leisure time ? @entity30 's answer was to create a second @entity8 page , which she devotes to work - related information			1
this means she now has her " friend friends , " about 400 of them , and then she has her " work friends , " four , so far			1
@entity30 's modern dilemma is becoming more common throughout the world , experts say , as friendships with co-workers extend to our lives spent online after work hours			2
simultaneously , our computer time at the office is becoming an extension of our personal life , they say			1
' work takes place in more places now ' this is n't necessarily a bad thing , says @entity65 , professor of communication and media studies at @entity67 in @entity68			2
" no one ever forces us to go online -- we can shut it off , " he says			0
" what this is really all about is an increase in information sharing			0
" and with the popularity of smartphones and other handheld devices , many people carry their work into their homes and are never separated from e-mail			0
they also have the ability to stay in constant touch with their favorite social networking sites			1
" there is increasingly less difference in work life and personal time , " @entity86 says			1
" we are coming from a time when there were very clear boundaries			0
that comes from an older expectation			0
work takes place in more places now			0
" and again , @entity86 does n't think it 's a bad thing to have access to all this information about work and co-workers			0
@entity30 , who has friended her manager but not her big boss , says she likes to think her co-workers are sensible enough not to put out too much information -- especially photographs -- on social networking sites			2
and so far , so good			0
there have been no embarrassing images of drunken escapades , no status updates erupting with emotional outbursts			0
social networking sites have both good and bad uses in the business world , says dr. @entity119 , a clinical psychologist and adjunct faculty member at @entity121			2
face time vs. @entity8 time people can use the sites to make new acquaintances outside their departments and groups , and users can extend their networks beyond the traditional workplace , she says in an interview by e-mail			1
" it 's a way to enter new professional galaxies			0
" but people can use the sites too much and as a consequence give less time to meeting with co-workers in person			0
" in most businesses , it 's optimal to mix social networking with real - life face - to - face interaction , " she writes			1
" however , social networking can provide a springboard for identifying kindred spirits with whom one might want to do something old - fashioned like , say , having a cup of coffee			2
in an ideal world , it 's best to relate to others in both cyber and real space			0
" @entity159 , a psychologist who practices in @entity160 , says you need to be careful to make sure that social networking sites are n't encroaching on your office time			1
more than an hour a day is excessive , she warns			2
worse , spending too much time on the sites can disrupt your balance between work and private time			2
it can also take you out of your family time with your spouse or children			0
" if you are spending two hours at home on them each night , you are not available to your family , " she says			0
set boundaries both psychologists advise setting boundaries between yourself and the people you work with , as well as your online " friends			1
" @entity119 also suggests setting goals for using social networking sites and telling others about your limits to avoid hurt feelings			1
she uses an example of someone who lets people know , " i do n't do those things at nights or on weekends so i can have my time with family			0
" and @entity193 says to consider who you 're corresponding with during your work time			0
if they are n't people you would talk to in " real life , " she says , you probably are wasting time .			0

do job - related @entity8 friends really need to know details of your personal life ?
@entity8 user decided to separate her " friend friends " and her " work friends "
expert : more than one hour per day on social sites is too much
set goals for how you use sites and make your friends *aware* of them
