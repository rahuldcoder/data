-- your passive - aggressive aunt bought you a @entity4 subscription for @entity5			1
while your first impulse was to hit her with a brick , you 've always been curious about online dating			1
" what the heck ? " you figure			2
" i 'll write an ad and take a look around			0
" but when you 're on your own in virtual reality , the search for computer - generated love can be daunting			1
here are the top online dating types to avoid			1
torso tosser : this dude is super proud of his abs -- or at least the photo of @entity26 's abs that he 's pretending are his -- yet he refuses to show his face			1
this means one of three things : he 's married , otherwise engaged , and / or does n't want his wife 's / girlfriend 's friends busting him cheating			1
or maybe he 's unapologetically searching for someone to have a purely physical relationship with and wants a woman who feels the same way ( which is fine , but do n't expect flowers or romance from this guy )			1
the other possibility ? his face is so hideous , it would melt a camera lens			0
whichever the case may be : next ! @entity45 : he 's " tired of the bar scene , " does n't like " game - players , " never met a " long walk on the beach " that he did n't enjoy or a sunset that did n't make him weep with joy			1
he firmly believes beautiful flowers grow from stinky cow dung and is as comfortable in a worn pair of jeans as he is in a tuxedo			0
if you 're ok with spending an evening with someone whose idea of wooing you is advising you to make lemonade out of his lemons , you 're a match made in heaven			0
otherwise , keep on clicking			0
carpet bomber : these guys are n't looking for someone special			0
they 're looking for someone			0
they cast a wide net , sending out winks and notes to anything remotely female in their path			0
consequently , their messages tend to read as if they 've been written by a dull - witted robot : dear [ @entity81 ] , you are a beautiful lady that i want to know better			2
please meet me for coffee or cocktails			0
looking forward to your response			0
@entity87 @entity88 fan : the kind of guy who lists " @entity94 " as his favorite book is telling you something			1
he probably works in finance			0
the last book he read was " @entity94 " and that was in ninth grade when we all had to read it			1
he 's likely a selfish jerk who 's overly concerned with buck - making and under - concerned with anyone who 's less fortunate than himself			1
@entity108 ! finicky freak : even though he 's 45 , he 's only interested in women between 18 and 27			2
miss @entity112 must possess naturally red hair ( shoulder length or longer , please ) and a full c - cup			2
he 's somewhat flexible with his height requirement -- as long as you 're between 5 feet 6 inches and 6 feet -- but you absolutely can not weigh over 110 pounds , regardless of your height			1
if you want to be his girlfriend / doormat , you must have at least a @entity122 -- preferably an @entity123 -- but not a @entity125 ( because that would mean you 're smarter than him )			2
you must enjoy working out ( often ) , skipping meals , and laughing at his ( no doubt humor - free ) jokes			2
run in the other direction			0

steer clear of these duds in the online dating pool , author urges
@entity139 who posts *pix* of his abs : either he 's married , or wants *sex* - only relationship
the ads that are so general they *attract* anyone -- because that 's who he dates
" @entity94 " fan is overly concerned with making money
