@entity0 -- president @entity3 's campaign to punish corrupt @entity5 officials has hit its biggest target			1
@entity7 , 71 , who used to be one of the most powerful @entity10 politicians in @entity5 is now under investigation for corruption			1
for now , it is an intra-party investigation , a first step down a path that could lead to a criminal trial			0
the questions remain : will @entity7 's case be handed over to the criminal courts ? will there be a public trial ? many @entity5 watchers knew this was coming			1
there had been rumors that @entity7 and his followers were being investigated			2
in fact , hundreds of senior party officials , state - company managers , and minister - level bureaucrats have been charged or are under investigation			2
many of them are @entity7 's @entity35 © s , political allies , and close relatives			1
we 've seen a spate of anti-corruption purges since @entity3 came to power in 2012			0
but surely @entity7 is the most senior party official to be put under investigation , even though he 's now retired			1
before he formally stepped down from his government posts in march 2013 , he was in charge of @entity5 's security apparatus -- the police , the courts , the prosecutors , and the secret dossiers			1
the fact that the announcement of @entity7 's investigation did not make a huge destabilizing impact in @entity5 shows that the public has been prepared for it , or the public has been made to believe that corruption is so pervasive amongst senior part officials that it is no longer shocking			1
possible fallout corruption is a scourge in many countries , but it is especially rampant in @entity5			2
@entity10 leaders have often acknowledged that corruption is so endemic that , in @entity3 's words , " corruption could lead to the collapse of @entity69 [ @entity10 ] and the downfall of the @entity71 [ @entity5 ]			1
" some 182,000 officials were disciplined in 2013 , while courts nationwide tried 23,000 corruption cases , according to the @entity10 's disciplinary commission			2
by targeting @entity7 , @entity3 is showing his resolve to target not only " flies " ( minor officials ) but also " tigers " ( senior officials )			1
@entity3 is also breaking an unwritten rule that no member of the politburo standing committee , current or retired , is to be prosecuted			0
he 's trying to show that there is no sacred cow that will be spared of punishment			0
but the question is : what will be the fallout ? one possible scenario would be the destabilizing effect within the @entity10 , especially among senior officials who may think they could be the next targets			1
is this move politically motivated simply to get rid of @entity3 's real or potential political enemies , and if so , could that trigger panic or destabilization within the @entity10 leadership ? another fallout of the anti-corruption campaign is amongst ordinary @entity5			1
while the campaign is popular amongst the masses in general , some @entity5 are feeling hurt by it			1
some are complaining that many fringe benefits that they used to get on the grassroots level -- such as annual bonuses , occasional dole - outs of foodstuff , group working meals -- have now been suspended by local officials who are afraid of being accused of misusing funds as these are grey - area expenses , or public expenditures			0
one local official in @entity0 told me that even civil servants like him are complaining about this : " unless we are given legitimate salary increases , we are losing out to inflation and to undistributed fringe benefits			0
our standard of living is slipping , and we are losing badly if this goes on longer			0
" these are just some of the unintended consequences of an otherwise popularly supported anti-corruption campaign			1
the " sunshine law " of course , the biggest casualty of the ongoing campaign is the reputation of the @entity10			0
put simply , the party 's image is tarnished with each case lodged against a high - profile official			2
will these periodic hunts for " flies " and " tigers " fundamentally clean up @entity5 of graft and corruption ? some analysts inside and outside @entity5 doubt it			1
they believe that unless and until @entity3 pushes for systemic reform of the political and social system , corruption will remain endemic			0
such a reform , they say , would entail measures that will institutionalize transparency and accountability within the system , including the @entity10 , the government , in business , and in people 's daily lives			2
they believe that , for example , much of the official graft can be curbed if @entity5 can institute a system whereby the salaries , assets , and liabilities of officials -- and their spouses and children -- are declared every year and are made public			1
since the 1990s , @entity5 has been deliberating drafts of a so - called " sunshine law " precisely to achieve that goal			2
some provinces and a few ministries have reportedly been following such a system on a " pilot " basis			0
but over the years , such disclosures have been kept within the @entity10 , with no public access , which defeats the purpose			0
true reform another institutional change needed is an independent judiciary and an independent anti-corruption body , which can dispense justice fairly , free from control and interference of the @entity10 and other vested interests			1
otherwise , the @entity10 will remain the accuser , investigator , prosecutor and judge , rolled into one			0
just as important , @entity5 needs to have a robust and independent media that can scrutinize officials ' behavior and blow the whistle when they sniff corruption			1
some are already doing that , but at the risk of official retribution or censorship			0
@entity5 must encourage and protect the whistleblowers , instead of intimidating or jailing them			2
all these measures can help create an institutionalized " check - and - balance " to curb corruption			0
the @entity202 met a few days ago to put forth its collective approval for the decision to investigate @entity7			0
the group also decided that the 350 - strong @entity206 will meet in @entity0 in october			0
at the top of the agenda is how to promote the rule of law			0
and that shows the quest for a clean @entity5 government and a clean @entity10 that is governed by the rule of law , remains a work in progress .			0

@entity7 became the most senior official to be *ensnared* in @entity5 's anti-corruption campaign
are other senior officials worried that they may become the next target ?
true reform will take a lot more than laying graft charges on *individuals*
