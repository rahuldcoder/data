-- a one - time @entity3 - based @entity2 group can not sue the government over claims it was targeted by the government 's once - secret @entity6 , a federal court has ruled			2
the @entity10 - based 9th @entity9 on tuesday unanimously tossed out a lawsuit by the now - closed @entity12			1
the federal government had listed the @entity16 , @entity15 , chapter as a supporter of terrorism in 2004			0
the group sued , saying its private overseas communications were unconstitutionally being monitored under the @entity23 administration 's warrantless wiretap program			1
that spy program was unveiled in a 2005 @entity26 article that said government officials were working with private telecom companies to secretly monitor telephone and e-mail traffic of targeted individuals and groups , both domestic and international			1
federal officials later publicly acknowledged the existence of the program , which was then officially authorized by @entity36 in 2008			2
" this case effectively brings to an end the plaintiffs ' ongoing attempts to hold the @entity42 responsible for intercepting telephone conversations without judicial authorization , " said the appeals court			1
the decision overturns a federal judge 's earlier award of more than $ 2.5 million to attorneys working for @entity12			0
at issue was whether the federal government was liable from such suits			0
the @entity23 administration in 2008 had separately granted the telecom companies " retroactive immunity " from any lawsuits			0
the appeals court said @entity36 had never waived immunity for government officials over alleged state eavesdropping , even if constitutional rights were violated as a result of improper government conduct			1
" @entity12 can bring a suit for damages against the @entity3 for use of the collected information , but can not bring suit against the government for collection of the information itself , " the court concluded			1
" although such a structure may seem anomalous and even unfair , the policy judgment is one for @entity36 , not the courts			0
" the @entity2 foundation said two of its @entity3 - based lawyers had their telephone conversations with clients in @entity80 secretly monitored , without a judge 's prior approval			0
lawyers for the group said they were in a @entity85 , unable to prove the government used the information from the wiretaps against @entity12 , after the government cited national security and state secrets			2
while ruling for the government , the appeals court sharply criticized @entity95 lawyers who had claimed in court papers the plaintiffs were engaged in " game - playing " by continuing their lawsuit for years			1
" in light of the complex , ever - evolving nature of this litigation , and considering the significant infringement on individual liberties that would occur if the @entity42 were to disregard congressionally - mandated procedures for obtaining judicial authorization of international wiretaps , the charge of ' game - playing ' lobbed by the government is as careless as it is inaccurate , " said judge @entity100 , writing on behalf of her two colleagues			0
the case is @entity12 v. @entity115 ( no. 11 - 15468 ) .			0

@entity12 said its overseas communications were *illegally* monitored
@entity9 said @entity36 never waived immunity for government officials
