@entity0 -- @entity0 are not especially known for their patience			1
stand on a subway escalator 's left side -- otherwise known as the passing lane -- and it might evoke a sharp reprimand from fellow riders			2
but in the aftermath of @entity14 , millions across the @entity0 metropolitan region who depend on the nation 's busiest transit system are still waiting for their subway system to be fully restored			1
" there is no precedent for this , " said @entity17 , author of " @entity18 : the @entity22 and how they transformed @entity0			2
" dubbed @entity0 's " life - blood , " an estimated 5.5 million people ride the city 's subway system each day in the country 's most densely populated region			1
most @entity0 residents do n't have cars to fall back on			2
less than half own cars , according to the @entity32 , which cites the latest census data on car ownership			0
that 's a stark contrast with the rest of the nation , where 92 % of all households own at least one car			0
opinion : @entity0 infrastructure fail so when @entity43 launched into emergency mode this week ahead of @entity14 , shutting down all of its 468 stations for the second time ever , the effect was crippling on commuters and the places they work			1
at a corner @entity50 market , where the @entity53 bustle continued in spite of @entity14 , @entity55 , 49 , struggled to fill scheduling gaps left by stranded employees despite his own commute from storm - battered @entity60			1
" i 've got employees coming in from all across the tri-state area , " he said			0
" it 's been really hard for them to get in , almost impossible			0
i 've been coming in at 6 a.m. everyday and leaving at 10 p.m. just to help out			0
" dating back to 1904 , @entity0 's century - old subway system is so extensive that if it were laid out in a single line , the tracks would extend from @entity53 to @entity71			1
defending it and the city 's power grid from storms that whip along @entity0 's low - lying neighborhoods could be a concern that gains momentum beyond the week 's recovery effort			1
" we going to have to find some long - term , or longer - term solutions to this , " mayor @entity80 told reporters this week			0
could giant plugs prevent subway floods ? and yet there were some indications that this kind of crisis was coming			0
just 14 months ago , @entity92 prompted @entity0 's first - ever total subway closure			1
" rising sea level and climate change are likely to cause dangerous flooding in the coming decades , " according to a 2004 report produced by the @entity98 for @entity0 's @entity99			1
that report said much of the region is less than three meters above sea level -- which is slowly rising -- and therefore at risk from a so - called " 100 - year flood , " a term often used to describe its relative probability			2
@entity0 " has a 100 - year flood every two years now , " gov. @entity106 quipped this week to president @entity107 , who briefly cut off campaign stops to tour the region and assess the billions of dollars in damages along @entity0 and @entity60 's coastal plains			1
" our climate is changing , " the mayor wrote in an editorial this week			0
" and while the increase in extreme weather we have experienced in @entity0 and around the world may or may not be the result of it , the risk that it might be -- given this week 's devastation -- should compel all elected leaders to take immediate action			1
" broader questions about climate change , infrastructure and how cities like @entity0 will respond to storms like @entity14 will likely continue to loom large			1
" @entity0 might have to take the @entity134 model , where they have all their power systems elevated , " said @entity130 , a professor of public policy at @entity132			2
opinion : @entity0 has what it takes to rebound " this is really not just a @entity0 problem , it 's a problem that exists in many places			1
" the @entity134 flood protection model employs large - scale flood gates , as well as a series of low - lying drainage canals and pumping stations			0
in @entity149 , engineers have devised a $ 3 billion system called a " @entity151 " that essentially works as a floodwater diversion facility to protect @entity154 's 13 million residents during rain and typhoon season			1
still , making @entity0 's subways watertight would be an " engineering feat equal to the scale and creativity of the original construction ( of the system itself ) , " said @entity163 , @entity0 's former transportation commissioner and lecturer at @entity166			1
" our engineers are up to it , if given the resources and the free hand			0
" in the days ahead , @entity0 faces at least two big challenges , according to @entity173 , senior climate scientist at @entity166			2
first , the city must cope with its immediate problems -- power outages , stranded residents , suspended subway lines , flooding and fire damage			2
then it needs to deal with long - term infrastructure			0
" we need to be innovative , " said @entity173			0
" and we should consider things like putting up flood gates at the mouth of the @entity186 ( @entity187 ) and other vulnerable points that could help hold back the tide			0
" an army of municipal workers and private contractors is addressing the more immediate concerns , working around the clock in @entity0 to pump out sea water and wipe down salt - caked machinery like underground transformers , circuit switches and generators			2
as workers scrambled to restore equipment , thousands of otherwise stranded commuters defiantly walked to work this week , often abandoning taxi cabs in the city 's traffic - clogged streets			0
" i left my house at 6:45 a.m. and i 'm still walking , " said @entity206 , a 40 - year - old @entity207 resident who crossed the @entity208 at around 10 a.m. " i do n't know what ( else ) to do			0
i have to get to work			0
" @entity0 's buses , trains and subways are all slowly coming back online			1
but for many residents across the region where full transit service has yet to be restored , the slog to work continues			0
in the end , @entity0 marathon did n't feel right			2

an estimated 5.5 million people ride @entity0 's subway system each day
@entity0 shut down all 468 subway stations for the second time ever for @entity14
if it were laid out in a single line , the tracks would extend from @entity53 to @entity71 , @entity230
