-- as we well know , @entity1 is recruiting angry young men as far afield as @entity4 and @entity5			1
the allure is much like the allure of a street gang -- in part , because @entity1 looks an awful lot like a street gang			1
gangs have long been understood as a collective response or " solution " to the strains encountered by their respective members			1
for some youth , @entity1 has become the " solution			2
" they are searching for the same protection and respect that pull people into gangs			1
the difference is they are pushed by feelings of marginalization , victimization , and vulnerability that stem from the state 's purported failure to protect @entity32 interests			0
" @entity33 leads to anger			0
@entity36 leads to hate , " @entity35 once said			0
anger also incites people to action , lowers inhibitions , and fashions a desire for revenge			0
there are legitimate concerns about radicalization among existing gang members , because they typically live out the same sociocultural and racial exclusion			1
gang members already hold more anti-authority attitudes than the rest of us			1
add to this the fact many of them go to prison each year , where they come into contact with radicalized individuals and are subject to influence , and the die has been cast			0
for some gang members , joining @entity1 could even make real the mythologized gang life that made gang membership originally so appealing			1
real gang life -- where gang members stand around in the rain waiting for something to happen , or beg , borrow , and steal converted imitation firearms to make good on their threats -- rarely lives up to the hype			1
hence , many real gang members still live at home with their mothers			1
@entity1 , by contrast , lives up to the myth			2
@entity1 is armed to the teeth with samurai swords and kalashnikovs			2
@entity1 governs vast territories and shapes futures			2
@entity1 , flush with oil money , pays far better than minimum wage			1
@entity1 is the street gang on steroids			1
like many gangs , @entity1 grew out of another group ( @entity87 in @entity88 , ) evolved under charismatic authority ( @entity90 , ) made some territorial gains ( @entity92 and @entity88 , ) changed its name a few times ( is , @entity1 , @entity1 , ) and , eventually , provoked a militarized response			1
in no way does this diminish the threat @entity1 poses			2
in gang colors , dissing a rival gang in a self - produced @entity100 video earns you five minutes of fame at best			2
under @entity1 's black flag , beheading an aid worker guarantees life in 24 - hour news in perpetuity			1
having studied how gangs work , i know first - hand some gang members are @entity112			1
others are attracted by the concept of terrorism			0
when gang members identify with @entity112 , however , it is only on a superficial level			1
above all , gang members desire to be feared , thus , as in the @entity121 case in @entity5 , they strategically pose as jihadists and trade on powerful false perceptions about links to @entity87			1
both groups also look for all possible ways to enhance their reputation for violence because violence has a property that other commodities lack : a reputation for violence reduces the need for actual violence			0
to this end , just as internet - based forms of communication play a key role in the cultural transmission of gang symbols and practice , technology also " advances the motives and accelerates the methods of radicalization			0
" contrary to popular belief , however , neither gangs nor terrorist groups formally " recruit " via the internet because " cheap talk " online can not be trusted			0
another thing gangs and terrorists group share , is a deep tension between personnel needs and infiltration risks			1
as a result , many are called to both groups but few are chosen			0
material incentives attract opportunists , so groups screen for commitment			0
illegal activity attracts law enforcement , so they also screen for trustworthiness			0
terrorists recruit in mosques for the same reasons gangs recruit in neighborhoods -- racial and ethnic homogeneity and residential stability inherently promote trust and , in the context of repeated interaction , reputations are acquired and authenticated			2
but radicalization , like gang membership , lives on a spectrum			0
@entity186 , like gang membership , is also a gradual process			0
it begins with personal relationships			0
lost men congregate at mosques , in neighborhoods , and online , finding others like them			0
they build friendships around their faith and its obligations or along the lines of shared identities and social networks			0
eventually , this " bunch of guys " comes to constitute a closed society that provides a sense of meaning that otherwise does not exist in the larger world			0
terror intervention , like gang intervention , needs an emphasis not on the traditional " hot spots " for radicalization , but rather the " hot people " most deeply embedded in extremist networks			0
the old " hot spot " approach to gang suppression alienated communities of color by reinforcing the " us versus them " mentality that forced many people into gangs in the first place			2
our current version of " shock and awe " in response to @entity1 risks prompting retaliation for the same reason : it gives legitimacy to the extremist argument that the @entity234 is complicit in the death of @entity32 around the world			1
as they say in the gang , if you live by the gun , you die by the gun			0
to bring peace , both on the streets and in @entity92 , underlying social and political grievances must be addressed			1
exclusive : from schoolteacher to @entity1 member the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity249 .			2

young @entity1 recruits are searching for same protection and respect as gang members
@entity1 can deliver the myths of gang life , giving access to guns , power and money
gangs and terrorists share a tension between personnel needs and infiltration risks
to tackle gangs and @entity1 , underlying social and political grievances must be addressed
