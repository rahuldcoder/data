-- this is getting ridiculous			2
while the threat of @entity6 is very real in @entity7 , the paranoia it 's generated in the @entity4 is unreal			1
you can count the number of documented cases in @entity4 on two hands -- and still have fingers to spare			2
there are eight confirmed cases			2
and in each one , the patient was either infected in @entity16 or @entity17 , or had contact with @entity19 , the @entity16 returnee who 's the sole fatality of the disease in the @entity4 health care professionals , both within the government and those with little reason to parrot a party line , insist that the chances of any of us catching the virus are minuscule			1
if we really need something to worry about , they say , worry about getting your flu shots			2
from 1976 through 2007 , flu - related causes killed between 3,000 and 49,000 people in the @entity4 and yet , the disproportionate hysteria over @entity6 multiplies contagiously			2
@entity38 , a @entity0 commentator and legal analyst , has given it a name : fear - bola			2
" fear - bola attacks the part of the brain responsible for rational thinking , " she says			0
" it starts with a low - grade concern about the two health care workers diagnosed with @entity6 in @entity50 and slowly builds into fear of a widespread epidemic in the @entity4			1
" complete coverage of the @entity6 outbreak how bad is it ? so bad that nearly two thirds of those queried in a @entity60 / @entity59 poll said they 're concerned about an epidemic in the @entity4 so bad that the @entity62 , in the first week of october , fielded 800 calls from concerned @entity4			0
so bad that even after a @entity50 lab worker -- who isolated herself in her cabin during a @entity66 because she may have possibly handled @entity19 's clinical specimen -- was cleared , the @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 asked students and faculty who were on the same cruise not to come to school			1
here are some more examples of our overreaction : from @entity78 ? not this year @entity79 , a two - year college about 60 miles from @entity50 , sent out rejection letters to some applicants from @entity78 because the country had a few @entity6 cases			1
" with sincere regret , i must report that @entity79 is not able to offer you acceptance for the @entity90 term , " the letter read			0
" unfortunately , @entity79 is not accepting international students from countries with confirmed @entity6 cases			0
" the college called it " the responsible thing to do			1
" " at this time , we believe it is the responsible thing to do to postpone our recruitment in those nations that the @entity62 and the @entity101 have identified as at risk			0
" incidentally , @entity78 had 19 cases , but none in the last 43 days			1
in fact , the @entity105 declared it @entity6 - free on monday			0
who shouts ' @entity6 ' on a plane ? get sick in a parking lot , force a shutdown a woman boarded a shuttle bus in a @entity114 parking lot thursday , got off and vomited			0
a hazmat team responded , the area was cordoned off , military officials going to a @entity119 ceremony were temporarily quarantined , the woman was put into isolation			1
a @entity114 spokesman said it was " out of an abundance of caution			0
" the woman did n't have @entity6			0
get sick on a plane , stay in the bathroom a passenger who vomited in the aisle of an @entity130 plane from @entity50 to @entity131 was allegedly told to stay in the lavatory for the rest of the flight			1
" they told her to stay in the bathroom , and she stayed in the bathroom , " @entity135 , a @entity136 professor who was on the flight , told the @entity137			0
" they said , ' we ca n't let you out			0
' " the airlines told the paper that the woman wanted to stay in the bathroom , and that " there were no concerns related to @entity6			0
" the woman did n't have @entity6			0
go to a conference , go on leave an elementary school teacher in @entity153 was put on 21 days ' leave - the incubation period for @entity6 -- because she went to @entity50 for an education conference			1
while there , she stayed at a hotel about 10 miles from @entity158 , where a patient died of the disease			0
still , parents were concerned , and the school district said it obliged			0
here 's how the @entity163 put it into perspective : about 5 million @entity4 passed through @entity166 in august , the latest month for which statistics are available			1
the woman , of course , did n't have @entity6			0
what 's more contagious than @entity6 ? concern about its spread go to a funeral , go on vacation a middle school principal in @entity177 , @entity178 , who went to his brother 's funeral in @entity7 is now on a weeklong paid vacation			1
why ? because parents pulled their kids out of school friday once they learned of the trip			0
and where in @entity7 did the principal go ? @entity189 , which has reported a total of zero @entity6 cases			1
the principal did n't have ... you know the rest			1
do n't like the team , taunt the player a @entity198 high school soccer player in @entity199 , @entity200 , was taunted with chants of " @entity6 " by players of the opposing team during a game earlier this month			0
the opposing team 's head coach and assistant coach resigned the next day			1
the player ... so on and so forth			0
what 's more disturbing than @entity6 ? the outrageous commentary @entity6 , ' trigger panic last week , a masked man in a @entity215 public bus yelled , " do n't mess with me , i have @entity6 ! " the bus driver was quarantined and the bus taken out of service			1
but officials doubt he has @entity6			0
@entity222 down = paid leave a @entity225 agent at @entity226 is now on paid administrative leave because he / she pat down @entity229			1
she 's one of the nurses who contracted @entity6 after treating @entity19			1
and before her illness was apparent , she took a @entity233 flight to @entity234 , then a flight back to @entity50			1
the agent wore gloves during the pat down , the @entity225 told @entity239 in @entity234			1
and yet , the leave was " out of an abundance of caution			1
" never mind that @entity6 is only spread through direct contact with blood , sweat , feces , vomit , semen and saliva			0
and the uninfected person would have to have a break in the skin that would allow entry of the virus			0
the agent has n't shown signs of @entity6			2
game the system , stoke hysteria a newly booked inmate in the @entity260 in @entity261 hit on a novel way to be spared the gen pop : tell the guards you just got back from @entity7 and you 're experiencing @entity6 - like symptoms			1
he was taken away from other inmates to a hospital , the staff put on protective gear , the area was decontaminated , @entity0 affiliate @entity272 reported sunday			2
turns out , the guy not only did n't have @entity6 , he 's never been out of the @entity4 , let alone to @entity7			1
--- --- the examples go on and on , and each new day brings a couple of fresh ones			0
and with flu season coming up -- with its symptoms of fever , ache and fatigue that are very similar to @entity6 's -- expect the hysteria to ramp up			2
" all we 've known of @entity6 is that it 's some exotic disease in a faraway land that kills people in a very gruesome way			2
that 's all we knew about it -- most @entity4 did -- until a couple of months ago , " says @entity0 's dr. @entity287			2
" so , it 's going to take some time to reset some of that thinking			2
" until then , perhaps we 'll all benefit from this handy quiz : .			0
