or maybe i 'm @entity2 - @entity3 or an @entity2 of @entity3 descent			1
nah , i 'm @entity3 - @entity2			1
it 's how i was raised to think of myself , even though i was born in the most @entity2 of cities , @entity8 , @entity7			1
in 1920 , a group of men meeting in downtown @entity8 founded the @entity11			2
what 's more @entity2 than that ? in that same year , the number of @entity3 immigrants living in @entity7 exploded			1
some 60,000 @entity16 called this most @entity2 of states home , including my @entity19 and @entity20			1
and the @entity21 on my mother 's side			1
i am @entity3 as far back as the " proverbial they " can trace			1
and i was raised to be proud of it			1
i grew up dancing the tarantella and doing the hustle , fearing the malocchio and the monster under my bed , playing the morra and diving for baseballs , and arguing for no good reason at all			2
as @entity37 always told us , " never forget where you came from			2
" she insisted on that , even though only two of her nine children and dozens of grandchildren were born in @entity16			2
that 's how she felt , and that 's how we felt			1
ever since @entity49 gov. @entity48 proclaimed he 's not a " hyphenated @entity2 , " as in " @entity50 , " the debate over " who is us " has grown more heated			1
like many immigrants today , my grandparents came to @entity2 not because they fell in love with @entity2 culture , but because they were desperate to escape poverty			1
my @entity20 , @entity59 , fought for the @entity2 in @entity60 so he could become an @entity2 citizen			1
keep in mind that in the early 1900s , @entity16 were not the beloved paesanos they are today			0
they were ridiculed for their dark skin , for practicing @entity66 , and do n't even get me started on the @entity68 thing			0
even @entity69 could not escape ridicule			0
a 1939 @entity72 article described the yankee great 's heritage like this , " instead of olive oil or smelly bear grease , he keeps his hair slick with water			1
he never reeks of garlic			0
... " in spite of that , @entity20 grew to love @entity2			1
my grandmother did , too , but she also desperately missed " the @entity84			0
" she used to tell my @entity85 that she could n't bear to visit @entity16 because she would want to stay there			0
that did n't make her un-american			0
she loved her @entity3 heritage , but she also loved @entity2			1
so we embraced the rich culture of there and here and developed a strong sense of identity that so many in this country yearn to hold on to			0
" i grew up telling people i was @entity2 , " @entity97 , a @entity98 who works for the city 's @entity100 , told me			1
she added , " but , people were not satisfied with that answer			0
so , when i went to college , i said , wait a minute , they do n't see me as @entity2 , so i 'll call myself @entity108			1
" the current exhibition at the museum explores @entity108 - @entity2 identity			1
@entity97 agreed to talk to me about her personal beliefs			0
she told me , " i feel very strongly about keeping customs			0
especially since i became a mother			0
my husband is @entity119 , we grapple with identity all the time			0
is our daughter a global citizen ? where does she fit in ? " the new @entity126 sitcom , " @entity127 , " premiering wednesday night , will explore similar identity issues			0
like the comedy , " black - ish , " and the coming @entity133 documentary , " the @entity3 , " it will delve into how much cultural diversity should matter when it comes to being @entity2			1
in " @entity127 , " the story centers around a @entity137 @entity108 immigrant family who moves from @entity138 to mostly white @entity139 , @entity140			0
it 's based on chef @entity143 's 2013 memoir of the same name			2
the 11 - year - old star of " @entity127 , " @entity145 , told me his character , @entity147 , wants to " prove he can be part of the group , that he 's the same as anybody else , " despite the fact his parents are @entity154			1
in real life , @entity145 said , he thinks " being @entity154 is cool , " but added , " i do n't really care if i was any other race			0
it would n't matter to me			0
" it 's a sentiment that makes me both happy and a little sad			2
@entity159 , who wrote " a chinaman 's chance , " a book about his own cultural identity , would most likely agree			2
" this idea that we 're a melting pot , to me it 's the wrong metaphor , " @entity159 told me			2
" we 're not just thrown into this pot and cooked together and we all come out together the same beige - brown - blob			2
that 's not what happens			2
what happens is that all of these influences get thrown together , woven together , and hybrids get made			0
little hybrids of @entity3 and @entity178 and @entity108 and @entity179 - @entity2 identities and styles ... get meshed together			1
and we 're hardly conscious of it because we 're in it			0
it 's like water to fish			2
" like water to fish			0
i would guess my youngest cousins will have no idea what @entity159 means			0
and i 'm glad .			0

@entity191 : i am proud to be @entity3 - @entity2
since @entity48 says he 's not a " hyphenated @entity2 , " as in " @entity50 , " debate over " who is us " has grown
