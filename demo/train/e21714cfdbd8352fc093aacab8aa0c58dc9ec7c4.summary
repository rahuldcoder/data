-- the midterm elections are less than three weeks away , but by several measures , @entity2 have already won			1
sure , elections are about the race to the top between competing candidates , but they 're also a barometer on long - term trends , issues and party trajectories			1
while the winners of this season 's sprints have yet to be determined , @entity2 look well - positioned for the lengthier political marathon			1
there 's still a contest for the @entity18 historically , the party in the @entity20 tends to lose seats in @entity22 during midterm elections			1
the second midterm election of a two - term president -- as this election is for president @entity27 -- is usually brutal			0
only six times since the @entity29 has a president come close to gaining seats in both chambers in a sixth - year election			0
add to that this year there are simply more @entity2 - held @entity18 seats up for grabs -- with more ranked " toss ups " than @entity38 - held seats -- and the very fact that @entity2 still have a shot at holding onto the @entity18 is , as vice president @entity41 might say , a bfd			1
@entity2 policies are emerging as third rails witness @entity45 senate minority leader @entity45 , running for re-election in @entity47 , and the dance he did around @entity49 during a debate			1
@entity51 insisted that he would repeal @entity49 " root and branch " but somehow , miraculously , keep the law 's state - based health insurance exchange			0
this shows that despite the lackluster rollout of the @entity49 website , voters still overwhelmingly support the particular details and programs of the law , even in places such as @entity47 , where over 400,000 people have enrolled for health coverage under @entity49 's provisions			2
as the law continues to take hold -- and become more effective and popular -- that rhetorical dance will get more uncomfortable for @entity38 , who are still struggling to reconcile their opposition to equal pay legislation , raising the minimum wage , refinancing student loans and extending benefits for the unemployed			2
when president @entity27 said -- " i am not on the ballot this fall			0
@entity79 's pretty happy about that			0
but make no mistake : these policies are on the ballot " -- he was right			0
and when the @entity87 people weigh in on @entity2 policies , they 'll probably side with @entity2			2
voters know about " @entity90 " in 2012 , it was easy to say the whole " @entity90 " thing was an aberration that can be blamed on a few errant @entity38 candidates such as @entity94			2
but this year , @entity38 doubled down on their attacks on women 's opportunity and reproductive freedom -- and the " @entity90 " brand will now forevermore stick			1
in @entity101 , the @entity38 platform has adopted " fetal personhood " into its state party platform , echoing conservative - backed referenda on the ballots in @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 that would severely restrict women 's control over their own pregnancies			1
republicans also opposed the mandate in @entity49 to make birth control affordable and accessible through all health insurance			0
they have also blocked equal pay legislation and held up re-authorization of the @entity118			0
economic equality and reproductive freedom are basic priorities for women voters , a group that @entity38 already had a tough time winning over			1
the @entity38 even commissioned its own poll that found women voters are " barely receptive " to @entity38 ideas and think the party is " intolerant " and " stuck in the past			1
" by their own deeds , not to mention rhetoric , @entity38 just keep reinforcing their war on women and driving voters away			1
@entity38 appear desperate was n't this election supposed to be about @entity49 ? no , that did n't work			2
so @entity38 tried to make the midterms about @entity138			0
now they 're just generally fear - mongering around @entity141 and @entity142 and hoping that would work			0
but the constantly shifting @entity38 shell game shows how little substantive traction conservatives have with average voters outside their highly gerrymandered @entity20 districts			2
every time they open their mouths , @entity38 candidates show that they habitually bash president @entity27 to distract from the impression that they have neither the intention nor ability to help solve urgent problems facing the country			0
when you 're so worried about the outcome of an election you actively try to discourage @entity87 from voting , even if it means violating the constitution and values you 're sworn to protect			0
mind you , it 's deeply disturbing that @entity38 have used the fig leaf of voter fraud to justify disenfranchising countless legitimate voters to serve their partisan ends			1
but voter id laws are a kind of hail mary pass thrown by a @entity38 all too aware that if it just lets everyone keep voting , @entity38 are going to keep losing elections -- especially as the @entity87 electorate gets younger and more racially diverse			2
that @entity38 do n't mind alienating voters by opposing same - sex marriage and immigration reform , which most young voters support , suggests a profound desperation -- namely , a party aware that it ca n't transform itself for the future and so willing to settle for last gasps of power with its old white voter base			1
meanwhile , democrats are registering new progressive voters in states such as @entity188 and @entity189 at unprecedented rates			0
we still do n't know which party will prevail on @entity193 this november			0
but if these trends are any indication , it will soon become clear which party will increasingly prevail in elections down the road -- the kind of ultimate victory that really counts .			1

@entity203 : midterm elections are also a gauge for trends and party trajectories
@entity203 : by that measure , @entity2 have won on issues and policies that matter to the public
she says @entity38 's war on women have turned off voters ; some @entity38 act desperate
@entity203 : democrats will likely prevail in elections down the road , which is the ultimate victory
