-- ok , so it looks like something from a horror movie			0
but a customized silicone mask , fitted over the face , head and mouth of endurance swimmer @entity8 , was a key difference - maker in helping the 64 - year - old complete the grueling , 100 - mile swim from @entity11 to @entity12 , @entity13 , on her fifth try			1
@entity8 needed the mask for protection against box jellyfish , deadly creatures common to tropical waters and whose venomous sting cut short her fourth attempt to swim from @entity11 last summer			1
because the mask is cumbersome , she only wore it saturday night when her support team feared jellyfish were nearby			1
" i was grateful for it			0
i knew i was n't going to be stung at all			0
i felt 100 percent prepared for the jellyfish , " @entity8 told reporters tuesday morning after her record swim			2
but the design of the mask , with its narrow mouth opening , was not perfect			2
for 13 hours saturday night and early sunday , it caused her to swallow " tremendous volumes " of seawater , which in turn led to bouts of vomiting			0
@entity8 grew dehydrated , weakened and discouraged			2
" that night was hell on @entity42 , it really was , " she said			0
the jellyfish dispersed by sunday afternoon , however , and @entity8 did not wear the mask again during the crossing			1
after @entity11 - @entity13 feat , @entity8 to swim 48 hours in @entity47 venom from box jellyfish contains paralyzing toxins that attack the skin , heart and nervous system and is considered to be among the most deadly in the world			1
twenty to 40 people die from stings from box jellyfish annually in the @entity57 alone , according to the @entity58			1
during last year 's swim , @entity8 wore protective gear over her face , hands and body			1
but the jellyfish still stung her repeatedly in the mouth , aborting her attempt about halfway between @entity11 and @entity12			2
" literally the only square inch exposed of my entire body was the lips			0
we just could n't design a way to protect the mouth and still breathe while swimming , " she said last month in a blog post on her website			0
" yet these animals ... are brilliant at finding animals to sting and they indeed found my lips			0
on both occasions , i suffered the paralysis , the otherworldly sensation of being burned alive			0
" so @entity8 partnered with @entity82 , a @entity83 prosthetics expert who spent a year developing the silicone mask			1
they tried many molds and different designs of the mouth area before finding one that worked best			0
@entity8 tested the mask , along with her other protective gear , by swimming through a swarm of hundreds of box jellyfish in june			1
" as difficult as the swimming was , i was not stung once , " she said			0
" those deadly tentacles could not penetrate			0
" and indeed , the jellyfish were not a problem on @entity8 's triumphant fifth crossing , which she completed monday afternoon after nearly 53 hours in the water			1
opinion : @entity8 shows baby boomers so ' not over ' but the jokesters of @entity104 had some fun with her mask			1
" not only did @entity8 finish her swim , but that new mask of hers can double as a @entity111 costume			2
smart lady , " wrote a @entity114 - based blogger on @entity104			2
and there was this , from a @entity119 - based comedian : " somewhere under the sea the @entity120 of the @entity121 yells at his men " we have failed			0
@entity8 's silicone mask has shamed @entity126 all			1

@entity8 wore a custom - made silicone face mask to protect her against jellyfish stings
box jellyfish , common to waters off @entity13 , contain toxic venom that can stun or kill prey
the mask was developed by @entity82 , a @entity83 prosthetics expert
people joked about the mask 's scary look on @entity104
