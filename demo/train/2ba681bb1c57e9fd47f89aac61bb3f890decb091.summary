-- as the song goes : " @entity1 ' , had me a blast			0
" but for dads with daughters who are falling in love for the first time , it might be anything but a blast			1
unless that kaboom ! is the sound of @entity15 's heart exploding in sadness			2
summer can take a harrowing turn when family vacations and young romance intersect			2
suddenly daddy 's little girl who a year ago wanted to play tennis with you has now completely forgotten you exist			1
no , she 's too busy texting , curling her lashes and scouring the beach for @entity27 the surfer dude			2
" in a certain way dads really do feel jilted , bereft even , " says neuropsychiatrist dr. @entity29			1
" they almost feel like they 've been left at the altar			2
often they think , ' what did i do wrong ? how do i get her back ? ' they 'd had this really special , close relationship between dad and daughter then all of a sudden she takes the off - ramp from that relationship			1
" i remember taking that off - ramp			2
his name was @entity48 and he was older ( 27 to my 18 ) , mysterious and gorgeous			0
and while my hormone - fueled brain was acutely aware my dad was having a hard time coping -- his wide , frightened eyes might have given it away -- the @entity48 vortex had rendered me incapable of caring much ( sorry , @entity15 ! )			1
here 's what dad has to say about the experience : " when my daughter began a serious relationship with someone several years older , beyond my sphere of influence and probably not to my liking , i felt threatened and powerless			1
while i may have wanted to feel that she had become independent and in control of her life , i felt a genuine sense of loss and a nagging fear that i may have not done enough to prepare her for the journey			1
it was one of the more difficult transitions i had to negotiate			0
again -- sorry , @entity15			0
@entity75 says her father had a " total meltdown " when she indicated she wanted to live with her boyfriend			1
so he came up with a solution			0
he built another house on his property for her and her beau to live in			2
" my dad has always overreacted in any fear he would lose my companionship , " @entity75 said			1
ya think ? " he calls me 2 - 3 times a day , " she says			2
" we live ( 300 feet ) apart			2
" while @entity75 's example would make a fantastic episode of a reality tv show about extreme parenting , much like my dad 's angst back then , it 's merely illustrative of the intensity wrapped up in the father - daughter bond			1
a kind of courtship : finding a mom friend in the big city " i think an awful lot of men have a visceral connection with their daughters which is unlike any connection they 've ever had with anybody , " says @entity103 , a father to twin daughters and author of the book " dads and @entity108			1
" " it 's just a very mysterious experience			2
it 's also one we never talk about , which adds immensely to the complication of how ( the daughter 's first love relationship ) plays itself out			1
" " the silence is really intense and then you combine that with ' ok she 's now a teenager and she 's rejecting me and rejecting her mother ' -- that 's part of the process			2
... and you know how powerful the love from this female has been in your life and now you see it other - directed			1
it 's a really hard transition			2
" kudos to my dad for trying to talk to me about his feelings during that life - altering summer			1
he 'd dropped me off at work one day and as i 'd stepped out of the car a gust of wind blew my skirt up , prompting me to force it down with my hands			0
" i 'm @entity146 ! " i said with a laugh			0
@entity15 told me a few days later that he burst into tears as he drove away			0
nice story , @entity15 , i 'd thought , then escaped to my room to lie on the bed , stare at the ceiling fan and listen to very loud @entity154 music while contemplating @entity48 's thighs			2
sure , dads make the usual jokes about this phase , about how they 'll be sitting on the porch cleaning their guns as the new boyfriend arrives to pick up the daughter for a date			1
they might tell their friends with a wink and a nudge they 're imposing a no dating rule until their daughter turns 35			2
then there 's the whole " men know what men are like " thing			2
dads remember how they were at that age : sex - hungry , salivating pimply monsters who see girls as random shapes with boobs attached			1
but there can be so much more to it			0
especially for dads who have been invested in their relationships with their daughters			1
" it 's like he got left for a younger man , " says @entity29			1
" he feels like an older gentleman who 's being discarded			2
we 've done our reproductive duty when ( our kids ) hit that age			0
we had babies , created the next generation -- now get out of the way			0
" i 'm jealous of my baby -- a @entity200 confession while @entity29 , author of " @entity202 " and " @entity203 , " is n't afraid to remind us of the hard truths surrounding our biology , she 's all too aware that these feelings are hugely unpleasant			1
some of her patients who are fathers are so torn up , she says , they pick fights with their wives out of frustration			0
they 'll even look outside their marriages for comfort			0
" men may be more vulnerable to having an affair as a reaction to this time in their life when the daughter is completely pulling away and he 's feeling dissed and heartbroken , and maybe his wife is n't so understanding about it all , " she said			1
and -- cringe alert ! -- a dad 's confusion over daughter 's budding body could also be a factor			1
" nothing scares a dad more than if for any reason he has any sexual feelings towards his daughter , " says @entity29			1
" if she comes out in a really hot outfit as she starts to develop and he finds himself reacting a little bit like a guy , he 's often just mortified			0
it 's a normal reaction			0
" and poor mom ! it 's not like she 's feeling great about daughter 's first romance either			1
there 's a good chance she 's being confronted with the reality of her own aging			0
your daughter is overflowing with seductive fertility while yours may well be waning			0
she 's rocking miniskirts while magazines are telling you that at your age , you should have long given up on anything that lands above the knee			0
was that guy hot for my baby bump ? who knew that a daughter 's first love -- while normal and necessary and precious and unbelievably important to her -- could so brutally shake up the whole family , shining the light ever so brightly on that thing we call the cycle of life ? take heart , dads , there are some @entity271 you can apply when your relationship with your daughter hits the skids that are n't dangerous distractions like affairs and fast mid-life - crisis cars			1
" talk to other fathers , " says @entity103			1
" it 's a really important thing to do			0
" trust your daughter , " says @entity103			1
" it 's much easier to do if you 've been able to trust her all along			1
view trusting your daughter as a way of building her strength , as the most effective way to protect her because then she can learn how to protect herself			0
" just because she 'd now rather go get a bikini wax than wax philosophical with you does n't mean she no longer values your approval			0
celebs and civilians alike expected to ' bounce back ' after baby @entity296 , a father to three teenage girls , says he just tries to focus on being as reassuring as possible			0
" my challenge has been to fight the message that the culture sends : that being beautiful with the perfect figure is what is important , " he says			0
" i have tried to teach that it 's who they are , not what they look like , that is most important			0
all that being said , they are going to have to turn over a whole lot of coal before they find their diamond			0
i have let them all know i will always have their back			0
" @entity29 likes to reassure forlorn dads that their daughters ' transformation is n't designed for the sole purpose of making their fathers miserable			1
" @entity15 should just realize that this is a really normal part of life for the daughter to be going off on her own ... into the young woman stage of life , " she says			1
" and he is going to have to give up part of that special relationship with her			0
and know that she will come back to him in another five or 10 years as a more grown up young woman			0
" @entity48 , the guy from the " @entity146 summer , " is so far out of the picture now that his face is a blur			0
but @entity15 is still around			0
he was here yesterday , in fact , drill in hand , assembling a curtain rod in my daughter 's nursery			1
later he stood at the window , baby in arms , pointing out fat pigeons while she counted them and cooed			0
there 's @entity15 , years later , helping prepare another little lady for the big wide world			0
