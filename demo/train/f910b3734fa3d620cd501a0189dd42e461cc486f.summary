-- extra-time goals from @entity2 and @entity3 spared @entity5 's blushes against @entity6 in the @entity7 last 16 tie at @entity9 on monday			1
following 90 minutes of stalemate it was @entity13 's side who finally broke the deadlock in the second minute of extra time when @entity17 squared the ball for @entity3 to cleverly back heal the ball past goalkeeper @entity20			1
@entity2 drilled in a shot to double the lead in the final minute of the second extra period before @entity24 pulled one back for @entity6 in injury time			1
it was a cruel end to what was a brave performance by @entity29 's side who were looking to settle an old score from the 1982 @entity7			2
@entity6 were eliminated at the group stage at the tournament held in @entity34 after @entity5 and @entity35 contrived a result ( a 1 - 0 win to the @entity38 ) which guaranteed both @entity40 teams would qualify for the knockout stages			2
thirty - two years after the so - called " @entity43 " it was fitting that @entity6 's first last 16 match in the @entity7 was against @entity5			1
spurred on by history , the @entity6 got off to a flying start and perhaps deserved more for their frequent early raids into the heart of the @entity38 defense			0
@entity50 served warning of @entity6 's threat in the eighth minute as he scampered unchallenged down the left after a @entity38 attack broke down			0
the danger was only averted when @entity56 rushed out of his area to tackle the @entity59 striker			0
nine minutes later @entity50 looked to have scored his third goal of the tournament when he headed in @entity63 's superb cross , but was adjudged to be offside -- tv replays showed the referee 's assistant had made the correct call			0
as the half wore on @entity5 came back into the game but were still vulnerable to the counter and were lucky when , in the 39th minute , @entity72 's thunderous 25 - yard drive ricocheted off the boot of defender @entity74 and bounced narrowly wide			0
moments later at the other end , @entity5 were denied themselves as @entity20 pulled off an amazing double save from @entity78 then @entity79			0
@entity3 replaced @entity79 at the start of the second half -- a change which made @entity5 more purposeful in attack			2
in the 54th minute , @entity17 laid the ball on for captain @entity85 whose shot from 18 yards out produced an outstanding fingertip save from @entity20			0
@entity6 's rampant forays forward were less frequent but no less alarming for the @entity5 's back four who continued to struggle with @entity50 's menacing runs			1
as the game entered the final 15 minutes of normal time it was @entity5 who increasingly looked likely to score			0
@entity17 looked certain to head in substitute @entity98 's cross in the 80th minute but could only fire straight at @entity20 and ten minutes later @entity99 missed the chance to head a late winner			0
@entity3 's 92nd minute strike calmed @entity38 nerves before @entity104 got them jangling again eight minutes later with a close range strike which went wide			1
but when @entity2 scored @entity5 's second in the 119th minute they were home and dry despite @entity24 's late goal			1
@entity13 's side can now look forward to a quarterfinal against @entity113 at the @entity114 on friday			1
