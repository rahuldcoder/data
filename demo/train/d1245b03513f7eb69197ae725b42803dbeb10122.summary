-- on the morning of her suicide on july 17 , @entity1 came into work earlier than usual			2
no one knew what went through her head in those quiet hours before other workers arrived , but as @entity10 footage later revealed , she first took 20 minutes to walk around the empty factory before leaping off the fourth floor window			1
the 49 - year old was found dead shortly before 6 a.m. , marking the end of her 12 years at the @entity16 factory			1
@entity1 had just been fired the previous night for participating in a strike that was part of a long - running labor dispute			1
she was one of more than 100 workers sacked for their involvement			2
the tragedy of her death overshadows the surge of labor activism in @entity26			1
of the more than 1,000 recorded strikes and protests that took place from june 2011 to the end of 2013 , 40 % were amongst factory workers , according to employment watchdog @entity32			1
unlikely activism in @entity26 , unions are sometimes ridiculed by internet users as a " laoban gonghui , " meaning they are the " boss ' union			1
" every factory union belongs to the government - controlled @entity40 ( @entity40 ) , a mega-institution with an extensive chain of command			1
" the @entity40 is first and foremost aligned to the @entity43 and secondly to the local government			2
it has never seen itself primarily as a workers ' organization , " says @entity45 , a spokesperson for @entity32			2
at @entity16 though , the factory union was heavily involved from the very first day of the strike , pushing owners to negotiate with the workers			1
most surprisingly , workers directly elected the union vice-chairman , @entity54 , and according to him , the supervising trade union initially approved of their work			0
" in the past , elections of union leaders were controlled by the enterprise ; workers can vote but not nominate			0
often times , workers do n't even know about the elections , " says labor academic @entity61			1
" this case is different			0
" such developments are fraught with uncertainties			0
on june 24 , @entity54 was busy organizing workers when the supervising union suddenly pronounced his election illegal , detaining him for seven days			0
after his release , he has continued to lead workers , demanding their reinstatement			0
" the fact that we have seen individual trade union officials leading workers is a sign that the union is beginning to move in the right direction , " says @entity45			0
he observes that the level of local union involvement in this case is unusual but not unique			0
in early march , trade union chairman of @entity88 's @entity87 store in @entity89 led workers in a fight for fair compensation when the store closed down			1
and in may , women from the @entity97 - owned @entity96 factory in @entity98 successfully formed a democratically elected union after some deliberation			2
policy change for now , these might just be isolated cases , but changes are also happening on a policy level			0
the @entity105 announced in 2012 that it would move enterprise trade unions towards direct elections , beginning with 163 factories			0
on july 2 , @entity109 reported that the @entity110 aims to have all enterprise unions become democratically elected within five years			0
@entity112 academic @entity61 thinks its premature to believe these efforts to democratize the unions will lead to real change , but he still sees it as a step in the right direction			0
" good officials do exist in the government - controlled @entity40 and reform will begin with them , " says @entity61			2
" but most importantly , it is the bottom - up activism that puts pressure on the government to make changes			1
" @entity61 explains that most workers have a deep - rooted mistrust of unions			1
when an issue arises , they often skip over them and organize through their hometown networks or social media instead			0
the government realizes the old way no longer works and is desperate to change the image of the @entity40 , opening enterprise unions for democratic election			1
business interest activists have called for july 17 , the day @entity1 died , to be named " @entity142 , " but her suicide did not dampen the efforts of the factory workers who have filed for arbitration and are awaiting results			1
recent developments are worrying some in the business community			0
a group of @entity154 manufacturing and business associations have opposed a proposal by the @entity157 government to give workers the right to demand meetings with employers to negotiate for better benefits			2
one of the signers of the opposition , the @entity163 turned down an interview request , but in an editorial for the @entity169 , vice-president @entity167 called the proposal " disastrous			0
" he points out that @entity26 's import and export business has weakened in recent years , environmental policy has increased production costs and other labor requirements have already become a heavy burden for employers			1
low - end producers however , data released by the @entity180 ( @entity180 ) on july 27 shows that profits on a whole are rising			0
@entity183 , senior fellow of @entity184 at @entity185 think tank @entity186 , explains that the growth of production is higher in the medium to high - tech sectors , where higher wages have pressured manufacturers to have productivity gain and move up the value chain -- a healthy structural change for the @entity26 economy			1
however , in the low - end manufacturing sector , such as footwear or garment factories , it is very hard to find productivity gains and some of those sectors are starting to move out of @entity26 to @entity203 and @entity204			1
a survey of @entity207 manufacturers by @entity208 suggests that while manufacturers prefer to move their business inland than to move it abroad , 13 % will consider leaving @entity26 to save costs , most of which the study believes are low - end producers			1
towards a domestic consumption economy the government might not see this as a negative change -- @entity26 no longer wants to be in the market only for its cheap labor			1
premier @entity220 has long championed a consumption - led economy			0
" @entity26 has now reached a point where it needs to rely more on consumption			1
it 's the largest exporter in the world , so it 's not realistic for it to grow much faster than the world market , " says @entity183			2
he believes what 's important for @entity26 now is reforms that will encourage consumptions			1
for that to happen , wages have to go up			0
" i view it as a positive thing that in recent years , wages have been rising very rapidly			0
" who needs who ? the one - child policy has slowed down the growth of the labor force , and more young people are going to university rather than factory work			1
more than a decade ago , hundreds would line up outside a factory looking for work , but many manufacturers today struggle to find enough workers			2
with this labor shortage , better working conditions might just be a natural next step , as these days , it is the manufacturers who need workers and not the other way around			2
but with 260 million migrant workers in the country , this progress might take some time -- a progress that @entity1 will not see			2
" it 's obvious to me that madam @entity1 did n't fully understand her rights , " says @entity259 , a legal adviser to former @entity16 workers			1
" if she was aware of her options and knew about the upcoming actions , she would not have jumped			0
" @entity259 further speculates that @entity1 might have been disheartened that the company fired her in a heartbeat despite her 12 years of service			0
he believes that would explain the 20 minutes she spent quietly circling the empty factory floor before she ended her life			0
for the remaining @entity16 workers though , @entity259 is optimistic			0
" even if we do n't win this arbitration , the workers will have contributed to the reform of the system			0

labor unions in @entity26 are ridiculed for their *impotence* and are referred to as " boss ' unions "
bottom - up activism puts pressure on the government to make changes
nearly half of all protests between 2011 - 2013 were related to factory workers ' rights
@entity26 can no longer rely on cheap labor -- so what 's next for " the world 's factory " ?
