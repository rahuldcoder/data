-- after months of hype and speculation , the @entity2 smart watch arrived this week with a bang ... followed by a whimper			1
some commentators were impressed with the device 's technical specifications including its 320 x 320 - pixel , 1.63 - inch amoled touchscreen , an @entity13 processor , a @entity15 battery , and the camera mounted in the wrist strap capable of capturing 1.9 - megapixel stills and 10 - second video clips			1
but many were disappointed by the countless features the smart watch did not include			1
prior to the @entity2 's launch , the internet was awash with fervent speculation as to what the watch would do			1
many hoped that it would come replete with remarkable features such as acting as a projector , or allowing you to check your pulse and body temperature			0
some commentators envisaged a watch made of radical new lightweight or transparent materials that could interface with the world around you to offer a genuine new experience not currently offered by smartphones or tablets			2

" but does it really deliver on its promise ? @entity0 spoke to a number of amateur designers who had mocked up smart watch ideas of their own about their impressions of the @entity2			1
most seemed united in their disappointment			0
" i 'm waiting for a smart watch that does something extra than just bring my phone to my wrist , " says design engineer @entity65 , who mocked up his own smart watch concept in february			1
" i ca n't tell you what it is , because i do n't know			0
i just know that i 'm not paying 300 to 400 bucks for a wrist attaching remote control that needs to be recharged every day			0
" @entity76 , lead designer for @entity77 watches , shared @entity65 's criticisms , saying that in his view the @entity2 will not serve as a replacement for regular watches , because it is lacking in two fundamental aspects : both in its form and its function			0
" at the moment , it is a decent enough electronics product , but it is not a decent enough watch , " @entity76 says			2
" i ca n't see how it will benefit my life			0
do i really want to leave my lovely @entity91 watch at home in order to have a piece of mass produced consumer product with , in my view , limited functionality ? " @entity76 says that @entity47 's decision to tie the @entity2 to a mobile phone means it can not act as a proper cell phone substitute			1
equally , he thinks that its rather industrial looking design , with exposed screws and a metallic finish will win few fans : " they did n't really engage with the idea that the watch is an accessory			2
it needs to be more targeted to a specific lifestyle where it delivers a particular function			0
" not all reviews have been negative			0
@entity117 reporter @entity116 praised the @entity2 's ' attractive ' screen and design ; the @entity121 's @entity120 described it as " quite unlike anything you 've seen before			2
" some have noted that the smart watches have in fact been about for years			0
others say that the smart watch proper still has n't been invented			1
through all the fevered commentary , technological enthusiasts continue to draw up their own visions of what a smart watch should be			1
many now rest their hopes on @entity136 to deliver the device they are waiting for , with countless speculative designs being proffered by the vast community of " @entity141			0
" so how far are we still from a watch that offers haptic feedback , wrist - based payments , gesture controls , and agnostic support for devices regardless of whether they are @entity150 , @entity151 or @entity152 phone ? according to some commentators , we are still galaxies away .			2
