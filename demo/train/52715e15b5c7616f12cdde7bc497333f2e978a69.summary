@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3			0
for @entity6 's middle classes it is breakfast , lunch and dinner			1
in @entity12 @entity11 it is known as " aish " which means both bread and life			1
bread is the staple food of @entity6 's poor -- 40 percent of whom live on around $ 2 per day for many @entity12 the flat , round bread is also becoming a symbol of the country 's inequalities			1
rocketing global commodity prices and failing domestic supplies have made this staple food unaffordable for 20 percent of the country 's 76 million inhabitants			1
the @entity29 's most populous country is not alone in these problems			1
the @entity31 warned economic turmoil could hit many of the world 's poorer countries as global inflation spirals -- but with 40 percent of the population living near the poverty line , the price rise has struck particularly hard			2
earlier this week , in the gritty industrial city of @entity41 , northern @entity6 , a teenager was killed during two days of violent clashes between residents and police			1
the protesters , who are enraged by low wages and rising prices , also tore down a billboard of @entity6 's president @entity49			1
prime minister , @entity50 , rushed to the city to try to head off any further escalation in the civil disturbances and workers were promised bonuses and concessions			0
but for many @entity12 , these moves are too little too late			2
on the streets , the popularity of @entity49 's regime is at an all time low			2
the riots in @entity41 are the latest in a series of flares in social unrest			0
read @entity2 correspondent , @entity68 's blog about the @entity6 crisis despite a growing economy and billions of dollars in international investment , average wages remain low and the gulf between the country 's tiny elite and the majority of workers grows ever wider			1
the doubling of prices over the past year and an acute shortage of government subsidized bread has acted as a catalyst to the population 's smoldering discontent			1
all @entity12 can buy the cheap government subsidised bread under a decades old socialist - inspired system that also provides subsidies for public transport and gasoline			1
as unsubsidized bread -- which can sell at 10 to 12 times the cost of government bread -- becomes unaffordable for a portion of the population the demand for government bread is growing			1
at the same time the supplies of subsidized bread have also decreased			0
the population is jaded and many people believe that corruption is behind the shortages			0
rumors circulate that subsidized bakeries would rather sell their flour on the black market than use it to produce bread			0
people have no choice but to wait in line to buy government bread			2
" i 've been standing here for hours , and we are not close to getting bread yet , " @entity116 , a manager at a medical company told the @entity118 , " of course i need to stand in the line , i ca n't afford the other bread			0
" in recent weeks , two people were stabbed and killed when fights broke out over government bread			2
five others died from exhaustion caused by hours spent standing in line			0
there are fears the unrest could emulate the 1997 bread riots in which 70 people were killed after the government raised the price of bread and other subsidized foods			1
the government is facing a political crisis and has ordered the army -- which normally only makes bread for employees -- to increase production and distribute it to the public			2
the army opened 10 large bakeries in @entity145 and set up 500 kiosks to sell bread to the public , according to the government			0
read @entity150 ' blog about the @entity12 food crisis @entity6 grows about half the wheat it consumes every year and buys the rest from the world market			1
@entity6 's finance minister , @entity155 says this is what is causing all the problems : " the price rise is being driven by what is happening in the international markets			2
the local component is very little			0
" he also believes the international investment and economic growth needs time to trickle down through the whole population , " it 's not enough			0
there are 77 million of us			0
for the 77 million to feel it we need at least five , six , seven years plus of growth , " he said			0
but that wo n't give much relief to the country 's citizens , many of whom currently live on $ 2 a day			0
