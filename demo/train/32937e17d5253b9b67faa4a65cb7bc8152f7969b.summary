-- there was little to celebrate in @entity2 this week as the @entity3 marked the tenth anniversary of its invasion of @entity7			1
the war against the @entity9 is already the longest in @entity3 's history and there are few signs that it will be ending any time soon			2
the @entity7 capital has experienced a number of deadly , high - profile attacks this year			1
a supermarket , the airport , a hospital , a police station , the @entity21 , the supposedly impregnable @entity22 , the @entity23 and the @entity3 embassy have all been targeted			0
when even the @entity25 can not secure its main operations base in the city , @entity7 can be forgiven for concluding that the insurgency , whatever @entity29 might say , is in the ascendency			1
last month 's turban bomb assassination of the former @entity7 president , @entity32 , appeared to deal another serious blow to advocates of peace			1
@entity32 , revered by many as a father of the @entity39 movement that ousted the @entity40 in the 1980s , was also the chairman of president @entity42 's @entity41 , which has been trying for a year to foster dialogue with the @entity9 -- a strategy that @entity42 has now publicly abandoned			1
special : @entity45 the assassin posed as a peace envoy from @entity48 , but the @entity9 leadership in @entity50 announced he was nothing to do with them			2
admiral @entity53 , chairman of the @entity54 , alleged that the @entity50 - affiliated @entity55 were behind many of the @entity2 attacks and that the @entity55 were " a veritable arm " of the @entity59 , the @entity63 military 's notorious @entity61 wing , whom he accused of " exporting " violent extremism to @entity7 through its proxy			1
the @entity68 government naturally rejected this old accusation ; while in a rare interview with the @entity73 , @entity70 himself denied any involvement in the killing of @entity32			1
speculation continues to swirl as to who was responsible for the murder			0
not even the motive is entirely clear			0
but neither @entity32 's death nor any of the other attacks in @entity2 this summer will alter the way this war will come to a close			1
history teaches us that all insurgencies end , eventually , with dialogue , negotiation and political compromise -- a lesson we @entity92 re-learned the hard way during the " @entity94 " in @entity95			0
why should @entity7 be any different ? even the @entity96 acknowledges that there can be no purely military solution to the impasse			1
few @entity101 leaders any longer doubt that the @entity9 will return to political power in some form or other			2
the only remaining question is what form			0
@entity32 , it should be noted , was @entity7 's most prominent @entity107 , not a @entity108 like the vast majority of the @entity9			1
there are those within the @entity9 who may be prepared to share power with the @entity114 minorities in the future -- but plenty of others who are probably not			2
some analysts therefore think @entity32 's assassination was a cynical attempt to eliminate one of the few credible , ethnic opposition leaders ahead of the eventual , inevitable peace deal : a blow for future @entity108 hegemony rather than an assault on the peace process per se			1
the @entity128 was , in a sense , irrelevant			0
its bridge - building efforts since it was set up in september , 2010 have all failed , which is perhaps unsurprising given that the @entity9 have consistently said they will never deal with @entity42 , whom they regard as a weak @entity101 stooge , in charge of an administration they consider irredeemably corrupt			1
this is not to say that the @entity9 leadership is not interested in dialogue			0
it is just that they only want to speak to @entity142 , and they prefer to do this directly , not through the medium of @entity2 , or anyone else			0
" only the @entity3 have the weight to make talks happen , " explained @entity147 , a former @entity9 government minister			2
" it is they who are fighting the @entity9			0
" the insurgency 's leaders are no fools			1
what they most want is the withdrawal of what they see as infidel troops from sacred @entity7 soil and they may calculate that negotiation could be the fastest and least costly means of achieving that end			1
why should n't they ? after all , the @entity3 also wants its troops out @entity7			1
in june , president @entity166 publicly reiterated that all @entity3 combat troops would be home by 2014			2
dialogue has in fact already begun			0
at least two rounds of talks have taken place this year , in @entity174 and @entity175 , between @entity3 officials and @entity177 , one of @entity48 's closest lieutenants : almost certainly the first high level contact between the two sides since 2001			0
the talks , according to most reports , were exploratory rather than substantive -- talks about talks at best -- and even these were nearly torpedoed by the glare of unwanted media attention			0
but they represent an important start , and a useful platform to build upon			0
a common @entity101 mistake in the past has been to view the @entity9 as a monolithic organization , when in reality it is a revolutionary work in progress ; and like all revolutions , it incorporates a wide spectrum of views , from hardliners to relative moderates			0
our task in the @entity202 is to identify , reach out and engage the " moderates , " and to do all we can to ensure that they win their internal debate on the future of @entity7			2
the military approach has manifestly failed , even as it continues			0
negotiating with the @entity9 now represents our best and perhaps only hope of ending this war , and of shaping a better @entity7 future			2
the issue of power - sharing is critical to this , because the @entity213 and other minorities will never now accept a government as heavily dominated by @entity108 as the @entity9 's was in the 1990s			1
if @entity32 's killers were @entity108 nationalists , they are offering a prescription for a resumption of the ethnic civil war that has been going on intermittently for over three decades in @entity7 -- and that is an outcome to be avoided at almost any cost			1
this needs to be the main focus of @entity3 - @entity9 talks as they go forward			0
for now , everything else is a distraction			0
the opinions expressed are solely those of the authors .			0

killing of former @entity7 president , @entity32 , dealt a blow to peace advocates
@entity32 was also the chairman of president @entity42 's @entity41
some analysts say this was an attempt to eliminate one of the few credible , ethnic opposition leaders
*tajiks* and other minorities will never now accept a government dominated by majority @entity108
