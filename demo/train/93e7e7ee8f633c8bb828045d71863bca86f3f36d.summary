-- after news hit that " @entity4 's " @entity3 made a so - called sex tape with @entity7 's " @entity8 " co-star @entity6 , there were conflicting stories about its existence and its origins			1
when originally approached about it on april 8 , @entity13 , 21 , said she knew of no such tape , but implied that something she might not have intended to go public could exist			1
" if i have my own personal stuff , then that 's my own personal things and if there 's anyone that 's trying to be rude or just get at me , then my lawyer will take care of that , " she said			1
then professional porn actor @entity6 said he and @entity13 had shot a full - fledged adult film together			1
he told @entity0 : " essentially , this is what happened , i was approached ( to star in the movie ) and we had this long conversation about how i was the wrong person for the job			2
not to be arrogant because i 'm not famous , but people that are watching porno , i 'm in porn and they would say , ' hey look it 's @entity6 in this porno			1
' ( those in negotiations ) said ' no , it 's fine			1
we want to set this up like you and her are dating ' and i 'm like no , absolutely not			0
they were like , ' no , it 's going to be great : we 'll set you up on a date and call the paparazzi ' and i 'm like no , that sounds like the worst experience of my life			1
absolutely not going to do that			0
i think what happened now , the company has its marketing strategy , she and her people have their marketing strategy			0
i do n't really care , but why ca n't the marketing strategy be , it 's gon na be cool ! wan na see it ? @entity65 's best porno comin ' out soon ! " @entity6 continued : " i picked her up from her hotel room and drove her to set , somebody took a picture of us walking out of the hotel room , i get a call the next morning asking if we 're dating , i say no and they said , well what were you doing and i said we were shooting a porno			1
now there 's this whole thing			2
they 're saying please do n't say any details and i 'm like , i have no desire to say anything to anyone			0
to me , this is n't even a story			0
but , also , i do porn every day			0
" now @entity13 admits that a tape with @entity6 does exist and is negotiating its distribution			1
a spokeswoman for @entity90 had no comment on the matter			0
when asked how , between @entity13 and his " @entity8 " co-star @entity7 , @entity6 has managed to get tangled up with controversial starlets , he said , " i do n't know			1
maybe i 'm the new sex tape			0
" " oh wow , " he noted " that 's gon na be a good headline			2
but i mean , sex tapes are played out and everyone knows they 're fake now			0
like the @entity103 one - everyone 's like , that 's obviously fake			2
she was paid a bunch of money to make a sex tape with her boyfriend			0
and the @entity109 one , everyone 's like , oh wait , that ( other ) girl does porn , she 's just in this movie with her			2
i think everybody has kind of figured out that sex tapes are a hoax , so i think now management is like , you should just hang out with @entity6			1
it 'll be like you 're doing a sex tape -- it 'll be the same drama and controversy and stuff , it 'll be all crazy			0
or maybe i 'm just in ... a place at ... a time ? i do n't even know			0
