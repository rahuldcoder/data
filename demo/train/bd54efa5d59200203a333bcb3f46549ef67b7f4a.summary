@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity5 appears keen to progress swiftly toward a deal reining back its nuclear program in return for relief from international sanctions that have crippled its economy , a senior @entity4 administration official said wednesday			1
she was speaking on the eve of a fresh round of talks scheduled for thursday and friday in @entity0 between the five permanent -- and nuclear - armed -- members of the @entity17 , along with @entity18 and @entity5			1
" for the first time , we believe @entity5 is ready to move this process forward quickly			1
for the first time , we 're not seeing them just use this as a way of buying time , " the senior @entity4 administration official told journalists in a background briefing			1
" i do see a potential for the outline of a first step			0
it can be written on a piece of paper or probably more than one			0
i hope this can be sooner rather than later , " she added , declining to answer questions whether that outline deal may be reached before the weekend			0
opinion : do we want a deal or a war ? @entity5 has consistently said its nuclear program is strictly for peaceful , civilian use and power generation			2
the @entity4 accuses @entity5 of covertly developing a nuclear bomb			1
in its latest quarterly report published in august , the @entity17 's @entity45 suggested @entity5 's nuclear program had " possible military dimensions			1
" the @entity4 and its negotiating partners -- @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity18 -- are looking to work out a two - phase deal with @entity5 , according to the official			1
so far , negotiators from all parties have declined to spell out specifics of any potential deal			0
however , the senior @entity4 administration official spelled out that @entity5 would be required to take action regarding its nuclear program first in exchange for some initial relief from the international sanctions that have targeted @entity5 's key oil sector and banking operations			1
once that was in place , all sides would continue talking about what she termed a " final deal			0
" " we 're looking for a first step that stops @entity5 's nuclear program moving forward for the first time in decades and that rolls parts of it back , " the senior @entity4 administration official said			1
" we 're prepared to offer limited , targeted and reversible sanctions relief			0
we 're not talking about changing the architecture of sanctions in this first step , " she explained			0
sanctions have hit oil output hard in just the past two years , oil experts estimate international sanctions have forced @entity5 to cut its crude oil output from around 2.2 million barrels per day in 2011 to less than 900,000 barrels a day last year			1
sanctions imposed on its banking sector and foreign currency exchange have also made it tough for @entity5 to pump earnings from its oil sales back into its economy at home , sparking a currency devaluation , inflation , unemployment and recession , economic analysts say			1
the senior @entity4 administration official speaking in @entity0 attributed @entity5 's new willingness to compromise on its nuclear aspirations -- seen since this summer 's election of president @entity108 -- to the severity of those sanctions			1
sanctions have been instrumental on @entity5 coming to the table , to change the strategic calculus of @entity5 , " she said			2
such comments , however , seem likely to irritate @entity5 's negotiating team			1
despite coming to the talks table , @entity119 maintains its right to a peaceful , civilian nuclear program , including uranium enrichment			2
in comments published via @entity129 in late september before previous talks , one of @entity5 's lead negotiators , foreign minister @entity127 , wrote : " pres. @entity132 's presumption that @entity5 is negotiating because of his illegal threats and sanctions is disrespectful of a nation , macho and wrong			1
" the @entity135 is due to debate a bill proposing stiffer new sanctions on @entity5 , including measures that could cut its oil output further			2
but the senior @entity4 administration official said the government had asked @entity142 to hold off on a vote for now			1
" we have asked @entity142 to pause ( in its consideration of wider sanctions ) , not indefinitely and not a long pause			0
our diplomatic strategy must be in synch with @entity142 , " she said			0
what the negotiators want from @entity5 the parties involved have steadfastly refused to detail their negotiating stances publicly			0
but political analysts say some of the key demands from the @entity157 revolve around @entity5 temporary halting all uranium enrichment activities and shipping stockpiles of more highly enriched uranium abroad for safekeeping			0
the @entity4 and its international partners also want to impose a comprehensive inspections regime on all @entity5 's nuclear - related facilities			1
especially concerning are an underground enrichment plant at @entity165 , near the holy city of @entity167 , that they believe could be a military facility , and a heavy water reactor at @entity171 , which weapons experts warn could be used to process weapons - grade plutonium			0
for its part , @entity5 wants an end to the economic and political sanctions imposed by the @entity178 , the @entity4 and the @entity179			2
in comments reported by @entity5 's state - run @entity184 this week , deputy foreign minister @entity180 , also scheduled to play a lead role in this week 's talks , sounded caution on prospects for a deal			1
" we have a tough road ahead			0
in @entity0 , we will get into the details of the steps , and we hope to bring closer the views of both sides , which are [ currently ] far apart , " @entity180 said			0
@entity5 's supreme leader ' not optimistic ' about nuclear talks the senior @entity4 administration official acknowledged differences between the sides but sounded more optimistic			1
" there are gaps between the two sides , which remain quite real			0
we 're coming to understand each other and to understand what the equation looks like , " she said			0
enough processed uranium for a nuclear bomb ? in parallel with its talks with the @entity157 group , @entity5 officials have been meeting separately with @entity45 representatives to try and allay their fears about @entity5 's nuclear program			1
according to the @entity45 's august report , since declaring its nuclear facilities , @entity5 has enriched just less than 10 metric tonnes of uranium to 5 % purity , the grade used for energy generation			2
the @entity45 estimates @entity5 has enriched around 370 kilograms to 20 % purity , further processing part of that for medical and research purposes and stockpiling about 185 kilograms			0
some weapons experts suggest @entity5 could enrich enough uranium -- at 90 % purity -- for a single nuclear bomb within months			1
others argue it could take more than a year			0
all appear to agree that so far , @entity5 has not shown signs of developing a weapons system to deliver such a warhead			2
@entity5 says it has no desire to build a bomb			2
five of the nations negotiating in @entity0 have nuclear weapons			2
according to the @entity241 - based @entity240 , the @entity4 has around 5,000 nuclear warheads , @entity52 has around 4,500 , the @entity50 an estimated 225 , @entity53 around 240 and @entity51 around 300 warheads			2
@entity244 , which is neither a signatory to the @entity246 nor has declared its own nuclear program , is estimated to have as many as 200 warheads , according to the @entity240			0
