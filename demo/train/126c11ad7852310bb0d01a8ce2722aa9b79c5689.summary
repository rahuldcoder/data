-- the july 2011 deadline to begin withdrawing @entity5 troops from @entity2 is unrealistic and unhelpful , @entity2 ambassador @entity1 told @entity0 's " @entity6 " sunday			1
" first , if you over-emphasize a deadline that is not realistic , you are making the enemy a lot more bold , " @entity1 said			0
" you are prolonging the war			0
that deadline should be realistic			0
the line should be based on the reality on the ground and we should give a clear message to the enemy , to the terrorists who are a threat to everyone , that the @entity5 , @entity22 , @entity2 are there to finish this job			1
" he continued , " if that 's not the feeling , we lost the support of the @entity2 people , and also make the neighboring countries of interest a lot more bolder to interfere in @entity2			2
" president @entity33 and gen. @entity34 , who has replaced gen. @entity35 as the top @entity5 commander in @entity2 , have said they would begin withdrawal in july 2011 depending on conditions on the ground			1
appearing on @entity44 's " @entity43 , " sen. @entity41 , @entity42 , questioned the wisdom of a firm deadline to start withdrawing forces			0
" i 'm all for dates for withdrawal , but that 's after the strategy succeeds , not before , " said @entity41 , the @entity48 presidential candidate in 2008 who was in @entity2 for the @entity49 weekend			2
for now , @entity41 described the strategy as one that has n't gone as well as hoped			0
" the president should state unequivocally that we will leave when we have succeeded , " he said			0
" if you tell the enemy that you 're leaving on a date certain , unequivocally , then that enemy will wait until you leave			0
" @entity41 's @entity48 colleague , sen. @entity62 of @entity63 , echoed those thoughts in a separate interview from @entity2 broadcast on the @entity68 program " @entity69			1
" " if you send a signal to your enemy you 're going to leave at a certain date , they 'll wait you out , " @entity62 said			0
however , he expressed optimism that the counterinsurgency strategy now being led by @entity34 can show progress in turning over security to @entity2 forces in some areas by july 2011			1
" i do believe next summer we can have transition in certain parts of @entity2 , " @entity62 said			2
" other parts will still need fighting and a firm commitment			0
" overall , @entity62 said , he found morale on the ground " pretty good " as @entity34 assumed command of the mission			2
his trip coincides with the visit to @entity2 by vice president @entity92 , and @entity62 said @entity92 had assured him that any withdrawal of @entity5 forces from the country would be " conditions - based " instead of launched purely for the sake of getting out without consideration for the status of the mission			1
@entity62 joined @entity41 in urging @entity33 to clarify the conditions - based approach so that the nation 's allies and enemies understand the @entity5 commitment to the war			1
last week , some democrats in @entity109 supported an amendment to a military spending bill that would have required @entity33 to give @entity109 a new intelligence report on @entity2 by january and a plan for withdrawing troops by april			1
if @entity33 fails to carry out his pledge to start bringing troops home by july 2011 , @entity109 would need to approve additional funding for the war , the amendment said			1
the measure failed in a late - night vote after the @entity120 threatened to veto the bill if it contained the amendment , but the language showed some restlessness among @entity108 about the war strategy .			0

new : sen. @entity62 : withdrawl should only begin when conditions warrant it
@entity2 and @entity5 *critics* say troops should stay until success is assured
@entity33 has said withdrawal would start in july 2011
withdrawal also depends on situation on ground , @entity33 says
