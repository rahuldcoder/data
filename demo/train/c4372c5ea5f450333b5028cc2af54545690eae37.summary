-- as recent high - profile attacks at major companies like @entity8 and @entity9 , major publications like the @entity2 and @entity3 and the @entity5 government itself have made clear , cyber-crime is a very real and growing concern for everyone			1
the latest threat report from security firm @entity14 highlights the need for vigilance on mobile devices and a change in how people and companies approach security			1
smartphones and tablets are increasingly hot targets for cyber-criminals , and the volume of mobile threats is growing much faster than it did for @entity28 the amount of malware detected by @entity14 on the devices in 2012 was 44 times what it was the previous year			1
the company estimates that 95 % of all mobile malware ever devised has been created in the past year alone , and the vast majority of that is made for the @entity38 operating system			1
but @entity14 's worldwide chief technology officer , @entity39 , warns against looking at the the number of threats targeting @entity38 and assuming that other platforms are safer			1
criminals are targeting the operating system partially because it is so open , and also because they tend to focus on the platform they think will be around the longest			1
what makes these portable devices such juicy targets for criminals is that they are rife with personal and financial information			1
for example , many phones have banking features baked in , and criminals can use " trojan horse " viruses to milk them dry using sms services that charge per text			2
malware is n't even the biggest issue for mobile users at the moment , says @entity39			1
phone owners should be more concerned about visiting a site that will do something malicious on their behalf			0
" a huge amount of mischief on the @entity70 happens without anything being downloaded , " said @entity39			2
it 's much easier to execute these kinds of scams on smartphones than on desktop computers			2
with small screens and pared - down mobile sites , cyber-criminals can create a legitimate - looking banking site and trick the person into entering personal information needed to access an account , such as an account number , password and mother 's maiden name			1
many intrusions begin in this type of simple way , often with a bad link in an e-mail or on a social network or a webpage that directs a person to a compromised or malicious site			0
" there 's a reason why those old - school attacks keep getting used , " said @entity39			1
" the @entity14 report found that the volume of suspicious urls jumped significantly in late 2012 , averaging 4.6 million a month			1
in addition to mimicking sites to phish for information , the links can download malware onto a mobile device			1
that software can send private data like passwords back to the attackers , or it can add the computer to a botnet -- a network of infected computers controlled by cyber-criminals			0
the software is downloaded so quickly that most people wo n't even notice			0
it 's no longer the case that a computer will feel sluggish if there 's malware installed , points out @entity39			1
decent malware wo n't even be noticeable			0
@entity9 and @entity8 traced their recent breaches to similar incidents			0
employees visited hacked sites for developers that installed malware on their machines			0
these hacks , along with @entity135 's january breach that resulted in 250,000 user accounts possibly being compromised , were the work of @entity140 gangs searching for intellectual property or other information to resell , according to @entity143			0
a recent report from security company @entity145 described what it believed to be a powerful computer - hacking operation in @entity148 run by the @entity150 military			2
this alleged high - tech espionage targets @entity5 companies in an attempt to steal trade secrets			1
the issue is so serious that the @entity5 government released an extensive report on wednesday that includes instructions for corporations on how to improve their security			1
regular people will not be immune to the problems plaguing corporations and governments , according to @entity39			0
once these weapons , such as malware , are out in the world , they spread			0
attackers can steal the code written by one government and use it to go after other targets			0
while the origins of recent attacks have been grabbing headlines , @entity39 warns against turning all of our attention to the " bad guys " instead of the systemic security issues on the companies ' side			1
" it 's not about who 's attaching you , it 's about the fact that you 're vulnerable , " said @entity39			0
he said putting a face on the cyber-criminals " makes it sound like you can go negotiate with an entity to stop them			0
that 's never been the case with cyberattacks			0
" the current approach of discovering threats , then fighting them , has to change , according to @entity39 ; he called it " a thousand percent unsustainable			0
" new threats are popping up constantly , creating a never - ending game of security whack - a - mole			2
there are new highly sophisticated attacks that insert themselves below the operating system and can steal all a device 's data before wiping it clean			2
ransomware is on the rise , in which a criminal steals data or takes control of a computer or mobile device , only releasing their hold when they receive payment			0
a new attack called @entity218 uses phishing schemes to install a @entity220 , which monitors web traffic and scrapes banking information in order to transfer money out of the victims ' accounts			0
in order to address all these threats , @entity39 said , the industry needs to rethink security from the ground up , designing more secure products from the start instead of just constantly chasing threats			2
" we have to take some of the most complex security issues and simplify them into easy - to - solve problems , " he said .			2

latest @entity14 threats report sees huge spike in mobile malware
there 's also been an *uptick* in suspicious urls and criminals targeting financial info
attacks on major companies , @entity5 government have thrust security into spotlight
these issues will affect everyone in the coming years , not just large companies
