-- @entity1 took his first yoga class in the 1990s , right as the practice began gaining in popularity in the @entity5			1
" they did n't even have any yoga mats , " he said , recalling the @entity7 sports club that offered the class			1
it was n't until @entity1 started taking classes at yoga studios that he realized a lot of the previous sessions were " watered down " versions of yoga			1
the loose interpretation was n't bothersome ; yoga by definition is a diverse practice with more than a dozen different styles			1
but as @entity1 remembers , some of the poses the inexperienced teachers were demonstrating were simply not right			2
" the instructors were cool people , and they 'd play good music , but students did n't know they were being taught poorly , " said @entity1 , who became a yoga instructor himself 14 years ago			1
and , according to author and @entity33 science writer @entity32 , some of the common yoga poses can cause serious injuries like nerve damage , torn cartilage , and strokes , among others			1
an article adapted from @entity32 's upcoming book on yoga featured in the @entity42 earlier this month with the title " @entity44 , " sparked a lively debate within the yoga community about how to keep practitioners safe			1
in the article , @entity32 noted that yoga is a " free - for - all " with " no hierarchy of officials or organization to ensure purity and adhere to agreed - upon sets of facts and poses , rules and procedures , outcomes and benefits			1
" @entity32 is correct -- there is n't a government oversight committee dedicated to yoga practice			1
and that 's because many practitioners prefer it that way			1
" yoga comes from @entity67			2
things are not uniform by tradition , " said @entity68 , who has taught yoga for 25 years			2
in an effort to provide a common ground for the diverse practice of yoga , a group of seasoned yoga practitioners -- " yogis " -- came together in 1999 to form the @entity79 , a nonprofit organization whose sole purpose is to create minimum standards for yoga teacher training			1
fearing government or insurance companies might step in and start calling the shots , the alliance set forth to self - regulate , said @entity68 , who is the co-founder and vice chairman of the organization			0
it is for yogis , by yogis			0
after all , @entity68 said , those " who do n't understand the landscape of yoga are n't qualified " to regulate the standards for teaching			2
anyone trained by schools registered with the @entity79 completes 200 or 500 hours of training , based on the following five principles : yoga techniques , including poses , breathing and meditation ; general teaching methodology ; anatomy and physiology ; yoga philosophy and ethics ; and training , practicum , and supervised teaching , in which senior instructors observe trainees to identify and correct any issues			1
@entity68 said the five principles allow for " a lot of wiggle room , " and aim to protect and promote the teacher 's individuality			2
once trained , the instructors are certified by their school and their names are listed on a registry that informs the public of teachers in their area who have completed the minimum standards for yoga instruction			1
@entity79 - trained teachers may also use the trademarked " @entity134 " -- registered yoga teacher -- behind their name , indicating they 've completed the required hours			1
not all members of the yoga community are on board with this approach , however			1
@entity140 , co-founder of the @entity141 , a nonprofit that provides continuing education to yoga practitioners , disagrees with yoga regulation of any kind			1
he believes in a free market approach to regulations for yoga teacher training			2
" yoga is about freedom , " he said , " the market place is the ultimate quality control			2
" yoga instruction , he said , is about a relationship between a teacher and a student			2
if a teacher is trained to teach yoga on the @entity160 or by a dvd at home and the student is fine with it , it 's really nobody 's business			1
@entity68 said he has no problem with that approach			0
" it 's not illegal to teach without training as a teacher , " he said			2
but @entity1 is more wary			0
he believes that learning how to align properly is something that needs an " expert eye , " one that ca n't be achieved by watching a dvd			0
" anyone can tell you what to do , it 's explaining how to do it , " he said			0
and that is what separates effective teachers from the rest , according to @entity1			0
" it 's alignment with awareness , " he said			0
@entity1 trains teachers at a studio where he teaches in suburban @entity185			0
his 200 - hour training class meets one weekend a month for 10 months , a long stretch of time imperative to the teaching process			0
" you need time for information to settle , " @entity1 said			0
since yoga instruction is far more complex than just leading students to do poses , @entity1 said he reserves the right to extend the training past 10 months if needed			0
he wants to give his new teachers whatever time they need to assimilate the information so that they can feel confident teaching others			0
" it 's the integrity and the awareness that the teacher brings to class that is most important , " @entity1 said			0
@entity1 said successful teachers are committed to the safety for their students and will provide suggestions for modification , as well as props like belts , blankets and blocks to make those modifications			0
a willingness to adapt the practice for different audiences and environments helps too			0
" i 've taught yoga in the oddest of places , " he said			0
good teachers " can teach yoga in an auditorium , a prison , a hospital			1
" they " can transform the whole thing just by who they are			0

a recent @entity42 article created shock waves in the yoga community
titled " how yoga can wreck your body , " the author *claimed* yoga can cause serious injuries
there 's no formal oversight of yoga , and most instructors prefer it that way
many yoga practitioners disagree on whether teachers should be formally trained
