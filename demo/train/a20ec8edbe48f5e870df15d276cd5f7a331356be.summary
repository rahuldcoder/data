-- real men eat salads			1
i know this because i am a dude			1
right now , in my fridge , i have five bottles of hot sauce , a jar of @entity9 and half a pack of hot dogs			2
but recently i went to lunch with a couple of buds , and i ordered a salad			1
it was a basic frissée salad with bacon , shallots and a poached egg , tossed in a light vinaigrette			1
@entity22 is a curly , toothsome leaf , bitter enough to balance bacon and egg but still possessed of a pleasant spring			2
my friends laughed at me			2
one ordered a burger , the other fried calamari			2
i was chastised for not eating " man food			1
" for those of you who are n't familiar with this gender normative term , " man food " is food that you 'd imagine a lumberjack or a cowboy or a @entity35 would eat			1
towers of butter - soaked pancakes			1
pots of napalm - hot chili			1
thoroughly unsubtle , " man food " is rustic fare meant to satisfy a hearty appetite			1
quantity is prized over quality			2
calories are " fun points			2
" the more " fun points , " the tastier the belly filler			2
but sometimes a dude needs a change			1
a fresh , crisp , crunchy salad			1
salads offer breathers between manly meals			2
spinach , cucumber , tomato , red onions , mushrooms , chickpeas , oil and vinegar -- that is my usual jam			0
i do n't need any fancy , goopy dressings compromising my vegetables			0
( what does a ranch actually taste like , anyway ? ) sometimes , i might throw some almonds or walnuts up in there			0
i 've been known to be down with blueberries and mandarin oranges			0
i like bacon or grilled chicken on occasion			0
i am not a fan of unnecessary carbs like croutons			0
and then there are those moments i go crazy and get a frissée freakin ' salad			1
i did n't evolve without help			0
there was a time where , if i cut myself shaving , i 'd bleed sausage gravy			1
my heart squeezed more than it pumped			0
and i also grew what i call " fat wings			0
" luckily , the woman i was dating at that time did n't like any of those things			0
being able to sit in a bathtub full of buffalo wings is every dude 's birthright , but i eventually learned that being attractive for your significant other is also pretty manly			1
my girlfriend was a smart woman and did n't bring up my devolving into a human biscuit			0
what she did was announce that we were going to save money so that saturday nights , we could go to the local barbecue joint and destroy some cow with our faces			1
obviously , my first thought was , " aww , she wants me to help her lose weight			1
" so i humored her			0
she came home from the supermarket with a stack of plastic disposable containers			0
in each , she put one potential salad ingredient			1
not only the ones that would become my favorite but kidney beans , green peppers , corn and pepperoni slices			0
she created a mini-salad bar in our fridge			0
it was easy , and i was told i could eat as much as i wanted			2
this became my lunch and occasional dinner			0
you know what ? we saved money			1
and my girlfriend and i , well , let 's just say we had the whoopee time			0
i kept this up this salad - centric diet for months			1
my friends would come over to watch a fight or brawl on the @entity148 , and i 'd meet them at the door with a salad in my hand			1
the landlord would need my help with some drywall ; i 'd put my salad down			1
at work , i 'd articulate corporate strategy during lunch meetings spearing cucumbers in my lucky bowl of awesome salad			1
i made eating salad sexy			2
i made it macho , macho			0
is it rabbit food ? friend , if it 's rabbit food , then that rabbit is the size of a ferocious bear			2
my friends poked fun at me as i munched on my fancy salad			2
i love how the warm yolk from the poached egg lightly coated the frissée , adding a dimension of hardiness to a dish with such leafy bounce			0
and the bacon chunks added just the right amount of fatty salt , more sturdy ballast			0
we were out celebrating one guy 's birthday			0
the other guy , an old friend from college , was " in - between gigs			2
" it had been another tough year			0
" salad is not man food , " they mocked			1
oh , but it is			0
i ordered a final round of beers			0
then i picked up the check			0
are salads manly ? what is the manliest salad ? are you the sort of guy who would n't touch a salad if a gun was put to his head ? tell us in the comments whether you think salads can count as " man food			1

sometimes a dude needs a fresh , crisp , crunchy salad instead of " man food "
" man food " is what you 'd imagine a lumberjack or a cowboy or a @entity35 would eat
on a salad - centric diet , this *writer* lost weight , saved money and gained energy
