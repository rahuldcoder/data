-- gone are the days of the grainy camera phone images with the resolution of a poor imitation @entity4			2
today 's smartphone cameras are so advanced that mobile photography is becoming an art form in its own right , turning photo - sharing apps like @entity11 into portable galleries for amateur photographers , and professionals like street style photographer @entity15 and chief official @entity17 photographer @entity16			1
" you have the dark room in your pocket , " says @entity21 , the @entity22 - based founder of @entity23 , the world 's first publishing house dedicated to mobile photography			1
this month , out of the phone follows its debut publication , last year 's book of mobile photos from two - time @entity32 - nominated photographer @entity31 , with out of the phone : the @entity34 2014 , a diverse selection of 100 @entity11 images taken by users from 25 countries			1
democratizing photography before founding out of the phone in 2013 , @entity40 ran a fine art photography printing company that counted @entity43 and @entity44 as clients			1
he first started following mobile photography on @entity11 in 2011 , and was surprised and impressed by the quality of work that hobbyists were creating			1
" now there are many well known photographers who use the platform , but at the very beginning , there were many people who did n't know so much about photography , and these were the kind of people that i wanted to showcase , " he says			1
" but on the other hand , it was also something confusing because there are too many images			0
" the desire to curate what he was seeing , coupled with a longtime ambition to create books , led him to give publishing a try			0
while @entity40 had preselected a number of established photographers to feature in this year 's inaugural anthology ( he 's hoping it will become an annual publication ) , he also gave @entity11 users the chance to put themselves up for consideration , using the hashtag # outofthephone to nominate their best works			1
he was astounded to receive over 20,000 submissions			0
what was he looking for in a successful entry ? technical skill was understandably important , but @entity21 says he also sought something less tangible			0
" at the end , what is important is the story and the sensibility of the photographer ... it 's a mix between a good story , a good composition , " he says			0
" photography , for me , is a sort of fresh air , a way to look at things differently			2
so i 'm looking for that sort of feeling when i look at pictures			2
" preserving " moments of grace " now that @entity106 has been published , @entity40 is looking forward to promoting his concept and expanding			0
he 's looking to start hiring in the @entity110 ( so far , it 's been a one - man operation ) , and solicit investors and partners			0
several projects are set for release next year , including books from award - winning documentary photographer @entity118 , and other photographers he believes are using the medium to its fullest			2
" some images deserve to get to paper because it 's a kind of memory , " he says			0
" if i can help to keep memory of interesting moments , some moments of grace perhaps ... i think it 's interesting to fix them on paper and to alert to people not to forget them			0
" out of the phone : the @entity134 is available for purchase online			2
