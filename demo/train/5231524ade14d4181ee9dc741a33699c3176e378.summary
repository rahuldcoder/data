-- three of the largest @entity3 advocacy groups in the @entity4 are opposing airport passenger screening measures they say require hand - searches of turbans , despite the use of electronic imaging technology			1
the @entity10 , @entity11 and the @entity12 are lobbying members of @entity14 in an effort to pressure federal transportation authorities to re-examine a policy they say unfairly scrutinizes members of the @entity3 community			2
" @entity3 @entity4 are already looked at differently in this country , " said the @entity10 's director of programs , @entity21			0
" once you start pulling @entity3 aside for extra screening , it sends a message that the government is suspicious of them for the same reasons [ other passengers ] are suspicious of them			0
" the @entity4 @entity31 adjusted security procedures in 2007 to include provisions for " bulky " clothing that includes headwear , according to an agency statement			0
removal of all headwear is recommended , it said , but the rules are meant to accommodate passengers who may not want to remove the items for religious , medical , or other reasons			0
transportation officials would not confirm whether " advanced imaging technology " can sufficiently see through turbans , citing security reasons			1
despite the advent of the advanced technology , transportation security officers are permitted to use " professional discretion " in determining if a particular item of clothing should be subject to further screening , according to the statement			1
authorities say the policy has remained unchanged since 2007 , but @entity3 advocacy groups argue that airport security procedures were recently ramped up to include extra screening for all turban - wearing passengers			2
@entity21 said @entity4 @entity3 groups that had once observed " a patchwork of [ airport security ] policies " are now witnessing a process in which " all turbans are searched			1
" @entity0 was not able to independently verify that claim .			0

@entity3 groups oppose airport screening rules they say now require searches of turbans
transportation officials say the policy has not changed
security officials can use " professional discretion " to *supplement* imaging technology
