-- if you often order a bloody mary or tomato juice on a plane , yet rarely order them elsewhere , science may have just explained your bizarre in - flight urge			0
a bloody @entity8 could be one of the few drinks that actually tastes as it 's supposed to in the air , according to the authors of a paper in the online journal @entity15 , entitled " airplane noise and the taste of umami			2
" previous studies have shown that loud noises , such as an aircraft engine , can reduce our ability to taste flavors by up to 30 %			1
" @entity29 , however , is immune to this effect , " authors @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 write			1
" there is even some evidence to suggest that it ... may actually boost some of the other basic tastes			0
" @entity29 has been called " the fifth taste , " after salty , bitter , sweet and sour , and has been likened to a " savory " flavor			1
@entity29 effect @entity37 suggest this might explain the popularity of tomato - based drinks on flights			2
" a key feature of tomatoes is that they are rich in umami ... perhaps all those travelers who order a bloody @entity8 after the seatbelt sign has been turned off have figured out intuitively what scientists are only now slowly coming to recognize empirically			2
" they also say this could help chefs and diners plan their meals			0
" one might also want to recommend an umami - rich menu -- that is , foods such as parmesan cheese , tomatoes , and mushrooms -- to all those vocal restaurant critics out there , especially it seems in @entity61 , who have been complaining that the background noise in many restaurants is simply too loud nowadays			1
" but do n't forsake water for bloody @entity8 marathons just yet			0
the authors say more work is required to confirm their hypothesis .			0

aircraft engine noises have been shown to impair taste *reception* by up to 30 %
however umami , the so - called " fifth taste , " may be immune to this effect
@entity29 - rich foods such as tomatoes , parmesan cheese , mushrooms , good *options* for fliers
