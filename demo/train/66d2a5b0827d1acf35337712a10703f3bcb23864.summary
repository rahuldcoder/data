@entity1 , @entity0 -- when it comes to bagging the best jobs behind the camera , @entity4 a-lister @entity3 says that women have to make their own luck			1
@entity3 in " @entity10 , " which she both stars in and executive produces			0
indeed , the 33 year - old 's career could be seen as a template for what women can achieve in the industry			2
as an actress , @entity18 is famous for roles in films as diverse as serial killer biopic " monster " and @entity25 superhero movie " @entity26 , " switching with apparent ease between small independent movies and big - budget blockbusters			1
@entity18 also represents a small minority of women who work behind the camera in @entity4			1
during the 15 years she has worked in the @entity35 film industry she has also produced four films			1
the latest is @entity37 's " @entity10 , " which she both stars in and executive produces			0
at a time when women are picking up increasingly varied roles in front of the camera , statistics show they are failing to make the same headway behind the scenes			1
last year , women made up just 16 percent of all directors , producers , writers and cinematographers who worked on the 250 top grossing films in the @entity35 but , says @entity18 , there is no point in complaining about the tough time women have getting work behind the scenes in the movies			1
do you think breaking through through the glass ceiling is still an issue for women in @entity4 ? ? " i try not to kind of bitch and complain about what [ women ] do n't have , " @entity18 told @entity2			1
" it 's a tricky thing because , i think , if you want to find that lynchpin , you can , in anything			0
" i look at the work that i 've done and i feel incredibly proud that i 've had the chance and the opportunity to work on the material that i have			0
" originally born in @entity76 , @entity18 is best - known for her harrowing depiction of prostitute turned serial killer @entity80 in " @entity22			2
" " @entity22 " was also the first film @entity18 produced , taking a huge risk on a low - budget project with a script penned by a first - time director -- and with no previous experience of producing herself			1
@entity18 saw the film as an opportunity to move away from the lighter roles that are often thrown in the direction of a starlet with looks to spare			2
" it 's what i 've been dying to do with my career , " she told @entity96 paper @entity95 at the time			0
" the work i 've been doing the last couple of years is not really what i wanted			2
if you 're not careful , you get typecast			0
" she was awarded a best actress @entity104 for her role in 2004 and " monster , " which was made for just $ 8 million went on to gross over $ 60 million worldwide			1
it is unsurprising , then , that @entity18 's attitude towards women in @entity4 is one of stand - up - and - be - counted			1
although , she says that she will only produce films she feels she can bring something to			0
" the things that i 've produced have been because i really feel like i can lend some kind of knowledge to making a certain film			0
" when i meet a certain director and there 's a certain amount of chemistry and we see the same film , and we just kind of feel like we want to set out and make a film together , it just kind of happens			0
" like " monster " -- and @entity18 's other producing credits , @entity131 rap documentary " @entity132 , " and indie drama " @entity134 " -- her latest film " @entity10 " is also by a first - time director			1
the difference this time is that @entity140 is already a well - established , @entity104 - nominated @entity4 screenwriter			1
the @entity143 filmmaker first came to prominence through his close relationship with fellow @entity143 @entity146			0
@entity37 wrote the screenplays for " @entity148 , " @entity104 - nominated " @entity149 " and " @entity150 , " all of which were directed by @entity146			2
@entity37 , famed for his nonlinear narrative style , also wrote the screenplay for " @entity10 , " a project of such personal resonance for the writer that it was a natural progression for him to also direct the film			0
despite @entity18 's success in bringing @entity37 's vision to the big screen , @entity18 says she is not ready to move into producing bigger films yet			1
" there 's no way that i , right now , could produce a massive blockbuster , " @entity18 told @entity2			2
" i just do n't feel prepared for that			0
" i would n't produce something where i did n't feel like i had the skill			0
" however , @entity18 feels positive about not only her own position in @entity4 , but also that of her female peers in the industry , such as fellow @entity104 winner @entity174			1
" i thought @entity174 did an amazing job			0
i do think that it 's in our hands to make sure we keep working with the right people who want to go and explore those themes and want to push the envelope and want to tell great female stories			2

@entity18 says women must make their own success behind the camera
in her 15 years working in @entity4 , she has produced four films
she produced " monster , " for which she was awarded a best actress @entity104
