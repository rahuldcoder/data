how do you solve a problem like email ? @entity5 's @entity4 team thinks it knows how : with a new app called @entity7			1
@entity7 , which launched wednesday , offers a different way of handling the daily avalanche of email			1
specifically created with mobile users in mind , it sorts and turns emails into reminders , highlights the important bits and adds outside information it thinks is helpful			1
even as people are turning to other tools to quickly communicate from their phones -- messaging apps , social networks , text -- email remains an invaluable if sometimes infuriating way of communicating from mobile devices			0
you can filter out spam , something @entity4 excels at , but there 's still a huge volume of legitimate email to deal with			2
a lot of companies have taken a stab at improving the email experience			0
@entity4 recently started categorizing emails automatically and putting them in different tabs in your inbox , like social , promotions and updates			1
the popular third - party app mailbox used folders and gestures to make sorting through emails easy			1
that company was snapped up by @entity45			0
@entity7 seems to be heavily influenced by @entity46 's time - saving , reminder - centric approach ( not to mention its name )			1
it also borrows some neat features from @entity50			0
@entity7 works by grouping similar messages together , like bills , in what @entity5 calls " bundles			1
" you can schedule a bundle to only show up at specific intervals , say once a week			0
there 's no need to read all the words in an email just to get to the juicy bits			0
@entity7 will highlight what it thinks are the key parts of an email , like contact information , confirmation numbers or photos			2
it 's also tapping @entity5 for related information to save you a trip to the search engine			2
for example , if you 've set a reminder to call the dog groomer , the business 's contact information will show up automatically			0
messages can be turned into reminders , reminders can be snoozed , and important emails " pinned " while the rest are whisked away			0
@entity7 is currently only invite only			1
it is available as and @entity85 and @entity87 app , as well as a desktop view ( for @entity90 users only ) .			2
