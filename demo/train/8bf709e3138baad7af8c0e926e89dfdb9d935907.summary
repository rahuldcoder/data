-- after months of speculation and hype , the first biopic about @entity2 co-founder @entity1 hit theaters friday			1
" @entity1 , " directed by @entity12 and starring @entity13 as the iconic tech guru , spans much of @entity1 ' early career , from his hippie days at @entity9 in 1974 to the launch of the original @entity11 in 2001			1
and guess what ? although it omits or glosses over many chapters of @entity1 ' life , it 's not bad			2
this is the first dramatic feature film to focus solely on the longtime @entity2 ceo , who died in 2011			2
a second @entity1 movie , written by @entity22 and adapted from the best - selling @entity1 biography by @entity24 , is due as early as next year			2
@entity1 ' tumultuous life could probably fill three movies			2
but " @entity1 " focuses on his early years at @entity2 and ignores almost everything else			1
even though the two - hour movie spans 27 years , it makes little or no mention of @entity1 being adopted , his work at @entity32 , his search for his biological father , his leadership of @entity36 , his marriage to @entity38 , his late - career triumphs at @entity2 or the cancer that eventually killed him			1
it 's probably just as well			0
a movie with all that would be fascinating			0
it would also be four hours long			0
here are five things the movie gets right , and wrong			2
surprise ! @entity13 makes a convincing @entity1 if you know as @entity13 only as the handsome dimwit from " @entity50 " or lightweight movies like " @entity52 , " you may be pleasantly surprised			1
thanks in part to some subtle hair and makeup effects , he looks a lot like the @entity2 co-founder in many scenes			1
@entity13 nails @entity1 ' speech patterns , distinctive gait , hunched posture and manner of pacing , hands clasped , when speaking to a group			1
becoming @entity1 : @entity13 on his movie transformation he projects the intelligence in @entity1 ' eyes and his impatience with people he felt were wasting his time			1
and he effectively captures both sides of the notoriously mercurial @entity1 , who could be charismatic one moment and cruel the next			2
the movie does not have @entity13 portray the skeletal , cancer - stricken @entity1 of the late 2000s , however			1
that would have been asking a lot			0
@entity2 was founded over ... a plate of fruit ? the movie has some fun with the now - legendary story of how @entity1 and @entity83 launched @entity2 from the garage of @entity1 ' parents ' house in @entity87 , @entity88			1
several real - life characters -- electrical engineer @entity90 and early investor @entity91 -- show up at the house for the first time and gaze dubiously at @entity1 ' workspace and his motley crew of assistants			2
the scene where @entity1 and @entity91 negotiate @entity2 's first infusion of venture capital takes place in @entity1 ' parents ' dining room , with his mother serving the confused @entity106 bread and a plate of fruit			1
" @entity1 's a fruitarian , " one of his buddies says -- a reference to the unusual diet of her young son , who once went a whole week eating only apples			0
it 's not clear whether such a scene actually took place			0
according to @entity24 's book , which was written with @entity1 ' cooperation , the early business plan for @entity2 was hammered out over a period of weeks at @entity91 's house			1
there 's no mention in the book of what they ate			0
@entity83 is almost a minor character the shy @entity83 has never gotten enough credit for the early success of @entity2 , and he fades into the background in the movie as well , lost in the shadow cast by @entity1 ' larger - than - life persona			1
the real - life @entity83 did n't cooperate with the makers of " @entity1 " -- he 's apparently been consulting instead on the upcoming @entity22 biopic -- and maybe that explains why his role feels underwritten			1
the filmmakers also took some creative liberties with a few of @entity83 's most prominent scenes			0
one shows @entity83 startling @entity1 in his office late one night in 1985 by telling him that he 's leaving @entity2			1
in reality , @entity1 found out about @entity83 's departure when news leaked out in @entity151			0
the unassuming @entity83 , then working quietly as an engineer on the @entity2 computer , did n't feel that his leaving the company was important enough to warrant telling @entity1 directly			1
@entity1 ' dark side the movie has several scenes of @entity1 delivering dynamic speeches while reverent @entity2 employees respond with wild applause			1
but to its credit , the film does n't sugarcoat the more difficult parts of his personality			0
one scene shows @entity1 angrily kicking his girlfriend out of their house after she tells him she 's pregnant with the child who would become his daughter , @entity170			0
it 's not clear whether this actually happened , although in real life the couple broke up soon after and @entity1 disavowed paternity of the child			0
another shows him cheating @entity83 out of several thousand dollars ' payment for their work on a video game for @entity182 , a deception documented in @entity24 's book			0
@entity1 could be especially brutal with co-workers he did not respect			0
one scene shows him abruptly dismissing an engineer who did not share his enthusiasm for fonts			0
" are you firing me ? " the employee asks , surrounded by a roomful of stunned co-workers			0
" no , i already fired you ! " @entity1 yells back at him			0
" why are you still here ? " the movie also shows how @entity1 coldly refused to give stock options to several of @entity2 's earliest employees , including his old college pal and roommate @entity196			1
" @entity1 " milks this for drama in much the same way that " @entity207 " portrayed @entity202 's betrayal of his @entity204 classmate and @entity206 co-founder @entity203			2
the ' @entity209 ' ad the film ends in 1997 with @entity1 in a studio , recording voiceover narration for @entity2 's famous " think different " ad , the one that begins , " here 's to the crazy ones			2
" but while @entity1 in real life did record his voice for the tv spot , he ended up choosing a version by actor @entity224 instead			0
the movie 's final frames play @entity1 ' ( ok , @entity13 's ) " think different " narration over romanticized images of @entity2 engineers			1
coincidentally , that is almost the same ending that @entity22 favors for his version of the @entity1 story			0
we 'll have to wait to find out which works best .			0
