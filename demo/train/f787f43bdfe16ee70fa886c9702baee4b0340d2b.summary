-- this unholy mess replaces the artful ambition of " @entity3 " with torture , blood spray , kinky sex , twisted fun and a bizarro critique of @entity10 policy on illegal immigration			0
it 's a digital gorefest that expands on the faux trailer @entity16 included in " @entity17 , " the 2007 exploitation epic he unleashed with pal @entity14			0
@entity18 reviews " @entity21 " in his weekly video series , " at the movies with @entity18			2
" @entity16 and co-director @entity22 revel in the glorious sight of @entity25 - @entity10 actor @entity24 as " @entity21 , " a former federale out to kill a drug lord ( a never - lumpier @entity27 ) and assassinate a corrupt @entity29 senator ( a never - hammier @entity28 )			1
@entity24 , 66 , looks like four miles of torn - up road , but here he is convincingly kicking pretty - boy ass and bedding hotties such as @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35			1
is he redeemed ? your senses will be too numb to care			0
just to hear @entity24 deadpan the line " @entity21 do n't text " is tasty compensation			1
