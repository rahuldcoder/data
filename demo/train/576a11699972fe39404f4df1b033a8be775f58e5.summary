@entity0 -- the flare on a @entity5 platform that has been leaking gas for nearly a week has extinguished itself , energy giant @entity2 said saturday			1
there had been fears the flare could ignite the escaping gas at the @entity11 platform , about 150 miles ( 240 km ) east of the @entity13 city of @entity14 , potentially causing a huge explosion			1
@entity2 said it had received the first indication that the flare might be out at lunchtime on friday			2
this was subsequently confirmed by a second surveillance flight later that afternoon , the company said in a statement			0
" our sea vessels on location reported no further flare activity through the night , " it added saturday			2
@entity2 said friday that it was ready to push ahead with two operations intended to stop the leak , following five days during which the site had remained stable			1
" the first is to pump heavy mud directly into the well and the second is to drill relief wells to intervene at the source of the gas flow , " @entity2 said			1
the firm is " mobilizing all means to allow these options to be implemented , " it said			0
@entity2 has two drilling rigs in the area which will be used to drill the relief wells , it said			1
the company , which is still investigating the cause of the leak , estimates that 200,000 cubic meters of gas a day are escaping			2
" the gas cloud is fairly small in size and prevailing winds are blowing it away from the platform and dispersing it , " @entity2 said			1
" an exclusion zone around the platform has been set up by the @entity59 authorities taking into account a wide safety margin			0
" @entity13 environment secretary @entity62 said friday he had stressed the need for " absolute transparency " from @entity2 and the @entity59 government with regards to the situation			2
while the current environmental risk " continues to be minimal , " he said , the authorities will continue to be vigilant			0
nearly 240 workers were taken off the rig as the problem developed sunday			0
