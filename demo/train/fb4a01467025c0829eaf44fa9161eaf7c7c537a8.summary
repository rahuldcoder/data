over grazing rights on federal land			0
the @entity6 stopped rounding up rancher @entity10 's cattle and returned about 300 head of cattle to the open range to avoid the potential for violence , according to the @entity6 and @entity0 affiliate @entity16			1
the @entity18 - style controversy -- centering on a family that has been ranching in @entity5 since the 1800s -- drew armed militia groups from across the country to the cattleman 's side this week , especially after a @entity27 video captured a tussle teetering on violence between rangers and protesters			1
the @entity6 said @entity10 owed about $ 1 million in back fees because his cattle grazed on federal land			1
on saturday , hundreds of protesters gathered outside the @entity6 's cattle gate , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity36			1
some of them were armed			1
" due to escalating tensions , the cattle have been released from the enclosures in order to avoid violence and help restore order , " the @entity6 said in a prepared statement			1
also saturday , supporters of @entity10 , some of them armed , forced a temporary shutdown of northbound lanes of @entity50 near his ranch , the @entity45 said			1
" based on information about conditions on the ground , and in consultation with law enforcement , we have made a decision to conclude the cattle gather because of our serious concern about the safety of employees and members of the public , " said @entity6 director @entity52			1
the highway was reopened early saturday afternoon after protesters moved to the side of the road and stopping blocking it			0
but traffic was backed up for three miles in both directions , trooper @entity70 told @entity0			1
he said nobody in the crowd threatened violence			0
it was unclear whether @entity10 and the @entity6 had come to an agreement on how to end the long - running conflict			1
@entity80 sen. @entity79 , @entity81 , appealed for calm saturday and told out - of - state supporters to return home			1
" the dispute is over , the @entity6 is leaving , but emotions and tensions are still near the boiling point , and we desperately need a peaceful conclusion to this conflict , " @entity79 said in a statement			1
" i urge all the people involved to please return to your homes and allow the @entity6 officers to collect their equipment and depart without interference			1
" we are very close to a calm , peaceful resolution but it only takes the action of one individual to stir things up again and bring us back to the brink of violence and no one wants to see that happen , " @entity79 said			1
the growing protest came amid the @entity6 's decision to put an early end to a roundup of @entity10 's cattle , which the feds claim have been illegally grazing on federal land for 20 years			1
earlier saturday , @entity52 said that contracted wranglers and @entity80 rangers apparently made enough progress in rounding up cattle that belonged to @entity10 , who is challenging federal authority in a valley that his family settled in the @entity18 era			2
the roundup occurred near the scenic @entity124 at @entity125 , where @entity10 's ranch is located			2
" after one week , we have made progress in enforcing two recent court orders to remove the trespass cattle from public lands that belong to all @entity80 , " @entity52 said in a statement			2
he was referring to how two different federal judges ordered the removal of @entity10 's cattle			2
@entity10 's dispute with the government began around 1993 when the bureau changed grazing rules for the 600,000 - acre @entity140 area to protect an endangered desert tortoise , @entity0 affiliate @entity36 reported			0
@entity10 , who 's in his 60s , cites the @entity143 in asserting that the state of @entity5 holds sovereignty over the charging of grazing fees and , if he owes such a fee , he would pay it only to the local government -- not to the feds			0
@entity10 also contends his family has been ranching in the @entity151 on the @entity5 range since 1877 -- long before the @entity6 even existed and before the tortoise was declared endangered			0
@entity10 has said he owns 500 of the more than 900 cattle that federal officials had been planning to confiscate for illegal grazing , according to local media accounts , with each head worth about $ 1,000			2
the rancher could n't be immediately reached for comment saturday after the feds shut down the roundup			1
on wednesday , a scuffle between protesters and federal rangers was videotaped			0
@entity10 family members and their supporters confronted the rangers and angrily told them to leave @entity5			2
fearing that the cattle were being killed in the roundup , they also demanded to know why a backhoe and dump truck was being used , but federal officials later said the equipment was used to restore the range			1
for their part , federal rangers held tasers and barking dogs on leashes during the faceoff			0
federal officials say a police dog was kicked and officers were assaulted			0
@entity186 family members say they were thrown to the ground or jolted with a taser			0
in the end , the rangers got into their white suvs and drove away , a @entity27 video of the incident showed			2
the incident is under federal investigation			0
gov. @entity196 said saturday of the @entity6 decision : " the safety of all individuals involved in this matter has been my highest priority			2
given the circumstances , today 's outcome is the best we could have hoped for			0
i appreciate that the @entity205 and the @entity6 were willing to listen to the concerns of the people of @entity5			0
" @entity209 sheriff @entity208 issued a press release late saturday night saying he mediated the agreement between the @entity10 familiy and @entity6			0
" i want to stress to all of you that as the sheriff of @entity215 i can not interfere with the federal government when it is operating on federal land , " @entity208 said			0
" and because this is @entity6 property , it is in their jurisdiction			0
but when a group of protesters threaten civil unrest or violence in this county -- it is my job to step in and ensure the safety of citizens			0
" @entity0 's @entity230 , @entity231 and @entity232 contributed to this report .			0
