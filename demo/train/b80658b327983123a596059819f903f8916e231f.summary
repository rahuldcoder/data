has been forced to revise a @entity4 - themed ad campaign after it appeared to score an own goal with its latest message			1
the ad , which was on seen on tv and on local buses , featured a crestfallen boy named @entity11 expressing his hope that @entity13 would win football 's biggest tournament after his father placed all his savings on that result -- which of course , they did			1
the jokes started to spill out across the world following @entity13 's remarkable 7 - 1 victory over hosts @entity23 in the semifinal			2
" cheer up kid , your dad bet on @entity13 ! he 's so rich , you do n't even need to go to college any more ! " quipped @entity29 , host of " @entity30			2
" reply but the quick - thinking @entity1 has used the attention -- including from @entity36 late night talk show hosts -- to counter with another advertisement , this time highlighting the ongoing nature of problem gambling			1
the followup ad has one of @entity11 's friends asking , " your dad 's team won			0
did you get your savings back ? " to which @entity11 replies , " no , dad never stops ... he wants to bet one more time			0
" the plaintive conversation is followed up with the line , " often , the people who suffer from problem gambling are n't the gamblers			1

in addition , 15 people were arrested last month for allegedly receiving illegal football bets equivalent to us $ 640,000 , police said			0
however , despite the societal impact that gambling has , @entity2 revised its laws in 2006 to liberalize gaming in the city , a move that has brought international operators to @entity2 and made it one @entity91 's casino hubs			1
the @entity1 campaign -- now updated to reflect the father 's voracious gambling habits -- will run until july 23			2
