@entity0 -- after weeks of fighting and hundreds of deaths , some semblance of peace may be coming to the @entity6 -- at least temporarily			2
@entity8 secretary - general @entity7 and @entity10 secretary of state @entity9 announced thursday that an unconditional humanitarian cease - fire will begin at 8 a.m. friday in @entity0 ( 1 a.m. et )			1
it will last 72 hours -- or three days -- " unless extended , " the @entity8 and @entity10 said in a joint statement			2
" during this time , the forces on the ground will remain in place , " the statement said			0
@entity19 has accepted the cease - fire , officials in its prime minister 's office texted @entity1			1
so , too , has @entity21 , a spokesman for the militant fundamentalist @entity24 organization texted			2
the cease - fire is meant to allow humanitarian aid to reach civilians in @entity0 caught up in the violence , some of whom have seen their neighborhoods hit hard and loved ones killed , hurt or displaced			1
the aid will include food , care for the injured and burial of the dead			0
as all this is going on , @entity19 and @entity38 officials should be meeting in @entity40 to try to reach " a durable cease - fire , " the @entity8 and @entity10 statement said			1
" the parties will be able to raise issues of concern in these negotiations			0
" will they be able to reach a breakthrough ? the past does n't suggest that is likely , at least anything that will lead to a solution to issues that @entity19 and @entity38 have been grappling with for decades			1
and the animosity between @entity19 and @entity21 , which controls @entity0 , runs especially deep , with both sides accusing each other of putting each others civilians at risk			1
@entity9 called the talks -- to be mediated by @entity59 and to include a small @entity10 delegation -- " a lull of opportunity ... to try to find a way to ... obtain a sustainable cease - fire , " while admitting there are " no guarantees			1
" as @entity9 noted , " everyone knows it has not been easy to get to this point , and everyone knows it will not be easy to get beyond this point			0
" @entity38 negotiator @entity73 offered similar sentiments on the new talks , which he said will include " all @entity38 factions " -- not just @entity21			1
" it 's a difficult road , " said the longtime @entity38 official			1
" i am hoping against hope that we can ( make ) every possible effort , with the help of everyone out there , ( to ) reach a permanent cease - fire			1
" @entity8 official alludes to potential war crimes the latest round of violence , which started earlier this summer , has been particularly bad			2
at least 1,452 people have been killed in @entity0 , and 8,360 wounded , during the current conflict , @entity0 @entity91 spokesman @entity90 said			1
that 's more than the 1,417 @entity38 that the @entity95 said died in the 22 days of @entity19 's @entity96 , which spanned 2008 and 2009			1
those killed in the ongoing hostilities -- which are tied to the @entity19 military 's @entity99 -- include 327 children and 166 women , the @entity0 health ministry reports			1
the bloodshed prompted the @entity8 ' top human rights official to warn that war crimes may have been committed , accusing @entity19 of " deliberate defiance of obligations ( to ) international law			1
" @entity8 @entity110 @entity109 referred to the shelling of homes , schools , hospitals and @entity8 " premises , " while insisting , " we can not allow this impunity , we can not allow this lack of accountability to go on			2
" " none of this appears , to me , to be accidental , " @entity109 said			0
the scale of the violence , as well as the international condemnation of it , could drive both sides to peace			0
but even if it does , some @entity38 -- like @entity128 , who is in a @entity8 camp after her home was destroyed -- are n't looking forward to the future			1
" life is meaningless , " @entity133 said			0
" ... what dreams in life can we have now that everything is ruined ? " more @entity19 reservists called up news of the cease - fire did n't stop the violence			1
almost immediately afterward , warning sirens went off around @entity19 -- with its military announcing later it had intercepted one rocket from @entity0 , while two others landed in the @entity147			1
@entity19 has been protected very effectively from @entity21 rockets by its @entity150 defense system , though a few have hit land			1
that includes a rocket that struck a neighborhood thursday in @entity157 , about 20 miles from @entity0 , seriously injuring a man and setting a car afire , @entity19 spokesman @entity153 said			1
three civilians have been killed in @entity19 since the conflict began , while many more have been forced to take shelter as rockets rained overhead			1
but the brunt of the conflict has been born by @entity19 's military , with 61 of its soldiers dying in recent weeks , with five of those deaths occurring thursday evening			2
they will get help soon , with @entity169 announcing the call - up of 16,000 reservists			0
that will bring the total number of reservists activated since the start of the operation to 86,000 , a military spokeswoman said			0
@entity19 has accused @entity21 of hiding weapons , including rockets , in schools and launching attacks from near shelters -- a fact that , it says , has contributed to civilian deaths			2
many outside @entity19 are n't convinced			2
@entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 and @entity189 have pulled their ambassadors out of @entity191 to protest the @entity19 offensive			2
even the @entity10 -- an ally of @entity19 -- believes " the @entity19 need to do more " to prevent civilian deaths , @entity194 spokesman col. @entity193 told reporters			2
still , such calls have n't stopped the @entity10 from agreeing to @entity19 's request to resupply it with several types of ammunition , a @entity10 defense official told @entity1 on condition of anonymity			1
it 's not an emergency sale , the official said			0
the items being bought include tank rounds and illumination rounds , the @entity194 said			0
nor will a cease - fire stop @entity19 's attempts to destroy @entity21 ' network of tunnels that @entity19 prime minister @entity215 says is the first phase of the demilitarization of @entity0			1
while " neither side will advance ... @entity19 will be able to continue its defensive operations for those tunnels that are behind its lines , " @entity9 explained			2
' we are tired , and we have had so much loss of life ' meanwhile , @entity0 is reeling			0
more than 219,000 @entity38 are packed into 86 shelters across @entity0 , the @entity8 said			1
that works out to about 12 % of all of @entity0 's population			0
clean water is inaccessible for most			0
and some 3,600 people have lost their homes			0
" we can not supply electricity " for hospitals , sewage treatment or domestic use , said @entity231 , deputy chairman of the @entity232 in @entity0			0
" this is a disaster			0
" @entity238 , the @entity0 health spokesman , said health care workers are struggling to deal with the relentless stream of dead and wounded			0
" the hospitals in @entity0 yesterday had a very difficult time			0
all the hospital morgues were flooding with dead bodies , and the injured were laying on hospital floors because of the lack of hospital beds , " said @entity243			0
count @entity249 among those @entity38 hoping , praying that the misery ends			2
the violence forced him to flee his home , with his five children and " just the clothes on my back			0
" " we are tired , and we have had so much loss of life , " @entity260 , 32 , said of himself and fellow @entity38			0
" we want to live with our children a life of dignity , like the rest of the world			0
" inside a @entity21 tunnel what is @entity21 ' endgame in @entity0 ? what is @entity19 's endgame in @entity0 ? opinion : @entity0 peace struggle drains me of hope what you need to know about the @entity19 - @entity21 @entity277 @entity1 's @entity278 reported from @entity0 ; and @entity279 reported and wrote from @entity280			1
@entity1 's @entity281 , @entity282 , @entity283 , @entity284 , @entity285 , @entity286 , @entity287 , @entity288 and @entity289 contributed to this report .			0
