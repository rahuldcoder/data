@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's poverty rate is now the worst since 1993 , according to a shocking report last week from the @entity6			1
over 46 million people are living in poverty , 2.6 million more than in 2009 and the poverty rate has reached 15.1 percent			1
the recession has compounded decades of growing economic inequality , structural poverty , and urban decay			1
with the projections that unemployment will remain high for several years , these numbers are not likely to improve			0
making matters worse , as @entity19 at the @entity20 noted , " safety net programs run by the federal and state governments are helping millions of families avoid poverty , but thee programs could be subject to cuts at the federal and state level because of continuing deficit and debt problems			1
" despite the enormity of this social problem , @entity4 politicians in either party rarely discuss the subject			1
since the poor do n't tend to vote in high rates or contribute much in campaign funds , they do n't get a place at the table in @entity42 with the @entity4 poverty rate being the highest in the developed world according to the @entity46 , this statistic marks a terrible failure for the nation as a whole			1
most republicans have tended to avoid the question of poverty because they reject the notion that government can do anything to solve it			1
for decades , conservatives have railed against welfare programs for creating a cycle of dependency			0
republicans and conservative democrats ultimately believe that the only way to reduce poverty is to grow the economy			2
but poverty has been a problem in good times and bad			2
@entity66 avoid tackling the problem because they fear the political consequences of being tagged as big government liberals			0
in 1996 , when president @entity71 signed the welfare reform act that ended @entity73 ( @entity73 ) , he effectively took poverty off his party 's agenda			1
those who support government programs for the poor have been haunted by the political backlash against the @entity80			1
it was during the 1960s , an era of unprecedented economic growth , that president @entity84 and allied @entity66 decided to tackle the problem of poverty in this wealthy nation			2
president @entity87 had started to explore an anti-poverty program in 1963 under the guidance of @entity90 , the chairman of the @entity91 , but @entity87 was assassinated before he could take action			0
when @entity84 heard about the program shortly after taking office , he said it was the kind of initiative he could support			0
@entity84 , who had been inspired by the @entity97 and grew up amid poverty in @entity99 , sympathized with the plight of the poor and believed that the government could and should so something about it : " that 's my kind of program			2
i 'll find money for it one way or another			0
if i have to , i 'll take away money from things to get money for people			0
" to build a legislative coalition in favor of the @entity80 in 1964 , @entity84 enlisted the support of liberals in @entity119 as well as the conservative democrat @entity120 of @entity121 , who won over the votes of many in the party who usually opposed new federal programs			1
@entity127 , and other conservatives in the party , had constituencies who struggled with economic hardship			2
in his address to @entity119 in march 1964 , @entity84 said : " what you are being asked to consider is not a simple or an easy program			2
but poverty is not a simple or an easy enemy			2
it can not be driven from the land by a single attack on a single front			0
were this so , we would have conquered poverty long ago			2
nor can it be conquered by government alone			0
for decades @entity4 labor and @entity4 business , private institutions and private individuals have been engaged in strengthening our economy and offering new opportunity to those in need			1
we need their help , their support , and their full participation			0
through this program we offer new incentives and new opportunities for cooperation , so that all the energy of our nation , not merely the efforts of government , can be brought to bear on our common enemy			0
" the @entity80 claimed some notable accomplishments			1
according to the historian @entity174 , " between 1965 and 1972 , the government transfer programs lifted about half the poor over the poverty line			2
" many programs , such as @entity176 , became popular across the nation and perceived as integral to the well being of struggling @entity4			1
even as the policies were making great strides , @entity179 attacked the @entity80 as a waste of federal money that only helped elected officials			1
many @entity66 urban machine politicians lambasted the @entity186 € ” a part of the war on poverty that put money into the hands of local organizations to shape anti-poverty initiatives -- because they felt the dollars were winding up in the hands of left - wing organizations who then opposed them			0
many groups representing the poor felt the @entity80 did not go far enough			1
for decades afterward , attempts to reduce levels of poverty through government action were unpopular			0
indeed , @entity73 , a product of the @entity97 commonly known as welfare , became the focus of conservatives who called for eliminating the program and younger democrats who felt it needed to be reformed			0
reforming welfare gained more attention than the problem the program was originally meant to solve			0
today 's silence about poverty is striking			0
very few presidential candidates ever bring up the issue			1
there have been a few in each party , such as @entity222 for the @entity66 and @entity223 for the @entity224 , but in general this is the cause that has no champion			0
the new data from the @entity6 , comes at a crucial time , with government programs on the chopping block as @entity42 focuses on cutting the budget deficit			0
candidates running for office in 2012 should be forced to confront this issue and explain what they intend to do about it			1
proposals such as public jobs , education reform , and tax incentives to rebuild blighted areas must be discussed			0
there must also be strong consideration given to protecting -- and even expanding -- state and local services for the poor despite the current obsession with budget cuts			0
unless voters and the media help to make this an issue in the campaign , the problem will likely only become worse			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity258 .			1

census bureau reported sharp rise in @entity4 in poverty
@entity264 : neither party seems willing to address the issue
he says the @entity80 succeeded in helping many
