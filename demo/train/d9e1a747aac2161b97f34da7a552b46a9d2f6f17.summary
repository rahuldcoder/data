a small mammal with fluffy red - orange fur , a short bushy tail , and an adorable rounded face has leapt onto the raccoon family tree			0
scientists at the @entity6 in @entity7 announced thursday the discovery of a new species of mammal called the olinguito ( pronounced oh - lin - @entity13 - toe )			1
if you 're a fan of long technical names , this one is @entity17			2
such a discovery is rare			0
the olinguito is the first mammalian carnivore species to be newly identified in the @entity21 in 35 years , according to @entity22 , curator of mammals at the @entity6 's @entity24			1
his research group 's study on the creature is being published in the journal @entity30			2
researchers argue that the olinguito should be considered the smallest living member of the raccoon family , which includes other animals that make us go " awww " such as coatis and kinkajous			2
the @entity6 describes the olinguito 's appearance as a cross between a house cat and a teddy bear			2
cats , bears , and olinguitos belong to the @entity49 order			0
this animal had been seen before by humans , @entity22 said , but it had been " a case of mistaken identity			2
" " it was in museums , it 's been in zoos , and its dna had even been sequenced , but no one had connected the pieces and looked close enough to realize , basically , the significance of this remarkable and this beautiful animal , " @entity22 said			0
previously , scientists had assumed that olinguitos were members of their sister species , the olingos , @entity22 said			1
olingos are larger , less furry and have longer faces than the newly discovered species			2
tracking the olinguito @entity22 began his detective work in pursuit of the new species when he set out about a decade ago to comprehensive study of olingos			1
behind the scenes at the @entity80 in 2003 , he remembers pulling out a drawer of skins and skulls that did n't look like any animal he had ever seen before , or that had been reported by zoologists			0
the teeth and skull were smaller and shaped differently than olingos , and the coat was denser			0
records indicated to @entity91 that such specimens came from the northern @entity93 about 5,000 to 9,000 feet above sea level , which is much higher than olingo habitats			1
@entity22 and colleagues worked with @entity97 , a zoologist in @entity98 , who had shot a few seconds of video that appeared to depict the animal			1
they teamed up in @entity98 in 2006 , using @entity97 's knowledge of cloud forest habitats to pick the best spots to investigate			1
cloud forests are " cloaked in fog , " @entity22 said			1
on their very first night on the pursuit , the team found a real , living olinguito			2
seeing the fluffy tree - dweller for the first time , @entity22 felt " sheer elation , just incredible excitement but at the same time almost disbelief			0
this animal had been missed by everyone			0
" even people who live in the @entity93 had the same confusion about olinguitos being olingos , because humans do n't hunt them and the creatures stay in the trees , @entity22 said			0
ancient primate could be a missing link how it lives the researchers found out that the olinguito primarily eats fruits , but also insects and nectar , and its activity is mostly at night			1
the animal lives in the trees and can jump from one to another			2
mothers raise a single baby at a time			0
at about 2.5 feet long from nose tip to tail tip , the olinguito weighs about 2 pounds and is a little smaller than a house cat			1
dna analysis confirmed that while olinguitos and olingos both belong to the raccoon family , they are " sister groups , " in the same way that humans are closely related to chimpanzees			2
the olinguito 's misty high - elevation habitats in @entity151 and @entity98 , and the tendency for the animal to stay in the trees , have helped keep the species relatively obscure to scientists until now , @entity22 said			1
it turns out , according to @entity22 , there are four subspecies of olinguitos , differing in color -- shades of reds , orange and browns -- and size and living in various sections of the @entity93			0
new species of mice , bats and shrews are more commonly discovered , but these animals are tiny and hard to tell apart , @entity22 said			0
prior to the olinguito , the most recent mammal to be discovered in the @entity21 was a small weasel from the @entity93 -- the same area and habitat where the olinguitos live , he said			0
" it shows us that there 's a long way to go to exploring the whole world , but especially maybe these cloud forests , " @entity22 said			1
more olinguitos may be found in other @entity188 countries with cloud forests in the future , according to the @entity6			1
the olinguito is not yet considered an endangered species , but there are threats to its home environment , @entity22 said			1
many have such forests been chopped down			0
" we also kind of hope that in telling this story to the world about the olinguito , that this beautiful new animal serves as something of an ambassador for those embattled cloud forest habitats			1
" the zoo olinguito @entity22 's group has " discovered " the olinguito , but it been evolving as an independent species for about 3 to 4 million years , he said			1
one olinguito whose history @entity22 's group studied was exhibited in the @entity215 during its lifetime as if it were an olingo			1
the creature came from the mountains of @entity151 to the @entity219 in 1967 , courtesy of a @entity222 couple with a love of raccoon family members , @entity22 said			1
it was also in the @entity226 in @entity7 and the @entity227 , where it passed away			0
dna from this olinguito shows that it is clearly not an olingo , @entity22 said			1
the wife of the animal 's keeper told @entity22 , " we always thought there was something strange about that olingo , " he said			0
she told @entity91 this particular animal moved from zoo to zoo because she would n't breed with the olingos around her			0
" it was n't because she was fussy , it was because she was not at all even the same species , " @entity22 said			0
with the olinguito research announcement , the oddball animal 's aloofness has been vindicated			0
@entity250 zoo angers visitors by passing off hairy @entity253 mastiff dog as lion follow @entity255 on @entity256 and @entity257 .			0

the olinguito weighs about 2 pounds and is 2.5 feet long
this creature lives in cloud forests in @entity98 and @entity151
previously it was mistaken for its sister species , the olingo
