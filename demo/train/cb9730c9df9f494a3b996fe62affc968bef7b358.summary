-- the sounds of battle echo across a desolate stretch of land just east of @entity5 , @entity6 's biggest base in @entity7			1
as it turns out , it 's just battle practice			2
" training exercises on our big weapons to include our small arms , " explains sergeant 1st class @entity9 , of the 381st @entity11			2
" just put some ammo down range			2
the @entity7 people let us do this to make sure our weapons stay functional for future missions			1
" he says rehearsals like this help his troops keep their skills sharp , adding that they 're skills @entity6 troops need to keep @entity7 safe			1
but villagers living around the @entity30 could n't disagree more -- they argue @entity6 military exercises here are putting them in danger			1
" kids wander around and touch what they find , " says @entity34 , a nomadic shepherd who is sitting across the road watching soldiers fire volleys of rounds into the mountainside			0
" these kids , they do n't know what is and is n't full of explosives			0
" a handful of boys standing around him are waiting for the soldiers to leave			0
they 'll scavenge for left over metal casings and fragments to sell for much needed cash for their families			1
one boy tells us one kilogram , or about 2.2 pounds , of scrap metal will earn him roughly 150 @entity58 , or $ 3			1
@entity34 lost a leg and an arm to @entity62 landmines in the 1980s , and he worries for the safety of his 13 year - old son , @entity64 -- one of the boys who will soon be out in the range searching for metal			1
according to @entity71 , chief of operations of the @entity72 of @entity7 ( or @entity73 ) , at least 12 civilians from villages surrounding the range area have been maimed by unexploded ordnance , or @entity75 , in the last four years			1
at least one was killed			2
the shepherds are also at risk			0
they graze their sheep on slopes littered with bullets , grenades , and in a recent case , an anti-aircraft rocket , according to the @entity6 military			1
in a frayed cloth tent next to the range , we find 17 year - old @entity89			2
he winces from pain as he tells us how he lost part of his left arm			2
we take our herds to the mountain site for feeding			0
i saw something there , " describes @entity89			0
" when i picked it up and then hit it with a stone it exploded			0
" his father , @entity102 , recounts how he rushed his son to nearby @entity5 for emergency treatment			0
he says they were turned away by local guards at the gate			0
a @entity6 military official at the base said he was n't aware of the case			1
@entity89 was eventually taken to the @entity111 , and then transferred to an eye hospital to save his sight			0
four weeks after the explosion , he 's still wearing sunglasses to protect his injured eyes			0
the 17 - year - old also lost part of his other arm in a similar explosion several years ago			2
he believes that in both incidents he was hurt by unexploded @entity6 ordnance			1
as @entity102 describes what happened to his son , his anger grows			0
" it was n't just something thrown from the sky			0
if it was n't for the @entity6 doing their military exercises here , why would my son have been blown up ? " @entity102 's leg was severed by a @entity62 era landmine , but he says it 's @entity6 forces who are now sowing destruction			1
" we ca n't do any other kind of work , " says @entity102 , " we do n't have houses and we ca n't go to the cities			0
but they , the @entity6 , have made this place like fire for us			1
" all along the 20 kilometer ( 12.4 mile ) stretch of flat terrain at @entity30 is wide open land , with very little to indicate there 's any danger			1
fencing is nonexistent , and the few signs there warning that this area is a firing range are in faded @entity155			1
for a largely illiterate population that speaks mostly @entity158 and @entity159 , it 's almost impossible for them to understand their lives are at risk			0
three decades of successive wars made @entity7 one of the most heavily mined countries in the world			1
but now , @entity167 account for three times as many casualties as mines -- and most of them are children , according to @entity73			2
@entity174 estimates that roughly 10 million landmines still remain in @entity7			1
most of them are @entity62 made , the deadly legacy left over from @entity7 's war with that country			1
but these days , @entity181 , @entity73 's chief of operations says @entity6 forces need to fully recognize their responsibility -- and that to a degree , they have failed in their duty to protect @entity7 civilians			1
" they should do something to make sure that the civilians are protected after the war is finished or after the training is finished , " says @entity71			2
@entity5 's deputy garrison commander , @entity193 , is in charge of the range			2
he acknowledges the @entity6 military needs to do more at various sites throughout the country , and says he empathizes with the local population			1
" i 'm a grandfather and i 'm hearing these stories of kids out there getting injured , " he says			0
" i have seven grandkids			0
my oldest is 13 , my youngest is seven			0
so , in addition to being a concerned grandparent , i know how i 'd feel if my kids got injured			0
i think we have to do a better job of marking			0
" to that end , he says the military plans to soon place big concrete blocks about 200 meters apart on the flat terrain part of the range -- and intends to mark them with the international symbols that indicate a minefield			1
" we think using those markings , red on one side , white on the other , is something they 'll recognize , " @entity217 explains			0
" the second part of that would be to have a warning or safety warnings , " adds @entity217 , " ' unexploded ordnance or impact area ' -- written in there in three languages -- @entity155 , @entity159 and @entity158 -- because that 's the languages that are understood here			1
" he adds that people in the area know it 's a firing range , " but usually economics drive them to go out there and scavenge metals			1
" as members of the 381st @entity11 finish up their exercises , they pick up spent shell casings from the road			0
@entity245 says his unit does the right thing			0
" i 'd say that we 're really big on picking up the metal that we lay down , " he explains			2
" we pick up the trash and we pick up after ourselves			0
we brought it with us , we 're taking it back with us			0
" still , these troops wo n't venture far beyond the road because they know there are decades worth of explosive remnants of war out there			0
but @entity261 has other worries			0
" the remains from the foot solders are n't that dangerous , " he says , " it 's the things that are dropped first from the helicopters -- those things are very dangerous and lots of people have lost body parts because of that			0
" the range is used to test fire everything from 40mm grenades to 2.75 - inch rockets fired by helicopters , all the way up to @entity274 , says @entity217			2
20mm rounds are fired off @entity282 jets , and 30mm rounds are fired off the @entity285 helicopters			0
we asked what posed the greatest risk to civilians in the area			1
@entity217 said that while he 's not an explosive ordnance disposal expert , it 's " usually the 40mm rounds , 40mm grenades that are usually fired with a shoulder , a rifle , @entity297 19 , or some other weapons system			2
" casualty reports from @entity30 started coming in to macca in 2008			1
@entity71 says it 's been tough to communicate with the @entity6			1
ahead of the troop withdrawal from @entity7 by the end of 2014 , he 's worried about @entity167 that will be left behind by coalition forces			1
" we need to know the possible location of unexploded ordnance , " says a somewhat frustrated @entity71			1
" we need to know the possible areas that are affected by improvised explosive devices			0
we need to have information ... before the international community forces leave -- they should pass it on to us so that the mine action program of @entity7 is aware of these problems and able to address those legacies of the war in the years to come			1
" the @entity6 military says it is aware of the dangers			1
" we 're at war , " explains @entity217 , " and you know , war is an inherently dangerous business			0
and we try to mitigate that danger by consolidating those routine , so to speak , firing and expenditure of weapon munitions into a controlled area as best we can			2
" @entity217 , who arrived in @entity7 in february , says he 's not sure exactly what will be done to clean up @entity75 from the @entity30 , but says a concerted effort is now being made to minimize future casualties			1
but for @entity89 and others living close to the range , it 's too late			2
they say this is their land , and they have nowhere else to go .			0

unexploded ordnance left on one range in @entity7 killed 12 civilians in last four years
children living around @entity30 scavenge leftover arms from the range for scrap metal
