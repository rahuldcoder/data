-- i started to see influenza - like illnesses starting roughly around mid-december , and within a week knew that 2013 was going to be a bad year			1
in my 12 years of practice in @entity5 , this flu season definitely ranks as one of the worst i 've seen			1
however , i also see no reason to be alarmed that we have a public health threat			0
what we are dealing with is a well - known virus			0
this outbreak is worse than average due to , more than anything , poor timing			1
there are three main factors to consider in evaluating the intense flu activity across the country			2
one is the virus itself			0
both the medical community and the general public alike worry someday we will encounter a " superbug			0
" we fear a virus that is extremely potent at causing disease , replicating , resisting our treatment and killing the host			0
though the predominant strain this year may be slightly more potent than average based on the number of cases we are seeing , there is no indication that this virus is markedly different from what we 've seen in other years			1
opinion : next time , get vaccinated earlier the percentage of influenza - related deaths is not higher than in previous outbreaks			1
the @entity44 also has found no viral strains this season that are resistant to neuraminidase inhibitors , the drugs that we use to treat patients once they develop the flu			1
so , we need not worry too much about the virus			0
the second factor to consider is the effectiveness of the flu shot			2
this year 's flu vaccine is well matched to the strains of flu that have been circulating			2
according to the @entity44 , more than 90 % of the identified viral types are covered by the current vaccine			0
in other words , we can not blame an ineffective vaccine for the bad outbreak			2
finally , we need to look at environmental factors			0
the unusually warm weather this winter should not be contributing to the severity of the outbreak			2
why ? because last year , it was also unusually warm , and at the time we hypothesized the weather was partly responsible for a milder than normal flu season			1
clearly , warm weather ca n't both enhance and suppress the spread of influenza			1
instead , we must focus on what 's different from previous years			0
unlike last year , when the flu showed up late , this flu season came early			1
most importantly , the peak incidence of illness happened to coincide almost exactly with the onset of the holiday season , which is critical to take into account			1
if someone were trying to develop a way to disseminate an illness , he would first devise a way to weaken the population 's immune system , and then bring people together to spread the disease			2
in essence , that is what the holiday season does			1
opinion : @entity97 flunks its health exam because of holiday preparations and parties , people tolerate less sleep			2
stress around the holidays generally goes up			0
combine those with poor eating habits and overindulgences that are typical in festive times , and the immune system gets weakened			2
once a person contracts the flu virus , he or she is contagious approximately 12 to 24 hours before the peak onset of symptoms , and is often contagious up to 24 hours after resolution of fever			1
during this very social time of year , many of these sick people are either tolerating their symptoms to join big groups of friends or family , or coming together honestly unaware that they are contagious			0
as a result , we have the perfect storm for the spread of influenza			1
in sum , our flu season this year is simply a product of poor timing			1
health : your top flu questions answered the peak onset of the flu just happened to coincide with a period when we have weakened our immune system and congregated in large gatherings to , among other things , disseminate disease			1
the flu strains have been well anticipated and carry no resistance to our treatment			0
we have no reason to panic			0
i recommend that everyone de-stress from the holiday stresses , wash their hands , eat healthy , exercise and get plenty of sleep			0
stay home if you are sick			0
and in good time , this too shall pass			0

@entity165 : this flu season definitely ranks as one of the worst i 've seen
@entity165 : this outbreak is worse than average due to , more than anything , poor timing
he says the holiday period was the perfect storm for the spread of influenza
@entity165 : the peak onset of the flu coincided with a time when our immunity was down
