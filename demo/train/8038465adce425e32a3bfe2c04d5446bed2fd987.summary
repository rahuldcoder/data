-- federal officials say a plane crash that killed 265 people was caused in part by a rudder system design featured in various @entity7 models			1
@entity8 crashed in a residential area of @entity10 , @entity11 , soon after taking off from @entity12 on november 12 , 2001			1
all 260 people onboard died , along with five people on the ground			0
according to a recommendation issued this week by the @entity19 , the plane 's vertical stabilizer likely separated because of " the first officer 's unnecessary and excessive rudder pedal inputs			2
" but those inputs were likely caused in part by " characteristics of the @entity26 - 600 rudder system design			1
" two families of @entity7 planes use a system design that limits available rudder pedal deflection as airspeed decreases , according to the safety board			1
" consequently , at high airspeeds require lighter pedal forces ... to obtain maximum available rudder than at low speeds , " the safety board wrote			2
the safety board notes the circumstances of flight 587 are similar to a 2008 accident involving an @entity42			0
@entity43 190 experienced " in - flight upset " and landed in @entity44			0
three passengers suffered serious injuries			0
the popular @entity42 family could also be affected			0
the @entity51 - based company 's website says it sold more than 3,200 a320 planes worldwide			2
" the @entity7 320 family is also susceptible to potentially hazardous rudder pedal inputs at higher airspeeds , " the safety board wrote			1
safety board officials recommended the @entity59 review options for modifying some @entity7 planes " to provide increased protection from potentially hazardous rudder pedal inputs			1
" no one from @entity7 was immediately available for comment early saturday .			0

federal officials say some @entity7 planes have a potentially hazardous rudder system design
the design may have *contributed* to a crash in @entity11 in 2001
@entity19 urges @entity51 safety officials to consider modifying planes
