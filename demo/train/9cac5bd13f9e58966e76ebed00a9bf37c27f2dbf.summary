it 's something you do n't often hear from the leaders of a terrorist group known for violence : we 're sorry			2
but that 's just what the head of @entity8 said in a video message sunday , apologizing for a hospital attack in @entity12 earlier this month that left dozens of people dead			1
the attackers were directed not to assault the hospital or mosque in an attack against a @entity18 @entity20 compound on december 5 , but one fighter made a mistake and attacked the hospital , leader @entity24 says in the video			1
" we confess to this mistake and fault			0
we offer our apologies and condolences to the families of the victims , " @entity24 said in the video , which was published by @entity8 media outlet @entity29			1
" we did not want your lost ones ; we did not target them on purpose			0
this is not of our religion or our morals			0
" it 's unusual to see " such a direct , fast , public apology " from @entity8 , @entity43 national security analyst @entity42 said			1
" @entity46 leaders seem to be waking up to the fact that if they position themselves as the defenders of @entity50 , their large - scale killing of @entity53 civilians needs to stop , " @entity42 said			0
the apology comes after @entity18 government officials released surveillance video showing the hospital under attack			1
the surveillance footage showed patients nervously looking out of the hospital windows , then running after an explosion			1
in another clip , patients and staff huddle in a hallway			0
they watch as an attacker walks calmly toward them , activates an explosive and lobs it in their direction			0
" we saw what the @entity18 channel broadcast : a gunman entering a hospital			1
... we did not order him to do so , and we are not pleased with what he did , " @entity24 said			0
" moreover , it wronged us and pained us , because we do not fight in this manner			0
" the @entity84 government has designated @entity8 as a foreign terrorist organization and says the group has orchestrated " numerous high - profile terrorist attacks			1
" sunday 's apology , though rare , is n't the first time @entity8 or its affiliates have apologized			1
in november , @entity92 rebels with @entity8 ties apologized for mistakenly beheading a wounded rebel fighter after assuming he supported @entity92 president @entity95			2
in 2009 , an @entity8 spokesman released a video message offering condolences to " unintended @entity53 victims " killed in attacks			1
and in 2007 , @entity42 said , former @entity8 chief @entity101 said that @entity53 victims killed by @entity104 " are not the intended targets			2
" behind the scenes , @entity42 said , leaders of the group have expressed concerns about the impact such attacks would have on the group 's reputation			2
" we know from the documents recovered at the bin laden compound in @entity117 by @entity118 in may 2011 , @entity8 's leaders were often writing to each other privately and also to groups they are associated with about the need to minimize civilian ( @entity53 ) casualties and often wrote about the damage to the @entity8 brand that killing civilians had achieved by @entity8 operations in @entity127 , " @entity42 said			2
" but the straightforward public apology ... is a new development			1
" in sunday 's message , @entity24 said the group would financially compensate families of victims in the hospital attack			1
but the militant leader also stressed that the group 's fighters would n't shy away from going after targets that have ties to @entity84 drones			2
that 's why they hit the @entity144 compound that day , he said			2
since the attack , @entity18 government officials have repeatedly stated there are no drone operations based at the compound			1
@entity24 said places that help @entity84 drones by spying , providing information or offering intelligence are legitimate targets			0
" we have a long list of these places			0
in case they continue , we will continue			0
we will reach them , because we defend ourselves , " he said			0
" we made a mistake			0
we accept responsibility and we are continuing with our @entity163			0
