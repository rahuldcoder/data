-- @entity2 leader @entity1 appeared monday either to not know that demonstrators in cities throughout @entity2 are calling for an end to his rule or not accept it , according to excerpts from the interview , which a @entity11 official described as " delusional			1
" " no demonstration at all in the streets , " he told @entity14 and the @entity15 in a joint interview carried out at a restaurant in @entity18 , excerpts of which were posted on the @entity15 's website			1
told by the @entity15 's @entity22 that he had seen demonstrators in the streets that morning , @entity1 asked , " are they supporting us ? " @entity1 , wearing sunglasses and clad in brown tribal clothing , refused to accept the reporter 's assertion that they were not			1
" no. no one against us			0
against me for what ? " he repeated his assertion that he is not president , but one of the people			2
" they love me , all my people with me , they love me all			2
they will die to protect me , my people			2
no , no. " asked why his people had captured and were holding the nation 's second - largest city , @entity42 , @entity1 said it was @entity44 , not the @entity2 people , who had done so			1
" @entity44 , " he said			0
" they came from outside			0
" @entity14 's @entity51 , in a posting on the network 's website , said @entity1 arrived for the interview in a small convoy of sedans accompanied by little security			1
" @entity1 said he wanted to speak to the press to get the truth out , and he spent more than an hour with us trying to put forth his side of the story , " @entity51 wrote			2
he questioned how the international community could freeze his assets , impose sanctions and embargo arms sales based on media reports , and invited the @entity67 to carry out an independent " fact - finding mission , " she reported			0
he vowed not to leave @entity2 , she reported , and denied having used force against his people			0
" he seemed to be in complete denial about the protests against him , and that other big cities in @entity2 , particularly those in the east , had been taken by his opponents , " she said			0
" he simply rejected the notion that any walls were closing in on him			0
he denied he was besieged in the capital and said he would survive the current situation			0
" he reiterated an assertion he first made last week that his opponents have been given hallucinogens by @entity44 operatives , and he said he felt betrayed by the @entity11 , which had lifted its sanctions on the country after @entity1 agreed to give up his pursuit of weapons of mass destruction in 2003			1
" i 'm surprised that we have an alliance with the @entity90 to fight @entity44 , and now that we are fighting terrorists they have abandoned us , " he said , according to @entity51			0
" perhaps they want to occupy @entity2			0
" @entity1 called @entity11 president @entity94 a " good man " but said he might have been given " misinformation			1
" " the statements i have heard from him must have come from someone else , " @entity1 said			2
@entity11 ambassador to the @entity67 @entity101 was unimpressed			1
" it sounds , just frankly , delusional , " she told reporters			1
" and when he can laugh in talking to @entity11 and international journalists while he is slaughtering his own people , it only underscores how unfit he is to lead and how disconnected he is from reality			1
" it makes all the more important the urgent steps that we have taken over the course of the last week on a national basis , as well as the steps that we 've taken collectively through the @entity67 and the @entity115 , and we 're going to continue to keep the pressure on			0
" she called on @entity1 " to step aside to prevent further bloodshed and to allow the @entity2 people to have a government that is responsive to their aspirations			2
