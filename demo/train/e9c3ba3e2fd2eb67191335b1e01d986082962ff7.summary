-- last night @entity1 was the 10th star to claim the mirrored ball on " @entity3			2
" the lead @entity4 went up against @entity7 figure skater @entity6 and @entity9 anchor @entity8 and came out victorious			2
many predicted that @entity1 would win from the start based on her spectacular performances and stage presence , not to mention her extensive dance history as a member of the @entity4			1
but @entity6 and @entity8 gave her a good run for her money , bringing an enjoyable end to a season of controversy			2
was it me , or was season 10 the most exciting ever ? @entity29 's diva behavior , @entity24 's cornball glances at @entity25 , and @entity1 's spats with @entity27 made it must - watch tv , not to mention @entity32 's major snafu regarding @entity8 ' wardrobe			1
the show seriously picked the right contestants this time around			1
to help them out for season 11 , here are the 15 stars we 'd love to see do the rumba next			1
the @entity0 : @entity29 and 7 more celebs rejected by @entity42 @entity43 so she might be a bit out of reach , especially since @entity43 is stuck in the @entity47 isolation bubble , but this could be a rebirth for her			1
let 's face it : @entity43 has a lost some of her flair and she lets her daughter do most of the fancy dressing			2
" @entity3 " would allow @entity43 to separate herself from @entity56 , and at least get her out of the house			2
@entity58 and @entity59 the couple has said in interviews that they are interested in joining " @entity3			2
" it would be good for everyone			2
@entity58 could get away from judging those sassy " @entity66 " stylists and rock some tacky , sparkly clothes			2
@entity59 could get back on the radar for something other than being @entity58 's husband			2
and the show could get to play off the drama of having a competing couple			1
the @entity0 : 10 top models without makeup @entity76 @entity76 may be leaving her iconic television show behind , but that does n't mean she ca n't move on to something else			1
she needs to think of all the fans she has been shepherding for so many years ! honestly , with the number of women who look to her for advice on what to eat , read , and wear -- i do n't think there 's any way she could lose			0
@entity90 now that " lost " is over , people are going to have to find their dose of shirtless @entity94 somewhere else			0
we can sit around and watch old " lost " clips , but i think seeing him get sweaty and strip down in a samba would be a better alternative			1
yes ? the @entity0 : 8 things i wo n't miss now that " lost " is off the tv map @entity103 back in 2007 , the @entity105 songstress said that she was interested in doing the show			1
why has n't " @entity107 " snatched her up yet ? they have a pretty loose definition of " star , " and she would be one of their biggest grabs			1
i am picturing a " @entity114 " - themed waltz to " my heart would go on			0
" it would be cheesily epic			0
@entity117 this lady is 2010 's big thing , and rightfully so			0
@entity117 is adorable , feisty , and totally held her own on " @entity121 " this month			0
if @entity117 ends up in a set of dancing shoes , i am officially dubbing her the coolest grandma ever			0
the @entity0 : 10 summer dresses under $ 50 @entity126 so @entity6 gave it his shot and got to the final three , but i think @entity126 could take it all the way			0
throughout the @entity7 , he was known for bringing theatricality and flair to all his performances			0
the dance floor is the only other place that i can think of that could capture @entity126 's signature brand of pizzazz			1
plus , we 'd get the added perks of more self - designed outfits and seeing him get to beat @entity6 at something			0
@entity143 the comedian just had her show on @entity146 canceled , so now it is time to dance the pain away			1
@entity143 strikes us as sort of klutzy , but i am sure that can be smoothed out by the tender footsteps of @entity152 or @entity153			0
@entity143 is sure to make the sometimes exhaustive judging process a little more entertaining			0
@entity155 between " @entity156 " and " @entity157 , " @entity155 seems like quite the family man			0
but i have heard rumors that in real life he has a dirty sense of humor			0
maybe @entity155 could reroute that crudeness into sexy dance moves ? it would be a good mix of amusing and awkward , since a lot of viewers probably could n't see past @entity155 as anyone other than @entity170			1
dr. @entity171 it is time for dr. @entity171 to add something else to his resume other than harassing addicted celebrities and pregnant teens			1
the @entity177 needs to come to the dance floor and switch from psychoanalysis to polka			1
the @entity0 : see 10 stars who 've worn ankle alcohol monitors [ @entity183 ] @entity184 " @entity189 " is finally starting to see a decline , while " @entity3 " just had one of its most successful seasons			1
now i have n't taken math since high school but it seems like it is time for @entity184 to think about switching teams			1
a little bit of fancy footwork could be just what he needs , though they would have to make it clear he could n't host the show			1
@entity204 @entity205 herself has said she wants to be on the show because her kids love to watch her dance			1
now that she is stuck in the middle of a bribery controversy , she could use " @entity212 " for image revitalization			0
though there is a chance not even " @entity3 " could save her from this royal mess			0
@entity217 speaking of image revitalization , @entity217 could use a little help right now			0
her sex tape has just hit the market , and with a rumored second one on the way , @entity217 needs to get people 's minds off these tapes and onto something else			0
and she already proved on her former reality show " @entity228 " that she definitely can " shake her booty			2
" the @entity0 : pro tennis player 's breast reduction deflates her fan base mr. t mr. @entity235 had a brief fling as a rapper , and now it is time for him to reach triple threat territory			1
i pity the fool who do n't vote for him			0
with the movie remake of " a-team " out soon , he needs to make sure viewers know who the real @entity245 is			0

it seems like it is time for @entity184 to think about switching to " @entity107 "
@entity204 said she wants to do the show because her kids love to watch her dance
mr. @entity235 had a fling as a rapper , and now it is time for him to reach triple threat territory
