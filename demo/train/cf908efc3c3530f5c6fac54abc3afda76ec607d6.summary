-- the best summer movie ever made premiered 50 years ago this weekend			1
it had no sharks , robots , zombies , superheroes or alien invaders			0
nobody met somebody else in cute " rom - com " fashion and no one traveled in time			0
though explosive in its way , there were no explosions ; indeed , no special effects of any kind			0
there was n't even much of a story ; at least not the kind with a beginning , middle or end			2
so what was it about ? not much , really			0
just four guys in suits running , jumping , meandering and goofing around all day from one crowded area to another in search of breathing room , all filmed in stunning black and white			0
" @entity46 , " the 1964 musical comedy that brought the @entity34 -- and the global phenomenon they detonated -- to the big screen , marks its half - century with a new dvd - @entity39 package from the @entity40 , whose digitally restored version ( from the original negative ) is being theatrically released in more than 50 @entity45 cities this weekend			1
10 places to relive @entity48 even with all the brighter , bolder , fresher - looking @entity51 product out there over this holiday , i do n't think it 's a stretch to say that none of them will be a better experience than " @entity46 , " especially if you 've never seen it before			1
but it holds true even if you 've already seen it once , twice or too many times to count			0
in the end , that 's what a great summer movie is supposed to do : make you want to go back on the ride again to experience the same thrills and , maybe , find something new to like about it			1
not too many movies do that anymore			0
i do n't just mean there are fewer movies -- such as " @entity46 " -- shot in black and white , or ones that dare to tell stories in the same off - the - cuff narrative line			1
but you 're less likely to find one now that takes chances with its material , veers into storytelling anarchy and @entity83			1
opinion : why @entity34 could n't happen in today 's digital age " @entity46 " not only knew how to let go , it made its audiences do it , too			1
in his liner notes to the new @entity40 disc , critic - historian @entity89 uses the expression " euphoric blur " to characterize the movie and the way it was made			2
director @entity96 , whose experience up till that point included tv sketch comedies for such antic @entity101 comics as @entity102 and @entity103 , applied such a loose , intimate and baggy texture to this mythical day - in - the - life - of - the - @entity34 that those who first beheld it believed it to be almost a documentary			1
it was n't , except for some of the answers @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 deliver in the press - conference set piece			2
by the time the movie was filmed in the spring of 1964 , they 'd answered those kinds of questions hundreds of times on two continents			2
( interviewer : " how did you find @entity45 ? " @entity127 : " turned left at @entity125			2
" ) summer rewind : looking back at 1964 that was the other liberating , intoxicating aspect of " @entity46 " -- its attitude			1
it refused to take anything , not even its subjects ' galvanic success , seriously			0
when rock - and - rollers such as @entity137 did movies , they seemed so awkwardly sincere that you wondered if they 'd misplaced the energy that made them famous in the first place			0
under @entity96 's " guidance , " the @entity34 showed the same brash insouciance in on - screen that they displayed in performance			1
( @entity113 snorting through an empty @entity148 bottle , @entity116 deadpanning under a hair dryer while reading a magazine as the manager , @entity153 fumes , " what are you up to ? " says @entity156			0
" ) all this sent me to the moon and back when i was 11 , and i was allowed to see " @entity46 " during its opening weekend in @entity45			1
this would have been early august , a month after the movie 's july 6 @entity163 premiere			2
it was a saturday evening , and my parents , along with others , black and white alike , in the @entity168 housing project where i grew up , actually agreed to drive a bunch of their kids to a downtown movie house , to see , unaccompanied , what the shouting was about			2
how @entity176 met @entity34 at that point , i was n't as committed to the @entity34 as my sister and her friends were even before the movie started			1
but after it was over , all of us were so wired by what we 'd seen that we wanted to run , goof and joke around all night long , even after two cars scooped us up to take us home			0
it was as if the movie -- and the @entity34 themselves -- had given me permission to be as wise , foolish , daring , smart and alert to the world as i wanted to be			1
and i could n't wait to see it again just to make sure i had n't imagined it			2
it would be years before i had that chance			0
when i did , i felt just as empowered and exhilarated by that movie in my 20s as i did on that long - ago twilight			1
when my own son saw it for the first time , at age 6 , he was just as hyped as i 'd been			0
the gift that " @entity46 " keeps giving is the right of all who see it to say to themselves , " take the world as it comes and when you break from its moorings , do n't be afraid to be as silly or as soulful as you 're able			1
and whatever you do , make sure you bring other people along			0
" maybe i 'm still dreaming all this			0
but i 'm awake enough to know one thing : no new movie that came out this year can make so many audiences feel as buoyant or as alive as this movie did -- and does			0
it 's possible that both " @entity221 " and , for that matter , the @entity34 themselves were miracles that could never be duplicated			1
but ca n't the movies at least try to imagine that such things are possible ?			0

@entity226 : best summer movie ? " @entity46 , " 50 years ago this weekend
