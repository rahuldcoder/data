-- there 's a lot to be said for determination			2
two years ago , a contraption that looked a bit like a bouncy ball attached to a clothesline , took flight in a pioneering experiment in the @entity11 countryside			2
a @entity13 clip of a man flying the electric " @entity15 " attracted over 8 million hits , with comments ranging from : " amazing machine ! " to " not sure you could pay me enough to sit in the middle of flying blenders bolted together			1
" regardless , the three @entity11 engineers behind the baffling creation plowed ahead with their dream of making an electric helicopter			1
last week it paid off			0
there was n't a bouncy ball in sight as the slick white " @entity34 " took to the air for the first time , quietly hovering 20 meters high , while its ecstatic creators cheered below			1
featuring 18 propellers on a lightweight carbon frame , the futuristic copter -- which has been around € 4 million ( $ 5.4 million ) in the making -- could change the way we commute forever			2
" what we 're looking at now , is in the future where everyone is traveling not by car , but by some kind of aircraft , " explained @entity45 , co-chief executive of e-volo , the company behind the remarkable flying machine			1
" normal helicopters are very hard to fly			0
but we thought ' what if you could have a helicopter that is easy for the pilot to fly , and cheap compared to other aircraft ? ' " clever copter powered by a 100 kilogram battery , the two - passenger @entity34 can travel at least 70 kilometers per hour , recently making its first remote - controlled flight in a hanger in @entity61 , southwest @entity11			1
the chopper weighs just 300 kilograms in total			0
one limitation is that it currently only has enough power to fly for 20 minutes -- though designers are looking at ways of increasing this , or introducing a hybrid engine			2
many small rotors -- attached to a 10 - meter wide circular frame -- also help the eco-friendly machine hover more easily than other helicopters			1
" if you let the joystick go , the @entity34 will just hover in the current position , so there 's nothing the pilot has to do , " said @entity45			1
" but if you do that in another helicopter it will crash immediately			2
" reimagining the city indeed , the @entity34 's simplicity sets it apart from other helicopters , and its creators hope in the future commuters will be able to take their electric aircraft to work , instead of languishing in gridlocked cars below			1
the @entity91 is already looking at ways personal aerial vehicles ( @entity94 ) could revolutionize urban spaces			1
it might sound like a scene from the @entity98 , but a city where flying machines replace cars is n't as far off as it seems			1
" the most helicopters in the world are in @entity103 , @entity104 , " explained @entity45			0
" they have several thousand movements per day because the streets are congested and everyone who can afford it is taking the helicopter to go from one building to the next			0
" you can imagine this happening in a big city in @entity11			0
and already we 've been approached by several companies who 'd like to do it , maybe with landing pads on buildings			0
" the team hopes to sell its first @entity34 by 2015 , with each machine setting you back € 250,000 ( $ 338,000 )			1
they 're now on the lookout for further funding to develop their unique design			0
think big it 's a long way from the first awkward - looking @entity15 test flight in 2011			1
even more impressive , considering @entity45 himself was a computer software engineer for 25 years before turning his attention to futuristic flying machines -- " i was dreaming of building a helicopter since i was a child , " he said			0
then there 's the other e-volo founders -- @entity137 , a former physicist , and @entity139 , who managed a disco for almost 10 years , who also got on board the pioneering project			2
" i think everyone wants to fly , " said @entity45			0
" helicopters are very expensive and people think maybe this is a way to be a pilot themselves			0
" in 20 or 30 years from now there will be even more cities with millions more people living in them and transportation will be a big problem			0
maybe you need to go up in the air to solve these problems			0

introducing e-volo 's @entity34 : *multi-rotor* electric helicopter makes maiden flight
eco-friendly machine powered by 100 kg battery , can travel 70kph
part of @entity91 *scheme* looking at how personal aerial vehicles could replace cars
expected to be available by 2015 , would cost around $ 338,000
