-- @entity2 's personal tale of two cities began with a serious case of the travel bug			1
born in @entity6 , he started flying to @entity7 with his family as a child -- the frequent trans - @entity11 trips made possible in part by his mother 's job at the now - defunct airline @entity16			1
" i think i grew up with an obsession with the city , " @entity2 said , vowing to one day move to the @entity18			1
the graphic designer finally came to live in @entity7 for three months in fall 2010 and found himself doing lots of people watching , sketching and thinking of home			1
" the idea of comparing the differences between the two cities came because i was starting to miss @entity6 , " @entity2 said			1
" i was trying to understand why and what actually was missing from each city that was in the other city			2
" the result is " @entity6 versus @entity7 : a @entity31 , " a whimsical little book of illustrations that first gained a following on @entity2 's blog and that pair everything from a croque - monsieur and a hot dog to cancan and @entity38			1
the artist , who now spends time in both cities and calls the illustrations a friendly visual match between the two , recently spoke with @entity0 from his home in @entity6			1
the following is an edited version of that interview			2
@entity0 : what was your first impression of @entity7 ? @entity2 : the first thing i remember from the @entity53 and @entity7 is the amount of snow , because i was there during wintertime			1
we do n't have that here -- we do n't have 1 meter of snow in the city , we have 1 meter in the @entity62 when you go skiing			0
it always melts right away in @entity6			1
i came back alone when i was 17 to celebrate the end of high school ; i got the trip as a gift to go in the summertime			0
what struck me was @entity7 's perspective : you are on the street and you ca n't see the end and it 's just striking when you see the amount of buildings			1
another strong memory : i used to have my own way of orienting myself in the city because i could n't understand how it worked -- the avenues and the streets			0
i always got my bearings from the @entity87 and when i came back in 2003 after 9/11 , it was n't there anymore , of course , and i was really lost			0
@entity0 : a lot of people are overwhelmed by @entity7			2
did you ever feel that way ? @entity2 : no , i feel really like i 'm at home			2
i 'm not overwhelmed by the urban jungle			0
@entity0 : what do you miss about each city when you 're in the other metropolis ? @entity2 : in @entity7 , i used to miss my bike			1
but now i can even have a bike there , so it 's becoming more @entity103 than ever			0
i used to miss baguette bread and now it 's ok			0
i can find something much closer to @entity6 baguettes			2
and there 's a big variety of bread there , so i do n't care			0
in @entity6 , i miss the way people can talk to each other just for even five minutes in the street like in @entity7			1
it 's something that is missing in @entity6 , in a way			2
five lessons learned from living in @entity6 @entity0 : both cities have a reputation , deserved or not , that its residents are rude			1
what 's your take on that ? @entity2 : it 's a superficial way of looking at the cities when you are there for four or five days			1
when you get to know the people better , you find they are absolutely exquisite			0
but you have to be patient -- more patient in @entity6			2
many people have that first reaction in the tourist places			0
i think it 's because they 're overcrowded and the waiters are n't patient any more			0
the best way is to move away a bit and to have a distance from that			0
@entity0 : both cities are known for fashion			2
what are your observations on that ? @entity2 : in @entity6 , it 's much more minimal and when you are wearing something ( unusual ) people are like , who do you think you are ? in @entity7 , people give you compliments about it			1
i see ladies who keep looking at each other and they 're not looking ( to spot something ) wrong , they 're complimenting each other -- oh , i love your dress			0
it 's something that 's not often the case in @entity6			2
the joys of slowly savoring @entity6 @entity0 : what 's your favorite illustration in the book ? @entity2 : @entity169 - @entity168			1
( image no. 6 in the gallery			0
) i love airports because you are not gone , you are not home , you are in between			0
that illustration is all about traveling and not knowing where a plane is going when you 're looking at its trail in the sky			0
@entity0 : what 's your favorite meal in @entity6 ? @entity2 : i love everything from a brasserie			1
good brasserie food would include steak tartare , boeuf bourguignonne , bouillabaisse			0
@entity0 : what 's your favorite meal in @entity7 ? @entity2 : burgers			1
it 's really very @entity194 © , but i ca n't help it .			0
