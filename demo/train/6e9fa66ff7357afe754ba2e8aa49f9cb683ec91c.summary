@entity2 is launching its first lunar probe in early december , state - run @entity1 news agency reported tuesday , just over a decade after the country first sent an astronaut into space			1
the @entity8 probe -- which will blast off from a @entity10 rocket in @entity12 province located in southwest @entity2 -- is expected to land on the moon 's surface in mid-december , a spokesman for the @entity2 's @entity16 told @entity1			1
the unmanned mission marks @entity2 's first attempt at a soft - landing on the lunar surface and the first soft - landing on the moon since the @entity23 @entity22 probe in 1976			2
@entity2 sets course for lunar landing this year on landing , the spacecraft will release @entity28 ( called @entity28 in @entity2 ) -- a six - wheeled lunar rover equipped with four cameras and two mechanical legs that can dig up soil samples , a designer for the rover told @entity1 earlier this month			0
a public poll determined the the solar - powered robot 's name , which comes from the white pet rabbit of the @entity2 moon godess chang'e			1
the slow - moving rover will patrol the moon 's surface for at least three months , according to @entity1			2
timeline : @entity2 's race into space @entity2 is yet to announce the probe 's preferred landing site , but researchers say an impact crater named @entity49 , or @entity49 , is its likely destination			0
in 2010 , @entity2 's previous lunar mission captured images of the crater while scouting potential landing sites for the 2013 probe			0
in the @entity57 , scientists are concerned the @entity2 mission could interfere with a @entity60 study of the moon 's dust environment			1
@entity8 's descent is likely to create a noticeable plume on the moon 's surface that could skew the results of research already being carried out by @entity60 's @entity68 ( @entity68 ) , @entity69 , chair of @entity60 's @entity71 told @entity72 , a space news site			2
the mission constitutes the second phase of @entity2 's moon exploration program which includes orbiting , landing and returning to @entity78			0
earlier missions included plotting a high - resolution , full - coverage lunar map .			0
