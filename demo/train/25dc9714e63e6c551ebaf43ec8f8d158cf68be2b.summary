-- the @entity1 is about to get a lot bigger			0
the hall 's selection committee on saturday -- meeting in @entity6 , on the eve of @entity8 -- selected six former players and one coach to join the ranks of the @entity12 's best			0
they were all bigger than life , literally and figuratively , in their heydays -- from towering , 6 - foot - 9 inch @entity14 offensive tackle @entity18 to the " @entity19 , " the moniker given to legendary and well - traveled coach @entity19			1
speechless , " @entity18 said , on his @entity23 page , moments after the announcement			1
" still ca n't believe it			0
" the original @entity28 -- as the team 's first draft pick after it relocated from @entity32 to @entity14 -- literally stands above everyone else in the class of 2013 , by virtue of his height and 345 - pound frame			1
on the field , the @entity39 grad stood out enough to be named @entity41 six times and earn @entity44 honors in 11 of his 12 seasons			0
another big name , and big personality , who will be joining him is @entity50			1
the @entity52 product terrorized linemen and quarterbacks while racking up 96.5 sacks over his 13 - year career with the @entity58 and the @entity59 , although some better know him for his brash trash - talking , wide smile and love for the camera , including on the 2008 season of " @entity65			2
" " @entity50 played the game with incredible ability and passion , " @entity59 co-chairman @entity66 said of the 1999 @entity68 and @entity69 champ			2
" he ... helped to redefine the tackle position			0
" two other defensive stars will be joining @entity50 in the @entity1 in @entity75 , @entity76			2
one is another defensive tackle , @entity78 , who made six @entity44 during his 14 seasons between 1968 and 1981 with the @entity80 , @entity82 and @entity81			2
going farther back in @entity12 history is linebacker @entity84 , who amassed 27 interceptions in his career , much of it with @entity90 's great @entity89 teams			1
after narrowly missing out in recent years , wide receiver @entity91 finally will make the trip to @entity75 -- just 120 miles from where he first emerged at @entity94			2
in his 16 @entity12 campaigns , most of them with the @entity97 , he was consistently among the league 's top wideouts with eight straight seasons with over 1,000 receiving yards and 130 total touchdowns			0
his selection stirred rejoicing among @entity97 ' fans , with team owner @entity106 calling the current @entity108 analyst " one of the most beloved players in franchise history			0
" " in terms of catching the football , i have n't seen anybody in my time better than @entity91 , " former @entity97 assistant and @entity113 head coach @entity111 said , according to the @entity97 ' official website			1
just over five years ago , @entity119 was a dominating presence with the @entity121 , with whom he played after 12 seasons with the @entity124			1
now the mammoth offensive lineman -- measuring in at 6 feet , 3 inches and 325 pounds -- has another honor to his name as a hall of famer , in addition to having been named to the @entity12 's all - decade teams for the 1990s and 2000s			2
" @entity119 is one of the greatest players in @entity124 history , and arguably the very best guard to ever play the game , " said @entity124 owner @entity131 , whom @entity119 has tapped to give his induction speech			1
@entity19 is this year 's other honoree , a man who never played in the @entity12 though he nonetheless became one of the league 's most recognizable names in the 1980s , 1990s and 2000s			1
a graduate of @entity141 , he was drafted in the seventh round by the @entity81 but opted for a carer in coaching			0
he took stints at several universities before jumping to the @entity12			0
@entity19 led the @entity147 to two @entity149 titles , then took the @entity150 to the title game in january 1997 ( where they lost ) , before finishing up his career with stops with the @entity156 , @entity124 and @entity157			1
" @entity19 has been thought of as one of the all - time greats for a long time , so it is with great pride that we can officially refer to him as a @entity165 , " said @entity150 head coach @entity158 , who coached under @entity19 with the @entity147 and @entity156 before succeeding him in @entity150			1
" he deserves all the recognition he is getting			0
" the seven inductees were chosen saturday by the @entity1 's selection committee from a list of 17 finalists -- with late longtime @entity171 and @entity14 owner @entity172 , @entity173 running back @entity175 and wide receiver @entity176 among those narrowly missing the cut			1
the honorees will be enshrined on august 3 , in a ceremony expected to include 130 others who have been so honored over the past 50 years			0
already blown away by his name being called , @entity18 said he expects the feeling will only get better when he gets to @entity76 , according to a story on the @entity14 ' official website			0
" it will be one of the best moments of my life , " he said .			0
