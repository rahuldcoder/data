@entity0 -- some families of 9/11 victims say they are confused , anxious and surprised as the 10th anniversary approaches because they have not received invitations to the sunday ceremony opening the ground zero memorial			1
@entity8 , who lost her husband @entity9 in the terrorist attack on the @entity11 , said she is thinking of canceling her plans to attend the memorial because the whole thing seems so disorganized			0
" there was no notification			0
i made reservations not knowing what the final plans were			0
i still have n't received an official invitation , " @entity20 said			0
she added that the last thing she wants for herself and her 12 - year - old son is have to deal with a large crowd and make a " hard day even harder			1
" @entity20 said she has made several calls to the @entity0 mayor 's office about her missing invitation without hearing back			1
so did @entity31 , who said the mayor 's office finally told her after several days of calling that she would be receiving the invitation last week but she still has not received it			1
it 's been 10 days since she spoke to the mayor 's office , and she is anxious to make sure she and her relatives can attend the memorial to honor her daughter , @entity41			1
and a widow who did not wish to be identified told @entity1 while she did not receive an official invitation , she assumed there would be some kind of memorial			2
" we made plans knowing that something was going to happen			0
my friend will take us with her			0
she got two invitations , i got none , " she said			2
the woman still feels she should have gotten her own invitation , especially since she says she has never had any problems receiving memorial notifications in the past			0
" i 'm appalled , surprised , and irritated			0
this just makes things more difficult , " the widow said			0
the confusion and anxieties surround official invitations -- or lack of them -- for the sunday morning service that will mark the opening of the @entity68 at ground zero			1
the ceremony starting at 8:30 a.m. will include the reading of the names of victims and two moments of silence to mark the times the towers were hit			1
family members will be allowed in the memorial , where they will see for the first time their loved ones ' names inscribed in bronze			2
meanwhile , @entity0 mayor @entity84 's office said in a statement on sunday : " we communicate regularly with the family members and have recently sent out letters and e-mails about this year 's ceremony			1
family members have direct access to our staff for any questions that arise , and we 'll have staff on site that day to resolve any issues			1
so while we apologize for any confusion , there is no reason for any family member to be concerned about not being able to attend the ceremony			1
" @entity102 is the president and ceo of the @entity68			1
he said he has reached out to victims ' families , letting them know that if they have not yet received an official invitation , they will be able to use alternate methods to identify themselves for admission to the ceremony			1
" i want to assure you that nothing has changed from years past in terms of access to the ceremony , " @entity102 said			2
that offers little consolation to family members who want a real invitation that will guarantee them entry			2
@entity120 worries that trying to get into the ceremony with other identification methods will complicate getting in , and that will add more stress and anxiety			2
" i want the official invitation to cut down on the hassle the day of the memorial			2
i do n't feel totally comfortable that this is going to work , " she said			0
@entity131 , whose husband died on 9/11 , is traveling and said she wo n't be back home to get her invitation until after september 11 , if in fact it arrives			2
she has been relying on a website for the 9/11 community of families -- voices of september 11th -- for information			1
she plans to bring her husband 's death certificate to gain entry to the memorial			0
@entity131 said she is planning on taking part in all of the memorials for her husband and the other victims , and has invitations to all events -- except the ground zero memorial ceremony sunday morning			1
not everyone has had a problem receiving an invitation , though			0
@entity156 , whose son @entity157 died on 9/11 , received her cardboard invitation in the mail two weeks ago			0
she thinks the whole issue of invitations is getting blown out of proportion and is confident that " if you 're a family member , they 're going to let you in			1
" @entity165 , who lost a son , was anxious until her invitation arrived in the mail last thursday			0
she plans to bring other relatives and she received a notice telling her that she was permitted to bring guests			0
@entity172 from the @entity173 , who lost a relative on 9/11 , received his invitation in plenty of time to plan a visit and he said he wonders if some people just were n't in the correct database .			0
