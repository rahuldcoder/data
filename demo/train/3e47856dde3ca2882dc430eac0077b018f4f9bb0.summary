@entity0 -- after his father 's death , a young prince , driven by suspicion , kills his uncle in a web of political intrigue			0
sound familiar ? the classic @entity9 drama " @entity8 " is scheduled for a performance in @entity11 in september 2015 by the @entity12 as part of a two - year tour to perform in every country			1
the parallels of staging a drama about an epic family power struggle in @entity19 , where the country 's young leader @entity20 had his uncle , @entity22 executed has raised a few eyebrows -- especially from human rights groups			1
@entity22 was considered instrumental in @entity20 's rise to power , but @entity20 turned his back on his uncle in spectacular fashion late last year as @entity22 was branded " a traitor for all ages " and executed on charges that he had attempted to overthrow the government			2
human rights criticism " if the @entity12 goes to @entity11 , they should read up on the reality of the country before they get there , " said @entity35 , a spokesperson for @entity36			1
@entity11 's human rights record came under heavy scrutiny last month in a 400 - page @entity42 @entity44 report that called the country 's stunning catalog of torture and abuse as lacking " any parallel in the contemporary world			1
" " no tragic play could come close to the misery that the 100,000 people trapped in the country 's prison camps endure -- where torture , rape , starvation and execution are everyday occurrences , " @entity35 said			2
the @entity12 defended its decision to visit the country saying that " a policy of inclusion , rather than exclusion , is more true to the spirit of @entity68			1
" called a @entity12 to @entity71 tour , the group intends to travel to all seven continents -- irrespective of political situations			1
the troupe also plans to visit @entity75 , @entity76 , the @entity77 and @entity78 in " its most ambitious tour yet			0
" @entity68 a " force for good " " we have always believed that cultural communication , and different peoples talking to each other through art , is a force for good in the world			0
in every country , we are going for one single and simple purpose : to play @entity8 there , " a statement released by the @entity90 - based theater said			1
its " @entity8 " production is described as a " fresh , pared - down version " that lasts two hours and 40 minutes , with 12 actors and four stage managers using a portable stage			2
the theater stated that " @entity8 " was first written when @entity100 was weathering internal tensions , repression and violence			0
" like all the best works of art , ' @entity8 ' instigates discussion and dialogue , and like any theatre , we wish to play to , and interact with , as many people as we possibly can , in as diverse a range of locations as possible			0
we do not believe that anyone should be excluded from the chance to experience this play , " according to its statement			0
the theater group is not the first to get blasted by human rights groups for performing in @entity11			0
@entity119 , former @entity120 player , came under blistering criticism for holding a basketball exhibition and singing " @entity123 " to @entity20			0
in 2008 , the @entity124 held a controversial concert in @entity19 , which was aired on @entity11 's state - run tv and radio			1
the lessons of " @entity8 " may not extend to the young @entity11 leader , said @entity36 's spokesperson			1
" there 's a dark irony in the fact that @entity8 focuses on a prince wrestling with his conscience , " @entity35 said			2
" @entity20 is no @entity8			0
sadly he shows no sign of wrestling with his conscience			0

@entity12 plans a two - year tour of " @entity8 " to every country in the world
plans to perform in @entity11 draws criticism from @entity36
