@entity0 -- the rash of stories about priestly sexual abuse in @entity5 , especially in @entity6 and @entity7 , has put many @entity8 on the defensive			1
while sexual molestation of any kind is always indefensible , the politics surrounding this story is also indefensible			2
employers from every walk of life , in both the @entity17 and @entity5 , have long handled cases of alleged sex abuse by employees as an internal matter			1
rarely have employers called the cops , and none was required to do so			2
though this is starting to change , any discussion of employee sexual abuse that took place 30 and 40 years ago must acknowledge this reality			2
thus it hardly comes as a surprise that cardinal @entity32 in @entity6 did not summon the authorities about a case involving a priest in the 1970s			2
what is surprising is why some are now indicting him , acting as if his response was the exception to the rule			2
selective indignation at the @entity8 is not confined to @entity32			1
why , for example , are the psychologists and psychiatrists who pledged to " fix " abusers treated so lightly ? after all , employers from the corporate world to the @entity8 were told over and over again that therapy works and to give the offender a second chance			1
indeed , the zeitgeist of the day was that rehabilitation not only works , it is virtuous			0
that such advice was wildly oversold can now be agreed upon by almost everyone , and that is precisely why it smacks of politics to deny how strongly held the rehabilitative ideal was			0
had the @entity8 simply tossed the offenders out , it would have been branded as heartless			1
there is also much noise about cardinal @entity64 -- now the pope -- approving the transfer of a priest out of his archdiocese in @entity7 for therapy			0
that happened 30 years ago			0
again , he did exactly what virtually every other leader , clerical or secular , did			0
anyone who maintains that in @entity75 or @entity5 it was common practice for employers outside the @entity8 to file a police report about suspected wrongdoing by their employees needs to put up or shut up : where is the evidence ? beyond that issue , the focus on sexual abuse in the @entity8 is far out of proportion to the attention given by the media to the sexual molestation of minors when committed by @entity93 clergymen			1
according to a report by the @entity98 in october , the @entity96 district attorney 's office had filed charges in 26 cases of sexual abuse involving members of the @entity104 jewish community			1
just this month , rabbi @entity105 was found guilty on eight counts of sexually abusing a @entity96 boy			0
yet the @entity98 , which has run several stories on the decades - old cases in @entity6 and @entity7 , never reported it			2
and none of it merits the kind of attention given to priests			0
public school teachers accused of sex abuse are either transferred to another school district -- it 's so common that it is called " passing the trash " -- or they are assigned to what , in @entity0 , they call a " rubber room " ( these are places where teachers draw full salary and benefits doing makeshift administrative work )			1
both the teachers unions and state law allow this outrage to continue			0
maybe if the media concentrated on this problem , solutions would follow			0
but the politics of the day being what they are , do n't bet on it			0
it 's a lot sexier to nail the @entity8			1
the hyper - concentration on the @entity8 is not by accident			1
the @entity8 preaches an ethic of sexual restraint -- a profoundly countercultural idea -- so when a priest fails , it 's tempting to highlight it			1
human nature being what it is , that 's understandable			0
but it 's also immoral			0
quite frankly , if sexual abuse is wrong , it should not matter what the identity of the abuser is			1
selective justice is the highest form of injustice			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity163 .			2

@entity163 says *church* treated sex abuse as internal matter , as did other leaders
he says *critics* are *unfairly* implying @entity8 acted *differently* in failing to *disclose* such cases
he says other faiths , *professions* have had *similar* problems but less publicity
