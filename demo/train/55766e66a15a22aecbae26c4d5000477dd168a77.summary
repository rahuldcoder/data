@entity0 , @entity1 -- the volcanic eruption in @entity4 has given scientists a unique opportunity to study its effect on marine biology			1
an international team of scientists is in the far @entity11 testing whether volcanic eruptions have a side effect of increasing the absorption of carbon dioxide into the deep sea			1
the expedition , from the @entity19 's @entity18 in @entity20 , was planned several years before the eruption of the volcano @entity23			2
by chance , it has now given the scientists the opportunity to see how volcanic ash effects iron levels in the water and in turn the growth of the vital organism phytoplankton			1
phytoplankton is important to the eco-system because it takes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into the deep sea when it dies			1
growth of phytoplankton in certain areas is usually limited by lack of iron in the water , and the sub polar @entity11 is believed to be one of these areas			1
phytoplankton usually blooms in the spring , but dies back in the summer			1
however , scientists are testing the theory that the volcanic eruption has increased iron in the water and will prolong the spring blooms into summer			1
professor @entity52 , who is leading the team of 22 scientists , told @entity2 from on board the ship @entity56 : " we are extremely lucky that the volcano has given us a fantastic natural experiment			2
" normally iron is so low here that after a massive spring bloom , it does n't grow well in the summer			0
but after the volcano there 's been a lot more iron falling in to the ocean , so we have a fantastic opportunity to check whether iron makes the bloom last longer			2
" we are seeing enhanced iron levels compared with other years and we think that 's because of the volcano			0
we need to do a lot more analysis back at the lab before we can confirm the volcano has caused extra phytoplankton growth			2
" the five - week cruise set off on july 4 and is now in the sub-polar region of the @entity11 between @entity81 and @entity4			1
it follows an earlier expedition in april and may , which by chance coincided with the eruption of @entity23			2
prof. @entity52 said : " the volcano erupted during the previous trip to check how conditions were for the spring bloom			0
they sailed right into the plume , which was an amazing experience though not particularly healthy			0
" they went right up to the coast of @entity4 and the ship was covered with ash			2
there was a real rise in iron levels then			0
" despite the unique research opportunity offered by the volcano , which is now dormant , it has forced the scientist to abandon the initial aim of their expedition to test the normal iron levels in the region			1
" it upset our original hypothesis that this region is iron limited , " said prof. @entity52			0
" but we now have a great opportunity to see if a massive volcano can cause enhanced phytoplankton growth and sink more carbon dioxide into the oceans			1
" it 's a unique situation because we have never been able to look at this before			0
this could potentially teach us a lot about how the oceans work			0
the oceans take up 40 percent of all carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , so they are pretty significant			1
" the far @entity11 is globally significant because it acts as a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide			1
the @entity56 has reached 63 ° n , close to @entity81 's ice sheets , where there is only two hours of darkness each night			0
scientists have to work through the night to collect biological samples during the brief hours of darkness when the phytoplankton is not photosynthesizing			2
prof. @entity52 said : " we sailed out of the @entity136 straight into a @entity138 storm which was pretty horrendous			0
we had to take one scientist back with terrible seasickness , which left him dehydrated and needing hospital treatment			0
" it 's absolutely beautiful here now though			0
we 're seeing a lot of whales and other wildlife			0

scientists test if volcanic ash has prolonged phytoplankton blooms
sub-polar @entity11 is vital in *absorbing* carbon dioxide
volcanic eruption gave unique opportunity for research
