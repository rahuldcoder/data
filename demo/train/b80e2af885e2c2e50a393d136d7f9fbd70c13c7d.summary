@entity0 -- the @entity2 is using cutting - edge data gathering technology to help keep the peace in some areas and keep violence from flaring in others , saving both physical and fiscal costs of conflict			1
" we are about breaking and interrupting , stopping and preventing atrocities and destabilizing violence , for the good of the people in the countries where we work , as well as the good of the @entity24 people , " said @entity10 , deputy assistant secretary for partnerships and learning in state 's newly formed @entity14 ( @entity13 ) office			2
@entity10 , a @entity25 laureate , encountered first - hand consequences of miscalculated foreign policy decisions , violence , and instability , when he lost a leg to a land mine during a hike in @entity32 in 1984			0
that led him to co-found @entity34 , which is the first international network of survivors helping survivors to recover from war , rebuild their communities , and break cycles of violence			0
@entity13 analyzes " large data sets " as well as " civil society " generated data -- essentially the sum of patterns , human behaviors , electronic signals , social media elements and everything tangible that creates masses of technological and non-technological data			1
" as observers of patterns , data , and focal points , we look at violence as an epidemic that can ultimately spread , " @entity10 said			2
" as interrupters of violence , by using the nuances such as data analytics we now have the technology to prevent , interrupt and break these cycles of violence			1
" @entity63 and @entity64 @entity2 officials said they did n't want to speculate the " should have , could have , would haves , " but @entity66 , a political - scientist and co-creator of " @entity68 " , a " large data " predictive analysis tool , says otherwise			1
in conjunction with the @entity72 , @entity66 ran a forecast using big data analytics during the run - up to the war in @entity63 , which was a fairly accurate preview of where the conflict would go			1
@entity66 's model anticipated what the @entity63 and international political support would look like if the @entity24 went into @entity63 with and without the @entity83 support			1
it found very early on that if the @entity24 entered @entity63 on its own , " it would be the ultimate source of @entity63 sectarian and domestic violence			1
" it also predicted " the situation in @entity63 would worsen throughout 2003 and 2004 in terms of @entity63 attitudes toward the @entity24 presence as well as insurgent activity , " said @entity66 , whose @entity68 model is now used by @entity10 and his team at @entity13			1
the model produced very specific predictions about the behavior of factions and accurately predicted the timing of defections as well as the potential support from unexpected allies -- such as the specific behavior of @entity107 leaders after @entity109 's regime collapsed â € ” to the point of even accurate sequencing of defections among different factions			2
" when we published our findings with @entity72 , everyone was asking how we did this -- questioning whether or not we had inside deals			0
and we simply responded by saying we only looked at patterns , behaviors , and ran data -- yet everyone was shocked , " @entity66 recalled			2
an alternative to ' top - down ' approach both @entity10 and @entity66 believe that this " large data analytic technology " provides a " focal point " and identifies the players in what @entity66 calls a political " tug of war			1
" software allows analysts to map " different people , players , stakeholders , and people with interests , in various targeted political landscapes			0
" then the computer chip tracks interactions among these elements -- @entity66 's " tug of war " -- and therefore " anticipates if people are going to agree , and if so , what are the compromises , and if not , what are the potential outcomes			0
" the technology allows @entity24 policymakers to frame responses in a timely manner and avoid conflicts that might require the introduction of military forces , reducing the cost in both money and casualties by identifying innovative courses of action that may have not been spotted without the use of this new technology			0
@entity10 suggests the data - driven approach is somewhat contrary to the conventional " top - down " wisdom , since " many believe that it take decades to get into conflicts and consequently it would take the same amount to come out			1
" @entity167 , a senior analyst at @entity13 and former student of @entity66 , suggests " mixing new technologies with conventional methods of developing policy strategies , creates " pockets of hope that allow advanced planning around the patterns of violence for the future			0
" @entity178 , cyber strategist and former policy adviser at the @entity180 and the @entity181 , believes that people 's emotions are a pivotal element in data analysis and capturing these human elements are a huge challenge			0
" if you could apply human judgments , it 's wonderful , otherwise substituting human judgment and talent with computing analytics does not work , " @entity178 said			0
@entity178 's argument is central to what @entity10 and @entity167 regard as pivotal element in their work at the @entity13			0
" the key to success is to combine this nuance and technology with the invaluable talent , knowledge and human power of our diplomats and civilian responders through a comprehensive team effort , " @entity167 said			0
decoding @entity210 one of the main areas of focus for the year - old agency is @entity210 , which is similar to many less - developed countries that lack cyber data availability			1
@entity216 , a former chief of staff of customs and border protection at the @entity24 @entity219 , said " you want data to allow you to see " life 's normal patterns			2
" so this model can work as effective both in developed countries as well as undeveloped countries , " said @entity216 , who is now president of @entity224 , a consulting firm that provides big data analytics for national and homeland security interests			1
@entity216 suggests useful data in less developed countries can be found in " economic data -- what people are buying in stores , what cars are they driving , what kind of phones are they using , refugee flows , the direction of their move , mobile use			0
" both @entity216 and @entity10 believe traditional data and civil society patterns can be as valuable for data analytic forecasts as cyber data that 's more prevalent in developed countries			0
" in the case of @entity210 , we look at trends , where the business leaders gather , what they talk about , where are the religious leaders ; we follow sermons , political and religious statements , public meetings , statements in commerce and business areas , " @entity10 said , suggesting that through this accumulation of information , they see connections in @entity250 , @entity251 and elsewhere and can project connections within the region			0
@entity13 's analysis of large data and civil society enabled the @entity210 opposition to build mass - communications and improve internal and external communications networks and develop civilian leadership capacity for if there 's a change in government			1
introducing new narratives in a @entity277 , @entity10 said the @entity24 and its allies were under the impression that " militias " were one of the big problems in that country			1
as a result , @entity10 and his team " dug down and looked at who are these militias ? where are they located ? and how is the pattern of violence manifested ? " through the study of human patterns and civil - society data - gathering			1
" @entity295 streets became our study ground , as did civil society and social media , " @entity10 said			1
by using large data analysis in a strategic effort to advance stability in @entity277 , " it was not your typical police , but rather the @entity295 civil society that was the antidote to the militia violence , " @entity10 said			2
by looking at social networking , open sources and the civil society , analysts got a better picture of @entity295 ' attitude toward @entity24 , which helped " understand trend lines against @entity24 â € ” that potentially led us to learn that @entity295 were simply horrified -- @entity295 were actually horrified -- by the killing of ambassador @entity319 , " @entity10 said of the @entity24 diplomat who was killed in a terror attack on the @entity24 diplomatic compound in @entity323 last september			2
moving forward , @entity10 suggests that by looking at these reactions , instead of a military and counter terrorism approach , we can build - up " myth - busters " and thus introduce new narratives that can help prevent violence , not just in only @entity277 , but the region at large			2
thousands of miles away from where the @entity332 bloomed , @entity13 is applying similar methods in @entity335 , where more than 1,000 people were killed and 350,000 displaced after the 2007 elections			0
last year @entity10 and his team integrated similar patterns of large data analysis to help @entity335 prevent violence during last month 's elections			0
@entity341 is another conflicted area that remains a pivotal threat not only for the @entity24 but also for the rest of the world			2
both @entity66 and @entity345 , director of partnerships and communication at @entity13 , say the area lacks readily available " information clouds " that make up the first layer of large data analysis			0
but by using its analytical tools , it 's possible to fill in data gaps by correlating conditions in comparable environments			0
preventing another @entity357 there is also strong potential in using large data analytics in the @entity24 to help forecast terror attacks like the bombing at the @entity363 two weeks ago			1
" absolutely we can make this work domestically in the @entity24 , however the challenge is that people guard their privacy from the government very closely , so then we might face privacy - issue challenges when running human patterns and large data in the @entity24 , " @entity216 said .			1

analyzing human behavior , social media , other data points a @entity2 tool
modeling looked at @entity63 , @entity210 , @entity277 , @entity341 and other *hot* spots
data - driven approach is contrary to conventional " top - down " wisdom
