a large framed picture on a wall in the back room brought back one of my happiest childhood memories -- it was the team photo of the @entity115 , who brought the first and only @entity118 baseball championship to @entity18			1
outside was a small " garden " where @entity120 , wife of the store 's owner , helped us pick out an appropriate headstone			1
my godmother liked the one with the rose - leaf pattern because her father once wrote her a poem -- also published in his newspaper -- titled , " @entity129			0
