@entity1 society has a double standard when it comes to sexuality			1
we have a puritanical taboo against talking about sexuality directly , yet we are fine with the sexual images that pervade television and glossy magazines			1
we sexualize children in advertising by turning girls into objects that bear little resemblance to what young women actually look like			0
and we do this in movies where even animated characters take on curvaceous hips and big breasts			0
but then when it comes to our kids having some kind of sexual identity , we freak out			1
we vilify sexting , or sending sexually explicit messages and images via text messaging			1
but sexting , if not taken to the extreme or exploited by bullies , is not the social evil that it is made out to be			1
sexting is a normal part of human sexual expression not only for adolescents , but for adults as well			1
new data from the @entity41 show that adults 25 to 34 years old are more likely to sext than those in other age groups			0
anxious parents might think that sexting leads to a slew of negative consequences like early and risky sexual behavior			1
but there is evidence to suggest this is not the case			0
the proportion of @entity1 adolescents who are sexually active has declined in recent years ( though the rates are still high and warrant concern )			1
adolescent pregnancy rates have also declined over the last two decades , perhaps due to more teenagers using contraception			1
sexting is not related to riskier sexual behaviors like having unprotected sex			1
about the only thing sexting is related to is sexual activity — adolescents who are sexually active are more likely to sext			1
sexting does n't indicate a significant change in teenage sexual behaviors ; it just makes teenage sexual behaviors more visible to adults			1
sexting can help adolescents discover their sexual identity , something that is developmentally appropriate in the teenage years , whether they are sexting or not			1
but sexting is not without problems			1
because laws have not yet caught up with the realities of technology use , in some states , a minor could potentially be charged under child pornography laws for sexting			2
there are a few , rare instances when this has happened			0
in these cases , there is usually quite a bit of backlash against prosecutors attempting to indict minors under child pornography laws			0
seventeen states have created legislation that either decriminalizes sexting or makes it a misdemeanor			2
states like @entity97 and @entity98 make the creation , possession , or sending of a nude image of a minor by a minor a non-criminal violation for the first offense			0
that being said , there is nothing stopping an overzealous prosecutor in another state from making an example of a teenager and charging him with the most severe penalty possible			0
the social consequences of sexting are more troubling			1
messages shared in confidence can be shared with other people or broadcast to a wider audience			0
luckily , this does n't happen often			0
one study found only 2 % of sexters had their photo shared with someone they did n't want to see it			0
although it 's unlikely , imagine how future employers might evaluate your daughter if they @entity131 her and find a sexually explicit image			2
what is more likely is that your teenage daughter 's peers will share and shame her for the image			2
in the worst cases , sexting can lead to tragedy			2
thirteen - year - old @entity140 sexted a photo to her boyfriend			0
somehow , a classmate got hold of the photo and passed it around			0
before you know it , the photo went viral			0
@entity140 committed suicide reportedly after repeated bullying and taunts from other students who called her names like " slut " or " whore			2
" eighteen - year - old @entity153 also committed suicide reportedly after her boyfriend circulated a nude picture of her that was meant to be seen in confidence			0
they show that we must educate young people , especially young men , about how harmful such acts can be			0
and as a society , we must do more to raise awareness and combat bullying and cyberbullying			1
if sexting is not abused and done discretely , it is an acceptable form of exploration of sexual identity , especially for adolescents			1
you can talk about sexting as a way to talk with your teenage son or daughter about safe sex			2
once you have established a good rapport , explain the pitfalls of sexting — that if they 're not careful , nude images of them can be shared with the whole world and used to harm their reputations			2
adolescents are naturally impulsive because the teenage brain is still developing the ability to self - regulate			0
try to be understanding and keep your cool			0
remember : sexting is the ultimate form of safe sex — the sender and receiver are not even in the same room .			2

@entity195 : @entity1 society has a double standard when it comes to sexuality
@entity201 : sexting , if not abused or exploited , is not a social evil
he says sexting is a way to express one 's sexual identity , especially for teenagers
