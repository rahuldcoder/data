-- i logged onto @entity2 this afternoon , terrified of what i would read			0
i grew up near @entity4 , @entity5 , and went to high school in @entity7 , @entity5			2
a close friend spent her childhood at @entity10 , the school where a shooter killed at least 26 people today , police said , most of them children			0
police reports are still coming in , and we are only beginning to grasp the scale of this tragedy			0
friends are describing their panic as they try to reach their children in schools that are on lockdown			0
one of my high school classmates is trying to support her best friend , whose daughter was one of the children killed			0
my @entity2 timeline is filled with expressions of relief for those who escaped the violence , sorrow for those lost , and prayers for recovery			2
it 's also filled with friends demanding that @entity41 take action on gun control			1
their calls are answered by others who protest that this is a time to mourn , not a time for politics			2
a tragedy like today 's shooting demands we both mourn and take action			2
in april of this year , @entity51 shot 10 nursing students at @entity53 in @entity54 , @entity55			0
in july , @entity56 shot 70 people in a movie theater in @entity59 , @entity60			0
in august , @entity61 shot 10 people in a @entity64 gurdwara in @entity65 , @entity66			0
with today 's tragedy , 2012 is likely to be the worst year for mass gun violence in @entity41 history			1
it follows a year in which a mass shooting killed six and critically injured rep. @entity73			2
and on tuesday two people killed when a gunman opened fire at a shopping mall in @entity78			0
news : ' our hearts are broken ' outside of these mass shooting incidents covered by the media , 2012 is likely to be a bad one in terms of " ordinary " shootings			2
the @entity86 reports that 30,759 were treated in hospitals for gunshot wounds in 2011 , a 47 % increase over 2001			0
homicide rates in the @entity41 are going down while incidences of shootings are increasing , because doctors are now so experienced at treating gunshot wounds that they are saving more lives			2
yet conventional wisdom argues that the @entity41 is too polarized and divided for any meaningful changes to our broken and inadequate gun laws			1
the @entity100 and other lobbying groups are too well - funded and powerful for politicians to stand behind even modest gun control measures , like sen. @entity105 's proposed ban on high - capacity magazines , which lapsed in 2004			1
americans who follow the gun - control debate have stopped expecting change in the wake of events like today 's shooting for the simple reason of precedent : if @entity59 , @entity65 , @entity116 and @entity117 have n't changed the politics of gun control , why should we believe the tragedy in @entity4 will have a different outcome ? the @entity100 's most powerful weapon against gun control is n't postcard campaigns , primary battles or political advertising			1
so long as we assume gun control is impossible , we do n't talk about gun control			1
so long as we do n't talk about gun control , gun control is impossible			1
the @entity100 fights any attempts to control firearms , no matter how common - sensical , because their greatest fear is public debate over any controls over guns			0
once we begin discussing whether it 's reasonable for civilians to be able to buy unlimited amounts of ammunition without a background check , we 've moved gun control from the realm of the unthinkable into the possible			1
news : support crucial for kids after trauma it sounds reasonable and compassionate when @entity150 gov. @entity149 responded to the @entity59 shootings by demanding , " this is just not the appropriate time to be grandstanding about gun laws			0
can we at least get through the initial grief and tragedy for these families ? " @entity149 , and my friends on @entity2 who demand we mourn apolitically , have the best of intentions , but they are missing a simple truth			1
moments like today 's tragedy in @entity4 remind us that the @entity41 suffers from an epidemic of gun violence , a pattern that does not exist in other highly developed nations			1
moments of crisis , like the shooting in @entity4 , tend to produce brief spikes of popular interest in gun control			1
my research on media attention suggests these spikes are extremely short - lived , and that they may be decreasing in intensity			0
there was less popular interest in gun control , as measured by @entity182 searches , after the @entity73 shooting and the @entity59 killings than after @entity185 there were almost no spikes of popular interest in gun control after " smaller " mass shootings , like that in @entity65			1
to have any chance of combating the @entity100 's campaign of silence , gun control groups have to seize moments of media attention to push for change			1
when the story about the @entity4 shooter comes out , it is likely that we will hear about a disturbed and deranged shooter and about " senseless violence , " as if to distinguish it from more sensible gun violence			1
this language turns mass shootings into natural disasters , as unpredictable and preventable as hurricanes and tornados			0
human behavior is unpredictable , but gun violence is not			1
in @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 today , a deranged man slashed 22 schoolchildren with a knife			0
school shootings in @entity41 are a product both of mad people and bad laws			2
as we learn more about the young children killed in @entity4 today , we will hear calls not to " politicize " their deaths			2
i urge you to ignore those calls			0
there is no better way to mourn these senseless deaths than to demand we change our laws and our culture so that the killing of innocent children truly becomes unthinkable			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity240 .			0

@entity240 : friends react to @entity4 shooting with grief , prayers , calls for gun control
he says some say talk about gun control *insensitive* ; he says *no.* we must mourn and act
he says 2012 may be worst year for gun violence in @entity41 , yet we avoid talk of gun control
*writer* : best way to mourn these deaths is to demand we change our laws , our culture
