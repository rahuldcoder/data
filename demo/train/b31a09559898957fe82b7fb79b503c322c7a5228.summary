the surviving suspect in the @entity3 bombings suffered an injury to his throat and may not be able to talk , a federal official told @entity6 on saturday , possibly hindering attempts by authorities to question him about a motive in the attack			1
with one suspect dead , authorities believe answers to a motive and whether the brothers had help rest with @entity16 , who was captured friday night just minutes after authorities had indicated that a massive manhunt for the suspect appeared to come up empty			1
the official , who was briefed on @entity16 's condition , spoke on condition of anonymity			1
@entity16 was in " serious but stable condition " and " not yet able to communicate yet , " @entity24 gov. @entity23 told reporters during an impromptu briefing on saturday			1
federal prosecutors are at the heavily guarded @entity29 , where @entity16 is being treated for wounds			1
authorities have not publicly detailed the injuries sustained by the teen , but an official who has been briefed said @entity16 has been " intubated and sedated			1
" the official also spoke on condition of anonymity			1
" i , and i think all of the law enforcement professionals , are hoping for a host of reasons that the suspect survives , because we have a million questions , and those questions need to be answered			1
there are parts of the investigation , in terms of information and evidence , that still needs to be run to ground , " @entity23 said			1
authorities have not said whether they have questioned @entity16 , nor have they publicly said what charges will be filed against the teen			1
but a @entity57 official , speaking on condition of anonymity , told @entity6 the teen will face federal terrorism charges and possibly state murder charges			1
the government has invoked the public safety exception , a designation that allows investigators to question the teen without reading him his @entity69 rights and without a lawyer present , another @entity57 official , also speaking on condition of anonymity , told @entity6			1
@entity16 , 19 , and his older brother , 26 - year - old @entity71 , are accused of setting off two bombs near the finish line of the @entity3 on monday , killing three people and leaving more than 170 wounded			1
the arrest of @entity16 brought to an end a manhunt that paralyzed @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 as authorities searched door to door for a suspect not only believed to be behind the bombings , but who they feared also could unleash more explosives			1
acting alone ? so far , evidence suggests that the two brothers acted alone in the bombings and subsequent shootout , @entity79 police chief @entity87 said			1
" from what i know right now , these two acted together and alone , " @entity87 told @entity6 on saturday			2
" i think we have to be ever vigilant , and we 're learning as we go along , but as far as this little cell -- this little group -- i think we got our guys			2
" even so , questions remain			1
" why did these young men who grew up and studied here as part of our communities and our country resort to such violence ? how did they plan and carry out these attacks ? and did they receive any help ? the families of those killed so senselessly deserve answers , " president @entity108 said friday in a televised address			2
24 hours of chaos shortly after the @entity114 released photos of the suspects thursday night , @entity16 and his older brother led authorities on a wild car chase and shootout			1
officials say the brothers , for no obvious reason , killed @entity125 police officer @entity124 while he was sitting in his car			2
the @entity127 then hijacked a @entity128 , telling the driver they were the marathon bombers , and hurled explosives at the pursuing officers , authorities said			2
" there was an exchange of over 200 rounds of gunfire , there were improvised explosive devices , and handmade hand grenades thrown at the officers at the scene , " @entity80 police commissioner @entity139 said			2
@entity71 ran out of ammunition during the shootout and was tackled by officers			2
that 's when the younger @entity16 drove the @entity128 toward the officers and his brother			1
" they dive out of the way , and he ( the younger brother ) drives over his brother and drags him a short distance down the street , " @entity87 said			1
@entity71 was later pronounced dead at the hospital			2
he was wearing explosives and a triggering device when he died , a source briefed on the investigation told @entity6			2
the @entity114 , while executing a search warrant at a residence believed to have been affiliated with @entity16 , took three people into custody for questioning friday			1
it was unclear saturday what information the @entity114 was seeking and whether the three were released			2
' pool of blood ' the dramatic end to the manhunt came when a @entity79 man , cooped up in his house all day because of a " shelter in place " order , finally stepped outside when the order was lifted			2
@entity175 soon noticed the tarp covering the boat in his backyard was flapping in the wind and a retention strap was cut			2
he also noticed a small amount of blood on the tarp			2
" he basically stuck his head under the tarp , noticed a pool of blood , " @entity175 's stepson @entity184 told @entity6			2
@entity175 called 911 , @entity184 said			0
authorities arrived and evacuated @entity184 's stepfather			0
using a bullhorn , they called out to the suspect : " come out with your hands up			1
" we used a robot to pull the tarp off the boat , " @entity198 of the @entity199 said			0
" we were also watching him with a thermal imaging camera in our helicopter			0
he was weakened by blood loss -- injured last night , most likely			0
" a gunfight ensued , with more than 20 rounds fired			0
authorities eventually rushed the boat and took the teen into custody			0
cheers and mourning as word of the arrest spread , hundreds of residents swarmed the streets of @entity79 and @entity80 , surrounding police cars and cheering them on			0
but the celebrations were tempered by the deaths of four people this week , all allegedly by the hands of the @entity16 brothers			1
three spectators were killed in the marathon bombings , and @entity124 , the @entity125 police officer , was fatally shot early friday			0
at least 57 people remained hospitalized saturday afternoon , including three in critical condition , according to a @entity6 count			1

mistaken identity adds to family 's grief over @entity80 victim the family of 8 - year - old @entity244 , who was killed in the bombings , issued a statement thanking the authorities and members of the public who helped track down the two suspects			0
" none of this will bring our beloved @entity244 back , or reverse the injuries these men inflicted on our family and nearly two hundred others , " the @entity244 family said			0
