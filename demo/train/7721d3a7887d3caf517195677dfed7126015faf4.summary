-- @entity2 exposure from eating fish does n't appear to raise the risk of heart disease and stroke , as some research has suggested , according to a new study in the @entity9			1
the study -- the largest of its kind to date -- should help settle long - standing uncertainty about whether mercury from fish , which in high doses is believed to cause developmental delays in fetuses and infants , might also impact the heart health of adults			1
" this research provides really robust evidence that mercury exposure from fish consumption at levels commonly seen in [ the ] @entity35 and similar countries is not linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease , " says @entity22 , @entity23 , the lead author of the study and an associate professor of cardiovascular medicine at @entity27 and @entity28 , in @entity29			1
" for the average consumer who 's worried about mercury in fish , our study suggests that cardiovascular toxicity should not be a concern			2

in the study , in fact , the participants with the highest mercury exposure appeared to be at slightly less risk of heart attack and stroke than those with the lowest exposure , a trend that is probably due to the benefits of fish consumption rather than the mercury itself , the researchers say			2
fish ingest mercury , an industrial by - product , when it collects in rivers and oceans			0
@entity2 levels tend to be more concentrated toward the top of the underwater food chain , as smaller fish ( such as sardines and shrimp ) are eaten by larger fish ( such as swordfish and tuna )			0
fish - oil supplements , which many people take to promote heart health , have not been found to contain mercury , says @entity87 , @entity23 , a cardiologist and professor of medicine at the @entity90 , in @entity91 , @entity92 @entity0 : supplements for cholesterol : what works ? for years , health officials have warned pregnant women , nursing mothers , and young children to limit their fish consumption due to concerns about the apparent link between mercury exposure and subtle delays in the brain development of infants and children			1
neurological problems stemming from mercury - laden fish do not appear to be a concern for adults , but doctors have been less certain about the effects of mercury on heart health			1
some experts have suggested , for instance , that mercury could affect heart health by interfering with heart function , promoting blood clots , or neutralizing antioxidants			1
to test this theory , @entity22 and his colleagues measured mercury levels in the stored toenail clippings of 3,427 people with a history of heart disease , heart attack , or stroke , and compared them with an equal number of demographically similar people without heart problems			2
( toenail clippings are a common way of measuring mercury exposure			0
) @entity0 : 10 healthy fish recipes the participants , who were part of two long - running government studies known as the @entity142 and the @entity143 , also answered detailed questions about their dietary habits			0
the average mercury concentrations were about the same in both groups , 0.23 versus 0.25 micrograms per gram			0
( by comparison , 0.4 micrograms per gram is considered the upper limit of safety for pregnant moms and infants			0
) the researchers found no relationship between mercury exposure and the risk of heart attack and stroke , even in people with mercury concentrations of up to 1 microgram per gram			2
" any way we looked at it , we found no evidence for higher risk , " says @entity22 , who is also an associate professor of epidemiology at the @entity162			0
in short , there is no reason to change the current dietary recommendations regarding fish and mercury , @entity87 adds			0
@entity0 : healthy fish choices the @entity172 generally recommends that people eat fish at least twice a week , limiting their consumption of large , predatory fish that might have higher mercury levels			1
the @entity178 , meanwhile , urges pregnant women and young children to eat no more than two servings of fish per week			2
these groups should stick with salmon , catfish , canned light tuna , and other low - mercury species , and should avoid high - mercury species altogether , the agency says			0

the study should settle whether mercury from fish , might also impact the heart health of adults .
it 's also good for your heart , thanks to its low levels of saturated fat
the @entity172 recommends that people eat fish at least twice a week
