-- the @entity2 government is the largest financial entity in the world			1
on sunday , april 29 , it will be exactly three years since the @entity6 passed a budget			1
if you own or work for a small business that has a loan from a bank , i 'm quite sure your business has a budget -- and a rather detailed budget at that			2
every year around tax time , many @entity2 families sit down to fill out tax forms , estimate their income , and set spending priorities for the upcoming year			1
it 's the responsible thing to do			0
and yet , senate majority leader @entity23 appears to believe it is not necessary for the @entity6 to fulfill its legal responsibility by debating and passing a budget to account for $ 3.8 trillion in federal spending next fiscal year , $ 15.6 trillion of debt and , according to figures produced by the @entity33 @entity32 staff , more than $ 65 trillion in additional unfunded liabilities			1
to provide some perspective to these incomprehensible numbers , the total net private asset base -- that is , the net value of all household assets , small business assets , and large business assets -- of the @entity2 is $ 82 trillion , according to figures from the @entity43 from march 8 , 2012			2
even worse , president @entity44 and his administration seem to view budgeting as just one more political maneuver			2
his efforts have been so completely unserious that the president 's 2012 budget was rejected by a vote of 97 - 0 in the @entity6			1
and three weeks ago , when rep. @entity53 , @entity55 - @entity54 , sponsored a budget proposal based on @entity44 's 2013 budget plan , it lost in the @entity58 by a vote of 414 - 0			2
that 's right , not a single member of @entity62 cast a vote in favor of @entity44 's last two budgets			0
that is a stunning repudiation of his leadership			0
what it really represents is a total abdication of leadership			0
democrats in the @entity6 have all the votes they need to pass a real budget and show the @entity2 people their plan for today and the future			1
but they refuse , because they do n't want to be held accountable			0
they would rather cut backroom deals that hide the details of their plans , and then take political pot shots at @entity32 who have had the courage to produce and vote for a serious budget			2
@entity74 claim that last year 's @entity91 is an adequate substitute for a real budget because it " deems " spending caps			1
obviously , it is not			0
it is only half the equation			0
it includes no plan for saving @entity100 or @entity101 , for reforming taxes , or for ever living within our means			0
but it does prove that @entity106 is certainly good at making sure spending continues			0
business owners and consumers all over @entity2 are watching @entity106 , shaking their heads in disgust , and holding on to their wallets			2
these are the people we need to get our economy moving again , but these are the very people that are under assault by @entity44 and his policies			1
the @entity44 administration 's agencies are regulating business to death , limiting the use of @entity2 's domestic energy resources , threatening to punish success by increasing tax burdens , and providing no credible plan for reining in our debt and deficit			1
as self - defeating as all of these policies have been , not having a credible long - term budget plan might prove to be the most harmful			0
for the 30 years from 1970 through 1999 , the average borrowing cost of the @entity2 government was 5.3 % , according to an analysis made by my staff of figures from the @entity137			1
during that period , the ratio of our debt to our @entity141 ( gdp ) averaged 47 % and never exceeded 67 %			0
we were a far more creditworthy nation back then than we are today			0
now our debt - to - gdp ratio exceeds 100 % , and over the last three years , @entity2 's borrowing cost has been kept at an artificially low rate of 1.5 %			1
how long can that last ? nobody knows			0
what we do know is that if our borrowing costs were to revert to the 1970 - through - 1999 average of 5.3 % , @entity2 's annual interest expense would increase by $ 600 billion -- an amount that equals 50 % of discretionary spending			1
out of our $ 3.8 trillion annual budget , only $ 1.3 trillion is discretionary spending subject to appropriation and some level of control			0
everything else , roughly $ 2.5 trillion , is mandatory and entitlement spending that is on automatic pilot -- with no requirement to ensure financial solvency of these programs			0
increased interest expense resulting from higher rates , the true cost of @entity170 , and reduced revenues from slower economic growth caused by uncertainty and lack of confidence , all significantly raise the risk of dramatically higher debt and deficits			0
employer surveys by @entity180 , as well as analysis by former congressional budget office director @entity182 , show that far more @entity2 will lose employer - provided care than @entity186 estimates			1
additionally , @entity62 is unlikely to implement the hundreds of billions in @entity101 cuts that are called for in the president 's health care law it is past time for @entity44 , and his allies in @entity62 , to show the @entity2 people a credible plan to address our looming financial crisis			1
it is time for @entity74 to pass a budget			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity201			2
