@entity0 -- global energy giant @entity2 will be forced to face a lawsuit over alleged murder and torture committed by company agents in remote @entity7 , after a federal appeals court said friday that corporations can not claim immunity from liability			1
a divided 2 - 1 panel of the @entity13 reinstated a massive lawsuit filed by 15 @entity7 villagers from the oil - rich province of @entity17			1
they claim government security forces working for @entity2 committed brutal oppression while guarding a natural gas facility in 2000 - 01			1
at issue is whether foreign nationals can go into @entity26 courts to press civil claims stemming from actions overseas by @entity30 citizens in a time of martial law			2
the decision will have widespread implications for multinational corporations doing business in other countries			2
" it would create a bizarre anomaly to immunize corporations from liability for the conduct of their agents in lawsuits brought for ' shockingly egregious violations of universally recognized principles of international law , ' " wrote judge @entity38 in a detailed , 112 - page opinion			2
" the law of the @entity26 has been uniform since its founding that corporations can be held liable for the torts committed by their agents			2
this is confirmed in international practice , both in treaties and in legal systems throughout the world			0
" @entity58 was supported by her colleague judge @entity59 , both named to the bench by president @entity62			0
@entity64 spokesman @entity63 said the ruling was being reviewed , and that the @entity68 , @entity69 - based firm has " fought these baseless claims for many years			0
" " the plaintiffs ' claims are without merit , " he said			0
" while conducting its business in @entity7 , @entity2 has worked for generations to improve the quality of life in @entity17 through employment of local workers , provision of health services and extensive community investment			1
" the company strongly condemns human rights violations in any form			0
" the litigation is more than a decade old			0
the company had contracted with the @entity7 government to explore , extract , and process the gas			1
it hired military personnel as private security for the remote location			0
a key sticking point in the legal fight was the level of control @entity2 officials in @entity17 had over the actions of the @entity7 military			1
the plaintiffs alleged company officials in @entity7 were aware the military had committed past human rights violations			2
and they claim @entity2 offered " material support " by separately hiring private mercenaries who provided " advice , training , intelligence , and equipment " to the dedicated military unit , which in turn committed brutal repression of locals , according to the lawsuit			1
other allegations included sexual assault , battery , kidnapping , and false imprisonment against the villagers , many of whom had protested the presence of the company , fearing ecological and cultural damage to the region			2
those questions will now be presented at trial , as the lawsuit is allowed to proceed			0
there was no timetable for when that trial will begin			0
in dissent , judge @entity133 , appointed by president @entity134 , said the federal law in question , the @entity136 , applies only to actions committed in the @entity26			1
" the presumption helps the @entity26 avoid conflicts with other nations , which of course have a strong interest in policing and regulating conduct in their own countries , " @entity133 wrote			0
" the @entity136 contains no textual indication that it was meant to apply to conduct in foreign countries			1
" the issue may eventually reach the @entity152 , since lower federal courts have disagreed on the liability of conduct by @entity26 companies operating around the world			0
the case is @entity158 v. @entity2 ( 09 - 7125 ) .			1

@entity2 can not claim immunity in the case , an appeals panel says
a lawsuit filed by @entity7 villagers *accuses* @entity2 agents of murder and torture
the case *hinges* on whether the @entity136 applies to actions in other countries
