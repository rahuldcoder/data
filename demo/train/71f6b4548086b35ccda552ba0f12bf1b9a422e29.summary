-- when " @entity3 " season 12 premiered lower in the ratings than last year , that was to be expected — returning weaker has been the show 's trend for several years			1
when " idol " numbers dipped after the show moved from auditions to the @entity11 rounds , that was also to be expected too — the reality veteran 's ratings tend to sag during the middle portion of its run every year			2
but " idol " is dropping nearly every week and last night was down 50 percent from its thursday night premiere this season ... and that 's scary			1
@entity0 : ' @entity22 ' mr. @entity21 on set ! thursday 's " idol " fell another 7 percent down to 11.7 million viewers and a 2.8 rating among adults 18 - 49			1
again : a 2.8 rating			0
for the first time ever , @entity32 's " @entity31 " topped " idol " in these early numbers			2
hell , " scandal " nearly tied " idol ! " here 's " @entity3 's " wednesday night track in the demo since its debut this season : 6.0 , 5.5 , 5.5 , 4.6 , 4.3 , 4.1 , 3.9 , 3.8 , 3.8 , 3.6			1
while thursday 's trend has been : 5.6 , 5.2 , 4.5 , 4.1 , 3.7 , 3.9 , 3.8 , 3.6 , 3.1 and then last night 's preliminary 2.8 , down 33 percent from last year 's airing this week			1
the only time the show 's ratings have gone up this season was the week after @entity44 ( which is a traditionally soft night for tv viewing )			2
@entity0 : @entity49 's ' @entity48 ' plan , some ask why elsewhere on the grid : @entity32 's regular - folks version of " @entity52 " was up from its last season premiere			0
" @entity31 " was up 12 percent			0
a special " @entity56 " at 8:30 was softer than " @entity54 " in the slot			0
@entity60 's " @entity59 " perked up a tenth for last night 's punk rock episode			1
