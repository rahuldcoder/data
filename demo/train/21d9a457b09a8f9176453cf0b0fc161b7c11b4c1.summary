the couple deny charges of murdering @entity18 , one of three children they adopted from @entity21			1
both the defense and the prosecution presented written and oral arguments to the court tuesday			1
in his statement , the prosecutor painted a picture of @entity30 and @entity31 as inhumane people who had been " cheaply sold " their adopted child			1

he said the @entity41 kept @entity18 locked in her room , deprived of food and water , and that a key was found on the outside of the door			1
the prosecutor argued that both the hospital and forensics reports on her death indicated that she died of starvation and that any witness statements should be discounted by the court			2
he also cited testimony from one of the girl 's brothers , saying the child told prosecutors that their parents used to punish @entity18 for stealing food by locking her into her room			1
medical records defense lawyer @entity65 argued that there is no evidence to indicate the couple had wanted to kill their daughter			1
witnesses had seen @entity18 eating on the friday and the monday before her death in the early hours of tuesday , january 15 , the lawyer said , adding that two days without food would not have been enough for her to starve to death			1
he also pointed to hospital and forensic reports that showed she died of dehydration and cachexia , a wasting condition			0
this can result from causes other than starvation , @entity65 said			0
the reports showed that her pancreas was inflamed , which could mean it was n't working properly , and there was inflammation of the lungs , he said			0
the reports also showed that @entity18 had ingested food and liquid that was still in her intestines and bladder , he said			1
the defense lawyer also cited @entity18 's siblings as telling the prosecutor she had been playing with them outside her room before she died			1
other witnesses had also seen her the day before her death , he said			2
@entity65 added that photographs showed bottles of water beside the child 's bed and that , in any case , her room had a bathroom where she could have drunk the water from the taps if she needed to			2
he said her medical records showed that she had a history of eating disorders			0
defense effort the judge ordered that the defense be given another chance to rebut the prosecution 's arguments in a hearing february 5			1
the two defendants appeared more relaxed and better rested than in their previous court appearance , when they were still in detention			0
@entity30 , who had previously appeared in court with her head covered , was this time dressed in slacks and a blouse with her hair uncovered			2
no relatives of the @entity41 ' were in court tuesday , but a handful of staff members from the @entity135 in @entity0 were present			0
the @entity136 , an advocacy group for @entity137 overseas , has been coordinating the @entity41 ' defense effort			0
in august , the agency set up a website that describes the circumstances of their detention			0
@entity11 and @entity143 moved to @entity1 in 2012 with their three adopted children			0

but everything changed january 15 , when he found his daughter dead			0
