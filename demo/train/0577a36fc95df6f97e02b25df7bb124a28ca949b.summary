@entity0 , @entity1 -- with all eyes focused on how the @entity7 will do this november , the story about the divisions unfolding within the @entity5 have equally important long - term consequences for national politics			1
and now with the @entity12 movement as an additional force in the party , @entity5 leaders are struggling to contain tensions between right - wing activists and fiscal conservatives			0
in recent months , these tensions have been growing because new faces have emerged within the @entity5 that do n't fit neatly within the @entity12 fold			0
one of the candidates who has received the most buzz in @entity5 circles is @entity1 gov. @entity23 , dubbed " gov. @entity25 " by one columnist			1
how @entity23 fares in the coming year will be a critical test to gauging where the @entity5 might be in 2012			1
the blunt and humorous @entity5 who replaced @entity7 gov. @entity31 has been making a name for himself by taking on @entity1 's fiscal mess			1
@entity23 , a former @entity35 attorney general who looks and sounds like the kind of guy you would sit next to at a @entity39 game , has focused all of his energy on reducing the budget and limiting property tax increases			2
he has been willing to challenge powerful interest groups like the teachers ' unions , and he did n't budge when citizen protesters took to the streets and railed against the impact of his budget			0
@entity23 also instituted reforms to the pensions of government workers			0
he has received some grudging support from @entity7 and has persuaded the state legislature to go along with many controversial proposals , primarily because most experts acknowledge tough steps are needed to avoid having @entity1 become another @entity62			1
the first test for @entity23 will be the political response when @entity1 residents see the impact of the budget cuts			1
historically , at the national level , @entity5 have often backed off from tough talk about spending reduction when programs proved to be more popular than conservatives expected			2
this is what happened when president @entity75 was forced to back off @entity77 cuts in 1981 - 1982 and the @entity78 stepped away from @entity80 cuts in 1995 - 1996			0
in @entity1 , it is one thing for voters to hear tough talk on controlling spending coming out of @entity86 , but quite another to see your child 's school program shut down			2
now that congressional democrats are on the verge of passing legislation to provide aid to the states in these areas of government , the contrast will be even sharper			0
there are also many questions about whether @entity23 's actions will really be able to stop property taxes from rising			1
the second test has to do with whether @entity23 , assuming that he continues to be successful , can find a place at the national @entity5 table			1
in the era of the @entity12 , the @entity5 leadership has been moving toward the right on many nonfiscal issues			2
last week , senate minority leader @entity110 said he favored the idea of reviewing the 14th amendment -- originally passed to protect the citizenship rights of freed @entity115 - @entity35 slaves			0
some republicans , including @entity118 sen. @entity117 , want to make sure that citizenship rights are not granted to children who are born to illegal immigrants in the @entity35			0
also , the ruling by a federal judge that @entity62 's ban on gay marriage is unconstitutional is sure to generate pressure on @entity5 to take a tough stand on this issue			2
following the 2008 election , the conservative commentator and former speechwriter for president @entity131 , @entity132 , a @entity2 contributor , had warned that @entity5 needed to be cautious about doing things to win in 2010 that would harm them in 2012 and beyond			0
the threat is to radicalize the party by moving it so far off center that future @entity5 candidates would have trouble winning national office			2
as @entity132 wrote in his blog post with regard to health care reform , " we followed the most radical voices in the party and the movement , and they led us to abject and irreversible defeat			0
" if @entity5 want to rebuild their party , they must make room for more pragmatic , fiscally minded conservatives like @entity23 , who are generating excitement in famously blue states			1
if @entity23 can survive politically from the fallout of the budget cuts , he and other @entity5 like him could cause significant trouble for @entity7 by focusing on issues like taxes , deficits and spending that , at least on the campaign trail , have often had far more impact than the social issues that tend to excite the @entity5 's base			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity171 .			0

@entity171 : @entity1 gov. @entity23 is earning praise for *tackling* budget problems
he says @entity23 's focus on cutting spending is a test for the @entity5
it runs *counter* to a national @entity5 trend of *stressing* issues such as *birthright* citizenship , he says
@entity171 : @entity23 , others in @entity5 like him could give @entity7 trouble in many states
