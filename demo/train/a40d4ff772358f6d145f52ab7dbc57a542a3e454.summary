@entity1 , @entity0 -- predatory mice are threatening the albatross population on a remote south @entity9 island and have caused the birds ' worst nesting season on record , a @entity4 bird charity says			1
baby albatross on a remote @entity9 island are threatened by killer house mice			1
the research from the @entity17 indicates bad news for the @entity19 , whose only home is @entity22 in the middle of the south @entity9			1
@entity25 mice not native to the island are threatening the @entity19 with extinction , the @entity17 said			1
the mice are also threatening the native population of bunting , one of the world 's largest finches , the @entity17 said			1
" without removal of the mice , both the albatross and the bunting that live there are doomed to extinction , " @entity34 , a conservation spokesman for the @entity17 , told @entity2			1
the mice on the island eat the chicks of the albatross and bunting before they make it to the fledgling stage , the @entity17 said			1
this makes it especially difficult for the albatross population to survive because the birds lay eggs only once every two years -- a very low reproductive rate compared to other birds , @entity46 said			1
" what [ the mice ] are affecting is the ability of the albatross to produce enough young to sustain the population , " he said			1
adult @entity61 albatross are threatened by longline fishing at sea , a practice in which boats put up numerous 100 - meter long fishing lines baited with squid or fish			2
the albatrosses are attracted to the bait and while some manage to steal it successfully , many more get snagged and drown , @entity46 said			0
because of the impact from house mice , introduced to the island by sealers in the 18th and 19th centuries , conservation alliance @entity75 earlier this year listed both the @entity19 and the @entity82 bunting as critically endangered -- the highest threat level before extinction			1
@entity22 , a @entity4 territory almost midway between @entity85 and @entity86 , is a place of stunning natural beauty			0
the island is not inhabited by humans			2
@entity22 and nearby @entity91 are both listed as @entity92			0
a survey of the albatross on @entity22 in january showed 1,764 adults incubating eggs , the @entity17 said			2
a later survey revealed only 246 chicks had survived to fledgling			2
" we 've known for a long time that the mice were killing albatross chicks in huge numbers , " said @entity17 scientist @entity99 , who recently visited the island to assess the problem			1
" however , we now know that the albatrosses have suffered their worst year on record			0
" the bunting suffer because the mice eat their eggs and chicks , and may also compete with them for food in the winter , @entity99 said			1
" the decline in bunting numbers is alarming , " said @entity114 of the @entity115 , who has been studying buntings on the island since the 1980s			0
" without urgent conservation action to remove the mice , both the albatross and the bunting are living on borrowed time			2
" the @entity17 has been studying whether it is possible to remove the mice			0
it said trials so far look promising , but it urged the @entity4 government to step up funding for the project			0
it said eradicating the mice from @entity22 would solve the primary conservation threat facing both bird species			0
the @entity17 said it had been working with @entity137 conservationists on a program to remove the smaller mice by dropping poisoned bait from helicopters			0
@entity61 albatrosses are one of 22 species of albatross in the world			0
albatrosses principally live in the southern @entity9 but some also live in the @entity148 , the @entity17 says			2
albatrosses are among the largest flying birds , weighing up to 25 pounds ( 22.5 kilograms )			0
one species -- the wandering albatross -- has a wingspan of 11 feet , the @entity17 says			0
the birds can fly thousands of miles without a pause , and their only need to touch land is to nest and raise their young , the @entity17 says .			0
