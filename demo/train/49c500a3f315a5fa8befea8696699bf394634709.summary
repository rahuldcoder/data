somewhere in @entity1 , former president @entity0 is smiling			1
although some @entity2 are pleased that taxes will now go up on the wealthiest @entity4 , the recent deal to avert the fiscal cliff entrenches , rather than dismantles , one of @entity0 's signature legacies -- income tax cuts			1
ninety - nine percent of @entity4 households were protected from tax increases , aside from the expiration of the reduced rate for the payroll tax			0
in the final deal , @entity17 and president @entity18 agreed to preserve most of the @entity0 tax cuts , including exemptions on the estate tax			1
when @entity0 started his term in 2001 , many of his critics dismissed him as a lightweight , the son of a former president who won office as result of his family 's political fortune and a controversial decision by the @entity35 on the 2000 election			2
but what has become clear in hindsight , regardless of what one thinks of @entity0 and his politics , is that his administration left behind a record that has had a huge impact on @entity4 politics , a record that will not easily be dismantled by future presidents			2
the twin pillars of @entity0 's record were counterterrorism policies and tax cuts			1
during his first term , it became clear that @entity18 would not dismantle most of the homeland security apparatus put into place by his predecessor			1
despite a campaign in 2008 that focused on flaws with the nation 's response to 9/11 , @entity18 has kept most of the counterterrorism program intact			2
opinion : the real issue is runaway spending in some cases , the administration continues to aggressively use tactics his supporters once decried , such as relying on renditions to detain terrorist suspects who are overseas , as the @entity71 reported this week			2
in other areas , the administration has expanded the war on terrorism , including the broader use of drone strikes to kill terrorists			0
now come taxes and spending			0
with regard to the @entity0 tax cuts , @entity18 had promised to overturn a policy that he saw as regressive			1
although he always said that he would protect the middle class from tax increases , @entity18 criticized @entity0 for pushing through @entity17 policies that bled the federal government of needed revenue and benefited the wealthy			1
in 2010 , @entity18 agreed to temporarily extend all the tax cuts			1
though many @entity2 were furious , @entity18 concluded that he had little political chance to overturn them and he seemed to agree with @entity92 that reversing them would hurt an economy limping along after a terrible recession			2
opinion : time to toot horn for @entity97 with the fiscal cliff deal , @entity18 could certainly claim more victories than in 2010			1
taxes for the wealthiest @entity4 will go up			0
@entity17 also agreed to extend unemployment compensation and continue higher payments to @entity104 providers			0
but beneath all the sound and fury is the fact that the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts , for most @entity4 , are now a permanent part of the legislative landscape			1
( in addition , middle class @entity4 will breathe a sigh of relief that @entity17 has permanently fixed the @entity115 , which would have hit many of them with a provision once designed to make sure that the wealthy paid their fair share			0
) as @entity121 @entity92 rep. @entity92 remarked , " after more than a decade of criticizing these tax cuts , @entity2 are finally joining @entity92 in making them permanent			1
" indeed , the @entity122 estimates that the new legislation will increase the deficit by $ 4 trillion over the next 10 years			0
the tax cuts have significant consequences on all of @entity4 policy			1
opinion : @entity129 drops bomb on @entity92 leaders most important , the fact that a @entity2 president has now legitimated the moves of a @entity92 administration gives a bipartisan imprimatur to the legitimacy of the current tax rates			2
although some @entity92 signed on to raising taxes for the first time in two decades , the fact is that @entity2 have agreed to tax rates which , compared to much of the 20th century , are extraordinarily low			0
public perception of a new status quo makes it harder for presidents to ever raise taxes on most @entity4 to satisfy the revenue needs for the federal government			0
at the same time , the continuation of reduced taxes keeps the federal government in a fiscal straitjacket			0
as a result , politicians are left to focus on finding the money to pay for existing programs or making cuts wherever possible			0
new innovations in federal policy that require substantial revenue are just about impossible			0
to be sure , there have been significant exceptions , such as the @entity162			0
but overall , bold policy departures that require significant amounts of general revenue are harder to come by than in the 1930s or 1960s			0
republicans thus succeed with what some have called the " starve the beast " strategy of cutting government by taking away its resources			0
since the long - term deficit only becomes worse , @entity92 will continue to have ample opportunity to pressure @entity2 into accepting spending cuts and keep them on the defense with regards to new government programs			2
politics : are the days of @entity17 ' going big ' over ? with his income tax cuts enshrined , @entity0 can rest comfortably that much of the policy world he designed will remain intact and continue to define @entity4 politics			1
@entity18 has struggled to work within the world that @entity0 created , and with this legislation , even with his victories , he has demonstrated that the possibilities for change have been much more limited than he imagined when he ran in 2008 or even in 2012 .			1

@entity190 : for all the criticism @entity0 got , two *key* policies have survived
he says fiscal cliff pact *perpetuates* nearly all of @entity0 's tax cuts
@entity18 administration has *largely* followed @entity0 's homeland security policy , he says
@entity190 : by squeezing revenues , @entity0 tax cuts will put pressure on spending
