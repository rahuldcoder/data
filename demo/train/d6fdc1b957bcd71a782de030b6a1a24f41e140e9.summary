@entity0 -- three days after @entity2 walked into the @entity3 and randomly shot and killed 12 people , a congressional push for tougher gun laws still seems unlikely to materialize like it did following the the @entity9 school massacre			2
but as more details emerge of @entity2 ' troubled past , lawmakers appear to be reframing the debate over gun violence , this time with emphasis on better treatment for mental health			1
the exasperated gun control debate takes a turn after the december shooting at @entity9 and a @entity22 movie theater massacre the previous july that resulted in an insanity plea by the shooter , lawmakers and advocates on both sides of the gun debate called for improved mental health services			1
but those calls were drowned out by the more emotional and better - funded debate over gun control			1
now , sen. @entity33 , @entity34 , wants to re-introduce a mental health measure that had overwhelming support across party lines earlier this year			1
co-authored by sen. @entity39 , @entity40 , the legislation calls for more training and familiarity with services in schools and communities			2
the measure was added as an amendment to the broader gun control package in the @entity49 earlier this year , and while the chamber approved @entity33 's amendment by a wide margin , 95 - 2 , the overall package failed			1
the mental health legislation went nowhere			1
now she 's trying to bring it back without attaching it to gun control bills			1
" i actually think it can be taken up separately and easily passed , " she said on @entity1 , pointing to the strong support the measure received in april			0
" very little gets 90 votes around here			2
" rep. @entity63 , @entity64 , also suggested a mental health bill can stand alone			1
" i think we ought to move , " @entity63 said on @entity66			0
" the gun issue has been so difficult			2
i think we ought to try to move forward with whatever pieces we can			0
" sen. @entity70 , @entity71 , said he still favors legislation for enhanced background checks but believes the mental health initiative should be the " centerpiece " in any new effort to stop gun violence			1
dampening the hope of gun control advocates , senate majority leader @entity78 told reporters in the aftermath of this week 's @entity3 slaughter that the votes are n't there to bring back the failed gun control legislation			1
pressed on whether he 'd consider a narrower version that strictly focuses on mental health , @entity78 simply said he " would hope it would have the votes			1
" " and i would be willing to do that , " he continued			0
" anything we can do to focus attention on these senseless killings that take place			0
" mental health as common ground the most avid control advocates are still poised to push ahead with their agenda			1
@entity101 held a rally thursday on @entity103 — an event scheduled before monday 's shooting — to keep pressure on lawmakers over expanded background checks			2
but as the investigation of @entity2 continues , the conversation is largely focused on red flags from his history that were seemingly overlooked			0
@entity2 had recently made contact with two @entity116 hospitals for apparent psychological issues and had exhibited signs of mental problems , @entity1 has learned			2
his father said he suffered from post-traumatic stress after working in 9/11 rescue efforts			0
@entity2 , who was shot dead by police , was also arrested repeatedly for alarming offenses			0
he left the @entity3 after eight instances of misconduct , @entity3 officials said			0
gun rights activists have fervently maintained gun violence stems from the deranged minds of individuals , and new gun restrictions wo n't do anything to curb the killings			2
the @entity135 has long been supportive of laws that keep guns out of the hands of those deemed mentally incompetent			0
following the @entity141 massacre , the @entity135 backed a 2007 law that encouraged states to submit records of dangerously mentally ill individuals to the @entity146			0
" the people that have been involved in these shootings have been people who have been severely mentally ill , " @entity147 , then - @entity135 president , said in january			0
data released last year by the @entity152 shows that of the nearly one million federal denials of gun purchase attempts between 1998 and 2012 , about 5,481 stemmed from mental health issues			2
only about half of states still report records of those at risk			0
as of late 2011 , 23 states and the @entity0 had submitted records to @entity146 , with 17 of those states submitting fewer than 10 records , according to a report compiled by @entity101			0
states face an array of logistical , technological and privacy obstacles in reporting those records , according to reports from government agencies and the @entity171			0
with that said , much work remains to be done for @entity174 if they decide to tackle mental health in the context of gun violence			1
a popular policy that 's gaining ground polls also indicate the public favors increased mental health treatment as a way to prevent gun violence			1
asked how much better mental health services would help the problem , 46 % said " a lot , " while 35 % said " some , " and 9 % said " not much , " according to a @entity189 poll from february 2013 — at the height of this year 's gun control debate			1
asked in the same survey how much stricter gun laws could help 21 % said " a lot , " 33 % said " some , " 19 % said " not much " and 26 % said " not at all			0
" when president @entity197 announced a series of 23 executive actions in his gun control push this year , four of them focused on mental health components			1
@entity203 spokesman @entity202 was asked after the @entity3 shooting whether @entity197 would push for renewed conversation about mental health and gun control — or , the reporter asked , does the president accept " this is the normal ? " " well , he does n't accept that it 's the new normal			1
he believes that @entity211 do n't and ca n't accept that , " @entity202 said			0
" we continue to call on @entity174 to listen to the voices of their constituents and legislate accordingly			0
and that includes mental health matters			2
