-- a piece of tarp that reads , " welcome to you , @entity5 " marks a barely - enclosed dirt field			0
at this orphanage , the only traces of shelter are the few tents that have n't yet been stripped by the strong winds			0
it 's my last day in @entity13 , and i 'm on a trip to bring food , water and supplies to @entity13 still displaced by the 2010 earthquake			1
the first stop is the orphanage , in the middle of one of @entity23 's largest tent cities			1
when i step out of the @entity24 , i begin to see the children -- they come out from behind the tarp			0
they 're dusty , sun - burnt , and smiling shyly			0
i 'm again thankful for the camera in my hand , my constant companion this week			0
the lens is always ready to capture the utter desolation , which has my mind reeling even after a week			0
at the sight of the vat of water that 's brought out from the car , the children abandon their toys : a soccer ball , a ragged stuffed animal , a paint - chipped wooden car			2
the youngest , still a toddler , takes the first sip			0
his cries , when the bottle is taken away from him , ensure one last turn before the water runs out			0
in @entity13 , even a few drops of water can stop a boy 's tears			1
my intentions of going to @entity13 were less than purely philanthropic			1
as a journalist , i planned on seeing the devastation firsthand , but i also wanted to be productive and lend a helping hand			2
it was n't without chagrin that i realized volunteering means choosing to give up control and becoming available and malleable to meet the needs of others			2
i 've traveled to other developing countries , but i was still unprepared for the the chaos that met me when i arrived			1
after several lost - in - translation phone calls and hours of waiting at the airport , i took a leap of faith , got into an suv with two men i 've never met before , and prayed that i would survive -- literally			2
it was more than luck that led me to @entity74 , a different orphanage from the one i had originally signed up to work with			0
here i was taken in with open arms by one of @entity13 's ultimate volunteers , @entity78			1
@entity80 has been fighting for @entity13 for more than 30 years			1
she 's the founder of @entity82 , which was established in 1977 and currently houses 130 children			2
on my first day at @entity74 , i met 8 - year - old @entity84 in the infirmary			1
she had been suffering from severe malnutrition at the tent - city orphanage , and @entity78 took her in			1
" when a child comes in here , many , you would not give a nickel for their life because they are so far gone , " @entity80 says			1
by the end of the week , @entity84 is asking me to help twirl ropes with her , so her younger girlfriends can jump in on a match of double dutch			1
" these kids do n't just need basic provisions , they need love and they need brothers and sisters to play with them and teach them , " says @entity101 , a pastor at @entity102 , in @entity103 , @entity104 , which supports @entity74			0
" we felt like it was time that we ca n't just send our money			0
we 've got to send ourselves also			0
" it 's not often that painting church pews and scrubbing floors can generate the same enthusiasm as joining in on a game of soccer or playing a round of spoons after a long day			2
during my one - week stay with @entity74 , i witnessed entire bunk beds get built from scratch in a matter of days , boxes of medicine get organized , and water filters get distributed to the outskirts of @entity13			1
none of which could 've been done without volunteers			2
as much as i felt productive organizing suitcases of donated clothing , the trip was an opportunity to be inspired through the people we met and by the selflessness we saw amid disheartening conditions			0
take @entity80 , who -- despite knowing that for every one child she helps , there are hundreds of " tent - city orphans " still suffering -- continues to fight			1
" i have been just challenged by her and inspired by her to just step out in faith and to step out of my comfort zone , " @entity101 says			0
he 's not the only one			0
i met a high school soccer team , an older couple , a fellow @entity150 -- each a volunteer , a title that transcends age , race , career and even the fact that i only know two phrases in @entity158			0
i went to @entity13 expecting to walk away with images of a devastated @entity13 -- and i did			1
the scene on my last day at the tent - city orphanage is unforgettable			1
however , i realize images of suffering are n't what drive volunteers to come back			2
it 's doing even the small tasks so that a recovered @entity84 has the strength to love on her fellow peers , which keeps us wanting to do more and believing that it can make a difference .			1

@entity0 's @entity174 traveled to @entity13 to witness the earthquake devastation and help *rebuild*
@entity177 met @entity78 , who has been volunteering in @entity13 for the past 30 years
@entity80 helps care for @entity84 , 8 , suffering from malnutrition after living in tent city
seeing @entity84 's recovery *encourages* volunteers to continue working
