-- here 's a record - setting job that qualifies as a " heavy lift			2
" on thursday , workers in @entity4 and @entity5 finished sliding a new nearly half - mile - long , 30 million - pound bridge from one set of piers to another , making it the " longest bridge in @entity11 -- and perhaps the world " -- to slide laterally into place , according to the @entity14			1
the @entity15 spans the @entity16 , linking @entity17 421 between @entity18 , @entity4 , and @entity15 , @entity5			1
starting wednesday , workers moved it 55 feet from temporary piers to permanent refurbished piers			1
high winds across the river forced a delay in the job , until it could be completed the next day			0
here 's how they did it : workers placed polished steel sliding plates on top of the refurbished piers			1
then , they pulled the bridge from the temporary piers to the refurbished piers with steel cables and eight computer - controlled hydraulic jacks			1

it measures 2,428 feet long and 40 feet wide			0
for drivers , it has two 12 - foot - wide lanes and shoulders measuring 8 feet			2
