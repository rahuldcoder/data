-- by now , everyone should know that aviation is the safest way to travel : even in parts of the world with a " high " accident rate , that rate is still far below other ways to get from point a to point @entity10 this level of safety is due to a tradition of hard work and technological advances that must continue			1
new threats emerge every day , but through proactive efforts in data collection and analysis , we do n't have to wait for an accident anymore -- we can mitigate these risks before they become real problems			0
so how do we square those facts with terrible tragedies such as @entity26 447 ? plane crashes do still occur , even with state - of - the - art aircraft			0
everyone in the industry must continue to work hard on safety			0
with the @entity26 447 final report published this week , we now have a clearer picture of the events that led to this tragedy			1
the report concluded that a series of errors by pilots and a failure to react effectively to technical problems led to the crash			1
we already knew much of what we happened that evening : the autopilot shut itself off when the air speed indicators failed and the plane " handed itself " to the co-pilot			1
for the next several minutes , it should have been a pretty benign situation , but the flight crew made some inexplicable decisions and ultimately the plane crashed in the ocean			1
what we must now try to understand is why the pilots reacted the way they did			1
in the past decade , we 've seen tremendous advances in automation in the cockpit			0
this automation has proven to be vital to raising the level of safety in aviation even higher and also to provide more efficient airline operations			0
it has removed some of the threat of human error during normal operations			1
pilots now spend most of their time monitoring the automation			1
but what happens when the automation turns itself off or fails for some reason ? @entity75 : has @entity77 mystery been solved ? the elephant in the room has always been that training standards have not kept up with the technological changes in aircraft			1
in the early days of aviation , training included how to recover from some of the most commonly - faced emergencies , such as a lost engine during take off			1
these scenarios are no longer common , yet the training has not changed significantly to recognize this new reality			2
automation used to be the pilot 's assistant			2
now the pilot is expected to back - up the automation			2
that is a fundamentally new task that the industry has n't trained for			0
regulators around the world need to acknowledge this and work to change the basic requirements in training programs			2
pilots need to know what it feels like to stall at high altitudes and train on how to recover			2
they need to know what to do when an airplane is suddenly handed to them during an abnormal flight situation by the autopilot turning off			2
they need to learn what to do and perhaps most importantly , what not to do in order to avoid increasing risk			0
some of this will require a renewed emphasis on manual flying skills , but new training will also have to be developed to address the fundamental new relationship that has developed between man and machine			2
there are a number of airlines around the work who are already changing their training standards to reflect this and we applaud this effort			0
all airlines should do this			0
they should not wait for their regulators to act			0
as with any tragedy , there will be a temptation to focus on blame and political posturing , but @entity77 is a case where politicians and judges should keep a respectful distance			1
there is some serious technical work to be done , and the aviation community needs to act quickly and objectively			0
it is a responsibility that the entire aviation community embraces and we are confident that the safety professionals will find solutions that ensure that tragedies like this do n't happen again			0
it is a debt we owe to those who have been lost			0
news : who 's really flying the plane ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity162 .			1

final report on crash of @entity77 concludes human error to blame
@entity77 crashed into the @entity169 en route from @entity171 to @entity172
@entity174 focused on pilots reactions to *instrument* failure , autopilot switching off
@entity162 : @entity178 is safest way to travel , but more must be done to *improve* pilot training
