-- there are slews of apps and websites to help you make the most of @entity7 and cyber monday , the two mondo - consumerist @entity10 holidays			0
but @entity11 , the out - of - nowhere social network that became wildly popular this year , may offer some of the freshest approaches to online gift - giving this season			1
" this holiday shopping season will mark a turning point for @entity11 , " @entity16 wrote on a @entity18 blog			1
" the social scrapbooking platform valued at $ 1.5 billion is n't making money itself yet			0
but it 's been helping retailers connect with customers since it launched a year and a half ago , and now it 's actively trying to help brands cash in			0
and this all - important shopping season companies are increasingly using it to drive online sales			1
" here are five ways you can pin yourself to a more productive ( and gift - filled ) holiday			0
( oh , and if you do n't know what @entity11 is , read this before proceeding			2
create a secret wish list : on november 8 , @entity11 updated its site to allow users to create up to three private pin boards			1
you could use one of these to pin images of products that you 'd like to receive during the holiday season , and then you could share that page with a couple of relatives			1
since posts on @entity11 link back to the website where you found the image you 're sharing , it makes it easy for @entity53 or @entity54 to find exactly the item you 're looking for			2
the downside : this exercise in " give me this ! " pinning could be a turn - off for family members who want to be more creative -- or for people who have only a vague idea of what gifts they would like to receive			0
" whatever you pin appears to refer to specific brands , colors , or size , even if that 's not what you intended , " writes @entity68 for @entity69 " @entity11 works wonderfully for sharing images of the exact tennis racquet you want , but is n't as good for convincing your family that any old tube socks will do			2
pin boards with gift ideas for others : if narcissism is n't your thing , you could use private @entity11 boards to make visual lists of the gifts you 'd like to buy for friends or family members			1
since @entity11 allows only three private boards per user , it might be smarter to make one board with gift ideas for everyone on your list			2
download a browser extension for @entity11 that lets you share a photo to your board in a couple clicks			1
" this is one time i wish @entity11 offered more than three boards , as having one for each person on your holiday list could be most useful , " writes @entity105 for the @entity106			1
" and if @entity113 uses @entity11 , this could change everything we know about making the list and checking it twice			2
" using @entity11 's mobile app , you could take these lists with you to the store			1
or , of course , you could go all cyber monday on it and buy the goods online			0
get " 30 days of @entity124 " : in a blog post on tuesday , @entity11 announced a guide to the holidays called " 30 days of @entity124 " ( not " perspiration , " but we know you were thinking it , too )			1
it works sort of like an online @entity131 calendar			0
over the next month , the company will unveil " a series of holiday boards from people , businesses , non-profit organizations , celebrities , and more , " it says			1
" from what to cook and how to decorate to ways to give back and health tips for the new year , there 's a little something for everyone			0
" day 1 : @entity146 traditions from @entity147			0
follow the project at this site : @entity150			0
follow tastemakers and stores : conveniently enough , @entity11 announced november 14 that it would allow business to create @entity11 pages			1
before that , the company 's terms of use prohibited a business to use the site for profit			0
the switch seems to be effective for websites			0
in a blog post , @entity11 said that @entity165 , a cooking site , saw 50,000 recipes and 139 mililon impressions in a three - month trial period			1
several retailers have set up @entity11 pages in time for the holidays			1
among them : gap , @entity174 , @entity175 's , @entity176 and @entity173			0
many of these pages highlight women 's apparel and accessories , which makes sense since most of @entity11 's users are female			2
but there are dude - specific boards too , including @entity186 and @entity187			0
the @entity189 and @entity190 , technology - focused websites , also have a robust set of gadget boards that may help you shop for that tech - head on your list			0
@entity196 on family members : finally , and maybe this is an obvious one , but if your family members are active on @entity11 ( or @entity201 or @entity202 ) , you could snoop through the products they 've posted about to get ideas for gifts that may be appropriate			2
if your loved ones are n't freaked out by this invasion of their public - private life , they may thank you for it later			0
