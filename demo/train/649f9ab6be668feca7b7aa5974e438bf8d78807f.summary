-- @entity2 shriveled to a tropical depression after hitting @entity4 on tuesday , but it still packed heavy rains that threatened to worsen flooding along the @entity7 and inland towns , forecasters reported			1
@entity10 lumbered onto the marshy west coast near @entity12 , about 160 miles north of @entity13 , on tuesday afternoon , the @entity9 announced			1
but it was projected to dump another 4 to 8 inches of precipitation across the area through wednesday evening , on top of the 2 feet reported in some towns south of @entity19 by tuesday			1
in addition , storm and tidal surges caused flooding as far south as the @entity16 , and it 's blamed for one death from a tornado spawned sunday afternoon in the town of @entity27 , far inland			1
as of 8 p.m. et , @entity10 had top winds of 35 mph			1
it was centered about 50 miles west of @entity31 , moving east - northeast at 6 mph and was n't expected to lose much strength as it crossed the @entity4 peninsula , forecasters said			1

@entity85 researcher @entity84 said the area 's low - lying terrain contributes to the misery			1
" the coastal gradient -- the rise of the land -- is very , very low here , " @entity84 said			1
" if you were to go swimming here and walk out from shore , you could walk out half a mile			0
" that means a relatively small storm surge can push water " tens or hundreds of feet onshore , " he said			1
" when you get a lot of rain , it tends to spread out , " said @entity84 , a geochemist			1
" so the rivers have large floodplains , and the water gets very wide when it gets wet like this			0
" storm surges along @entity41 were expected to run 2 to 4 feet , with 1 - to 3 - foot tidal flooding expected to the south , including @entity111 , the hurricane center said			1

" near @entity13 , wildlife officials assessed weather conditions so they could assist a manatee calf whose mother was found dead			0
residents tied the mother to a sea wall so the calf would n't leave its side			0
an adult male manatee was also staying with the mother and calf			0
the calf 's mother was moved , and officials discovered the calf was older than initially thought , so it was allowed to swim away into @entity111 , said @entity216 of the @entity217			0
