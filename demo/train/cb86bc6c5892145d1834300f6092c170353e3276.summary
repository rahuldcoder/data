@entity0 , @entity1 -- some protesters not satisfied with the @entity1 king 's proposed constitutional reforms have called for a peaceful demonstration sunday			1
" the national coordinators ( of the movement ) have called for a demonstration sunday for a truly democratic constitution and a parliamentary monarchy , " a member of the @entity9 wing said saturday			1
" the plan as proposed by the king yesterday , does not respond to our demands for a true separation of powers , " he said saturday			0
king @entity21 of @entity1 declared sweeping reforms that will boost the power of the prime minister and take away some of his own			1
@entity1 's revamped draft constitution will make officials more accountable , the parliament in @entity9 more dynamic and will give the government greater powers , the 47 - year - old king said in a nationally televised address			1
a @entity0 - based spokeswoman for the reform movement said " tomorrow there should n't be nationwide demonstrations as all @entity1 are happy with the king 's speech			1
" the movement has called for the creation of a parliamentary monarchy , an end to the influence of the king 's inner circle and for a crackdown on corrupt officials			2
@entity47 and @entity48 are examples of a parliamentary monarchy			0
in his 30 - minute speech friday , the sovereign described the draft constitution as " a bedrock of the special @entity1 democratic development model -- a new historical bond between the throne and the people , " while describing himself as a " citizen king			1
" his actions followed a series of unprecedented protests not seen before in this @entity67 modern @entity66 country , where street protests are normally tolerated by the state , unlike in most other @entity71 countries			0
if the draft is ratified in a referendum set for july 1 , its most radical change would be empowering voters to select a prime minister , thereby ending the longstanding practice in which the king has selected his own man for the job			1
the prime minister has tended to take his lead from the sovereign on key matters of state			0
if @entity1 back the draft , then the new prime minister would have new powers in decision - making and in day - to - day management -- relieving the king of a number of duties and aligning the style of management along the lines followed by some @entity99 countries			1
in an example of power sharing , the draft constitution empowers the prime minister to dissolve the @entity104 , and stresses that the king shall consult him before announcing the dissolution of parliament			2
" it specifies the conditions to be observed in each case in order to ensure the separation of powers as well as balance and cooperation between the branches , " the king said			0
friday 's speech stems from a process that was first announced in march , after widespread civil unrest in the wake of the revolutions in @entity123 and @entity124			0
the king instructed a hand - picked committee to consult with political parties , trade unions and civil society groups on constitutional changes with a brief to trim the monarch 's political powers and make the judiciary independent			1
but not all civil society groups were consulted , which sparked a wave of demonstrations across the kingdom from groups who feared they would be left out of the new plan			0
this move alone -- to grant real power to an elected prime minister -- could satisfy a number of demands from those members of society who have called for change			0
confirming the full authority of the head of government over cabinet members , the draft constitution gives the prime minister the power to propose and dismiss cabinet members			0
but @entity157 will remain a key power - broker in the security , military and religious fields , according to the draft			2
for example , the king would still serve as " the supreme commander of the armed forces " and would not relinquish the power to appoint ambassadors and diplomats under the new constitution			2
furthermore , the king would retain the power to dissolve parliament after consultations with the new constitutional court , half of whose members he would have appointed .			0

some protesters will *gather* sunday ; others *oppose* idea
@entity1 will vote for the constitution in a referendum *slated* for july 1
@entity157 's role would be that of " citizen king "
@entity157 says the constitution will guarantee independence of the judiciary
