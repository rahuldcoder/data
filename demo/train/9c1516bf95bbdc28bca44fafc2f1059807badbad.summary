-- the ability to live completely off the grid is now a reality courtesy of solar homes , known as @entity5			1
the u-shaped buildings utilize local resources such as the sun and are made entirely of natural and recycled materials			1
the future of city living may be to not need the city at all			2
" an @entity5 is the name we have given a building or vessel that we use to live on this planet that is absolutely independent of all public and municipal utilities , " explains @entity13 , founder of @entity5 , who developed the concept			1
in the mountains of @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity13 has built 15 cliff - top homes which , as well as providing a view , were designed to prove that the @entity5 could be built anywhere			1
at their core are walls made from old tires , bottles , and tin cans mixed with concrete , so your home leftovers are creating new homes			1
even sewage is n't spared and is used in indoor and outdoor treatment cells for food production and landscaping			0
leftover ' gray ' water is also used to flush toilets			0
" we were accused of running sewage through the living room , " says @entity13			0
" that was scary to people but when you see the pictures of what it looks like , it 's no longer scary if you understand it			0
" most modern amenities such as plumbing , heating , power and even internet are provided in a self - sufficient way to change the face of remote living			2
the use of a design known as the ' stack effect ' in their construction uses natural ventilation to regulate internal temperatures for comfort			0
" a lot of people think off - the - grid living is like living in some kind of teepee or something , " says @entity13			2
" this is a pretty damn nice house			0
" the @entity5 range in price from $ 250,000 to $ 1.5 million			1
but remote deserts are not the only modus operandi , as @entity13 ' company has also built 75 homes across the city of @entity84 , @entity22 and his designs have gone global			1
earthships have been built across the @entity23 , entered @entity87 , and relief projects are being developed in @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , and @entity95			2
@entity96 is taking place for a self - sustaining music school on @entity99 , one of the most remote locations in the world			0
but the spread of these ships has not been plain sailing , as their radical design breaks most architectural rules			0
@entity13 has battled with local governments about the @entity5 meeting structural codes			1
however , his fights are being won as hundreds of people now live , or use , these uniquely designed buildings around the world			2
the company 's next goal is to expand from remote living to more self - sufficient cities which would be more affordable and sustainable to build -- an @entity5 city			1
" if some government or corporation was getting ready to do a city for ten thousand people , they 'd spend ten years putting in infrastructure to support that city 's power and sewage , " concludes @entity13			0
" we do n't need that : if i had a thousand acres somewhere , and funding , i could start building a city tomorrow			0

earthships are self - sustainable buildings independent of all utilities
the first @entity5 were designed in @entity22 , in and near the city of @entity84
walls are made from recycled tires , tin cans and bottles
the price of each one ranges from $ 250,000 to $ 1.5 million
