-- the contents of your pocket gleam up at you from the @entity5 , @entity7 sidewalk like a sarcastic wink			1
you sit on the curb , surrounded by police cars , cuffs slicing your wrists , passersby whispering			1
you 've told the cops you 're an @entity15 agent			1
you 'd been debriefing your supervising officer two states away at the time they allege you committed the crime			1
they check your @entity22 what seems like a hundred times			1
they even look at it upside - down			2
yet here you are , still waiting on them to finish checking out your story			2
you are , of course , black			1
you 've heard folks say , " if black folks would just take responsibility , stop blaming slavery , maybe they would n't be getting arrested and killed in the numbers they are			1
" but how much more personal responsibility can you take ? you grew up without a dad and still became an undercover @entity15 agent			1
after the above incident , @entity40 , author of the upcoming " a survival guide : how not to get killed by the police , " went on to become a federal prosecutor , then in - house counsel for the @entity44 and @entity45			1
how much more responsibility could professor @entity47 have taken -- beyond becoming one of the world 's pre-eminent intellectuals -- that would have stopped officers arresting him at his own front door ? how much more responsibility could president @entity55 have taken -- beyond making history and achieving policy goals unrealized by his white predecessors -- that would stop some people from portraying him with a bone through his nose and calling him a terrorist ? where was @entity68 prosecutor @entity67 's personal responsibility to say , " call a prosecutor from the other side of the state to build the case against a local officer ? " where was the personal responsibility of officer @entity76 to stop choking @entity77 when he kept saying he could n't breathe ? why did he arrest him for the finable offense of selling loose cigarettes , or " loosies ? " it 's racism , whether we want to admit it as a society or not , that says : " it 's legal to kill unarmed black men			1
" the people marching are n't making it up			2
i know because i 'm married to a black man			1
a man , who numerous times , has had an officer 's gun on him , though he attended @entity98 and has never been accused of committing a crime			2
the impunity with which officers ( and even members of the neighborhood watch ) can brutalize and kill black people reeks of the past			1
i ca n't sleep thinking my mixed - race girls will grow up in a society that values their lives less than mine			2
still , i have friends and family who are officers			2
i see what they sacrifice to serve			2
i respect them and i need their protection			2
we have nowhere to go if each side paints the other with a broad and tainted brush			2
dialogue is the only way forward			2
so i spoke to @entity40 , as well as to a white officer , @entity122 , a high school classmate of mine who became an @entity125 officer in @entity126			2
@entity122 vouches convincingly for the vast majority of officers : " in the @entity130 , my lieutenant said to us : ' ten percent of you are born to be officers			2
for 80 % , this is a job			2
ten percent of you are criminals			0
' " @entity40 corroborates this : " ninety - nine - point - nine percent of cops are good			0
" he adds a caveat : " but there are bad cops , like in any other profession			0
you should be able to indict a bad officer			0
with video evidence , you ( should ) get an indictment probably 100 % of the time			0
" " i do n't think he meant to kill @entity77 , " @entity122 says			0
" guys say they ca n't breathe all the time , especially if there 's a crowd			0
" this difference in perception makes me curious : is there racial tension within the police force itself ? @entity122 states , " there 's no silent war between races on the job			1
" @entity40 parses the matter : a few minority officers " might put their heads in the sand , but from my experience , a vast majority understand the issues very well " and they 're very concerned			0
but minority officers have to approach these issues with " some sensitivity " for fear of being " accused of using the ' race card , ' " he said			0
@entity122 admits that occasionally , he would hear casual use of the word " animals			0
" he elaborates : " no matter where you work , you 're going to end up resenting that community because you play referee far more often than you end up playing police officer			1
" he adds : " there are criminal cops			0
i would n't hesitate to report them : cops who abuse , cops who steal and do drugs			0
but a cop who ends up spinning scenes up ? i might not want him at my crime scene ... but i 'm not going to ask him to be indicted			0
" but is n't it criminal to lose control to the point of killing an unarmed citizen ? not indicting officers who kill the civilians they 've vowed to protect sends a message that they 're above the law they 've sworn to enforce			1
to make matters worse , when black people protest injustice , they 're further vilified			1
the night of @entity67 's announcement of the @entity207 decision , @entity122 posted on @entity208 that @entity210 dispatch said a white male with a flag bandana had set fire to a police car			1
meanwhile , on the news , all i saw were images of black kids walking up to convenience stores with uncertain intent			1
@entity122 acknowledges that the white male could have set fires to frame black protestors			1
the point is , white people overwhelmingly get the benefit of the doubt from our society , while black people 's benefit to society gets doubted			1
when pressed if he thinks profiling exists , @entity122 replies , " if anything , it looks like white folks get the benefit of much more discretion			0
if you got locked up , you could have your parents call a high - powered attorney to get you out			0
... whereas if you 're locked up in the bullpen with a public defender , " it 's a diferent story			0
a racial double standard exists in policing practices			0
according to @entity250 , black men are 21 times more likely to be killed by police than white men			1
@entity253 must face how its own prejudices inform whom they perceive as criminals and whom as victims			0
@entity122 nails the heart of where white and black @entity261 diverge : " in these discussions we do n't have : ' if i stop a black guy on a drug block because i think he 's buying , and he was n't doing anything , it wounds his soul			1
' this is me doing my job			0
i do n't think about the impact because it 's not an impact i have to live with			0
" @entity40 admits that a certain amount of profiling is part of any police work , but holds firm that law enforcement leadership must do more to create an environment of sensitivity to -- and accountability for -- injustice			1
meanwhile , the wound to the man 's soul , we ignore at our peril			0
african - american culture disproportionately constitutes the soul of @entity261			0
in wounding the souls of black folk , we wound our own			1
if we do n't acknowledge those wounds , and officially atone for the crimes that caused them , we 'll keep killing for loosies and putting the victims on trial			0
note : an earlier version of this article gave an incorrect location for the incident described in the first paragraph			0
join us on @entity208 / @entity307 .			0

@entity309 : the responsibility for ending killings by police is *shared* by many
she says black males , even @entity15 agents , are often the target of *unfair* police actions
law enforcement must do more to *remedy* *inequities* and injustice , she says
