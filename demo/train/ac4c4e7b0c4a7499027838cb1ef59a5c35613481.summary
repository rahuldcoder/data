-- in a reversal of its past position , a majority of a 26 - person @entity3 advisory panel voted thursday to recommend looser restrictions on the controversial diabetes drug @entity9			1
thirteen members voted to modify the current restrictions , while another seven voted to remove them altogether			1
five members voted to continue the restrictions without changes , while one voted to remove @entity9 from the market			1
the decision whether to act on the recommendation now lies with @entity3 commissioner @entity18			2
in 2010 , the @entity3 restricted @entity9 use to patients with type 2 diabetes who could not control their illness with other medications			1
the decision was based on studies showing an increased risk of serious heart problems in patients taking @entity9 , most notably a 2007 analysis by dr. @entity30 , a cardiologist at the @entity31 , showing a 43 % increase in heart attacks			1
the finding led the @entity3 to order @entity37 ( @entity37 ) , the drug 's maker , to conduct a thorough study of its safety			0
the full results of that study -- known as @entity43 -- were made public in 2009			0
while @entity37 said the safety data was reassuring , the study was heavily criticized by dr. @entity46 , an @entity3 scientist who reviewed the data and said @entity37 ignored several cases of patients who suffered severe adverse effects			0
makers of diabetes drug will pay $ 90 million because there were multiple , conflicting signals of cardiovascular risk associated with the drug , dr. @entity57 , director of @entity59 , the @entity3 's @entity59 , recommended @entity37 commission an outside , independent group to review @entity43 's results			2
@entity37 chose the @entity64 ( @entity65 ) to re-examine the data			0
it was the results of the @entity65 review that prompted this latest two - day hearing			0
@entity65 's associate director , dr. @entity70 , said @entity65 performed a comprehensive review and its data was consistent with @entity37 's initial trial results			0
some members of the @entity3 panel questioned the severity of the current restrictions and the scope of cardiovascular events caused by taking the drug			2
" i am considerably reassured ... that the magnitude of risk is not great , " said dr. @entity81 , one of the panelists who voted to modify the warning			2
he added he thought the current warning was more severe than necessary , but should not be removed entirely			0
@entity37 said it will continue to work with the @entity3 as the panel 's recommendation is considered			0
" we continue to believe that @entity9 is a safe and effective treatment option for type 2 diabetes when used for the appropriate patient and in accordance with labeling , " said dr. @entity89 , @entity37 's chief medical officer			1
currently , only 3,000 patients in the @entity97 are registered to take @entity9 , according to @entity37 spokeswoman @entity98			1
that 's compared to the 120,000 patients taking the drug in 2010 before the restrictions were put in place			1
@entity0 's @entity104 contributed to this report .			0
