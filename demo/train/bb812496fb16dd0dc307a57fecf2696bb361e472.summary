@entity0 , @entity1 -- a long line of people winds outside the door at the @entity6 in @entity0 , but the near - sellout crowd is n't here for a new release			1
they are waiting to see " @entity11 , " a movie panned by critics when it was released in 2003			1
the majority of the people in line have seen it before , and will see it again			2
a few are wearing costumes , and more have brought along new friends and boxes of plastic spoons			2
everyone seems to have their own way of describing the film : " it 's so much more than a movie , it 's a social experience , " says @entity29 before her 18th theater viewing			1
@entity31 , a first - time viewer , was dragged to the movie by friends			1
" i 've heard that it 's the worst best movie ever , or the best worst movie ever , and that i should bring plastic spoons to throw at people			2
" whether it 's the best worst or the worst best , audiences have discovered a new cult classic movie			1
the story of " @entity11 " started with its premiere in @entity43 in 2003			1
there was some buzz about the film , helped by a large billboard on a main drag in @entity49			1
the director , producer and lead actor , all one man named @entity51 , arrived via limousine to a spotlight on a red carpet and signed autographs			1
the @entity49 treatment did n't last long			2
some in the audience walked out of the showing			2
critics were harsh , ripping every aspect of the film , from the overacting and confusing dialogue to the primitive cinematography			2
actress @entity68 recalls , " it was like trying not to laugh in church			2
" it was n't supposed to be like this for @entity51 , who poured his life and money into this passion project			1
but a select group saw a hidden brilliance in the unintentional comedy			0
one college kid named @entity80 sat and watched " @entity11 " alone in an empty theater and immediately called his friends to come to the next screening			1
more friends came to the next , and the next			0
the day after , 100 people were in the theater yelling out quotes along with the movie			0
after the disappointing initial two - week run in @entity43 , fans persuaded @entity51 to continue screening the film once a month			1
" it immediately struck a chord with the young , hip college crowd			0
" remembers @entity98 , who plays the character @entity99 in the film			2
" i showed up at a small screening and there was n't enough room , people were sitting on the floor			0
these kids knew every line			0
" the crowds grew , selling out theaters , and have continued since , once a month for the past seven years			0
shortly thereafter showings popped up in cities across the @entity112 , and then in the @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 and everywhere in between			0
the @entity117 in @entity43 now sells out all 5 cinemas the last saturday of every month for screenings of the " @entity11			1
" inside the theater in @entity0 , as the lights dim , there is an energy			0
as the film 's title displays , the audience erupts into cheers and applause			2
@entity129 continues throughout the entire 99 minute showing of this dark tale of infidelity			0
rarely a moment passes when there is n't a level of audience interaction : quoting the film aloud in unison and answering the characters ' dialogue with clever jokes			2
the most common ritual in theaters everywhere is the plastic spoons			0
in the titular room , where most of the drama takes place , there are several framed photographs of the cutlery item , and every time one appears on screen , audiences yell " spoons ! " while throwing hundreds of them in the air			0
director @entity51 is clearly the force behind this movie , with his hands on everything from writing the script to funding the production out of his own pocket			1
the heavily accented star also provides most of the humor in the highly quotable film , intentional or otherwise			2
he does n't mind , saying , " if you can laugh at my project , i did well			0
i put a little happiness in your life and that 's good			0
" while this is certainly a unique event , it 's not a completely new experience			0
" the @entity179 " has been combining cinema with audience participation since the ' 70 's			0
even @entity80 says he and his friends were intentionally attempting to make the experience like " @entity179			0
" but @entity51 does n't see the comparison			1
" you ca n't compare oranges to apple , or oranges to lemon			0
we 're dealing with relationships and betrayal			0
" after seven years , it appears the aura of " @entity11 " is still growing			1
when cast member @entity194 went to a screening , @entity193 came out of the audience and asked to take a picture with him			0
@entity51 has since made appearances on @entity199 and @entity200			1
but the self - made star is not forgetting the movie that fans will forever remember him for			2
" next year we put ' @entity11 ' on @entity205 , and i have great support			1
we will do ' @entity11 ' musical eventually			1
" there is a lot of mystery about @entity51 , who wo n't answer questions about his heritage or where he got his money			1
fans gather at q and a sessions trying to get every bit of information so often that @entity98 decided to publish a tell - all book about meeting @entity51 and the making of the film			1
amid the confusion , there are plenty of fans who do n't need an explanation			0
" i 'm not confused about ' @entity11 ' at all , i think it 's beautiful , " says @entity226			1
" the more that people allow ' @entity11 ' to be what it is ... i think the more enjoyment they 'll get			1
" @entity232 agrees , " ' @entity11 ' is probably the greatest movie i 've seen in my lifetime			1
" @entity51 says he is pleased with the way things have turned out , and he has few regrets			1
" everything turned out the way i wanted it			0
when you look at the content , i would n't do differently			0
if you look at technical , yes , maybe 20 % differently			0
