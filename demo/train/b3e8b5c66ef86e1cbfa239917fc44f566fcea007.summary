-- with about 2,400 four - year universities located in the @entity3 , high school students may find the actual process of applying to college as anxiety inducing as waiting for an acceptance letter			0
@entity8 wants to make selecting schools to send an application to easier			1
on tuesday , the company is launching a @entity13 app called @entity14 that shows prospective college students how likely it is that they will be admitted to each school on their lists			1
the app asks students for their basic information : test scores , address , and other factors that affect admissions , like whether they volunteer or play sports			2
it then uses an algorithm to give users a desirability rating as well as the likelihood , ranging from " very poor " to " very good , " of getting into the schools			0
admission splash currently runs customized equations for about 1,500 schools that it developed using the admission data they release			1
admissions offices often paint a picture of case - by - case application analysis that ca n't be narrowed down to an equation			0
" although high school grade point average and standardized test scores are important indicators of academic achievement used in @entity42 's admissions review , they only tell part of the story , " advertises @entity42 's prospective student website , for instance			0
but @entity14 's equation , which definitely does n't take essays into account , has been pretty accurate in tests that use publicly available admissions profiles			2
in the case of @entity42 , approximately 85 % of students the app said would get admitted actually did			1
the sample sizes of these tests are fairly small ( 73 people for the @entity42 test ) , so i would n't suggest posting @entity14 results on one 's facebook page before getting an acceptance letter			2
using the tool as a way to compare schools ' competitiveness or to share a list of prospective schools with friends , on the other hand , seems like a win			0
