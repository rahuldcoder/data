@entity1 , @entity0 -- a @entity0 legislative committee approved a measure thursday that would place broad new restrictions on abortions in the state , paving the way for the contentious legislation to become law			1
@entity12 @entity11 cleared the @entity13 on a 6 - 3 vote			1
the bill will move to the full @entity13 floor friday afternoon in the second attempt to pass the legislation in the @entity13			1
the bill originally failed to pass during the previous special session because of a filibuster from @entity22 sen. @entity21			1
@entity23 , the former @entity24 senator and presidential candidate , joined @entity0 lt. gov. @entity26 and @entity28 members of the @entity12 and @entity13 on thursday to voice support for the bill and disdain for @entity32 and those who would seek to block the legislation			1
at a news conference , he blamed the media for lionizing @entity32 and accused the senator of being out of the @entity24 mainstream			2
" look at what she was defending			0
she was saying that women should n't have sanitary conditions when receiving an abortion , she was defending that children who would otherwise be born alive should n't have the right to be born alive			2
" he went on to say , " this is an important moment for everyone to recognize where the abortion debate really is in @entity24			2
" for @entity23 and other stalwarts of the anti-abortion movement , what 's happening in @entity0 will reverberate around the country			0
the measure seeks to ban abortions past 20 weeks of gestation , mandate abortion clinics to become ambulatory surgical centers , tighten usage guidelines for the drug @entity60 and require doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic at which they 're providing abortion services			0
critics of the measure say it would shut down most abortion clinics in @entity0 -- denying access to many in rural communities -- and force women to seek dangerous back - alley abortions			0
the @entity28 legislators who support it say the bill is n't about banning abortions , but rather about protecting women 's health			1

however , pastor @entity91 , of @entity92 , who was asked to provide opening remarks for the news conference , offered a much more succinct end goal : " this is a small , important step toward @entity96 of abortion in @entity24			0
