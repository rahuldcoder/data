@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 still wears her faded yellow and green school dress , but she has n't been to school for years and she ca n't comprehend what to do with the pen the community nurse has just given her			1
" write on my hand , " says the nurse			2
@entity3 just sits on the reed mat , her legs pulled to one side , and stares			2
she has just had an attack and ca n't speak			2
she struggles to comprehend her surroundings			2
@entity3 , 13 , has been struck by the dreaded nodding disease			1
her mother , @entity20 , says it will take her at least four hours to recover from the seizures , and after each attack she seems less like the daughter she remembers			1
" her personality has changed greatly from before			2
she was normal when they were born			2
now she just moves around and serves no purpose , " @entity20 says			2
@entity3 , like more than 3,000 other children in @entity1 , has been struck by the mysterious syndrome that has doctors and scientists puzzled and has shattered lives in this rural community			1
nodding disease gets its name from the strange nodding - like symptoms that children display in the first stages of a seizure			1
but doctors on the ground and at the @entity44 - based @entity43 ( @entity43 ) say that is the least profound effect			2
severe epilepsy - like seizures grip the children , they struggle to eat , and they become shells of their former selves			1
it is a progressive and debilitating syndrome that robs children of their future			1
the seizures are triggered in strange ways , say community members , such as when unfamiliar food is brought to the children or when the weather changes			1
there are other bizarre symptoms			2
often the children will wander off by themselves and get lost in the bush			1
and other children will start fires , according to parents and medics in the field			1
others appear confused and traumatized			2
we were told that several houses in areas we visited had been burnt down by children suffering from nodding disease			1
more than 200 deaths have been reported from these ' secondary ' incidents			0
once , @entity3 vanished for five days			0
now , to protect her children @entity20 ties them up when she leaves			1
she pulls @entity80 and her brother , @entity81 , who also suffers from nodding disease , inside her hut and ties them with a colorful , local fabric			1
first , she ties their legs to a wooden pole and then their hands together like handcuffs			0
@entity81 tears at them with his teeth			0
" when i am going to the garden , i tie them with cloth			0
if i do n't tie them i come back and find that they have disappeared , " she says			0
@entity99 , @entity100 , and @entity101 have all suffered outbreaks of nodding disease over the years , but it first came to the attention of @entity106 authorities in 2009			1
a team from the @entity109 team visited the region of @entity111 and @entity112 and noticed a high incidence of the disturbing symptoms			0
" it was quite desperate , i can tell you , " says dr. @entity115 , the @entity109 representative in @entity1			1
" imagine being surrounded by 26 children and 12 of them showing signs of this			1
the attitude was to quickly find a solution to the problem			0
" @entity115 and the @entity106 government mobilized teams from @entity109 , @entity43 , and local health teams			0
right now there is no real solution			0
nodding disease leads to epilepsy like symptoms , says the @entity109 , but the cause is unknown and there is no cure			1
@entity109 officials say 93 percent of cases are found in areas also with the parasitic worm @entity140 , which causes river blindness and is carried by the @entity142			0
and many cases show a deficiency in @entity145			0
@entity146 also seems to play an important role			0
" at first we cast the net wide			0
we ruled out three dozen potential causes and we are working on a handful of probabilities , " says dr. @entity150 , director of global disease detection and emergency response at @entity43			1
while nodding disease has n't triggered the response that , say , an outbreak of @entity159 would , the @entity43 has conducted field investigations and extensive lab work , says @entity150			1
this outbreak in @entity1 is confined to the north and is not believed to be contagious , but from a public health standpoint it still has to be taken seriously			1
" we know from past experience an unknown disease could end up having more global implications , " says dr. @entity150			1
for @entity106 children in the region it is having massive implications			1
in the first three days of registering children at the @entity176 health center in @entity177 last week , more than 400 possible cases showed up			1
one extended family had seven children afflicted with @entity180 -- all of them severely stunted physically and mentally			1
nodding disease seems to only affect children between 1 to 19 years , with the worst affected at ages 3 to 11 , based on anecdotal evidence gathered by health workers			1
it is unclear how many fatalities have been caused by the disease itself , but its victims are left unable to function in any meaningful sense and profoundly dependent on others for care			1
and all this is in a region where many families suffered for decades from the brutality of the @entity199 , led by @entity200 , which abducted thousands of children and pushed civilians into mass camps			1
almost every household in @entity0 district seems to be affected			0
we follow the nurse into cluster of huts , where another child , @entity211 , has just passed out			0
he lies in a pool of his own urine , saliva pouring out of his mouth , still twitching from the last affects of a seizure			0
the nurse tries not to touch him and does n't want to take his pulse			0
there is just too much mystery surrounding the illness			0
" i feel , because i do n't know what causes it , i do n't even know how it transmits , when i touch them i feel that i can also get the infection because i do n't know what causes it , " says @entity225 , a local nursing officer			2
so @entity211 is left alone			0
only his mother , @entity233 , helps to clean him up with a bucket of water and waves away flies from his face			2
" i feel dark in my heart			1
this boy has become nothing , " she says			2
@entity211 can only move by dragging himself along the dirt , but she still ties him up when she leaves the homestead			0
in the household everyone and in the larger community setting the whole community is also suffering , trying to understand why them at this particular time , " says @entity245 , of the @entity106 @entity246			0
doctors are using drugs for controlling epilepsy with some limited success			0
but they say it only slows the progression of symptoms , rather than stops them			0
after months of delay , @entity1 did last week begin the drive to register cases			1
one health outpost in the @entity0 told @entity2 they had n't received anti-epilepsy drugs for four months and they had been forced to turn away desperate families			0
now the health center has received drugs , but they fear the high number of cases could overwhelm them			0
one local member of parliament was so desperate to get attention for the disease that in early march he transported 25 suspected cases by bus to @entity274 for treatment at the country 's main referral hospital			2
@entity1 's health ministry says they are doing enough			1
they say they have switched to a more effective epilepsy drug and they are training local health workers to deal with the disease			2
@entity115 says : " people complain that it looks like the lives in developing countries have less value than the lives in the western countries			0
when you know the root cause , you address the cure			0
now you are just relieving the symptoms			0
we do n't expect to cure anybody			0

more than 3,000 children suffer in outbreak of mysterious nodding disease in @entity1
one mother said : " i feel dark in my heart . *[* my *]* boy has become nothing "
disease debilitates its victims and some seem *compelled* to start fires , medics say
so far , no one knows the cause and no one can be cured
