private spaceflight company @entity0 scrubbed a scheduled rocket launch tuesday , in which it planned to attempt the pioneering step of landing the rocket 's first stage on a floating platform			1
the next possible launch attempt is at 5:09 a.m. et friday , @entity8 said via @entity10 , " pending resolution of the issue			1
" @entity8 and @entity0 said the problem was with the @entity16 rocket 's second stage , rather than the section it plans to try to land			1
" during the terminal count engineers observed drift on one of the two thrust vector actuators on the second stage that would likely have caused an automatic abort			1
engineers called a hold in order to take a closer look , " said @entity25 , of @entity0 communications			2
the thrust vector control actuators are used to steer the rocket in flight			1
the second stage of the rocket delivers the payload -- in this case , supplies for the @entity39 -- to the desired orbit			2
@entity0 's attempt to land the @entity16 rocket 's first stage has been the chief focus of interest ahead of its latest resupply mission			1
recycling rockets traditionally , rockets have been designed to fall back to @entity49 after separating from the spacecraft they lifted , and then burn up on re-entry or crash into the ocean			0
the millions of dollars that go into the production of the rockets burn , too			0
@entity0 wants to pioneer a reusable rocket , a development that could change the economics of space travel			1
" a fully and rapidly reusable rocket -- which has never been done before -- is the pivotal breakthrough needed to substantially reduce the cost of space access , " @entity0 said in a statement			1
the company has twice attempted soft landings of the @entity16 's first stage on water			1
those tests showed that the rocket is capable of reducing its speed from hypersonic to nearly zero , and deploy landing legs			0
in those tests , the rocket tipped sideways and crashed into the ocean , causing damage that made the rocket unusable			0
that was according to plan , @entity0 said			2
landing on a moving target when the launch happens , the company will try the same soft landing for the @entity16 's first stage , but this time on a custom - built floating platform it calls the autonomous spaceport drone ship			1
landing on the platform " is significantly more challenging " than the water landings , the company said			0
for one , the platform is not anchored , and while it looks large from the ground , it is a rather small target for the 14 - story - tall rocket			0
@entity0 described reentry and landing as " trying to balance a rubber broomstick on your hand in the middle of a wind storm			0
" the company puts the odds of success at 50 % at best			0
it adds , however , that this is just the first of a number of tests toward the goal of landing a rocket stage for reuse			0
as for the target , " x " marks the spot : the company will try to land the rocket stage on the @entity0 logo painted on the center of the floating platform			1
@entity121 , of @entity123 's @entity122 , told @entity1 the reason for using the platform -- despite the complications of landing on a moving target -- was that it should prevent any properties on @entity49 being damaged if the landing goes wrong			0
it 's not unusual for a launch to be aborted , he said , since there are so many elements at play			2
" the payload on this is so expensive to launch that you do n't want to risk anything about it , " he said			0
the timing of the next launch attempt will depend on how serious the problem is , he said			2
@entity1 's @entity144 contributed to this report .			0

problem is with a thrust vector actuator on the second stage , @entity0 says
@entity0 's scheduled launch tuesday is aborted ; next possible attempt is friday
in a first , the company plans to try to land the rocket 's first stage
