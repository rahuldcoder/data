@entity2 top congressional @entity1 leaders quickly criticized the @entity6 - @entity5 climate change pact to cut carbon emissions that president @entity8 announced while traveling in @entity9			1
senate minority leader @entity10 , house speaker @entity11 and sen. @entity12 , who is expected to chair the @entity14 , slammed the agreement in statements released shortly after the deal was announced wednesday			1
" our economy ca n't take the president 's ideological war on @entity25 that will increase the squeeze on middle - class families and struggling miners , " @entity18 , who hails from the coal state of @entity20 , said			1
" this unrealistic plan , that the president would dump on his successor , would ensure higher utility rates and far fewer jobs			0
" president @entity8 announced wednesday with @entity5 president @entity34 that the @entity6 will cut its 2005 level of carbon emissions by 26 - 28 % by 2025 while @entity5 committed to creating more energy from zero - emission sources and begin reducing its emissions footprint by 2030			1
@entity11 called the deal another example of @entity8 's " job - crushing policies			2
" " and it is the latest example of the president 's crusade against affordable , reliable energy that is already hurting jobs and squeezing middle - class families , " @entity11 said in a statement wednesday			2
@entity12 criticized the deal as unfair and knocked the @entity5 pledge to produce 20 % of its energy from zero - emission sources as " hollow and not believeable			1
" " the @entity6 will be required to more steeply reduce our carbon emissions while @entity5 wo n't have to reduce anything , " @entity12 said			1
@entity5 overtook the @entity6 within the last decade as the world 's top polluter following decades of the @entity6 as the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases			2

the two senators also made a pledge of their own , vowing to rein in regulations from the @entity69 , a common target for @entity1			0
@entity18 will take the helm of a freshly won @entity1 majority in the @entity14 in january			0
and while @entity18 and @entity8 have both vowed to try and work together , climate change regulation is likely to remain a contentious point with little common ground between @entity8 and @entity1 leaders			0
the agreement does not require congressional ratification , but a senior @entity8 administration official said " leading climate deniers " in the @entity1 could try and stop the initiative through legislation			2
" @entity85 may try to stop us , but we believe that with control of @entity85 changing hands we can proceed with the authority we already have , " the official said			0
the plan will also offer incentives in the @entity6 to build up solar and wind power			0
" consumers and businesses will save literally billions of dollars , " a senior administration official said			0
