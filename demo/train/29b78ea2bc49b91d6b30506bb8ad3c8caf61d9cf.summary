-- this @entity2 final looked to answer a question that has been surfacing throughout this tournament , and perhaps -- considering the hold @entity6 has had on @entity8 basketball fans in the past few weeks -- all of sports : is it the team , or is it the star ? the last game of this tournament pitted the best player in the world , @entity14 , against the best team in the world , @entity18			1
and if nothing else , this match demonstrated definitively that while players like @entity14 might win games , teams like @entity18 win titles			0
so @entity14 gets the @entity25			0
after steamrolling its way over @entity28 to make the final , @entity18 looked to be a favorite for the title despite its early draw with @entity33			2
for @entity35 , at stake was the lure of claiming the title on the home turf of its arch rival , @entity28 , which finished a devastatingly disappointing fourth after losing in saturday 's match against the @entity43			2
but the depth of @entity18 was too much for @entity35 in the end			0
while @entity47 -- who started the tournament with a hat trick against @entity50 and whose goal against @entity28 in the semifinal made him only the second player in history to score five goals in consecutive @entity56 -- has been one of the stars of these past weeks , it was an extra-time goal by @entity58 , who came off the bench , that propelled @entity18 to the top			0
so with play over for another four years , what have we learned ? sports matter : as we have seen time and time again with the @entity67 , politics do not cease to exist when players step onto the field , the court or the pitch			1
this tournament proved yet again what a critical window sport provides into the world we live in , particularly considering the fiery protests that greeted the @entity78 government when it signed on the dotted line to host			1
the billions spent on bringing the most - watched sporting event in the world to @entity28 put the country 's government into a fragile state as protestors told @entity86 to " @entity87			0
" but the politics were not reserved for the streets of @entity90 and @entity91 : inside the stadiums we saw fans in blackface when @entity18 faced @entity33 and a spike in the use of " @entity97 " on @entity98 when @entity18 faced both @entity28 and the @entity8			1
the @entity2 next goes to @entity100 , with @entity102 's @entity101 one of the venues			1
if the lead - up to the @entity105 are any indication , one has to wonder if @entity100 's next role as host to the world will renew cries against the country 's discriminatory policies against the lgbt community , its controversial annexation of @entity115 and claims last year by @entity118 star @entity117 that he had been abused by racist @entity120 fans during a @entity122 match			1
soccer remains the most popular sport in the world : to say the @entity2 is a global spectacle barely scratches the surface			1
the television viewing numbers for the group stages broke all sorts of records			0
while @entity8 pundits seemed stunned that 24.7 million people in the @entity8 watched their national team face @entity50 , the ratings in other countries during the group stages are almost incomprehensible			1
some 47.4 million people watched @entity28 face @entity139 , while in @entity141 34.1 million people watched their team take on @entity143			0
on @entity98 , @entity18 's smack down of @entity28 became the most conversed match ever , with 35.6 million tweets , dwarfing this year 's @entity148 numbers of 24.9 million			0
it 's time for @entity86 to get its own head in the game : sometimes the seemingly simplest sports can be the most dangerous			1
it is clear that @entity86 needs to learn the hard lesson of @entity155 and start paying attention to head injuries			0
it needs to think about changing its harsh substitution rules , which do not let a player return to the game once he sits and give a coach only three players off the bench per game			0
in the final , @entity18 's @entity167 took a nasty shot to the head when he collided with @entity35 's @entity171 in minute 17 , but after a moment on the sideline , he went back in for almost 15 more minutes before falling again and leaving the game , looking unquestionably dazed and confused			1
@entity167 's collision was one of many that this tournament saw			0
@entity35 's @entity179 cracked his head in the semifinal against the @entity43 and continued to play , while @entity183 's @entity182 went down unconscious after a knee to the head during his team 's first - round match against @entity188			2
like the others , he returned to the game after a brief checkup on the sideline and played for the remaining 30 minutes			0
@entity193 is experimenting with new substitution rules for players suspected of having concussions			0
calls for soccer to do the same will likely only intensify			0
bizarre moments at the @entity2 final the @entity8 maintains its love - hate relationship with soccer : yes , we know , thousands upon thousands of children hit the pitch every saturday morning , spring and fall ; and yes , we know , @entity207 is growing its attendance and cultivating its fan base ; and yes , we know , @entity210 is growing its ratings for the @entity213 telecasts			1
but will this translate to soccer breaking into the ranks that basketball , baseball , football and hockey enjoy ? to be sure , more than ever before , @entity8 fans got on the @entity2 wagon that somewhat shuts the rest of the world down every four years			1
@entity224 saw record - breaking numbers for @entity8 games during its excellent coverage of the tournament , and the @entity8 found a legitimate rock star player in @entity230 , making him a social media sensation after he stopped everything but a bus against @entity234			1
importantly , not all @entity8 fans stopped watching after the @entity8 had been eliminated			2
the @entity18 - @entity28 rollover nabbed some 6 million @entity8 viewers on a tuesday afternoon , making it the largest - rated non- @entity8 @entity2 game in history			1
that said , allegations that soccer is boring , " flopping " players are ridiculous ( that means you , @entity247 ) , the officiating ( especially the time keeping ) is confounding and that many fans are racist hooligans continue to be sermonized with passion and venom			2
in the @entity8 , then , there is only one thing we can count on in four years : there will be those who yet again claim that soccer has finally arrived and those who say that it has n't and never will			1
but perhaps we can answer the question sooner			0
tune in next year , when the @entity262 heads to @entity263			0
because on that pitch , the @entity8 will be a major factor , and there are few things @entity8 like more than being contenders			2
note : an earlier version of this article gave incorrect names for the opposing teams when @entity47 scored in the semifinal and when 24.7 million @entity8 watched .			2

is it the star or the team ? @entity279 says the @entity2 final went to the best team
she says *takeaways* *include* the role of sports as an *influence* on and window into politics
@entity279 says it 's time for soccer to take its dangers seriously
she says @entity2 showed enduring popularity of sport worldwide , gain in @entity8 interest
