-- bodies in the streets			0
bloody faces pleading for help			0
the horrific scenes and pleas coming out of @entity9 mount as activists claim president @entity12 's regime has been ratcheting up attacks , which the government denies			1
what 's behind the increase in violence , what effect did the @entity16 monitors have and what may the future bring ? @entity0 's @entity23 returned a few weeks ago from a rare look inside @entity9 , where the government has been placing restrictions on international journalists and refusing many of them entry at all			1
he explains what 's happening in this q&a transcript , edited for length and clarity			2
q : what is happening in @entity9 and why is it seemingly getting worse ? @entity23 : ( the violence ) is significantly worse			1
it 's become quantifiably worse since @entity12 unleashed the full force of his military army on @entity40 , on places like @entity42 that we visited with the @entity16 monitors			1
when the monitors were there , the army was n't shelling these towns			1
they were n't using tanks this way			2
they were n't firing mortars into these civilian areas			2
that 's begun in the last week or so , all these injuries			2
and when we were there , there were perhaps 20 or 30 people being killed a day			0
now the numbers are up in the hundreds			0
so it 's quantifiably worse			1
@entity12 has decided to ratchet up the firepower , to crush this uprising once and for all to break their spirit , to seal these areas off so they ca n't get in , so that they ca n't get medical supplies in , so that they ca n't bring weapons in to support themselves			1
q : are these reports from people and what you saw on the ground about hundreds of people being killed , are they accurate ? @entity23 : we 're not there and we ca n't verify the number of people that are being killed			1
what we see on the video that 's sent out from there , that seems to be shot on cell phones , is maimed people			2
... i 've been in this business for a long time , and it 's some of the worst i 've seen			2
there was a young child with everything below his nose missing , caught by a shell , children that are killed			0
there 's no doubt that there is shelling that is causing civilian casualties , that is damaging houses , that appears to be damaging hospitals , and we also understand , targeting the places where this video is being fed out of @entity40			2
it is a siege in the medieval sense of the word			0
q : has it come to a crisis point , or are they close to a crisis point where all hell breaks loose ? @entity23 : again , not being there , it 's very hard to gauge			1
but when you listen to the desperation in people 's voices , and you see the way that they 're talking and the terms they 're characterizing it in , yes , the situation is desperate			2
they say they 're running out of medical supplies			0
doctors are using secondhand sutures to stitch people up			0
they do n't have anesthetics to give to people			2
when you have these kind of wounds coming in -- the survival rate is negligible			0
the young man who lost his face , he died for lack of treatment , nothing else -- for lack of treatment			0
bread is in short supply			0
basic food things are in short supply			0
what @entity12 is trying to do is crush the will of the rebels , of the opposition here , so that they will give up , so that they have no other option			1
he 's also sort of trying to put the international community in a position whereby whatever the international community does through its desire to stop this ( crisis ) , it will perhaps play into his hands , the idea of humanitarian envoys			1
q : what about this notion that perhaps monitors on the ground or other people helping them out really plays into @entity12 's hands -- how so ? @entity23 : we 've already seen it			1
the monitors were on the ground before , monitoring what was supposedly @entity12 pulling his troops and his heavy armor back			1
their report at the end of a month said that he had n't complied			2
these monitors do n't have weapons			1
they have flak jackets , helmets and armored cars , some of them			0
they have no way of imposing their will , if you like , on @entity12 's forces			1
they ca n't stop them shooting			1
the notion that they could sort of get in between the opposition , these enclaves , and save them from the tank fire is a preposterous proposition			0
the only reason it would stop would be because @entity12 decided to tell his army to stop firing and stop shooting			1
and he appears to be nowhere near that kind of decision			0
... if anyone thinks that @entity16 monitors backed with some semblance of @entity211 training can go in and stop the kind of artillery fire and gunfire that 's going on , then think again			1
because there were monitors there who would n't even cross police road checkpoints , never mind go into contested areas			1
there were some monitors who were willing to do that , but they 're not set up and protected and equipped to go in and stop tanks firing and stop two forces shooting at each other			1
q : so why are we even talking about this then ? @entity23 : one of the reasons we 're talking about this is because @entity12 , backed by @entity231 , created a scenario on the ground where the @entity234 is watching huge , horrible humanitarian suffering			1
we 're the ones that are saying : what can we do to help ? how can we stop this ? @entity231 and @entity12 would like nothing better than to see us divided , see the international community brought to a position where they will compromise for something less , i.e. , not a removal of @entity12 , i.e. , not going in with a military intervention			1
maybe just protecting the people , saving the people			0
that 's what they 're aiming for in the short term right now			2
q : you were recently in @entity253			2
how strong of support does the regime have in the capital city ? @entity23 : about 20 to 30 % of the population supports @entity12			1
there 's 10 % @entity259 -- this is the sect that @entity12 is from -- ( and ) about 10 % @entity262			1
and the message that @entity12 sells his people is that , you 're only going to be safe under me			1
the @entity271 majority , if they get power , you will be forced out of your homes and businesses			0
q : we saw what happened in @entity277			0
do you think that 's ultimately going to happen in @entity9 ? @entity23 : we 're a long way from that			1
@entity281 still has 20 to 30 % support of the population			0
they still buy his message that he is fighting terrorist groups who are backed by an international media conspiracy			0
he has the support of @entity231 right behind him			0
there 's no strong @entity211 resolution against him			0
and he is a smarter guy with a stronger army that has n't given up on him yet			1
and the rebels there , the opposition , do n't have what the @entity297 , the east of the country , a huge base where they can operate from			0
they have tiny little enclaves that we 're seeing being shelled right now			0
@entity40 and places like that			0
it 's not that we have n't seen this type of thing before			2
if you think back to @entity309 , when @entity231 was supporting the @entity310 there , politically , not militarily on the ground , there were tiny little enclaves , the infamous @entity313			0
the @entity310 , after three years of standing back and shelling it , after the @entity211 -- we 're talking here about @entity16 monitors , where the @entity211 provided safety and security in @entity313 -- the @entity310 still went in and massacred 7,000 people			0
so what @entity12 and @entity231 are looking at here is a scenario where the international community could settle for something less , i.e. , trying to protect these areas			2
and that will be no protection .			0

@entity0 's @entity23 recently returned from a rare look inside @entity9
he says violence in @entity9 is significantly worse since full force of army unleashed
president @entity12 has decided to crush uprising once and for all , @entity23 says
he says outside monitors ca n't stop violence ; their presence could play into @entity12 's hands
