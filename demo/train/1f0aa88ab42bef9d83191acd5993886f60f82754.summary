@entity2 , @entity3 -- " the great question that has never been answered and which i have not yet been able to answer , despite my 30 years of research into the feminine soul , is , ' what does a woman want ? ' " this was @entity12 's response in 1925 to a female protégé , @entity13 , who sought his guidance			1
@entity13 , then in her early 40s , suffered in her own words , from " frigidity			2
" his question is alive today : last week , a @entity20 panel reviewed the efficacy and safety of a new drug to treat hypoactive sexual desire disorder -- lack of sexual desire			1
( the panel did not recommend approval			0
) i 'll come back to this in a minute			0
why does @entity12 's question persist ? well , one reason may have to do with who is asking the question , when , and why			1
in the early decades of the 20th century , for example , a @entity37 , @entity36 - based gynecologist named @entity39 was preoccupied with what made women unhappy in their marriages			1
so many had complained to him that they did n't enjoy sex			2
this prompted the doctor , an early advocate of birth control devices and a passionate promoter of women 's sexual pleasure , to conduct research -- loosely defined -- on some of his thousands of female patients			1
he studied their bodies and sketched their contours , looking for clues to their sensitivities and habits			1
female genitals were texts for the doctor to read			1
but so were the tales of erotic misery -- or just plain indifference -- that his patients would tell him			2
the doctor compiled his years of clinical observation in two weighty tomes , " a @entity70 " ( 1931 ) and " the @entity71 " ( 1934 )			2
@entity39 had a hunch that the growing presence of lesbians in @entity36 and other cities was a symptom of a larger problem with heterosexuality			0
women were turning to each other for sexual relations because men were bad lovers			1
egads ! maybe the answer to the nagging question could be answered only by women			1
@entity39 thereafter proposed to write a book he never published -- one that would be addressed to men , husbands in particular , to teach them how to give pleasure to women			1
waves of research on female sexual response followed throughout the 20th century , a time when western society attempted to regulate pleasure by studying it in metric forms and through tortuous interviews and searching questionnaires			1
" what 's wrong with me ? " became a commonplace			0
and through this complex process , lacking desire has become , in many ways , regarded as just as dangerous as having too much desire -- maybe even more so , actually			0
here we must turn to money and to the current news of the @entity20 panel 's hearings last week to decide whether to approve the new pharmaceutical pill flibanserin			0
the drug joins a plethora of pleasure - enhancing drugs and devices that in one way or another are premised upon variations of @entity12 's nagging question			1
developed by the @entity126 drug company @entity125 , the " little pink pill " ( " little blue " @entity130 's sister ? ) is meant to treat hypoactive sexual desire disorder			1
how ? by increasing levels of dopamine and norepinephrine ( libido boosters ) and decreasing seratonin ( libido downers ) in the brains of its sufferers			0
if the drug were approved , the @entity141 reported , annual sales might reach $ 2 billion in the @entity144 alone			0
@entity125 had run a marketing campaign that consisted mainly of convincing women of a certain age and wealth strata that they lack sufficient sexual desire and that they deserve a remedy			0
in a market - driven society , convincing people that they lack something they need is what advertising is all about			0
" do i lack sexual desire ? " if you answer yes to this question -- and @entity125 reports that 1,323 premenopausal women they studied did -- you become a member of the target market for flibanserin			1
the company 's success or failure in the marketplace rests in large part on women realizing they do n't have enough mojo			1
the company limited its subject sample to women living in the @entity144 and @entity175 who were otherwise healthy , well - educated and mostly married -- " normal " but for their deficiency of desire			1
studied in a double - blind trial over 24 months , women taking the pill reported that " sexually satisfying events " increased to about 4.5 a month , while those taking a placebo reported about 3.7 such events			2
incidentally , according to the framework of the study , these events need not include orgasm			0
q : what does a woman want ? a : @entity192			0
things just got so much easier ! or did they ? for starters , " hypoactive sexual desire disorder " rests upon such vague criteria that the @entity197 plans to remove it from the next edition of its authoritative diagnostic manual and replace it with " desire - arousal disorder			0
" and , even if we grant its existence , studies that estimate at least 10 percent of @entity144 women suffer from @entity209 were paid for by drug companies , the @entity141 says			2
@entity125 offers online medical education courses for health practitioners to get them involved in diagnosing @entity209			0
doctors taking the courses are quizzed on how to diagnose the condition of various kinds of women			0
in one exercise , the test - taker is asked to figure out what is wrong with a 42 - year - old working woman who cares for three children and an ailing mother , and lacks sexual desire			0
her husband is a very minor character in the test 's scenario			0
dr. @entity39 may be spinning in his grave now			0
psychologist @entity235 , who testified before the @entity20 panel friday , put it well when she remarked that if the drug had been approved , it would have given women the false impression that they can take a pill to get " the sex life they read about , the one they think everyone else is having			1
" one is tempted to ask whether the alleged upward trend in cases of @entity209 in women can be correlated to the " little blue pill 's " market debut in 1998			0
with all the talk of erectile dysfunction in men , maybe what women want now , sexually speaking , is a little less pressure to perform through pharmaceutically prolonged sexual encounters and a little more emotional support for their efforts , in and out of the bedroom			2
so what 's next now that the @entity20 panel said no to flibanserin ? an online course for male partners to teach them how to make love to women diagnosed with @entity209 ? that would be a start , but my guess is that what women want , particularly those who have come of age in an era of abstinence - only education , is knowledge about their bodies ( for themselves and their partners ) and respect for how their bodies work			1
such knowledge may help them / us question whether a daily dose of yet another " brain drug " will give us what we have come to suspect we need			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity290 .			2

@entity290 : @entity12 asked what women wanted ; " female @entity130 " raises question again
early 20th century doctor studied women , concluded men needed sex training , she says
drug company can profit from women worried they have sex problem , she says
@entity306 : women want better understanding of their bodies -- for themselves , partners
