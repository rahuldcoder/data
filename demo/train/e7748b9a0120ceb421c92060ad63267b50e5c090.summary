-- @entity2 's two - round demolition of @entity3 has set up the prospect of the biggest money - spinning fight in the history of boxing			1
@entity2 lands a solid right to @entity3 on his way to a comprehensive victory			1
the @entity11 knocked out the plucky but outclassed @entity13 in @entity14 on saturday night -- earning him by a conservative estimate at least $ 2 million dollars per minute			1
@entity3 , who could well now hang up his gloves , will pocket more than $ 8 million as a consolation			0
@entity2 's all - action style is popular with boxing followers and in his native @entity11 the theaters which screened his fight live with @entity3 were sold out well in advance with a ferocious demand for tickets			1
but the really big money lies in the @entity26 ( @entity26 ) revenues generated by the @entity28 @entity27 ( @entity27 ) network			1
@entity30 reported monday that early indications from cable companies were that the scheduled 12 - round light - welterweight bout could get as many as two million buys			0
co-promoter @entity35 was delighted with the figures especially as initial estimates were suggesting about one million boxing fans would shell out their cash			0
" we know based on those early numbers and based on experience the event will perform extremely well			0
if i had to guess , anywhere between 1.6 million and two million homes , which is a home run , " he said			0
the record for a ppv event is the 2.4 million buys for ' @entity52 ' @entity51 's may 2007 fight with @entity53 , which generated a staggering $ 134 million in revenue			0
@entity53 , who also beat @entity3 in another ' superfight ' at the back end of 2007 , astutely chose saturday night in @entity14 to announce he was coming out of retirement			1
@entity53 , nicknamed ' money ' because of the enormous revenues he generates , will face @entity62 's @entity61 on july 18 in his return to the ring			0
but the talk of the boxing world is an eventual match up against @entity2 with the notional pound for pound title at stake as well as a massive pay day			2
" if @entity53 wants a piece of the ' little @entity11 ' , just be my guest , " @entity35 said before the dust had barely settled on the @entity3 fight			1
with the flamboyant @entity51 retired after being handed a painful beating by @entity2 at the back end of 2008 , the mantle of @entity26 king is set to fall to one of the two men who ended his ring career			1
despite the global recession , the appetite for top prize fighting remains strong , but it is the more flamboyant characters who draw the biggest audiences			0
last november 's @entity27 clash between former pound for pound champion @entity89 and the brilliant undefeated @entity91 world champion @entity90 drew less than 250,000 buys			0
the only potential obstacle to a @entity2 - @entity53 bout , the dangerous @entity61 aside , is the relative sizes of the two men			2
@entity53 is a natural welterweight and would want a fight at 147 pounds , with @entity2 , who started his remarkable career at light - flyweight , wanting the match at a lower weight			2
but big business and money is set to talk and many predict the showdown will come late this year , almost certainly in @entity14 .			2
