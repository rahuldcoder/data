@entity0 , @entity1 -- terrorism , a slow economy and rising gas prices are issues that can keep @entity8 voters awake at night			2
undecided voters gathered at @entity10 , where dr. @entity11 studies how brains react to messages			1
political strategists know that the most successful candidates are masters at capitalizing on fears such as these , and that can make a huge difference at the polls			2
in 1964 , @entity21 was running for president against conservative @entity23 when his campaign unleashed the " daisy ad			0
" it showed a little girl counting as she plucked a daisy , charmingly mixing up her numbers			0
then a baritone voice takes over , counting down to an overwhelming nuclear explosion			0
it 's followed with a warning that the stakes are too high not to vote for @entity21			0
the ad , which ran only once , was so chilling and effective , analysts say , it helped @entity21 win the presidency by one of the widest margins in @entity8 history			0
@entity2 recently gathered eight undecided voters to see how they would respond to attack ads and how the ads might affect their choices			1
they met at @entity10 in @entity0 , @entity1 , where psychologist @entity11 studies how brains react to candidates ' messages			1
@entity11 , who wrote " @entity49 , " said fear - based attack ads are effective because they tap into a voter 's subconscious			1
" those kinds of gut - level reactions tell us things like , ' i do n't feel like this person is telling us the truth , ' " @entity11 said			1
" unless someone is a really good con man , those reactions are extremely helpful			0
the conscious brain processes only a tiny percent of information			0
" @entity11 and his business partner , @entity64 , have created software , through their company @entity66 , that looks into a voter 's subconscious			1
the software does this by measuring people 's reaction time to certain words after they watch attack ads. the undecided voters in @entity2 's group watched the ads and were then asked to identify the color of words such as " weak , " " inexperienced " and " terrorist			1
" if they hesitated , even for one - thousandth of a second , before they clicked on the color that corresponded with the word , @entity64 said , it meant the word had an impact			1
" if the word is on their mind , if the word was activated , it will slow them down , " @entity64 said			0
@entity11 predicted that the undecided voters would say they did n't like the ads and that the ads had no impact on them			1
the group watched @entity101 's " 3 a.m. " campaign ad , which was intended to make voters question @entity104 's experience			2
viewers said that the ad was fear - mongering and that it did not make them think @entity107 was a stronger leader than @entity104			1
but the data , @entity11 said , showed that their brains reacted differently			1
voters had the greatest hesitation with words like " weak " and " lightweight " during the color test			0
@entity11 said this meant the ad made them question @entity104 's readiness			2
" the purpose , too , is to make him seem scary , dangerous			0
' you need to be afraid of this guy as president , ' " @entity11 said			2
" that message unconsciously got through			0
" the undecided voters also watched an ad attacking @entity126 for saying the @entity8 could be in @entity127 for the next 100 years			1
after watching the ad , the group gave it a thumbs - down			0
but researchers said the data showed that it left them feeling @entity126 has poor judgment and is too close to president @entity134			0
the results were identical when the same test was given to a much larger group of 100 voters			0
this happens because the ads trigger a response in the part of the brain called the amygdala , which experiences emotions such as fear			2
when it is aroused , it overrides logic , according to @entity11			2
despite the ability of attack ads to affect voters ' subconscious thinking , @entity11 cautions that fear - based ads are risky because they can backfire			1
what advice does @entity11 have for presidential hopefuls ? " they should make voters feel inspired by them and worried about their opponent at the same time , " @entity11 said			1

fear - based attack ads are sometimes used by candidates to influence voters
@entity2 gathered eight undecided voters to measure the impact of attack ads
psychologist @entity11 says fear - based ads appeal to voters ' subconscious
