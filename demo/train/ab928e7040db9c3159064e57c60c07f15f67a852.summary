@entity0 -- he steered @entity3 through the perils of @entity5 and is recognized as one of the most important statesmen of the 20th century			1
but away from the world of politics , @entity8 was also an avid painter , drawn to scenes of stately homes in the @entity13 , picturesque fields in @entity15 and vibrant @entity17 landscapes			1
though he always saw himself as an amateur , he was quick to spot talent in others			0
now , for the first time , paintings of @entity22 in @entity17 by @entity8 are being shown alongside those of @entity17 artist @entity25 , who throughout his life credited @entity8 with convincing his father -- the @entity27 -- to let him pursue his dream of becoming a painter			1
" @entity34 of @entity22 was quite a fearful character and had great influence politically and great wealth , and the idea that his son was going to be a painter clearly would n't have come naturally to him , " said @entity30 , curator of the exhibition " meetings in @entity22 " at @entity33 in @entity0			1
in 1943 , the @entity27 showed the visiting @entity8 some paintings by his son and asked for his opinion			2
@entity8 approved and the young @entity25 was subsequently allowed to train as a painter in @entity43			2
" there were n't many people that the @entity27 would listen to but if @entity8 said it was alright to be painter , he could accommodate that desire , " said @entity30			0
@entity50 's career took off and he has since exhibited his work in @entity52 and the @entity53 , as well as in @entity17			2
at a sale at @entity57 's auction house in @entity43 in 2007 , a painting by @entity50 sold for 42,000 euros ( $ 54,000 )			1
though @entity50 was never able to meet and thank @entity8 , the exhibition at @entity33 -- which was first proposed by the artist 's daughter -- is a belated meeting between the two painters			1
@entity8 's granddaughter @entity63 , who helped organize the show , had been unaware of the role her father played in @entity50 's artistic career , but said that she was " enchanted to hear it			2
" after all , @entity8 had great affection for @entity17 , she said , and his only painting during @entity5 was a view of @entity22 , which he painted following the @entity72 in 1943			1
after the conference , @entity8 insisted that president @entity74 make the trip to @entity22 to see the view from a tower on the edge of the city			1
after @entity74 left , @entity8 painted the same scene and later presented it to him as a gift			0
" painting was very important indeed [ to @entity8 ] , it was what you would nowadays call a stress - buster , " said @entity63			2
" it was the thing he loved to do more than anything			0
" paintings by @entity8 now command high figures -- a painting of his home , @entity93 , sold for Â £ 1 million ( $ 1.5 million ) at an auction at @entity96 's auction house in @entity0 in 2007 -- but when he first picked up a brush he was 40 years old and at a low point in his life			1
it was in 1915 , during @entity101 , according to @entity30 , and @entity8 had just resigned as @entity102 following the disastrous campaign in the @entity104			0
" someone suggested that he take up painting and he had a go with his children 's watercolors , " @entity30 said			0
" the he tried in oils and he just became hooked on painting and it became his principle form of relaxing , " he continued			0
@entity30 admitted that it can be difficult to separate the paintings from the man who created them			0
but he said , " it 's striking just from hanging the exhibition how well his paintings stand up			0
" " [ the work ] does deserve to be taken seriously and not solely because it 's the product of this great statesman , " he continued			0
" meetings in @entity22 : the @entity123 and @entity8 " is on at @entity33 , @entity0 , until march 31 , 2012 .			1
