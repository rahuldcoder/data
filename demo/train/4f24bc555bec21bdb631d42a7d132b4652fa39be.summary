-- out of all the case files made public by the @entity3 online , the most popular is a memo from 1950 titled " @entity5 , " the agency said this week			1
the mysterious report from @entity7 , special agent in charge in @entity10 , begins with this : " an investigator for the @entity13 stated that three so - called flying saucers had been recovered in @entity15			1
they were described as being circular in shape with raised centers , approximately 50 feet in diameter			0
each one was occupied by three bodies of human shape but only 3 feet tall			0
" the name of the source is blacked out			0
so did the bureau take it seriously ? " it certainly looks like , they thought this was third - hand information , " said @entity3 historian @entity27			1
either it was the result of a hoax , he said , or " someone was simply reporting hearsay			0
" still , over a million people have looked at the sensational memo online			1
the account goes on to say that the bodies were " dressed in metallic cloth of a very fine texture			1
each body was bandaged in a manner similar to the blackout suits used by speed fliers and test pilots			0
" the memo also relays a potential explanation for why the flying saucers were found in @entity15			1
" the government has a very high - powered radar set up in that area , " the allegation says , " and it is believed the radar interferes with the controlling mechanism of the saucers			2
" the @entity3 took no further action on the case			2
although the file was first released in the 1970s , it was posted online in 2011 as part of the vault , unleashing a flood of tabloid headlines about little green men			0
in an article headlined " ' aliens exist ' say real - life @entity74 , " the @entity67 tabloid @entity66 said the memo appeared to back the claim that extraterrestrials landed in @entity72 , @entity15			2
but in a new commentary posted this week , the @entity3 said that since this memo was dated three years after the supposed @entity72 landing , " there is no reason to believe the two are connected			2
" the memo is part of a cache of hundreds of pages of accounts under the heading " @entity87 , " describing claims of @entity90 sightings , spacecraft debris and alien landings			0
also posted in the vault are hundreds of files on some of the @entity3 's most storied criminal cases such as @entity96 and @entity97 and @entity98			1
it also includes entertainers : @entity101 and @entity102 and @entity103			1
many of the files chronicle cases in which agents used painstaking methodologies and high - risk raids to solve crimes and capture dangerous fugitives			0
by comparison , @entity27 says , " the descriptions here of you know , 50 - foot diameter saucers and human - shaped three - foot tall metallic - clothed aliens -- that 's unique			2
" @entity0 's @entity120 contributed to this report			0
