" i have made a lot of mistakes falling in love , and regretted most of them , but never the potatoes that went with them , " wrote @entity5 in @entity6			2
if only most of us were so philosophical about the way we eat when we 're in the throes of a powerful emotion			2
unfortunately , after we celebrate our promotion with champagne and cupcakes or drown our romantic woes in a bowl of spaghetti , we tend to feel remorseful			1
" i indulged myself , " we might confess , in a hushed tone , to a friend the next day			2
( even our choice of word — indulge — is loaded , as it implies we are engaging in a vaguely illicit behavior			2
) but is this self - flagellation really necessary ? some experts say no. " it 's healthy to emotionally eat once in a while — to eat for comfort , to celebrate , or just because , " says @entity29 , a psychotherapist affiliated with @entity30 and the author of " the @entity32			2
" " sure , you could go for a walk or head to the gym , but sometimes an ice cream sundae is just the thing			2
" of course , no one is suggesting that it 's a good idea to routinely pull a @entity41 on a gallon of rocky road			2
frequent , heavy emotional eating can be a serious issue			1
however , doing it occasionally might not be all bad			2
both your body and psyche are hardwired to make connections between how you feel and what 's on your plate			1
it 's the way you handle — and regulate — your eating that makes the difference between a pleasurable endeavor and a real health concern			1
@entity57 : debunking health myths your physical cravings , @entity60 body is no dummy			2
there 's a reason it yearns for a bowl of crunchy - top macaroni and cheese or a sliver of warm apple pie			2
" foods that are laden with carbohydrates , sugar , or fat simply taste delicious , " says @entity71 , @entity72 , an associate professor of exercise psychology at the @entity74 , in @entity75			1
but surprise ! flavor is only part of the reason you crave these foods			1
your brain chemistry actually changes when you bite into a bagel or a @entity88			2
" carbohydrates set off a series of chemical reactions that ultimately lead to a boost in brain serotonin , " says @entity89 , @entity72 , the former director of the @entity90 in @entity91 at the @entity92			1
the higher the levels of serotonin , the more content you feel ( at least temporarily )			1
no wonder cutting out carbs can make you grumpy : a 2009 study from the @entity105 , in @entity106 , @entity107 , found that low - carbohydrate dieters registered the lowest moods			1
the same goes for fatty foods			1
in a 2011 study published in the @entity113 , subjects were fed through a stomach tube with either a solution of fatty acids or saline			0
both groups then listened to music proven to evoke a negative or neutral emotion			0
those given the fat were less sad , and brain scans showed dampened activity in areas associated with sadness			1
the researchers believe this shows that fatty acids can induce a signal from your gut to your brain , which may influence emotions			0
there are times when we are more physically vulnerable to these triggers — for example , during periods of stress			0
" chronic stress creates elevated levels of the hormone cortisol , " says @entity142 , @entity143 , a family practitioner in @entity144 and the author of @entity146 , @entity150 ( $ 26 , @entity151 )			0
your body thinks you 're going through a famine , he explains , which can increase your cravings			0
exhaustion is a contributing factor , too			0
in a 2012 study , @entity158 and @entity159 's -- @entity162 researchers found that when subjects were sleep - deprived , seeing pictures of unhealthy foods activated reward centers in their brains			1
those centers were less active when the participants were fully rested			0
increased reward - center activity may make a person more likely to eat			1
( see , that 's why you scarfed those doughnut holes while pulling an all - nighter for work			0
) @entity177 ( and tasty ) snacks the quest for @entity180 is n't the only reason we eat emotionally			0
think back : since day one , when we were fed in a mother 's or father 's arms , we have associated food with comfort , says @entity188 , @entity143 , the founder of the @entity189 ? @entity191 , in @entity192 , and the author of @entity190 ( $ 20 , @entity151 )			0
as a child , you probably got the food - as - soother message in countless other ways , too : remember the lollipop the doctor always handed out after a visit ? the teacher who rewarded a students with ice cream ? by adulthood that association becomes ingrained in our minds , says @entity208 , @entity72 , a psychologist specializing in eating disorders and the chief clinical officer of the @entity211 , in @entity212 : " children 's brains sometimes are n't developed enough to use words to deal with complex feelings , so they may use food to self - regulate emotions			1
" that 's even more likely if your parents modeled that behavior			0
in a 2010 study published in the @entity224 , researchers brought together mother - preschooler pairs			0
they asked the moms to rate their own emotional - eating habits			1
then they devised an activity during which snacks would be offered to the children			0
the preschoolers whose moms reported regulating their feelings with food ate more snacks than did the other children			0
we 're also more likely to indulge ( there 's that word again ) when we 're trying to bond with others			0
a 2001 study from @entity243 , in @entity241 , showed that people consume more in a group than they do alone , regardless of hunger levels			1
eating socially " may help you feel like you 're strengthening relationships , " says @entity247 , a clinical psychologist in @entity144 and the author of @entity249 ( $ 18 , @entity151 )			1
why ? in that moment , united by a mutual desire to , say , conquer a piece of peanut butter pie , " everyone feels connected to one another			0
" @entity57 : 25 easy instant energy boosters when it 's a @entity259 you 're unsure whether your emotional eating has gone too far , ask yourself these questions			1
do you frequently eat when you feel emotional but not particularly hungry ? " when a desire or a craving comes from something other than hunger , eating ca n't satisfy it , " says may			1
" if you are eating but do n't physically need the food , you 'll never feel satisfied			1
" in fact , research published in the journal @entity272 in 2007 found that dieters who ate according to internal emotional cues , such as loneliness , instead of physical or external cues lost less weight over time and were more likely to gain it back			1
instead of confronting a problem , do you hit the refrigerator ? psychologists say that numbing yourself with food rather than dealing with your feelings can increase stress , which in turn can raise your blood pressure and weaken your immune system			0
do you punish yourself after having a treat ? guilt can lead to uncontrolled eating , says @entity293 , a @entity294 - based registered dietitian and the author of @entity296 to the @entity297 ( $ 35 , @entity151 ) : " if you feel bad about eating a scoop of ice cream , excess guilt may lead you to eat the whole carton			1
now you 've destroyed any pleasure you had hoped to derive from the ice cream			0
" finally , do you regularly overeat those carby , fatty foods ? ( you know — the ones you crave the most			1
) here 's how to know : " make good food choices about 90 percent of the time , " says @entity309 , " and reserve the other 10 percent for ' fun calories			1
' " if your comfort - food intake often exceeds that percentage , consider cutting back			0
@entity57 : low - calorie snacks for every craving need more incentive ? recent research indicates that eating a lot of fatty foods can end up negatively affecting your mood over time			1
in a 2012 study from the @entity322 , researchers fed mice diets with different amounts of fat			2
after 12 weeks , the mice that were fed a higher - fat diet showed more signs of depression and anxiety			2
the takeaway : although you initially may feel euphoric from eating fatty foods , the more you do it , the worse you feel			1
the recipe for true happiness just might be healthy , balanced meals , followed now and then by dessert — and as the ever wise @entity5 advised , no regrets			2
food for @entity340 to avoid excessive emotional eating ? try one of these exercises			1
" for a few days , before you eat , force yourself to write down what you 're feeling and thinking at that exact moment , " says exercise psychologist @entity71			1
" seeing your emotions on paper helps you understand what 's happening inside and recognize times when you 're more likely to eat out of something other than hunger			0
" it really works : a 2008 study from the @entity355 , in @entity353 , found that people choose lower - calorie foods when they are aware of their feelings			1
@entity57 : understanding unfamiliar nutritional terms show a little self - compassion			0
the next time you eat in response to a strong emotion , do n't lament your lack of willpower			0
research shows that treating yourself gently may help you stave off future bouts of emotional eating			1
in 2007 researchers at @entity370 , in @entity371 , @entity372 , asked female subjects to taste - test doughnuts			2
@entity375 were n't given any special instruction			0
the other half were given a lesson in self - compassion beforehand			0
the tester said , " i hope you wo n't be too hard on yourself			0
everyone in the study eats this stuff			0
" the result : those who received the " be kind to yourself " mandate ultimately ate fewer sweets			0
or , at the very least , ask your spouse or kids to help around the house a bit more			0
according to a 2012 study from the @entity395 , in @entity396 , @entity397 , feeling burned - out can easily lead to emotional eating			1
researchers found that women who were overwhelmed on the job were significantly more likely to use food as a source of comfort and relief than were those who were not			0
antidote : delegate some of your to - do list			0
or , hey , ditch a few of the items on it altogether .			0

celebratory or comforting meals can often make people feel remorse for indulging themselves
" foods that are laden with carbohydrates , sugar , or fat simply taste delicious , " says @entity71 , @entity72
if you punish yourself after eating , your emotional eating may have gone too far
