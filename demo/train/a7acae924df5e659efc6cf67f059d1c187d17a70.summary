-- in the world of economic and social development , lists are easy to come by			2
the class of leaders gathering in @entity6 are well aware that ranking nations -- by levels of freedom , ease of doing business , competitiveness , fragility -- has become a preferred sport for analysts working for governments , magazines , @entity18 or think tanks around the world			0
but it 's rare to find a surprising result			2
nevertheless , that 's what economists @entity26 and @entity28 , researchers at the @entity25 , have produced with their new @entity30			1
in their global ranking of gdp growth to 2020 , @entity31 comes out number one			2
that 's a head scratcher			2
how could a tiny , land - locked @entity37 nation , best known for @entity38 , lead a list predicting economic growth ? there 's more : @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , and @entity48 round out the top ten			1
@entity26 and @entity51 project that these countries will grow faster than most others in the world , including emerging market favorites @entity56 , @entity57 , and @entity58			2
in fact , thirteen of the top thirty countries for growth are in @entity62			1
@entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 rank 100 , 101 , and 102			0
@entity62 's 2020 growth vision what gives ? to look at the more established lists and tables for development , @entity62 is doing poorly -- at or near the bottom of the heap for gdp per capita , infant mortality , primary school enrollment -- you name it			1
to determine that the booming economies of the next decade lie in @entity62 , @entity26 and @entity77 exit the traditional framework			1
using international trade data since 1964 , the pair developed a metric they call " economic complexity , " which suggests that population growth , industrial webs and networked knowledge may reveal more about future growth than conventional metrics like life expectancy , formal education or political risk			1
not that these factors do n't matter for everyday lives in @entity62 and beyond -- but i like to think of gdp as a metric useful for a certain kind of evaluation that can miss the wider , more human picture			1
the region 's economic potential is more fully realized when complexity is the baseline			1
what is economic complexity ? the authors explain that " society functions because its members form webs that allow them to specialize and share their knowledge with others			1
" the @entity30 focuses on exported goods ( not services ) , tracking how easy it is for an economy to leap from the simple ( growing cotton , or making steel ) to the complex ( manufacturing garments , or building cars )			0
the easier it is for a nation to diversify exports and , in turn , produce skilled workers and pricy exports , the more complex it is			0
thus economic complexity , per @entity26 and @entity77 , " reflects the structures that emerge to hold and combine knowledge			1
" notably , this includes demographic trends and social networks -- the webs and serendipities often lost in pure gdp analysis			0
to derive their ranking for future gdp growth , @entity26 and @entity51 track the gap between complexity and current income			1
and here is where things get interesting			0
@entity147 ( 115 ) and @entity148 ( 126 ) , for example , have long been outperforming their comparatively low levels of complexity			2
based on the lackluster distribution of human skills and knowledge in the private sector , both countries should be a lot less wealthy -- a prediction that may come to fruition soon			2
@entity158 ( 66 ) and the @entity159 ( 88 ) are very complex , but very wealthy -- there 's not much room for improvement			0
in @entity62 , by contrast , many economies are more complex than their levels of income suggest			1
like many countries in the region , @entity31 is poor and poorly governed -- but it 's demographically young , and its private sector is finding its footing			1
since 1988 , exports have diversified from tea and coffee to soaps , oils , beer , cement , iron , steel , and machinery			0
the next decade will see a resulting correction in gdp -- based not just on the income from these exports , but on the leap in " collective knowledge " that comes from the expanded production			0
@entity62 can teach the world to innovate the authors acknowledge that the powerhouse nations of the @entity190 will still drive global economic activity , but that @entity37 countries will leverage existing complexity into income over time			1
@entity62 's sunny outlook also comes from the report 's privileging connections and systems over gdp			1
studies suggest that up to 70 % of economic activity on the continent is informal			0
this churning , parallel marketplace is off the map of official export statistics , but supports the development of what the @entity30 authors call " know - where " -- a corollary of " know - how " that is a hallmark of growing complexity			0
this hidden advantage is further good news for @entity62			1
to be sure , the @entity30 ignores the service - driven aspects of the global economy			0
but it also rejects the analytical habit that says the @entity218 are the most useful predictors of economic development			0
this posture has the legitimacy of accuracy : over 40 years of trade data , the @entity30 outperforms the @entity225 , and is ten times more accurate than the @entity227 's index of competitiveness			0
this demonstrates the drawbacks with empiricism generally : @entity233 political rankings , the @entity234 , @entity235 reports -- not to mention analysis from @entity238 's , @entity239 , and other ratings agencies that proved fallible during regent financial upheavals			0
these can make sweeping claims that affect public and private decision - making			0
this @entity30 -- in which resource - poor nations like @entity245 and @entity246 outperform @entity247 and @entity248 -- gets us closer to a different truth			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity253			2

@entity25 researchers have a new way of predicting @entity37 countries ' growth
the new metric links the level of a country 's complexity with wealth creation
@entity253 *argues* that @entity62 , therefore , may have a hidden economic advantage
