-- nearly a year ago , a big - budget film crew found itself in a most unlikely setting for a movie shoot			1
filming on location in @entity6 at the outbreak of the @entity8 , the international cast of actors and crew wound up at the center of an uprising that would eventually sweep through the region , toppling governments in its wake			1
almost 12 months on from those tumultuous events , @entity6 has had its elections , and the movie -- billed as an @entity20 epic -- is hitting cinema screens			1
" @entity27 " is an ambitious production that unites @entity24 and @entity25 stars with @entity20 talent			1
the story of two tribes fighting over a stretch of desert during the oil boom of the 1930s , it 's being billed as the biggest @entity20 movie since " @entity36			1
" its producers no doubt hope that what 's captured on film will live up to the off - screen drama surrounding its creation -- and appeal to @entity44 audiences as well as those in the @entity46			1
@entity48 actress @entity47 , best known for her role in smash hit " @entity51 , " plays princess @entity52			0
she say she decided to stay in @entity6 when the revolution broke out shortly after filming began , partly as a gesture of solidarity with @entity6			1
" i just felt that if i can just give my support to my @entity6 friends , the ones who i had spent a lot of time with for almost a month , in any possible way , this would be it , " said the 27 - year - old			1
" just stay back and support them and tell them that , you know , things are going to be fine eventually and they just have to fight it out			0
" so , i stayed back and it felt great			0
" @entity75 - @entity74 actor @entity73 plays a prince at the center of a family battle , forced to choose between traditional values and the new world of opportunity offered by oil			2
@entity73 says he could see a parallel between the film 's theme -- the youth fighting against a repressive older order -- and the recent political upheaval			1
" this is destiny , " he said			0
" we began the movie weeks before the revolution ... that 's strange , the parallel between the movie and the news			2
" perhaps best known for his role in 2009 's " a prophet , " @entity73 rejects his billing as the first @entity20 actor to lead a @entity24 film , saying that honor belongs to " @entity36 " star @entity103 , who appeared at the film 's premiere			1
@entity103 had been offered the role of the @entity107 , played in the film by @entity110 actor @entity109 , when the idea for " @entity27 " was initially floated by @entity6 film - maker @entity112 35 years ago			1
@entity112 , the man who persuaded @entity24 directors @entity113 and @entity115 to shoot " @entity117 " and " @entity118 " in his country , said key plot points in the film mirrored political events during the uprising			1
former president @entity123 @entity122 fled office on the same day the crew shot a scene in which @entity109 ' character , @entity107 , " loses his empire to his son - in - law , who should be the future of that country , " said the producer			0
" there was some interesting parallels			0
" @entity75 director @entity135 said he felt in a " cocoon " from the drama of the revolution during filming			1
" i remember being on the set in @entity141 and being interviewed by @entity0 and they said ' so , what about the revolution ? ' i said ' it 's strange , i feel here i 'm in the ' 30s , and outside i 'm not really sure what 's happening			2
' " despite this , he said , the film - makers " knew that the story in the contemporary world was reflecting the problems we were talking about in the movie			2
" so it was very fascinating , and having all my crew , who were @entity6 , being so involved in what was happening in the cities around us , made our movie even more thoughtful and timeless			2
" @entity135 said he had wanted to make the film since he first visited the region 20 years ago and discovered a very different society from what he had been led to expect			0
" people did n't really understand this part of the world			0
they did n't understand the generosity , the hospitality , " he said			0
" i felt very happy and i wanted to make a movie about this part of the world			0
and i was impatient to do it because i felt something was needed urgently			0
" @entity174 actor @entity173 said the role of @entity112 was the second or third @entity20 character he had played , and he hoped @entity20 actors would get the same opportunity to play characters from a different background			0
" why should n't @entity20 get the chance to play whoever they want , whether they are from @entity74 , @entity183 , whoever ( wherever ) ? " he said			0
