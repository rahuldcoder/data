@entity0 , @entity1 -- back in 2010 , the conservative columnist and @entity2 contributor @entity3 was worried about what he saw in his own party			2
@entity3 , who had worked as a speechwriter for president @entity8 , feared that @entity9 would be tempted by tea party @entity9 to shift far to the right to achieve short - term electoral gains that would cost the party in the long run			1
" a party must champion the values of the voters it already has , " @entity3 wrote , then warning , " but it must also speak to the votes it still needs to win			2
" for several years , the tea party helped energize a moribund @entity9			1
after the 2008 election , with conservatives reeling from the dismal approval ratings of @entity8 and the defeat of @entity24 , tea party activists injected some life into the @entity9 grass roots , bringing out voters in the primaries who were frustrated with the political status quo			1
they pushed the @entity9 to focus more on the issue of deficit reduction and government spending , while creating immense pressure on the congressional leadership to avoid compromises			2
the midterm elections of 2010 put president @entity41 on the defensive and constrained him for much of his first term			2
but @entity3 was right about the long run			0
the tea party has extracted some very high costs from the party from which it will be difficult to recover			1
the most immediate cost was control of the @entity50			0
in 2010 and 2012 , tea party activists knocked out some powerful @entity9 candidates who probably would have been victorious and improved the chances for the party to win a majority in the @entity50			1
is the tea party ready to deal on the fiscal cliff ? in 2010 , the nation was riveted when @entity59 defeated @entity61 rep. @entity60 in @entity62 in the @entity9 primary			1
most agree @entity60 would have won the @entity50 seat			0
the seat went to a @entity65			0
@entity67 's @entity66 and @entity69 's @entity68 suffered similar fates			0
this year , powerhouse sen. @entity71 of @entity72 was defeated by @entity73 , who uttered some explosive comments about abortion that fueled perceptions the @entity9 was far right			0
besides the @entity50 , the electoral costs were also evident in the @entity9 presidential primaries , when @entity81 felt the need to make the kinds of " severely conservative " statements that cost him enormously in the election			1
the tea party @entity9 also made it difficult for @entity9 to sign off on a $ 4 trillion " grand bargain " about taxes and spending when @entity41 's back was to the wall in 2011			1
the most zealous @entity9 were unwilling to capitulate to the president on the issue of tax increases in return for the spending cuts they sought			0
they gambled that @entity61 would elect a @entity9 in 2012 , which would give them free rein on @entity101			0
but things turned out quite differently			0
instead , republicans do n't have control of the @entity104 and face the possibility of taxes going up for all taxpayers , as well as steep cuts in defense , if nothing is done			0
they do n't have the leverage that existed in the post- 2010 election			0
by most indications , they will now have to settle for ending some of @entity8 's tax cuts and possibly domestic spending cuts that are not as deep as they could have gotten a few years ago			2
if the automatic cuts go through , a product of the failure to reach a deal when the wind was at their backs , conservatives will see heavy reductions on defense , something not likely to please the @entity9 base			0
even if an acceptable deal goes through , after the 2012 election @entity61 will likely see @entity41 as the driving force and @entity9 taking a deal because they did n't have any other choice			0
the tea party has also undermined efforts by the @entity9 to position itself as the party of governance rather than the party of extremism			1
the tea partiers are part of a dynamic in the party , that started with @entity147 's run in 1964 , which pushed out moderates and made it more difficult for the @entity9 to build a long - term coalition , as @entity152 documents in his book " @entity154			1
" the demand to remain ideologically pure has consistently pushed @entity9 leaders to move to avoid saying yes to almost anything , preventing @entity104 speaker @entity158 and @entity50 minority leader @entity159 from cutting deals			1
the inaction of the @entity9 and the ideologically charged rhetoric from its members have played directly into arguments by scholars such as @entity166 and @entity167 that the @entity9 is moving far to the right and is responsible for the dysfunctional state of politics in @entity171			0
finally , the tea party is making it increasingly difficult for @entity9 to win over hugely important voting blocs that can play a major role in 2016 and 2020			1
in 2012 , the @entity9 paid dearly among @entity177 voters for the rising power of hard - line anti-immigration advocates			2
the tea party helped to drown out voices such as those of @entity8 who believed the party needed to broaden its appeal and reach out to new constituencies , not shrink its electoral map			1
they have also turned off many younger millennial voters , another key constituency finding less to like about the @entity9			2
all of these point to the ways in which the embrace of the tea party has taken its toll on the @entity9			1
recently , observing the losses that resulted from tea party candidates , @entity3 asked : " have we learned our lesson yet ? " the answer is uncertain			1
at a moment when the party needs to avoid an electoral free fall with more red states turning blue , or at least becoming swing states , party leaders need to do some hard thinking about whether one of their greatest challenges does not come from @entity77 , but from within			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity208 .			0

@entity208 : the tea party helped @entity9 bounce back from @entity8 years , @entity24 loss
he says the short - term boost was *overshadowed* by the long - term *damage*
republicans moved far to the right to win tea party votes , only to lose the center , he says
@entity208 : @entity9 lost some key @entity50 races , finds itself on the defensive in *budget* talks
