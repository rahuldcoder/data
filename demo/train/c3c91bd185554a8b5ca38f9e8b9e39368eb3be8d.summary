@entity0 , @entity1 -- on any given monday , @entity3 -- the commercial center of @entity0 -- is a bustling , chaotic mess of rickshaws and cars jockeying for space in overcrowded streets with an equally determined mass of pushing , shoving pedestrians			1
@entity3 resembled a battleground , desolate and destroyed			2
a day earlier , it was			1
throughout the day and late into the night sunday , police and paramilitary troops battled with @entity16 who laid siege to the area			1
half a million of them , by many accounts			2
it ended when security forces , 10,000 - strong , moved into the area early monday morning to disperse the protesters			1
exactly how many died in the confrontation might never be known			2
the national news agency , @entity26 ( @entity27 ) , put the count at 14 dead and more than and more than 75 wounded			1
among them were three police officers , a paramilitary trooper and a 12 - year - old boy			1
police in various cities reported a total of 18 deaths as violence spread			1
human rights activists say the final count will be much higher -- one that the government may be loath to share			1
photographs that appeared on online blogs and websites show bodies lying on stairwells or cowered in building corners -- bullet wounds to the head or back , or a pool of blood beside them			2
to avoid a repeat of sunday 's violence , police declared no rallies and gatherings can take place all day monday in @entity0			1
and they escorted the @entity63 group 's leader out of @entity0			1
so protesters focused their efforts elsewhere			2
in @entity68 , a city near the capital , @entity16 torched vehicles and fought pitched battles with police			1
in the port city of @entity73 , they clashed with police -- with fatalities reported but not confirmed			1
how it began the @entity16 are members of the ultra-conservative @entity77 ( protectors of @entity16 )			1
they gathered sunday in numbers that boggled the mind			0
photos taken from balconies and rooftops showed a sea of bodies dressed in white panjabis and kufis -- both traditional @entity89 attire in @entity1 -- cramming the streets of @entity3 to the hilt			0
they demanded that the government enact laws that put to death anyone who blasphemed @entity16			1
they called for mandatory @entity16 education for all in this secular @entity89 nation			1
they wanted a ban on statues , and the words " absolute trust and faith in the @entity106 " reinstated in the constitution			0
they declared that men and women should not be allowed to mix freely in this country of 150 million			0
and they vowed they would not leave until their demands -- 13 in all -- were met			0
the ensuing confrontation was violent			0
country 's direction at stake what is happening in @entity1 is a push and pull between two forces to determine the future direction of the country			0
in february , thousands and thousands of youths held a month - long sit - in in another part of the capital , @entity129 , demanding the death penalty for those who took part in war crimes during @entity1 's bloody battle for independence from @entity135			1
many of those accused of war crimes now hold prominent position in @entity63 parties			0
are you affected by the protests in @entity1 ? send us your thoughts and experiences but stay safe			0
the rallies , led by youths and fueled by social media , also tried to achieve something else : a ban on extreme fundamentalist parties			2
but @entity1 is also the fourth most populous @entity89 country in the world			0
and the radical elements of the religion were not going to sit by idly as those rallies grew			2
the @entity16 let their presence known with larger and larger rallies and strikes , first in cities outside @entity0 and then in the capital city			1
each time they came out , police officers with batons followed			1
the @entity16 ' tactic has been to turn the criticism on its head : by criticizing them , they seemed to say , you criticize @entity16			1
they called the @entity129 participants " anti-islamic atheists " who deserve death for defaming the religion but who are protected by the government			0
and so , when the @entity77 protesters gathered sunday , that was one of their main demands : put to death these " atheists			0
" battles for hours clashes broke out when @entity185 activists tried to break a police cordon			2
the street battles went on for hours , with police firing rubber bullets and tear gas and the @entity16 hurling crude explosives and chunks of brick			1
@entity194 , secretary - general of the ruling @entity195 and a government minister , said demonstrators set fire to the @entity199 of @entity1 office and ransacked several other business establishments in central @entity0			1
@entity202 , the managing editor of @entity27 , said the service had to suspend operations for the day after @entity185 activists set a fire at the entrance of its office			1
blame to go around the government , rights groups say , shares blame not just for its crackdown but also for muffling the free speech of the @entity16			1
on monday , authorities shut down the offices of @entity217 and @entity218 stations after they aired footage of the clashes			2
" they came in early in the morning and ordered us closed , " staffer @entity221 told @entity2			0
information minister @entity224 told reporters the stations " provoked violence ( by ) spreading hatred and rumors			0
" last month , the government shut down another opposition newspaper			0
" this is what i and many others feared when the @entity129 movement started , " said @entity231 , a @entity1 expatriate in @entity232 , @entity233			0
" does it matter that @entity185 is misguided ? does it matter that their vision of @entity16 is as twisted as the @entity242 's ? " before , i did n't know about these guys ; they were a fringe group that pranced about in @entity73			1
now security has stabilized situation , but i fear it is pushing the country closer to a civil war			0
" reminders everywhere monday morning , the reminders of the weekend violence were everywhere			2
@entity252 smoldered from rubbish heaps			0
fires burned inside ransacked stores			0
bricks and rocks littered the streets			0
shopkeepers held up pages from copies of @entity262 burned in shop fires and wailed , " those who did this are not @entity89			0
" bulldozers pushed the debris to the side			0
@entity1 is still reeling from the aftermath of a catastrophic building collapse last month where the death toll continues to mount : more than 650 by monday			2
but @entity1 are resilient people			0
by monday afternoon , the rickshaws and the cars were back on the streets in @entity3			2
so were the street peddlers and the pedestrians			0
the cars blared their horns , the rickshaws squeezed into every available space			0
life , it appeared , was slowly returning to normal			0
