@entity0 -- sen. @entity2 is punching back at her opponent after getting slammed by @entity4 this week over missing a classified briefing on @entity6 and other security threats to attend a fundraiser			1
in a tv ad released first to @entity1 on friday , the @entity10 @entity9 rebukes @entity4 attacks , plays up her voting attendance record on the @entity14 and slams her rival @entity10 house speaker @entity15 as a " hypocrite			0
" @entity2 admitted earlier this week that she missed an @entity14 meeting to attend a fundraiser			1
what she did n't tell reporters in that post-debate press conference was that the meeting was in fact a classified briefing on @entity6 and other national security threats with the director of national intelligence @entity25			0
the revelation has given @entity4 fresh fodder to slam @entity2 's already shaky attendance record at @entity14 hearings , but @entity2 's campaign is looking to spotlight @entity15 ' own irregular attendance record			1
@entity2 's ad spotlights @entity15 ' record of missing legislative work in favor of fundraising , which even prompted his hometown paper to call for @entity15 ' resignation -- a clip featured in the latest @entity2 ad			1
the ad also claims @entity15 has " no military plan to take out @entity6 " and plays up @entity2 's 98 % voting attendance record and says she " leads hearings on eradicating terrorists like @entity6			1
" @entity2 's tv spot was released the same day the @entity50 - tied @entity49 pushed an ad playing back @entity2 's post-debate statement			2
" you know , there was one , " @entity2 told reporters on tuesday			2
" and what had happened at that hearing , it was scheduled early in the day , and then votes were scheduled , and then that hearing had to be postponed later that day			0
so yes , i did miss that one			0
" that statement rolls uncut for 14 seconds in the 30 - second sport after viewers are led in with footage of masked gun - wielding @entity6 militants while a narrator talks about @entity6 's " mass murder " campaign , threats of terrorism on @entity73 soil and beheading of @entity73			0
" @entity2 skipped the hearing for a fundraiser , " the ad closes			1
and when confronted with his own voting record , @entity15 deflected a question about his habit of putting cash campaigning before his state legislature duties			0
" quite honestly , if i had anything approaching the seriousness of the threat of @entity6 , i would have canceled anything i was doing			0
" " there is nothing more important than receiving briefings on our national security , " @entity15 told reporters on a conference call wednesday			0
" it 's the top responsibility of every @entity96			0
senator @entity2 has failed to do her job			2
what is her excuse for not showing up to work over half the time ? " the @entity103 senator 's campaign had earlier confirmed that @entity2 attended less than half of the committee 's 49 public hearings in the last two years , but that none of those absences were tied to fundraisers			1
faced with questions wednesday about why it had n't revealed that a fundraiser trumped a hearing , the campaign insisted it had n't been not forthcoming because that list of missed hearings did n't include closed - door briefings -- like the one she missed feb. 27 to attend a @entity119 fundraiser			1
republicans immediately pounced on the report that @entity2 missed a crucial briefing on the @entity6 threat , an issue that now has the potential to swing the already neck and neck race in @entity15 's favor			1
polling over the last week has shown @entity2 maintaining a razor - thin two - to four - point lead over her challenger			2
@entity133 ad : @entity15 in @entity136 brothers ' pocket charges that incumbents have missed hearings , briefings , votes , and other official work are popping up in a several closely - fought @entity143 races this year			1
and in the @entity4 - leaning @entity145 state , which boasts a large military population , @entity15 is betting @entity2 's absences from a national security hearings and at least one intelligence briefing will hurt the first - term senator			2
@entity103 campaign operatives in @entity0 , who are already battling headwinds in their effort to keep the @entity143 in @entity103 control , conducted private polling on the question so they could fully understand its impact			0
the results showed the issue is very potent and could damage even seasoned candidates			0
@entity4 are seizing on the @entity6 threat , with @entity4 ads and accusations flying in @entity164 and @entity165 hitting @entity103 @entity143 candidates for missing hearings on @entity6			1
@entity4 stokes border fears over @entity169 , @entity6			0

sen. @entity2 admitted this week she missed a hearing on isis and other threats to attend a fundraiser .
other incumbents are facing heat in other *key* @entity143 races for missing hearings .
republicans immediately pounced on the report with several ads slamming her absence .
