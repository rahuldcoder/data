there are things that i admire about @entity3			2
he has maintained a lifelong commitment to newspapers , long after it became clear that they were no longer profitable			0
he has a feistiness at 81 , when he could be happily sitting on a yacht somewhere			0
he now spews his opinions on that newfangled social network called @entity13 , and since he 's the undisputed kingpin of @entity14 , who 's going to stop him ? but over the weekend , @entity3 sent out a tweet that went beyond outrageous to offensive , truly offensive			1
he played off the worst kind of historical libel against @entity20			2
and while he later tweeted a semi-apology , it 's not clear he understands the magnitude of his hurtful words			2
watch : @entity3 's ' @entity25 ' rant -- more ceos spewing on twitter the subject was the violence flaring in the @entity31 , with @entity32 mounting airstrikes in @entity34 after a long series of rocket attacks by the @entity38 government			1
the message : " why is jewish owned press so consistently anti-israel in every crisis ? " that 's right , he said @entity20 - owned press , reviving the old canard about @entity20 controlling the media			1
who , exactly , is he talking about ? watch : @entity48 overkill or permissable pandering ? well , there 's the @entity20 heritage of the @entity52 family , which owns the @entity54 and @entity3 sees as a rival			1
beyond that , most major media outlets are owned by public companies : @entity69 ( @entity70 ) , @entity67 ( @entity68 ) , @entity65 ( @entity66 ) , @entity61 ( @entity62 ) , @entity63 ( @entity63 and @entity64 ) , @entity60 ( @entity59 )			0
the @entity72 family , which owns the @entity74 , is n't @entity20			0
and is n't there something rich in a complaint about media ownership by the man who controls @entity80 , the @entity80 broadcast network , @entity80 , the @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , the @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 and other properties ? beyond that , it 's hard to take ethical lectures from a man who presided over a phone - hacking scandal in @entity94 that -- whatever his knowledge of it -- prompted him to close the longstanding @entity98 tabloid and has led to the arrests of several of his former lieutenants			1
watch : orgy of advice on getting away with @entity48 - like affair what 's more , @entity3 has never been shy about interfering in his newsrooms -- cozying up to politicians ranging from @entity107 to @entity108 and @entity109 -- so maybe he expects others to shape news coverage in the same way			1
@entity3 's @entity80 portrayed @entity113 as a more viable candidate than he turned out to be			1
but the heart of @entity3 's indictment is far more troubling			1
he is suggesting that @entity20 @entity117 have a hidden agenda in which their religion trumps their commitment to journalism			1
since @entity3 finds these outlets allegedly dominated by @entity20 to be anti-israel , perhaps he thinks they are of the self - loathing variety			1
in a tweet on sunday , @entity3 seemed to defend his use of the phrase : " ' jewish owned press ' have been sternly criticized , suggesting link to @entity20 reporters			1
do n't see this , but apologise unreservedly			0
" the wording is too cryptic to know for what exactly he 's apologizing			0
watch : why @entity113 's ' gifts ' comments diminish him earlier , @entity3 had tweeted that @entity32 's position was " precarious , " adding " watch @entity62 and @entity138 bias to the point of embarrassment			2
" media mogul or not , he 's entitled to criticize other coverage as he sees fit			0
but it 's hard to evaluate his complaints since his 140 characters contain not a single example of questionable reporting			0
the @entity31 is a minefield for even the most scrupulous journalists			0
a photo of a wounded @entity151 often brings complaints that @entity32 is being treated unfairly and its casualties not highlighted			0
a story on @entity32 wounded by @entity38 rockets often causes grumbling that the @entity151 plight is being unfairly minimized			0
@entity3 is obviously strongly pro-israel , which may mean he bristles at any coverage that does n't sympathize with @entity160 's government			2
one thing , however , is clear : @entity3 has undermined his own credibility by lashing out at what he calls @entity20 - owned organizations			2
he should follow the advice that editors routinely give employees : think hard before you tweet , for words , like weapons , can wound .			0

@entity172 : @entity3 tweeted asking why @entity20 owned press is anti-israel
he says suggesting @entity20 have hidden agenda , where religion trumps journalism , is offensive
@entity172 : it 's *hypocritical* from man who controls @entity80 , @entity83 , @entity82 , other news organs
@entity172 : " apology ' tweet cryptic ; @entity3 's slam of reporters ' ' biased ' coverage gives no proof
