-- a whole lot of us are stuck with credit - card debt that goes up each month , mortgages worth more than our homes and student loans that extend into infinity			2
so it 's only natural that we look at the debt crisis from the bottom up : from the perspective of the 99 % who are getting screwed			1
but what if we instead looked at this whole mess from the top down , from the point of view of the 1 % : the billionaires and venture capitalists in @entity21 's world ? maybe , just maybe , their problem is our problem			1
in fact , as i have come to see it , short of civilization - ending revolution , solving the debt crisis might actually mean saving the 1 %			1
they have the power and the money , they own our government , and they wo n't go down without taking everyone and everything else with them			1
instead of backing them even further into the corner of fear and defensiveness , we need to help them find a way out			2
and that means helping them understand how they got there			2
the debt crisis is not entirely president @entity49 's or president @entity51 's fault			0
it 's not even @entity54 ' fault			0
it actually resulted from a short - term " fix " to the economy made about 700 years ago			0
see , for pretty much the entire first millennium -- what we call the @entity61 -- the 00.01 % , the feudal lords , enjoyed total control over the land and its people			1
the 99.99 % worked the land and served the lords , who created no value at all			1
but by around 1100 , the @entity70 moved a whole lot of people and stuff around @entity74			1
peasants were exposed to sugar , cotton and all sorts of new weaving and milling technologies for the first time			1
former peasant farmers started to get smarter and more productive			0
they established market days and traded what they grew and made with one another			0
they invented local currencies to store and exchange value instead of bartering			0
local currency then worked very differently from the money we use today			1
someone would simply bring grain they harvested to the grain store , and come out with a foil receipt			0
the receipt could be broken into smaller pieces , which served as money			1
since some grain was lost to spoilage , the currency 's value went down over time			1
this meant it had to be spent instead of saved			0
so the money circulated very rapidly			1
people got wealthy , invested in upkeep on their windmills , paid one another good wages , and got taller			1
little towns got so rich that they built cathedrals			0
that 's how a peer - to - peer economy works			0
watch : " pawning " for rich people but the aristocrats were n't participating in any of this wealth			1
without a dependent peasant class , they had no way to survive			0
they did n't know how to do anything themselves			0
they needed a way to make money simply by having money			1
so they came up with some ways to force new kinds of dependence			1
their first trick was to outlaw local currency			1
if people wanted to trade among themselves , they would have to borrow money from the central treasury , with interest			1
wars were fought , blood was spilled , but they got their way			0
we have all but forgotten that the money we use today is a monopoly currency that costs us more than it 's worth			1
the second great idea was the chartered monopoly : the corporation			0
it gave just one firm -- one friend of the king -- the authority to do business in a certain industry			0
the @entity160 @entity159 , for example , had all rights to cotton in @entity163			0
a farmer was n't permitted to sell his cotton to neighbors , or to make it into anything			2
he had to sell it at fixed prices to the company , which shipped it to @entity173 and let some other chartered corporation make mittens and hats , which were then shipped back to @entity163 for sale			2
that 's why we fought the revolution			0
the problem with this scheme is that it works by stifling innovation and competition			0
the wealthy stay wealthy by extracting value instead of creating it			2
the more value they extract , the more laws they write protecting the rights and privileges of the extractors			2
as companies like @entity196 realized , it was better to sell off productive assets and become more like a bank			0
the system was created for people who have money to make money			1
the value creators are the chumps			0
the most surprising victims in this whole saga , however , are the corporations themselves			0
you think you 're scared ? talk to the heads of @entity163 's corporations			0
they have sucked all the money out of the system , and do n't know how to create any more			1
according to @entity216 , asset profitability for @entity163 firms has steadily fallen 75 % over the last 40 years			2
in other words , corporations have managed to absorb all the money , but they do n't know how to do anything with it			2
they have no skills , no competencies and no vision			0
it 's not the 99 % who need to retrain themselves in order to get jobs			2
it 's the 1 % who need to face the fact that their 600 - year workaround of the value creation has reached the very endpoint of diminishing returns			1
they need to consider whether they might actually make more money at this stage of the game by helping people create value instead of actively preventing it			1
what would that look like ? right now , companies like @entity248 , @entity249 , @entity250 , @entity251 and even @entity252 and @entity253 are at least pointed in the right direction			0
they create and sell tools and services that give people and small businesses the ability to create and exchange value with one another again			1
they understand that real value creation comes by fostering the peer - to - peer transactions of a bottom - up marketplace rather than simply repressing such activity			0
but we , the 99 % , are the only ones who can show them the way			2
we need to begin by abandoning the fruitless quest for gainful corporate employment , and instead start working for ourselves and one another			0
we must stop outsourcing our savings and investments to bankrupt corporations , and instead invest in the people and businesses in our own communities -- however we define those			2
in doing so , we will very quickly create demand for the kinds of networks , supply chains and services that only larger companies can provide			2
we will give the 1 % an opportunity to re-educate themselves , to find a path to success , and -- for the first time in centuries -- to experience the guilt - free satisfaction of working for a living			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity298 .			1

@entity298 says the richest people tend to make money from finance
he says *historically* , aristocracy took control from peasants of currency and its value
over time , they learned how to extract value and forgot how to create it , he says
@entity298 : the 1 % could play a key role in new ways of creating value
