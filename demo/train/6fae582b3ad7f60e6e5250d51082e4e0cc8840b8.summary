-- there are typically two types of comic book movies -- movies like " @entity5 " and movies like " @entity7			2
" that is , there are some comics that should be really good movies , but because of a bad script , director or actors ( sometimes all of the above ) they end up cinematic duds like " ghost rider			0
" and there are some comics that make the transition to the big screen really well with the help of great writers , directors and actors , like " @entity7			0
" movie producers are bringing a fairly serious comic book character , @entity27 ' " @entity26 , " ( played by @entity28 ) to the big screen on friday			1
the trailer from @entity31 ( whose parent company , @entity32 , also owns @entity0 ) looks like it 's anything but			0
early reviews are n't kind			0
by mid-friday morning , the film had earned a rotten 11 - percent rating on @entity37			0
if you 're not already familiar with the character , here 's the gist : as a boy , @entity26 's drunk and abusive father sells him to an @entity45 tribe			1
@entity26 lives with the @entity45 as a slave but wins the favor of the chief and becomes a free member			1
he gets separated from the tribe as an adult , ends up fighting for the @entity51 in the @entity52 -- even accidentally shooting @entity53 -- and ultimately wanders out @entity54			0
but when he comes back to the tribe , a fight with a rival leads to his banishment and a new life as a bounty hunter			0
see @entity61 's brief history of @entity26			1
the original run of the comic spanned the 1970s and 1980s , but the title was revived in the early 1990s and more recently in 2006			1
in later issues of the first run , @entity26 would be pulled through time , meeting up with @entity67 and a handful of other @entity27 superheroes			1
" @entity26 " falls prey to a common problem with comics - turned - movies : the stories span years , sometimes decades			1
most fans are only familiar with a comic book 's story from the point when they start reading			2
but even so , fans of @entity26 know him as the star of a @entity82 comic , not a superhero comic			1
@entity85 producers , however , know @entity27 as a powerhouse of superheroes , and they seem to have different expectations of " @entity26			1
" based on the trailer , @entity26 now has mystical and magical abilities to raise and speak with the dead			2
his place in the @entity52 is downplayed			0
there are no major characters who are @entity97			0
@entity99 stars as a gun toting prostitute , a never - before - seen friend of our hero			0
and " q " from the @entity111 franchise apparently had forerunners in frontier towns who provide @entity26 with horse - mounted gatling guns and hand - held , dynamite - firing crossbows			2
@entity26 's story should make a good movie			1
" @entity26 " should be one of those comic - based movies that does n't need many changes to work			1
but instead of trying to stay true to the comic , it appears that producers are hoping to attract a casual movie - going audience by sacrificing the original flavor of the character and story			2
the result appears to be a campy movie that alienates both fans and regular moviegoers			0
looks like we 're in " @entity5 " territory .			0

the *storyline* for " @entity26 " comic books spans decades
@entity27 's title *portrays* @entity26 as a @entity82 *vigilante* , not a superhero
" @entity26 " the movie looks like it will be very different from the comic
