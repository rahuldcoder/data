-- the first thing @entity2 may do upon waking these days is pinch himself to check that everything really is as it seems			1
as if topping the @entity6 and progressing in both the @entity7 and @entity8 were not enough , the @entity5 manager has now been handed another gift -- a hefty slab of cash			2
for too many years since he took charge in 1996 , @entity2 has been financially handcuffed in the transfer market following the strict spending criteria determined by the @entity5 board			1
but monday 's announcement that the @entity6 side and the @entity19 kit supplier @entity18 had signed the largest commercial deal in both companies ' history has cast such caution to one side			1
for the @entity25 can not only invest in the next @entity26 but also shape the @entity28 ' future for years to come			0
coming into effect on july 1 , the five - year deal with @entity18 is worth nearly $ 250 million according to media reports			2
" the money will begin to flow in ( in july ) and will be available for us to invest in the team , " @entity5 chief executive @entity32 told @entity33			1
the tie - in with @entity18 ends a 20 - year association with rival sportswear company @entity39 , with @entity5 believing that their new partner can not only give them bespoke attention but also help drive inroads to important " markets like @entity44 and the @entity45			1
" as he spoke with a mix of excitement and pride , @entity32 was adamant that @entity2 would soon be signing a new contract that would enable him to continue his transformation of @entity5			1
" we have always been committed to @entity2 and he 's always been committed to the club , " he said			1
" i 'm sure @entity2 will commit his future to the club , and we will commit ours to his			2
that will be done at the right time -- quietly -- and then we will let you guys [ the press ] know			0
" the coach 's contract is set to expire at the end of the season , but @entity2 may well put pen to paper on more than just the deal that will continue his 18 - year tenure			1
" we will invest in not just big - name signings but also right across the club -- in the youth academy , scouting network , facilities , " @entity32 explained			2
" there are a lot of things that go into a football club like this			0
" @entity5 hopes its relationship with @entity18 can finally put the @entity79 on an equal financial footing with some of @entity82 's biggest clubs			1
@entity5 came eighth in the annual money table of the world 's richest clubs published last week by business firm @entity87			2
but the @entity28 ' revenue of $ 384 million was dwarfed by that of @entity90 , who topped the table for a record ninth consecutive year given the @entity95 giants ' income of $ 702 million			0
despite lying just three places higher in fifth , even @entity25 champions @entity96 boasted a far greater revenue of $ 538 million			0
famously without a trophy since 2005 , @entity5 's fallow period may soon bring forth years of plenty following a phase of reconstruction , albeit one that has not sat too well with the club 's fans			1
nonetheless , @entity32 believes the times are certainly changing			0
" the football landscape has changed dramatically over the last decade and @entity5 has made some difficult decisions along the way to put ourselves in a position to compete in the longer term , " he added			2
" i do think we are now progressing as a football club , making some big steps forward -- both on and off the pitch -- and the off - the - pitch stuff is important to drive what we do on the pitch			0
" as we look forward over the next five years , we are very excited about the future of the football club			0
" less than eighteen months ago , there were widespread claims that @entity5 -- the longest serving member of @entity128 's top flight and a 13 - time champion to boot -- had been reduced to a selling club			1
the clamor of dissent was impossible to ignore in august 2012 as star striker @entity134 joined @entity135 , a controversial sale that followed on from those of leading assets @entity138 and @entity140 among others a year earlier			0
fast forward to september 2013 and @entity5 made its greatest statement of intent in over a decade as @entity26 was signed from @entity90 , his transfer fee of $ 66 million eclipsing the @entity28 ' previous record outlay by more than $ 40 million			0
" our goal has been clear -- which is to be one of the leading football clubs in the world -- and we 're driving towards that , " said @entity32			0
" we want to be able to compete with the very best in the game			0
" the move to the [ @entity155 in 2006 ] was a critical part of our long term plan but the new commercial partnerships that we are entering into are just as critical			0
" meanwhile , @entity18 now add @entity5 to a portfolio that includes the @entity160 , @entity162 's 2013 @entity7 runners - up @entity163 and @entity165 sprint king @entity164 .			1
