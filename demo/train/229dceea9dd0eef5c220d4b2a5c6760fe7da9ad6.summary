-- it has become a permanent fixture on the football calendar , and as the @entity4 prepares to descend on @entity5 once again , it seems a permanent touchdown is fast approaching			1
as the @entity8 and @entity10 jet in for sunday 's sixth annual regular season clash at @entity12 , there is a growing sense that an @entity4 franchise could be based fulltime in the @entity17 capital before this decade is out			1
with the league having voted to persist with the experiment until at least 2016 , and the @entity21 committing to four years of visits to @entity5 , the @entity4 is hoping to build on the spike in interest since landing firm feet on foreign shores in 2005			1
@entity4 commissioner @entity27 confirmed at the announcement of this new affirmation to overseas football that the latest deal would increase the swell of support for the game -- likely to be necessary if a franchise is to flourish across the @entity36			1
@entity4 's @entity10 play 3 home games in @entity5 but if a team is to base itself in @entity39 , be it in @entity5 or anywhere else , it must commit to ingraining the culture of the game in the city it adopts as a new home and guard against antagonizing @entity49 - based fans , according to sports business expert @entity50			1
" successful overseas expansion will require the @entity4 to create and embed a culture of @entity53 in overseas territories which will need them to successfully engage with local stakeholders , " he told @entity0			2
" as for us fans , it is important they see that the sport 's core values and traditional markets are not being compromised or undermined by overseas expansion			0
" moreover , i think the @entity4 has to ' sell ' expansion to existing fans as being important for the future sustainability and success of the sport			2
" building a fan base if a franchise was to touch down in @entity5 , its success would hinge on the following it attracts -- something the league has been trying to build since the first regular - season match between the @entity77 and the @entity78 drew a crowd of 81,000 to @entity12 in 2007			1
but the figures are promising			0
according to the @entity4 , there is a fan base of 11 million in the @entity17 , which represents a 32 % increase in the last two years			2
more people are playing the game at amateur level too			0
television numbers are also on the rise , with sunday games showing a 154 % increase in viewers , while the amount of people watching the showpiece @entity93 has gone up by 74 % since 2006			0
@entity27 has admitted that part of the @entity4 's reasoning for extending its period of moonlighting in @entity5 is to pave the way for a future franchise			1
" if we can play multiple regular - season games there , that gives you a better opportunity to be successful if you choose to put a franchise in @entity5 , " @entity27 said , in comments sent to @entity0 by the @entity4			1
" but again , that is the other reason for putting two games in @entity5 -- we are trying to build that fan base in @entity5			2
we welcome the fans coming from other parts of @entity39			0
" but this is a way to really build that fan base right now in @entity5 , which will be critical if you did have a franchise there			2
" capital attraction according to @entity27 , @entity4 teams are clamoring to visit @entity5 as they bid to spread the word about their teams and their cities , attract new fans and to tap into potentially lucrative new revenue streams			1
@entity126 owner @entity125 said his team 's clash with the @entity129 in 2013 would offer acute exposure of " @entity132 's impressive business community and tourism industry , " as well as offering the franchise 's @entity39 - based fans a chance to see the team in action			1
but @entity50 says it will be difficult for the @entity4 to fully infiltrate a country that has a fervent following of its major three sports -- soccer , cricket and rugby -- because of its intrinsically @entity49 nature			1
" the @entity4 is one of those sports that is deeply socio - culturally embedded -- it is quintessentially @entity49 , which means it only has limited appeal outside its core markets , in much the same way as a sport like cricket , " he said			1
" attendances for @entity4 games in cities like @entity5 have been healthy and are likely to generate a financial return for the @entity4			1
yet how sustainable such revenue streams might be across a season are open to question			0
" hence , games in overseas territories are about building a fan base with a view to generating long - term financial return			0
the sustainability of sports such as the @entity4 requires both a culture shift and the implementation of an appropriate strategy			2
" the culture shift needs to place in the hearts and minds of potential customers ; the strategy needs to acknowledge that a different approach to the marketing the @entity4 in the @entity17 is needed compared to the @entity49			1
" a need for new markets @entity8 owner @entity180 is certainly a fan of the idea , as his outfit prepare for their second visit to @entity12			2
in quotes on the @entity4 's international website , @entity184 says the game is in danger of " tapping out " in the @entity49 due to increased popularity			1
" if you look at the last @entity93 in this past season , we had over 180 million people watching -- that 's almost two - thirds of @entity49 , " he said			2
" so for us to grow the game , we have to expand globally			0
i think i said that the last time we were over here in 2009 and before this next decade is out , i hope we have a team here			0
" i think that would be right for the @entity4 and this fan base has proven they deserve it			0
" the @entity4 is n't the only @entity49 sport to travel to @entity39 in search of greater riches			2
the @entity205 staged its first regular season game in @entity5 in march 2011 -- the 16th it has played on foreign soil in countries such as @entity209 and @entity210			1
the @entity211 has also dipped its toe in the @entity213 , holding the first regular season match in 2007			1
international competition it 's not just @entity49 sports seeking worldwide expansion , but some of these plans have n't gone down as well as the @entity4 's proposal			1
soccer club @entity223 , for example , refused to play the preseason @entity226 in @entity227 , despite the @entity229 league having signed a deal with a @entity232 promoter			0
@entity223 said @entity232 was too far away for club members who might want to attend the game , though it did acknowledge @entity232 represents an " attractive market			0
" there was a strong backlash against the idea of a 39th @entity241 match to be held overseas when the possibility was mooted several years ago , as domestic fans bridled at the prospect that administrators might tamper with their beautiful game			0
but @entity248 sides @entity247 and @entity249 had no such qualms , as they contested the @entity251 in @entity227 's @entity252 back in august			0
@entity50 added : " increasingly , it is a trend for sports to take their domestic games abroad , from @entity248 football 's @entity226 , to @entity257 with races in places like @entity260			0
the long - term sustainability of some sports increasingly appears to be dictated by an ability to successfully internationalize and globalize			0
" the @entity241 clubs already do this themselves ; the @entity241 trophy has been held in @entity266 , and @entity269 market the @entity267 heavily in other countries			0
" nevertheless there is a sense of inevitability about the previously mentioned 39th game that it will return to the agenda sometime soon			0
" for the @entity241 to compete with other sporting properties , it will be looking at overseas markets and how best to take advantage of the opportunities they potentially present			0
