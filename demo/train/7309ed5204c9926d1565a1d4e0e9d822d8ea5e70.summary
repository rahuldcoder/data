-- the @entity1 on thursday will graduate its most diverse class ever after decades of criticism and legal battles over the racial composition of its firefighting force			1
of the 242 probationary firefighters joining the ranks , 62 % are minorities			1
mayor @entity11 and fire commissioner @entity12 will preside over the ceremony			0
in the last 12 years , the fire department has doubled the number of minority firefighters , the city said in a statement			2
one year ago , a federal judge ordered @entity20 to pay $ 128 million to firefighters who claimed in court that the department 's entrance exam was deliberately designed to keep african - americans and @entity26 off the force			1
" it is a very important step , " said @entity28 , senior staff attorney for the @entity29 , which represented a group of black firefighters , referring to the latest graduating class			1
" it 's due almost entirely to the efforts of the @entity36 to make sure that the tests that the fire department used were fair			0
" last year 's ruling followed a lawsuit that alleged that the exams had little to do with firefighting and instead focused on cognitive and reading skills			1
because of the hereditary nature of the fire department , white candidates were recruited and supported throughout the application process by family or neighborhood contacts and whites consistently passed while minority candidates failed			0
@entity53 , a former president of the @entity36 , a group of black firefighters , praised racial makeup of the latest class			1
" we 've got to continue down this path , " he said			0
" we 've been assured a more fair testing procedure			0
we 've also made them increase their recruiting in neighborhoods of color but these have to continue ... we need a commissioner and a mayor who are committed to this if we want to see a bigger number of people of color coming onto the job			0
" the lack of minorities in @entity74 fire departments has been the focus of many lawsuits			2
the last available national figures , from the 2000 census , show 8.4 % of the nation 's firefighting forces to be black and 8.6 % to be @entity81			1
blacks are 12.2 % of the population ; @entity26 are roughly 16 %			2
however , other big cities have made much faster progress at diversifying their ranks			0
more than half of the @entity88 and @entity89 fire departments members are black or @entity81 .			0
