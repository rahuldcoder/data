-- @entity1 ran for president in 2008 on the " audacity of hope , " but " audacious " is hardly the first word that comes to mind in describing @entity7 politics these days			1
in a column after a trip to @entity14 in november , @entity11 wrote : " ( @entity15 ) he country that showed the world how to pull together to put a man on the moon and defeat @entity20 and @entity21 , today broadcasts a politics dominated by three phrases : ' you ca n't do that , ' ' it 's off the table ' and ' the president did n't know			1
' " in my view , at least , the further we fall the higher the potential for rising again			2
we can not continue to muddle through , because muddling through now means falling further and further behind			0
our greatest strength as a nation has been our capacity for perpetual renewal			0
as @entity37 shows in her splendid book " @entity39 , " we faced similar challenges of corrupt government , excessive concentration of power and a denial of equal opportunity to the majority of our citizens at the end of the 19th century			0
the progressive movement , born initially out of the @entity50 but ultimately drawing supporters from both parties , rose to the occasion			0
that change was fueled by a vibrant press and an entire set of new ideas that accompanied new technologies			2
big ideas about how to organize our government and ourselves , how to structure our economy , how to reform our educational system and our working conditions			1
we need a similar set of ideas today			2
that 's why the think tank and civic enterprise i lead , @entity70 , is trying to shift the national conversation toward a set of big ideas as blueprints for change			1
two big ideas strike at the heart of who we are as a nation and what we offer our citizens			1
@entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 call on @entity70 to " restore the second - chance economy			1
" @entity85 has always been one not only of upward mobility , but of the ability to fall and rise again			0
millions of @entity7 came to this country to reinvent themselves ; in the 19th and early 20th centuries , they could escape the stigma of bankruptcy or even a criminal conviction by heading out to the frontier			1
yet while " fail early and often " is a recipe for success in @entity97 , it is a death sentence , sometimes literally , for the majority of @entity7			1
credit histories and criminal records now follow citizens everywhere and forever , always accessible online			0
we need to end institutional practices that currently double down on disadvantage , while at the same time helping our citizens build assets and provide social insurance that will cushion them through the inevitable ups and downs of life			0
the idea of a second - chance economy should be built into the social contract between @entity7 and their government			1
in return for paying taxes , participating in elections and obeying the law , citizens should expect the government to invest in an infrastructure of both competition and care that enables them to reach their full potential as workers and human beings			0
in the 21st century , that should start with providing every citizen with universal high - speed internet -- as @entity132 and @entity133 put it -- " for everyone			2
" big ideas for a new @entity70 expand well beyond government policy , however			1
consider the future of @entity7 manufacturing , which @entity146 and @entity147 argue lies in " servitization , " the transformation of goods into packages of physical products attached to a stream of services			1
a @entity152 tractor , for instance , comes with an onboard computer that can steer itself , adjust levels of fertilizer , seed and water , and , most importantly , send a continual flow of data back to a 24 - hour service line that will in turn tell farmers how to increase productivity and when they need preventive maintenance			2
that service line , in turn , is staffed by information and analysis service providers , a huge and expanding category of jobs that will process data coming from virtually every " product " we use in our lives and work , all now connected to each other in the internet of things			0
at the same time , technology should n't become an impediment to the @entity7 birthright of the pursuit of happiness			1
we can increase productivity and at the same time , increase leisure			0
other big ideas worth considering include a smart plan to fix our political system : the answer for elections dominated by big donors is to make everyone a political donor			1
@entity195 and @entity196 outline the basic logic of this approach : " if politicians have a broad base of support , they will be far less dependent on the 0.01 percent , even if the big spenders still exist			2
" if the remedy for bad speech is more speech , our classic defense of the @entity209 , then the remedy for distorted democracy is more democracy			0
finally , consider the state of @entity7 education			1
amid all the justified hand - wringing over our schools , a revolution is about to take place in higher education			1
physical campuses will transform or combine with virtual platforms that provide lifelong learning from multiple sources with measurable outcomes			0
the key to this transformation , as @entity70 's @entity228 points out , is to start measuring education in terms of learning rather than time			2
the idea involves the redefinition or even abolition of " the credit hour			0
" we currently award degrees based on how many " credits " a student receives for a course , which in turn measures how much time he or she has sat in a classroom every week , whether that time was spent listening to the professor or surfing the @entity246			0
but students today , many of whom can expect to live to 100 or more , will learn what they need and want to know over a lifetime , in physical school , their workplaces , online and in the school of life			0
they will be able to prove that they have in fact gained the knowledge they need through a variety of certification measures , all of which will replace " credits " as we know them			0
it is so easy to be cynical , to think that talk is cheap and ideas are easy to promote but impossible to implement			2
i have a different view			0
inspiration can not take flight without ideas to power it			2
with inspiration , by contrast , comes a vision of genuine change and the energy , faith , commitment , determination and persistence to make it happen			0
if our politics are small , it is because our imagination is impoverished , strangled by the belief that nothing big can happen			1
if we start with ideas -- not just speeches , but real ideas -- the politics will follow .			1

@entity294 : @entity7 politics paralyzed , polarized and in " small - ball " mode
she says that should n't prevent us from pushing *ahead* with big new ideas
economy needs to give @entity7 a " second chance " to thrive , she says
@entity294 : education , manufacturing , campaign finance all need *rethinking*
