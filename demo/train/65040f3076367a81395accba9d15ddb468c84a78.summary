@entity0 -- the whole point of the founding of this country was that government was n't supposed be a family business , but we 've got dynasties nonetheless			1
the sixth @entity10 president , @entity9 , was the son of the second president ( @entity11 ) , after all			2
now there 's @entity13 , the much younger wife of octogenarian @entity14 , running for the seat he announced last week that he 'll leave after 58 years			2
that 's a record , by the way			2
there 's been a @entity14 on @entity20 every year since 1933 ... since @entity21 was president and there was a depression going on			2
that 's a much better record than the @entity25			0
there were two years -- between 2011 when rep. @entity27 resigned , and 2013 when rep. @entity28 was sworn in -- without a @entity27 on @entity20 or any elected office since 1947			1
so add the @entity30 , on a smaller scale , to the @entity32 and the @entity33			0
not a presidential cycle goes by without somebody talking about a @entity36 or a @entity38 running			1
it 's too much for one dynasty 's matriarch			0
" kennedys , @entity32 , @entity33 , there are just more families than that , " @entity42 said recently			1
that has n't stopped her son @entity38 , the former @entity48 governor , from teasing a bid for president and arguing his name would actually hurt him			1
" i get the point			0
it 's something that , if i run , i would have to overcome that			0
and so will @entity55 , by the way			0
let 's keep the same standards for everybody , " he said last week in @entity58			0
@entity38 might or might not run for president			1
but the @entity38 dynasty will live on			1
@entity38 's son , @entity64 , is the odds - on favorite to win in his campaign for @entity69 land commissioner this year			1
there are a lot of smaller political families in the 50 states			1
up on @entity20 , take the @entity74 , which has 100 members			0
a full third -- 33 of them -- are the father , son , mother , daughter , husband or wife of at least one other public official , according to a @entity1 analysis			1
there are @entity87 and @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92			0
in the @entity74 , politics is the family business why so many family names in @entity10 politics ? in recent years on @entity20 we 've seen @entity91 , @entity98 and @entity99 ; @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 ; and @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105			1
the brand alone wo n't win an election , but it brings instant name recognition			0
and in this era of big , expensive campaigns , name recognition can be priceless			0
some dynasties are harder to maintain than others			1
the @entity113 for @entity74 campaign did n't last long			2
and the attempt to reboot the @entity117 name foundered when former vice president @entity119 's son , @entity118 , lost his @entity121 seat after one term			0
and the @entity123 -- former sen. @entity125 's daughter , @entity124 , is a @entity126 running in a red state for the @entity74 seat in @entity129			2
so are the @entity130 -- former president @entity132 's grandson , @entity131 , is running for governor there			2
@entity1 's @entity135 contributed to this report .			0

politics is often a family business -- not exactly what the founding fathers *intended*
nonetheless , our country has a long *history* of political dynasties
the @entity27 , @entity38 , and @entity36 families are just a few of the political dynasties
the @entity152 have been in @entity153 since the @entity154
