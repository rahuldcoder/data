@entity0 -- there is a good chance @entity3 pressure will encourage @entity9 tyrant @entity8 to leave power , the @entity4 @entity3 commander told @entity11 tuesday , but the opposition that could come in the @entity9 leader 's wake has " flickers " of @entity16			1
while there is a wide range of possible outcomes in @entity9 , running from a static stalemate to @entity8 cracking , there is a " more than reasonable " chance of @entity8 leaving power , adm. @entity26 said before the @entity23 , but potential " flickers " of @entity16 and @entity32 elements have been seen in intelligence regarding the @entity9 opposition , which is poised to take power if @entity8 leaves , @entity26 said			1
however , he added there is no evidence of a significant presence of @entity16 or other terrorist groups			1
@entity26 is also the commander of @entity37			1
" the intelligence that i 'm receiving at this point makes me feel that the leadership that i 'm seeing are responsible men and women who are struggling against col. @entity8 , " @entity26 added			1
the comments come the same day as @entity4 secretary of state @entity44 met with a leader of @entity9 's opposition in @entity47			1
@entity48 and the heads of 40 other countries met tuesday to discuss @entity9 's future			2
a senior counterterrorism official , unnamed because he is not authorized to speak on the record , backed up @entity26 ' assessment , downplaying the concern about @entity16 among the @entity9 opposition			1
there is probably " a sprinkling of extremists to perhaps include @entity16 " in @entity9 among the rebels , " but no one should think the opposition is being led by @entity16 or one of its affiliates , " the official said			1
@entity16 has had a presence in @entity65 for years			1
it " would n't be surprising if small numbers -- a handful " -- of extremists or @entity16 are in @entity9			2
" it 's hard to tell who all the leaders are in the opposition , " the official said , but " the rebels do not appear to be adopting an @entity16 bent or ideology in @entity9			1
" if @entity8 's forces cease fighting there would be a series of decisions on how @entity3 should proceed			1
leading the senators through the @entity3 command chain , @entity26 said the intelligence and ground assessments would work their way up through @entity3 , first going through @entity88 gen. @entity87 leading the @entity3 operation in @entity9 , then up to @entity26 and eventually going up to the @entity90 for the ultimate decision on course of action , @entity26 said			2
" i think there would be actually another level that this discussion would have to go to , which would be the @entity90 since the authority for @entity3 to participate in this operation is under the @entity100 resolutions 1970 and 1973 , " @entity26 pointed out			2
during this process there would be a pause in @entity3 activity over @entity9			2
but for now the fight is still very much on			0
no - fly air zones have been set up to allow air assets to strike @entity9 forces if the civilian population is threatened , @entity26 said , going beyond a basic no - fly zone patrol mission			0
for the first time , @entity112 and ac - 130 ground attack aircraft were used over the weekend in @entity9 , vice adm. @entity111 said at a press briefing on monday			0
these aircraft fire machine gun rounds from cannons , up to thousands of rounds a minute , and due to their low - altitude flying ability provide more precision in densely populated areas			0
on monday night , one a- 10 aircraft attacked @entity9 coast guard ships in the port of @entity125 after reports were confirmed that the ships were firing at merchant vessels			0
@entity3 is set to take control of the full operation in @entity9 including protecting civilians on thursday , greatly easing the financial costs on the @entity4 , which has already hit $ 550 million as of monday , according to @entity134 figures			0
of those costs , 60 % were for munitions , the @entity134 said , including @entity138 missiles , which cost $ 1.4 million each			0
the @entity4 has launched approximately 200 since the beginning of the operation			0
" future costs are highly uncertain , " @entity134 spokeswoman @entity141			0
@entity144 said , but the @entity4 expects to incur another $ 40 million in costs over the next three weeks			0
after the transition to @entity3 control is complete , the @entity134 expects the cost of the @entity4 support operation to drop significantly , costing $ 40 million per each subsequent month			0
@entity1 's @entity149 contributed to this report			0

but no evidence of major presence , official says
he sees " more than reasonable " chance @entity8 will leave power
