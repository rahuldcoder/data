@entity0 , @entity1 -- sprawled out before us sits the exterior of the world 's biggest building by volume			2
" @entity13 see some airplanes ! " says our @entity12 tour guide			1
i remind myself : this does n't happen very often			2
yeah yeah yeah , @entity12 offers public tours of this 98.3 - acre airliner factory north of @entity19 every day			1
as part of a convention of aviation fans called @entity27 , we 're gaining ultra-exclusive access to the factory floor			1
the public tour is limited to the balcony			2
we 're about to walk knee - deep where @entity12 gives birth to some of the world 's biggest and most advanced airliners , including the 747 - 8 @entity37 , the @entity38 and the @entity39			1
but not so fast -- before we go inside , @entity12 has laid down some rules : no photos , no video , for our eyes only			1
here 's a painful development : our smartphones have been confiscated			2
i 'm already suffering from phantom phone pangs			2
we enter through a small , inconspicuous door marked @entity49			2
suddenly , we 're surrounded by partly assembled airliners in a room so big it takes on the feeling of an entire world			2
in some spots , we gaze across an unobstructed view measuring a quarter - mile			2
this building is so flippin ' big that -- years ago -- it created its own inside weather patterns , including vapor clouds			2
they eliminated that by installing a special ventilation system			2
today 's factory forecast : avgeeking , with continued avgeeking and a favorable chance of avgeeking later in the day			1
here are a few cool tidbits : @entity69 - dropping perspective the thrill of being so close to the planes literally stops you in your tracks			2
seemingly everywhere you look there 's another five - or six - story - tall airplane towering over you			2
some are covered with a green , protective temporary coating			2
one @entity39 tail is painted with the familiar @entity81 red , white and blue			1
another sports @entity84 @entity83 's cool black - and - white			2
@entity12 paints the tails before they 're attached to the planes			1
then they carefully adjust the tails for balance			2
paint adds hundreds of pounds of weight , which would ruin the plane 's balance if the tails were painted after being attached			2
soon these behemoths will jet across vast oceans as they carry travelers to far - flung destinations			2
' you 've got ta have secret clearance ' the planes ' huge fuselages are joined together with the help of a giant piece of equipment called a " saddle			2
" this u-shaped metal cage straddles the top of the planes during the body - joining process			2
the " @entity114 " area -- where workers attach wings to the planes -- is the loudest part of the entire facility			0
the staccato of rivet guns pierces the heavy air			0
whooshing vacuums suck up any dust that may be created when workers drill into the planes ' lightweight carbon composite material			0
security concerns in the plant are real			0
" conversation - restricted area , " says one sign			0
as we walk past a fenced - off zone , our guide quips , " you 've got ta have secret clearance			0
i ca n't even go in there ! " the rock star engine then , like a holy relic brought back from the @entity139 -- @entity12 lets us touch " it			1
" by " it " we mean the @entity142			0
@entity144 calls it the most powerful commercially produced jet engine in the world			0
we gather around this rock star engine like thirsty travelers at a desert oasis , each taking turns running our hands across its silver exterior			0
the lip of the engine 's mouth feels rough , like it has countless scratches etched into it			0
that design , engineers discovered , helps reduce noise			0
this 19,000 - pound monster hangs from the wing of a giant 777 , but the engine still looks humongous -- measuring more than 11 feet in diameter			1
in fact , @entity12 says it 's so big you could fit the body of a 737 airliner inside it			1
" there 's no way to sense the sheer size of an airplane without being right there underneath it , " says @entity175 contributor @entity173 , enjoying his first @entity176 like this make it possible for wide - body planes to fly long - distance routes nonstop with only two engines instead of three or four			0
in fact , the 777 flies many of the world 's longest nonstop routes			1
in 2005 it set the world distance record for a nonstop commercial airline flight , jetting 13,423 miles from @entity194 eastbound to @entity195 in 22 hours , 22 minutes			0
the world 's top flying hauler just a few hours earlier , a handful of aviation geeks were hanging out at a hotel next to @entity201 , the airport @entity12 uses to test and deliver the factory 's planes			1
then , @entity173 tweeted out that the plane that hauls the most cargo by volume in the world just happened to be passing through			0
soon , a dozen camera - wielding geeks are lined up outside the hotel to welcome the @entity212 -- a modified 747 -- as it lumbers in for a landing			1
" we 're gon na be late for breakfast , " says avgeek @entity215 as he snaps photo after photo			1
" but this is worth it			0
" the thing roars like a lion , but it looks like a whale as it slows for touchdown			0
in the entire world , there are only four of these giant planes			0
@entity12 uses them to ferry big sections of the 787 for final assembly here in @entity0			1
last year , when a @entity212 landed at the wrong airport in @entity237 , it was n't exactly a stellar moment			0
the @entity239 this is the fifth avgeek fest , co-sponsored by @entity241 and @entity0 's @entity242			1
the february convention drew a record 300 - plus participants from 18 different states and three countries			1
@entity247 and @entity249 engineer @entity248 , flew 8,000 miles from @entity250 , @entity251 , to see how " things are laid out " in the factory			1
@entity255 official @entity254 traveled 100 miles from @entity256			0
who are these people -- these avgeeks ? what defines them ? " it 's someone who always looks up in the sky when they hear a jet roar , " says @entity261 , 14 , who runs @entity262 out of his @entity265 , @entity264 , home			0
@entity261 was right there in the thick of the geeks with his camera when the @entity212 came calling			0
the event was born from an aviation - obsessed online community that uses social media to organize and share information			1
aviation news sites like @entity280 , @entity281 , @entity282 and @entity283 all share common friends , connections and interests			1
when news breaks , their informal social network sometimes challenges traditional news media			1
this month @entity281 and a few other aviation sites broke news about the hijacking of an @entity293 767 in @entity294 about 30 minutes before many " legacy " news organizations , says @entity281 founder and editor - in - chief @entity297			1
@entity12 's desire to connect with fans and fliers combined with the emerging power of the avgeek nation opened the doors to the exclusive @entity12 tours , @entity297 says			1
" @entity12 has increasingly realized how smart and educated about aviation avgeeks are			1
" baby boeings the following day southeast of @entity19 , @entity12 opens up yet another factory for us to tour			1
this one is the birthplace of what @entity144 calls the " most produced large commercial jet in aviation history " -- the 737			1
this is a tour for avgeeks and @entity318			0
" @entity319 love getting access to places that are off limits , " says @entity297			1
" it 's all about exclusivity			0
" here 's some 737 tour trivia : — this place creates 38 of the planes every month on a moving assembly line			1
and they 're pushing to increase that rate			0
" even though we joke that the 737 is the ' @entity12 , ' it 's still a large and complex machine , " says @entity173			1
" it requires precision to put it together			0
the fact that you can perform such precise work on a moving target -- i find that to be incredible			0
" — the facility receives pre-assembled fuselages by train from a factory in @entity346 , @entity237			1
— workers attach wings to the fuselages			0
it takes about nine hours to put wings on a 737			1
— the planes also get " winglets " — the tiny , upward pointing wings you see on the wingtips of 737s and other airliners			0
these doodads reduce drag on the plane and make it more fuel efficient — by about 4 %			0
— workers install seats on the planes by using a loading machine they call a " hay baler			0
" — in an operation called " high blow , " @entity12 tests each plane 's passenger cabin for possible leaks during pressurization			1
the procedure includes putting people inside the planes to listen for leaks			0
— each 737 is made up of 42 miles of wire and 394,000 separate parts — if there 's a problem on the assembly line , workers activate a purple flashing light -- alerting others that they need help			1
" blinking purple is bad for us here , " says @entity388 , a @entity12 senior manager			1
" if there 's something wrong , something does n't fit , we need to do something about that			0
" as the tour ends , we wind through an employee diner named for the @entity399 symbol @entity400 , and file back onto our bus			0
driving off the property , we spot a train loaded with brand new wingless 737 fuselages headed to the factory behind us			1
that triggers spontaneous applause and scattered whoops throughout the bus			0
well , you just ca n't get any geekier than that			0
" that is so cool , " i hear someone say			0
" yeah , " said someone else , " baby planes ! "			0
