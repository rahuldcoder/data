-- it is easy to be confused by the welter of headlines and selective excerpts that have been leaked from former defense secretary @entity6 ' upcoming book " duty : memoirs of a secretary at war			1
" ( i have not yet read the book			2
) @entity6 asserts president @entity12 lacked conviction about his own decision to put more troops in harm 's way in @entity18			1
as described in the @entity20 summary of the book in the @entity22 , @entity6 writes that the commander - in - chief was " skeptical if not outright convinced it would fail			1
" he also condemns what he saw as " suspicion and distrust of senior military officers by senior @entity29 officials — including the president and the vice president			0
" in one meeting about @entity18 in particular , @entity6 said that after listening to the president , he concluded , " the president does n't trust his commander , ca n't stand @entity36 , does n't believe in his own strategy and does n't consider the war to be his			1
" he is particularly brutal about vice president @entity39 , who @entity6 asserts " poisoned the well " against @entity42 military leaders , and who he says " has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades			1
" @entity46 also does n't mince words about top officials like former national security adviser @entity49 or key @entity12 adviser lt. gen. @entity51			1
at the same time , @entity6 commends @entity12 's intelligence and character , his decision to go after @entity55 , and in his concluding chapter , according to the @entity58 account of the book , as far as the president 's overall @entity18 strategy he writes , " i believe @entity12 was right in each one of these decisions			1
" he also has strong praise for former secretary of state @entity64 mixed in with his lengthy expressions of frustrations with others in the administration and in @entity69 , notably the dysfunctional crowd on @entity71			0
compounding the apparent dissonance within @entity6 ' narrative , there is another conflict to reconcile			1
@entity6 is a man known for bipartisanship , discretion and keeping his own counsel , and yet he is blasting a sitting president that he served , and revealing details of private and off - the - record exchanges without apparent regard for confidentiality , and in a manner that is sure to be politicized			1
it might be easy to dismiss his account — as some , seeking to defend the president , already have done on @entity89 and in the blogosphere — as so contradictory as to not be credible			0
but that would be a mistake			0
@entity6 is one of the most distinguished , most widely respected national security public servants the @entity42 has produced in half a century			1
in addition to running the @entity95 for both @entity12 and president @entity96 , he ran the @entity97 and was deputy national security adviser			1
he is exceptionally intelligent , committed and few can rival his experience or perspective			0
no , the contradictions in @entity6 ' comments do not invalidate them			1
rather , they illustrate important facts			0
in the first place , they reveal @entity69 and policy making as they are : very little is clear cut , and personalities and politics play as big a role in key decisions as do any objective analysis of the merits of any decision			0
people — including presidents and secretaries of defense — can be contradictory bundles of good and bad qualities , advocates for decisions that are both right and wrong			0
but on a deeper level , @entity6 ' narrative is conflicted because he is writing about issues , such as @entity18 , in which there were literally no good answers			1
perhaps , in the very first phases of our engagement there , there was a " best possible path			0
" we could have gone in , sought retribution for 9/11 , attacked and killed our attackers and then gotten out			0
the problem became our desire to reduce in a much more sweeping and lasting way the threat posed by @entity142 , the @entity143 , extremists and instability in the region			2
this led to a long - term commitment in a place where there were no long term " solutions " — indeed , the threats posed by extremists are problems that can not be " solved ; " they can only be reduced and managed , never eradicated			0
but once we were into @entity18 for anything but retaliation , we ended up debating two deeply flawed alternatives			2
either we committed significant numbers of troops indefinitely — which would be costly , politically unpopular and unlikely to succeed in doing anything but moving terrorists elsewhere			0
or we would pull out and the situation would return to the chaos the region , becoming once again a @entity166 dish for terror			2
as it turned out , we will end up demonstrating at great cost that neither approach could work			0
gates and the military were right that only an extended military presence could control our enemies on the ground			0
@entity39 and his allies were right that getting out sooner would have the same effect as getting out in the medium term			0
and both will soon see that in @entity18 — as in @entity180 today and in our @entity181 more broadly — our costly investment and that of our brave troops will not change the region for the better			1
indeed , right now it looks as if @entity18 and @entity180 are likely to end up worse than we found them , and the sway of @entity142 and extremists more widespread and powerful			2
all this is because before @entity6 and @entity12 got into office , a fundamentally wrong decision was made by their immediate predecessors			1
we overreacted to 9/11 , seeking not justice but to change the world and a volatile region in ways that were beyond our capabilities			0
and the battles and tensions revealed among good men and women in the @entity6 account and others being written of the recent past are the legacy of that watershed error			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity210 .			2

@entity210 : new book by @entity213 *criticizes* @entity12 , others
reports : @entity6 writes that @entity12 lacked conviction on own @entity18 policies
he says @entity6 also says @entity12 " right " on @entity18 strategy
@entity210 : @entity6 narrative *reflects* *intractable* problem of @entity42 overreach in region
