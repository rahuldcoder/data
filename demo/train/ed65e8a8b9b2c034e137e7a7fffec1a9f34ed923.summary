a statin can be a lifesaver if you 're at risk of heart disease , but some people who take the cholesterol - lowering drugs -- up to 20 percent , by some estimates -- have to stop because of muscle pain , the most common side effect			1
( nearly 30 million people filled a statin prescription in 2005 , according to the @entity12			0
statins include popular drugs such as @entity15 , @entity16 , and @entity17			0
) some patients who take statins to cut the cholesterol buildup in their arteries experience muscle pain			0
now a new study suggests that an over-the - counter dietary supplement sold at pharmacies and health - food stores may be a workable alternative for people who have statin - related muscle pain			1
it seems that when combined with diet and lifestyle changes , red yeast rice supplements can lower @entity34 , or bad cholesterol , levels by more than 20 percent without a substantial risk of muscle pain ( also known as myalgia ) , according to a study published monday in the @entity41			1
" for some people , especially if they 've had muscle aching , taking red yeast rice and making lifestyle changes can work as well as a statin , " says lead study author @entity42 , @entity43 , of @entity44 in @entity45			1
although these and other results are promising ( in a previous study led by @entity42 , a combination of red yeast rice and fish oil outperformed simvastatin , the generic version of @entity17 ) , people with high cholesterol should n't race to the vitamin store just yet			1
red yeast rice is " not a panacea for all people with statin - association myalgias , " @entity42 cautions			1
in some patients , the supplements may cause a recurrence of muscle pain , or other serious muscle problems that are more difficult to detect			0
@entity70 : myths and facts about cholesterol plus , consumers who buy red yeast rice off the shelf do n't necessarily know what they 're getting			2
the @entity78 does not regulate dietary supplements , and the contents and potency of red yeast rice pills have been shown to vary widely among manufacturers			1
some pills might even be dangerous : a 2008 analysis of red yeast rice products conducted by a supplement - industry watchdog group found a potentially toxic ingredient in 4 of out 10 brands -- one was the store brand of a major pharmacy chain			1
what is red yeast rice ? @entity42 and his colleagues studied 62 patients with high cholesterol who had to stop taking at least one statin because of muscle pain			1
half of the patients took six capsules of red yeast rice daily for six months , and the other half received identical placebo capsules			1
for the first three months , all of the patients also attended weekly meetings in which they were taught how to eat well , exercise , and maintain a healthy lifestyle			0
after three months , the ldl levels of those taking the active red yeast rice had declined 27 percent , on average , compared with 6 percent in the placebo group ; at six months the decline in the active group was still more than 21 percent			2
and only 2 of the 29 patients who took red yeast rice in the study developed myalgia -- a far smaller percentage than could have been expected had they tried another statin			1
but in a way , the study participants did try another statin			0
red yeast rice , which has been used in @entity130 medicine for hundreds of years , is derived from a fungus that grows on rice			1
it contains a series of compounds that slow the production of cholesterol in the liver			0
one of those compounds , @entity140 , is a naturally occurring form of lovastatin , the active ingredient in @entity140 , a brand - name statin that was approved by the @entity78 in 1987 and now available as a generic			0
@entity70 : heart attack prognosis may depend on what 's in your medicine cabinet in effect , red yeast rice is a low - dose lovastatin , which may explain why it can sometimes cause muscle pain in statin - intolerant patients , according to @entity42			1
at the same time , the reduction in @entity34 that the supplements provide ca n't be attributed solely to the @entity140 , says @entity42 , so there must be other cholesterol - lowering ingredients in red yeast rice			2
the patients in @entity42 's study received a dose of @entity140 roughly five times smaller than the typical lovastatin prescription , yet the reduction in their @entity34 levels was comparable to the average drop patients see on a statin			0
" clearly something else is having a powerful lipid - lowering effect , " says @entity42			0
although the patients ' lifestyle changes probably helped , the findings suggest that some of the other compounds found in red yeast rice may enhance the effects of the naturally occurring lovastatin			2
the researchers used a supplement manufactured by @entity183 , but @entity42 says he does n't endorse or recommend any particular brand of red yeast rice			2
the contents were analyzed before the beginning of the study , which was funded by the @entity45 and the @entity189			0
@entity42 and the other researchers did not report any financial conflicts of interest			0
red yeast rice supplements are not for everyone not all cardiologists are sold on the potential utility of red yeast rice			2
" despite the preliminary evidence that the average patient suffering from muscle pain might see some lipid - lowering without having the pain again , we 're not to ready to recommend red yeast rice to our patients , " says @entity198 , @entity43 , a cardiologist who runs a clinic for statin - related muscle complications at @entity201 , in @entity202 , @entity203			1
in an editorial accompanying @entity42 's study , dr. @entity198 notes that the incidence of muscle pain reported among the study participants taking red yeast rice ( about 7 percent ) could be artificially low			1
roughly half of the patients who experience muscle pain after starting a statin eventually begin to feel better as their bodies become accustomed to the drug , says dr. @entity198 , and that could have occurred in the study participants			0
@entity70 : in @entity226 , heart - healthy diets can be work more important , he adds , the majority of patients who experience statin - related myalgia never have pain			1
instead , they may experience muscle atrophy , weakness , and fatigue potentially serious side effects that the new study may have overlooked			0
( although side effects other than myalgia were n't formally tracked , there were " no significant adverse events " in the patients taking red yeast rice , @entity42 says			2
) @entity70 : are you cholesterol smart ? take this quiz red yeast rice is n't appropriate for everyone with high cholesterol , agrees @entity42			0
he says that people who have had a heart attack or who have significant blockages in their arteries due to atherosclerosis should not replace a statin or other medical therapy with red yeast rice , since statins are proven to reduce the risk of heart attack and death			1
" i do n't think it would be wise to ever consider using red yeast rice if you have a known heart problem , " @entity42 says			0
supplements not immune to safety concerns in fact , all people looking to lower their cholesterol levels should think twice before taking red yeast rice , @entity42 advises			2
red yeast rice is " quite a bit stronger " than other dietary supplements used to lower cholesterol , he says , and the market is poorly regulated			2
in 2008 , the supplement - industry watchdog group @entity278 analyzed 10 brands of capsules whose labels advertised 600 milligrams of red yeast rice			1
when the products were tested in a lab , however , they were found to contain wildly different amounts of lovastatin and other compounds			0
" there was a 100-fold difference from the lowest to the highest , " says @entity278 president @entity290			0
an unexpectedly large dose of lovastatin could cause serious side effects and could interact with other drugs			0
the uncertain lovastatin content of red yeast rice products have led to a long - running dispute between the manufacturers of the pills and the federal government			2
a decade ago , the @entity78 successfully sought to regulate a red yeast rice extract known as @entity304 , claiming that the lovastatin it contained made it an unapproved statin rather than a supplement			1
any red yeast product containing more than trace amounts of lovastatin can also be regulated ( and effectively banned ) by the @entity78 , but red yeast rice products containing monacolin @entity313 have remained on the market			1
and though the @entity78 does continues to monitor the industry -- in 2007 , the agency warned three manufacturers that their red yeast rice products were unapproved drugs the woolly marketplace for supplements should make consumers wary			1
" i would never , under any circumstances , suggest that someone take red yeast rice , " says dr. @entity198			0
" it 's not controlled , it 's not safe , and it has n't been approved by the @entity78 in such a way that it 's formulated to be consistent			0
" enter to win a monthly @entity329 from @entity330 @entity331 2009			0
