before opening your mouth , ask yourself , ' what do i really want ? ' " establish respect : " begin by clarifying your respect and your intent			1
help your boss understand that your intent is to provide a different viewpoint you feel will help achieve your mutual goal			1
" remain objective : " describe your concerns with facts first			2
do n't lead with your judgments or conclusions			0
start by describing in non-judgmental and objective terms the behaviors that are creating problems			0
