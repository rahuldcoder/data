-- the spectacular rise of @entity2 , the first @entity3 to achieve basketball stardom , has been utterly thrilling to witness			1
we 've watched with pride as he 's broken through stereotypes to prove that an @entity3 can play alongside -- and beat -- the best in the @entity10			2
and we 've been gratified by the way @entity2 's story has been embraced by the @entity14 public , with fans of all races cheering him on			1
but we 've also been reminded of the ugliness with which @entity18 have often been depicted in @entity14 culture			0
after @entity2 's 38 - point performance against the @entity23 on february 10 , @entity21 columnist @entity20 tweeted an offensive joke about @entity2 that played off stereotypes of @entity18 ' lack of masculinity			1
boxer @entity28 has asserted that " all the hype " around @entity2 is just " because he 's @entity3			1
" and after @entity31 snapped the @entity33 ' @entity2 - led seven - game winning streak , @entity30 posted a story with a headline that was an obvious @entity36 slur			1
@entity28 : ' @entity2 hype is based on race not talent ' stereotypes of @entity18 have been a staple of @entity14 popular culture since the 19th century , from newspaper cartoons of menacing , bucktoothed @entity44 to film characters like the evil dr. @entity46 and the bowing , pidgin - speaking @entity48			2
in contemporary @entity14 , @entity18 -- when they appear at all -- are generally depicted as comical foreigners with " ching - chong " accents , from exchange student @entity51 ( " what 's happening , hot stuff ? " ) in " @entity51 " to @entity55 , the stereotyped @entity56 restaurant owner in @entity58 's hit comedy " 2 @entity59			0
" @entity14 culture tells us , in short , that @entity2 should n't exist			2
every time he drives to the basket , he upends stereotypes of @entity18 as short , weak and nerdy			0
every time he talks to the media , he dispels the idea that all @entity3 are like foreigners speaking broken @entity66			2
throughout his career , @entity2 has endured racist taunts from opponents and fans			2
and he 's been overlooked repeatedly			0
after a spectacular high school career , no college offered him a scholarship			0
after he starred at @entity75 , no @entity10 team drafted him			0
he was dropped by @entity76 and @entity77 before landing on the @entity33 ' bench , and only got his shot when his team got desperate			0
is the ' @entity82 ' hype caused by race ? even as " @entity82 " gripped the nation , commentators and fellow players continued to play down @entity2 's talents			1
from the declarations that @entity2 was a " fluke " and a " flash in the pan " to @entity94 's grudging comment that @entity2 was " a testament to perseverance and hard work , " the message was clear : @entity3 - @entity14 do n't really belong on the basketball court			1
we 've heard again and again that " no one knew " how good @entity2 was , but let 's get real			2
@entity2 was overlooked because when people looked at him , they saw a stereotype , not a basketball star			2
as @entity2 led the @entity33 to victory after victory , i watched with giddy excitement , but also a sense of worry : what would happen when the inevitable loss came ? would the resentment captured in @entity28 's tweet rear its head ? sure enough , the night the @entity33 lost to the @entity31 , there was the offensive headline from @entity30			1
i imagine that many @entity3 got the same sinking feeling as i did : here is the moment where the media will turn on @entity2 , bringing back the racist stereotypes that have been held at bay by @entity2 's winning streak			1
to my surprise , something else happened			0
@entity30 quickly apologized , then announced that it had fired the author of the headline and suspended an anchor who had used the same phrase on the air			0
this was remarkable , because although certain kinds of racist attacks against african - americans in the media have become unacceptable , @entity133 rhetoric typically goes unpunished			0
asian - americans have become accustomed to having our protests against media stereotypes shrugged off and ignored			1
but on this one , @entity30 took quick action			1
@entity145 writer says slur was ' honest mistake ' @entity148 , of the popular blog @entity148 , wrote about this " @entity149			0
" slurs and stereotypes that would previously have been used with impunity were getting a good , hard look , and a major media outlet responded to @entity3 - @entity14 critics with a swiftness that would have been unimaginable a few weeks ago			2
we should n't romanticize this : @entity30 knows that @entity2 is the biggest story in sports right now , and it ca n't afford to alienate or offend those hungry for their daily dose of @entity2			1
but perhaps that 's precisely the point			0
@entity2 has become so big that simply by being himself -- an @entity3 , comfortable in his own skin , playing basketball brilliantly on the world 's biggest stage and enjoying himself as he does it -- he may be revolutionizing our culture			1
the @entity149 wo n't end racism , but it does mean that @entity3 will never be seen the same way again			1
editor 's note : an earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the origin of the phrase , " @entity149			0
" it was first used by @entity182 , not @entity148			0

@entity189 : @entity30 posted article about @entity2 with a headline that was obviously racist
**yu** : media stereotypes of @entity3 are frequently ignored and shrugged off
he says that even though @entity30 took quick action , it 's because @entity2 is a big story right now
**yu** : @entity2 's *success* wo n't end racism , but people will begin to see @entity3 *differently*
