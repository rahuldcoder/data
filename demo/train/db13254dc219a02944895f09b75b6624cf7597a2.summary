-- @entity2 's profession is driving for millions of dollars a year in @entity4 races , but his hobby is racing against amateurs on dirt tracks for trophies			1
@entity2 , 43 , started in go - carts when he was just 5 in @entity10 , @entity11 , 50 miles south of the @entity12			1
he rose through the ranks , winning the @entity15 championship in 1997 before moving to @entity4 two years later			2
he 's won three championships in @entity4 's top series -- the @entity18 -- and he 's a co-owner of his racing team			1
other drivers started calling him " smoke " because that 's what they saw coming from his tires as he steered aggressively through turns on asphalt tracks			1
while burning rubber wore down tire tread needed late in a race , it added to his reputation as one of the most competitive drivers , both behind the wheel and off the track			2
sponsors pay big bucks to display their logos on @entity2 's no. 14 car because they know millions will watch it speed around the big track hundreds of times in a single event , as many as three dozen weekends a year			1
his bad - boy antics , the fights and the words , make him stand out among dozens of other personalities in the sport			1
even the fans who boo him are watching			0
he shows up unshaven on race days in contrast to more polished drivers who are more careful with words and actions to avoid alienating sponsors and fans			2
winning , either on @entity4 's asphalt or unsanctioned dirt , is @entity2 's goal			1
as he sacrifices valuable tire tread for track cred , he also puts great passion into his non-paying hobby , carried out at the risk of his big - money professional driving			0
why one @entity4 champion loves dirt tracks " being on a dirt track a lot of times is like being on a gravel road , " @entity2 said in a 2006 interview			1
" if you go just a little bit too fast the car 's going to slide			0
if you hit the gas too hard , it spins the tires or kicks the rocks up			0
if you try to stop too fast , you skid , you lock up the brakes			0
that 's what makes driving on dirt more technical			0
" when he won a dirt track race in @entity88 last month , he tweeted to fans as if he 'd won the @entity90 : " if you have n't heard already , i ran my sprint car tonight and won ! felt great to run it again			0
was a 2nd place car but had a little luck : ) " that " little luck " was the driver of the lead car crashing			0
@entity2 was leading a 30 - lap dirt track race at @entity100 a year ago when his car flipped , breaking two bones in his right leg			2
it ended his @entity18 2013 season 15 races early , costing him and his sponsors a lot of money			0
the august 11 , 2013 , race at @entity110 , @entity111 , was the first start @entity2 missed in 521 @entity4 races since his 1999 debut at the @entity90			1
ironically , he missed @entity110 again this year because of a dirt track tragedy on saturday			0
@entity2 hits , kills driver at dirt - race track @entity2 hit and killed another driver , @entity118 , during a sprint car race at @entity120 in @entity121 , @entity111			2
video shows that @entity118 and @entity2 appeared to make contact coming out of a turn and @entity118 hit the wall and was knocked out of the race			1
@entity118 , 20 , then got out of his car and walked down the track toward the other racers , who had slowed for a yellow flag			0
@entity118 pointed a finger and appeared to be yelling			0
one car swerved to avoid him , but @entity2 's right - rear tire appears to hit him as he passes			1
" there are n't words to describe the sadness i feel about the accident that took the life of @entity118 , " @entity2 said in a written statement			2
why @entity2 is n't likely to face charges veteran race fans remember a rookie driver who jumped out of his car during a @entity4 race in 1999 after another driver spun his car into him in @entity145 , @entity146			1
@entity2 had traded bumps throughout the race with @entity150 , who had been his dirt - track rival before they both moved up to @entity4			1
but the last crash against the wall disabled @entity2 's car			1
@entity2 waited on the track for @entity150 to circle around under a caution flag			2
@entity2 threw his gloves at @entity150 's car , and jumped onto its right side while the car was still moving			1
@entity2 's run - ins with other drivers are legend , including after his car crashed with @entity165 at @entity167 's @entity166 in 2012			1
@entity2 waited in a driving lane on pit road for @entity165 's car to return to the track			1
@entity2 threw his helmet at @entity165 as the car sped by			2
he told reporters later that he does n't " enjoy getting mad like that			0
" @entity2 rushed after driver @entity176 on pit row after a @entity179 , @entity180 , race last year			2
he was angry that the younger @entity176 had blocked him from passing during a restart			0
@entity176 said he was just " racing hard " because he thought he could win			0
@entity2 has also had his angry moments with fans and the media			2
he was investigated , though never prosecuted , for an alleged assault against a female fan at @entity166 in 2002 , the year he won his first of three @entity4 championships			1
@entity4 officials fined @entity2 $ 10,000 and ordered him to get anger management counseling for hitting a photographer after a bad race at the @entity12 in 2002			1
@entity2 has removed himself from racing for the present in the aftermath of @entity118 's death			1
he will not compete in a dirt track race in @entity198 , @entity11 , next saturday as he had planned , the track announced monday			0
he has not yet decided if he will race in the next @entity18 event at @entity201 next sunday , his spokesman , @entity199 said monday			0
" he is grieving , and grief does n't have a timetable			0
" august was to have been a celebration for @entity2 , the first anniversary of the dirt track wreck that changed his life			2
he tweeted this message to fans a week ago : " 1yr ago today my life changed			0
thank you to everyone that worked so hard to get me back to where i 'm at today			0
