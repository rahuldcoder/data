-- to help answer some questions about this week 's @entity4 announcement regarding the legality of so - called cell phone jailbreaking , or the modification of the software that comes with iphones and other handsets that is designed not to be changed , we 've compiled the following list of frequently asked questions : what does the @entity4 's ruling mean ? the short answer is that jailbreaking your @entity16 or other mobile device will no longer violate a controversial federal copyright law called the @entity20 , or @entity20			1
bypassing a manufacturer 's protection mechanisms to allow " handsets to execute software applications " is now permitted			2
but in practice , the actual impact of that portion of the decision may be limited			0
how does it affect iphones specifically ? @entity31 exercises greater control of its hardware and software than most of its competitors			1
anyone remember last fall 's court - ordered permanent injunction that @entity31 won against @entity40 , which sold pcs with @entity42 pre-installed ? on the @entity16 , @entity31 restricts the software that can be loaded onto the device			1
applications can be downloaded through the @entity47 , and to be included in the @entity47 , the program has to be vetted and approved by @entity31			1
@entity31 says this maintains a high - quality user experience and weeds out malware			2
( an executive summed it up : " you and your family and friends can download applications from the store , and for the most part they do what you 'd expect , and they get onto your phone , and you get billed appropriately , and it all just works			2
" ) but if users want software that 's not permitted in the @entity47 -- @entity64 is a big one , and tethering is another -- they need to jailbreak their phone			1
that unlocks the file system , allowing apps to be added without @entity31 's permission			2
groups of software developers and individuals work to devise jailbreaking software for every new version of the @entity16 's operating system that is released			1
the best known is probably the @entity78 , which makes its software available at no cost			0
why do you say the practical impact of the @entity4 's decision is limited ? until this week , @entity31 has possessed the legal equivalent of a double - barreled shotgun , which would have permitted the company to file lawsuits accusing users ( or jailbreak software creators ) of violating both the @entity20 and breaching the contract in the form of the @entity92			1
now , thanks to the @entity4 , @entity31 's legal arsenal has been reduced to a single - barreled shotgun , the license agreement			1
but these amount to legal claims that the company could in theory pursue			0
in reality , @entity31 has never sued a single person for jailbreaking or distributing jailbreaking software			1
it 's never even threatened to do so , even after years have elapsed			0
translated : if @entity31 is n't going to sue the hundreds of thousands of customers merrily jailbreaking their iphones , or the active developer community abetting their theoretically illicit activities , it does n't matter what the caliber of their legal weaponry is			1
so why should we care ? we asked @entity113 , an attorney with the @entity114 , the @entity115 - based civil liberties group that successfully petitioned the @entity4 for the exception			2
here 's what she told us : " @entity31 's never sued jailbreakers , but they claim it violates the @entity20 , and thus there 's a legal cloud			1
if they were right , they could stop people from jailbreaking the phones , i.e. get an injunction			0
now , they ca n't			0
even if it violates contract law , they 'd have to sue , and all they could get would be a tiny bit of money			1
it greatly decreases any incentive they might have or develop to sue			0
and it takes injunction off the table			0
which means that the law will not , in the next three years , prevent people from jailbreaking their phones			2
" in addition , the possibility of punitive damages has been eliminated			0
what does @entity31 say ? our old friend @entity148 extracted a statement from @entity31 on monday , which says simply : " @entity31 's goal has always been to insure that our customers have a great experience with their @entity16 and we know that jailbreaking can severely degrade the experience			1
as we 've said before , the vast majority of customers do not jailbreak their iphones as this can violate the warranty and can cause the @entity16 to become unstable and not work reliably			1
" earlier , @entity31 had told the @entity4 it opposed @entity114 's request in part because the @entity47 process protected consumers , because @entity16 customers only license the software and do not own it , and that fair use should not allow circumvention			1
what was the @entity4 's reasoning ? on all the important counts , it agreed with the @entity114 it said , for instance , that " the amount of copyrighted work modified in a typical jailbreaking scenario is fewer than 50 bytes of code out of more than 8 million bytes , or approximately 1/160,000 of the copyrighted work as a whole			1
" the @entity181 administration had sided with @entity31			2
the @entity182 said that granting the exemption " might just as likely deter innovation by not allowing the developer to recoup its development costs and to be rewarded for its innovation			0
" a side note : the @entity4 also granted another exemption , which allows used handsets to be reprogrammed to enable use of the mobile phone on another network			1
why would i want to risk jailbreaking my @entity16 ? you might want to jailbreak your phone if there 's a piece of software you simply must have			1
but jailbreaking should probably be left to people who are technologically savvy -- after all , if something goes wrong , you 're on your own			0
the two big dangers to jailbreaking your phone are voiding your warranty , and not correctly following the instructions of whatever software program you 're using to do the jailbreak , which can lead to a unusable or " bricked " phone			1
taking a phone that 's been jailbroken into an @entity210 , or sending it to @entity31 's service center means they likely wo n't fix it because you 've violated your user agreement			1
this includes repairing something that is not software - related , like a cracked screen			0
you may be able to find an authorized repair center that would do it , but it 's still a risk			0
according to @entity31 , the company 's support department already receives " literally millions of reported instances of problems flowing from jailbroken phones			2
" in a letter to the @entity4 ( @entity226 ) opposing the new exemption , @entity31 warned that legitimizing the practice of jailbreaking would be a security risk for the devices and result in more malware being installed because the @entity47 's protections would be bypassed			1
so does @entity31 have to support jailbreaking ? nope			1
section 2 ( c ) of the @entity92 ( @entity226 ) bans any attempt to " modify " the @entity16 software or to reverse - engineer it			2
what that means is that @entity31 can still legally -- if it chooses -- protect its phones from jailbreaking			2
the contract formed between the user and @entity31 ( and the user and the wireless carrier ) when the @entity16 owner agrees to the user licensing agreement is binding , says @entity248 , a senior fellow with the @entity249 who takes an expansive view of copyright law			1
just because the @entity20 allows individuals an exemption to jailbreak their own phones , " it does n't mean @entity31 or a carrier ca n't protect contractual restrictions to deal with it , " @entity248 said			2
" essentially the exemption says this is the sort of thing that falls in bounds of contracts			0
" @entity31 could pursue breach of contract if someone jailbreaks their phone , or they could sue a person or company that creates jailbreak software for inducing someone to breach their contract with @entity31			1
in other words , @entity248 said , " even if there was no @entity20 , you could still be bound not to circumvent that technological protection			0
" what does the @entity20 do , exactly ? check out section 1201 of the text of the 1998 law			0
part 1 says that , in general , " no person shall circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access " to a copyrighted work , including a computer program			0
part 2 says that " no person shall manufacture , import , offer to the public , provide , or otherwise traffic " in any software that allows such circumvention			0
( note this restriction has little impact on overseas software developers			0
) but there 's an important caveat to the first part			0
the @entity304 is charged with evaluating the @entity20 's impact every three years and adding exemptions on behalf of @entity307 who want to make " noninfringing uses " of copyrighted works			0
the last round of exemptions , for instance , said it 's officially legal to " unlock " your cell phone 's firmware if you 're hoping to switch carriers while continuing to use the same device			0
so how does this week 's @entity20 announcement benefit consumers ? while it does n't completely remove all legal repercussions from users who want to jailbreak their own phone , losing the protection of the @entity20 was a blow to @entity31 and other phone makers with proprietary software , according to @entity328 , co-director of @entity329 at @entity329			1
" it is an uphill battle now for @entity31			2
what this does is kind of shifts things in favor of users , " said @entity332			0
" if @entity31 goes to court they have to explain to a judge why the copyright office is wrong ( in this case ) or why other laws should trump copyright laws			2
" " another way to say it is the @entity20 was @entity31 's strongest weapon in controlling the @entity16 platform			1
( losing that exemption ) is like losing your best player on the team , " he said			0

@entity4 says jailbreaking your @entity16 no longer violates copyright law
if if users want software not in the @entity47 , they need to jailbreak their phone
but @entity31 could pursue breach of contract if someone jailbreaks their phone
