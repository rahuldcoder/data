-- behind the state banquet and smiles from @entity3 and @entity5 prime minister @entity4 , @entity7 's visit to @entity8 this week caused a wave of dissent			1
the @entity5 political elite boycotted events			2
the @entity5 foreign secretary pulled out of a meeting with his @entity18 counterpart to be with his new adopted son			1
and just days before he arrived , the @entity18 king accused @entity5 officials of ignoring information that could have averted the terror attacks in @entity8 on july 2005			1
whether the politics of the event were a success is open to debate			0
but this was just part of the story			0
the @entity18 were also in town to cement a strong trading and business relationship that has developed between the two @entity33 over the last 20 years			2
@entity18 is the @entity5 's largest trading partner in the @entity34			1
and behind the @entity35 , the @entity5 is the second largest foreign investor in the @entity37			1
@entity38 has designated @entity18 one of its 17 " @entity40 " along with @entity41 and @entity42 in the region			2
as the nation diversifies its economy away from oil , commercial opportunities for @entity5 thrive in a variety of sectors			2
@entity18 is currently planning six privately - developed economic cities			0
the $ 26.6 billion @entity51 -- the largest of these -- will create one million jobs and home to two million residents			0
the aim , says the @entity56 , is to boost the economy by creating a pro-business environment , and attracting investors and fostering investment opportunities			0
the @entity5 has , since the early 1990s , been one of the top five exporters to @entity18 , behind @entity35 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65			1
in 2007 , @entity18 bank @entity66 predicts that @entity5 exports to the @entity37 will increase by more than 5.5 per cent to reach $ 2.8 billion			1
while the balance of trade continues to be favor of the @entity5 , @entity18 's exports to @entity5 are also gaining ground and closing the trade gap			1
this year , exports to @entity5 are expected to reach a record high of $ 2.1 billion , says @entity66			1
and this is n't all about oil			0
in the 1980s , three quarters of @entity18 exports to the @entity5 were from oil , but today the non-oil sector accounts for 59 percent of exports			1
products being shipped to the @entity5 include machinery , transport equipment , plastics , non-metallic minerals and , despite the @entity5 's dominance in the sector , chemicals			1
according to @entity66 , there are also more than 150 @entity18 - @entity5 joint ventures underway with a value of around $ 15 billion			1
as @entity95 , chief economist from @entity66 says , state visits such as this are important for bolstering trade talks , past and future			0
" the biggest deal that will mark their relationship in trade is the purchase of 72 @entity103 that was sealed last week , " says @entity95			0
the contract between the @entity37 and the @entity5 @entity105 via @entity106 is worth over almost $ 10 billion for the aircraft alone and a further $ 19 billion for the deployment , maintenance and training			1
this comes less than a year after the @entity5 government decided to call off a @entity114 investigation into defense contracts with @entity18			2
this probe related to the sale of weapons by @entity106 to @entity18 in the 1980s			0
@entity106 has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and making payments to @entity18 royals to win business			0
but as @entity95 points out , any political sensitivity surrounding the visit is unlikely to harm future trading relationships between the nations			0
" the relationship is far deeper than that , " he says			0
" @entity18 's economy is booming and the opportunities businessmen see here are immense			2
everything else takes a subsidiary part in that			0
