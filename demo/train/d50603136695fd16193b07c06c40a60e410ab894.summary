-- let 's be clear : @entity3 's latest operation in @entity4 is not about security			1
cease - fires between @entity7 - ruled @entity4 and @entity3 have brought security for months on end and there is ample evidence to show that @entity3 is largely responsible for truce breakdowns			1
@entity3 decided to escalate the conflict last wednesday with its assassination of @entity7 leader @entity15 despite a truce that had been observed by all @entity18 factions during the previous two days			2
read more on @entity19 and even though they knew that @entity15 had just received a proposal for a permanent truce agreement with @entity3 , as revealed in @entity23			0
some analysts have tied @entity3 's latest operation to the forthcoming elections , a way of cementing victory for @entity29			1
previous prime ministers have tried it , and failed			0
@entity29 had previously avoided such operations but he seems to have succumbed , although events can spiral out of his control , as @entity7 hits near @entity35 and @entity36 have shown			0
but at the end of the day , the loss of @entity18 lives will far exceed that of @entity3			2
during @entity3 's last major operation against @entity4 , the devastating three - week assault it launched on december 27 , 2008 despite a cease - fire that had held for months , nearly 1,400 @entity18 were killed and thousands injured , compared to 13 @entity3 ( four from friendly fire			1
) in the present attacks , more than 100 palestinians and three @entity3 have been killed so far			0
@entity0 poll : 57 % of @entity49 say @entity3 attacks in @entity4 are justified the loss of life in armed conflict is always tragic , and much more so when those lives could have been spared by a cease - fire			1
what is particularly heartbreaking about the population in @entity4 , against the backdrop of broader @entity18 dispossession , is that they have nowhere to run			2
@entity61 : share your images but stay safe			0
@entity3 's blockade is now into its seventh year , while the new @entity66 government has not yet significantly opened @entity4 's only @entity68 border crossing at @entity69			1
there are arguably two other factors behind @entity3 's new operation			2
one is deterrence , as @entity74 , an @entity3 colonel emphasized in the @entity75 : " deterrence has to be maintained			0
it was only a question of time until this moment arrived			0
" put differently , @entity3 will ignore any cease - fire at will			1
blogger @entity81 recalls his conversation with an @entity3 military expert shortly after @entity85 who said that @entity3 deliberately provoked @entity7 rocket fire so it could do a little " spring cleaning " and deplete @entity7 's weapons			2
he said this happened every few years			0
and here we are , four years on			0
the second reason for the attacks on @entity4 is that @entity3 may be testing the boundaries of the changes brought about by the @entity97 uprisings to see just how far it can push the @entity49 , @entity66 , and the @entity18 leadership			1
read related : how @entity99 has changed since last @entity4 conflict there is clearly no change from the @entity49 , whose spokespersons unquestioningly supported @entity3 's right to " self - defense			1
" by contrast , @entity66 's @entity107 unreservedly condemned the attack , sending his prime minister and other officials to @entity4 to effectively serve as human shields : an @entity3 attack on the officials would have meant a real rupture with @entity66			2
the signals from the @entity116 ( @entity116 ) have been mixed			0
@entity116 security forces have brutally cracked down on some of the demonstrations protesting @entity3 's assault on @entity4 as part of their security coordination with @entity3			1
at the same time , @entity116 head @entity123 has been urging @entity97 and international action to bring about an end to the fighting and speaking of reconciliation between @entity128 and @entity7			0
with the impending bid to upgrade the status of the @entity18 territories at the @entity132 to that of non-member observer state , the @entity116 and the @entity135 ( @entity135 ) can not abandon @entity4 to its fate			2
this is a sharp reversal of @entity135 behavior during @entity85 in 2009 , when it resisted attempts to bring about an immediate cease - fire so as to please the @entity49 -- so much so that the then - president of the @entity143 , the @entity145 priest father @entity144 , effectively accused them of complicity though without naming names			1
read latest : reports from @entity0 on the ground in the @entity4 - @entity3 conflict four years on , the @entity135 / @entity116 has little faith in the @entity49 commitment to a two - state solution and none in @entity3 's			1
in any case , the @entity135 / @entity116 can not afford to be seen to be less pro-palestinian than @entity66			0
even the @entity49 may not be able to completely ignore @entity97 sentiments in an era of disappearing dictatorships			0
what is needed now is an immediate cease - fire , pushed by @entity18 and @entity97 leaders and supported by the international community , whether @entity3 wants it or not			1
it is imperative to end the bloodshed now , and then work for a just peace that will end it for all time .			0

@entity18 *political* analyst : " @entity3 largely responsible for truce breakdowns *[* with @entity4 *]* "
@entity173 : @entity3 's new operations could be *motivated* by forthcoming @entity3 elections
@entity3 could also be looking to maintain a deterrence , says @entity173
" what is needed now is an immediate cease - fire , " @entity173 says
