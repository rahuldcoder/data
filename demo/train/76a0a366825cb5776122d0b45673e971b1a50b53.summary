@entity0 -- the @entity2 voted thursday to kill a controversial proposal pushed by republicans that would have allowed employers to opt out of providing health care coverage they disagree with on moral grounds			1
by a 51 - 48 mostly party line vote , the motion by @entity12 to table the amendment succeeded , effectively killing it			2
three @entity12 joined @entity4 in opposing the tabling motion , while one @entity4 -- retiring moderate sen. @entity17 of @entity18 -- voted with @entity12 in favor			2
the so - called " conscience " amendment , sponsored by sen. @entity21 of @entity22 , was the @entity25 ' response to the simmering controversy over a recent @entity28 administration decision to mandate the kind of health care coverage provided by religious employers			1
" this bill would just simply say that those health care providers do n't have to follow that mandate if it violates their faith principles , " stated an early february press release from @entity21			1
" this is about the @entity38			0
it 's about religious beliefs			2
it 's not about any one issue			0
" the specific potential impact of the amendment was a matter of debate			0
on his website , @entity21 rejected complaints that it would have allowed anyone to deny coverage of anything for any reason			1
however , @entity12 insisted it would provide too much latitude for employers to impose their personal beliefs on the healthcare issues of their workers			2
" it would simply give every boss in @entity62 the right to make health care decisions for their workers and their families , " argued sen. @entity59 , @entity60			1
she and other @entity12 said that under the amendment , employers could have cited moral objections to cutting off coverage of immunizations , prenatal care for children of unmarried parents and other standard procedures			1
the @entity75 applauded the @entity2 vote			1
" the @entity78 and its supporters are out of touch with reality , " said @entity77 , the @entity75 policy counsel			2
" overwhelmingly , women from every religious background use contraception to protect their health and plan their families and lives			2
the @entity2 did the right thing by @entity62 women today			2
" while @entity21 's amendment took a broad approach , the main issue involved whether religious employers should have to include coverage for contraception in health plans offered to employees at affiliated institutions , such as hospitals			1
earlier this month , secretary of health and human services @entity100 issued a directive that would have required all employers , including religious organizations , to include such coverage in health insurance offered to their employees			1
while churches were exempt , the mandate covered religious affiliated institutions			0
representatives from many faiths opposed the decision , calling it a violation of their religious conscience			0
in response to the uproar , the @entity117 backed off the directive and instead said that religious employers could opt out of offering coverage for birth control , but insurance companies would have to offer such coverage separately and at no charge			1
some critics say the @entity117 's changed position does not go far enough			0
@entity21 's amendment stated the president 's health care law , the @entity128 , imposes requirements that infringe on the rights and conscience of insurers and plan sponsors			1
while the law exempts some religious groups , it does not allow all those with religious or moral objections to decline providing coverage , the amendment says			1
part of the uproar surrounded universities and hospitals affiliated with religions , which were not given the same exemptions as churches and other religious institutions			0
the @entity21 amendment would have established that an entity refusing coverage on religious or moral grounds is not in violation of the law			1
it did not mention contraception specifically and included health insurance companies			0
to get a vote on the @entity21 amendment , it was tacked onto a $ 109 billion transportation bill , raising complaints from senate majority leader @entity161 , @entity162 , that the proposal was not germane to the legislation			1
because of the dispute , action stalled on the transportation bill , which is backed by both parties			0
@entity161 said tuesday that @entity2 minority leader @entity169 , @entity170 , insisted on a floor vote on the @entity21 amendment " before we can move ahead with this jobs bill			1
" " once we have put this extreme and distracting proposal behind us , i hope my @entity4 colleagues will stop living in the past and join us this year , 2012 , and help us create jobs , " @entity161 said			0
@entity21 welcomed the vote by tweeting , " glad sen. @entity161 is going to allow a vote on my bipartisan admt to protect religious freedom this thursday			1
" voting on the amendment forced senators to take a stand on the controversial contraception decision			0
though many @entity4 have come out in support of the measure , @entity17 told @entity190 the amendment is " much broader than i could support			2
" not all democrats were united against the amendment , however			0
sen. @entity194 , @entity195 , issued a statement wednesday saying he would support it			0
" i am voting in favor of this measure to protect the @entity38 , " @entity194 said in a statement			0
a @entity1 / @entity202 poll earlier this month showed a partisan divide on the issue , with 70 % of @entity12 agreeing with the @entity28 administration policy while 85 % of @entity4 opposed it			0
@entity1 's @entity207 contributed to this report .			0
