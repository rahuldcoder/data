@entity0 -- video showing a naked man being sprayed by an aid worker , apparently as part of a medical treatment and in full view of other migrants on the @entity10 island of @entity11 , has sparked outrage in @entity13			1
the secretly filed cellphone footage , aired on @entity10 state television channel @entity15 , shows a worker at a migrant center spraying the man while others wait for what officials said was a medical treatment designed to prevent a contagious skin condition called scabies			1
while the camp manager told @entity1 on wednesday that the video is misleading , the speaker for @entity10 's lower house of @entity28 , @entity29 , said in a post on the body 's facebook page that the reported treatment of migrants was " degrading " and " not worthy of a civilized country			1
" " those images can not leave us indifferent , " said @entity29 , who was the spokeswoman for several years for the @entity37 refugee agency in @entity0			0
she said efforts would be made to find those responsible and hold them accountable			0
the @entity10 @entity43 ordered an inquiry tuesday and said it expected a report from the local authorities within 24 hours			2
@entity49 home affairs commissioner @entity48 condemned the images -- reportedly shot by a migrant at the camp -- as " appalling and unacceptable			1
" she said the @entity53 would ask the @entity10 authorities to " shed full light " over what had happened			2
" we have already started investigations on the deplorable conditions in many @entity10 detention centers , including @entity11 , and we will not hesitate to launch an infringement procedure to make sure @entity49 standards and obligations are fully respected , " she said in a statement wednesday			1
" our assistance and support to the @entity10 authorities in managing migratory flows can only be continued if the country guarantees humane and dignified reception conditions to migrants , asylum seekers and refugees			1
" camp manager @entity73 told @entity1 wednesday that accusations that camp staff were humiliating migrants were offensive			1
" we are aware of what the video shows , " @entity73 said			2
" but that is not exactly how things work and what really happened			0
" usually , he said , migrants are given a preventative treatment for scabies inside showers contained in an enclosed cabin where greater privacy can be afforded			2
they are then given clean clothes to wear , @entity73 said			0
but he said on the day the video was shot , which he said was december 13 , migrants tired of standing in line began removing their clothes before getting inside the cabin			1
some asked for the treatment to be done in the open to speed up the process			0
" in retrospect we should have stopped the treatment that day , " he said			0
" but at the prospect of either hypothetically breaching the law for omitting to give health assistance to a refugee or hypothetically breaching his / her right to privacy , i opted for the second one			0
" shipwreck deaths @entity11 made global headlines when more than 300 @entity112 migrants died after their ship sank off its shores on october 3			1
days later , another 34 people died when their boat capsized			0
hundreds more have been rescued from often unseaworthy vessels and taken to the tiny @entity121 island 's overcrowded detention center			2
as the closest @entity10 island to @entity112 , @entity11 is a frequent destination for refugees seeking to enter @entity49 countries and shipwrecks off its shores are common			1
many of the migrants are from @entity112 nations , while others have fled war - torn @entity132 , officials say			0
the @entity10 coast guard told @entity1 in september that there were some 1,250 migrants in residence , in a space designed for 250			2
in the wake of the october tragedy , the @entity37 refugee agency called on @entity10 urgently to renovate the @entity11 detention center			1
the agency 's @entity0 - based representative , @entity143 , said the center 's capacity had been reduced from 850 to 250 by a fire in 2011 and had yet to be restored			0
" the serious degradation of the reception center , with entire families forced to sleep in the open when it rains , is absolutely unacceptable , " he said			0
he described conditions and services there as below @entity49 standards and urged @entity10 to speed up the transfer of migrants and asylum seekers to better equipped centers on the mainland			1
@entity1 's @entity161 reported from @entity0 and @entity162 wrote and reported in @entity163			0
@entity1 's @entity164 contributed to this report .			0
