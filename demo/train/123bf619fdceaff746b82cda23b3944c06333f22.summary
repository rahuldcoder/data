-- @entity2 's @entity1 was n't the first superhero with bad habits and a bad attitude			1
@entity6 , the protagonist of " @entity7 : the @entity7 , " has a bit of the devil in him : his skin is red ; he has two shorn - off horns on his head , a gargantuan club fist and a long , slippery tail			1
@entity17 returns in the title role in " @entity7 : the @entity7			1
" he also has a down - to - earth side : a fondness for @entity23 cigars , @entity25 beer , tv and candy			2
he has a short fuse and he 'd like a little appreciation for his efforts , please			0
he deserves it , too			0
this rank outsider is n't a billionaire like @entity34 or @entity35			0
he 's not even a scientist like @entity37			2
he 's more of a working stiff , a slugger with a gruff manner and a stogie in the side of his mouth -- but he wants to bat for the right team			2
( according to writer - artist @entity46 , the character was inspired by his father , a cabinetmaker			1
) hellboy -- or " @entity49 " to his friends -- has switched studios since his 2004 big - screen debut , from @entity53 to @entity54			2
writer - director @entity56 is still pulling the strings , and the key creative personnel are all back , including @entity17 in the title role , @entity60 as the pyrokinetic @entity61 ( now mrs. hellboy ) , @entity63 as the piscine @entity64 ( the brains to @entity49 's brawn ) , and -- behind the scenes -- cinematographer @entity68 , and art whizzes @entity70 and @entity71			1
between them , they conjure up one hell of a creature feature			0
" @entity7 " boasts a dazzling multitude of imaginary beings : the deceptively delicate tooth fairies ( so called because they eat bone , with a fondness for teeth in particular ) ; the elfin king whose antlers grow out of his head to form a crown ; the plantlike forest god that collapses into a strangely beautiful floral mulch right under the @entity87 ; the magnificent @entity88 , an old crone who unfurls her wings to reveal a sparkling set of eyes ( an avian variation on the creepiest creation in the acclaimed " @entity95 , " del @entity56 's last movie )			1
then there 's the redoubtable @entity98 , an officious but in many ways admirable @entity100 who only exists as a vapor trail -- except when he 's bottled up in an ingeniously modified , but still splendidly archaic , deep - sea diving suit			1
when a filmmaker can invest even a puff of smoke with so much chutzpah you know he 's on to something			2
it 's wonderful to see del @entity56 let his imagination run rampant like this			1
ireport.com : did you see " @entity7 " ? share your review the plot concerns an ancient race that 's determined to wage war on humanity , but it 's secondary to del @entity56 's amazing characters			1
the @entity25 director 's first @entity124 movies ( " mimic " and " @entity126 " ) were far less distinctive than his spanish - language films : " @entity128 , " " @entity129 " and " @entity95			1
" you could n't really call " @entity7 " an advance on the latter -- " @entity136 's " was nominated for six @entity132 and won three -- but it 's obvious he relishes this material			2
it 's pulpy and hammy and unashamedly lowbrow , and @entity138 has the confidence and power to make it his own			0
the film feels very free , loose and ( unusually for a special - effects picture ) improvisational			0
an outsize personality such as @entity17 is in his element here			1
even when the wisecracks fall short -- there are an awful lot of " ass " gags -- they are closer to the grubby , subversive impulses of the comic books than the over-hyped , market - tested , industrial - strength blockbuster adaptations @entity124 churns out			0
it 's not for nothing that the central tension running through this movie is @entity49 's anarchic streak , his sometimes irresponsible need to be his own man in the @entity162 ( the " x-men " - like institution where he works ) and in his marriage			1
scratch the surface , and this is a film about love and loyalty , figuring out where your deepest bonds lie			0
@entity170 may damn " @entity7 " as a " comic book movie , " though even they would have to grant that its wonderful idiosyncrasies indicate brilliance			0
but it 's more than that			0
hellboy does so much growing up over the course of these 110 minutes , we may have to call him " @entity180 " from now on			0
let 's hope @entity54 stays the course and gives us that opportunity			0
people as creative as del @entity56 and his gang need all the support we can give them			1
" @entity7 : the @entity7 " is rated @entity187 and runs 110 minutes			0
for @entity189 's take , click here .			0

@entity0 's @entity6 " shows more @entity56 brilliance
@entity17 is back as the cigar - *chomping* title character
plot is secondary to amazing characters , including a vaporous mass
