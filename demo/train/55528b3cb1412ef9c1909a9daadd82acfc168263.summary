-- the @entity1 and its allies face a variety of risks in taking direct military action against @entity6 over allegations that it used chemical weapons against civilians , including more poison gas attacks and retaliation against @entity1 interests			1
those warnings come from experts in chemical weapons and veteran @entity18 analysts , some of whom say @entity21 faces no good choices in confronting embattled @entity6 leader @entity23			1
missile strikes on @entity6 military command bunkers , airfields or the artillery batteries and rocket launchers used to fire chemical projectiles are among the options @entity1 officials say are under consideration			1
but there is no indication that the missiles would target stockpiles of chemical weapons -- something @entity39 , a former commander of the @entity42 military 's chemical defense regiment , called " the worst possible option			2
" @entity6 : how did we get here ? " if the missile and the explosive are big enough , they will , of course , destroy it , " de @entity39 said			0
" however , there will be a downwind hazard , and those people in the vicinity -- and it 's very difficult to say how far , but certainly a kilometer or so -- are likely going to suffer and become casualties from the fallout of those exploding chemical weapons			2
" and any attack on @entity6 might encourage @entity23 to order more chemical attacks on rebel forces and civilians in opposition - held areas , said @entity65 , a researcher at the @entity66 in @entity21			2
@entity6 ' a 10 - year issue , ' @entity1 general says " not doing anything tells @entity23 he 's not going to get punished , go out and use the chemicals , " said @entity65 , who has studied chemical and biological weapons for two decades			1
" striking the chemical sites presents a very real risk of releasing toxic chemicals over nearby civilian populations			0
not striking the chemical sites leaves @entity23 with potent weapons in his hands that he 's shown he 's willing to use			0
" striking other military targets leaves " a very ticked - off despot that is now perhaps even more tempted to use his chemical arsenal , " she said			0
" he 's already been punished for it			0
" that might convince @entity23 to go out " in a blaze of glory -- or in this case , infamy			0
" ' red line ' debate : are chemical weapons worse than attacks ? @entity94 , a professor of @entity18 history at the @entity96 , said the kind of intervention being discussed is n't likely to affect the balance of power in the 2 - year - old @entity6 conflict beyond providing a psychological boost to the rebels , who have suffered battlefield setbacks over the summer			1
" this is more about @entity21 saving face , it seems to me , than it is a consequential intervention in the @entity6 conflict , " @entity94 said , adding , " when you 're in a position where it is assumed that the @entity1 must do something , a couple of @entity111 make a statement			1
" the war " is being fought in alleyways and at close quarters , with artillery and tanks inside cities , " he said			0
missile strikes from distant warships or aircraft would n't be able to knock out enough of those weapons to make a difference without inflicting extensive civilian losses , he said			0
opinion : @entity6 ' a problem from hell ' @entity6 has admitted to possessing chemical weapons but has denied using them , saying its troops were the victims of rebel attacks			1
@entity138 inspectors are now in @entity6 to investigate whether the reported deaths of hundreds of people outside @entity141 a week ago was the result of a chemical attack			2
but @entity1 vice president @entity144 said tuesday there was " no doubt " government troops used chemical weapons on civilians			1
the @entity1 has already demanded that @entity23 cede power and is supporting @entity6 's opposition , but the possible @entity1 strikes are not about removing him , @entity151 spokesman @entity150 said tuesday			1
" they are about responding to a clear violation of an international standard that prohibits the use of chemical weapons , " @entity150 said			1
opinion : why @entity162 intervention in @entity6 will leave chaos @entity6 's civil war is already spilling over the borders of its neighbors in the form of bombings and refugees and is widely seen as a proxy war among different regional powers			0
@entity94 said @entity23 's government might try to strike back by targeting @entity1 military , diplomatic or commercial interests in the @entity18 , perhaps employing its allies in the @entity177 militia @entity176 -- which has a long and bloody track record targeting @entity1 during @entity177 's long civil war			0
" if @entity21 bombs things in @entity6 , i would n't want to be an @entity1 in @entity181 within reaching distance of @entity176 , " he said			1
" you could see a return to 1980s types of things happening , when our embassy was blown up in @entity181 and our @entity190 station chief was kidnapped and killed in the woods			0
" both @entity192 and @entity65 said a better course of action might be to start supplying @entity6 with the means to defend themselves against chemical attack			2
that means distributing masks , detectors and drugs used to treat patients exposed to nerve gas and training @entity6 how to use them			2
what justifies intervening if @entity6 uses chemical weapons ? @entity65 said those supplies and training could be provided by numerous countries , whose militaries are trained in chemical defense , and rushed into the field by aid agencies and opposition groups , possibly via neighboring @entity215			1
it could be done " very quickly and very publicly , " and with broader support from the international community than @entity1 airstrikes , she said			0
" if the civilian population can be equipped to contend with this , just as they have adjusted their lifestyles to adapt to urban warfare around them , then perhaps that takes away some of the advantage , " she said			0
" if your chemical attack does n't have an effect , then why use the weapons ? " opinion : 5 reasons the @entity1 must intervene in @entity6			2

@entity1 has few good options in @entity6 , *observers* say
chemical weapons experts say send gas masks , not bombs
@entity151 : a " clear violation " of global standards needs a response
strikes are " more about @entity21 saving face , " historian says
