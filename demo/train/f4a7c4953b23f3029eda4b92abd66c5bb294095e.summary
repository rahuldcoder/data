@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 had a blunt message for the roughly 300 @entity1 police officers and sheriff 's deputies who gathered to hear him warn about the dangers of @entity10 radicalism			1
@entity11 and @entity10 are inseparable , he tells them			1
all @entity14 mosques should be under scrutiny			2
" all @entity10 organizations in @entity14 should be the no. 1 enemy			1
all of them , " he says			0
it 's a message @entity3 is selling based on his own background as a @entity22 - @entity14 convert to conservative @entity23			1
born in the @entity24 , the son of an @entity14 mother , he says he was a @entity27 terrorist in his youth who helped firebomb an @entity30 bank in @entity31 and spent time in an @entity30 jail			1
that billing helps him land speaking engagements like a may event in @entity0 -- a forum put on by the state @entity38 , which paid @entity40 $ 5,000 for the appearance			0
he 's a darling on the church and university lecture circuit , with his speeches , books and video sales bringing in $ 500,000 - plus in 2009 , according to tax records			1
" being an ex-terrorist myself is to understand the mindset of a terrorist , " @entity3 told @entity2 's " @entity52 360			1
" but @entity2 reporters in the @entity14 , @entity30 and the @entity22 territories found no evidence that would support that biography			1
neither @entity40 nor his business partner provided any proof of @entity40 's involvement in terrorism , despite repeated requests			2
back in his hometown of @entity64 , outside @entity31 , relatives say they ca n't understand how @entity40 could turn so roundly on his family and his faith			0
" i have never heard anything about @entity69 being a mujahedeen or a terrorist , " said @entity67 , who says he is @entity3 's fourth cousin			1
" he claims this for his own personal reasons			0
" @entity2 's @entity75 bureau went to great lengths trying to verify @entity40 's story			1
the @entity79 headquarters of @entity80 had no record of a firebombing at its now - demolished @entity31 branch			2
@entity30 police had no record of the bombing , and the prison where @entity3 says he was held " for a few weeks " for inciting anti-israel demonstrations says it has no record of him being incarcerated there either			1
@entity3 says he was never charged because he was a @entity14 citizen			1
" i was born by an @entity14 mother , " he said			0
" the other conspirators in the act ended up in jail			0
" he said his own family has vouched for his prison time			0
but relatives @entity2 spoke to described him as a " regular kid " who left home at 18 , eventually becoming a computer programmer in the @entity14			1
@entity3 , now in his 50s , says he converted to @entity23 in 1993 and began spreading the word about the dangers of @entity10			1
he has been interviewed as a terrorism expert on several television programs , including a handful of appearances on @entity2 and its sister network , @entity111 , in 2006 and 2007			1
since @entity113 's 2001 attacks on @entity114 and @entity115 , expertise on terrorism has been in high demand			2
the federal @entity38 has spent nearly $ 40 million on counterterrorism training since 2006			2
the department does n't keep track of how much goes to speakers , nor does it advise officials on the speakers hired by states and municipalities			0
@entity3 spoke at a 2010 conference in @entity1 and was so well - received that he was invited back for the may event in @entity0 , according to state officials			1
he warned the police and first responders gathered in the hotel conference rooms that the @entity135 @entity134 militia @entity133 had operatives working in @entity137 and that drug cartels were raising money with @entity10 groups			1
he also asserted that federal agents could have prevented the 9/11 attacks by looking for a chafed spot , called " zabibah , " that sometimes forms on the foreheads of devout @entity147			0
" you need ex-terrorists who can tell you what life is like and what thinking is like of potential terrorists , " @entity3 said			1
" but had we looked at the zabibah only , we would have deflected a suicide action of killing 3,000 @entity14			0
" but @entity3 also told the group there were 17 hijackers when there were 19			1
and perhaps more surprising from a man who bills himself as a terror expert , @entity3 said the @entity162 could have stopped them			1
the @entity162 was n't created until after the 9 - 11 attacks			2
@entity165 , @entity1 's homeland security director , said @entity3 brought " a point of view that certainly is not mainstream			1
" " he brings in commentary about living and being raised as a @entity134 and converting over to @entity23 -- gives them a different aspect of breaking the mold , so to speak , " @entity165 said			2
but he said @entity3 's appearance was " a small portion " of the two - and - a - half - day conference			1
" it 's not like we 're talking about setting up training and a discipline we would follow , that this is the only way and that 's the particular point of view of a @entity134 or somebody of the @entity10 faith			1
that 's not the case , " @entity165 said			2
" that 's his point of view			2
" @entity165 said there is " no fear of threat " from @entity10 terrorism in @entity1 , where the last census reports showed the state 's @entity134 community made up less than one - half of 1 percent of the population			1
according to @entity0 's local newspaper , about two dozen @entity147 live in the city			2
during @entity3 's presentation , he criticized @entity134 organizations and told audience members to be leery of @entity134 doctors , engineers , students and mosques			1
" now , we are n't saying every single mosque is potential terrorist headquarters			0
but if you look at certain reports by the @entity211 report , 80 percent of mosques they found pamphlets and education on jihad			2
so they 're in the mosque , the mosque in accordance to the @entity217 is the command post and center			0
" the conservative @entity222 said it never issued such a report and has no idea why its name was invoked			0
@entity3 warned that making special accommodations for @entity134 beliefs was a step toward establishing @entity10 religious law			1
and he recounted how he wore a t - shirt that read " profile me " on a trip to the airport and approached the screeners at the security checkpoint			0
" i got tapped down , i got checked , i got all these different things , " he said			0
" i say it 's wonderful			0
" @entity40 and business partner @entity237 run several foundations and three websites that are all linked			0
@entity3 said the major group , the @entity240 , includes his own @entity241			2
in tax records filed by @entity237 , the @entity240 reported 2009 earnings from speaking engagements , videos and book sales of more than $ 560,000			0
the documents are thin on specifics , and so is @entity40			0
" basically , we are in information , and we do speaking and we do also helping @entity252 that are being persecuted in countries like @entity255 , and we help @entity252 that are suffering all throughout the @entity257 , " he said			0
asked how they do that , he said , " none of your business " -- adding that disclosing details could endanger people he was trying to help in @entity10 countries that have laws against blasphemy			2
@entity3 's name does n't appear on any of the paperwork			1
as for his own salary , he said he makes " probably what a gas station makes or a garage makes			0
" " everybody thinks i 'm just raking in the dough , which is absolutely incorrect , " he said			0
he referred details to @entity237 , who offered to provide a copy of the group 's tax returns -- but did n't			0
when asked who served on the foundation 's board of advisers , @entity237 gave " @entity288 " the name of a former pilot , who did n't return phone calls			0
but he could not name the high - ranking military officers he said were on the board			0
federal officials say they do n't know exactly how much money has gone to speakers like @entity40			0
but in april , the bipartisan leaders of the @entity295 raised concerns about " vitriolic diatribes " being delivered by " self - appointed counterterrorism experts " at similar seminars			1
sen. @entity300 , the committee 's @entity302 chairwoman , and @entity305 independent sen. @entity304 asked the department to account for how much federal grant money went to state and local counterterrorism programs and what standards guided those grants			1
the request followed reports by the @entity314 and the @entity315 that raised similar questions			0
the @entity38 told @entity2 that it has standards -- and if training programs do n't meet them , " corrective action will be taken			2
" " we have not and will not tolerate training programs -- or any @entity38 - supported program -- that rely on racial or ethnic profiling , " the agency said in a written statement			0
@entity326 and @entity327 in @entity75 and @entity328 and @entity329 in @entity330 contributed to this report			0
