@entity1 , @entity0 -- rare images of an @entity5 animal so elusive that it was once believed to be mythical have been released			1
one of the first pictures of the elusive okapi was taken by camera trap			2
the okapi is a shy animal related to the giraffe , with zebra - like stripes on its rear			1
it is native to the tropical rainforests of @entity5 but is now known to live only in the @entity16			1
@entity17 were last seen in the @entity16 50 years ago , and the images are the first to capture the animal in the wild			1
" to have captured the first - ever photographs of such a charismatic creature is amazing , " said @entity21 , manager of the @entity22 at the @entity23 , which took the pictures			2
" okapi are very shy and rare animals , which is why conventional surveys only tend to record droppings and other signs of their presence			2
" the okapi 's face and long legs resemble those of the giraffe , their closest - living relative , but they look more like horses with long necks			1
the average height of their shoulders is 1.6 meters ( 5 feet , 3 inches ) , the @entity23 says			0
they have a short , dense , velvety coat and dark prehensile tongue long enough to clean their own eyelids and ears			0
the new pictures show the okapi in the foliage of the @entity16 's @entity52 , where decades of economic collapse and armed conflict have threatened the diverse wildlife			1
in one image , an okapi looks curiously toward the camera amid the green trees and groundcover			2
its large ears , dark nose , and zebra stripes are clearly visible			2
the next shot shows the okapi walking away from the camera , giving a clear view of its striking black - and - white stripes on its rear legs			1
a third image released by @entity23 was taken at night and gives a vivid side view of the animal			0
" the photographs clearly show the stripes on their rear , which act like unique fingerprints , " said @entity74 , a key member of @entity23 's survey team in the @entity16			1
" we have already identified three individuals , and further survey work will enable us to estimate population numbers and distribution in and around the park , which is a critical first step in targeting conservation efforts			0
" @entity23 said the images prove the okapi still thrives in the park despite threats to its survival , which include poaching , deforestation , military camps inside the park , and the influx of refugees at the park 's borders			0
the animal 's exact status is still a mystery , however , and it remains under threat , the @entity23 said			0
okapi meat reportedly poached from the park is now regularly on sale at the nearby town of @entity109 -- and if hunting continues at the same rate , okapi could become extinct within the park within a few years , the @entity23 said			0
the @entity52 is one of only three protected areas the okapi are known to inhabit , the @entity23 said			0
the @entity23 's study of the okapi is part of a larger @entity121 - funded conservation project in the park			2
though focused on okapi , the study has also managed to find other species including shrews and duikers , a kind of antelope , a @entity23 spokeswoman said			0
the study involved 18 cameras set up around the park by the @entity23 and the @entity133 , the spokeswoman said			0
the announcement comes a month after another group of researchers reported finding thousands of previously - unknown gorillas in the neighboring @entity138			0
the @entity140 - based @entity139 said in august they had found 125,000 @entity142 lowland gorillas living in a swamp in northern @entity16 , adding significantly to the existing worldwide population of the threatened species			1
@entity17 were well known by @entity5 for centuries but the animal remained elusive , thanks to its acute hearing and effective camouflage , according to @entity151			1
@entity154 - century explorers sometimes caught a fleeting glimpse of the okapi 's striped backside as it ran through the forest , leading to speculation that it was a kind of zebra , the @entity152 says			1
it was known to the pygmy as a sacred animal			0
still , the okapi remained unknown to the western world until the early 20th century , when @entity167 explorer @entity165 went to @entity16 and sent a complete skin and skull back to @entity167 , the @entity23 said .			1
