editor 's note : @entity2 is deputy editor for the @entity3			1
before joining the newspaper , she was a senior adviser for the @entity5 and was named a public affairs director in the @entity7 by president @entity8			1
@entity2 says president @entity8 will be remembered for keeping @entity10 safe			1
@entity11 ( @entity12 ) -- in his final radio address as president - elect on the sunday ahead of his inauguration , @entity13 said president @entity8 " extended the hand of cooperation " to him throughout this period of transition			1
it was a final act of civility , on mr. @entity8 's part			1
it is a trait that is not surprising to those who know @entity8 ( or those paying some attention at least half of the time )			1
at least one @entity30 has given him credit for it			0
unfortunately , that tone of civility has been lost on the @entity37 leadership over the past eight years			2
civility aside , how others -- more importantly , history -- will judge the 43rd president of the @entity10 , is the question that has followed @entity8 out the door			1
lucky for him , it wo n't just be up to @entity37 to determine			2
" i believe president @entity8 will be vindicated , " said secretary of state @entity45 in an interview a couple of weeks ago			1
she may be an ardent defender of @entity8 , but i believe she 's right			2
she , like i , have a different vantage point than what has been routinely portrayed			0
while sitting in the @entity50 with the 43rd president , for what was his last official week in office last thursday , i got the sense that he feels he will be vindicated , too			0
he wo n't say as much , directly , but indirectly points to what matters most in his eyes -- protecting the homeland			0
" history will eventually see ... that not only was it necessary to take the steps i took , but [ they ] led to a better world , " the president told me			0
on a personal level ( and for the sake of full disclosure ) , i must say that i have had the pleasure of working for and knowing @entity8 from his first campaign for president and throughout his presidency			1
i started as a volunteer in 1999 , then worked as a spokeswoman during his second campaign and then as an appointee in his administration			0
not only have i counted it an honor and a privilege to serve the 43rd president , but i have always had a deep respect for him as a person of faith , his strident conviction in doing what was right for the country and his commitment to closing the disparities that exist between black and white @entity10 -- no matter the mistakes made and lessons learned			1
above all , it is his dignity and civility that stand out to me most			0
yet , for many conservatives ( not just liberals ) , @entity8 has failed on many fronts			2
from the miscalculation of the insurgency in @entity101 , to failed intelligence gathering and the issues of maintaining fiscal conservatism and delivering real immigration reform -- i ca n't tell you how many @entity107 and conservatives i 've spoken to over this past year who have told me how " disappointed " they 've been with @entity8			1
a few among them voted for " change " as a result			0
the legacy @entity8 leaves behind wo n't be everything he wanted ( particularly as it relates to popularity ) , but on many fronts , it will be better than that of his predecessor			1
@entity120 may have been popular , but his moral failings brought shame on the office of the presidency and tainted the people 's house			2
that will forever be a stain on @entity120 's legacy			2
not to mention , there was no such " civility " or " cooperation " when @entity120 turned the keys over to @entity8			1
i prefer principle over popularity any day			0
on the moral front , president @entity8 delivered			1
on the social front , he delivered			0
on the fiscal front he failed considerably			0
yet , on the national security front and on many domestic policies , he succeeded			1
depending on your vantage point , success may mean something wholly different			0
the details will be debated for decades to come			0
among the many uncertainties , one thing is certain -- you ca n't judge history in the midst of it			0
declaring one " the worst " president while he 's still in office is an effort in rhetorical futility			0
historians know this all too well			0
the best prediction one can make was summed up by presidential historian @entity159 on " @entity160 " last year : " if @entity101 became the model democracy or even just a democracy , and in doing so changed the whole complexion of the @entity164 , then obviously that would be the legacy that would justify what @entity8 did and what our troops did			2
" and that 's exactly what mr. @entity8 is banking on			2
during my @entity50 interview with the president , i asked him to complete the sentence " president @entity8 was ... [ fill in the blank ]			1
" he responded ( uncharacteristically in third person ) : " president @entity8 was the president at a time when our nation was attacked , he clearly saw the dangers , he pursued the enemy , he put tools in place so the professionals could better protect the people , and the homeland was not attacked			1
" that is the legacy he wants			0
popular or not , he kept @entity10 safe			1
and if nothing else , for that , he will be vindicated			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : @entity13 *praised* president @entity8 for cooperative nature of transition
@entity2 : it was a final act of civility by @entity8 ; she says he was n't given same by @entity120
she says @entity8 delivered on national security and many domestic issues
@entity8 will be remembered for keeping @entity10 safe , @entity2 says
