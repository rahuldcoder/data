editor 's note : col. @entity2 , who served for 29 years in the @entity3 and @entity4 , was one of the first @entity6 officers to open the @entity7 in @entity8 in 2001			2
she resigned from the @entity6 in protest the day the @entity10 began			0
she had served as a diplomat for 16 years and received the @entity6 's @entity12			0
@entity13 is @entity14 's political director and the founder of the @entity16			1
president @entity17 just announced he plans to send 30,000 more troops into @entity19 , where hatred of the @entity21 grows every day			1
next door , nuclear - armed @entity22 tilts toward disaster			0
it 's time for @entity21 to insist on a nonmilitary way out of this mess			1
we recently returned from a @entity30 study trip to @entity19 , and our expertise and experience points to a strategy of transitioning from military to political and economic solutions that will help @entity19 while making @entity21 safer			1
the first step in providing @entity19 security and weakening the @entity39 and violent extremists is to remove recruiting incentives			1
it 's time to stop air and predator drone strikes that tend to kill , injure and terrorize civilians			2
it 's time to stop arbitrary detentions and harsh treatment of prisoners that would be unacceptable here			2
while those in major cities live in relative security , rural @entity19 fear violence from insurgents or @entity21 and @entity56 forces			1
many fear civil war or the return of the @entity39			1
@entity19 requires more trusted @entity19 police and security forces			0
these forces are paid only $ 110 dollars a month -- not a living wage -- and payments are regularly late			0
little wonder these forces are corrupt , poorly motivated and have a high rate of desertion			0
the @entity39 pays its foot soldiers far better			1
investing in a living wage and pressuring @entity70 's government to punish corruption swiftly will pay more security dividends than the $ 1 million a year it costs to send one @entity21 soldier			1
there is no reason to believe the @entity21 military is in the best position to train @entity19 , given huge cultural differences and past abuses by @entity21 forces			1
the @entity82 is expert in training security forces in ways that are culturally sensitive			0
the @entity21 should ask ( and help fund ) the @entity82 to take over the training of @entity19 troops and police , with a focus on training @entity19 trainers			1
with @entity19 unemployment above 40 percent , job creation is critical to security			0
vocational training , infrastructure construction and assistance to farmers will help			0
we can pay for this economic development by spending current funds more wisely			2
a criminally small amount of the international aid and development money spent over the last eight years has trickled down to @entity19			2
instead , foreign contractors , subcontractors and importers have profited from @entity19 misery			0
@entity110 's new mantra of " @entity19 first " is a start , as long as actions match the rhetoric			0
one successful program that deserves full funding is the @entity116 , an @entity19 - run community development program administered by the well - regarded @entity118			0
@entity17 , @entity56 commander gen. @entity124 and @entity82 secretary general @entity125 should all mandate that where possible , @entity19 -- including their businesses , @entity120 and products -- should implement and directly benefit from aid projects			1
@entity17 did n't mention @entity19 women in his speech			0
funding women - led ngos , women 's education and job training and hiring women can help raise their status			0
outside the capital , not much has changed for @entity19 women			0
because of cultural traditions , many rural women stay home for lack of security or because of their husbands ' demands			0
the @entity21 could transition resources to the @entity19 justice system to properly enforce laws about rape and domestic violence , and ensure that girls younger than 16 are not forced to marry			1
the president rightly mentioned the importance of the @entity22 border			0
more resources must be transferred to securing the @entity22 - @entity19 border			0
this is easier said than done , as @entity21 border guards know from their own difficulties of securing the @entity157 border			1
nonetheless , the international community can increase political pressure on @entity22 to strengthen their border patrols and rid their country of violent extremists such as @entity163			2
despite assurances by the president , more troops will not provide more security to @entity19			2
the mere presence of foreign forces and some of their actions have created more @entity39 recruits and violent extremists			1
instead of starting to bring troops home in 18 months , @entity21 and @entity56 forces must tell internal and regional stakeholders -- publicly or privately -- that there will be a range of time , say 12 to 24 months , when their military presence will cease			1
then , they must apply significant pressure and concrete support for a public , comprehensive peace process			2
this process must include all interested parties , including the @entity70 administration , tribal leaders , the @entity39 , women leaders , as well as neighboring @entity190 , @entity22 and @entity191			1
the @entity21 mission in @entity19 can then focus on rebuilding the country the @entity21 partly destroyed eight years ago ( through air strikes and funding warlords in the @entity196 ) , lifting @entity19 out of poverty and making the country less of a haven or recruiting center for extremists			2
it 's time for a transition from military investments to an economic and civic strategy that supports reconciling and reintegrating @entity39 fighters , reducing poverty and rebuilding infrastructure			1
@entity17 outlined escalation rather than the needed transition			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 and @entity13 .			2

@entity21 , @entity56 need to stop giving @entity39 reasons to recruit supporters , authors say
@entity218 and @entity13 say economic aid and **negotiations** can succeed instead of troops
allies should plan to withdraw troops but put pressure on for **negotiations** , they say
