-- support for abortion rights has fallen sharply in the past year , with @entity3 now split roughly 50 - 50 between those who back legal access to abortion and those who oppose it , according to a new survey			1
anti-abortion activists demonstrate on @entity11 in @entity12 in september			2
the findings mark a dramatic shift in public opinion , supporters of abortion rights have outnumbered opponents for many years , with one brief exception , studies have shown			1
but only 47 percent of @entity3 now feel abortion should be legal in all or most cases , a drop from 54 percent a year ago , according to the poll			1
meanwhile , 45 percent say it should be illegal in all or most cases			0
that 's up from 41 percent a year ago			0
given the survey 's margin of error , the two camps are statistically tied			0
" these data suggest that a number of people have changed their minds in the past year , " said @entity30 of the @entity31 , one of the survey 's authors			1
it 's not only one type of person or group whose opinion has changed , he said			0
" there was a drop seen in many , many demographics : men and women , people with a college degree and those with less education , people with various religious backgrounds , " he said			1
the only groups whose opinions on abortion did not change were african - americans -- who tend to oppose it -- and young people and those not affiliated with any particular religion , who tend to say it should be legal , he said			1
" beyond that , this movement [ was ] across the board , " he said			0
anti-abortion activists welcomed the findings			1
" this is great news			0
this poll shows that the pro-life movement is winning hearts and minds			0
pro-lifers are making an effective case that all women deserve better than abortion and that every child deserves a chance to be born , " said @entity74 , the senior fellow for legal studies at the anti-abortion @entity76 in @entity12			1
the rev. @entity83 , a @entity84 , @entity85 - based anti-abortion activist , said the survey reflected a change he had already seen taking place			1
" it 's something that we have known for a long , long time that 's been beneath the radar , " he said			0
" the heart of @entity3 is changing and only with time do the laws reflect that change			1
" " when the church will come out into the streets , we win the battle , " said @entity83 , director of operations for @entity96			0
" we have to return to the @entity100 of our founding fathers and our pilgrim fathers , " he said			0
but @entity103 , the president of the @entity104 , firmly rejects religious opposition to abortion			2
" abortion is a blessing when it is chosen freely by a woman who needs it			2
it is a blessing , " she said , citing the rev. @entity112 , dean of the @entity113			0
@entity103 has been in that position herself , she said			0
" when i was in my early 20s , i thought i needed an abortion			2
i was escaping a very violent marriage that lasted about eight months , " she said			0
" the young man i was married to exploded and severely battered me			0
" she fled to her parents ' home			0
a month later , she began to suspect she was pregnant with her abusive husband 's child			0
" if i had had a baby , i would have been tied to that man for the rest of my life , " she said			0
" i did n't need the abortion , as it turned out , but if i had needed that abortion , it would have been a blessing			2
" i knew i was going to become a mother , but not with that man , not with that pregnancy , " she said			0
she said it was important to distinguish between people who oppose abortion and those who want it to be against the law			1
" i do realize that a lot of people in this country consider themselves to be pro-life , " she said			2
" they also do n't want it to be a crime for a woman to get an abortion			2
" @entity30 , the researcher , suspects the election of president @entity148 , a pro-choice @entity149 , may be one cause of the shift in public opinion			2
" look at the timing , " he said			0
" through october of last year , the findings were consistent , with supporters outnumbering opponents , " he said			1
@entity31 first noticed the change in public opinion in a survey in april , and did a larger study in august to confirm it			2
opponents of abortion feel more strongly about it than supporters of legal access , he said			1
" some people , particularly on the right , have become more entrenched , more certain of their own positions on abortion , " he said			1
" conservative @entity170 are more certain about the correctness of their own position and less likely to say they want to see compromise			0
they are concerned that @entity148 will go too far in supporting abortion rights as president , " he said			1
" on the left you see some relaxing of views			0
" but the survey also found that the number of people who felt passionately about abortion is falling			1
about four out of 10 people in the survey could not define @entity148 's position on abortion			1
" that is an indicator that although opinions have moved , this issue right now is not at the top of the political debate , " @entity30 said			1
but the subject has crept into the battle to reform @entity3 's health care system , with opponents of abortion in both parties determined to prevent federal dollars from funding abortions			1
under the @entity204 amendment , federal money currently can be used to pay for abortions only in case of rape , incest and to protect the life of the mother			2
there have been at least two abortion - related slayings in the @entity3 this year , one on each side of the debate			1
@entity215 , a doctor known for performing abortions , was killed in may			2
@entity215 was shot in the head at point - blank range on may 31 as services began at @entity219 in @entity220 , @entity221			2
@entity222 , a 51 - year - old anti-abortion activist , is charged in @entity215 's killing			2
he has pleaded not guilty			0
anti-abortion activist @entity224 , 63 , was shot dead outside a school in @entity226 , @entity227 , on september 11			0
he was associated with @entity83 's @entity96			0
@entity224 , 33 , is accused of shooting him and another man in separate locations that day			0
authorities do not believe that @entity224 knew @entity224 ; only that he was offended by anti-abortion material that @entity224 had displayed across from the school all week , according to @entity233 of the @entity235 prosecutor 's office			0
the @entity236 , the country 's main legal battleground on abortion , has ruled only once on the hot - button subject since 1992 , in a close 2007 decision that upheld federal restrictions on a controversial late - term abortion procedure called " partial birth abortion " by its opponents			1
judge @entity246 , then a federal appeals court judge , deflected questions about abortion this summer when she faced @entity251 confirmation hearings for a seat on the @entity236			1
the court has not announced any abortion - related cases on its 2009 - 2010 docket			1
the 1973 @entity236 ruling @entity256 effectively legalized abortion in the @entity3			1
in 2005 , 1.21 million abortions were performed , down from 1.31 million in 2000 , according to data compiled by the @entity260 , which aims to " advance sexual and reproductive health worldwide through research , policy analysis and education			1
" about 2 percent of @entity3 women age 15 - 44 had an abortion in 2005 , the latest year for which the institute has information			1
the rate has been falling gradually since 1981 , when it peaked at just under 3 percent , institute figures show			0
the new findings come from a telephone survey of more than 4,000 adults in august 2009 , conducted by the @entity12 - based @entity31 and the @entity31			1
@entity0 @entity236 producer @entity276 contributed to this report .			0
