@entity1 , @entity0 -- for the 2.5 million people who have fled the four - year conflict in war - torn @entity7 , refugee camps in eastern @entity4 hold the promise of a safe haven			1
women and girls have to make perilous journeys outside their refugee camps to find firewood but , once there , it 's the women refugees ' role to find wood and water			1
to do this , they have to leave the camps and walk for many miles , putting their very lives at risk			2
now , a small nonprofit organization is cutting the dangers faced by these women , by helping them to move away from firewood and cook using cardboard , tinfoil and the power of the sun. and as well as saving lives , they 're offering refugees hope , independence and economic opportunity			1
a month 's wood supply " lasts five days " the @entity38 gives @entity7 refugees a maize / soy mixture , beans , lentils , salt , oil and firewood			1
but a month 's wood ration only lasts five days , so to cook this food , women are forced to forage for fuel -- and that 's a dangerous business			1
when they leave the relative safety of the camps , they are vulnerable to beatings , rape and murder at the hands of roving @entity57 patrols and local villagers , with whom they compete for scanty resources			1
when @entity64 nonprofit @entity62 heard about the dangers these @entity7 refugees face , they were determined to act			1
their co-founder and president , @entity69 , told @entity2 , " these women have survived onslaughts on their villages and hundreds of miles of walking to get to a camp			1
that they should be vulnerable there seemed terrible			2
" @entity62 saw that if they could cut the number of trips that women had to make outside the camps , they should see a concomitant fall in violent attacks			1
solar cooking seemed the solution			1
without forces of their own on the ground , the charity decided to fund a partner to run a trial			0
but when they approached the large relief organizations , they received a lukewarm response : the cultural and educational challenges involved in solar cooking were felt to be insurmountable			1
@entity69 and her colleagues were certain solar cooking would work in the camps , and they persisted			1
" if you protected your daughter from having to walk 20 miles to find wood and give her body to violence in the process , would n't you think that 's worth it ? " she told @entity2			2
" what do people think , that these people do n't care about their daughters as much as you and i care about ours ? they do what they have to for survival , but that does n't mean they like it			0
" eventually , @entity62 were put in touch with @entity119 , a small @entity120 nonprofit who were carrying out a pilot in @entity124 camp , home to 17,000 refugees			2
in may 2006 , the @entity128 project launched			0
" it ca n't be hot : there has been no fire			0
" at project manager @entity133 's first demonstration in @entity135 , @entity133 's 40 - strong female audience was skeptical			0
he set up the cooker , then waited until the food was ready			0
" i took the oldest , most respected mama i could find in the group , " he recalls			0
" i said , ' @entity141 , will you open the bag and take the pot out ? ' i offered her my handkerchief and said , ' take this , because the pot will be hot			0
' she looked at me and said , ' no , it ca n't be hot : there has been no fire			0
' i said , ' @entity141 , i warn you , it is very hot			0
' she said , ' it ca n't be hot			0
' she opened the bag , put her hand on the pot and jumped back two meters			0
then she looked at me and said , ' i have two hands ! i want two handkerchiefs ! ' " the women were incredulous that solar cooking had worked			1
@entity133 offered to teach them how to cook their food using solar the following day , but he still had to promise them his rations as a guarantee in case it did n't work			2
the women in @entity124 camp have now embraced solar cooking wholeheartedly , even converting their menfolk , who were skeptical initially because the food tasted different			1
cardboard and tinfoil @entity133 's team ships in the cardboard and aluminum foil that makes the cookers			2
the refugees use @entity181 gum as a glue , which they buy in @entity4 -- and that 's all they need			0
and he is keen that the refugees own and run the project independently			0
" our only jobs are to show it once or twice , train the auxiliary trainers and train the artisans			0
it is now their project , " he said			0
the climate in @entity4 allows the women in @entity124 camp to cook on solar for about 330 days per year			1
they still have to use wood stoves in the mornings , but lunch is cooked using solar , as is the evening meal , which is kept warm in insulated baskets until it 's needed			2
over 18 months , all women in the @entity124 camp over the age of 15 have been trained and 10,000 cookers have been distributed			1
and when the women at nearby @entity206 camp heard about the solar cookers at @entity135 , they asked if the project could be extended			1
that 's happening shortly : @entity133 estimates that the women in @entity206 will be cooking with solar within a year and a half			1
eventually , @entity62 hopes to extend the project to a third camp , as well as funding the ongoing projects at @entity135 and @entity206 -- the cookers have to be replaced every few months			1
trips to find firewood " cut by three quarters " @entity133 reports that the number of trips women make to find firewood has fallen by about three quarters			1
but that 's not the only advantage			0
now that the women do n't have to sit by smoky fires constantly stirring their food , they are healthier and have more free time to develop cottage industries , like vegetable gardening and craftwork			1
the gardens are irrigated using recycled water from the showers			0
some women weave insulation baskets ; others make protective bags to carry the cookers			1
@entity133 has recently struck a deal with the trucks and the @entity243 planes that bring supplies to the camp to take back the women 's handicrafts for sale in the @entity249			1
what will the future hold for these refugees ? the message from the women at @entity128 is of hope , one day			2
" they all say , ' when we go back home , we 'll teach this to all the women in our village and they will all do solar cooking , ' " @entity133 told @entity2			1
" they 're convinced they 're going home			0
" @entity133 himself is less sure			0
" i know it wo n't be immediate but i hope that the refugees can go back in a few years , " he said			0
" it will be an immeasurable shame on the @entity249 if we could n't arrange that			0
" a catalyst for the future as for solar cooking , @entity275 hopes that the success of their project will inspire others			2
" i would hope that our little project was a catalyst for the @entity283 to wean the relief organizations off wood and onto solar cooking , " she said			2
" that 's our ultimate dream			0
" " the larger organizations tend to see things a little bit more rigidly : find a solution to cook today 's dinner , " she continued			0
" but the problem 's not an instant one to solve			0
you do n't just keep providing the firewood for today 's dinner			2
you build for the future			0
" and back in @entity124 camp , the ray of hope that solar cooking is bringing to some of the world 's most destitute people -- along with personal safety , improved health and entrepreneurial opportunity -- will continue to shine			1
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... is slow - cooking with solar power the way forward ? do you think the @entity310 should switch to solar cooking ? share your thoughts and read others ' views in the just imagine forum			2

violence in @entity7 has left more than *200,000* dead and 2.5 million displaced
solar cookers in refugee camp reduce the need for firewood by up to 75 *percent*
fewer trips outside leaves women less prone to beatings , rape and murder
accompanying cottage industries provide entrepreneurial opportunity
