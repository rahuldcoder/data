i 've seen death in war zones -- @entity3 , @entity5 's tribal region , @entity6 -- but never have i seen as much bloodshed as i saw in @entity8 on august 14 , 2013			1
it was the day @entity11 's security forces used automatic weapons , armored personal carriers and military bulldozers to raid and crush a monthlong sit - in protest by thousands of supporters of former @entity11 president @entity17			1
according to a yearlong @entity20 investigation released this week , at least 817 people were killed			2
the rights group called it " one of the world 's largest killings of demonstrators in a single day in recent history			1
" six weeks earlier , @entity17 had been removed from power in a popular military coup led by his then - defense secretary , gen. @entity31			2
@entity17 's supporters immediately took to the streets , protesting the removal of @entity11 's first democratically elected president			1
the heart of the demonstrations was @entity38 , a mosque in eastern @entity8 where tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered , occupying the building and an adjacent square			1
for weeks , @entity11 authorities ordered demonstrators to leave , then threatened to raid the massive sit - in that had mushroomed into a small town ; it included a makeshift barbershop and a kitchen that prepared thousands of ready - to - eat meals			1
but @entity17 supporters would n't budge			2
many had brought their families , even their children			2
shortly after 7 a.m. i was awakened by a text message from one of the protesters i had interviewed earlier			1
" they 're coming , " read the message			2
about one hour later i was at @entity63 with my team -- @entity66 producer @entity65 and cameraman @entity67			1
the sit - in protest that spanned several city blocks had turned into a war zone			2
it looked like the @entity72			0
there was the incessant crack of gunfire , the anguished cries of protesters , debris - filled intersections on fire , thick smoke mixed with burning tear gas , and bodies -- lots of bodies			1
i lost count of how many times protesters raced past me carrying bodies wrapped in blankets			1
many of them had been shot and killed			0
" i saw one teenager with a wound to the head , " my producer @entity91 told me			0
" i 'm still not sure if he was alive			0
" according to witnesses , security forces moved in shortly before 7 a.m. authorities claim they used loudspeakers to warn protesters to clear out and provided two safe exits , but witnesses say police immediately opened fire and bulldozed through the camp 's tents and makeshift shelters			1
the front line was a major intersection where protesters erected and set on fire a heaping pile of debris to stop the advance of security forces			1
" this was one of the starkest scenes i have ever seen in my life , " said @entity91			0
" it 's forever etched in my brain -- the scorched ruins of the @entity124 square - turned @entity123 's land -- between menacing black police @entity125 and men behind metal sheets whose greatest form of protection was the loud noise of batons beating against their makeshift barriers			1
it was utter chaos and bloodletting			1
" @entity11 authorities had justified the raid by claiming protesters had fired first with automatic weapons , killing one of eight police officer who died that day			1
during my 12 hours at @entity63 i never saw protesters carrying automatic weapons			1
at one point i saw one protester firing what looked like a homemade pistol			0
but the vast majority of protesters were fighting heavily armed security with clubs , rocks , and sometimes @entity155 cocktails			1
witnesses and rights groups dispute the government 's claims too			1
in its investigation , @entity20 concluded that " demonstrators fired on police in at least a few instances			1
" " the killing of 817 or more protesters was clearly disproportionate to any threat to local residents , security personnel , or anyone else , " the report said			2
later in the day the interior minister @entity171 said security forces had recovered 15 guns , a small number relative to the thousands of protesters at the encampment			1
the most lasting images of the day came from the camp 's makeshift hospital			1
scores of wounded bodies were strewn on blood - smeared floors			0
most of victims appeared to be shot			0
" the smell is what i remember the most , " said @entity67 , my cameraman			0
" i was doing my job but i was scared			0
i tried to keep my eye on my viewfinder and imagine that this was just a tv show			0
the only thing that broke through was the smell of blood			0
" several hours into the raid the crew from @entity198 walked by and warned us that snipers on rooftops were targeting anyone wearing protective helmets			0
their cameraman was the gentle giant @entity206 , a veteran photojournalist who had worked for @entity66 and @entity207 before joining @entity198			1
later in the day i learned that @entity206 had been shot and killed			2
" i think the security forces just got tired of seeing him there			0
so they decided to kill him , " @entity206 's wife @entity211 wrote in an opinion piece this week in the @entity213			2
" not that i 'll ever know for sure			0
they 've never admitted it , of course , and the coroner 's investigation of @entity206 's death the morning of aug. 14 , 2013 , in @entity8 has yielded nothing			1
a year later , i 've given up thinking it ever will			0
" @entity206 was months away from retiring , his wife said			0
by 6 p.m. , security forces had taken full control of the area , demolishing hundreds of tents and bulldozing anything in sight -- including charred remains of protesters			2
thousands of protesters left in utter shock and despair			2
one car rolled past me with a body in the trunk			0
in the backseat of another car a woman cradled the body of her dead husband			0
on a nearby sidewalk a teenager sobbed as he knelt before his dead brother			0
" i stopped a young girl in the exodus , " said @entity91			0
" we had done a story just the day before with her on @entity252 and she was dancing and singing with friends about the holiday and her love for @entity17 and the ( @entity257 ) @entity256			2
now she was crying uncontrollably -- ' see what they have done to us ? did you see ? ' she cried			0
' " in its investigation @entity20 said the killings in @entity63 were " likely crimes against humanity " and called on the @entity263 to investigate more than a dozen senior @entity11 leaders , including current president @entity31			2
" this was n't merely a case of excessive force or poor training , " said @entity20 executive director @entity267 in a statement that appeared on the group 's website			1
" it was a violent crackdown planned at the highest levels of the @entity11 government			1
many of the same officials are still in power in @entity11 , and have a lot to answer for			0
" the @entity11 government rejected the report by @entity20 as biased			0
in a statement this week , the government said it had appointed what it calls an " independent fact - finding commission " to investigate the raid on @entity63			0
the same statement said similar fact - finding commissions in @entity11 had concluded , " the dispersal of the sit - ins was conducted in accordance with the relevant international standards			0

*thursday* is the *anniversary* of the violent crackdown on @entity297 protesters in @entity8
rights group : it was " one of the world 's largest killings of demonstrators in a single day in recent history "
