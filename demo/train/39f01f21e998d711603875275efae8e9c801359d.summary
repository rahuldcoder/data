@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 is a tinderbox			1
one miscalculation can quickly lead to all - out war and hundreds of thousands of military and civilian casualties on both sides			1
millions of @entity9 live very close to the @entity10			2
the @entity9 also has a million heavily armed troops on their side of the @entity10 ; the @entity13 nearly has many			2
there are also nearly 30,000 @entity16 troops along the frontier with thousands of artillery pieces and missile launchers facing each other			2
the @entity9 is widely believed to be building a nuclear arsenal			2
i believe this is the most dangerous spot on @entity24 right now			2
we certainly packed a lot into six days here			2
after receiving our visas at the @entity29 in @entity30 , we arrived on thursday , december 16 , on a regularly scheduled @entity29 commercial flight from @entity30 on @entity33 flight 252			2
it was a newish @entity36 - made @entity35 - 300 aircraft and a very smooth 90 - minute flight accompanied with patriotic music and a video showing the heroic struggle of the @entity29 people			2
the attractive flight attendants wore red suit jackets and white gloves			2
we flew back to @entity30 on tuesday , december 22 , a day after our original plan because of an incredibly thick fog			2
the flight back was on @entity49 flight 122 , a @entity50			2
the flight attendants did not wear white gloves			2
@entity0 airport is very small			2
it has only two or three flights a day to only a handful of destinations			2
this is not a very busy airport			2
see more of @entity2 's @entity60 coverage @entity2 @entity30 - based photographer @entity61 and i were covering the visit here of @entity66 gov. @entity65 , a former @entity16 ambassador to the @entity67 experienced in @entity29 diplomacy			1
@entity69 , a @entity30 - based correspondent for the @entity70 , was the only other journalist invited by @entity65 and approved by @entity1 to cover this trip			1
@entity65 was joined by his senior adviser , @entity72 , who 's been to @entity1 40 times going back to 1990			1
he is very impressive with a wealth of knowledge about both @entity60 , @entity76 and @entity77			2
also joining @entity65 was @entity78 , his deputy chief of staff ; @entity79 , chair of the @entity66 @entity81 ; and state police officer @entity82			1
the @entity1 took our passports , return flight tickets and cell phones upon arrival at the airport			1
they returned everything when we were about to board our flight back to @entity30			2
i think it 's fair to say we all had an eye - opening experience			1
it was a roller coaster of emotions -- ranging from real fear of war on the @entity3 to relief that the @entity9 had stepped back from the brink and even accepted some of @entity65 's proposals			1
maybe @entity65 had played a positive role in calming down his hosts , including the chief nuclear negotiator , first vice foreign minister @entity107 ; the new vice minister for foreign affairs , @entity109 ; the military officer in charge of the armistice and @entity113 , major gen. @entity114 ; and the country 's vice president , @entity117			1
we arrived convinced the @entity3 was on the verge of a war , the worst crisis since the 1953 armistice that ended the @entity122			1
this was my first visit to @entity1 , though i had been to @entity125 , the @entity10 and @entity76			1
when @entity65 called me and asked me if i wanted to go with him , i immediately accepted and am glad i did			1
i have known him for 20 years going back to his days in @entity126 -- long before he became @entity67 ambassador and energy secretary during the @entity130 administration			2
i was apprehensive going in , worried about whether i would actually get out			1
i was concerned that they would shut the airport if war erupted , and i would be stuck inside @entity1			1
i even began wondering about the prospects of driving across the @entity1 - @entity76 border if necessary			1
was that even doable ? every time i heard some martial music on @entity29 television and radio , i wondered whether the regime was preparing the country for war			1
i 've covered wars and other dangerous situations over the years and usually go through a before , during and after cycle -- nervous before i leave about all the worst case scenarios ; not all that worried while on assignment because my adrenaline is pumping and i 'm in the midst of a big story ; but wondering after the trip whether i should do it again			1
covering this story brought back memories of my early overseas assignments in the @entity156 in the ' 70s and ' 80s : no internet , no cell phone , no @entity158			2
i had a hard - line phone in my @entity0 hotel room and could make outgoing calls to the @entity16 at about $ 10 a minute			0
( no credit cards accepted ; only cash and only crisp bills			0
) i could not receive incoming calls from the @entity16			0
they would not let us broadcast live via satellite but we took hundreds of still pictures and shot about eight hours of video which we are now going through			0
get ready to see the best on @entity2 and cnn.com			1
i did get @entity174 in my hotel room -- @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity178 never looked better -- but no newspapers			0
still , six days isolated without e-mail or a cell phone ; it was quite a transition for me , but i sort of got used to it and even liked it			0
i had 983 e-mails waiting for me when i eventually got back to @entity30			0
the hotel and elite restaurant food was very good , especially if you like @entity29 food			0
i stuck with scrambled eggs and toast for breakfast ; chicken soup and white rice and steamed veggies for lunch ; and usually some grilled @entity29 chicken or fish for dinner			0
we had @entity29 officials with us all the time -- and i mean all the time			0
they spoke @entity203 well and were very intelligent , polite and even nice			1
they had a job to do , and we understood			0
let 's not forget this is a communist , totalitarian regime			1
we were restricted as to where we could go , what we could film and to whom we could talk			0
they want to showcase the best and keep us way from the worst			0
we constantly pressed for more access and they sometimes relented			1
@entity69 from the @entity70 was especially persistent and her efforts occasionally paid off			0
still , we saw a lot of the @entity29 capital and even managed to get into the countryside to see a huge apple and fruit - tree orchard where thousands of farmers work what the orchard director said were some 2.2 million trees			0
that number seemed exaggerated but whatever it was , it was impressive			0
once you get outside @entity0 , you see very few cars on the roads			0
people are walking along the sides of the roads ; some are riding bikes			0
it 's eerie being in the only car on the road			1
this is a very poor country			0
even as we feared there could be a war , we were taken to a silk thread factory where 2,000 women work diligently			1
we rode the jam - packed subway system from @entity246 to @entity247			0
we went shopping -- again cash only and only crisp @entity16 dollar bills			0
they really do n't like the old , wrinkled bills			0
we spent one afternoon with well - dressed students at @entity253 and later at a foreign language high school where very bright 16 - year - olds were learning @entity257 complete with @entity16 slang			0
i heard one student say : " that 's very cool			1
" he was n't referring to the weather			0
we saw the computers at their national library			0
they were decent but not state of the art. there 's a huge music room at the library where people can simply listen to cds of great artists			1
when i was there , they played a @entity277 song for me			0
he apparently is very popular here			0
they also took us sightseeing			0
we saw their @entity281 ( supposedly bigger than the one in @entity283 ) ; their huge stone tower ( apparently taller than the @entity286 ) ; and their sports complex complete with indoor and outdoor stadiums and ice skating rink			0
i saw the @entity29 girls ' ice hockey team jogging one afternoon and briefly caught up with them			0
they laughed as i ran with them -- probably thinking who is this crazy foreign person carrying a little hand - held camera			0
later , when it looked like the @entity1 would retaliate for @entity125 's live - fire military exercise , i thought of these girls and all the young people i had seen in @entity1			1
they seemed so vulnerable , and i worried about their fate if there were a war			1
i 'm not embarrassed to say i got sentimental and emotional worrying about them and their counterparts in @entity125			0
huge pictures of the late @entity307 , @entity307 , and his son , the @entity308 , @entity308 , were all over the place			0
i did n't see pictures of the next generation 's expected leader , @entity311			1
electricity is a huge problem in @entity1			1
it was bitter cold outside			0
indoor heat is at a premium			0
the students were in the classrooms wearing their warm overcoats			0
the rooms were not well - lit. there were no lights in the tunnels on the roads outside the @entity29 capital			0
outsiders have been predicting its demise for 60 years , but i did n't get the impression this country was on the verge of crumbling			1
we were not taken to the @entity337 nuclear facility or their side of the @entity10 even though we and @entity65 repeatedly asked			1
the @entity1 pointed out this was an especially tense time			1
they said i could come back on another occasion and perhaps visit these places			0
by the way , 2012 is going to be a huge year for @entity1			1
that 's the 100th anniversary of the birth of @entity307			1
the @entity1 are preparing major events			1
since they invited me back , i might go back then ; maybe even sooner though i hope it wo n't be to cover a war			1
did i mention that i 'm worried about the children ? watch @entity353 with @entity354 weekdays at 4pm to 6pm et and saturdays at 6pm et. for the latest from @entity355 .			1

@entity2 's @entity354 traveled with gov. @entity65 to communist @entity1
*blitzer* was worried war would break out while he was there and would be trapped
@entity354 says he was constantly watched , but his overseers were intelligent , polite
no impression @entity1 on the verge of crumbling , @entity354 said
