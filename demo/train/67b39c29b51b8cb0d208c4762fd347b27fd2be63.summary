@entity0 -- he 's a three - time former champion and darling of the @entity5 crowd , but this week @entity6 took to the clay in @entity8 for the final time			1
tennis great @entity6 will retire after his appearance at this year 's @entity5			1
he won the @entity5 as a virtual unknown in 1997 , repeating his triumph in 2000 and 2001			1
the former world number one has suffered injuries and heartache during his 13 - year career on the tour , and will be hanging up his racket after this event			1
prior to going out in the first round to @entity21 he told @entity1 about his @entity8 love affair			2
@entity1 : how does it feel to be going into the tournament you 've won three times as the @entity26 , and it being the last tournament you 'll ever play ? @entity27 : actually the ranking does n't matter for me			1
when i decided to take this farewell tour i was n't looking for ranking points			2
i wanted to have the feelings that i had in the most special places for me , to enjoy them one last time , to see the people and the public			2
today it 's still very hard for me to think that in a week , five days , it will be over			2
i try not to think about it too much			0
i have worked so hard the past three weeks to be in good shape to play at least one good match , that my mind is totally focused on the tournament , as if i were still competing , like in the past years			1
i arrived in @entity8 , and like every year i immediately went to @entity5 and practiced on center court			1
it feels like it is a normal year , but there 's something different			1
@entity1 : what does the @entity5 mean to you ? @entity27 : it means everything			1
it is here that everything happened to me			0
i have a love relationship with this tournament , since the first time i came here and over the years i think everything came together , the tournament , the fans and i , all having this love affair			1
i have so much respect for the tournament			1
for me it is the most important tournament in the world			1
all these years on the tour , i always worked out my schedule towards @entity5			1
@entity1 : what are your favorite memories of @entity5 ? @entity27 : it is very hard to pick just one , because everywhere i go here i have memories , even going back to the junior years			1
if i had to pick one match though , it would be the one against @entity79 , in the 4th round in 2001 , when i drew the heart [ on the court ] for the first time			0
it was just an amazing feeling			0
after i won the match i felt like i was floating , a feeling that is very , very hard to find			2
@entity1 : how does the event compare to the other @entity89 tournaments ? what makes it unique ? @entity27 : for me i ca n't even compare			2
everybody asked me over the years if i wanted to win @entity93 , the @entity94 or @entity95 ... of course you want to win , but i would rather have won even more @entity5 than these other @entity89			1
i think it is a combination of it being in @entity8 , being played on clay , the people and the courts			0
even the clay in @entity5 i think is unique ; it is different from any other clay court in the world			1
@entity1 : what do the crowds in @entity8 mean to you ? will you draw another heart in the clay when you finally leave the court ? @entity27 : i am not a guy who plans these things ahead			2
i like things to come naturally			0
even when i drew the heart , it was something spontaneous and it ended up being something very special , that showed all the love i have for the tournament and the crowd			2
i know they are expecting me to speak some @entity124 , so i am trying to practice a little this week , but i do n't really know ... let 's see how it goes			0
@entity1 : what else would you have like to have achieved in tennis ? @entity27 : i could n't ask for anything else			0
i have achieved much more than i could ever expect			0
even in my wildest dreams i could n't imagine that i would win @entity5 three times , win the @entity133 and become the number one tennis player in the world ... @entity1 : you 're a national hero in @entity137			1
how does it feel to go back home ? @entity27 : i love being in @entity137			0
many people asked me why i did n't buy a house in @entity142 , or somewhere else , but i never wanted to live outside @entity137			0
i come from an island , a small city in the south of @entity137 and people are used to seeing me there			0
of course when i go to bigger cities , i stop for autographs , pictures , sometimes there is a crowd , but it 's ok , it 's satisfying			0
in the beginning i did n't really feel like an idol , but i learnt to deal with it and i feel proud to be an example and that people feel inspired by me			0
@entity1 : what will you miss most from giving up tennis ? @entity27 : ah , the competition for sure ... i am a very competitive guy			0
the one thing i wo n't miss though is all the traveling			0
@entity1 : what happens when the tennis stops ? @entity27 : first i want to take a couple of months off , just to relax , surf and think what i want to do			0
but i definitely want to be involved with tennis , help develop tennis in @entity137 and do more work for my institute , the @entity174			0
