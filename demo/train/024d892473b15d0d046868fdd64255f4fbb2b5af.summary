-- on wednesday night , @entity1 brought together an all - star lineup for a benefit concert to help those in @entity5 recover from last week 's devastating tornado			1
the event , called " healing in the @entity8 , " was held in front of a sold - out crowd at @entity12 's @entity11 , and broadcast on @entity13			1
@entity1 , a coach on the network 's singing competition " @entity16 , " tapped fellow @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 of @entity20 to perform alongside @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity1 's wife , @entity25			1
@entity26 gave a particularly emotional performance during the telethon , as she choked up in the middle of her song , " @entity31			1
" the lauded country artist made it about halfway through before tears overtook her ability to sing , and the audience cheered their support and stepped in to carry the song until @entity26 could continue			2
her husband joined his fellow " @entity16 " coach @entity21 to close out the show with another poignant performance , this time of @entity45 © 's " home			1
" " i 'm here tonight with some of my closest friends from @entity50 and beyond to join in and help with the rebuilding and recovery of this land that means so much to me , " @entity1 said during the concert , which carried on in the midst of another severe weather threat			1
@entity17 , for one , was n't going to let that stop him from his mission of uplift			2
" i told somebody tonight , i said , ' well , if another one comes and they tear some more stuff down , we 'll help ' em build that back up , too ! ' " the country singer said with a laugh			2
@entity66 is from the area , having grown up roughly 10 miles north of where a monstrous tornado ripped through @entity70 , @entity5 , on may 20 , leaving 24 dead , including nine children			1
" your heart hurts for those people and those kids who got killed			2
... it rips your guts out every time , " @entity66 said			0
" they 're struggling and they 've lost everything they have , a lot of people			0
their homes , their possessions , their pictures and their whole history is gone in a flash			0
you ca n't do anything but reach out and say , ' we 're here			0
' " money raised during the telethon is going to the @entity95 of @entity5 's relief fund			1
if there 's a silver lining to be found , @entity66 said , it is in the humanity seen during a crisis			1
" when times are tough like this , people step up and help each other			0
it 's a human element and a human touch and it 's awesome to see that , " he said			2
@entity20 's @entity19 , who grew up in @entity111 , @entity5 , said he hopes those who watched the show " will take away just the overwhelming sense of pride in the state of @entity5 , and the people			1
i mean , these are the nicest people on @entity119 , " he told @entity0			0
" i 've lived all over the country now , and the one consistent thing that every different state says about @entity50 is , ' yeah , i went there once			0
i drove to @entity111 , i went here , i stayed there			0
nicest people i 've ever met , they 'd give you the shirt of their back			0
' and that is the nature of @entity130			0
... and i think the whole country sees it			0
