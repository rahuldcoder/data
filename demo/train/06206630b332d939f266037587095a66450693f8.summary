-- in the past month i 've eaten poached goat , grilled octopus , the breaded and fried thymus gland of a cow , tagliatelle with rabbit ragu , and the seared liver of a fatted goose			1
in the past 24 hours , i 've had pulled - pork tacos with pickled onions , blindingly spicy @entity13 noodles , caramelized @entity15 sprouts , and a deep - fried candy bar			1
for dinner i 'll be grilling a molasses - brined pork loin -- unless i simmer a garlicky cellini bean soup topped with a poached egg			1
whatever ends up on my plate , i know i 'll enjoy it			1
that 's what i do with food			2
@entity0 : 4 food blogs we love i 'm from a region -- between the @entity29 and @entity30 -- that 's riddled with farmers ' markets , an area where @entity36 or @entity37 cuisine is as plentiful as burgers , and where culinary legends ( @entity40 , the @entity42 @entity41 and @entity43 ) and hidden - gem restaurants ( @entity46 's @entity45 , @entity48 's @entity47 ) abound			1
all that foodie culture leaves its mark : i learned to love frisée and arugula before my training wheels came off			2
but if the area 's epicurean quotient is steep , so is its cost of living			2
when i was growing up , my parents struggled , and to supplement the high - end delicacies , we did what most broke people do : ate junk food			1
whenever i fly home from @entity65 , i head to @entity66 straight from the airport			2
i covet @entity69 's chicken planks			2
and @entity70 help me if i spot a @entity71			0
in my cabinets you 'll find @entity74 , boxed mac and cheese ( best served studded with hot dog chunks ) , and six flavors of potato chips -- none of them low fat			0
@entity0 : eat like a foodie without leaving the house now seems a good time to mention my butt , boobs , and stomach , which are ample			0
i 'd rather have curves than agonize over whether i deserve dessert			1
plus , i look great in vintage dresses , and , according to at least one small child , my hugs are pleasantly " squishy			0
" my trunk is not so junk - filled that it ca n't fit into an airplane seat -- which is lucky , since one of my goals in life is to eat everywhere i can			1
@entity0 : how to eat in your 20s , 30s , 40s , 50s and beyond i prep for vacations by slavering over restaurant websites ( i call it menu porn )			0
last fall , for instance , long before landing in @entity106 , i knew i 'd be ordering the white truffle risotto at @entity109 and the @entity111 cocktail at the @entity112			1
but i welcome serendipity , too			0
the best moment of that trip came at @entity116 , a funky @entity118 watering hole			0
@entity0 : get the skinny on fat my husband and i bit into our soft - shell - crab po'boys and gasped			1
the sandwiches were perfect -- crunchy , crabby , drenched in piquant mayonnaise			0
that bite had everything i love about food : the joy , the hedonism ( it was a lot of mayo ) , and the makings of a story ( it 's ridiculous how often we discuss those damn po'boys )			0
i 'd never want to miss out on any of that -- or the dessert of @entity139 we served ourselves later			1
