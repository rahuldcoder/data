-- @entity2 's preparations for the @entity3 later this month have suffered a worrying setback as the world number two was forced to withdraw from this week 's @entity6			1
@entity2 has suffered a recurrence of the right arm injury which hindered him at the @entity10 three weeks ago , but was apparently healed			1
he is still hoping to be fit for the @entity11 which starts next sunday			2
" i am very sorry for the @entity6 tournament and all the @entity16 fans to have to pull out of the @entity6 , " said @entity2 told the official @entity13 website sunday			1
" i did everything possible in order to play in @entity6 , which is one of the biggest events of the year , but unfortunately my right arm injury has flared up again			1
" now i will take some time to recover and heal my injury , hoping i will be ready for @entity11			2
i look forward to returning to @entity6 next year			1
" the @entity23 won in @entity6 three years ago during his triumphant 2011 season and was looking for a repeat at @entity26 in the @entity16 capital			1
his absence may pave the way for world number @entity30 to make a successful defense of his @entity6 title but he has also been far from dominant in recent weeks			1
defeats to fellow @entity16 @entity35 and @entity36 in @entity10 and @entity37 were unexpected , but @entity30 is shrugging them off			1
" i 've already said it several times			0
i did n't try to win @entity10 12 times or @entity37 12 times			1
maybe that is n't normal			0
this is the reality of the situation , " he said ahead of the @entity6 tournament			2
" maybe it 's normal to lose three times in the quarterfinals			0
maybe what 's not normal is what happened during the past nine years			0
" @entity30 beat @entity10 winner @entity50 in last year 's final and believes he can go all the way again this year			2
" i 'm here to fight and to try to play even better , " said @entity30			0
" i do n't think i have to change many things			0
i think i can change very small things , and the change can be quite drastic and quite big			0
that 's what i 'm working on right now			0
" meanwhile in the @entity59 event in @entity6 , @entity57 continued her superb recent form as she routed @entity61 in the first round			2
@entity57 , who won her 30th @entity59 title in such impressive style in @entity65 last week , beat @entity66 6 - 1 6 - 2			0
in the women 's doubles tournament , @entity67 rolled back the years again as she paired with @entity71 's @entity70 to beat seventh seeds @entity72 and @entity74 in a first round clash			0
they were a set then 4 - 1 down in the match tie - break before going through 3 - 6 6 - 2 10 - 6 victory			0
but there was sad news released late on sunday , with the announcement that former top 50 @entity59 player and @entity85 @entity84 has died aged 30			1
@entity84 was diagnosed with liver cancer in january , just two months after retiring from tennis and only weeks after she married her long - time coach @entity88			1
" we are heartbroken beyond words , " @entity88 said in a statement released by her family			0
@entity84 was the daughter of former football star @entity94 , who starred for @entity95 in the @entity97 top - flight after playing for the old @entity98 .			2
