several mass graves have been discovered , at least 1,000 people are dead and tens of thousands have been displaced in @entity3 as a recent outbreak of inter-ethnic violence has @entity7 's newest nation on the brink of civil war and possibly genocide			1
at the time of @entity3 's independence in july of 2011 -- free from @entity3 and recovering from decades of civil war -- hopes were high			1
southern @entity15 referred to their new country as the @entity18			0
there were fears that @entity3 might seek to undermine the new nation 's stability , but analysts cautioned the greatest threats to peace could come from within the country 's own borders			1
as tensions rise between the @entity3 's two largest ethnic groups , the @entity30 and @entity31 , commentators are now recalling the events in @entity33 with reference to this crisis			1
twenty years ago , in the @entity37 of 1994 , reports warned of the threat of genocide in @entity33 as the radical @entity41 government incited hatred against the @entity43			1
less than six months later , the government of @entity33 had organized the murder of their @entity43 civilians , leaving around a million dead			2
preventing a devastating civil war from gripping @entity3 is urgent , but focus must also be given to preventing genocide , which is a high risk should instability in the country deepen			1
the intentional nature of genocide and the attempt to destroy groups based on their ethnic , religious or national identity , make it a uniquely horrific crime and one that the international community has committed itself to prevent and punish			2
fear of escalating violence in @entity3 has led the @entity64 @entity63 to increase the peace - keeping operation in @entity3 by a further 5,500 personnel			2
in the experience of one of the authors , who lost many of his family in @entity33 1994 , they are right to do so			2
according to genocide scholar , @entity73 , the risk of mass atrocities increases with political instability , the existence of an autocratic regime , a dominating ethnic group and previous genocide or massacres			0
all of these factors were present in @entity33 preceding the genocide and are now present in @entity3			1
should @entity3 become entrenched in civil war , the risk of mass atrocities occurring will increase significantly			1
while the parallels between @entity33 and @entity3 are not identical , they share some of the same warning signs , which we have outlined below : the current crisis in @entity3 began as a power struggle between president @entity94 , originating from @entity3 's @entity30 majority , and its former vice president @entity96 of the @entity31 tribe			1
@entity96 was ousted from his position by @entity94 in july along with the rest of the cabinet			0
the situation came to a violent head on december 15 when rival army factions loyal to the two leaders first clashed in the country 's capital of @entity107			0
the conflict has since spread throughout several states			0
both sides have been accused of targeting members of the opposing ethnic group			0
while different in the detail , power struggles mixed with an ethnic dimension was a feature in @entity33 in 1994			2
aside from the civil war , in which the @entity43 dominated @entity119 were attempting to oust the @entity121 government , there was an extremist factions within the ruling @entity41 regime who consolidated its power by killing many @entity41 opposition members as that same time as the genocide against the @entity43 began			1
massacres have already taken place in @entity3			0
as we saw in @entity33 , massacres of @entity43 occurred long before all out genocide , but failed to be seem as an alarm			2
in @entity3 , the discovery of one mass grave in the town of @entity137 and two more outside of the capital should be viewed as indication of what could continue or escalate if the situation stays on its current trajectory			0
in a concerning development , an armed rebel militia has now entered the fray in @entity3			0
the militia -- known as the " @entity148 " for dusting their bodies with ash -- is reportedly composed of 25,000 @entity31 youth and is suspected of being aligned with the rebel army and @entity96			0
the @entity148 attacked a @entity64 peacekeeping base that was sheltering civilians , killing several peacekeepers on december 19			0
the group has been known to make statements about their intent to wipe out members of rival ethnic groups			0
in @entity33 , a militia aligned with the @entity41 - led government known as the @entity163 , expressed a similar ideology to the @entity148 and was harnessed by the political leaders to commit genocide			2
the root causes of the crisis in @entity3 are deep set , but not insurmountable			0
while there are differences in the context of the two crises , @entity33 's not too distant past provides a warning that there is no time for complacency in @entity3			1
but , we should not only look back 20 years for lessons			0
@entity3 should look to @entity33 20 years after the genocide to see how governance , rule of law and leadership have enabled development			1
@entity3 could learn also how in @entity33 , resilience against violence is being reinforced at a community level through peace education that works to overcome the hostility and fear between groups and to develop an identity and purpose based not on tribe , but on the nation			1
to do this takes true leadership from all concerned			0
let us hope , that for the sake of @entity3 's people , their leaders will not come to realize the solution to creating sustainable peace after countless dead have been buried			2

@entity7 's newest nation , @entity3 , is on the brink of civil war and possibly genocide
the violence in @entity3 has many *likening* it to the @entity33 genocide of 1994
*survivor* @entity221 says the two situations have many similar warning signs
to overcome risk of civil war @entity3 must develop a national not tribal identity
