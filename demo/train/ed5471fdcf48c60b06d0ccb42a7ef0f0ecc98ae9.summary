-- @entity1 is the fifth richest country in the world			1
it is the world 's sixth largest exporter			2
it has the second largest diplomatic network in the world , after the @entity7			0
it is a member of the @entity9			0
it is the most visited country in the world , welcoming 82 million visitors last year			2
it is a major nuclear power			0
it is the true founder of the @entity14			0
and it is in a terrible mess			0
socialist @entity18 was elected president almost a year ago , ousting the deeply unpopular " mr @entity21 , " president @entity17			1
read more : @entity18 - @entity22 @entity1 's socialist left have never been so strong politically : they control the presidency , the government , both houses of parliament , the regions , and all the big towns and cities			1
and in his first eight months in office , @entity18 has done virtually nothing			1
he is like a stunned bunny in the headlights of an oncoming vehicle called " @entity37			1
" @entity18 has three fundamental problems			1
the first is that he does n't have a plan			0
tens of thousands of people are losing their jobs each week , and it is going to get worse and worse			0
@entity1 faces a huge public spending crisis - in health , pensions , and now welfare , and a government debt of 90 % of gdp			1
not one single adequate measure has been put forward , nor even proposed in his eight months in office			0
read more : what @entity18 's victory means for @entity57 's economy the second problem is that he lacks the political will to break the log - jams in @entity1 society : making industry more competitive , reducing government spending			1
he can not do these things because one of the constituencies he needs to take on -- the huge public sector -- is made up of the people who voted him into power			2
he could take on the equally irresponsible banks -- they did n't vote for him -- but he risks sending the economy into a tailspin if he does			0
and not only does he need to address the structural issues in @entity1 's economy and society , but he made the mistake of telling everyone he could solve the country 's problems painlessly , or by taxing the super-rich , and he is not managing to do that either , so he is just taxing everyone else			1
read more : @entity82 ois @entity18 : left turn for @entity1 ? now he faces the worst situation possible because no one believes a word he says			1
he delivered a robust @entity88 's message last week , watched by millions ; yet 75 % do n't believe he can deliver on its promise			2
in fact , the @entity91 wishes everyone in @entity1 did believe were the churchillian tones of @entity96 chancellor @entity95			1
her message was essentially the opposite of @entity18 's bizarre optimism , which seems to involve little more than following the " @entity101 " mantra			1
but waiting for the upturn will find @entity1 unprepared and in a worse predicament than @entity104 or @entity105 , who are now busily restructuring their economies			1
the third and fundamental problem @entity18 has is that he does not understand the nature of the office he holds , the @entity110			1
if he did , he might find a way forward			0
in his @entity88 message he likened himself to a ship 's captain			2
but he has to be one , not just say he is one			0
the office of @entity1 president is a highly complex mixture of the political and the symbolic			1
but it is fundamentally about leadership ; that is leading not following , and taking the @entity1 with him			2
@entity18 urgently needs to reset his @entity122 - and there are a few clear rules to do so : he needs to take on the banks where necessary , take on the benefits system , the impediments to innovation and to setting up new businesses , take on the appalling situation of @entity1 's forgotten inner city misery ; his need not be a hard - nosed liberal agenda			1
no government in @entity1 history is in a better position to make @entity1 a more equal society while making it and its economy more efficient			1
he should focus on young people trying to set up their own business			0
focus on small businesses generally			0
@entity142 away from its drive to over regulate everything and throttle innovation			0
tax the super-rich if necessary , as long as it contributes to the overall solution he is aiming for			0
he also needs to get into step with @entity95 and lead @entity57 with @entity96 , not pretend he is the spokesperson for the irresponsible spenders			0
but above all , he should use the presidency in a more imaginative way : begin an ongoing and exciting conversation with the @entity1			2
no other office in the world , not even the presidency of the @entity7 , offers such scope for an intimacy between leader and population			0
he should boldly use the referendum to build up and direct the conversation towards change and innovation			0
if the vested interests wo n't move , bring in the people			0
use the referendum like @entity172 did between 1958 and 1962 , as a major political weapon to break the deadlocks in @entity1 political society			2
in @entity57 and the wider world he has to make @entity1 admired again , as it once was			1
inside @entity1 , he has to forget about not upsetting anyone			2
in fact , he should have a plan that upsets just about everybody			0
the @entity1 would love him for it			2
so far it remains to be seen what impact his first major foreign policy challenge -- in @entity185 -- will have			0
as @entity1 forces , with the backing of the international community , go into the @entity191 country to take on @entity193 rebels , the coming weeks will tell us whether fate just gave to him the best or the worst opportunity to show the @entity1 , and the rest of the world , what he is made of			1
read more : @entity1 : we 're not the pacifists you think we are the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			1

@entity1 president @entity18 and the country 's @entity208 are in a strong position
despite this , @entity18 has made little progress since his election , says @entity206
@entity206 : @entity18 " like a stunned bunny in the headlights " of economic reality
president must act now , and act *decisively* , to make @entity1 admired again , says @entity206
