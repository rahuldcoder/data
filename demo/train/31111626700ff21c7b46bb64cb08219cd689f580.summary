-- outgoing " @entity2 " host @entity1 congratulated his replacement @entity4 at the start of his opening monologue on wednesday night , while taking another swipe at the @entity9 executives that are showing him the door			1
" i just have one request of @entity4			2
we 've all fought , kicked and scratched to get this network up to fifth place , okay ? now we have to keep it there			0
" @entity4 do n't let it slip into sixth			2
we 're counting on you			0
" @entity1 will wrap up his 22 - year run as host in spring 2014 , with @entity4 officially signing on as his replacement			1
according to a statement from @entity9 , " as part of the transition , ' @entity2 ' will be returning to its original home in @entity27 in @entity28 " from @entity1 's base of @entity31			1
@entity28 gov. @entity32 praised the move , saying in a statement " on behalf of all @entity28 " that he 's " pleased to welcome ' @entity2 ' back to its first home			1
" when it began in 1954 , the " original ' @entity2 ' ushered in the modern era of television , " @entity32 continued			2
" it is only fitting that as ' @entity2 ' returns to our state , it will be headlined by @entity28 's own native son and resident , @entity4			1
" opinion : how @entity47 helped @entity48 get @entity1 's job the expectation that @entity1 would leave @entity9 's legendary late - night program has been building recently , and @entity48 's appointment is n't surprising in the least			1
he 's had a swift rise to " tonight 's " chair , having hosted " @entity55 " for just four years , but @entity48 's transition was treated as such a near certainty that both hosts worked the headlines into their nightly routines			0
while @entity48 initially downplayed the rumors , @entity1 went after his employer on a regular basis			0
he 's compared @entity9 executives to snakes , joked about the network 's sagging ratings and kidded that the rumored late - night shuffle was like @entity9 's version of @entity70			0
just two days before the big announcement , @entity48 and @entity1 again made light of the reports with a parody of the song " tonight " from the musical " @entity76			1
" with @entity1 's contract set to expire in fall 2014 , industry observers said the move was only a matter of time			1
@entity1 first exited " tonight " in 2009 after 17 years as host , passing the torch to @entity84 , who was then the host of " @entity55			1
" @entity1 was moved to prime time with his own program , " the @entity89 , " in the fall of 2009			1
but when that brought dismal ratings , @entity9 decided to put @entity1 back in charge of " tonight " at the start of 2010 , leaving @entity84 without a job			1
the flame - haired comedian eventually moved to @entity96 to host his own show , " @entity98 , " in the 11 p.m. hour , but the entire scenario generated ill will toward @entity1 and @entity9			1
( @entity96 shares a parent company with @entity0			0
) yet as the years went on , @entity1 has proved to be resilient			0
as @entity9 's prime - time ratings suffered , @entity1 's " @entity2 " was still able to rise above the rest in its time slot			1
at the end of march , " @entity2 " hit a seven - week high in total viewers , with 3.52 million watching			0
however , @entity9 was said to be concerned about losing younger viewers to @entity109 's @entity108 , whose " @entity113 " was moved up to compete with @entity1 and @entity111 's " @entity110 " at the beginning of 2013			2
" the more time @entity108 is in that slot , the more the young audience goes that way , the harder it is for ( @entity48 ) to keep that audience , " one source familiar with the network 's thought process told @entity117 in march			0
at 62 years old , @entity1 represents a more traditional form of hosting , as he 's known for his " @entity127 - style comedy , " said the @entity128			2
@entity48 , 38 , regularly incorporates the @entity129 and social media into his act , offering " a more contemporary and varied brand of entertainment , " the @entity128 said			0
this changing of the guard is one of the most closely watched exercises in pop culture , especially as it takes place at one of tv 's mainstay productions			0
even with its decline in ratings over the years , it remains a solid profit center for @entity9 , making between $ 25 million and $ 40 million for the network , according to the @entity128			0
although it 's been on the air for almost 60 years , " @entity2 " has had just a handful of regular hosts : @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity1 and @entity84			1
" @entity2 " is n't what it was during the long tenure of @entity155 , who hosted the show from 1962 until 1992			2
in those three - network times , @entity155 dominated late - night tv like nobody before or since			0
he dominated the ratings and routinely sat down challengers like so many duck targets at a carnival shooting gallery			0
@entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 -- they all tried to dethrone the king , and they all came up short			0
@entity155 sat behind " tonight 's " desk for 30 years before passing the torch to @entity1 , and " @entity155 " is still the model against whom all are measured			1
interestingly enough , " @entity55 " producer @entity179 , who 's now executive producer of " @entity2 , " has called @entity48 " the closest thing " this generation has to @entity155			2
it appears it 's now time for @entity48 to show and prove .			0

@entity1 announced wednesday that he 's leaving ' tonight '
@entity4 will replace him in spring 2014
@entity1 first left the show in 2009 but returned after his new show failed
the new " @entity2 " will also return to @entity28
