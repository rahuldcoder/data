editor 's note : @entity2 , executive editor of the film web site @entity4 , is an online film critic based in @entity5 , @entity6			1

@entity2 says activists are making outlandish demands of a film that parodies @entity11			1
@entity5 , @entity6 ( @entity12 ) -- it is hard to imagine that @entity16 and @entity17 , the companies behind " @entity15 , " did not foresee some sort of reaction from activist groups			1
with a film that attacks on all levels , making jokes at the expense of race , obesity and cognitive disabilities , the executives must have known it would n't sail smoothly in and out of theaters			0
that said , the reaction we 've seen from activist groups in defense of the cognitively disabled has been astounding			1
the @entity35 has gone beyond expressing their disapproval of the film in order to lay out a list of demands			2
among those demands is that director @entity42 re-cut the film , modifying it to remove any reference to the word " retard " and any other " disrespectful depictions " from the film before it hits theaters this week			2
and those appear to be the simplest of their demands			0
everyone has a right to be offended and to speak out against such an offense			0
the real issue concerning this debacle is whether groups should be drumming up public outrage and making outlandish demands of a @entity11 studio based on a movie , especially one that is clearly a parody of the @entity11 system itself			1
the answer is no. while i can personally empathize with groups who feel that some of the content in " @entity15 " is offensive , it 's hard to remain on their side when their otherwise reasonable argument turns into an overblown campaign against the insensitivities of the entire entertainment business			1
to imply that by not capitulating to group demands , @entity16 and @entity17 are in large part responsible for intolerance toward the cognitively disabled is ludicrous			2
real intolerance is bred in homes , where parents fail to provide proper direction for their children , fail to place such things into the context of everyday life and fail to show their children the difference between right and wrong			0
on top of this is the issue of the film 's r - rating			1
as often as critics in the entertainment world , myself included , have railed on the unfair practices of the @entity102 , it is easy to see that their ratings system does work in some cases			0
in this case , the r - rating works as a warning : audiences who see " @entity15 " are in for an experience that is only intended for adults			1
adults should have the ability to process the jokes employed by " @entity15 " within the context of the film and recognize that the joke does n't target those with disabilities			1
it satirically takes aim at actors who exploit roles in which they play disabled characters in order to garner acclaim and win awards			0
since children might not be able to make that connection or understand that context , the r - rating serves a strong role			1
perhaps the only major mistake by the studio was in placing the " @entity15 " concept in the marketing campaign			2
in the film , the joke truly fades into the context of the storyline , but when pulled out of that context , it is left standing on a burning platform that could easily be interpreted as blatant insensitivity			0
but they have admitted that mistake and rectified it by removing the " @entity15 " web site			2
ireport.com : share your thoughts on ' @entity15 ' beyond that , the film itself keeps everything in the context of the joke , something that seems to be lost on activist groups			1
in fact , if those members of the cognitively disabled community are claiming that this is n't how they would like to be portrayed , perhaps they 'll actually find themselves agreeing with the film upon viewing -- a film that mocks actors who choose to exploit portrayals of those with cognitive disabilities			0
while groups still have every right to be upset over the use of the word " retard " or any other " disrespectful depictions , " it is the nature of their response that should be questioned			0
being upset about a movie is one thing , but holding @entity11 responsible for intolerance in @entity179 is something altogether different			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .			0

@entity2 : *filmmakers* must have known " @entity15 " would be *controversial*
demands made by activist groups are over the top , @entity2 says
the film is a satire aimed at @entity11 , not at disabled *people* , he says
@entity2 : the r - rating means film will be seen by adults who can understand it
