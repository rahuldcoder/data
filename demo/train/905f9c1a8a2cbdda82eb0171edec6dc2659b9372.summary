-- days after @entity2 and the @entity3 reached a deal on getting @entity5 to give up its chemical weapons , world powers are quarreling over the details			1
the agreement , reached by @entity2 foreign minister @entity9 and @entity3 secretary of state @entity10 over the weekend , calls for a @entity12 resolution demanding that @entity5 turn over its chemical weapons to international control in a specific time frame			1
@entity2 wo n't support any resolution that would authorize the use of force against @entity5 if it does n't comply , @entity9 said tuesday			1
but the @entity3 and @entity18 want to keep the threat of force on the table if @entity5 does n't comply			1
those allies say they are convinced that @entity5 president @entity24 's regime was behind a chemical weapons attack in opposition areas that , according to @entity3 estimates , killed more than 1,400 people			1
representatives of those three powers and the two other veto - wielding permanent @entity32 members met behind closed doors at the @entity12 on tuesday to hammer out a draft resolution , a meeting a @entity12 diplomat called " constructive			1
" " for the first time there was a discussion of the actual text , " said the diplomat , who did n't want to be named discussing ongoing private negotiations			0
" there are well - known different views on some of the elements , but we are trying to resolve those issues			0
" the meetings were likely to resume wednesday , the diplomat said			0
@entity12 weapons inspectors reported monday that an august 21 attack outside @entity50 had been carried out using the nerve gas sarin			1
tuesday , @entity52 ban ki - moon said the findings should spur member states to bring the bloodshed in @entity5 to a halt , urging both @entity57 and @entity58 to " demonstrate their leadership			1
" " let us be clear : the use of chemical weapons in @entity5 is only the tip of the iceberg , " he said			2
" the suffering in @entity5 must end			2
" though the inspectors did not assign blame for the attack , a @entity3 analysis of their report shows the @entity5 regime was responsible for the august 21 massacre outside @entity50 , @entity68 spokeswoman @entity67 told reporters in @entity57			1
" based on our preliminary review of information contained in the report , several crucial details confirm the @entity24 regime 's guilt in carrying out this attack , " she said			2
one of the munitions identified in the report , a 120 - millimeter improvised rocket , has been linked to previous attacks by the @entity24 regime , and " we have no indications that the opposition has manufactured or used this style rocket			2
" in addition , the environmental , chemical , and medical samples collected by @entity12 investigators " provide clear and compelling evidence " that the rockets used in the attack contained sarin gas , a nerve agent , she said			2
" we know the regime possesses sarin ; we have no evidence , however , that the opposition possesses sarin			2
" she added that the @entity3 reserves the right to take military action			2
though diplomacy is the preferred option , " i do n't want to predict what the end result will be , " she said			0
still , she was willing to predict that that end result would not include the status quo in @entity50			0
" we do n't see a future for @entity24 , a future in @entity5 that includes @entity24 , " she said			1
international inspections of @entity5 's declared chemical weapons storage sites are to begin next month and all chemical weapons are to be eliminated by june 30 , 2014 , she said			1
@entity18 foreign minister @entity121 shared @entity67 's view that the @entity5 regime was responsible for the massacre			1
but , at the same news conference , @entity9 brushed aside a question about blame			0
he noted that the @entity12 inspectors in @entity5 were not tasked with figuring out who was responsible and that that was not the point of the @entity12 report			1
@entity2 has suggested @entity5 rebels may have been behind the attack , though critics have said rebels did not have the means to unleash chemical weapons			1
a scathing report inspectors found " clear and convincing evidence " that the nerve agent sarin was delivered by surface - to - surface rockets " on a relatively large scale " in the august 21 attack on a @entity50 suburb , @entity140 said monday			2
" it is the most significant confirmed use of chemical weapons against civilians since @entity159 used them in @entity160 in 1988 , " @entity140 said , referring to the chemical attack against @entity149 in northern @entity150 that killed thousands , mostly civilians , " and the worst use of weapons of mass destruction in the 21st century , " @entity140 said			0
" the international community has a responsibility to ensure that chemical weapons never re-emerge as an instrument of warfare			0
" but on tuesday , @entity140 said it was " for others to decide whether to pursue this matter further to determine responsibility and accountability			0
" the diplomatic quarrel over just who may have been responsible for the chemical weapons attack came as the toll from conventional weapons continued to mount			0
the opposition @entity175 reported that 70 people -- including four children and seven women -- were killed tuesday nationwide			0
@entity5 - @entity180 border tension a blast rocked the @entity5 side of the @entity180 - @entity5 border tuesday , @entity180 's semiofficial @entity182 news agency reported			1
video shot by activists showed torrents of black smoke emerging from blazing vehicles at the crossing as survivors tried to help victims			0
the @entity175 said the attack wounded many people			0
the explosion , which happened near a border gate , comes a day after @entity180 planes shot down a @entity5 helicopter crossing into @entity180			0
it came down on @entity5 territory , @entity180 deputy prime minister @entity200 said			0
@entity5 's state news agency @entity203 said the helicopter was watching for " terrorists " crossing the border and erroneously strayed into @entity180 airspace , but was on its way back across the border when shot down			1
@entity0 's @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215 contributed to this report .			0
