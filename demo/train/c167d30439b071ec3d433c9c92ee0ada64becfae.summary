@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 prosecutors ' decision to seize @entity7 funds as part of an investigation into possible money - laundering was correct , an @entity1 court ruled wednesday			1
the @entity11 expressed " surprise " that its appeal had been rejected and stood by its position that the investigation was the result of a misunderstanding			1
@entity1 prosecutors last month froze @entity11 bank transactions for the first time ever , after the bank failed to provide all the information required by anti-money laundering rules			1
prosecutors seized 23 million euros ( about $ 30 million ) in @entity25 bank transactions " as a cautionary measure , " prosecutor @entity24 told @entity2 in september			1
pope @entity27 personally told the director of the @entity7 that he trusted him and appreciates the work he is doing , the @entity11 said the day after they met on september 26			1
@entity31 , the bank head , was among the faithful meeting @entity27 that day after the pope 's weekly @entity34 address			1
@entity31 kissed the pope 's hand and gave him a copy of his book " money and @entity41 , " and they exchanged a few words , the @entity11 said			1
@entity31 told @entity2 before the meeting with the pope that he was incredulous and " humiliated " when he learned @entity1 investigators were looking into money - laundering allegations against the bank			1
he said the probe was the result of a " misunderstanding			0
" " my first reaction was of incredulity and afterwards , that of feeling humiliated in the intense work that , along with [ bank ] director - general [ @entity58 ] @entity57 and all of the institute 's managers , i 've been carrying out , " @entity31 told @entity2 by e-mail september 24			2
" after discussing with dr. @entity57 the actions that spurred the inquiry , i was relieved , and i 've realized that we had to immediately take action in explaining the facts to various levels and places , " he said			0
@entity31 said he also realized the need to speed up the process of getting the @entity7 on the " white list " of banks that comply with internationally agreed standards , " to prevent other misunderstanding events like the one that just happened			0
" this is not the first time @entity1 prosecutors have investigated the bank , but probes are extremely rare , @entity24 said			2
the probe began after another @entity1 bank informed @entity81 investigators of two @entity11 bank transactions that did not appear to comply with anti-money - laundering requirements , the @entity81 said			1
when @entity81 investigators told legal authorities about the transactions , they were told that judicial authorities were already investigating the @entity7 , a source close to the investigation said			0
the @entity7 is " the most secret bank in the world , " author @entity93 said after the funds were seized , and he said there is no way to find out how much money it controls			1
the @entity11 's sources of income include its vast real estate holdings , explained @entity93 , who wrote " @entity103 , " which looks at money laundering worldwide			1
the @entity81 investigation was prompted by two wire transfers that the @entity7 asked @entity107 to carry out , the @entity81 said			0
the @entity7 did not provide enough information about the transfers -- one for 20 million euros ( about $ 26 million ) and one for 3 million euros ( about $ 4 million ) -- to comply with the law , prompting the @entity81 to suspend them automatically , it said			2
it is not entirely clear how much legal authority @entity1 officials have over the @entity7 , since the @entity11 is a sovereign state			2
they had the power to seize the money and stop the transactions because they took place on @entity1 soil , said @entity24 , the prosecutor			0
an effort by @entity126 survivors to sue the @entity7 in the @entity127 failed in 2009 when a @entity127 court ruled that the @entity7 had " sovereign immunity " and was not subject to lawsuits filed in the @entity127			0
a lawsuit against related entities is still in court			0
the @entity7 was created by an order of the pope " to carry on activities that are for pious causes , " according to expert testimony related to the @entity126 suit			0
it accepts deposits only from top @entity143 officials and entities , @entity140 testified in @entity144 in 2006			0
it uses its funds " for designated pious purposes " and is " an autonomous pious foundation , " he said			0
@entity140 , a top @entity1 legal scholar who was called to testify by @entity11 lawyers , said the bank is an integral part of the @entity11 , a " central entity under the oversight of the @entity11			2
" it is ultimately overseen by a commission of five cardinals -- the top position in the @entity11 hierarchy below the pope -- which is headed by the @entity11 secretary of state			2
the @entity7 is subject to particularly stringent anti-money - laundering regulations because @entity1 law does not consider it to be operating within the @entity161			1
it must supply more detailed information about transactions than @entity161 banks have to give			0
@entity2 's @entity165 in @entity0 and @entity166 in @entity167 , @entity168 , contributed to this report .			0

the @entity11 says there was a misunderstanding and appealed against the seizure
