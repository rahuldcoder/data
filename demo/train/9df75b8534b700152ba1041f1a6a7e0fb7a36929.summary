the @entity9 's combined score of 130 over two days is the lowest 36 - hole score in the history of the @entity5			1
the record was previously held by @entity13 's @entity12 who carded 131 ( 65 and 66 ) over the first two rounds as he went on to win the @entity15 at the @entity17 's @entity16 in @entity18 , @entity19			2
" i played very well , " former world no. 1 @entity1 told the @entity5 website upon reaching the clubhouse			1
" i had some good rounds in the past as well			0
but yesterday and today , especially today , the way i worked my way around the course ... i hit some smart shots			0
" i did n't play too aggressive and when i had a good number , i went for the flag and i did n't make many mistakes on the greens			0
i did n't three putt , i made a lot of good putts today and yesterday			0
" at 10 under par , @entity1 was six shots clear of second - placed @entity37 @entity36 going into the weekend , as he seeks his second major title			1
@entity39 and @entity40 were a shot behind compatriot @entity36 at three - under - par while a group of five players including @entity44 and @entity45 were tied for fifth on two under			1
despite his considerable advantage @entity1 -- who won the @entity47 in 2010 and picked up the @entity48 at @entity49 last month -- refused to look beyond saturday , where he hopes to maintain his lead			2
" it 's not a done deal , " the world no. 28 said			1
" the last three , four holes , i got a little bit tired			0
i did n't swing as good as the first 14 holes			0
" @entity1 's wariness is perhaps understandable given a poor spell of form suffered over the last 18 months			2
but current world no. 1 @entity60 was less convinced by talk of @entity1 's perceived slow finish			1
" if he does it for two more days , then we 're all playing for second spot , " the @entity63 told reporters			0
@entity60 was tied for 14th position at level - par but still holds out a slim chance of catching the runaway leader			2
" we all know that @entity37 opens get very difficult and if i can just somehow put together two really good rounds , maybe slowly but surely i 'll creep my way up towards @entity1			2
" elsewhere on the course , two bogeys on the final three holes made for a disappointing finish for in - form young @entity37 @entity79 , who ended the day at one - under - par , nine off the pace			0
the 20 - year - old , who tied for second at the masters in april , was equal 10th alongside @entity12 ( 68 ) , world no. 5 @entity85 ( 70 ) and fellow @entity37 @entity88 ( 68 )			1
meanwhile , reigning @entity5 champion @entity89 shot a carded a 69 to finish the day at one - over - par after a difficult 72 on thursday			1
