-- as @entity3 pitcher @entity2 took to the mound monday night , he wore a rope - like necklace that may be nothing more than a fashion choice , but if he believes in the maker 's claims , that may give him an " edge " against his opponents at bat			1
it 's not just @entity2 ; a surprising number of professional athletes have begun wearing the titanium - laced necklaces , including @entity3 @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			1
the " edge " the necklaces ' manufacturer , @entity30 , claims to give is not proved , but especially for athletes , there is psychological value to an item worn consistently , rituals and superstitions , one sports psychologist says			1
" for athletes , there 's this unpredictability in sports			1
they never know how they 're going to play , how the other team is going to play , so when you do something that 's superstitious , like wearing a trinket , it gives you a greater sense of control , " said @entity35 , an author of " @entity36 " and professor of human performance at @entity38			2
some athletes ' rituals have been well documented : pitcher @entity49 wore a necklace made from the teeth of hunted animals			1
@entity53 famously wore his college shorts under his @entity56 uniforms ; third baseman @entity57 had to eat chicken before games and wrote the @entity62 symbol " chai , " meaning life , in the dirt before batting			1
the extra sense of control from the ritual leads to calmness , and calm leads to better performance , explains @entity35			0
whether there are any tangible , special properties in the lucky charm is just beside the point for a sports psychologist			1
fourteen - year - old baseball player @entity76 of @entity77 says he got his own @entity30 necklace when he was 11 , after watching the pros wear them			2
" last season , i forgot to wear it to a game , and i called my mom to go get it , because i refused to play without it , " @entity76 said			0
this season , he says , he views the necklace differently , but only slightly			0
" i probably would still play , but my mind would be all messed up			0
i probably would n't play as well			0
i probably would n't be focused on the game , because i 'd be thinking about not having it on			0
" his first necklace was the plain kind -- selling for $ 36 -- but now he has upgraded to the newer , larger twisted - rope " tornado , " which costs $ 50			2
@entity76 adds this self - observation : " i got it for the purpose of making me a better athlete , but now i use it just as a lucky charm			2
" @entity99 , an @entity56 strength and conditioning coordinator , says that he does n't intervene when high - performers find value in lucky charms			2
" when guys have a certain way of doing things , you do n't want to mess with that			0
" the @entity111 manufacturer says its products , which include bracelets worn by some pro golfers , do have a special technology that sets them apart			1
by fusing fabric with " a novel form of technology that involves metals broken down into microscopic particles dispersed in water " -- metals like titanium and gold -- @entity30 is " able to realize customers ' potentials in a variety of extents that leads to restore normal status of customers , " says the company 's website			1
claims like that -- and paid endorsements from 23 professional athletes in the @entity138 alone -- seem to be enough to convince many athletes that it 's better to be safe than sorry			1
better to be mistaken than without			0
" @entity30 has used a pseudoscientific appeal in marketing their products			0
they talk about ' micro-sized titanium spheres ' and other things that give the product the air of technology without any real science to back it up , " explains professor @entity144 of @entity145 , author of " believing in @entity147 : the @entity155			2
" the @entity156 , which represents @entity30 , could not provide any published studies finding a medical benefit from wearing its metal - infused necklaces and bracelets			1
" @entity162 players and others who engage in superstitious behaviors understanding that they have no scientific support are likely to say ' i just do n't want to take a chance , ' " @entity144 said			0
" and they get an emotional benefit from doing something that makes them feel like they have greater control			0
even when that feeling is an illusion			0
