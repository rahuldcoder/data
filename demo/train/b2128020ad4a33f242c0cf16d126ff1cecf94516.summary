editor 's note : @entity2 is following two student teams from the @entity4 as they work to improve the quality of life in @entity7			1
the student teams will be writing about their experiences for @entity2 throughout the summer			0
check back regularly for updates on their work			0
@entity2 first introduced the @entity12			0
it now introduces the @entity14			0
the views expressed in this article are not necessarily those of @entity17 or its affiliates			0
students visited slums to obtain data on the history of health and access to water in each household			1
( @entity17 ) -- the @entity27 reports that 88 percent of the 1.8 million deaths resulting from diarrhea can be attributed to unsafe water or inadequate hygiene or sanitation			2
unfortunately , a significant population in the city of @entity35 , @entity7 , fall victim to these causes , and they are not even aware of the cause			1
the @entity4 @entity40 and @entity14 is spending this summer implementing a project model that will improve these statistics in the community			1
the team of six students , visiting from the @entity4 , will guide a pilot project in the under - served community of @entity48			1
over the course of the next year , the @entity12 will employ local college students to maintain the program and monitor the efficiency of the water purification technology			1
and by subsidizing the cost for those living within @entity56 , the @entity12 will be providing state - of - the - art purification systems at affordable prices , creating an important sense of ownership and empowerment for the people			0
the team also plans to build awareness within the local community about the need to drink purified water			1
while the source of water currently received by the @entity71 is filtered , sewage leakage and the poor management of waste often contaminates drinking water on its way into the homes			2
this means that while the water from these pipes or the bore wells may look clean , it can be hazardous to drink			2
to compound the issue , even water contained in holding tanks on vehicles that visit the community is by no means guaranteed to be of sufficient , purified quality			1
the tanks carrying the water are rarely cleaned and the taps through which the water is dispersed may easily be contaminated			2
families must be aware that the water they are provided is harmful to their health and provides a catalyst for breeding mosquitoes carrying malaria and other transferable diseases			0
local reports have proven this , and communities in the past have fallen victim to water - related illnesses as a result of their consumption of unclean water			0
the @entity110 and @entity14 team hopes to shed light on this threatening issue , as confronting the challenge of dirty drinking water is a " gateway " step towards achieving measured , sustainable improvements in a wide array of serious health related issues			2
through education at key points of community influence and the measured introduction of new technologies that encourage responsibility over simply charity , the @entity12 will use its time in @entity35 to affect change that is both scalable and sustainable .			0
