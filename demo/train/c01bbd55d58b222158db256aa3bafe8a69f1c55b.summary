@entity0 -- it was a mystery for nearly 70 years : what happened to @entity6 leader @entity5 's diary , a valuable document with insights into the @entity9 ? @entity5 was the party 's chief ideologue and became a confidante of @entity13 after meeting him in 1921			1
he joined the party before @entity13 and gained fame writing anti-semitic tracts and editing the @entity6 newspaper			2
he eventually became head of the foreign policy office and was one of the chief architects of the plan to systematically exterminate @entity23			0
the influential @entity6 intellectual was convicted of war crimes at the @entity26 and hanged in october 1946			1
parts of his diary -- a loose - leaf collection of notes he kept from 1934 - 1944 were used by the tribunal , but the bulk of the diary , dating from 1936 - 1944 , went missing after the trial			1
the @entity40 , working with the @entity37 and investigators in @entity39 , finally solved the case , tracking down 400 missing pages of the diary			2
scholars hope it will help them learn more about how the @entity46 operated in the years before and during @entity47 " this is one of the great detective stories of our time			1
the diary was known at the time of the military tribunal in @entity56 when the leadership of the @entity6 was tried and it then disappeared for nearly 70 years , " ice director @entity52 told @entity1			1
" it was in fact smuggled out of @entity56 into the @entity60 , probably by @entity61 , who was one of the prosecutors for the @entity60 in @entity56			1
" investigators from the @entity64 and the @entity39 @entity66 's office received a tip in november 2012 from an unnamed " source " -- an art security specialist working with the @entity37 -- and were able to locate and seize the diary , according to a wednesday news release from @entity72 , the @entity60 attorney for the district of @entity39 , announcing the seizure , which took place in april			1
a criminal investigation is now under way to determine how the papers ended up in the possession of @entity80 , an academic in @entity81 , @entity82 , according to a government official			0
a @entity1 reporter 's calls to @entity80 seeking comment on the case were not returned			0
the yellowed pages of the diary -- some written on @entity6 stationery -- cover the lead - up to @entity47 and party activities during the war			1
containing frequent mentions of " @entity95 , " referring to @entity13 , they describe conflicts between @entity6 leaders like @entity98 and @entity99 -- the chief propagandist -- who battled over who was closest to @entity13			1
see pages of @entity5 's diary ( in @entity104 ) @entity61 , a @entity104 - @entity23 lawyer who fled to the @entity60 during the war and later returned to serve as the deputy chief counsel at @entity56 , removed the @entity5 diary from @entity60 government facilities and kept them until his death in 1993 , according to the release from the @entity39 @entity60 attorney 's office			1
according to a memo the @entity37 found among @entity116 's documents , @entity61 received permission from the @entity118 of @entity119 to keep unclassified documents " for purposes of writing , lecturing and study " as the trials drew to an end and he returned home with an unknown number of documents in his possession that were kept out of reach of other scholars			0
the press release from @entity72 's office stated the documents were removed " contrary to law and proper procedure			0
" @entity136 , an assistant @entity60 attorney who investigated the case , said @entity61 was not given title to the documents			0
" there would not have been any authority to do that because they were @entity60 government property , " @entity136 told @entity1			0
" the bottom line is they were improperly removed from government custody and retained by @entity116			0
now that the diary has been recovered , it will eventually be given to the @entity37 , where it will be accessible to scholars and the public			0
@entity5 also wrote in the diary about his plan to steal art and cultural treasures from all over @entity156			1
by the end of war , the task force he established had shipped almost 1.5 million rail car - loads of artwork and artifacts from @entity104 - controlled @entity156 to the @entity163 , according to the @entity37			2
@entity164 , who worked as chief archivist at the @entity37 for 16 years and now serves as a senior adviser there , spent 17 years looking for the diary and helped authenticate the papers after they were seized			2
experts have not yet been able to review all 400 pages , which were written in @entity104			2
in examining the papers , @entity164 and other researchers hope to learn more details about how @entity5 carried out his role as head of the @entity104 - controlled territories in @entity156 , including @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 and parts of @entity182 , where a large number of war crimes were committed			1
@entity164 said the diary provides insight into the mind of " another perpetrator who has given , so to speak , testimony or witness in his own hand about what was going on -- how he was administering the territory , how he felt about @entity23 and how he dealt with the @entity23 under his control			2
" @entity164 himself played an important role in finding the papers			0
he finally got a break during a visit to a storage locker where some of @entity116 's papers were being kept			0
while there he spoke with the sister of one of @entity116 's legal secretaries			0
" the person that i was with in the storage locker was the sister of one of the legal secretaries who since that time had passed away and she recalled that her sister was interviewed by a reporter from the @entity104 news magazine @entity214 and she told this reporter that she remembers that she gave the diary to somebody , a former academic who lived in both the @entity81 area and @entity219 , that she had given this diary to him -- quote - unquote -- for safekeeping , " he said , describing the " eureka " moment he experienced during that conversation			1
" at that moment we said ' ok now we know pretty much where this thing ended up and therefore we had a reason to go and pursue it , ok ? before then we only had surmised that it might have gone to him			0
" now that the long search is finally over , researchers like @entity164 will be able to delve deeper into the mind of a man who shared responsibility for murdering millions			0
