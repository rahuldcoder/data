" let 's rebuild @entity7 , " said the front page of @entity13 's @entity12 , over a photograph of a smiling @entity5 swearing the oath of office			1
" the promise , " said @entity17 , hailing the " @entity7 of @entity5			2
" " @entity19 , " said the @entity20 in the @entity21 -- a theme carried by many other newspapers worldwide -- while the @entity24 preferred : " @entity25			0
" the @entity26 showed a picture of @entity5 's seven - year - old daughter @entity28 giving her father the thumbs - up with the headline : " you 're the @entity33			1
" " at last it was the day , the hour , even the second that millions of @entity7 , " and not just @entity7 , have waited for impatiently ever since november , and in many cases for much longer than that			2
the crowds in @entity40 were extraordinary evidence of the momentous public potency of the moment , " the @entity37 gushed in its editorial			0
many international newspapers focused on the powerful symbolism and unifying power of the arrival of an @entity49 @entity7 president on the world stage			1
" we 're a nation of @entity58 and @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 -- and non-believers , " said the headline on the front of the @entity53 , taking a line from @entity5 's inaugural address			1
@entity64 's @entity63 said : " he is expected to play the leading role in changing the world in which racial and religious confrontations continue to rage in defiance of the ideal expressed in the @entity71			2
" " he is as much symbol as substance , an icon for the youth and a sign of deliverance for an older generation that never believed a man with his skin color would ascend those steps , " said the @entity72			0
but many papers urged @entity5 to get to work immediately to address the urgent problems already piled up up in his intray			1
" this was n't the occasion for his most soaring of speeches			0
it was instead an oration rooted in the immediate challenges			0
it was directed at two audiences : a hopeful but anxious one at home , and an uncertain but hopeful one overseas , the @entity21 's @entity53 said			0
speaking of the economic problems on a scale not seen since the @entity98 , @entity95 's @entity94 said : " like @entity99 and @entity100 , @entity5 , the new president , will get a rare opportunity to leave a sweeping and long - lasting imprint on the @entity7 economy			1
" the @entity53 called on @entity5 to continue the so - called " war on terror " by pursuing @entity105 - based militant groups , such as @entity106 which @entity107 blames for last year 's terror attacks in @entity109			2
" for the sake of the world 's security , @entity5 must press @entity114 to clamp down on these groups and close down their bases , something that the @entity119 administration failed to do for most of its run			2
" meanwhile , @entity122 's @entity121 sounded a note of caution about the weight of expectation now resting on @entity5 's shoulders : " the catchword of the election campaign was ' change			1
' the new message to his followers is : ' be patient			0
' " and there was little lament for the passing of the presidency of @entity5 's controversial predecessor , president @entity119			1
" he entered the @entity139 promising to heal division by being a ' uniter , not a divider			0
' he leaves it today as one of the most divisive and least popular presidents in @entity7 history , " the @entity143 said			0
for @entity5 , according to the @entity21 's @entity149 , the challenge in office will be to strike a balance between the " poetry " of his campaign for election and the tough " prose " of government			1
" beautiful rhetoric alone can not change the world			0
so perhaps the most encouraging aspect of the address was the new president 's willingness to spell out the scale of the problems facing @entity7 and the " hard choices " that lie ahead for him and the country , " the paper said			1
" an old @entity49 aphorism has it that politicians campaign in poetry , but govern in prose			2
we can be sure that the poetry will continue to flow from an orator as gifted as president @entity5			1
but now begins the difficult task of getting the prose right too			0
