-- calling for an airport screening process that maximizes security but cuts down on passenger hassles , the @entity1 on wednesday recommended key changes to the current system			1
the group , along with a panel of experts , suggested creating a trusted traveler program that would allow fliers who volunteer certain information about themselves to go through less rigorous security before their flight			1
it also proposed allowing each traveler to check one bag without a fee to reduce the amount of luggage going through security checkpoints			1
" we need to do better , " said @entity24 , a former ranking @entity25 member of the @entity27 and co-chairman of the panel , during a news conference in @entity31			0
" we owe it to the traveling public to make the system make more sense			2
" traveler frustration with the current routine -- which includes the familiar rules about taking off shoes , going through a metal detector or full - body scan ( or both ) and facing the possibility of a pat down -- prompted the report , titled " a better way , " the @entity1 said			1
what are the chances @entity50 would approve any portion of the plan ? it 's very difficult to get action in this area , @entity24 admitted			0
but if implemented , the recommendations could shorten wait times at security checkpoints and allow the @entity60 to screen passengers based on risk , the report said			1
' shrink the haystack ' right now , " everyone who checks in is treated as a potential terrorist , " said @entity64 , the former secretary of the @entity66 @entity65 and co-chairman of the panel			2
the group called it a " one - size - fits - all solution " in which children and the elderly can be pulled aside for extra screening			0
but having everyone go through the system is n't the way to eliminate risk , @entity64 said			0
" if you want to find a needle in a haystack , you shrink the haystack , " he said			0
that 's where the trusted traveler program would come in , designating some passengers as low - risk based on information such as a background check , employment history , lack of criminal record and other factors			1
once travelers enroll in the program and their identity is confirmed at the airport with the help of biometric information , they would be subject to less security , @entity64 said			2
the program should be extended to qualified international passengers , the panel recommends			0
the @entity60 screens more than 628 million airline passengers every year at @entity66 airports , and the vast majority present little to no risk of committing an act of terrorism , @entity60 administrator @entity109 said in a speech earlier this month			1
in response to wednesday 's report , @entity60 spokesman @entity115 said @entity109 's vision for the future of airport security screening is " one that is more risk - based and intelligence - driven , shifting away from a one - size - fits - all approach at checkpoints			1
" " last fall , [ @entity127 ] directed the agency to explore ways to further develop this strategy , with plans to announce more details this year			0
we welcome dialogue with stakeholders and the traveling public as the process moves forward , " he said			1
the bag problem meanwhile , the @entity1 report also sets its sights on baggage			2
passengers are bringing more carry - ons onto flights to avoid paying checked - bag fees , which increases checkpoint congestion and requires the @entity60 to devote more resources to screen passenger bags , the report says			1
the solution ? the @entity152 should require airlines to allow each passenger to check one bag as part of the base airfare , the panel recommends			2
@entity50 must improve the current system , said @entity160 , president and ceo of the @entity1			0
there are economic considerations at stake as well , he said			0
@entity165 cited a 2010 survey by @entity167 , which found that @entity66 travelers would take an additional two to three flights per year if the hassles in security screening system were eliminated			0
the additional flights would add nearly $ 85 billion in consumer spending and 900,000 jobs to the @entity66 economy , the report said .			0
