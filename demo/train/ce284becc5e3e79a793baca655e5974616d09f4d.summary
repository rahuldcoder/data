-- one of @entity2 's controversial " baby hatches " has been forced to shut down , at least temporarily			1
the facility in the southern city of @entity5 opened in january but has been overwhelmed with abandoned infants , forcing a suspension of services			1
the first of the facilities opened in 2011 and increased to around 25 hatches countrywide			1
more of the special rooms , which are equipped with a cradle , incubator and delayed alarm to allow mothers to drop off unwanted babies anonymously , are planned			2
while abandoning infants in @entity2 is illegal , the practice is relatively widespread , especially in poorer areas			2
the @entity5 " baby safety island , " as they are known in @entity2 , has received 262 babies since it began operation in late january , according to @entity2 state - run news agency @entity24			1
all 262 babies suffer from disabilities or diseases such as cerebral palsy , @entity32 's syndrome and congenital heart disease according to @entity24			1
the scheme 's proponents argue that the hatches are key to saving the lives of children who would likely die if abandoned on the street			2
since its opening , the facility received an average of around five babies a day			1
the staggering number of infants who have been abandoned in the city has meant that the hatch 's operator has not been able to keep up with the volume			1
the city 's @entity52 has had to add spaces to take their facilities to 1,100 beds , but these are already full			0
@entity57 the center 's director told @entity24 that the @entity5 baby hatch had received a disproportionate number of infants			1
" the number of babies we have received is much higher than in other parts of the country over the same period , " he said			2
he added that it could be parents who are unable to cope with the heavy economic burden of trying to treat incurable diseases			0
" parents bring their ill babies to big cities in the hope of having them cured			0
but many just end up abandoning them , " he said he was not able to predict a date when normal service would resume , but rather said that the center would focus on the children already in their care			0
the unprecedented response to the facility 's opening is causing some to question the wisdom of the scheme			0
however , the government appears to be standing by the hatches			0
@entity91 , minister of civil affairs , told reporters in the background of the country 's annual meeting of parliament this month that they " do more good than harm			0
