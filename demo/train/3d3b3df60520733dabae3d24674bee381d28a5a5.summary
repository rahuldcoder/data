-- @entity1 was officially sworn in as @entity3 's new president thursday after comfortably winning the country 's first direct vote to decide its head of state earlier this month			1
the appointment could see the 60 - year - old former semi-professional football player remain at the top of @entity3 politics for at least another decade			2
@entity1 was elected as prime minister of turkey three times between 2003 and 2014 but the internal rules of his @entity15 ( @entity16 ) prevented him from running for the position again			1
while the presidential role is designed to be a ceremonial one -- akin to that held by the @entity20 in the @entity21 -- @entity1 has already indicated a desire to change the constitution that will see his remit extended			2
but how do businesses on the ground feel about @entity3 's future and @entity1 's continuing role in front line politics ? foreign direct investment surged tenfold from just $ 20 billion in 2001 to over $ 200 billion today while massive infrastructure projects like @entity33 's @entity32 were completed under @entity1 's watch			1
however , growth has slowed to just over 2 % in recent years and international ratings agencies such as @entity37 's and @entity38 have cautioned investors over political and social unrest within the country			1
@entity0 's @entity42 spoke with @entity43 , president of the @entity45 - @entity3 @entity44 , about the prospects for the emerging market economy , with its 80 million consumers			1
he started by asking whether he was concerned by @entity3 's slower rate of growth in recent years			1
@entity43 ( @entity51 ) : we have been growing quite rapidly in the last ten years			0
( but ) nowadays the economy is slowing down , you are right			0
we should be expecting to see a growth rate of 3 % to 3.5 % in the next few years			2
@entity42 ( @entity56 ) : this is a difficult time because of the unrest in @entity59 which could last a few years			2
you have the challenges to the south in @entity63 , and @entity64 is slowing down again			0
where do you get your export growth ? @entity51 : well the neighboring countries in the southern part of @entity3 , @entity59 and @entity63 were our main partners for export in the old days -- actually being the main gateway to the @entity74 markets			1
going through @entity63 , @entity3 was exporting to almost a dozen markets			2
you are right , it has stopped and now the @entity77 is going through recession			0
hopefully the @entity45 and the @entity77 is working on the @entity81 ( @entity80 ) project			0
@entity3 is a partner and is exporting to both the @entity77 and the @entity45			2
@entity56 : years ago though , mr @entity1 was touting great growth to the @entity74 and @entity84			1
@entity84 is still in play but the @entity74 is very chaotic			0
this is really going to undermine the prospects for the next few years , is n't it ? @entity51 : of course after the @entity90 , in northern @entity84 -- where @entity3 had so many contractors in @entity92 , in @entity93 and @entity94 -- this also did n't help the @entity3 economy			1
i hope in the near future all these conflicts will be resolved and again @entity3 contractors will again take their place in these countries			2
@entity56 : you 've had mr @entity1 in office as prime minister for almost a dozen years			1
he could be in power ( as president ) for another ten years			0
does this not concern you , that there 's a centralization of power under one personality and one individual ? @entity51 : not really , because if you look at it @entity3 has had its best time in terms of economics and social welfare in the last 12 years			1
since november 3 , 2002 , things have been really growing			0
( that 's ) a good track record of a dozen years , as you say , of managing the country and ( managing ) relations ( with the likes ) of @entity64 and the @entity45			1
i think mr @entity1 ( should be ) given a chance to see what happens in his presidency			0
@entity56 : it 's interesting to see the ratings agencies , particularly @entity38 and @entity37 's , are putting a question mark over domestic political challenges			1
do you think that 's fair ? @entity51 : i do n't think so			0
if you look at the @entity3 economy we have our own dynamics			0
if you look at production , it is increasing			0
unemployment is not so bad			0
we have an average age of 29 , it is a big consumer market			0
so ratings institutes , i do n't know why they are trying to reduce the ratings of @entity3 .			1
