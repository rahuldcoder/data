-- the head of the company at the center of a toxic spill in @entity6 has been arrested , accused of public endangerment and harming the environment , authorities said monday			1
earlier , executive @entity9 had been questioned by authorities			1
@entity6 's prime minister , @entity10 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity11 that he favored strong government intervention against @entity9 's aluminum company , @entity13 " i proposed appointing a state commissioner to exercise control over the company who should manage the company and its assets until the tasks stemming from the disaster have been fulfilled , " he said			1
" i ask the parliament to accept the proposal			2
the company should be put under state control and its assets under state closure			2
" much of the red sludge has been removed or diluted in the town of @entity28			1
residents watched monday as emergency workers and soldiers walked past in full biohazard suits			2
military trucks and cars used to decontaminate the area came through the streets , spraying away the dark red dust that accumulates			2
workers told @entity0 that they have been diluting the mud and removing it constantly			2
meanwhile , an eighth victim of the sludge has been found , said @entity43 , an official with @entity6 's emergency services department			1
" we have found a body near @entity47 that is likely to be the missing person , who would be the eighth victim , " she told @entity0			1
" the identification process is ongoing , but we think this is the person who 's been missing			1
" five @entity50 experts are due to arrive in @entity6 on monday to find out how badly toxic sludge has damaged the environment and advise on decontamination , the @entity50 said			1
and @entity6 authorities continue frantically building dikes in case the dam holding the sludge breaks further , the government said monday			1
a " large section " of the dam is still showing signs of ruptures , the government said in a statement , meaning there is a " continuing risk of a possible spill			1
" the area has been evacuated , and soldiers were on standby sunday , an official said			1
the cracked wall is expected to collapse , @entity43 told @entity0 on sunday			1
" we know that it will happen , " she said , although when is unknown			2
about 800 people have been evacuated from the village of @entity47 , leaving it essentially empty , she said			2
hundreds of soldiers were ready to rescue inhabitants of a nearby village if the wall collapses			2
a 50 - centimeter ( 19 - inch ) crack has developed in the wall of the aluminum plant reservoir			2
if the wall collapses , 500,000 cubic meters of toxic red sludge could spill out			1
that 's about half the amount that spilled last monday , inundating @entity47 and two other villages			0
in addition to the eight people known to have been killed , more than 100 were injured			0
@entity6 's state - owned @entity94 news agency quoted @entity95 , state secretary of environment , as saying the damaged wall could not be saved			1
specialists had tried to reinforce the wall saturday			0
@entity10 , the prime minister , who was visiting the stricken area saturday , said it was " very likely " the reservoir wall will collapse			1
" it 's in very bad shape , and our estimation is that that wall could fall down , " @entity10 told reporters in the town of @entity105			0
" one consequence is that human lives could be in danger			0
that 's the reason why we pulled out ... all human lives from that area , in order not to have more loss in human life			0
" the sludge from last monday 's spill reached @entity125 's mighty @entity124 river thursday , raising fears of wider contamination in @entity6 and countries downstream , including @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 and the @entity133			1
but water test results released friday indicated the sludge may not harm the @entity124 after all			1
the ph , or acidity , level of the @entity124 water was 8.5 friday -- slightly above normal but not dangerous and able to sustain life , @entity43 said			0
readings of @entity136 range from 0 to 14			0
levels lower than 7 characterize acids , and levels higher than 7 denote bases ; highly acidic or highly basic water can harm living things			0
the 8.5 ph level and fast - moving currents made officials optimistic that a natural disaster can be avoided , @entity43 said			1
however , on sunday she said that while saving lives is the priority , officials remain concerned about the long - term effects of the spill and want to protect @entity125 's waterways			0
but , she said , it 's too soon to tell what those effects might be			0
" what happened on monday has never happened before in @entity125 , so we will see , " she said , " and we will try to avoid a bigger new catastrophe			0
" the environmental disaster occurred near @entity105 , nearly 100 miles west of @entity164			1
the sludge covered the villages of @entity47 , @entity167 , and @entity168 , in some places reaching several feet high , leaving dead animals such as fish and frogs in its wake			1
the aluminum company , @entity13 , said in a statement saturday it was doing its utmost " to avoid further damages and to reinforce the injured deposit			0
" the company maintains it has performed extensive maintenance work and renovations in the past decade and had followed safety regulations			0
the company was working to construct dams and defense lines in an attempt to minimize damage , it said			0
it has also established a relief fund for victims of the spill and was attempting to help in finding accommodations for evacuated people			0
more than 1,100 residents of @entity105 and the surrounding towns are @entity13 employees , it said			0
@entity10 warned saturday of the " toughest possible consequences " for those responsible for the spill and said human error was the cause			0
" behind this tragedy , some human errors and mistakes must exist , " he said			0
" we will reveal all of that , and the consequences will be very serious -- as much as you can imagine			0
" the exact chemical composition of the sludge has not been revealed , but aluminum processing normally involves compounds that include cyanide , cadmium and chromium			1
emergency workers have been pouring plaster and fertilizers on the sludge in hopes that it will counter its alkalinity			2
dust from sludge that dries may also pose a threat , @entity6 's @entity222 has said			2
it said some workers involved in damage cleanup may need filtering masks			0
@entity0 's @entity230 , @entity231 , @entity232 , @entity233 and @entity234 , and journalist @entity235 contributed to this report .			0
