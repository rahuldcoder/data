-- we 've heard of musicians finding collaborators via @entity4 and reporters finding sources , but what about long - lost brothers finding each other ? well , that 's what happened to @entity12 , online news producer for @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16			1
" i have a routine of checking my e-mail , @entity4 and @entity21 before bed each night , just in case something happened during the evening that i did n't catch , " keys told us			1
well , at nearly midnight , keys saw a message that would lead to a pretty big piece of news that he did n't previously " catch " -- a message from a man named @entity34 reading : " hey is your mom 's name @entity37 ? " obviously , @entity12 was a bit freaked out			1
still , after seeing @entity34 's picture , which looked familiar , the young man recalled having spoken to his brother before			2
" @entity34 and i actually met in a web forum , " he explains			1
" neither of us can remember exactly how we came to meet , but we kept in touch off and on over the past year on @entity46 and @entity47			0
" determined to solve the mystery , @entity12 fired up @entity47 and messaged @entity34			1
" he started telling me things from my childhood that i had heard bits and pieces of growing up -- things nobody could have possibly known , " keys said			0
" i gave him my cell phone number and told him to call me			0
after a few minutes talking on the phone , it became pretty clear to both of us that he and i were related			0
we wound up speaking on the phone for four hours , so much so to the point that i had to take the next day off from work to sleep ! " how did @entity34 know that @entity49 was his bro ? well , a few years ago , his mother told him that his father had other children , and mentioned a few names , including @entity49 's			2
" at some point , @entity34 started asking his mom and our dad about me and something in him pushed him to ask me on @entity4 details about my biological mom , " @entity12 says			1
after reconnecting , the two then went @entity75 for an interview , and @entity12 was even able to give @entity34 a ride to the station , because -- get this -- they live 10 minutes away from each other			1
according to @entity34 , the boys have even more siblings out there , waiting to be found			0
here 's hoping they all have @entity4 handles			2
as an online news producer , @entity12 knows only too well the power of social media			1
" after telling our story on @entity21 , we were flooded with people e-mailing and posting to our wall about similar lost and found stories involving biological and adopted siblings and relatives , " he says			0
" it was extremely touching			0
i use @entity4 for much of the same reason			0
@entity4 and @entity21 are both extremely powerful tools to reach out to our television audience and to interact and respond to the praise , concerns and personal stories of those who watch our on - air product			2
" it 's apparently also giving the old - fashioned @entity108 a run for his money			0

two long - lost brothers , who reconnected on @entity4 , previously met in a web forum
keys received a message from @entity34 reading : " hey is your mom 's name @entity37 ? "
as an online news producer , @entity12 knows the power of social media
