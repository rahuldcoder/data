-- i love helping others plan a trip to @entity4			1
not only does it give me a sense of home - turf pride , it 's a beautiful country to visit that 's great at looking after tourists			1
first , let 's get a common misconception out of the way : yes , there is a significant crime rate in some parts of the country , and you will need to be vigilant			1
but , the same can be said for almost any country worldwide			1
on to the good stuff			2
@entity4 is a beautifully diverse country , racially and geographically			1
that being said , it 's important to have a travel plan before you go			1
my ideal @entity4 vacation would include a lengthy stop in @entity27 ( my home town ) , a drive up the @entity29 and a safari			1
that way you get a bit of all the country has to offer			1
the mother city the @entity37 is characterized by a steep mountain range running down into the cool blue @entity39			2
the most famous mountain in this range is called @entity42 because it 's flat like a table			2
to its left is @entity47 and to its right is @entity50			2
the view from the summit of @entity42 is top of my list when visiting the @entity27			1
you can get up and down by hiking or taking the cable car			2
lines are long , so if you 're going during the day , get there early			2
i highly recommend taking a picnic up to the top an hour or so before sunset and taking the last car down			2
@entity27 is known for its red and orange skies at sundown , and @entity42 provides the perfect panoramic view			1
my best advice for people visiting @entity27 would be to group outings together by location			1
@entity71 is a bit of a drive away , but i find it well worth it to see where the cold @entity39 meets the warm @entity74			2
just be mindful of the baboons -- they 're cheeky ! it 's easy to stop in @entity78 , @entity79 or even @entity80 for lunch or a snack on the way back			1
the @entity84 and the @entity85 are two local eateries that have stunning views			2
a visit to @entity88 is also likely to take a whole day			2
book a ferry ticket in advance and be sure to check the weather report			0
visiting this island , which was used as a prison for centuries , is very humbling and should n't be missed			0
@entity96 was imprisoned on @entity88 for 18 years			0
another interesting day trip is an outing to the wine farms			0
see whether your hotel can organize a driver for you			0
i love @entity104 , which has a great restaurant and affordable wines			0
they also have a goat pen to entertain children , and of course , delicious goat cheese available for tasting with your wine			0
some other well - known vineyards include @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120			0
i also like visiting the small university town of @entity122			0
its quaint , tree - lined streets provide some shelter from the heat , and it 's a great place to stop for coffee or a meal on your way back to the city			1
can you tell @entity4 like to eat ? back in the city , it 's really worth it to check out some local flavors			1
@entity136 is in the middle of the central business district and is a great place to find some authentic carvings and crafts			0
there are plenty of great places to eat there , too			0
try @entity146 or @entity147 © if you 're looking for strictly @entity4 food			1
@entity150 usually starts buzzing as the sun goes down			0
running the length of downtown @entity27 , @entity150 is home to backpacker lodges , hip clothing boutiques , funky restaurants and amazing night life			1
exploring outside the city once you 've had your fill of the @entity27 area , take a drive up the @entity29			1
this stretch of highway runs up @entity4 's eastern coast and is well - known for its breathtaking views and whale - watching vantages			1
completing the trek in three or four days gives you ample time to stop as you want along the way			2
for overnight destinations , i recommend @entity176 ( to say you 've been to the southernmost tip of @entity4 ) , @entity171 ( great for whale watching if you 're there in the spring ) and @entity170			1
there are beautiful beaches along this stretch of coastline , as well as lush rainforests and winding mountain passes			0
for the more adventurous , bungee jumping off the @entity186 is a must -- it 's the tallest bridge jump in the world ! as for the safari portion , @entity189 boasts all the big five ( elephant , rhino , lion , leopard , buffalo ) and is conveniently at the end of the @entity29			1
alternatively , you could visit @entity197			0
arguably the country 's most well - known game reserve , @entity198 offers multiple accommodation options ( ranging from camping to a fabulous lodge ) and is well - prepared for tourists			1
if you 'd prefer to do something a little more intimate , @entity204 , @entity205 and @entity206 are beautiful			0
the best way to see game is on drives			0
most parks offer drives early morning or at sunset			0
dress warmly if you 're going in the morning and take bug spray if you 're going at night			0
another way to observe the wildlife is at a watering hole			0
most parks have huts or viewing areas around big holes where you can watch animals undisturbed			0
@entity4 are a very friendly and helpful bunch			1
we love helping people , especially tourists , and if you enjoy something along the way , we 'll likely ask you to tell your friends back home			0
take your time while traveling			0
we tend to move pretty slowly , but it means we enjoy every moment and i hope you 'll do the same .			0
