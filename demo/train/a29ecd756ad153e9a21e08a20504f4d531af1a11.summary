challenges continue to mount for health secretary @entity1			1
public criticism persists as she prepares to testify on wednesday before a congressional committee heatedly demanding answers about ongoing problems with the @entity9 administration 's health care enrollment website			1
public ridicule reached prime - time -- or late - night -- when @entity12 parodied @entity1 and the @entity14 debacle that has rocked the online rollout of president @entity9 's signature domestic policy achievement			1
sen. @entity17 , @entity18 , called her a " laughingstock " on @entity23 's " @entity22 " and said " she 's lost considerable credibility			2
" and then another @entity25 federal website outage occurred over the weekend			1
it resulted from efforts to fix a technical problem			2
but @entity1 appears secure for now , despite political uproar , a public relations debacle and a " punch list " of tangible problems that have hampered the @entity25 website			1
that 's because @entity9 has her back			1
the president has resisted calls from @entity38 opponents to show sebalius the door			2
he has " full confidence " in @entity1 , @entity41 spokesman @entity40 said this month			1
that 's all @entity1 needs at the moment , and she knows it , especially with her appearance before the @entity47 looming			1
@entity1 told @entity48 last week that " the majority of people calling for me to resign , i would say , are people who i do n't work for and who do not want this program to work in the first place			1
" for the time being , @entity9 has few choices other than to stick with the woman responsible for implementing the initiative to get millions of uninsured @entity60 health insurance			1
dr. @entity61 : 5 surprises from @entity1 interview @entity64 while @entity1 is constantly being hammered for the faulty rollout , the president escapes a good deal of the blame			1
@entity1 even protected the president by saying in the interview with @entity48 that he did n't know about potential problems with the website until a couple of days after its launch on october 1			1
@entity75 , crisis management expert and ceo of @entity75 , said the president is getting a free ride			2
" she is going to absorb a tremendous amount of lightning , " he said , adding that is part of the plan			0
" the general rules is the president announces good news and the departments announce bad news and get the blame , " said @entity75 , who worked in president @entity86 's administration			2
rep. @entity93 of @entity94 has aggressively investigated the @entity9 administration as chairman of the @entity38 - led @entity97			2
and he is putting the blame over snafus with the @entity25 online rollout squarely at the feet of @entity1			1
" the president has been poorly served in the implementation of his own signature legislation , " @entity93 said on @entity103 ' " @entity102			0
" confirmation concessions one reason @entity1 is likely to keep her job for now is that a permanent replacement requires @entity112 confirmation , finding someone else ostensibly to serve out his term would subject @entity9 to a damaging political fight with conservative @entity38 determined to get rid of the health care law			1
the hidden truth behind early @entity25 numbers : it 's not what it seems moreover , @entity48 senior political analyst @entity121 said an @entity9 ally would not ultimately be confirmed , regardless of who was appointed			1
there would be " virtual certainty " of a @entity38 filibuster as " an opportunity to use this as kind of a way to leverage more concessions from the administration , " @entity121 , editorial director of @entity124 , said monday on @entity48 's " @entity134			0
" additionally , a confirmation hearing and debate in the @entity112 over a nominee would create another opportunity for @entity38 to re-litigate @entity25			1
it 's a commonly used tactic in @entity140			0
republicans held up two nominees to head the new @entity143 because they opposed the new agency designed to protect consumers and did n't want to see it running because they felt it put unfair burdens on business			0
the president could avoid a confirmation fight by appointing an interim replacement , but there are political and practical risks with that as well			2
firing her wo n't fix it in fact , it could make the situation worse			1
bringing in someone on a temporary basis to oversee the largest implementation of a government program since @entity164 in 1965 could confuse the process			0
dr. @entity166 , former administrator for the @entity167 , oversaw the bumpy roll out of the @entity164 's expansive @entity170 program			0
he said firing her " by itself would n't do anything			0
" @entity1 is the public face of @entity25			1
@entity166 said she needs to " make sure there 's an effective strategy to address the problem " as well answer questions for the public and @entity180			2
@entity9 has brought in additional help , including @entity182 , who is a noted management consultant , former @entity41 budget official and the forthcoming director of the @entity185			2
the appointment has been praised by some of the most critical @entity38			0
" he 's got a lot of managerial experience			0
he 's been a consultant for the health care industry			0
i think he 's got the right qualifications , " rep. @entity191 , @entity192 , said sunday on @entity48 's " @entity193			0
" @entity1 ' @entity25 damage control fuels critics ' fire @entity25 has n't failed yet while the online rollout has been a disaster , the actual program has n't failed			1
people have until march 31 to sign up to obtain health coverage for 2014			0
" if people become more comfortable with the program , the outrage will recede , " @entity75 said			0
" it 's going to take a while to get people acclimated to managing their health care this way			0
i think there 's going to be a lot of bed side manner , hand holding , and direction giving and that 's going to take a while , " he added			0
@entity75 cautioned , however , the scenario could change quickly and the administration should be assessing the situation constantly			0
for instance , the program needs to enroll millions of the young and the healthy to keep costs down and enable the program to work			0
" this is day by day , " he said			0
" if the problems continue and they may , he may have to change his tone			0

despite the tangible problems and the public relations *nightmare* , @entity1 appears secure in her job
@entity1 is president @entity9 's *scapegoat* for @entity25 website disaster
confirmation hearings to replace her would be damaging politically for the president
replacing @entity1 wo n't necessarily fix the problems either
