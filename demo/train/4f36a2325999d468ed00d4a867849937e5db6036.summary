-- @entity2 " @entity1 is no stranger to making bold statements			1
in front of thousands of concert - goers at april 's @entity7 , the 21 - year - old rap artist announced that he would name one of his future albums " i 'm @entity10			1
" so , what 's the big deal ? well , for starters , @entity1 is not gay			1
and although it 'd be easy to write him off as another performer trying to stir up controversy and gain popularity , he 's already got the latter covered			1
like @entity19 and @entity20 , @entity1 has almost single - handedly used the internet to put himself into the spotlight			1
in a few short years as a solo artist without a major - label deal , @entity1 has recorded almost 4,000 songs , gained over 200,000 @entity28 followers and signed a touring deal with @entity30			1
his @entity32 videos have been viewed 28.7 million times and counting			0
@entity1 's supporters and fans laud him for his gender - defying self - proclamations that he 's " pretty b --- - " and a " princess " while producing songs inspired by untraditional hip - hop topics like @entity41 and @entity42			1
at the same time , a growing skepticism follows the artist , who some critics argue is full of himself and is more concerned with selling an image through hyperbolic claims than any music of substance			0
@entity1 says he saw the @entity51 moment as a chance to bridge the differences between communities and spread his message of " loving			1
" " i think that ( announcement ) was so much bigger than he was , " said @entity56 , a former @entity57 executive and the openly gay author of the book " hiding in @entity60			0
" " that it was like seeing his future before it even actually happened			0
" while advocates in the lgbt community like @entity56 feel that @entity1 is sincere , others like @entity68 , a @entity69 blogger of the year who is openly gay , are n't so sure			1
" i do n't want to take anything away from what i think he 's trying to do , " @entity71 said of the album , which is set for release in a few months , according to @entity74 " i really do feel that it is less about social evolution , and it 's more about making a name for yourself and selling your project			1
" @entity1 sat down with @entity0 to talk about the inspiration for the title , the death threats that have followed and why he 's the rap version of @entity88			1
the following is a transcript of that interview			0
@entity0 : what were you thinking when you named the album " i 'm gay ? " @entity1 : it was something that was going through my mind for a while			1
i feel like i 'm man of the people : meeting people , respecting people and accepting people			1
i hope that i can turn some of my fans that might be homophobic or supporters that might be homophobic and say , " you know what , we 're all one people			0
" it 's just respect , and i did that to bring people together and bring more love and to spark the minds of people and not let words and judgments and stereotypes stop you from loving			0
@entity0 : i read that you 've gotten some death threats			1
@entity1 : mainly , a lot of them are on @entity28 , saying that they 're going to kill me for being gay , and they 're going to kill me for being homosexual even though i 'm not homosexual			1
i do n't like men			1
they 're saying they 're going to bash my head in			0
they 're calling me f --- --			0
that 's all right , because i did this with the pure intention in my heart to help people , and i did n't do this for promotional reasons			2
i did because there needs to be someone brave enough to do it , brave enough to speak up and have the right reasonings of doing it			0
@entity0 : what 's your response to people who say this is all a gimmick ? @entity1 : i 'm not here just doing stuff just trying to do it or outsmart somebody and try to do something witty			1
i call myself the human sacrifice , because i look at it like , no one else is going to do it and push that line for the people , and i 'm going to do it , and they 're going to look at me and say , " well , you know what ? if that guy can do it , i can be myself too , and if that rapper can be himself and be free and be happy and still hold masculinity and love people and love flowers and just be happy being alive , well then , i can do that too			2
" @entity0 : you 're big @entity28 fan , and recently rapper @entity172 tweeted that after he spoke to @entity175 artist @entity174 and listened to your music , his response was , " @entity177 needed a dad in his life			0
" @entity1 : i 'm going to say , who is @entity172 ? so he needs to work on promoting and marketing himself , because i do n't know him			1
but what i feel about his comment is that it 's true , i needed a father figure in my life , but i 'm not complaining about that			2
what do you mean , i need that ? tell rhymefest i 'm very happy			2
tell @entity172 i actually wake up and i 'm happy , and i 'm positive and i love people			2
ask @entity172 , does he feel the same way ? @entity0 : how influential are your parents in your career , and what do they think about your music ? @entity1 : i can say they 're not very influential in my career , but i 'm motivated ; i work hard to show my mother that her child has a purpose			1
my father has played a part unconsciously when i was younger , which he probably did n't know ,			2
but he was giving me a lot of good music , ( and ) my mother played a lot of good music			0
so i will always forever show respect to both of them on that			0
they might not be listening to my music all the time because there 's stuff that they do n't agree with			2
i do n't expect them to agree with my language and stuff like that			2
@entity0 : you 've called yourself rap 's @entity88			0
care to elaborate ? @entity1 : it 's just because i 'm fearless			1
i have a huge support base of people that love me around the world : millions of fans and supporters and growing			0
you know what , it 's just me putting what i want to put out and me just being an artist , a true artist to myself			0
i go to sleep happy			0
i wake up excited because i give the truth			0
@entity0 : on @entity28 , you threatened to sexually assault @entity237 if he did n't respond to your tweets			2
why threaten @entity237 with sexual violence ? @entity1 : you know , really , it 's just my jokes			1
i have a funny sense of humor			0
if i was a comedian and i was up on stage , people would think that 's funny , because i 'm a funny comedian			2
throughout the years i feel if @entity249 promotes me to stay alive and have more years to live on @entity250 , which i pray and i would love to , people are going to see my personality , and they 're going to see more of me and be able to understand me more			0
@entity0 : do you think of a lot of the hate / confusion is a generational thing ? @entity1 : there 's a disconnect because they want a disconnect			1
when you want to read the book , come read the book			0
when you want to come talk to me and be my friend , come talk to me			0
they want to seclude themselves			0
the generation gap , they do n't want to understand			2
@entity0 : what 's your response to folks who say you 've pushed the progression of hip - hop back a few steps ? @entity1 : they 're just not paying attention fully , and i forgive them			1
not everybody has time to pay attention fully , or not everybody has the time to read a book			0
some people refuse to read books , and i 'm just an unread book			2

album title has brought debate , death threats
