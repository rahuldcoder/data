-- i 'm crossing the @entity3 desert of northern @entity4 on foot -- a few hundred kilometers -- clutching my " bear banger			1
" this device looks like a pen and fits in my pocket			2
triggered , it will explode with a loud bang , scaring animals without harming them			2
i 'm with my guide , @entity16 , on the trail of the elusive black rhino in one of the few truly wild places left in the world			1
" the worst thing we could do is to run away from an animal -- we 'll be finished , " @entity16 warns me			2
tragedy of the rhino driven to the brink of extinction , the black rhino 's story is one of the most tragic wildlife crimes			1
due to poaching , 92 % of the population has been wiped out over the past 30 years , and there are now just 5,055 left in the world			1
these numbers are an improvement , however , from the lowest point of 2,500 in the 1980s and are thanks to conservation efforts and , perhaps surprisingly , tourism			1
firstly , in the early 1980s , save the @entity42 ( @entity43 ) was formed to offer poachers a more secure livelihood as wildlife rangers			1
in 2003 , @entity43 partnered with @entity47 , an eco-tourism operator			1
their common vision was to view the rhino discreetly			1
by accommodating tourists willing to pay money to track rhinos on foot , they provided employment for locals and income for monitoring and research			1
after 30 years of work and 10 years of responsible tourism , rhino numbers increased fivefold			1
desert tracking @entity3 is now home to the largest concentration of black rhino on @entity68			1
the green crowns of ana trees dot the brown palette of the landscape , carrying thick , curled reddish brown fruits that desert elephants love			2
hours - old footprints of a bull elephant give us our first tracking opportunity			2
we eventually catch up to him as he 's eating from the thorny branches of an ana tree			2
waves of emotions rush through me as we stop and stand still			2
he knows we 're here			2
" he 's not bothered by us , " @entity16 whispers to me			0
" it 's a respectful sighting , the type that i really enjoy			0
" the next day at 6 a.m. the rangers and i leave @entity91			0
after an hour 's drive we see fresh rhino tracks on a riverbed and follow on foot			1
tracking soon becomes difficult , as there are no footsteps anymore , just rocks that have been moved			0
finding them is an exercise in mindfulness			0
tracking epitomizes abilities that humans have almost completely lost : to read the landscape and be aware of its smallest details			0
as they walk , the rangers wave their hands as if in an ancient dance : open hands , palm forward , indicating each track or to inform others of a new direction			1
nobody talks , just a gentle whistle to attract attention			0
then we find fresh dung			0
one of the rangers , @entity121 , squats to check its temperature			0
feeling close , we increase our pace and come to view a riverbed			0
the rhino is there , grazing			1
he raises his head toward us ; he knows something 's up			0
keeping ourselves at a distance , we sit in silence and enjoy the tranquil landscape			0
@entity121 writes down the gps position in his logbook			0
tracking is an effective way to understand animal behavior			0
the importance of pride rangers in @entity3 are proud of their job and the community looks up at people like @entity121			0
" poaching is essentially not an issue anymore in @entity4 because conservation efforts put local communities at the center , " says @entity147 , a scientific advisor at @entity43			1
" it 's become socially unacceptable ; poachers are viewed as stealing from the community			0
" he says in @entity158 it 's the opposite : poachers crossing the border to kill animals in @entity162 are considered @entity163 , risking their lives to bring back to the community the little money paid by international syndicates trading in illegal ivory			0
how to keep it going while examples like @entity173 in @entity4 and tourism ventures such as the @entity175 are the success stories of conservation , their effectiveness is being threatened again by a recent surge in poaching			1
fueled by a growing demand for rhino horn in @entity183 , 1,004 rhino were killed in 2013 , up from 668 killed in 2012 and just 13 killed in 2007			1
in response to these alarming figures , 46 countries agreed in @entity187 earlier this year on a declaration to tackle wildlife crimes			0
the hope is that this is the turning point for the fight against poaching .			2

poaching has wiped out 92 % of black rhino population in the last 30 years
conservation agencies have partnered with eco-tourism operators
tourists can track rhino on foot with professional guides
@entity42 numbers have increased but are under threat again from recent surge in poaching
