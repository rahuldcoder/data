@entity0 -- a stiff upper lip			2
the stereotypes about the @entity7 have been around since our ships first set sail to collect an empire			1
certainly the idea of showing public emotion is a very un-british thing to do			1
we keep our feelings to ourselves ... or at least we did			0
walking around @entity0 this weekend one is tempted to believe you 've arrived in another country			0
large men standing outside pubs singing " @entity20			1
" okay , they were a bit drunk			0
roads cordoned off so the bunting can be draped in time for street parties ... my local hardware shop has set up a stall selling @entity29 paper plates , napkins and just about everywhere , flags , flags and more flags			2
i am well used to seeing a fiesta of stars and stripes in the @entity37 , but to see so many @entity38 fluttering on buildings from the grand museums to the corner shop in @entity0 is a very unusual sight			0
so this is no usual time as the nation rallies behind the queen as she celebrates her diamond jubilee			1
i am old enough to remember three jubilee celebrations			2
the first , was her majesty 's silver jubilee in 1977			2
i still have the souvenir mirror i bought on a school trip to @entity0			0
it cost me Â £ 2 -- funny how we remember the little facts			0
i do n't remember much else about it except we had time off school ! and 25 years later for the golden jubilee , i was front and center covering the event outside @entity61 for @entity1			1
i have no shame in saying tears were in my eyes when the crowds massed around the @entity66 outside @entity61 singing the national anthem			0
the royals arrived on the balcony and @entity70 took part in the flypast			0
@entity70 has gone the way of the @entity74 and the @entity75 but the queen remains on the throne and , if the latest polls are to be believed , commands up to 80 % support from the @entity7 people			1
it is not hard to see why			0
in a social media era where we count contributions in 140 characters and have @entity87 friends by the hundreds and frankly , none of it much matters , the queen stands for something much , more			2
while these concepts might sound old - fashioned in a here - today - gone - tomorrow world they are the backbone for what monarchy represents			0
in her coronation broadcast in 1953 the queen pledged herself to a life of service , saying " throughout all my life and with all my heart i shall strive to be worthy of your trust			2
" it was a vow she repeated earlier this year before parliament , saying she would " rededicate myself to the service of our great country and its people now and in the years to come			2
" how many of us rededicate ourselves to anything , let alone a promise we made six decades ago ? the @entity7 people may not go gaga very often but when we do , we do it full throttle			1
after the death of @entity124 in 1997 all national reserve was lost as we went into emotional collapse			0
and again , after the @entity128 's death in 2002 , hundreds of thousands of people lined up to pay their respects : the authorities had feared no one would show up ! while the royal wedding last year showed we like the glamour that a new star joining the royal team brings			1
ultimately , for real deep - seated , honestly felt emotion , that goes to the @entity7 core , it is usually left to the very top senior royal , the queen			1
this weekend , those people who call @entity141 their queen are saying " thank you			1
" so , in my coverage on sunday and on tuesday i will be taking all this on board as i bring you the majesty of the day , the fun of the moments and the celebration of the times			0
i know most of you are not subjects of the crown and so i ask you the indulgence of remembering i am @entity7 and this is the celebration of 60 years of my head of state			1
i promise my coverage will be fair , but it wo n't be neutral			0
listen carefully when she goes past and you may just hear me joining in as the crowd sing " @entity20			1

the idea of showing public emotion is a very un-british thing to do , says @entity166
but this is no usual time as nation rallies behind queen as she celebrates her diamond jubilee .
@entity7 people may not go gaga very often but when we do , we do it full throttle , he says
quest : you may just hear me joining in as the crowd sing " @entity20 "
