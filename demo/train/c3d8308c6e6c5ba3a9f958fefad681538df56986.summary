-- the @entity1 , the " world 's greatest deliberative body , " with a reputation for gridlock that surpasses even that of my native @entity6 , on thursday passed an immigration reform bill by a bipartisan majority			1
as the fight moves to the @entity12 , it 's a good time to reflect on just what this bill will mean for @entity15 and to redouble our efforts to pass it			1
the last major immigration reform bill was in 1986 under president @entity20			1
i was 3 , my parents had just bought their first computer and the @entity24 was a dream			0
many of today 's great tech companies were not yet on the radar screen			0
our country has changed a lot during those 27 years , but not -- so far -- our immigration policy			0
suffice it to say , if we can pass our generation 's immigration reform , it will be a really big deal			1
@entity15 's greatest asset has always been its people , drawn here from all over the world			1
in the 21st century , our economic future depends on immigrants more than ever			0
the fastest - growing sector of our economy is the knowledge economy , where the main competitive difference is people			1
how immigration reform would affect 3 families in a globalized world where people and businesses have their choice of countries to locate in , continuing to have the best trained , hardest - working and most productive people in the world will keep the @entity15 at the forefront of global competitiveness			1
we have some huge advantages : the top universities in the world , the top scientific researchers , and -- right alongside these -- our identity as a nation of immigrants and descendants of immigrants			2
at @entity67 , a nonprofit advocacy group , we are entrepreneurs , and we believe that one of the main reasons @entity15 is the leading entrepreneurial nation is that we are a nation of immigrants			1
leaving behind your home country and everything you know to create a better life for your family is the essence of the risk - taking that characterizes the entrepreneurial ethos			1
i think back to my ancestors in the shtetls of @entity84 in the 19th century			0
they had probably never been more than two miles from their village , and got on a steamship to go to a country they had never even seen in a picture , knowing they would never return home			0
that is truly putting it all on the line to make a better life			0
it is not random , who chooses to emigrate , and the work ethic and entrepreneurial spirit of these immigrants have shaped the character of our country			2
entrepreneurs in @entity106 do not just identify with the experience of computer programmers coming to @entity15 to work at tech companies , but with everyone who comes here to make a better life			2
it 's why we are working for comprehensive immigration reform			1
there are talented young people in @entity15 who were brought here by their parents who now can not go to college or work because they are undocumented			2
these @entity121 are just waiting to contribute , and their parents , with the right accountability measures , should be able to join them by coming out of the shadows and contributing fully to their communities			0
opinion : on immigration , @entity127 offers fear , not ideas in addition , we know that the best and the brightest come here to study , start companies and create jobs that grow our economy ; millions more are caught in limbo navigating a complex and broken system that is totally outdated for a modern economy and modern @entity15 families			1
we need to pass comprehensive immigration reform to unlock those contributions and by doing so change millions of lives			1
@entity67 has been visiting college graduations , talking with some of the smart young international graduates who have the potential to expand @entity15 businesses and create new innovations here			2
many are returning home despite job offers in the @entity15 , for one reason -- they ca n't get visas			2
a loss for them and a loss for us -- collateral damage of an outdated immigration policy			0
over our history , the @entity15 has often been good at welcoming immigrants			2
in fact , it 's part of what defines @entity15			2
@entity20 said it well , recounting the sentiments in a letter he received from a man before he left office : " you can go live in @entity168 , but you can not become a @entity168			0
you can go to live in @entity169 or @entity170 , but you ca n't become a @entity169 , an @entity170			0
he went through @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 and other countries			0
but he said anyone , from any corner of the world , can come to live in the @entity15 and become an @entity15			0
" @entity180 immigration reform is a big deal , but it is not a done deal			1
we are at a hinge moment for @entity15			0
do n't hold back -- the time is here to be heard as the fight continues to pass meaningful comprehensive immigration reform			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .			0
