@entity0 -- @entity2 had to know she was going to have to talk about her wealth			1
the tightly orchestrated book tour for her new memoir has closely resembled a campaign -- with war rooms and surrogate coordination			0
so one would expect that @entity9 was prepared to answer questions on any topic			1
but when the wealth question came , @entity9 , the political heavy hitter , whiffed			1
the muffed answers have made trouble on their own for the potential presidential candidate by raising new questions about her ability to connect with average voters on economic issues			2
but they 've also had another consequence			0
prior to her book tour , she 'd begun a pivot to the left			2
many liberals had questioned her economic themes and coziness with @entity31			1
in response , she stepped up her populist rhetoric			1
however , because of the blaring headlines on wealth , her outreach to party progressives has gone mostly unnoticed so far , possibly clouding her appeal to another important constituent			2
a day to forget @entity9 's first misstep came when she told @entity42 at the start of her book tour this month that she and her family " came out of the @entity44 not only dead broke but in debt , " adding later that her family had " no money " at that time			1
she was n't wrong when she said the first family left the @entity44 way behind financially			2
she said they were burdened by legal bills and still had to keep a roof -- actually two -- over their heads and send their daughter to college			0
but here 's a mighty big difference between @entity9 and the average person			1
for starters , she and her husband were obviously well positioned to quickly capitalize on the post-presidential custom of cashing in			0
she left that part out			2
@entity2 had a massive book advance in the works and , along with the former president , the prospect of making millions			2
this is what fueled cries of hypocrisy			0
after quickly trying to clean up the comments , though , @entity9 swung and missed again on sunday when questioned about her own financial standing and wealth inequality in an interview with @entity77			1
@entity9 compared herself to others and noted her situation is different , too			2
" we pay ordinary income tax , unlike a lot of people who are truly well off , not to name names ; and we 've done it through dint of hard work , " she said			0
one reason @entity9 's two missteps on wealth are surprising is that questions about the issue are not new and should n't have come as a surprise			1
@entity95 websites like @entity96 began asking questions about her speaking fees -- upwards of $ 200,000 -- in early may			2
@entity102 groups like the @entity103 and @entity104 , an outside @entity105 super pac , had been probing the topic longer			0
@entity108 , a progressive activist and @entity9 critic , said she handled the wealth question poorly and " certainly has enough money to hire a better speaking coach			1
" but she downplayed the mistake			0
" why people do have a problem with her is not because of her personal wealth , it is because of her coziness with @entity31			1
that is the problem , " @entity108 said			0
the monied elite is an anathema to liberals , who decry wealth inequality , the corrosive impact of too - big - to - fail businesses and , of course , the overwhelming power in @entity129 of the professional investor class vs. average people struggling to save			1
for much of @entity9 's time on the paid speaking circuit , the former secretary of state has focused on bipartisan issues and kept some distance with hot political issues			1
but less than a month before questions about her wealth and understanding of the middle class started to define her book tour , @entity9 departed from more bipartisan topics and stepped up her populist rhetoric in a may speech at the @entity147			1
she bashed @entity149 , embraced material from the liberal playbook , and highlighted populist themes in her speeches			2
@entity9 charged up her rhetoric , too			1
she blasted tight - fisted millionaires , decried the current economy as a " throwback to the @entity158 , " and dusted off old standbys about @entity102 trickle - down economics			0
the change in tone has n't happened in a vacuum , and may have projected that @entity9 and her aides expected criticism about her wealth , stature and ability to relate to everyday @entity129			1
but because of the mistakes , her populist pivot has largely gone unnoticed			0
an exclusive club instead , it 's @entity9 's two tone - deaf statements about her family 's wealth that have defined her book tour , so far			1
they have also begun to shine a light on @entity9 's work as a constant fundraiser			1
between her campaign for president in 2008 and her time as the head of a global foundation , she spent a considerable amount of time courting the money of millionaires and billionaires			0
her foundation -- the @entity193 -- has also become a bastion for corporate donors			0
@entity196 , the founder of @entity198 business group ; @entity199 , the founder of @entity200 and @entity201 and @entity202 , @entity204 megadonors and the owners of @entity206 , have donated between $ 10 million and $ 25 million			0
@entity102 have seized on it and are looking to portray @entity9 as out - of - touch and someone who has spent too much time in the " bubble " and in other rarefied surroundings			1
they point to her gaffes as well as a comment from earlier in the year when she told a group of auto dealers that she had n't driven a car since 1996			0
and while pro-clinton democrats have defended her , others in the party have begun to knock her -- some more subtly than others			0
they also say she 's out of touch			2
vice president @entity225 , who may be running for president , appears to be getting in on the action			0
@entity225 said on monday that he " makes a lot of money " as vice president			0
but he made sure to mention he was " listed as the poorest man in @entity232 " and said he has " no savings account			0
" key point : @entity225 stressed that he 's been " really , really fortunate " compared to the way others have struggled			0
@entity149 is still @entity9 's bogeyman 6 times @entity9 sounded , acted like a candidate			1

@entity2 has now misstepped twice on questions about her wealth
the wealth questions come at the same time that @entity9 has stepped up her populist rhetoric
democrats to the left question @entity9 's economic ideas and coziness with @entity31
*republicans* are trying to create a narrative the @entity9 is out of touch with most @entity129
