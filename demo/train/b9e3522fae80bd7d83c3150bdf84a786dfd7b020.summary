-- @entity1 fastens her helmet , pulls on her gloves and rides her red @entity6 motorcycle out of the courtyard of the @entity8			2
she has already done the daily checks on her motorcycle			2
yes , the chain is adjusted correctly , she has fuel and oil			2
she 's now set for a day vaccinating newborns			2
her journey will take her over an unmade , potholed track that she has been trained to navigate with ease on her little bike			2
@entity1 is a health worker in @entity20 , @entity21			1
she serves about 6,000 people spread over a 20 kilometer area			0
the fact that she has any kind of transport at all marks her out as being very unusual			2
when we first met health workers like @entity1 , they told us that when they did n't have a bike -- which was most of the time -- or , when they have a bike and that it had broken down -- almost always -- they could n't do the job they had been trained for			1
the health workers who serve rural communities in @entity41 are some of the most dedicated people in the world			1
they do n't earn much money and often have to live hundreds of miles away from their families			2
they know that there are people in remote villages who need their help and , when they ca n't reach them , it 's a big burden for them to carry			1
walk for hours at a time			0
in the sun or rain , across tough terrain , carrying whatever they can manage			0
they arrive exhausted , knowing that they do not have long before they must return home			0
it was frustrating to see health workers like @entity1 unable to do their jobs , and women and children who struggle to walk for miles to reach a health center when they get sick			1
there were motorcycles and ambulances that were broken and rusting , simply because no one was trained on how to look after them properly			0
this was 20 years ago			0
the situation was unacceptable and made us angry			0
it is why we re-mortgaged our home and gave up our careers to start @entity82			1
we took big risks to develop an organization that would try to change the status quo			0
we knew we could make a difference			0
it would involve people getting their hands dirty and dealing with spanners and spark plugs and things not normally associated with health care			1
but this was just as important as investing billions of dollars in developing a new vaccine			0
because if the vaccine never reaches the child , what good is it ? we started working with our friends and colleagues in the world of motorcycles			2
to this day , they continue to support our work			0
we also began working with ministries of health in @entity41 countries to put in place technicians , systems for delivering replacement parts and fuel , and training health workers how to look after their own bikes			1
for programs to be sustainable , they have to have their roots in the local communities			0
so all our program teams are led and staffed by local people			0
@entity82 now has programs in seven countries , transforming health care for 14 million people			1
this is not charity -- it is a partnership between governments and an organization that can help them to better serve their people			0
the programs are designed so our partners , including ministries of health , pay for our services			2
by covering the full cost of running their vehicles , even at a not - for - profit rate , it means countries and their health workers are never without transport			1
they can budget for it accordingly , knowing exactly how much it will cost			0
for @entity1 , it means she can do her job well			0
health workers like her can now reach far more people			1
and because they no longer have to walk so much they can spend more time with the people they are caring for			0
she might only be one woman , with one bike , but @entity1 is a symbol for health care across @entity41			1
if every health worker had access to reliable transport we could reach every man , woman and child			1
we could transform lives and end deaths from the preventable diseases that kill millions of people each year			1
we could make sure health care reaches everyone , everywhere			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity82 and @entity82 .			1

@entity175 and @entity82 : health workers in rural @entity41 need help
@entity179 : without reliable transport , they could n't reach and care for the sick
if every health worker had a working bike , we could transform lives , they say
@entity179 : we could end deaths from the preventable diseases that kill millions
