@entity0 , @entity1 -- let those other filmmakers focus on world destruction or masked superheroes or beautiful people doing beautiful things			0
@entity8 plays the owner of an extract factory in " extract , " @entity12 's latest			1
@entity12 prefers to deal with real life			1
judge , writer and director of " @entity16 " and co-creator of the tv series " @entity19 , " has long liked to set his work in the world of malfunctioning copiers and beer - drinking propane salesmen			1
even his wicked satire of the future , " @entity28 , " focused on the inanities of everyday life , just set 500 years from now			1
his new film , " extract , " is no exception : it 's about a factory owner , @entity33 ( @entity8 ) , who must deal with a host of employee problems as well as a chilly wife			1
of course , @entity33 's solutions are n't exactly the stuff of @entity39 , but such is the way of comedy			1
@entity8 understands @entity12 's motivations			1
" he likes to keep everything very middle - of - the - road common people , small town , small problems , relatable , blue - collar , " said the actor , who called judge " a ninja of comedy			1
" " and those people , they run extract factories ; they make drywall			2
i mean , it 's the stuff that we all need often goes unnoticed ; he likes to write about those people , and i 'm glad he does			2
" " extract , " which also stars @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and a long - haired and heavily bearded @entity64 , opens friday			1
judge talked to @entity2 about his subject matter and his cast			2
the following is an edited version of the interview			0
@entity2 : where did this idea come from ? i 'd read that you worked in a factory before			2
@entity12 : yeah , it kind of came from all over the place			1
i 've worked many jobs , and i did work in a factory a couple times -- a place that made guitar amps , and then i worked in a place in @entity85 [ @entity86 ] , where i grew up , that stuffed those snack boxes with @entity88 and candy bars and stuff			1
@entity2 : casting for the film , how did that come together ? did you have a set idea in your head ? judge : when i first wrote the first draft , i was n't thinking about anybody in particular and , then i saw " @entity99 " years later			1
i [ 'd ] put the script on the shelf and thought @entity8 would be perfect , so i did a rewrite thinking about him but no one in particular for the other characters			1
i just wrote it and then just did kind of the normal casting process			0
but then , we were reading people for the character of [ @entity33 's friend ] @entity111 , and my casting director comes in one day and said , " @entity64 is interesting			2
" and i thought , " really , i 've never met the guy			0
" and i [ also ] thought , " yeah , but he 's like strapping , handsome leading - man guy			2
" then i started thinking about it , and i love him when he 's a character actor like in " @entity119 " or " @entity120 , " and then i met him , and he just got it			2
he had this take on him based on a guy he went to high school with			0
we did a read - through the script , and him and @entity8 just killing me , i just thought it was just really funny			1
you know , he was willing to get out of his leading man look and grow a beard			0
@entity2 : it was fun to see him do that			0
it was a different dynamic			0
i think @entity64 , actually , i think he enjoyed being this character			0
i think he has n't gotten to do something like that in a while			0
in fact , we had a big break [ during shooting ]			0
... and he has one scene in the factory , so he had like maybe two or three weeks between the bulk of it and that last scene in it			2
i got the sense he was really happy to come back and put on his " @entity111 " get - up and get back into that character			0
he was just really fun			0
@entity2 : and @entity33 , he 's a nice guy who just wants to have sex with his wife			2
judge : yeah , and i think he , you know , he , he wants kind of simple things , and he 's worked so hard			1
it 's maybe be a little bit of a mid-life crisis he 's going through , i think			2
and he just sort of tests the waters , dips his toe in , doing something a little crazy , and then just everything goes to hell for him			0
@entity2 : we saw this with " @entity16 , " too , making the workplace funny			1
what 's that process like ? judge : well , to me , i think there 's a lot of interesting characters [ at work ] , and just the dynamics of a workplace are really ... funny to me			1
i 've had a lot of jobs , and i think there 's a lot of material there and , i just remember thinking , growing up in the ' 80s , thinking like everyone on tv shows and movies , these characters seem to have like endless cash			1
you never see , [ when you ] become an adult and even as a teenager , it 's like , " ok , i got ta pay my car insurance , and i got ta do this and that			2
" and then you get a job , and it 's like , you 're there all day			0
... i do n't know , i think if your soul does n't get stomped out of you , you can still see the comedy in all of it			0
so i 'd wanted to do something that 's set in more a blue - collar place like a factory , and it 's told from the point of view of the guy who owns it and sympathetic to him instead of the employee angry at the bosses			1
@entity2 : why extract ? are you an extract expert ? judge : ( laughs ) well , there was a couple of reasons			1
there was a book lying around my freshman year in the college dorms that was about food flavoring , and i actually just thought it was kind of interesting			0
then years later , south of @entity231 [ @entity232 ] , there used to be this really great building ; it was the @entity235			0
... my @entity237 one day , we were looking at a house , and he points to a really nice house in this neighborhood , and he says , " that 's where the @entity243 people live			0
" it 's just this odd item that 's in every grocery store in the country , but you do n't think about it much , and when i 'd say that that 's what it 's about , people start laughing			0
so i figured i 'm one step ahead of it there .			0
