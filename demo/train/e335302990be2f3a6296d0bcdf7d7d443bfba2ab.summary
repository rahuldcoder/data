most people might know modern @entity1 for its rising billionaire class , its @entity4 - based information technology hub and its @entity6 celebrity culture			1
but beneath the outward signs of prosperity , @entity1 is still one of the most malnourished nations on the planet			2
according to the 2012 @entity12 from the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) , @entity1 -- despite being one of the world 's largest producers of food -- ranks as low 65 on a list of 79 countries on the index			1
the @entity1 government this week launched an ambitious fight back against food distribution problems that -- alongside countries like @entity25 and @entity26 -- have put it near the top of the list for underweight children under the age of five			1
even by the @entity1 government 's own measure , nearly half of @entity1 's children suffer from malnutrition of some sort			1
the $ 22 billion - a - year welfare scheme aims to sell subsidized wheat and rice to 67 % of its 1.2 billion people			1
the scheme will massively expand an existing program that provides food to 218 million people			2
under the @entity49 , 75 % of rural dwellers and 50 % of the urban population would get five kilograms of grain per month at the subsidized prices of 3 rupees ( us5 cents ) for rice and 2 rupees per kilo for wheat and 1 rupee per kilo for coarse grains to be fixed for a period of three years			2
the existing @entity57 @entity56 ( @entity58 ) , which targets the poorest of the poor , would continue to distribute 35 kilograms of grain per month to those households			0
pregnant women and lactating mothers would get a maternity benefit payment of 6,000 rupees ( us $ 99 ) , while children aged six months to 14 years would get take - home rations or be provided with hot cooked food			2
subsidies would also extend to @entity1 states and territories that run low on grain and there would be central government assistance towards the cost of intra-state transportation and handling of grains			1
critics , however , say that targeting the subsidized grain is likely to be one of the ambitious bill 's biggest headaches			1
distribution through the @entity1 's infamously corrupt state - owned ration shops could see much of the subsidized grain siphoned off to be sold for market prices elsewhere			1
others say the sheer scale of the subsidy will strain government finances			0
the @entity90 , part of the @entity92 , said in a report that the cost of @entity1 's food program is likely to balloon to 6.82 trillion rupees ( $ 126 billion ) in its first three years , meaning the government would have to budget almost double its projected food subsidy each year			1
much of this cost would be associated with scaling up infrastructure to improve the existing distribution system as well as warehousing and transportation			0
@entity1 has had bumper harvests in recent years , according to the @entity104 , leading to the paradox of grain rotting in silos while large swathes of the population are still malnourished			2
@entity1 political and economic analyst @entity110 said he believed the positive impact of the @entity113 would likely to outweigh its problems in the long term , saying that @entity1 would be forced to address problems with its distribution system			2
" you are talking about a system which is bad and that 's the public distribution system			0
you are looking at strengthening the system and that , in itself , should not be such a bad thing , " he told @entity121			0
" nobody is saying there 's no corruption , and nobody is saying that there is no inefficiency , but if by spending this money you improve the system , then that has to be a good thing			0
" he added that even free distribution of grain had support among some sectors of @entity1 society , with double - digit food inflation over the past eight years imposing a greater burden on the poor than it did on @entity1 's growing middle classes			1
" @entity1 society has always been an unequal society historically			0
the food inflation that this country has witnessed in the recent past has made an already unequal society even more unequal , " he said			0
" simply put , the poor spend a larger proportion of their income on food			0
" critics have also charged that the subsidy is the centerpiece of the ruling @entity158 's bid to win a third term in elections due in may , 2014 , and represents a populist policy cynically aimed at winning votes			0
" of course there are politics behind it , but everything has politics behind it , " @entity110 said			0
" whether the poor will vote for @entity158 is a separate story -- only time will tell			0
the fact is that in a country like ours with 1.2 billion people , of which anywhere between 200 - 400 million people are incredibly poor , to have a scheme of cheap food distribution is something that i as an @entity1 favor			1

@entity1 launches ambitious $ 22 billion a year food aid program
