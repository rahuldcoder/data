@entity0 -- reinstalled @entity3 prime minister @entity2 recently announced his @entity4 or " @entity5 " in an effort to halt the escalating number of unauthorized boat arrivals of asylum seekers to @entity3 shores			1
under his plan , all asylum seekers arriving by boat would be transferred to @entity4 for " processing " and no asylum seeker coming by boat would ever obtain permanent resettlement in @entity3 , even if they were subsequently found to be a genuine refugee			1
with an election due sometime before late november , the perception that @entity3 has lost control of its borders is the primary issue in a handful of marginal seats that will decide the election			0
@entity2 is attempting to break the people smuggling business model by removing the possibility that one can arrive by boat seeking asylum and eventually win resettlement in @entity3			1
despite the deliberately harsh rhetoric about the @entity5 that is designed to deter boat arrivals , @entity2 's plan will not be as effective as might first appear			2

" @entity39 has an obvious interest in doing so			0
like all effective policies , the devil is in the detail			0
in this case , the lack of detail for such an important policy announcement is astounding			1
can @entity4 absorb all @entity3 's boat arrivals ? first , there are serious doubts that @entity4 has the capacity to absorb the number of asylum seekers that will try to make it to @entity3 , even if there is an initial deterrent effect following the weekend announcement			1
authorities at @entity4 's @entity62 , the primary location for processing @entity3 - bound boat people , openly admit that current facilities can only house around 300 people			1
given that around 3,500 asylum seekers have been arriving each month since 2013 , even a dramatic slowdown would overburden the @entity62 facilities			0
@entity4 leader prime minister @entity70 has indicated that the country could take in some 3,000 asylum seekers for processing , although no firm ceiling has been put on the ultimate number			2
@entity70 has only indicated that the numbers of asylum seekers that @entity4 is prepared to take will depend on the country 's capacity to do so			0
although temporary tent shelters can be built within weeks to accommodate around 600 people , @entity4 officials have also indicated that permanent facilities to accommodate the 3,000 people will take two years to construct			2
left unanswered is where @entity3 authorities -- who bear responsibility for the asylum seekers at all stages -- would send surplus asylum seekers for processing if @entity4 facilities could no longer cope , as is likely to be the case			1
due to a 2011 @entity98 decision which invalidated the " @entity99 " proposed by previous @entity101 leader @entity100 , @entity96 can not legally send @entity3 - bound asylum seekers to countries that are not signatories to the @entity105 and the @entity106			2
as @entity4 and the @entity108 are the only signatories among @entity3 's neighbors , the suspicion is that @entity3 - bound boat people who can not be processed by @entity4 will have to be processed under @entity3 jurisdiction and resettled in the country if found to be refugees -- which is precisely why growing numbers of boat people are arriving in the first place			1
if so , @entity2 's threat that no asylum seeker arriving by boat will ever gain entry into @entity3 will be demonstrated to be hollow -- which will likely encourage even more asylum seekers to pay smugglers in an attempt to gain @entity3 entry			1
concerns about " culture clash " second , @entity70 has stated that @entity4 will only resettle asylum seekers who have been found to be genuine refugees			2
several questions arise at this point			0
over half of all asylum seekers have been found to be genuine refugees upon arriving in @entity3 , with the number rising to above 90 % after going through the @entity3 judicial appeals process			2
there is already strong political and social opposition in @entity4 to resettling refugees in what is still a vastly undeveloped country			2
given @entity4 's hitherto absent role in accepting refugees , many in the country express concern about an imminent " culture clash " in the event of a refugee influx , while many have openly hostile attitudes towards @entity151 immigrants who would comprise the majority of @entity3 - bound asylum seekers			1
this will only restrict the numbers of refugees that @entity4 would in reality accept , increasing the chances that they will be resettled in @entity3			1
moreover , @entity70 has stated categorically that @entity4 will not allow those asylum seekers who are subsequently found not to be genuine refugees to remain in the country			0
given that all @entity3 - bound asylum seekers remain @entity3 's responsibility even if they are processed in @entity4 under @entity2 's @entity5 , those rejected automatically remain " @entity3 's problem " and under @entity96 's duty of care			1
once again , @entity96 would have few options available besides transferring them to @entity3 facilities			0
can policy stand annual test ? third , the @entity5 is subject to renewal each year , meaning that there will be immense annual pressure on @entity171 to annul what is an extremely unpopular agreement			0
although @entity3 will bear all of the costs for the @entity5 , the plan has not been " costed " meaning that @entity3 are likely to recoil when the true ongoing expense of the proposal becomes clear			0
despite all this , we need to remember that this policy is forged in the midst of an election campaign			0
@entity2 only needs the @entity5 to " stop the boats " for a few weeks in order to somewhat cynically portray the initiative as an ingenious plan			0
short term success in stemming boat arrivals is all @entity2 needs , which is just as well -- because this is all the @entity5 is likely to achieve			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 .			0

@entity3 leader @entity2 plans to send " boat people " to @entity4
plan derided by opposition as flimsy deal ' held together by sticky tape '
@entity192 : lack of detail for important policy is " astounding "
where would @entity3 send refugees if @entity4 could *n't* cope ?
