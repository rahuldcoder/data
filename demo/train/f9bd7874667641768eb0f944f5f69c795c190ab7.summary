if we want to see a live @entity1 , even a tiny microbial one , we may be billions of years too late			1
two new studies in the journal @entity5 this week suggest that the @entity1 atmosphere has n't changed much in terms of chemical composition in the past 4 billion years			1
it 's much thinner than our planet 's atmosphere , and the mix of ingredients is n't friendly to living organisms that are known to us			2
on the plus side , scientists are excited that the atmospheric analyses from instruments on board the @entity1 rover curiosity square with what has been seen from meteorites that have landed on @entity24 from @entity1			2
" in a sense our measurements confirm that those meteorites are from @entity1 , " said @entity25 , program manager of the @entity26 at @entity28 's @entity27 , who led one of the studies			1
the main gas in @entity1 ' atmosphere is carbon dioxide , at a whopping 96 % , according to the scientists			1
@entity24 's atmosphere is mostly nitrogen , at 78 %			0
the @entity1 atmosphere also has very low oxygen content -- 0.1 % -- especially compared with our own atmosphere , which has 19 %			1
more bad news for those who are eager to find life on the @entity1 : the rover has not detected methane so far , @entity25 said			1
this colorless gas is released by organisms as they digest nutrients , so it is an indicator of life , although it can also be produced in geological processes			0
because of the harsh environment on @entity1 , the assumption is that any life that might be there is below the surface , and that it 's microbial			1
" by definition , if we do n't detect methane , it means the probability that that 's happening today is reduced significantly , " he said			0
still , the hunt for methane will continue as @entity69 , the most technologically advanced rover to explore @entity1 , continues its journey			1
where did all that atmosphere go ? @entity1 formed about 4.5 billion years ago			1
scientists believe that , initially , the planet 's atmosphere was 100 times denser than the @entity24 's atmosphere , @entity25 said			2
now it 's only about 1 % as thick as @entity24 's atmosphere			0
so what happened ? sometime more than 4 billion years ago , scientists say , much of the atmosphere was stripped away			1
a leading theory is that the planet was hit hard during the @entity84 , a period in which comets , asteroids and other celestial objects were flying all over the solar system , delivering water to both @entity24 and @entity1			1
one possible idea is that @entity1 was hit by a @entity92 - sized planet , @entity25 said , which knocked out a lot of the atmosphere			1
the sun was also younger and more intense in its output of solar wind and certain kinds of high - energy radiation at that time			0
without a protective magnetic field , @entity1 was vulnerable to high - energy particles from the sun , which is thought to have blown out a lot of the atmosphere , @entity25 said			1
" it was lot of action in the first hundred million years or so , and then it settled down to be the atmosphere that we see today , " he said			2
the curiosity rover has given scientists better evidence than ever that @entity1 was once habitable ; @entity28 announced in march that , based on the chemical analysis of a drilling sample from the rover , life could have existed there in the past			1
the rover found traces of clay that forms in the presence of water , indicating that water once flowed in @entity125 , where the rover landed on august 6 , 2012			0
scientists can not yet say how long that water sloshed around -- was it hundreds of thousands of years ? millions of years ? even hundreds of millions ? " the heavier the atmosphere would be back then , the easier it would be to maintain stable surface temperatures and for water to persist longer , " said @entity131 , chief of the @entity132 in the @entity133 at @entity134 , who led the second science study			2
what we 've done on @entity1 and what 's next how isotopes tell the story in the studies , scientists used instruments in @entity69 's onboard laboratory to study ratios of isotopes ' key elements , such as the carbon and oxygen in carbon dioxide			1
isotopes are different versions of a single chemical element but differ in the number of neutrons , which gives them unique atomic weights			0
isotope ratios indicate a temperature history and other characteristics about the history of a substance , @entity25 said			0
" if the gases in the atmosphere are the fingers on your hands , then the isotope ratios are the individual fingerprints ; they 're very high - resolution detail about the gas , " he said			0
scientists found a higher proportion of heavy isotopes of carbon and oxygen in the @entity1 atmosphere compared with what scientists believe was present in the raw material that went into forming the planet			1
in other words , there has been a loss of lighter isotopes over time			0
that indicates that much of the atmosphere has been lost over time , and that it happened from the top of the atmosphere rather than through interactions with the ground			0
" evidence in the atmosphere of loss of the lighter species -- in carbon , oxygen , hydrogen , and so on -- kind of all point toward a process where the top of the atmosphere is eroding away into space , " @entity131 said			0
@entity25 and @entity131 each used a different @entity206 instrument but came up with nearly the same ratios of carbon - 12 to carbon - 13 , indicating accuracy			0
what else to come curiosity has a sophisticated suite of instruments on board , but other probes may be able to get a better handle on what 's going on with the planet 's atmosphere			2
in november , @entity28 will launch the @entity221 ( @entity222 ) orbiter , which will try to measure the current rate of loss of the atmosphere , @entity131 said			0
with that information , scientists can extrapolate back billions of years and calculate more precisely when it was that the atmosphere was thick and hospitable to life			1
there are also plans for a 2020 @entity28 rover mission			0
that mission 's science team said in a recent report that it should look for indications that life once existed on the planet , collect samples for potential return to @entity24 and test technology relevant to human exploration			2
as of wednesday , @entity69 had driven a total of more than a kilometer ( 0.62 miles ) since landing last year			0
it is currently progressing toward @entity244 , which is composed of many layers that represent a record of geological time			0
by climbing this mountain and sampling layers along the way , the rover will unearth more clues about how the @entity1 environment evolved in the course of the planet 's history			2
the $ 2.5 billion mission has already fulfilled the goal of showing that @entity1 was once habitable			2
the question remains : for whom ? follow @entity261 on @entity262 at @ lizlandau			0

new measurements of @entity1 ' atmosphere are not promising for current life on that planet
@entity1 formed about 4.5 billion years ago
its atmosphere was stripped away by sun , *bombardment*
@entity69 found that life could have existed on @entity1 in the *distant* past
