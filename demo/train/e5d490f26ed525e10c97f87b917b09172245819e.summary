people of the @entity2 faith in northern @entity3 face an impossible choice : stay and risk being killed by @entity6 insurgents , or flee across the barren desert , facing starvation and thirst			1
its hard to imagine the suffering that minority @entity2 have endured in recent weeks as they 've fled from @entity13 militants into remote , rugged , sparse mountains			1
" with my own eyes , i saw dogs feeding off dead bodies , " one of those @entity2 , a man named @entity16 , told @entity18			1
" it 's not a crisis			0
" descendants of @entity26 and followers of an ancient @entity29 religion , @entity2 are small in number with a big sense of community			1
now some of them are under siege or under fire , targeted by @entity13 for not succumbing to demands to convert to @entity38 or else			1
others , like @entity16 , have managed to find some refuge in recent days , though worries remain about finding the resources they need to survive			0
wherever they are , whatever they are doing , @entity2 do n't feel safe or secure or free			2
they certainly are n't home			0
yazidis trapped , hiding from @entity13 in the mountains ' we had nothing ' the 33 - year - old @entity16 's nightmare began in his home village of @entity50 at 9 a.m. on august 3			1
that 's when he and others started receiving calls from neighboring villages , telling them " @entity55 , " the @entity57 term for @entity13 , was on their doorsteps			2
the choices were simple : stay , convert to @entity38 , and become one with @entity13			1
stay and risk death or imprisonment , as @entity16 said he knew happened to a family of one man , three women and four children			0
or run away , in hopes of finding some place they could live safely or , at least , freely away from @entity13 ' grasp			2
more than 300 @entity2 families -- @entity16 among them -- picked the third option			2
their first refuge was the abandoned ruins of a tiny , old village that had been previously used for herding cattle and sheep and was next to a cement factory			0
an @entity13 messenger caught up with them there to deliver an ultimatum : convert by noon the next day or die			1
@entity16 and his neighbors fled again , this time up @entity86			0
they followed a zig - zagging road five kilometers ( three miles ) up to the mountain 's desolate top			0
the hundreds of @entity2 , including many elderly and children , had each other			2
but not much else , having escaped with little more than the clothes on their backs and the bread in their hands			0
@entity13 militants choked off any chance of restocking by surrounding the roads leading up to the mountain			1
" at one point , 15 people shared 1.5 gallons of water , " @entity16 recalled			0
" people drop to ground of hunger if @entity13 fighters did n't kill the @entity2 , their siege did			1
@entity16 's 80 - year - old father was among the dead , dying two days after being stranded on the mountaintop in the extreme heat without anything to eat or drink			1
@entity16 said he counted between 500 and 1,000 bodies , some of which went from cherished loved ones one moment to food for hungry dogs the next			1
" i saw people dropping on the ground from being so tired on their empty stomachs , " he told @entity18			0
@entity16 , at least , is alive			0
fighters with the @entity128 -- or @entity128 , which the @entity129 labels a terrorist group though they now share a common enemy in @entity13 -- were able to break the siege so that he and other @entity2 could safely escape			1
the subsequent journey took them through parts of northern @entity3 , across the border into @entity137 , then eventually back to @entity3			2
their last stop -- for now -- is a village in @entity142 province that @entity16 characterized as being " in the middle of nowhere			0
" still , even if he 's safe for now , the danger has n't gone away			0
first off , @entity13 has n't backed off			2
the @entity146 military noted saturday that the militants " indiscriminately attacked " yazidis near the @entity86 , prompting @entity146 airstrikes			0
officials : @entity146 airstrikes pound @entity13 attacks are n't the only reasons @entity2 ' lives are at risk			1
thousands of them do n't have the food or water they need , especially in @entity3 's scorching summer			1
" there are more than 20,000 families still stranded on the mountain in more remote areas , " @entity16 said			0
" if no one gets them food or water in time , they will face death			0
