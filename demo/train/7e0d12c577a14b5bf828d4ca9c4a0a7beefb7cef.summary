@entity0 -- @entity4 investigators interviewed @entity5 twice , well before he scaled a @entity7 fence with a large knife in his pocket , determining both times that they did n't have enough reason to keep him , a law enforcement official told @entity1 on tuesday			1
@entity13 , a 42 - year - old @entity14 war veteran who apparently suffers from @entity15 , hopped the north fence late last friday and sprinted just inside the north portico @entity7 doors before being stopped , @entity4 spokesman @entity12 has said			1
at the time -- which happened to be mere minutes after president @entity20 and his daughters flew via helicopter from the @entity23 to @entity24 -- @entity5 had a @entity26 folding knife with a 3Â½ - inch serrated blade in his pants , according to an affidavit			0
in his car , he had more than 800 rounds of ammunition , two hatchets and a machete			0
@entity4 beefs up presence an official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said soon after the incident that @entity5 was known to the @entity4 even if he had n't been arrested by the agency before			1
on tuesday , the details of these interactions became clearer			0
investigators from the @entity4 -- whose mission includes protecting @entity45 leaders -- interviewed @entity5 after his july 19 arrest in @entity47 , @entity48 , on charges of possessing a shotgun and sniper rifle as well as eluding and evading arrest			1
@entity53 contacted the @entity4 after tying @entity5 to a map with a circle around the @entity7 or a line pointing to it , said the law enforcement official			1
the @entity58 and the @entity59 were also notified			0
the discovery of the map led @entity4 investigators to ask @entity5 standard protective intelligence questions and then let him go after determining that he did not pose a threat to the president , according to the law enforcement official			1
" that could easily be explained as somebody who wants to tour @entity0 , " the official said of the map , explaining why it was n't tied to any devious plot			0
just over a month later , on august 25 , @entity4 agents stopped @entity5 outside the @entity7 's @entity23 after noticing he was carrying a camping hatchet			1
the agency knew then of the @entity48 incident , and the related @entity4 interview , from the previous month , the law enforcement official said			2
once again , @entity4 investigators talked to @entity5 at the agency 's @entity0 field office			2
the law enforcement official said that -- after getting permission from @entity5 -- the @entity4 found empty gun cases in his car			1
investigators figured the cases were empty because @entity5 's guns were seized in the july arrest , the official said			1
when asked why the @entity4 did n't detain @entity5 at this point , the law enforcement official responded , " for what ? ... we ca n't randomly commit people			1
" @entity5 's former stepson , @entity90 , told @entity1 's @entity91 that @entity5 suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and paranoia			0
@entity90 said @entity5 's mental state seemed to deteriorate after each of his three deployments to @entity14			0
the @entity4 is reviewing security policies and procedures in light of last friday 's incident at the @entity7 , as well as one the following day			2
in that separate incident saturday , a man -- identified by @entity12 as @entity103 resident @entity102 -- was arrested on an unlawful entry charge after he allegedly drove up to a security barrier and tried to walk to and enter the @entity7			2
in addition to its internal review , the @entity4 in recent days has done things such as increasing the number of officers patrolling near the @entity7 and boosting surveillance measures			2
the agency has also set up a makeshift fence -- basically bike racks zip - tied together -- along the @entity116 as a temporary response to friday 's incident , according to the law enforcement official			0
may : lost driver ends up in @entity7 motorcade @entity1 's @entity122 reported from @entity0 , and @entity1 's @entity123 reported and wrote from @entity124			0
@entity1 's @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 contributed to this report .			0
