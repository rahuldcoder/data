five things to know about guns the bill , which passed on april 3 and was signed into law by @entity21 the following day , banned more than 100 types of assault weapons , called for background checks on all weapon sales -- including private sales -- and created the nation 's first dangerous weapon offender registry			1
" a 139 - page bill was assembled behind closed doors , bypassing both the public hearing and committee processes , and quickly sent to floor votes on the same day in both the @entity51 and @entity52 , where legislators did not have adequate time to even read the bill , " @entity43 , senior vice president and general counsel of the @entity10 , said in a news release			1
states tighten , loosen gun laws after @entity2 " our suit focuses on this abuse of process that has resulted in enacted law that does nothing to improve public safety , while resulting in adverse effects on law - abiding citizens , manufactures , retailers and sportsmen 's organizations			2
