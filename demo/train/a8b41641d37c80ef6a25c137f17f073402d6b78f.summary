masked men with metal rods and @entity3 cocktails prowl the @entity6 flag - draped balcony , surveying the crowds below			0
stacks of tires topped with ribbons of razor wire line a makeshift barricade around the main entrance			0
two days after smashing their way in , hundreds of protesters have transformed this government building in the industrial city of @entity18 , eastern @entity19 , into the self - declared " @entity20 of @entity18			1
" from the clumsily erected bulwarks to the lack of a leader or concrete plan , the scenes are similar to the pro-european rallies in @entity28 's @entity27 in recent months , with one major difference : many of these protesters say they want to join @entity6 and have called for a referendum on secession from @entity19 to be held by may 11			1
the protesters who let us into the building are eager to show they are here entirely peacefully , but it is clear they are prepared for a fight			0
doors have been locked and stairwells blocked at the top of the building to prevent the @entity19 military from storming in from above			1
they 've smashed the pavement outside the building to use as stones			0
a makeshift hospital and temporary cafe have been constructed , and locals are keeping the men and women inside stocked up on food and medical supplies			0
some of the protesters inside the building are happy to see us ; others seem ready to attack us with their bats at a moment 's notice			0
one of the older men asks us why @entity63 are sticking their nose into @entity19 affairs			0
@entity6 warns of civil war if @entity19 uses force to quell eastern revolts one man tells us that he 's from the @entity70 , a new local group , and that help is on the way			1
he says there are 6,000 members of his group who stand ready to " protect the fatherland			0
" others are hopeful that a vote to secede from @entity19 can be held sooner than protesters announced monday			2
when the power went out monday night , many inside believed @entity19 's special forces were coming to retake the building			2
but the @entity19 military is nowhere to be seen , and the mood of the protesters is growing ever more defiant			1
@entity18 is the hometown of ousted @entity19 president @entity87 , whose @entity89 government was toppled in a popular revolt in february			1
nobody knows for sure what role , if any , @entity6 is playing in this latest bout of unrest in @entity19			2
acting @entity19 president @entity95 blames " separatist groups coordinated by @entity6 special services " for the revolts in eastern @entity19 , which he said echoed events leading to the @entity6 annexation of @entity102 three weeks ago			1
since then , @entity6 has amassed thousands of troops on its border with eastern @entity19			1
and @entity6 's @entity105 said reports that protesters are facing a crackdown by @entity19 authorities are of particular concern			1
" we are calling for the immediate cessation of any military preparations , which could lead to civil war , " it said in a statement on its official website			0
protesters say that local complaints , not @entity119 , are driving anti-government sentiments here in @entity18			0
one man , who calls himself @entity121 , says that @entity19 's ongoing political crisis has hit his wages and that he can no longer afford to feed his family			0
he tells me that he has simply had enough			0
@entity19 officials say they wo n't storm the building for now			1
but the acting president says those who have seized buildings will be treated as " terrorists " and prosecuted with the full force of the law			2
in the meantime , protesters say they will continue to fortify their makeshift fortress in @entity18 , and their tiny pocket of grievances and whims , despite its size , seems to now be on the front line of a massive struggle for the future of @entity19			1
