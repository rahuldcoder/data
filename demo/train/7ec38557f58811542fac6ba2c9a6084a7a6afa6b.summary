@entity3 and @entity5 , stars of the hotly anticipated " @entity2 " movie , opened up to @entity6 about everything from what drew them to their characters to sculpting their bodies for nude scenes to visiting a sex dungeon in preparation for the film			1
@entity5 , the daughter of actors @entity16 and @entity18 , plays @entity2 , a naive young woman who finds herself ensnared in the dark sexual world of @entity2 , a successful businessman with a penchant for bondage and domination			1
the film is based on the book trilogy by @entity27 that took the publishing world by storm			1
fans of the book are eager for the @entity33 's weekend release			1
the story is not without its detractors , some of whom have criticized the relationship between @entity39 and @entity40 as abusive and not true to the @entity42 community			1
why i do n't want my daughters to see ' @entity2 ' @entity5 addressed the criticism , calling @entity40 a positive example of a woman exploring her sexuality			1
still , @entity3 told @entity6 he felt protective of @entity5 , who was placed in vulnerable situations during filming			1
director @entity51 also explained why @entity5 is perfect for the role			1
" @entity2 " will be released on february 13			1
the march issue of @entity6 hits newsstands february 10 and is available online now			1
@entity6 : best trends to try in 2015 excerpts from the interview are below : on chasing the hottest roles in @entity58 ... @entity5 : i had read the books and was drawn to the character of @entity62 because she 's private , loving , honest -- and because she and @entity39 are both incredibly intelligent , confident , and can spar with each other on every level			1
i auditioned for two months			1
i met with @entity51 a bunch of times			1
so when i found out i had the part , i think i started crying			1
i was relieved the not - knowing was over			1
click here to view a " @entity2 " slideshow on @entity6 @entity51 : @entity70 was everything that i wanted in @entity40			1
she has a strong sense of who she is , but at the same time there 's a sweetness about her			1
it was tough to find @entity39 because , on the page , he 's perfect			1
in real life there are n't so many people that tick all those boxes : to be able to be charismatic and charming , successful , wealthy , and devastatingly handsome			1
@entity3 : at first , i did n't audition			1
i made a tape in @entity85 with a casting director			1
i did n't hear anything until they cast @entity89 ( @entity89 )			2
i thought it was kind of funny to say that i 'd auditioned to play @entity39 and failed miserably			2
then whatever happened with ( @entity89 ) happened , and the doors opened again			2
click here to watch a behind - the - scenes video interview of @entity5 and @entity3 on @entity6 on becoming @entity40 and @entity39 ... @entity96 : i had to do a lot of work to get in shape because @entity39 's someone who 's very anal about that			1
but it was n't six hours a day			2
you do n't want to turn to your heavily pregnant wife and say , " i 'm going to the gym for six hours			2
text me if you go into labor			2
" @entity70 : @entity3 and @entity108 actually shared a trainer			1
it was important to me that @entity62 's body look like that of an active college student			2
and i was going be naked , so i wanted to look good			2
i did a lot of working out and had more waxing than any woman should have ! @entity6 : 27 @entity117 @entity96 : in that six weeks before filming , my daughter was born			1
it was just an insane time			2
for research , one rainy tuesday evening , i kissed the wife and baby good night and went to watch a dominant - submissive session in a dungeon			2
the dominant was our sort of adviser on the job			2
he 'd be on hand anytime there was a scene in the @entity133 ( @entity39 's playroom for bondage , discipline , sadism and masochism ) , to say , " you 're doing that wrong			2
" so i watched him do his thing			2
... it was quite jovial , a very different approach to how i saw @entity39 being in the @entity133			2
i think @entity39 takes it a bit more seriously			2
@entity70 : i did n't go to the sex dungeon			1
i wanted to keep myself distanced from it at first because i wanted @entity62 's reaction to certain things to be completely honest and real , like new			2
but i did do a lot of reading about the culture of @entity42			2
it 's about the ebb and flow of control between two people			0
to me , there 's something really honest in wanting to completely give up control for just a second			0
@entity6 : @entity160 's workout moves for miniskirt - ready legs on entering the @entity162 ... @entity70 : the scenes in that room were definitely the most vulnerable scenes in the movie			1
but it was a very closed set -- my mom told me that it 's my right to ask for that during intimate scenes , so it seemed like ( @entity3 and @entity51 and i ) were in this little world together			1
@entity96 : some of the @entity133 stuff was uncomfortable			0
there were times when @entity70 was not wearing much , and i had to do stuff to her that i 'd never choose to do to a woman			0
@entity6 : 46 @entity179 @entity70 : it 's stressful enough to be tied to a bed naked in a scene			1
but then they call cut , and you 're still tied to the bed , naked			0
@entity3 would be the first one to throw a blanket over me			1
@entity96 : i felt very protective and aware that it probably was n't easy for her to be put in those situations , and exposed			0
and @entity51 , as a director , has an amazing quality of making everyone feel very relaxed			0
@entity51 : we left anything that was emotionally difficult or of a sexual nature until the last few weeks of filming			0
by that point we had time to get to know each other , to build that trust , which was important to be able to go into the next realm			0
those days on set were calm , but you could definitely feel tension			0
@entity6 : 25 celebrity hairstyles that will make you want @entity206 on fans , haters and the countdown to megastardom ... @entity96 : i ( already ) get , " @entity212 , you 're @entity2 ! " ( out in public )			1
and i say , " no , i 'm @entity3 ! i 'm an actor			1
" when the film comes out , there will probably be more of that			1
i do n't think you can prepare for that			0
you ca n't put up sandbags , get rations in			0
i just live my life			0
i 've had the same friends since i was a small boy			0
none of them do what i do or , frankly , give a sh * t about what i do			0
we just love each other			0
the one thing i take comfort in is that none of that is going anywhere , no matter what the perception of me is or what happens in my career			0
@entity70 : i 'm proud of ( the movie )			0
i completely disagree with people who think @entity62 's weak			0
i think she 's actually stronger than he is			0
everything she does is her choice			0
and if i can be an advocate for women to do what they want with their bodies and not be ashamed of what they want , then i 'm all for that			0
my mom came up for a day [ during filming ]			0
she 's proud of me			0
but i do n't want my family to see [ the movie ] , because it 's inappropriate			0
or my brothers ' friends , who i grew up with			0
i think they 'd be like , @entity260 ( mimics vomiting )			0
also there 's part of me that 's like , i do n't want anyone to see this movie			0
on their turn - ons ... @entity96 : i 've got a thing for great hands			0
my wife ( @entity269 ) has my favorite hands in the world			0
being from @entity272 , i 'm programmed to enjoy stories , so i find it sexy if a woman can tell a funny story			0
and i 've always found attractive talking to someone who 's achieved something that i could n't			0
@entity70 : like @entity3 , i like good hands			1
i grew up in @entity282 , and there are manly men there , so manliness is attractive to me			0
i think it 's unsexy when a man chews with his mouth open or when a man is rude or wears fedoras			0
oh @entity212 , i can find more things i hate about men than i like			0
i think it 's just a phase ! @entity6 : 10 things he 's thinking when you 're naked			1
