-- when i returned home from the @entity3 weekend three months ago , i was tired and overwhelmed , and every muscle in my body ached			1
this past week , my teammates and i wrapped up our " midway " training trip in @entity9 , @entity10			1
i am proud and excited to report that the experience left me feeling exhilarated , confident and energized ! the best part is that it 's not because of any magic pill or potion ; it is the result of making a commitment to myself to become healthier			1
behind the scenes : training for a triathlon i am an overweight 57 - year - old , soon - to - be - retired grandmother			1
i love a challenge and am one of those people who is not afraid to step out my comfort zone for a worthy goal			2
during kickoff weekend , we were promised that the first few months would be base - building			2
we were given an overview of basic swimming techniques , tips to help our running form and information on healthy nutrition			2
we received workouts on a weekly basis that were designed for each of us to develop our endurance , skill and strength			2
it was up to each of us whether we did them , how much effort we put into each session and what we put into our bodies			2
i have not been perfect in any of these areas , but life is about progress , not perfection			2
and i can absolutely say that i have made progress ! training dedicated to slain colleague in january , i could not even put my face in the water , let alone swim			1
thanks to the patience and teaching of my coaches and teammates , i arrived in @entity10 holding my own in the pool			1
by the end of the week , not only had i gained more confidence , i had my very first experience in the ocean			1
once we survived putting our wetsuits on , we headed into the water at @entity65			2
completely out of my comfort zone , i was content to watch my teammates as they enthusiastically ran into the water toward the waves			0
i had to laugh when one of the producers , who was in the water with us , said to me , " so , @entity76 , you know that the swim in @entity78 is in the @entity79 , right ? " i did know that , i told him , but swimming in a pool had been such an overwhelming undertaking for me that i had not spent much time actually processing how much different swimming in the ocean was going to be			1
that was the moment that i knew i had to take the leap and actually get into water above my knees			0
i figured i might as well literally dive in and give it a try			0
not only did i live to tell about it , i can honestly say it was a blast , and i ca n't wait to do it again ! as i 'm more than 20 years older than the rest of the team , there have been a few times that i thought i would have to accept reality -- that i would not be able to do everything they could			1
the ocean experience was definitely one of them			1
i figured that if it was n't something i had accomplished by now , i probably never would			1
it was exhilarating to find out that i was wrong			0
even more important , it was just what i needed to move me past thinking that way in the future			0
similar things happened on the bike and on the road			0
even though it is not something i have done a lot of the past few years , i have always enjoyed riding a bicycle			0
i had no idea what a different experience riding a road bike with my feet clipped in the pedals would be			0
my first two rides were pretty traumatic , and i have the scars on my knees and elbows to prove it			0
again , thanks to mentoring and practice , it turns out that i am not too shabby on the bike			0
much to my surprise , i enjoy the long bike rides and the accomplishment of making it to the top of a hill that looked impossible from the bottom			0
the key to fitness ? schedule it in i have progressed from walking on the treadmill for 2 miles three times a week to actually running the entire distance of a 5.38 - mile course on the clay trails outside of @entity9 -- another thing i did n't think i could do , even as we were in the car on our way to the trail			1
the euphoria that i had at the finish line of our first practice triathlon made me forget the struggle to get there			1
the best part is that feeling lasted for the rest of the day			0
here 's what i realized at the conclusion of the midway training trip : i will complete the triathlon this fall			1
i can actually see myself crossing the finish line with my awesome teammates and the new friends whom i have met along the way			1
it is hard for me to put into words , but i also realized that this experience is about more than the triathlon itself			0
being outside of my comfort zone , both mentally and physically , has helped me conquer my fears and self - doubt			0
it has given me the courage and confidence to keep working toward my goals and dreams , no matter how lofty			0
