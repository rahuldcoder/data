-- keeping a sense of mystery is 2014 's definition of sexy , at least according to @entity5			1
the men 's publication has named @entity8 , one of @entity10 's most notoriously private stars , as this year 's " @entity11			1
" @entity12 follows in the footsteps of previous winners like @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17			0
but being the newly crowned " @entity11 " has n't made @entity12 any more revealing			2
she has one drama , " @entity19 , " set to bow this year in @entity20 , and is filming the comedy " @entity24 " with @entity22 and @entity23			0
the @entity26 winner was tight - lipped about both projects with @entity5 and was similarly elusive about her relationship with fellow actor @entity29			2
the couple tied the knot in 2010 and now have a 3 - year - old son and a 1 - year - old daughter , but neither star has been eager to share details of parenthood			0
" that is for us , " @entity12 explained to @entity5 , adding that her family 's the reason you do n't often see her in the public eye			1
as far as her new title of " @entity11 , " @entity12 was just as tight - lipped			0
she feels more " like a mother who does n't get enough sleep , " @entity5 says , than the magazine 's newest title - holder			2
but on the other hand , " assume a virtue , if you have it not			0
" what do you think of @entity5 's choice ? tweet @ @entity56 or tell us on @entity58 .			1
