editor 's note : @entity2 is chief executive of @entity3 , a global management consulting firm , and the author of " @entity6 : a short guide to leading a @entity8 "			1
he writes a weekly column , how we work , for @entity12			1
@entity2 says you ca n't make your luck , but you can control how you 'll react to what happens			1
@entity16 ( @entity17 ) -- there is a @entity20 story about a poor farmer whose one horse ran away			2
all his neighbors came to him in sympathy , saying " what bad luck ! " " maybe , " he responded			1
the next day the horse returned with several other wild horses			2
" what great luck ! " his neighbors exclaimed			1
" maybe , " he responded			2
a few days later the farmer 's son was trying to tame one of the wild horses when he was thrown off and broke his leg			2
" what terrible luck ! " his neighbors said			1
" maybe , " he responded			2
a week later the army came through the village to draft all the young men but seeing the broken leg of the farmer 's son , they left him in peace			2
" what wonderful luck ! " the neighbors said			1
" maybe , " the farmer responded			2
my life is a series of lucky accidents strung together starting from the moment of my conception			2
i was a diaphragm baby			2
in college i was planning to go into politics			2
then in the spring of my junior year the bicycle trip i had planned to go on was cancelled because the leader broke her arm			2
so instead i went on a camping trip and it changed my life			2
i soon gave up politics and began teaching leadership on wilderness expeditions			2
and on one of those expeditions i met the woman who would eventually become my wife			0
later i built a successful company teaching leadership with lots of employees and several offices around the world			0
then , as luck would have it , my company crashed along with the economy and the @entity75			1
it turns out , after some introspection and a solid dose of therapy , that i was n't enjoying the business the way i had built it the first time			1
so i rebuilt it in a much smaller , sustainable and fulfilling way			0
while i might not have been happy about it at the time , each turn of luck was a catalyst that brought me closer to the life that i 'm happily living now			1
often we operate with the impression that we are in control of our lives			1
i remember long conversations with my wife , @entity96 , about exactly when we should have our second child			0
two miscarriages later we realized it was n't up to us			1
and when @entity100 eventually came , we knew that any time would have been the right time			0
some strokes of luck are small			1
maybe you enjoy a conversation with someone new			0
maybe you read a poem that happened to be sitting on someone 's desk			0
maybe you bump into the car in front of you			0
only years later can you see how fundamentally that moment may have changed your life			0
some strokes of luck are big and you know at the time they will change your life			1
maybe you win $ 10 million with a lottery ticket you did n't even know you had , as recently happened to a woman in @entity121			1
maybe you lose your job			0
what we do n't know is how those things will change our lives			1
all the research points to how poor we are at predicting how we 'll feel about something once it happens to us			0
lottery winners are no happier than before			0
paraplegics are no less happy			0
and there 's something i 've been noticing about people who have lost their jobs recently			0
but in many cases , the fear of losing your job is worse than losing your job			0
i know a large number of employed people who are miserable on two counts : they hate their jobs and they 're afraid of losing them			0
they 're scared and stuck			0
but once you lose your job you can move on			0
@entity153 , professor of psychology at @entity155 , explained this phenomenon in a recent @entity158 article , " @entity159			0
" " when we get bad news we weep for a while , and then get busy making the best of it			0
we change our behavior , we change our attitudes			1
... an uncertain future leaves us stranded in an unhappy present with nothing to do but wait			0
" so when your luck changes , what should you do about it ? @entity175 psychologist @entity174 has done a tremendous amount of research to understand what makes someone give up in the face of adversity versus strive to overcome it			1
her research shows that if someone believes his talent is inborn he 'll give up quickly , because any obstacle is a sign of his limitation			0
he 's hit a wall ; he ca n't do something and wo n't ever be able to			1
but if someone believes her talent grows with persistence and effort , she 'll work to master the challenge			0
she 'll view adversity as an opportunity to get better			0
so here 's the good news : you can change your results by changing your mind - set			1
when @entity174 trained children to view themselves as capable of growing their intelligence , they worked harder , more persistently , and with greater success on math problems they had previously abandoned as unsolvable			0
no matter how well we plan our lives , we 're not fully in control			1
but how we face our luck -- good and bad -- is in our control			1
how 's this year going ? are you having good luck ? bad luck ? maybe			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : so much of our lives is ruled by luck
@entity2 says we ca n't control luck but can *decide* how we react to it
he says studies show you can change your results by changing your mindset
