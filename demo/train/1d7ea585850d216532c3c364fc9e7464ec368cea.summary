-- so now we 're having a debate about spanking			2
seriously ? there is a lot of misplaced outrage from folks who are taking recent stories about the misconduct of professional athletes and shoehorning them into a crusade against child abuse			1
i 'm against child abuse			1
who is n't ? but i 'm not against spanking			1
i have my reasons , and we 'll get to them			0
first , let 's deal with the misplaced outrage			2
why do n't the folks who are worked up over the fact that @entity23 running back @entity24 was indicted last week on a felony charge of child abuse just say what 's really on their mind ? on the heels of the @entity31 story , where a videotape was recently released showing the suspended @entity33 running back hitting and knocking unconscious his then @entity36 ( now his wife ) in a hotel elevator , there are those who want to tie these two stories together under the template that some of the violence of the @entity43 may be spilling out onto players ' personal lives and the rest of society			1
if that 's the assertion , then let 's have that discussion			2
but let 's not mix all that noise together with the more important debate over spanking children			1
we have to get this right , and -- as the parent of three young children , ages 5 , 6 , and 7 , who has been to more than his share of picnics , birthday parties , and little league games -- i can see firsthand we 're getting it wrong			0
i remember seeing one hapless father chasing after his son , trying to get the boy to listen and pleading : " you need to respect me			2
" the lad ignored him			0
when did parents become such wimps ? my dad did n't roll like that			1
and neither did his father , a @entity77 immigrant who -- along with my equally strong and no - nonsense grandmother -- raised five boys from the 1930s to the 1950s with nary an incident			0
there were no disturbances , no gangs , no police			0
later , i teased one of my uncles about that , suggesting they must have had a lot of respect for law or order			0
" heck no , " he said			0
" we were all terrified of the old man			0
" fear is essential to respect			1
children wo n't do what we tell them to do , unless -- at some level -- they fear the consequences that will come from not doing it			1
punishment is n't a bad word			0
it 's a life lesson			1
it 's the way the world works , and , as parents , it 's our job to prepare our kids to enter a world where they learn bad behavior has consequences			1
too many parents today are falling down on the job			1
the problem is n't that too many kids get spanked			1
it 's that some kids who need a spanking might never get one			1
opinion : spanking is n't parenting ; it 's child abuse ten years ago , the problem was that too many parents eager to be their child 's @entity125 ( @entity124 ) were losing the battle to discipline their children , instill values , influence behavior and teach right from wrong			1
today , in many homes , the battle is over and the kids won			2
in some cases , the parents -- already stressed from long days at work and having no desire to spend precious hours at home squabbling with children -- simply surrendered			2
they gave up on raising children in exchange for peace and quiet on the home front			0
now the kids run things			0
these pint - sized ceos of the household tell their parents what to do , instead of the other way around			2
if mom and dad forget their place in the new world order , junior will simply throw a few verbal daggers and scream : " you 're so mean ! i hate you ! " the correct response should be : " i can live with that			0
now go to your room ! " i 'm not telling anything you do n't already know			2
if it 's not happening in your house , it 's happening in your brother 's or cousin 's or neighbor 's			0
opinion : does spanking harm the black community ? so let me put in a good word for spanking as an acceptable and sometimes necessary form of disciplining a child , as long as you follow the rules			1
here are three : never use a belt or other foreign object , just the palm on your hand ; never hit a child on his bare bottom , only through clothing ; and only give them one swat , where you maintain control of your emotions			0
this is a sensitive subject around my house			0
my wife and i disagree about spanking			0
she thinks you should never use violence to discipline a child			2
but the result of that is my kids sometimes torment mommy to test their boundaries			0
they want to see just what they can get away with and how far they can push before she cracks and loses her cool			0
it 's excruciating to watch			0
the cultural , regional and generational roots of spanking too many kids in @entity214 do n't respect their parents -- that 's the real threat			1
they turn on the television and see shows where the kids run things and the parents are bumbling idiots			2
in fact , many kids do n't fear any kind of authority , and this will not serve them well later in life			1
that 's the real sin that many parents commit , neglecting their duty to raise good kids who grow up into respectful and responsible adults			1
spanking is n't child abuse			1
and that 's something that every parent needs -- but , as you already know , not every parent has .			0

@entity242 : i 'm against child abuse . who is n't ? but i 'm not against spanking
@entity242 : spanking is an acceptable way to discipline a child , as long as you follow the rules
he says too many kids in @entity214 today do n't respect their parents - that 's the real threat
@entity242 : many kids do n't fear any kind of authority , and this will not serve them well in life
