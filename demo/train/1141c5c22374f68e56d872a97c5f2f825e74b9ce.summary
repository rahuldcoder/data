a great football team combines inherent violence with a certain order , always imposed by the coaches and team leaders			1
famed @entity6 coach @entity5 allowed very little humor and made it abundantly clear that there would be no racism in his organization			1
regardless of intent , any racist remark by a player was deemed malicious and resulted in instant dismissal from the team			2
the culture was established at the top			1
leaders like @entity20 were the enforcers in the locker room , along with @entity5 's " @entity23 , " a group of hand - picked players who communicated directly with him			1
the @entity26 would have done well to take a page from @entity5			1
on wednesday , the @entity26 fired offensive line coach @entity28 and head athletic trainer @entity29			1
it was the latest flareup in an ongoing , ugly controversy over bullying , leadership and @entity35 locker - room realities , one that has some of the characteristics of a wildfire : the slightest breeze ignites it for a fresh run over highly flammable terrain			1
and now the heat has reached the top floor : the firings apparently came at the behest of team owner @entity46 , who , news reports said , conducted his own investigation into the treatment of @entity50 by fellow player @entity51 and others -- and the role their teammates , coaches and front office have played in the @entity26 ' locker room culture			1
that 's significant , since owners normally leave such issues to coaches			2
the @entity26 melodrama is a sad story of too much smart - ass talk and not enough supervision			1
the team 's leadership should have laid down specific guidelines regarding acceptable discussion of race and gender preference and about outright harassment			2
this was clear from the beginning			2
the team has suffered , and from the trainer to the owner , everyone -- literally everyone -- is affected			1
it should have never gotten this far			0
whether @entity46 ' firm action this week is sufficient to restore order to the @entity26 is open to question , since players have weighed in on both sides			1
someone should have shut the guys ' mouths on day one			0
normally , that would come from within the team and coaches			0
i have a long view on this culture			1
last fall marked the first season in 58 years that i was not employed full - time in a football job			1
fourteen of those years were spent in the @entity35 -- 10 as a player ( including with @entity5 's @entity6 ) -- and i wake up each morning with painful reminders			1
they seem a small price to pay for having competed in the greatest team sport ever devised			0
with all the sometimes absurd chatter over the @entity26 ' story , it must be difficult for thinking people to know or understand how the team 's situation could have developed			1
maybe i can add perspective -- to explain , if not to completely excuse			0
football is the only sport in which every player needs every teammate on every play just to survive			1
simply put , everybody matters			0
football locker rooms are loaded with alpha males , and daily conflicts are inevitable			1
my sensitive , scholarly friend , writer @entity117 , joined us with the @entity119 when we were @entity120 champions and actually played four plays against @entity122 in @entity123 before 104,000 fans			0
as we left the field , he turned to me and said , " that is the most disgusting experience in my life ! you guys are deranged ! i have never felt such palpable hatred in my life ! " i said " that was not hatred ; it was intensity			0
we are competitors ! " he was inconsolable , and our argument continued until he decided we should do a book about the subject ( " one more july " )			0
here are the fundamental and immutable truths that escape many media analysts and others : when you watch an @entity35 game , you are observing angry young men smashing each other with all their might on every snap of the ball			0
and each generation of players is bigger , faster and stronger than the one before			1
@entity150 is not a contact sport			0
it is a collision sport			0
that is the essence -- indeed , the whole point -- of the game			0
college football is a petting zoo			1
the @entity35 is a jungle			0
when players cross the white lines in the @entity35 , they take on the persona of the gladiator			1
the intent is to destroy the opponent 's will , to dominate him , to beat him into submission			0
there are no nice guys on game day			0
some players can exit the field and resume life as decent human beings : kind , reverent and socially aware			2
their unresolved anger issues are too dominant and manifest in often dangerous ways			0
for these players and former players , there is no equivalent in civilian life to the catharsis of two hours a day of physical combat			2
the only people who understand a specific locker room are those who lived or live there			1
when i moved to @entity190 's team in @entity191 , for example , i was surprised to learn that there was much more laughter than in my previous locker room			1
the team motto was " if you ca n't take a joke , bleep you ! " only we did n't say " bleep			2
" everyone was fair game , especially superstars like @entity203			0
the great @entity204 literally stripped his britches off down to jock once , in the middle of practice with several hundred spectators , because @entity209 had planted a cicada in his pants			0
everyone laughed , including @entity204			0
@entity212 smiled but quickly restored order , reminding us that we had better execute if we wanted the fun to continue			2
if practice deteriorated , @entity212 stuck that jaw out , and our safety valve , @entity219 , would say , " cut the crap			0
" i really feel that @entity212 's phenomenal record was due in part to his ability to allow for some nonsense from time to time and because we had people like @entity228 , who became his surrogates in the huddle			0
there was only one @entity5 , and there is a reason the @entity120 trophy bears his name			1
there will never be another @entity212			0
every organization must have its own ethos and standards that are hammered into the men 's consciousness every day as the team 's complex mix changes with waivers , injuries and trades			2
players often feel that they are fighting for their lives			2
there must be constant reminders of the focus			2
when the team wins , everybody benefits			0
individual players with differences should be expected to take care of business in private or on the field -- like the men they claim to be .			2

@entity261 : @entity5 would n't tolerate racism in locker room ; culture set at the top
*dolphins* fired coach and trainer after bullying report ; he says it should n't have come to this
he says football is violent , intense , needs leaders to set firm standards for alpha males
