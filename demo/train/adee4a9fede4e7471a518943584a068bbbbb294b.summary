it 's not easy to squeeze 40 years of show into one anniversary special , but " @entity3 " gave it a go on sunday night			1
from the @entity6 / @entity5 opening to the return of @entity8 and musical performances by the likes of lightning rod artists @entity11 and @entity13 ( who offered a surprisingly charming version of " @entity15 " ) , it was an evening of mockery and fond remembrances for the " snl " 40th anniversary special			1
why ' @entity3 ' is still awesome here are some highlights : @entity6 and @entity5 get musical could @entity21 please just give these two their own show already ? we already knew that @entity24 and @entity5 are magical , thanks to their " @entity26 " skits on @entity24 's " @entity28			1
" on sunday night , they opened the special episode with a musical number celebrating some of the show 's most famous catchphrases			1
three cheers for @entity5 's @entity36 balls ! @entity37 makes out with @entity38 " the @entity40 " skit was already pretty awesome , with @entity41 and @entity42 joining cast members past and present ( @entity44 even showed up ! ) , but then 93 - year - old @entity37 locked lips with 40 - year - old @entity38			1
the return of @entity8 we wo n't say much about this one even though it was eagerly anticipated			2
after a 30 - year absence from " snl , " @entity8 returned for all of 73 seconds			2
introduced by @entity51 , the actor received a standing ovation and offered a few words including " i will always love this show , " and that was that			0
it was brief and awkward			0
welcome back , " @entity56 " @entity57 and @entity58 returned as the beloved characters @entity59 and @entity61 for an " @entity3 " @entity62			0
in announcing no. 6 -- musical guests -- @entity58 as @entity61 said , " i think @entity64 was one of the best , even better than @entity65			0
" that was the perfect segue into no. 5 : " @entity11 , sit down , " a reference to the artist 's recent lament that @entity64 should not have beat out @entity65 for best album at the 2015 @entity71			1
@entity11 was in the audience , and at one point we got to see him play along as security " restrained " him			2
way to have a sense of humor about it , @entity11			2
party on ! excellent ! celebrity " @entity81 ! " @entity82 as @entity83 is always at his best when paired with @entity85 's borderline - nsfw @entity84 , but this episode also gave us the delight that is @entity89 as @entity90 and @entity91 as @entity92			0
when the other " celebs " showed up , it was hard to keep it together			0
@entity97 's @entity96 was pretty spot - on .			0
