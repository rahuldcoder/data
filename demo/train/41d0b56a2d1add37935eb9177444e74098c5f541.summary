-- a potential terror plot may have involved synchronized attacks in several countries with " at least a dozen " people taking part , a law enforcement official said wednesday			1
earlier , a @entity8 counterterrorism source said that a man captured in @entity10 had tipped off investigators to a potential " @entity14 - style " plot in @entity13			1
@entity14 , the financial hub of @entity16 , was the site of a three - day terror attack two years ago that left more than 160 people dead			1
ten men launched the carefully planned assault , targeting prominent sites such as the @entity25 hotel , the @entity27 hotels , the historic @entity29 train station and a @entity31 cultural center			0
the intelligence gathered so far , the law enforcement official said , indicated that sites in the @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity8 as well as @entity37 and @entity38 may have been targets in the potential plot			1
investigators believe @entity44 leader @entity43 signed off on a @entity13 attack plan , a separate law enforcement source said			2
but @entity47 and international officials say they have seen no sign of an imminent attack			1
@entity47 officials said the alleged plot has no @entity47 component -- at least none that has been found			1
one official stressed that the plot is serious and credible but that the intelligence available lacked specificity : no who , where or how			0
some names of " known operational planners " are possibly connected with the plot , but there is " no precise insight " into who may be planning an attack , the official said			2
soft targets such as hotels and economic targets are of particular concern , but there is " no precise " intelligence on the mode of attack , said the official			0
another official said there are different threads coming from different places , and it 's not clear how or even if they will come together			0
the @entity13 countries involved -- primarily @entity8 , @entity36 and @entity35 -- are tackling the perceived threats as they see fit , the official said			1
the " threat has certainly caught our attention " and that of our allies , the official said			0
although no " @entity47 dimension " to the plot has been uncovered , the official said , the " @entity47 is only a seven - hour plane ride away " from @entity13			1
the potential plot is one reason for a dramatic increase in the number of missile strikes by unmanned drones against terrorist targets in @entity101 , according to a @entity47 official			1
the number of suspected @entity47 drone strikes in @entity101 jumped to 20 this month -- more than in any previous month and twice the monthly average , according to a @entity0 estimate based on information from @entity101 officials			2
a federal law enforcement official in the @entity47 , meanwhile , said " the volume seems to be turned up " on the threat information coming out of @entity13			1
the intelligence indicates there is interest in using people with @entity118 passports in an attack , that official said			0
the official said the potential operatives may be a mix of @entity13 and others , possibly including @entity124 , @entity101 , @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127			2
there is concern about an " active shooter " scenario that would create as many casualties and as much chaos as possible in a short period of time			0
the @entity14 attacks showed how effective this kind of an attack can be in drawing attention			1
@entity140 evacuated after bomb threat economic institutions in @entity13 , including banks and stock exchanges , could be possible targets , according to the federal law enforcement source			0
the man who described a potential attack , @entity148 , was detained in @entity150 , @entity10 , in july and transferred to @entity47 custody , the @entity8 official said			1
@entity148 , a @entity8 of @entity10 descent , attended the same @entity155 mosque as @entity156 -- a leader of the september 11 attacks on the @entity47 -- and was part of @entity156 's circle , the official said			1
the man in custody has " revealed details about the terror plot , " said the official , who did not want to be named because he is not authorized to talk to the media			2
@entity8 's @entity166 said wednesday that authorities are aware of recent published reports about planned terror attacks in @entity13 and are analyzing the intelligence information			1
" presently this has produced no concrete indications of directly imminent attacks in @entity8			1
the current accounts do not lead to a change in [ our ] assessment of danger , " the ministry said			0
@entity179 , the @entity47 secretary of homeland security , declined to say wednesday whether there was concrete information about a plan to attack the @entity47			1
" there are constantly threats of all types that we need to be able to be proactive against , and be proactive even when there are n't specific threats , " she told @entity0 's " @entity189			0
" @entity148 , the man who was captured , traveled with several other @entity8 from @entity155 , @entity8 , to the @entity10 - @entity101 border area in 2009 , where he joined the @entity194 , an extremist group allied with @entity44 , @entity8 intelligence officials said			1
one he was captured , @entity148 " started to talk a lot " and detailed a " @entity14 - style " attack in @entity13 , the @entity8 official said			1
@entity148 is from @entity155 , where he worked for a cleaning company at the @entity155 international airport , the @entity8 official said			1
he attended the @entity200 mosque , formerly known as the @entity202 mosque , in @entity155 , which became known as the meeting place of those behind the september 11 attacks			1
@entity155 shut down the mosque this year , not long after @entity148 's capture			2
@entity47 national intelligence director @entity208 would not talk about a plot tuesday evening			2
" we are not going to comment on specific intelligence , as doing so threatens to undermine intelligence operations that are critical to protecting the @entity47 and our allies , " he said			0
" as we have repeatedly said , we know @entity44 wants to attack @entity13 and the @entity47			1
" the @entity8 government is increasingly concerned about the number of @entity8 becoming jihadists			0
according to a senior @entity8 counterterrorism source , about 200 individuals have traveled to train with jihadist groups in the @entity10 - @entity101 border region since the september 11 attacks			1
the potential plot against @entity13 is apparently one reason for the increase in attacks by unmanned aerial drones in @entity101			2
" we would be remiss not to try to take action to thwart what might be underway in @entity13 , " the official said , though the official emphasized it was not the sole factor			2
@entity47 officials say they are taking advantage of what they call " precise intelligence			1
" most of the drone attacks this year have been focused on @entity239 , a mountainous area bordering @entity10 where @entity101 security forces have little control			2
that has continued to be the pattern this month			0
@entity244 declined to comment on the increase in drone attacks			0
but acknowledging the spike , one @entity47 official said : " our operational tempo has been up for a while now , we have good information driving it , and given the stakes involved , we hope to keep the pressure on as long as we can			2
" according to the official , the mix of threats remains the same			0
it comes from groups like the @entity259 , @entity44 , the @entity10 @entity260 and the @entity101 @entity260			0
the threats they pose are " all deadly , " said the official			0
@entity101 officials say many recent strikes have been aimed at compounds in or around the town of @entity268 , a stronghold of the @entity259			0
western intelligence officials have long regarded the @entity259 as one of the most dangerous terror groups and have linked them to several attacks in @entity150			0
intelligence analysts point to other reasons for the escalated drone attacks			0
those include better information from sources in the border area and better surveillance technology , including the growing use of spy balloons fitted with high - powered cameras			0
in addition , the rising number of drone strikes is designed to deprive the @entity260 of " strategic depth , " as the @entity289 administration 's campaign to defeat the insurgency enters a crucial phase , and to tighten the noose on the senior @entity44 leadership			0
@entity101 officials say one strike last weekend killed sheikh @entity295 , described as the group 's senior operational commander			0
@entity0 's @entity298 , @entity299 and @entity300 contributed to this report .			0
