-- for the past 20 years , a large @entity2 poster advertising the band 's first tour of @entity5 has been hanging in @entity7 's living room			1
" every time i have to go to the bathroom i have to walk past it , " says the former @entity2 drummer			2
" i 'd always see it and say to myself , ' one day we 're gon na reunite ! we 're gon na do it ! we 're too good of a team not to do this again			1
' " when he returned to @entity18 this past april after @entity20 's no - show at the @entity22 induction ceremony , @entity7 's attitude started to change			1
" now i walk past it and i say to myself , ' i 'm so glad i was a part of that , ' " he says			1
" ' that was a great and exciting time of my life			2
' it 's nice to appreciate it , but i 'm no longer angry and pining for a reunion			1
i 'm not angry about it anymore			1
it 's flushed out of my system			2
" right around the time it was becoming clear that @entity2 were n't going to reform at the @entity22 , @entity7 broke up his band @entity36			1
they had spent the past decade touring the world playing a set devoted to @entity2 classics			2
" i told the guys i wanted to do something that was relevant , " he says			2
" we played every village around the world			2
i 'm not talking cities or towns			2
it was time to move on			2
" @entity36 played their final gig on @entity51 , and just weeks later , @entity7 began jamming with singer @entity52 , guitarist @entity53 and bassist @entity54			1
" it was like @entity56 brought them to me , " says @entity7			1
" it 's just been f * * * ing magic			2
" the new group dubbed themselves @entity7 , and they cut their debut lp , @entity63 , in a matter of weeks			1
@entity65 : @entity7 shares joy on ' @entity63 ' @entity67 came into the studio at one point to play guitar on " just do n't ask			1
" " for me to be a part of @entity67 's life , i had to get my life together , " says @entity7			1
" @entity67 was proud of me for how i was able to take care of myself			0
it was so nice to be living in the present with him			0
the whole thing was like a dream come true			0
" @entity7 says he 's been sober since 2008			1
" i work at it every day , " he explains			0
" i used to wake up in the morning and say , ' oh , @entity56			0
' now i wake up in the morning and look forward to life			2
i work out every morning with my guitarist			0
" as viewers of @entity87 's " @entity86 " and " @entity88 " well know , @entity7 's road to recovery was extremely rocky			1
many have criticized the dr. @entity91 show for being exploitative and , in the wake of the deaths of participants @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 , wondered whether it should be pulled off the air			0
@entity7 has no such feelings			1
" it was the best thing i ever did for myself , " he says			0
" having the treatment on tv made it easier because the camera does n't lie			0
you try to bulls * * t your way out of things , but then you watch yourself on camera and you see the truth			0
when you 're doing drugs you think you 're 10 feet tall and beautiful			0
but you ca n't be in denial when there 's a video camera in your face			0
" for now , @entity7 is focused entirely on his new band 's first tour			1
they plan on spending much of the next year playing around the entire globe , and their set will consist almost entirely of new material			0
" out of respect for the fans , we will probably do two @entity2 songs , " he says			0
" we 'll probably do ' @entity128 ' and ' mr. @entity129			0
' but beyond that it 's all about this band , though in certain countries we 're gon na have to play more than two			2
we 're going to do some dates with @entity135 's band loaded in @entity136 , but i do n't think i 'm supposed to talk about that yet			1
" after the @entity22 ceremony , @entity7 voiced tremendous frustration with @entity20 , calling him an " a * * hole " and pledged never to talk about him in public again			1
now , he says , " i 'm not angry with @entity20 anymore			1
i love him and i feel blessed that i got to work with him and achieve what i achieved with him			0
i guess time does heal all wounds			0
" @entity7 also regrets labeling the current lineup of @entity2 " scabs			1
" " i should n't have said that , " he says			0
" i 've grown up and matured			0
holy crap ! i 've matured in the six months since we last spoke ! " see original story at @entity0			0
