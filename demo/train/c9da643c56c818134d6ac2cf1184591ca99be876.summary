@entity0 -- the doctor convicted in @entity4 's death sees the jury 's verdict in a wrongful death civil trial as " justice			1
" " i cried because , for once , the world was allowed to hear some of the facts at they pertain to this matter -- a lot of facts that have been suppressed , much of which i was denied and my attorneys could not present during my criminal trial , " dr. @entity10 said on @entity11 's " today " on thursday			1
he described himself as " relieved			0
" a jury found wednesday that concert promoter @entity22 was not liable in @entity4 's death			1
the jury found that @entity22 had hired @entity10 , but that @entity10 was competent			1
" the jury 's decision completely vindicates @entity22 , confirming what we have known from the start -- that although @entity4 's death was a terrible tragedy , it was not a tragedy of @entity22 's making , " @entity22 attorney @entity25 said			1
the jury rejected @entity25 's contention that @entity22 did not hire @entity10 , but the conclusion that the doctor was not " unfit or incompetent " got the company off the hook for a potential billion dollar judgment			1
the decision ended a five - month trial , but likely began a years - long appeal process			0
it will not help @entity10 's appeal on his criminal conviction , however			1
and the jury foreman disputed suggestions by @entity10 's legal team that the verdict supports his case			1
the foreman added that he would not want @entity10 treating him			1
@entity4 lawyer : ' we found the truth ' " @entity22 has denied for years , and continues to deny , that they hired dr. @entity10 , " @entity58 's lawyers said in a statement released late wednesday			1
" the jury found unanimously that @entity22 hired dr. @entity10			1
@entity22 has repeated the mantra that this lawsuit was a shakedown			0
such a statement is a slap in the face of the entire judicial system that allowed this case to get to a jury			1
" while the verdict means no money in damages for the @entity75 , the statement suggested they believe they gained something from the trial			0
" we have said from the beginning that this case was a search for the truth , " it said			1
" we found the truth			0
@entity22 hired dr. @entity10 , the man who is in jail for killing @entity4			1
" @entity4 lawyers , who were discussing the grounds for an appeal even before the verdict was read , indicated the legal fight is not over			2
" all options regarding the balance of the jury verdict are being considered , " their statement said			0
@entity58 , 83 , sat with nephew @entity96 and a lawyer for the reading of the verdict in a large @entity0 courtroom wednesday			0
she played a word game on her @entity102 while sitting on a hallway bench to pass the time before the reading			0
none of her sons , daughters or grandchildren attended court wednesday			0
jurors became @entity4 fans testimony by 58 witnesses over 83 days included intimate revelations by those closest to the singer -- pulling back the curtain on @entity4 's dreams , passions , pain and fears			1
it shed light into his intractable insomnia that led to @entity4 's death from an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol just days before the planned premiere of his comeback concert			2
contrary to some expectations that the trial would damage @entity4 's reputation with its focus on his drug abuse , jury foreman @entity130 said thursday that what he saw and heard made him a bigger fan of the @entity4 he bought some of @entity4 's albums growing up , but it was n't until serving as a juror in the wrongful death trial that he realized his talent , generosity and personality , @entity130 said			1
@entity130 -- a high school football coach -- said he came close to crying in court when @entity4 lawyers played a video of @entity4 's children as he sang " @entity149 , " a song he wrote to describe his love for his children			1
" @entity156 " show director @entity153 also won new fans from the jury			2
@entity130 said jurors believed @entity153 was " absolutely truthful " in his testimony about @entity4 's deteriorated condition a week before he died , but his " miraculous " recovery at his last two rehearsals			2
" he got emotional a couple of times and had to walk off the stand , we really felt bad for him , but he was also a man who put in so much work and so much effort and did everything he could , we felt , to try to help @entity4 , " @entity130 said			2
several jurors , including @entity130 , applauded at the end of @entity153 's dramatic testimony			0
" it was just the absolute honesty of what he was doing , " @entity130 said			0
" all of the sudden the jurors sitting there for all those months , we watched all these other guys get up there and we were asking ' is that the truth or is that a lie ? ' now all of a sudden we did n't have to do that			2
we could just relax and listen because everything he said was the truth			0
that 's why he got applauded			0
" fit and competent , but unethical ? @entity130 suggested jurors were boxed in by the wording of the second question on their verdict form : " was dr. @entity10 unfit or incompetent to perform the work for which he was hired ? " jurors interpreted " the work " to be as a " general practitioner " who was expected to treat @entity4 and his children for routine illnesses -- not to infuse him with profopol to put him to sleep every night , @entity130 said			1
" @entity10 had a license , he graduated from an accredited college and we felt he was competent to do the job of being a general practitioner , " @entity130 said			2
" now , that does n't mean that we felt he was ethical , and maybe had the word ethical been in the question , it could have been a different outcome			0
but because it was for the job he was hired to do , that was what we had to focus on			0
" @entity4 lawyers argued that one reason @entity10 was unfit was because he had a conflict of interest			1
his deep financial debt made him conflicted to the point that he took dangerous risks with his patient because he feared losing the $ 150,000 monthly salary that @entity22 agreed to pay him to treat @entity4 , they argued			2
jurors apparently did not see medical ethics as an essential element for a fit and competent physician			0
@entity226 's @entity225 asked @entity130 if he believed @entity10 was unethical			2
" you betcha ! " he answered			0
" because he went way beyond what he was supposed to do			0
" juror : @entity22 was ' in the dark ' interviews with @entity130 and another juror indicate that even if they had decided @entity10 was unfit and incompetent , the jury still might not have held @entity22 responsible for the doctor giving @entity4 the dangerous nightly infusions of propofol that eventually killed him			1
" there was not one shred of evidence presented over five months to back up the fact that @entity22 could have known that dr. @entity10 was doing that , " @entity130 said			1
" if @entity22 had known what was going on behind closed doors , it probably would have made a world of difference , but they did n't , " @entity243 said			2
@entity22 lawyers were apparently effective with their strategy of calling several of @entity4 's former doctors to testify about how the singer developed close friendships with them			2
@entity4 was talented at " doctor shopping " and keeping his various physicians in the dark about each other , they argued			2
" @entity4 was pretty used to getting his own way , " @entity243 said			2
" he was a big star			0
he had all these doctors who wanted to be his doctor and he could pretty much get what he wanted			0
if anybody said ' no , ' well , they were out of the mix and he 'd find somebody else			0
" @entity10 treated @entity4 in an upstairs bedroom at his mansion , where no one else could see , @entity243 said			1
" how could @entity22 have done anything about it when they were kept in the dark ? " @entity10 's lawyer : ' this is huge ' no one seemed more surprised in courtroom when the verdict was read than @entity10 's lawyers			1
@entity281 , who had sat in on much of the trial so she could give personal reports to her jailed client , let out an audible gasp when the court clerk read the jury 's " no " to the question " was dr. @entity10 unfit or incompetent to perform the work for which he was hired ? " @entity10 was " very , very emotional " when @entity281 visited him in jail to discuss the verdict wednesday evening , @entity281 said			1
the civil trial verdict has no impact on @entity10 's criminal appeal , " but in the court of public opinion , this is huge , " @entity281 told @entity1			1
@entity10 , who is appealing his involuntary manslaughter conviction , is scheduled to be released from jail this month after serving two years of a four - year sentence			2
his medical licenses were suspended after his conviction two years ago , but he could regain them , @entity281 said " he has a lot of patients who really want him to come back and practice , " she said			0
" and we 'll see			0
" on @entity11 , @entity10 said , " i will restart my life and , @entity307 willing , i will be a model to show the world that despite adversity , and when bad things happen to good people , they can restart their life and succeed			1
the jury foreman bristled at the suggestion that @entity10 was vindicated by his verdict			1
" absolutely not , " @entity130 said			0
" i do n't see it as a vindication of dr. @entity10 , and no , i would not hire him as my doctor			1
it 's not a vindication			0
again , it 's the way the question was worded			0
" asked by @entity11 whether he felt vindicated , @entity10 said the verdict showed him that " you have to wait on the @entity329			0
you just have to know that he is there for you , and he is going to deliver his justice on his time			0
" @entity1 's @entity333 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity4 won a new fan during trial -- the jury foreman
jury foreman : " i do n't see it as a vindication of dr. @entity10 "
" for once , the world was allowed to hear some of the facts , " dr. @entity10 says
