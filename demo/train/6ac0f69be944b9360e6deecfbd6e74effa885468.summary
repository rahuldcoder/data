" @entity10 : how does @entity35 finally home work ? @entity1 : @entity4 helps to give wounded troops returning from @entity3 and @entity37 a mortgage - free home			1
it really changes lives , and it gives people hope			2
a lot of times , one of the biggest things for our troops is getting jobs			2

i know the emotional void and the mental struggles and the physical struggles that the men and women and the families go through when they 're recovering			1
so it allows me to understand the importance of it , and it gives me the opportunity to serve			0
@entity10 : what other projects are you working on ? @entity1 : i 'm involved with " @entity12 " at the moment , and it 's an exciting ride			1
it 's fun , and it 's a great platform for me to share who i am with people			0
