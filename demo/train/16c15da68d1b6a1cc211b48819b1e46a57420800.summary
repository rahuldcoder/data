-- @entity2 bosses are under increasing pressure to review their decision to stage the @entity5 later this month			1
a @entity7 politician added his voice to the growing chorus of dissent on friday saying motorsport officials should " rethink " their plans			1
" in hindsight , the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) should not have scheduled the 2012 race so early in the season , " said @entity13 , a @entity14 member of parliament			1
" it was always going to be too early to know how far things had moved on in @entity21 since last year			1
@entity2 ca n't turn the clock back but , with three weeks to go before the race , it can still rethink			1
it should do so , " he added			0
" in a context where genuine and sustainable reform is taking place , holding a @entity5 could be a unifying event for the people of @entity21 as well as a positive showcase on the world stage			1
but things are not at that stage			0
" the calls come amid continuing unrest in the country with demonstrators and @entity21 authorities continuing to clash			2
@entity13 's words echo those made by former @entity7 @entity2 world champion @entity43 on thursday , who said running the race now could create more problems than it solves			1
" it would be a bad state of affairs , and bad for @entity2 , to be seen to be enforcing martial law in order to hold the race			2
that is not what this sport should be about , " @entity43 said			1
most recently , @entity21 officials have arrested the daughter of the human rights activist @entity58 who is currently on hunger strike to protest the life sentence he received for his alleged role in the ongoing unrest			2
in february , the country 's @entity2 organizers , the @entity63 ( @entity64 ) insisted the race would go ahead			2
but @entity68 , the president of the @entity69 ( a group started by @entity58 ) urged officials to reverse the decision			2
" if @entity2 go ahead with the race it will give the impression that everything is back to normal when everything is not back to normal			0
people are dying on a daily basis , @entity68 told @entity0			0
" i say think of the human rights , think of things other than just your profit and your interest			0
human rights have to come first , " he added			0
" we will welcome you back when everything is back to normal , when the killing and arrests have stopped in the streets			0
" however , the @entity64 insisted that the race would be safe			0
" the @entity64 is in regular contact with the @entity15 , @entity94 ( @entity94 ) and the @entity21 government , " it said in a statement			0
" all of the above continue to state that the grand prix goes ahead , and we are therefore going about our business of ensuring that this sporting event can be enjoyed by a hundred thousand local spectators , as well as hundreds of millions of viewers around the world			1
we speak to @entity2 teams regularly , and have received no communication regarding an unwillingness to race			0
" with particular reference to travel advice , @entity21 has had a ' green ' travel alert ( i.e. no travel restrictions ) from the @entity7 @entity110 for some months now			1
this rating is safer than even the first race in 2004			0
