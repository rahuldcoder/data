-- sanctions against @entity2 are illegal and are undermining international law , @entity2 president @entity1 said in an exclusive , wide - ranging interview with @entity0 's @entity6			1
" when it comes to sanctions , have they been successful so far ? sanctions first and foremost are illegal , " he told @entity6 on wednesday on the sidelines of the annual @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13			2
" and a @entity15 which claims to be making laws should not contravene international laws			1
" " these sanctions translate into the weakening of the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) , the weakening of international laws and regulations			2
no other country can decide for another country			1
" @entity1 's comments follow the announcement of a bipartisan proposal in the @entity15 calling for new @entity30 sanctions , with implementation delayed to allow negotiations to continue			1
a senior @entity34 aide told @entity0 this month that an informal count for the move had surpassed 75 votes -- more than enough for the @entity34 to override the presidential veto that @entity39 has pledged would follow any such measure			2
" we are not afraid of threats , " @entity1 said			1
" and the language of threats is ineffective when it comes to @entity2			2
the language they need to choose should be a legal one , a respectful tone of voice when addressing the @entity2 people			2
... it benefits our region and the interests of other countries			0
" suspicions about the @entity30 the @entity2 president suggested mistrust of the @entity30 is deep - rooted , adding that " with regards to the policies of various @entity30 administrations in the past 30 years , " the @entity2 public is " very worried			1
... they do n't trust them			1
" still , @entity1 said there is " full readiness " on the part of @entity2 " to take the final step " on the nuclear issue			1
asked about president @entity39 's recent comment that he thought there was a no more than a 50 - 50 chance of completing a comprehensive agreement with @entity2 , rather than just the interim deal that was signed in november , @entity1 said that though the last step would be more difficult than the first , " the conditions allow us to take the final step			1
" on monday , the @entity79 said it was " pleased " to note that the implementation of the @entity81 had begun , including the halting of production of uranium enriched to 20 %			0
it said the moves were " an important development			0
" according to the @entity30 , under the deal , @entity2 must eliminate its stockpile of uranium that 's enriched to higher levels , dismantle some of the infrastructure that makes enrichment possible , and allow a broader and more intrusive set of inspections of its nuclear programs			1
however , @entity1 insisted that @entity2 still had a right to peaceful nuclear technology , including enrichment , which he described as " part and parcel of the inalienable rights of states			1
" " it is part a part of our national pride , and nuclear technology has become indigenous , " he said			0
" and recently , we have managed to secure very considerable prowess with regards to the fabrication of centrifuges , " he added , explaining that " not under any circumstances " would @entity2 destroy any of its existing centrifuges			2
minister : @entity30 mischaracterized deal @entity1 's comments on the country 's centrifuges came the same day as remarks by @entity2 foreign minister @entity120 suggesting that the @entity39 administration had mischaracterized @entity2 concessions			1
speaking to @entity0 chief national security correspondent @entity123 , @entity120 said : " the @entity125 version both underplays the concessions and overplays @entity2 commitments			2
" he also reiterated @entity1 's insistence that @entity2 will not be dismantling its centrifuges			1
" in the context of r&d and peaceful nuclear technology , we will not accept any limitations , " @entity1 told @entity6 , arguing that @entity2 's need for medical isotopes necessitated a heavy water reactor			1
critics worry that the @entity139 heavy water reactor could be used to produce plutonium , which has the potential to be used in a nuclear weapon			0
but @entity1 insisted it would be used for " nuclear medicine , " not nuclear weapons			1
" we are standing on our own two feet			0
@entity2 scientists have designed this			2
so when it comes to medical concerns , we can not accept limitations			0
" @entity1 also dismissed the possibility that @entity154 , which has been strongly critical of the agreement with @entity2 , would attempt a military strike against its nuclear facilities			1
" @entity154 knows very well what the response would be			0
@entity154 knows well our regional capability , " he said			0
" when it comes to practice , the @entity154 can not do that			0
if they do such a crazy thing , our response will make them rue the day			0
" @entity2 and @entity166 @entity1 was in @entity12 even as , on the other side of the country , talks continued on how to bring an end to @entity166 's civil war			1
@entity2 was invited to participate sunday , but the invitation was rescinded after @entity166 's main opposition @entity173 threatened to boycott the talks			2
but while agreeing that other countries should come together to try to stop the conflict , @entity1 said elections were the key to resolving the issue			1
" the @entity181 government has been there for some years now			0
it has been running the county for some years now , " he said			0
" and if the people have some grievances , they need to go through legal channels , engage in free elections , for everyone to find out what the people need			0
" " all of us should ... work together to bring about appropriate conditions inside @entity166 and help with elections			0
everyone should respect the vote of the @entity166			0
whatever the @entity166 say , that should be enough			0
if outside countries want to decide for @entity166 , they are wrong			0

" no other country can decide for another country , " @entity2 president says
he says the @entity2 public is " very worried . ... they do n't trust " the @entity30
still , @entity1 says , @entity2 is ready " to take the final step " on the nuclear issue
