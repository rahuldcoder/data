@entity0 , @entity1 -- there is a predictable pattern that ensues following any tragic news in @entity1			1
there is at first a collective sense of shock and grief			2
there follows official visits to the scene of the tragedy			0
families are condoled and money is doled out in compensation			0
a period of mourning is inevitably announced			0
in a country where nothing happens quickly , committees and investigative panels will then be set up with remarkable alacrity			2
the result is always the same			0
rhetoric , followed by vacuous proclamations but ultimately , inaction			0
the banal sequence has already begun playing out with news of sunday 's fatal air crash in @entity32 which claimed over 150 lives			2
this time , however , @entity1 are demanding answers			1
accidents do happen of course but the memories of january 's mass protests are fresh and there lingers a suspicion of government negligence			2
it is far too early to determine the outcome of the crash but early indications are that this was an entirely avoidable disaster			0
see also : @entity1 no longer ' suffering and smiling ' the investigation must begin with @entity47 , operators of the ill fated @entity48			1
the irony is that the @entity51 - owned airline has quite a decent track record since they began operations in @entity1 four years ago			1
with a modest number of four aircraft in its fleet , the airline had grown at a reasonable pace and had just taken delivery of another @entity48 in may			1
a strong focus on domestic services and competitive fares had seen @entity47 become the airline of choice for many regular fliers			1
there were signs , however , in the last six months that standards had begun to slip			1
first came the irregular take - off times			2
@entity71 flights , once paragons of punctuality , started taking off late or sometimes not at all			0
the delays were quite often without reason			0
on 15 may this year , i waited with other passengers for over six hours to board as engineers addressed a mechanical problem on one of its planes			0
on a separate occasion , we were to board the last @entity84 out of @entity32 to @entity0			0
the flight was canceled and no explanation given			0
there was no offer of compensation either			0
@entity47 has also faced accusations of penny - pinching			1
even before sunday 's crash , there had been suggestions that @entity71 's four aircraft were being overworked			1
see also : @entity97 images from @entity32 on sunday alone , the aircraft with registration number @entity99 was already on its fourth trip of the day and scheduled to make another one			2
in may , the same aircraft had to make two unscheduled air returns following reports of engine failure , according to a @entity47 station manager in @entity32			1
whatever the outcome of the investigation , the omens are not good for @entity47			1
no @entity1 airline has ever fully recovered from an air disaster			1
@entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 were all @entity1 airlines with decent sized fleets and considerable goodwill just ten years ago			1
their names all became obsolete pretty quickly following a spate of crashes between 2002 and 2006			0
the government has taken the step of withdrawing their operational license and ground @entity71 aircraft whilst an inquiry takes place			2
even in the event of continued operations , there would have been a likely slump in passenger bookings which will harm the airline			2
the investigation must go beyond @entity71 and extend to the @entity135 ( @entity135 )			1
the main regulator of the country 's airline industry will need to face some tough questions as well			1
did they do enough to minimize the chance of such a crash ? the @entity47 was 22 years old , which is not exactly ancient in aviation terms but given that @entity1 law prohibits aircraft over the age of 20 from operating , who fell asleep at the switch ? besides at that age , any aircraft would require maintenance checks to be as regular as they are vigorous			1
separate eyewitness accounts of leaking hydraulics on the @entity48 do not suggest that this was the case			0
this time around the @entity1 public is in no mood for obfuscation or cover - ups			1
the last major air incident in @entity1 was in october 2006 when an @entity116 airlines flight crashed near @entity0 and killed 96 on board			2
the outcome of the subsequent investigation was never revealed but now there is a growing demand that such information is shared with the public			0
following that crash , the government grounded all commercial aircraft and revoked the licenses of many			2
air worthiness became a paramount issue and as a result the slack operators were forced to tighten up			0
those that could not shape up exited the scene			0
on that occasion it took over 500 deaths in five years to shake the government into action			0
if laxity has started to creep back into @entity1 's aviation sector , one hopes that it will not take a similar rash of incidents to ensure that safety standards are being consistently met			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .			0

@entity193 says there were signs that @entity47 standards had slipped in the last six months
the airline faces accusations of penny - pinching and aircraft overuse
@entity1 @entity135 , the country 's airline industry regulator must be questioned too
