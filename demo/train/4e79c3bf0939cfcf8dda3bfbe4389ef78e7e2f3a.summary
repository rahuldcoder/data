-- imagine stepping onto a cold , windy platform at 2 in the morning and waiting just a few seconds for the transit car to show up			2
imagine getting in the car and zipping right by stations as you go directly to your destination			2
imagine always having a seat on the train			2
believe it or not , you 're imagining a concept that 's more than 50 years old , but still very rare in the real world			2
it 's called personal rapid transit			1
the cars -- designed to seat four to six people -- would move along a guideway , with their positions aided by embedded magnets or lasers			1
other @entity23 systems have wheels running along sidewalls that help steer each pod car			1
see images of @entity28 they would merge into traffic and often closely follow the car in front of them			0
but there would be no traffic lights -- and no drivers			0
" it 's like an automated taxi that runs on its own roadway and does n't have to stop , " said @entity37 , president of @entity38 , a @entity39 - based company that works with cities and agencies to study personal rapid transit feasibility			1
" it does tend to make sense in more congested areas ( like big metropolitan areas ) , but we have also developed concepts for car - free cities			2
" there is no @entity23 system operating in the @entity55			1
there is a new one at @entity58 in @entity59 and one in the @entity62 district of @entity63 in the @entity64			0
watch @entity23 in action in @entity62 there is a people mover at @entity68 , but the cars on the 8.2 mile - line have room for 20 and during peak periods stop at all five stations			1
advocates like @entity75 in @entity76 say that one of the big plusses for @entity23 would be job creation			1
while his group entered into the investigation of this form of transit from an environmental standpoint and looking to ease urban sprawl , they soon realized there are just a handful of companies in the business that build the cars and tracks			1
three of the major players -- 2getthere , @entity93 and @entity94 -- are foreign - owned and hope to build plants in the @entity55			1
" you 're really talking about a brand new industry , " he said			0
@entity98 said the region he lives in , @entity100 , really needs an economic boost that manufacturing could help			0
there are many factories in his area that sit unused , he said			0
" there 's been a lot of discussion over the past few years ( with regional stakeholders ) about turning the corner into the new green economy , and using green technology and retooling , " he said			0
several cities in the @entity55 are looking into @entity23 as a possible way to complement their current transportation system			1
@entity119 's study , given to the state of @entity76 in september , proposed a 9 - mile track connecting the city core and two universities with 350 cars and 26 stations			2
the estimated cost was between $ 150 million and $ 168 million , not including design fees			0
" when you throw a number like that out there the average person says , ' we ca n't afford that , ' " @entity98 said			0
" but look at a city like @entity135 that is spending hundreds of millions a mile on ( its train system )			0
so this is fraction of the cost of light - or heavy - rail and it provides a solution that those kinds of systems do n't deliver			0
" unlike most transit systems , operating costs can be recouped at the fare box , @entity37 added			2
@entity148 , a professor at the @entity149 , disputed that , saying not enough people use transit because it is still cheaper for most to drive a car			1
and autos have a role in getting people around			2
" modern transportation is designed as intermodal , " said @entity148 , who has written a trilogy of books on public transportation			2
" it combines use of private car and bus and light - rail and rapid transit and does not forget pedestrians			1
" there is no single answer to the issues of our daily travels , he said			0
" people like to think there will be some vehicle that will come and that will solve everything , " he said			2
" it 's a naive concept			1
" @entity148 said there wo n't be enough people to use @entity23 in the suburbs to make it profitable and in the packed downtown areas , there will be a need for bigger vehicles that could seat " 30 , 40 or even 80 people " whereas @entity23 would be difficult to use			1
those systems already exist and are in use , he said			0
@entity191 , @entity192 , is another @entity55 city seriously studying @entity23 as part of its transportation future			1
originally the city was considering an automated people mover to run on a track between the airport and a proposed train station			2
but that was $ 600 million			0
then a company approached city officials saying they wanted to use @entity191 as a test market for group rapid transit			1
but that company backed out of its offer to build it for free , so @entity191 went looking at other modes of transit and discovered @entity23			1
" we came to the conclusion that this could be very promising , but it is very new technology , " said @entity208 , sustainability officer for the @entity191 @entity209			1
" we need an evaluation that is really robust , that evaluates the readiness of the technology and the ability of the companies to deliver and really do what we need to have done			0
" studies done in other cities have assumed the technology works , and the primary discussion points have been cost and where to locate , she said			0
@entity191 is taking a close look at whether it is worth the risk for a short first track that can be expanded later			1
" we think in the end we 'll end up with some good information and help the industry move forward in the @entity55 , " she said			1
she pointed out that when a city orders a bus or puts in light - rail , it can look at data from other systems to know what it is getting			0
with @entity23 , there 's nothing but dreams and a few test tracks			1
still , like advocates @entity98 and @entity37 , @entity208 can foresee a role for the pod car			0
" i think what @entity23 can be is the glue that makes existing transit systems work more effectively , " she said			1
she cited an example where a bus line was cut because it did n't make sense with only a handful of passengers on each bus			0
" here 's where @entity23 could fit in , " she said			1
@entity148 , on the other hand , said the problem with the nation 's transportation woes is not need for new technology , rather the need for better planning and policy			0
policymakers need to consider @entity23 , said @entity98			1
it 's a question of which @entity55 city is going to be first			2
" who is going to have the political will to say i want this done on my watch , " he said			0
" there are n't a lot of communities racing to be the one to take the biggest risk			0
so there are a lot of cities that are willing to be no. 2			0
" no. 1 ? it 's a tough sell			0

personal rapid transit cars seat four to six people and go directly to their destinations
advocates say they could ease congestion , tame urban sprawl , get people out of their cars
*critic* says @entity23 is a naive concept , other modes of transportation are better
@entity191 is one of the @entity55 cities seriously considering @entity23
