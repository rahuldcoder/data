@entity0 , @entity1 -- early morning in a soon - to - be sun - baked cactus garden in @entity0 , @entity1 ; as most life yawns into movement , one creature is already darting between the bright red cactus flowers in a blur of electric speed			0
a three - inch - long @entity10 hovers -- bristling among cactus spines , drinking nectar -- before breaking backwards , rising effortlessly over a gust of wind , and diving down out of sight			0
for the @entity18 students covertly watching , each move is executed quicker than a blinking eye			2
but when they take their high - speed video camera back to the lab and slow down their footage to a snail 's pace , the bird 's blurred motion becomes clear and the researchers get the information they came for : elusive clues to the secret of the hummingbird 's flight			1
natural inspiration miniature flying robots have come a long way in the last few years , now mastering incredible athletic feats			1
but when it comes to dealing with the unpredictable world around them , our best man - made flying machines still have a long way to go to match nature 's impressive creations			0
and that 's why , to create new flying robots that work in the world outside the lab , these pioneering researchers are looking to birds			1
" i study how birds fly and i use it as an inspiration for developing new robots , " says @entity53 , assistant professor of mechanical engineering at @entity18			1
" small micro air vehicles that can fly close to buildings or in cluttered environments or through turbulence , they actually encounter the exact same problems that birds have encountered for millions of years and solved , " he adds			0
how to fly to build the next generation of micro air vehicles , @entity53 aims to understand how a bird powers its agile maneuvers , and why a pair of flapping wings gives a bird the power to ease through turbulent skies			1
but the team is currently being held back by our lack of crucial knowledge			0
" we know very little , " says @entity79 , a graduate student in @entity18 's @entity80 " we do n't know how much force they generate at what part of the wing stroke			2
we ca n't explain all of the forces they are generating and we do n't know how they move their wings exactly -- so this is something we are starting to look at now			0
" the video of a hummingbird that @entity53 's team captured in the garden was filmed at more than 2,000 frames per second , allowing it to be played back in highly detailed super slow motion			1
at this speed , some remarkable secrets of the bird 's flight were revealed			1
they observed the hummingbird hovering , reversing and diving , and documented its unique " insect - like " wing action ( at 42 flaps a second )			0
they have also seen the tiny 3 - gram bird shake its body like a dog ( for reasons that are still unknown ) and detailed its tactic for facing down a wayward gust of wind			0
" we have this one shot of a bird -- it does n't actually do a full flap downwards -- it does half a flap and then goes back up , " explains @entity113 , another graduate student in the lab. " it is things like that that help stabilize it in the air and help it move really nimbly			0
" watch : flying robots ' aerial acrobatics it 's not just cameras that are revealing the secrets of bird flight			1
@entity79 has been training a miniature parrot ( called a parrotlet ) to fly between perches			0
laser systems monitor the flow of the air behind the bird -- showing a pair of swirling vortices behind the wings -- which could provide more clues to how the bird manages to be nimble as well as robust			2
building a ' robobird ' the team is putting this knowledge into practice by developing micro air vehicles powered by flapping wings			2
graduate student @entity150 is working on a prototype that can morph its wings while flying -- and she 's confident she can get it to rival the hummingbird 's 42 flaps per second			1
built from carbon fiber and mylar , the device weighs just over 20 grams and by folding its wings it can reduce its wingspan from 44 cm to about 16 cm. the aim is to build " a more maneuverable flapping - wing air vehicle , able to fly through gaps smaller than its wing span without breaking itself , " @entity150 explains			2
the team admits it could take decades to produce a robot capable of equaling the subtleties of a real bird 's swoops and dives			1
but for @entity53 , learning more about bird flight inspires admiration of the " extraordinary " creatures			1
" ( a bird ) is such a complicated machine , " he says			0
" if you look at the amount of processing power in its brain , its actuation capabilities -- just all the muscles -- and the capabilities birds have to change the shape of their bodies , it is something that will take many years , tens of years , maybe 20 years to get something like that into a robot			0
