@entity0 -- @entity2 was a giant in late 20th century @entity5 politics , in large part due to her revolutionary approach to the economy			1
it is no accident that her economic strategy and policies became known as " @entity13			0
" her policies revolutionized the domestic economy and also had huge influence abroad -- not least of all in the countries of @entity18 and @entity19 , freed from @entity21 control in the early 1990s			2
to get an idea of the enormity of her influence it is vital to understand the parlous state @entity5 was in the 1960s and 1970s			1
@entity29 : @entity5 's " @entity30 " dies at 87 it was a country that , in the words of former @entity36 secretary of state @entity35 , had " lost an empire and has not yet found a role " and it was a country that was persistently underperforming its @entity39 neighbors			1
indeed it was the feeling that the six of the @entity42 ( @entity43 ) were leaving @entity5 behind economically that was one of the main reasons for its membership in 1973			1
but , @entity43 membership did not solve @entity5 's problems			1
@entity5 's problems , including the appalling industrial relations , were only tackled when @entity2 became prime minister in 1979			1
when i was a young civil servant in the 1970s in the @entity54 , i was told that government in @entity5 was all about " managing decline			1
share your memories , tributes and thoughts on @entity2 's death on @entity63 both the major parties ( @entity64 and @entity65 ) had adopted a quasi-consensus , @entity68 interventionist approach to the economy post @entity69 , in which large parts of the productive economy , including the utilities , were state monopolies			1
competition was a foreign , if not a dirty , word			0
and high taxes blunted entrepreneurial spirits and business activity			2
under these circumstances it should have been of no surprise to anyone , that @entity5 's future was indeed was all about managing decline			1
the image of an aristocratic family down on its luck , wearing threadbare jackets and scuffed shoes , comes to mind			0
enterprise , profit , low taxes and risk - taking were concepts that were foreign ( and especially @entity36 ) in @entity5			2
it is absolutely no exaggeration to say that @entity2 changed the whole approach to the economy and business			1
" managing decline " was not for her			0
she was determined to implement the policies , however uncomfortable and unpalatable they were at the time , to inject energy , enterprise and competition into business and into the economy			2
tinkering interventionism was out and union reform ( long overdue ) , privatization , competition , sound public finances and low taxes were in			0
all in all , her polices amounted to a " supply side " revolution			0
and it was a revolution			0
businesses and entrepreneurs were now to be seen as the drivers of economic growth and not interfering governments			0
the default mechanism of post-war @entity5 economic policy was reset			2
it was a staggering success			0
after a rocky start -- there was a nasty recession in the early 1980s from which parts of manufacturing did not recover -- the @entity5 economy began to perform significantly better			1
@entity137 with canny policies to free up the @entity139 and attract inward investment , @entity5 became the number one destination for overseas investment			2
the sense of defeatism was consigned , at least at the time , to history			0
in the late 1980s and early 1990s i well remember my @entity149 colleagues ' admiration for her and all that she had done for @entity5 's standing in the international business world , and their sheer bemusement when she was forced out of office			1
@entity2 was a politician of enormous skill , determination , courage and , above all else , conviction			1
and she was ably assisted by , amongst others , @entity161 ( @entity163 ) @entity162 , @entity164 ( @entity166 ) @entity165 , @entity167 and @entity161			0
they helped her push through her vision against the most appalling opposition from the unions to the economics profession and the @entity176			0
sadly , much of her excellent work was destroyed under the @entity180 government when chancellor @entity182 's profligacy wrecked the public finances and his ill - advised changes to banking supervision severely damaged the financial system			0
speaking as one who saw the @entity189 revolution " in action , " i find it immensely saddening			0
we need a new @entity2 , one with the vision to correct the country 's horrendous problems , as she did in the 1980s			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity198			2
