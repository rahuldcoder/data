-- a report from @entity2 says the wave of popular unrest sweeping @entity5 and the @entity6 makes this a critical time for the human rights movement -- one that could result in historic gains by freedom - loving , tech - savvy people or distressing setbacks if oppressive regimes clamp down on activists and stay in power			1
the report , which coincides with the advocacy group 's 50th anniversary , documents what it claims are cases of torture , unwarranted imprisonment , restrictions on freedom of expression and other alleged abuses around the world			0
@entity32 , for example , is among those countries called out for its restrictions on predominantly @entity37 women wearing veils			0
@entity2 also challenges @entity39 over its alleged repression of free expression , notes the dire conditions for pregnant women in @entity44 and points to difficulties wrought by violence in parts of @entity5			1
yet the so - called " @entity57 " is front - and - center in the report , with its authors singling out the popular movements against generally long - entrenched administrations as a time of great promise and danger			2
throngs of mostly young people helped to peacefully oust heads of state in @entity61 and @entity62 , while governments in countries such as @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 have thus far resisted similar attempts -- killing civilians in the process , according to @entity2			1
" not since the end of the @entity75 have so many oppressive governments faced such a challenge to their stranglehold of power , " @entity72 , @entity2 's leader , said in a press release			2
" the demand for political and economic rights spreading across the @entity6 and @entity5 is dramatic proof that all rights are equally important and a universal demand			1
" but @entity85 , a @entity86 professor , said one factor distinguishing what happened in @entity61 and @entity62 -- where mass popular movements helped unseat @entity61 's @entity90 and @entity62 's @entity92 @entity91 , who had led their countries for 30 and 23 years respectively -- from the institution of new governments in places like @entity44 is that there is less outside control of what happens next			1
that could mean such nation 's new governments -- perhaps after democratic elections -- could choose to restrict women 's , immigrants or others ' rights			2
if so , these popular revolutions could put those groups promoting human rights in a tough spot			1
" the question is what happens if you have a democratization process that does n't lead to greater civil liberties , " said @entity85 , who has worked with @entity2 and other human rights groups through the course of his career			1
" ( @entity121 revolutions ) do n't always lead to good things			0
" worse yet is what might happen if those pushing for change in places like @entity66 , @entity65 , @entity67 and @entity128 fail after being beat back by ruling governments , human rights advocates say			1
some leaders such as @entity68 's @entity132 may become more defiant in the face of outside and internal opposition , while others may be emboldened if they survive popular dissent , experts say			0
the part of @entity2 's report about the @entity6 and @entity5 highlighted what it called " governments ' preoccupation with their political security , but neglect of their people 's human security and failure to uphold the human rights on which it depends			1
" already , these popular pushes for new governments have come at a stiff human cost			2
" those calls for democracy have led to violence , " said @entity85 , noting the real danger to human lives when people push for major reforms			0
" there have been deaths in the thousands			0
" another challenge for groups like @entity2 is determining how to promote a pro-rights agenda in places with authoritarian leaders and little in the way of democratic institutions or history			1
in its report , @entity2 touts technology , specifically social networking tools like @entity174 and @entity175 , with being a powerful , non-violent tool that did n't exist years ago			2
this allows people to circumvent censorship and communicate directly with one another , on an even platform			0
" information is a source of power , and for those challenging the abuse of power by states and other institutions , it is an exciting time , " @entity72 writes in the @entity2 report			2
but @entity85 said that , at some point , rights ' groups may have to wrestle with the merit of backing military efforts to overthrow totalitarian regimes			0
that might mean supporting airstrikes in @entity68 , for instance , that could lead to civilian casualties			0
the @entity2 report makes a point to stress that its accounts of human rights abuses -- and the need for a movement to prevent them -- are not confined to the @entity6 and @entity5			1
in 2010 alone , the group said it has documented specific cases of " torture and other ill - treatment " in 98 countries			0
" its investigators , moreover , have recorded or investigated human rights abuses in 157 countries and territories			1
@entity2 alleges , for instance , that " virtually any form of dissent was suppressed in @entity217 , " while law enforcement were said to have attacked " human rights defenders " in @entity219			1
the group alleges discrimination against immigrants in parts of mainland @entity225 , criticizing efforts to deport people in need			0
crackdowns on journalists working to unearth corruption was a problem in many nations , according to @entity2			2
nearly 400 journalists were threatened or attacked last year in @entity236 alone , the report contends			0
" there has not been any accountability , " said @entity237 , a special adviser on human rights at @entity2 , on what has happened in parts of @entity241			1
" that 's why the situation is so bad so now , because that culture of impunity has been very , very unchanged			0
" despite all the documented problems and challenges , @entity72 -- @entity2 's secretary - general -- voices optimism that popular movements will ultimately prevail , with human rights becoming an even more universally recognized and realized value			1
" the call for justice , freedom and dignity has evolved into a global demand that grows stronger every day , " he said			0
" the genie is out of the bottle , and the forces of repression can not put it back			0
" @entity0 's @entity265 and @entity266 contributed to this report .			0
