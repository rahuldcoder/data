with @entity2 's @entity1 mountain retreat set to undergo a multi-million dollar makeover , travel to the onetime lairs and luxury retreats of tyrants is in the spotlight			1
many monuments built by megalomaniacs are open to the public			0
from @entity13 's nuclear bunker to @entity15 's summer house to @entity17 's villa , autocrat hideouts have become tourist attractions			1
does visiting places associated with ruthless dictatorships serve as a useful history lesson ? or is it a disservice to the memories of those who suffered under brutal regimes ? it can be uncomfortable posing for pictures at places where the darkest events of the @entity31 were carried out			0
yet the preservation of such sites also serves as an important reminder of historic atrocities			0
all of these places are easy enough to get to			0
whether you actually want to go is another question ... @entity2 : @entity39 , @entity40 this mountain retreat near the town of @entity43 in the @entity44 was originally a place where @entity2 could receive visiting dignitaries			1
the chalet is reached via a 124 - meter elevator drilled into the mountain			0
on the same mountain , a backup @entity31 command base -- the @entity51 -- was destroyed by @entity54 bombing			0

purpose built , complete with palm trees imported from @entity79 and sniper emplacements , this was @entity15 's favorite escape from @entity82			1
it 's now a small and somewhat uncomfortable museum , where a waxwork of the mass - murdering @entity87 leader can be found sitting at his old desk			2

the hilltop hideaway is now used for keeping visiting heads of state out of harm 's way , but when no dignitaries are in town , it can be visited as part of a guided tour			1
anecdotes about @entity117 's home life are conspicuous by their absence			2

he wanted the property , about 55 kilometers from central @entity145 , to top the @entity146 -- which had hated royal associations			0
the emperor had his imperial court at @entity139 -- more than 1,000 people could stay in the chateau at one time -- and most of the decor and furnishing dates to @entity138 's era			1

the former farmhouse is now @entity184 's @entity183 -- a religious retreat , usually booked out by groups on weekends , but letting rooms to individuals during the week			1
there 's little regal grandeur -- just frugal , unfussy rooms and chickens running round the gardens			0
