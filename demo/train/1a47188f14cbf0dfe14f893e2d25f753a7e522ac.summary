@entity0 -- the @entity2 lost track of two former participants in the federal witness @entity5 " identified as known or suspected terrorists , " according to the public summary of an interim justice department inspector general 's report obtained by @entity1			1
the @entity2 has concluded that " one individual was and the other individual was believed to be residing outside of the @entity13 , " according to the summary			0
a @entity16 official said in response to follow up questions about the matter by reporters on thursday that the pair had left the program years ago and had been accounted for			1
it was not clear when or for how long the @entity2 lost track of them			0
the report notes that while in the middle of an audit of the witness program , the inspector general notified the @entity16 of national security vulnerabilities			1
the agency watchdog " developed the interim report to help ensure that the @entity16 promptly and sufficiently addressed the deficiencies we found			0
" after its audit , the inspector general 's office reported that " the department did not definitively know how many known or suspected terrorists were admitted " into the witness program , " among other " significant issues concerning national security			1
" as of march 2013 , the @entity16 was reviewing more than 18,000 program case files to determine whether more known or suspected terrorists have been admitted , the summary notes			2
as such , the number of terrorists lost or unaccounted for " may not be complete and may continue to evolve			0
" the summary said that although the @entity2 was giving known or suspected terrorists who participated in the witness program and their dependents new names and identity documents , the @entity16 " was not authorizing the disclosure to a federal center that operates a terrorist watch list that helps provide information to the @entity53 's " no - fly " database			1
" therefore it was possible for known or suspected terrorists to fly on commercial airplanes in or over the @entity13 and evade one of the government 's primary means of identifying and tracking terrorists ' movements and actions , " the summary said			2
the inspector general 's office notified the @entity16 of the problems and in the middle of remedying them , the @entity2 discovered it could not account for the two missing people			1
a @entity16 official who spoke to reporters about the matter said on thursday that the agency knows the whereabouts of witness program participants			2
" as for the two people you 're talking about , we know they left the country years ago , they left the program years ago , they have been accounted for			0
there has been no information provided that they have ever returned to the @entity13 , " according to the official who spoke the @entity16 said in an earlier statement that the @entity94 had " not identified a national security threat tied to the participation of terrorism - linked witnesses			2
" a @entity16 official also told @entity1 that the pair " completed their obligations to the @entity13 government by cooperating against terrorists " and were not fugitives			1
the official added that " for obvious reasons , we can not comment on the exact location of any current or former participant " in the program			0
the development broke in the midst of a difficult week for the @entity110 administration , with revelations that the @entity16 secretly collected months of phone records for reporters and editors at @entity115 ; renewed criticism and accusations of a cover - up over the @entity120 's response to the deadly attack on the @entity13 mission in @entity123 , and revelations that the @entity125 targeted conservative groups applying for tax - exempt status			0
