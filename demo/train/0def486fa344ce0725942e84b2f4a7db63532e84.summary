-- the slow process of updating the rules that dictate when and if you can use electronic devices on airplanes is inching along , with one major agency urging more freedom to use tablets , e-readers and other gadgets			1
in august , the @entity11 announced plans for a working group that would study the issue of portable electronics on flights and then make suggestions for changes			1
now that committee is starting to come together			0
on thursday , the @entity20 sent a letter to the @entity11 , officially announcing who will represent the @entity20 in the working group			1
the letter also included words of support for the initiative			0
the letter was first obtained by @entity30 blog			0
" i write to urge the @entity11 to enable greater use of tablets , e-readers , and other portable electronic devices during flight , consistent with public safety , " @entity20 chairman @entity31 said in the letter			1
the working group will also include representatives from the electronics industry , pilots and flight attendant groups , plane manufacturers and other government agencies			2
once established , the representatives will meet for six months and eventually give suggestions to the @entity11 about what devices are safe to use onboard and when they can be used			2
the group will not discuss cell phone use in the air , which is banned by the @entity20 because of the potential for interference with wireless networks on the ground			1
the other rules for gadget use on planes are established by the @entity11 , including a ban against the use of personal electronics during takeoff and landing , when the plane is below 10,000 feet			1
electronic health devices such as hearing aids and pacemakers are allowed at all times			0
the @entity11 regulations can be frustrating to passengers , but they are in place to prevent interference with planes ' communication and navigation systems			2
while there has n't been any conclusive proof that devices such as tablets and e-readers are a danger , a study last year found 75 instances of interference that may have been related to personal electronic devices			0
while thursday 's @entity20 letter does n't reveal anything new about the process , the reaction in the news and on social networks is telling			2
people are eager for the @entity11 and airlines to catch up with the latest technology			0
they want to read their kindles during take - off , listen to soothing music on smartphones in airplane mode during turbulence and silence fussy children with cartoons on 7 - inch tablets .			0
