-- it 's not surprising that at a town meeting this week , @entity2 , @entity3 , voted 183 - 50 to impose a $ 20 fine for swearing in public			1
who 's not for civic virtue ? enough is enough			2
plus the ban does n't apply to what people do " in private			1
" but it 's an empty , hopeless move			1
not to mention plain backward			0
for one , it 's like trying put out a fire with an eyedropper			2
the police can not monitor most public activities			1
say they pass out some fines to teens waiting in line for a concert			2
still , those offended by their language will be endlessly assaulted with it when passing the same teens as they walk down unpatrolled streets , or chat before a movie starts , or , basically , just exist			0
overheard on @entity0 : what the $ % # ; ! ? choice words for town 's profanity fine besides , the fines will only create the kind of resentment that makes it feel sexy to rebel			1
nothing will feel more authentic to the @entity2 teen than to haul off with a few epithets when no police are in view -- but plenty of other citizens are			2
and all we have to do is wait for the cleverer ones to claim that certain uses of the words are n't really profanity , which will mean messy cases of where - do - you - draw - the - line			1
is hell in " it was so from hell that he called me " a curse word ? or , if someone says something is " f --- --- awesome , " is that profanity ? remember how at one point even the @entity64 , based on that reasoning , let @entity65 get by with saying that winning an award was " really , really f --- - brilliant " at the @entity68 ceremony in 2003 ? @entity69 need to rethink what is considered profanity in 2012			1
we are taught that a certain collection of words is profane , but this no longer makes sense given the readiness with which even the most mild - mannered of @entity69 use such words			1
sure , there are an especially careful few among us who rarely use them			0
most of us chuckle that it was considered a big deal for @entity87 to say " damn " in " @entity88 " -- or that a newspaper would n't have allowed me to use that word in print			1
or take a sentence like " we 've got to get all of this stuff out of the garage			0
" how many of us can honestly say that there is n't an alternate word we would quite possibly use for " stuff " ? and a lot ? what our great - grandparents considered profanity is , for us , merely colorful			1
we teach our kids not to use it -- but are hardly surprised that they start doing so later			0
the characters on @entity107 's " girls " curse like sailors , and yet we can assume that their parents were telling them in the ' 90s not to use bad words -- while using them themselves , as we have heard the mother of the show 's lead , @entity115 , do already			1
we are an informal society			0
we dress scantily compared with earlier @entity69			0
we talk openly about sex and excretion in a way that still shocks our grandparents			0
we cherish the " real			0
" our sense of profanity lags behind our reality			1
now , do n't get me wrong -- we do have genuine profanity			2
the n - word and the one beginning with c that refers to a female body part are the main curses today			1
these are truly taboo , in the sense an anthropologist studying us would recognize			0
to haul off with these words is to leave one 's moral legitimacy in question			2
note , however , that one can not even shield one 's children from the n - word			1
it decorates their favorite music , rap , and not just the raunchier strains			0
@entity146 's eternally infectious " @entity147 " hit enshrines it in its very chorus , for example			2
or , a friend of mine , white , recently told me that her boys are attending a mostly black public school and making a lot of friends -- but also picking up their way of using the n - word as a marker of fellowship			1
so , let 's fine them $ 20 for embracing diversity ? it 's hard to see what the benefits of an ordinance such as @entity2 's will be			0
the smidgen less that people will hear profanity on @entity172 will transform the linguistic environment about as much as a cold drink makes you think it is n't actually hot			2
or is the idea that the ordinance will nevertheless get an idea in the air , in the way that smoking gradually became uncool and @entity183 mayor @entity182 hopes will happen with massive sugary drinks ? unlikely			0
young people do n't model their language usage on what they hear at the shoe store			0
they will pick up the lingo from music , @entity191 , @entity192 and texting -- not to mention their own parents talking about that , um , stuff in the garage			0
our job is to teach children that certain words are not to be used until a certain age , and even then , with care			0
that has worked pretty well for a long time after all			0
as for the fact that we hear the words in public more than we used to , i suggest we bring our sense of " dirty " into line with the rest of our modern come - as - you - are @entity69 spirits			1
or if we ca n't see it that way , we might just accept teens ' potty mouths the way we do cracks in the pavement and overripe trash cans -- inevitable dings in this thing called life			0
let 's face it : in 2012 , an ordinance against public profanity is like fining people for burping			1
what kind of priority is this in an age when so many more urgent issues face us all ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity234 .			2

@entity234 : a town 's recent ban on public swearing is a hopeless cause
@entity234 asks : where do you draw the line ? is hell a swear word ? how do police enforce it ?
profanity is part of the *cultural* *discourse* ; even mild - mannered people curse , he says
@entity234 : we need to rethink what is considered profanity in 2012 and just accept reality
