@entity0 -- embattled @entity6 strongman @entity5 's forces have made significant strides against rebel fighters , as the @entity9 is working quickly to pass a resolution authorizing international intervention , a senior @entity3 official told senators thursday			1
in remarks to the @entity14 , @entity15 , the undersecretary for political affairs at the @entity3 , said @entity5 's forces are only about 160 kilometers ( about 100 miles ) outside of the rebel stronghold of @entity19			1
" they 've made advances taking full advantage of their overwhelming military superiority in military fire power , " @entity15 said			2
@entity15 expressed fear that @entity5 , now isolated by the world community , could turn to terrorism again			2
" i think there is also a very real danger that if @entity5 is successful on the ground , that you will also face a number of other considerable risks as well -- the danger of him returning to terrorism , and violent extremism himself , the dangers of the turmoil that he could help create at a critical moment elsewhere in the region , " @entity15 told the committee			2
senators , in turn , expressed frustration with the lack of progress by the @entity47 in responding to @entity5 beyond sanctions and warnings , as the @entity47 tries to build international consensus for any military intervention			1
" when is that resolution going to happen , after the bloodbath , in the middle of the bloodbath ? " asked @entity53 @entity52 sen. @entity52			0
the @entity9 @entity58 is meeting in @entity59 thursday , debating forceful options that would go beyond a no - fly zone , @entity15 told the senators			1
a vote is schedule for thursday evening			0
when sen. @entity65 , @entity66 , asked what those options would include , such as targeted air strikes on @entity5 's weapons , jamming of government radio signals , and using the tens of billions of dollars in @entity5 's assets that have been frozen , @entity15 would only say that diplomats are talking about a " whole range of measures , " including a number of the steps @entity65 mentioned			1
" we are pursuing -- along with the @entity80 , the @entity81 , @entity83 , other partners in the council -- measures that include a no - fly zone , but could go beyond that. , " @entity15 said			0
" and i ca n't in this session , since the debate is going on the @entity58 right now , go into a lot of detail about that			0
but there are measures short of boots on the ground that could be taken by the international community , including active air participation			0
" @entity15 ' remarks echoed @entity100 press secretary @entity99 , who said thursday that the @entity47 is still " actively considering " the imposition of a no - fly zone over @entity6 , and that @entity47 officials also are examining other options to put pressure on the @entity5 regime			1
with the ground situation evolving in @entity6 , @entity47 ambassador to the @entity9 @entity109 said previously this week that there are " inherent limitations " regarding a no - fly zone " in terms of protecting civilians			1
" the @entity47 military does not view a no - fly zone as sufficient to stopping @entity5			1
air force chief of staff gen. @entity117 told a @entity119 hearing on thursday that establishing such a zone " would not be sufficient " to stop the gains made by @entity5			1
@entity117 told the committee that establishing a no - fly zone would take " upwards of a week			0
" defense secretary @entity125 has cautioned about the use of a no - fly zone in the past weeks , saying it would involve a military attack on @entity6 to take out air defenses			0
on thursday , @entity132 spokesman col. @entity131 said @entity125 ' concern extends to other potential military operations in @entity6			2
" it would be logical if one of his concerns about a no - fly zone is the element of attacking @entity6 air defenses , then an option of air strikes would be pretty similar , " @entity131 told reporters at the @entity132			0
@entity15 expects the @entity9 security council to come to an agreement on a resolution thursday , but wants both operational and financial support from @entity150 states on the measures decided upon			0
