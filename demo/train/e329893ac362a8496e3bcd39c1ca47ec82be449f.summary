@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 said saturday it stands by its decision to disband the country 's soccer association -- a move that led to the association 's suspension from international football			1
world governing body @entity11 said friday it had decided to suspend the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) because of the @entity3 's move to disband it			1
@entity11 described that as governmental interference			0
the suspension means @entity18 soccer clubs and teams may not play in international matches or receive financial assistance , though @entity11 made an exception for @entity18 female players to play in a weeklong under - 16 regional football festival in @entity26 starting sunday			1
@entity11 said it learned monday that the @entity3 had disbanded the @entity12 and that governmental security forces had seized control of the @entity12 headquarters			0
@entity11 officials gave the committee 72 hours to revoke the decision and hand the headquarters back to the @entity12			0
" the deadline has expired without revocation of the decision by the @entity3 and the @entity12 has not been restored to its headquarters , " @entity11 said in a statement friday			1
" the @entity39 has therefore decided to immediately suspend the @entity12 until the decision of the @entity3 is revoked and the @entity12 retakes possession of its offices			0
" the @entity3 's actions are in " total contradiction " to @entity11 statutes , which require national teams to have full independence , @entity11 said			1
two top @entity18 officials said saturday the decision to disband the @entity12 was based on financial and administrative irregularities and violations , and that they were not surprised by @entity11 's decision and had expected it			1
@entity53 , a senior member of the @entity3 , told @entity2 he was hopeful the issue could be resolved with @entity11 in the coming days , and that the @entity56 committee had international lawyers working on the issue			2
he denied , however , that government security forces had seized @entity12 headquarters , saying the men were protection services personnel guarding the building			0
@entity64 , the @entity18 government spokesman who has been delegated for months to deal with the @entity66 , told @entity2 he will work on cooperating with @entity11 's demands and holding transparent @entity12 elections			2
he said the suspension " will not have a major effect " on @entity18 football because the national team has no international matches scheduled over the next six months			1
it is the second time @entity11 has suspended @entity18 football			1
the first time was in may last year , after the @entity18 government dissolved the national olympic committee and all national sports federations			0
@entity11 lifted the ban after the @entity18 government excluded the @entity12 from dissolution			0
@entity18 soccer has come a long way since the days of @entity83 , when @entity83 's son , @entity84 , was president of the @entity3 and regularly threatened players with physical violence and torture if they played poorly			2
the national soccer team has continued playing , however , and has been viewed as something that has united @entity18 across sectarian lines			0
although @entity1 has not qualified for next year 's @entity92 in @entity93 , the national team was able to celebrate becoming the @entity95 champions in 2007			1
in july , @entity1 played its first home game since 2002 , beating its @entity98 opponents 4 - 0			0
tens of thousands attended the match in the capital after @entity11 lifted its ban on international games in @entity1			2
