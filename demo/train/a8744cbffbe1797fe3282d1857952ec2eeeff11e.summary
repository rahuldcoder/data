@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity1 man suffering from @entity5 's disease says he wants to die by having his organs harvested rather than wait for his degenerative nerve ailment to kill him			1
@entity8 has been battling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , as the disease is formally known , since 2008			1
the 61 - year - old told @entity11 's " @entity14 " on thursday that the diagnosis is " a death sentence , positively , no questions asked , " and he wants do donate his organs while he still can			1
" if people have their legs cut off or their wife left them and they commit suicide , it 's another story			2
they still have a life ahead of them			0
but i do not , " he said			0
and for people waiting for transplants , " there 's nothing greater than for a family member to receive an organ so they can watch their family grow up			1
" @entity5 's disease attacks the nerves in the brain and spinal cord , affecting voluntary muscle control			1
in its later stages , the disease can leave sufferers paralyzed but fully conscious and alert			1
@entity8 lives in @entity40 , @entity1 , about 50 miles north of @entity0			1
he conceded his decision is " not for everyone , " but said his family supports him -- a statement backed up with some qualifications by his daughter , @entity46			0
" we kind of said , ' ok , well , let 's not do this at this very second , ' but to find out more about it , " @entity47 said			0
but she said that when her father 's disease " gets to the point where he 's lost his pride or become humiliated in how he 's having to suffer and the indignities ... we 're not going to have an issue with that			1
" about 5,600 @entity63 a year are diagnosed with the disease , according to the @entity65 , a nonprofit group that advocates for more research on the disease			1
those diagnosed typically live two to five years			0
but some , like famed @entity70 physicist @entity69 , survive for decades			0
@entity8 ' offer is " admirable , and our heart goes out to him , " @entity71 , an emergency medicine physician at the @entity72 , told @entity11			1
" but 10 percent of people can live 20 years with this disease			2
" @entity71 said what @entity8 wants to do amounts to physician - assisted suicide , a practice legal in only three @entity63 states -- @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86			2
and in those states , patients who seek to end their lives are typically in the last stages of a terminal disease			0
" we donate organs in patients that , say , are brain dead or have terminal events , " she said			0
most doctors " would have a problem " with what @entity8 wants to do , because " at this point , he 's fairly healthy			1
" " i ca n't picture any states essentially putting , right now , a relatively healthy man under anesthesia , taking out vital organs like his heart and taking him off the ventilator , " @entity71 said			0
and @entity65 is unlikely to harm the organs most likely to be used for transplants unless some sort of related infection strikes them , she said			2
@entity8 has also taken his appeal online			2
in a video posted on the website @entity115 , he argues that 90,000 people a year die waiting for organ transplants , and compares his situation to a soldier in a foxhole throwing himself on a grenade to save his comrades			0
" i am not suicidal , " he says			0
" i just know that it is a matter of time before i die and wish to do a good thing for those people who have a good life expectancy "			0

@entity8 says he 's under a " death sentence "
" there 's nothing greater than for a family member to receive an organ "
doctor : physicians are unlikely to go along with the @entity1 man 's plan
some @entity65 sufferers live for decades with the disease
