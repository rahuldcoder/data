@entity0 had no idea who comedian @entity3 was until @entity3 's sister and niece were detained with her sunday in @entity6 for wearing prayer shawls as they prayed at the @entity8			1
police detained 10 women for " performing a religious act contrary to the local customs			1
" the group of women , who call themselves the @entity15 , went to pray in @entity17 shawls known as tallitot that @entity20 law says only @entity17 men can wear there			1
" there are lots of forbidden acts at the @entity8 : do not spit on the wall , do not pee on the wall , no slaughtering of animals at the wall , and among those one can not perform a religious act contrary to local customs at the wall , which pretty much only applies to women because there are no local customs men are forbidden from taking part in , " @entity0 said			1
she heads the @entity15 group and was a city councilwoman for 14 years			1
@entity15 says it wants equal access for all @entity17 practices and denominations at the holiest site for prayer in @entity44			1
about 100 women , including @entity0 and @entity46 , who is a reform rabbi , went to the wall property to pray for @entity48 , the 12th month of the @entity17 year , and 10 of them went down to the @entity8 itself			1
they were detained as they were leaving the premises after they prayed			2
" there is a designated place where they can wear the shawl on the property of the @entity8 but not at the wall itself , " @entity20 @entity9 spokesman @entity51 told @entity52			2
" ten of the 100 women with the group came and prayed at the @entity8			2
they were detained and released after a couple of hours and given a warning they have to stay away from the wall for 15 days			2
we take our orders from a @entity72 decision			0
until there is another decision or change , those are our clear orders			0
" in 2003 , @entity20 's @entity72 said the women could pray and read from the @entity80 while wearing the shawls at a different location on the property near the wall , but it did allow them at the @entity8 itself , the organization 's attorney said			1
when @entity3 heard what her sister and the other women were detained for , she was quick to respond with a tweet that said : " so proud of my amazing sister and niece for their balls out civil disobedience			2
ur the tits ! " comedian @entity3 's representatives sent this response to the incident to @entity52 : " i do n't care much for people who use religion as a cloak to justify hatred , injustice and fear			0
and i ca n't imagine @entity105 , should he or she or it exist , does either			0
i am so proud of my sister and niece for fighting for what they believe in -- by having the nerve to pray at a @entity8 of prayer while being female			0
" women are allowed to pray at the @entity8			2
the 10 women were detained sunday for wearing the shawls			1
@entity15 members have gone to the wall wearing prayer shawls for 24 years			1
but the organizers said it was just in the past 22 months that police have detained or arrested them			1
for years , the women say , ushers who work at the wall , not police , were the ones who moved them away			1
over the past 22 months , they said , one woman has been arrested and more than 40 detained			1
@entity0 said she was the one arrested			0
she said she was handcuffed at the hands and feet when she was taken to jail last year and spent 24 hours there			0
she refused to sign a police declaration that said she was guilty of breaking the law , and she did not agree to refrain from such actions again			0
" it was 24 hours of hell , " she said			0
this time around , she and the other women were only held at the police station , not taken to jail			2
but this wo n't be the last time they try to do what they think they should be allowed to do at the @entity8			0
@entity0 said that at first , she did n't know that a famous @entity148 comedian 's sister was part of the group			0
" i had no idea who @entity3 was , but i do now			0
she is one funny woman			0
i had no idea they 'd let a woman talk like that in the @entity148 " she said as she laughed .			0
