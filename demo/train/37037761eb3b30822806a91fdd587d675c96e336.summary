the opening two sets were shared on tiebreaks			0
16 - time grand slam champion @entity3 proceeded to force a succession of match points , all saved by a mixture of dogged defense by his @entity10 opponent or uncustomary errors by the world number two			1
the partisan crowd breathed a collective sigh of relief when @entity1 finally forced the third tiebreak of the match and claimed an early mini-break			2
@entity3 retrieved the loss but uncharacteristic forehand errors saw him fall behind again and when @entity1 was presented with his first match point he seized it			1

" i went to the limits of myself , " @entity1 admitted after his first career victory over @entity3			2
