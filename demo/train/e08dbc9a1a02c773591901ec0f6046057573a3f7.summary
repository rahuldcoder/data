@entity0 -- jobs and money , national identity and political stability			2
these are some of the contentious issues driving the presidential election in @entity9 this weekend			2
seeking another four - year term is the incumbent president @entity11 of the ruling @entity12 , pitted against @entity13 , leader of the @entity14 ( @entity14 )			1
who wins the election will influence @entity9 's relations with mainland @entity18 and impact business , geopolitics and security in the region , including @entity18 - @entity24 ties			1
for many @entity9 electorates , political observers say , the main issues are jobs , economics and @entity9 identity			2
for the policy - makers in @entity0 , however , the overriding question is whether the next @entity9 president will stick to the status quo			1
that means abiding by the " @entity36 , " a tacit and ambiguous agreement reached 20 years ago between @entity0 and @entity38 under which both sides agreed on the principle of " one @entity18 " without agreeing on how it is to be defined or interpreted			1
despite the ambiguity , the @entity36 has served as the basis for cross-strait dialogue that has led in recent years to the unprecedented blossoming of economic and people - to - people ties across the @entity49			0
in @entity0 's view , " zuguo tongyi , " or reunification of the motherland , is a matter of national pride and iron - clad policy			2
@entity0 says it prefers to do so peacefully but refuses to rule out the use of force to keep @entity9 from declaring itself a separate state			1
@entity18 keeps hundreds of missiles aimed at @entity9 , an ominous threat to the island to stay in the fold			1
war in the @entity49 would prompt a @entity18 - @entity24 standoff			2
in 1954 , the @entity24 and @entity9 signed a mutual defense treaty			2
even now , @entity67 sells @entity9 advanced jet fighters and other military hardware			0
@entity24 is also bound by the @entity70 , @entity24 legislation passed in 1979 , to consider an attack on the island as " a threat to the peace and security " of the region and " of grave concern to the @entity24 " but all these years , @entity67 has avoided spelling out what it would do in case military clash erupts in the @entity49			0
some observers say such ambiguity serves as a deterrent			0
others worry it could lead to miscalculations			0
that delicate balance lurks at the heart of this weekend 's election			0
incumbent president @entity11 advocates maintaining the status quo			1
" @entity11 will continue the @entity36 , " says @entity93 professor @entity92			0
" if he does that we can maintain the current relationship across the @entity49			0
" if @entity11 wins , says @entity96 , a researcher at the @entity97 ( @entity97 ) in @entity0 , " we can hopefully keep the ' peaceful development ' scenario with the mutual trust based on the @entity36			1
" @entity0 's policy - makers are wary of @entity13 , suspecting her of pushing a pro-independence agenda			1
@entity13 for one rejects the @entity36 and instead calls for a yet undefined " @entity103			0
" @entity104 , a top @entity105 official who oversees @entity9 affairs , recently warned : " if we deny the status quo there is no way to carry on any further negotiations , and what we have achieved so far would be in vain			0
we would go back to the days of chaos and uncertainty			0
" but @entity96 believes relations between @entity0 and @entity38 will see a drastic change if @entity14 gets elected			1
" there is no way @entity18 will keep the current level of talks if @entity9 claims itself to be a country , " he says			1
" if so , @entity9 's economy will certainly decline if the life blood from the mainland gets cut off			0
" but @entity93 's @entity92 downplays any worst - case scenarios			0
" even if @entity13 wins the election , she will adopt a moderate policy to mainland @entity18 , " he opines			1
there are good reasons not to rock the boat , mostly money			0
closer ties between @entity9 and the mainland , observers say , have brought significant " peace dividends " to both sides -- robust business and trade , tourism , academic and people - to - people exchanges and family reunions			2
two - way trade last year topped @entity24 $ 160 billion , according to estimates by @entity18 's customs bureau			1
over the years , @entity9 investors , big and small , have pumped billions of dollars of investment into @entity18			1
last year alone , they invested over @entity24 $ 12 billion in 520 projects on the mainland , according to a report by the state - run @entity152 new agency			0
mainland companies , on the other hand , invested @entity24 $ 174 million into over 200 projects in @entity9 in the short time since @entity9 allowed mainland investments in june 2009 , @entity152 said			0
since @entity9 opened its borders to mainland tourists three - and - a - half years ago , says @entity161 , head of @entity18 's tourism agency , over three million mainlanders have visited the island			1
last year alone , 1.8 million joined tours or went as individual travelers , @entity161 added			0
in contrast , about five million @entity9 tourists visited the mainland last year , according to @entity170			2
but for the @entity173 leadership in @entity0 closer ties also poses a downside : they bring a democratic contagion to the mainland			0
on @entity178 , @entity18 's equivalent of @entity179 , @entity177 writes : " no matter who wins , it 's the victory of @entity9 's voters and the democracy they 've been practicing			1
we mainlanders should just stay calm and learn something , since we now ca n't really do much			0
" while the @entity9 electorate is able to directly elect their president and other leaders this weekend , @entity18 's political elite is still struggling behind closed doors to reach a consensus on who among them will take top positions ahead of the major political transition later this year			1
in the autumn , vice president @entity197 , 58 , is expected to replace 69 - year - old @entity199 as party chief when the @entity105 holds its national congress -- an event that takes place every five years			1
@entity197 is expected to formally ascend as state president when @entity18 's legislature convenes in the spring of 2013 .			2
