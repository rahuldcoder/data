-- i vividly recall those 13 days in the fall of 1962 , watching president @entity3 on our black and white television in @entity6 , @entity7			1
i was a professor at @entity8 focusing on the emerging field of leadership studies , and the @entity11 was about leadership writ large for the world to witness			0
fifty years after the @entity3 assassination , there is conversation everywhere about @entity3 's unrealized potential			1
amid the wave of sentimental reflection this year , there has been much focus on the mythical elements of @entity23 or too many details about that tragic day in @entity25 , and not enough on the real - world challenges of the @entity3 presidency			1
i believe @entity3 's legacy as a leader during the immensely difficult times of the early 1960s has been underestimated -- today , his imprint on the world political scene is powerful and far - reaching			1
from the outset of his presidency , @entity3 had a great deal to prove to the country and to his hometown of @entity38			1
there was a saying that the 617 area code , which included @entity38 and @entity6 , was the most opinionated enclave in the country , which i believe to be accurate			0
many of my colleagues and friends at @entity8 and @entity46 were skeptical of @entity3			1
there was a sentiment that perhaps he did not have the gravitas to be president , that he was too young , too inexperienced , too dependent upon his powerful family			0
i met @entity53 in 1959 in @entity54 during the early stages of his presidential campaign , and would later serve on a @entity58 task force that he created			0
i was initially impressed with him -- he was engaging and moved easily from the daily demands of campaign responsibilities to the larger issues before him in the presidential race			0
still , after he was inaugurated in january 1961 , we could not have predicted how the presidency would unfold			0
for me , and for many others , the defining moment of his administration remains the @entity11			0
watching @entity3 and his team play one of the highest stakes poker games that the world had witnessed was at once exhilarating and frightening			2
his mastery of diplomacy and politics succeeded in getting the @entity79 to withdraw nuclear missiles from @entity81			0
this was a very different @entity3 from the uncertain president who failed miserably in the @entity84			1
the difference ? @entity3 had learned from his mistakes and the groupthink mentality of the @entity89			1
his management of the @entity11 became a legendary example of a leader drawing the best from multiple advisers and making his decisions only after weighing each very different contribution			0
@entity3 learned that in order to succeed , he must create a culture of candor among his inner circle , that he needed the confidence to hear their truths , and his team in turn the courage and freedom to speak those truths			1
this remains today a lesson that far too few presidents -- or @entity112 -- since @entity3 have embraced			1
the successful outcome of the @entity11 would not have been possible had @entity3 not recruited some of the sharpest minds of his era , those @entity113 would later famously describe as the best and the brightest			2
@entity3 intentionally made government service attractive , to ambitious , intelligent achievers through his diverse cabinet and state department appointments			2
much like @entity122 , @entity3 believed in the value of great ideas and people , surrounding himself with the smartest people in any room			1
but perhaps @entity3 's greatest quality as a leader was his ability to inspire -- to reach the @entity132 people on an emotional and personal level			1
like @entity134 , @entity3 transcended a patrician background to touch the hearts of everyday @entity132			2
his inaugural speech set the tone for his presidency , and when he implored an optimistic audience to do for their country , they listened and responded			0
they believed in him as he launched an aggressive space exploration program , they volunteered as he created a new global volunteer program called the @entity148 , they followed the every move of his beautiful wife and children			0
almost 50 years after that horrific day in @entity25 , @entity153 -- the only living member of @entity3 's @entity23 -- stood in front of a @entity157 committee and was confirmed as the @entity132 ambassador to @entity159			2
she captured the enduring leadership legacy of her father as she pledged that she was committed to " public service , a more just @entity132 and a more peaceful world			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity167 .			2

@entity167 : @entity3 had a lot to prove to people when he was *elected*
the president who dealt with disastrous @entity84 learned a lesson , he says
@entity167 : in cuban missile crisis , @entity3 created a culture of candor in his inner circle
he says few presidents or chief *executive* *officers* have followed in his path
