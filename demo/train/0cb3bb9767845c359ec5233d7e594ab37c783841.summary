@entity0 -- workers at the crippled @entity6 nuclear power plant have discovered a radioactive hot spot far more lethal than anything previously recorded at the damaged facility , the plant 's owner reported tuesday			1
the reading at the base of a ventilation tower between the no. 1 and no. 2 reactors monday afternoon was 10,000 millisieverts per hour , the @entity15 announced -- high enough that a 60 - minute exposure could kill a man or woman within weeks			1
a @entity20 expert told @entity1 that radioactive particles most likely concentrated in that area in the first days of the disaster , as plant operators tried to vent the damaged reactors			1
by comparison , the average resident of an industrialized country receives 3 millisieverts of background radiation per year , while the highest level reported in the days following the disaster was about 400 millisieverts			1
@entity15 immediately cordoned off the area and is investigating both the cause of the high radiation and how it will affect the recovery work , company spokesman @entity32 said			1
none of the workers who made the discovery have been injured , the company said			0
the @entity6 plant , located about 240 kilometers ( 150 miles ) north of @entity0 , was flooded by the tsunami that followed @entity43 's march 11 earthquake			0
the result was the worst nuclear accident since the @entity46 , as the plant 's three operating reactors melted down and spewed vast quantities of radioactive particles across the surrounding area			0
the disaster has caused @entity43 to rethink its commitment to nuclear energy , and @entity55 has since announced plans to abandon atomic power entirely by 2022			2
@entity58 was , a nuclear engineering professor at the @entity60 , said the location of the hot spot suggests the radioactive material was filtered from air and steam released to relieve pressure inside the reactors during the meltdowns			1
" as they were venting , either intentionally or unintentionally , the building air was being sent through filters , " was said			2
those filters may have been concentrating radioactive particles " into one spot , " he said			0
was said the use of a gamma - ray camera could help identify whether the source of the radioactivity was reactor waste products , bits of nuclear fuel or both			2
@entity15 mounted a gamma - ray camera on a three - meter ( 9.75 - foot ) pole to capture images of the hot spot monday , the company said			1
@entity15 says it expects to fully wind down the crisis at @entity6 sometime between october and january			2
engineers are struggling to manage an estimated 100,000 tons of highly contaminated water that was used to cool the reactors during the emergency , and was said workers may face issues similar to the one discovered monday as they try to decontaminate that fluid			0
" those filters are going to be screaming hot , " he said			0
" as bad as the water is , those filters are going to be worse			0
" @entity1 's @entity101 contributed to this report .			0

new : the hot spot may have resulted from reactor venting , a @entity20 expert says
@entity15 is investigating the cause of the high radiation
these are the highest radiation levels since the early days of the disaster
a single 60 - minute dose would be fatal to humans within weeks
