-- the @entity1 -- a group of @entity3 regime hackers that has aggressively targeted major news organizations and activists -- may operate in cyberspace , but its attacks can have real - life impact			2
the power of misinformation was amply demonstrated when the group hacked the @entity14 @entity13 feed tuesday			1
the fake @entity14 message -- which read , " breaking : two explosions in the @entity20 and @entity21 is injured , " -- caused a brief flurry of panic and sent stocks plummeting			1
the tweet was quickly revealed as false , and the @entity23 recovered from its 145 - point dip , but it was nearly a day before the @entity14 @entity13 account was restored to life			1
now , fresh questions are being asked about what the @entity1 is , where it 's from and how it operates			2
in its own words , on is website , the @entity1 says , " we are a group of enthusiastic @entity35 youths who could not stay passive towards the massive distortion of facts about the recent uprising in @entity40			1
" over the past few months , the group claims to have hacked @entity43 broadcaster the @entity46 and @entity47 outlets @entity48 and @entity49 , as well as @entity50 and rights group @entity44			1
the group even compromised the @entity13 account monday of the head of world soccer , @entity55 president @entity54 and @entity55 's official account for the @entity57 in @entity58			1
but much about the @entity1 remains unknown			0
' @entity60 support ' from @entity40 one key question revolves around how close the group is to the government of @entity35 president @entity64 , which has been involved in a bloody civil war for more than two years			1
on that subject , all the signs are of " tacit support , " says @entity69 , a senior researcher at the @entity70 , @entity71 at the @entity72			0
he has been tracking the @entity1 since may 2011 , when it first emerged as an organized group with a @entity75 page and then its own website			2
" what we know is their domain name was registered by the @entity81			0
we looked into the @entity81 and discovered that it was headed by @entity64 in the 1990s , before he was president , " said @entity69			2
" it 's hosted on the network of the @entity35 government , which is interesting because it 's the first time we 've seen a group with questionable activities being hosted on a national computer network			1
" @entity90 has also backed the group by name and " expressed his appreciation for their work and described them as a real army on the @entity99 , " he said			0
however , @entity69 and his fellow researchers do " not have evidence that this group is actually a @entity35 government operation			1
" even if it were , he points out , the @entity35 government would be unlikely to be open about it			2
this is in part because it could face legal and political consequences for its actions -- for example , over the financial loss suffered as a result of the fake @entity14 tweet , he said			0
who the individual members of the @entity1 are and where they 're from is also shrouded in mystery			0
the group has sought to recruit volunteers through its @entity75 page , inviting them to flood selected websites with pre-prepared spam comments , said @entity69			0
" of course , we can not tell if these volunteers are from @entity40 only , or from other countries , " he added			0
many people are familiar with @entity128 , the hacker collective that is known for its @entity130 , or distributed denial of service , attacks that take websites offline , and backed the 2011 @entity134 and @entity136 ' @entity135			0
but while the @entity1 's activities bear some similarities to those of @entity128 , the group is quite different in other ways , said @entity69			2
not only do its domain name and registration betray clear connections with @entity40 , but its members are reachable through the group 's website , @entity75 and @entity13 pages			1
disrupting the flow the group also appears robust , bouncing back despite the efforts of @entity47 authorities and @entity13 to suspend its activities			0
and @entity69 has noted an evolution in the @entity1 's methods over time			0
early attacks focused on apparently irrelevant websites , but later efforts shifted first toward compromising the @entity75 pages of organizations seen as hostile to the @entity35 government , and now high - profile @entity13 accounts			1
" they demonstrate interest in disrupting the flow of information , especially the flow of information from international media , " @entity69 said of the group			0
this is not surprising because it is in line with what the @entity35 government itself has tried to do , in accusing the regional and international media of being biased against it , he said			2
tuesday 's attack on the @entity14 @entity13 feed shows " an escalation in depth but not in scale , " @entity69 said			1
while the @entity1 has compromised the @entity13 accounts of several international media organizations before , the kind of message sent to the @entity14 feed was more disturbing			1
the attack on @entity192 's @entity13 feed , for example , was hard to take seriously			1
" @entity1 was here , " read one tweet			0
" @entity195 weather station down due to head - on collision with camel , " said another			0
others were more inflammatory -- " hazardous fog warning for @entity40 : @entity200 orders terrorists to launch chemical weapons at civilian areas " -- but still not credible			0
what is worrying about the @entity14 @entity13 hack is that next time there is breaking news on @entity13 , people will wonder if it 's true or just another compromise , @entity69 said			1
it 's a warning to everyone to step up their own online security measures -- and be aware that not all they read may be true			0

the @entity1 has claimed hacks on @entity14 , @entity48 , @entity49 and the @entity46
its attack on the @entity14 @entity13 feed caused a flurry of panic and sent stocks plunging
the group is hosted on the network of the @entity35 government , says researcher
@entity35 president @entity64 has *previously* *praised* the group 's work , he says
