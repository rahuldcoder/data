-- @entity1 moved up to second place in the @entity3 on tuesday night after an emphatic 3 - 0 win over city rivals @entity5 at @entity6			1
two goals from @entity8 and a late strike from @entity10 eased @entity12 's title chasers to within three points of leaders @entity14 while consigning @entity5 to a 10th league defeat this season			1
@entity1 carried on where @entity18 had left off nine days ago , running wild through @entity5 's defense from the kick - off			1
home fans must have feared a cricket score when @entity8 scored after 44 seconds -- redirecting the ball into the net after @entity28 's shot had rebounded off the post			2
the @entity31 striker should have made it 2 - 0 in the 18th minute but produced a tame shot which was comfortably palmed away by @entity5 goalkeeper @entity33			1
as the half wore on @entity5 came back into the game but created little in front of goal			2
the break only served to re-energize the visitors who buzzed around with purpose in the final third and it was n't long before their lead was doubled			0
@entity28 's corner was met superbly by @entity8 in the 55th minute who coolly side - footed a volley past a flailing @entity33			2
@entity5 tried in vain to half the deficit but with a minute remaining @entity10 delivered the hammer blow , making space on the edge of @entity5 's penalty area before sweeping a low shot into the bottom left corner			1
@entity1 now have 66 points and trail leaders @entity14 by three points , but have two games in hand on @entity62 's side			2
@entity5 , meanwhile , are 15 points behind city with 51 points from 31 games			0
a top four finish looks increasingly unlikely			0
in the @entity3 's other two fixtures on tuesday , @entity68 could only manage a 2 - 2 draw against @entity71 at the @entity72			1
@entity73 gave the visitors an 11th minute lead before two second - half strikes in two minutes -- @entity77 followed by @entity78 -- put the @entity79 ahead with a quarter - of - an - hour to play			0
but disaster struck in the shape of a @entity83 own goal in injury time to see @entity86 's side lose further ground on the leaders following a 6 - 0 mauling at @entity90 last saturday			1
@entity68 have 63 points from 31 games and remain in fourth			0
@entity71 stay in 15th and now have 30 points			0
@entity96 ' old side , @entity95 continue to thrive under new manager @entity97			0
the @entity95 eased to a 3 - 0 win over @entity99 at @entity100 -- a result that sees them rise to fifth on 57 points , one point ahead of @entity105			1
