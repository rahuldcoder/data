-- it 's a new era for @entity3 's iconic blimp			1
you could call it the @entity6			0
cue the guitars ! the @entity10 - based tire and rubber company started testing its next - generation airship last month at @entity3 's airfield near @entity13			1
yes , this is an actual @entity15 airship , made in partnership with the @entity18 company that dates to before the infamous @entity20 disaster			1
but do n't panic , this new lighter - than - air vehicle is just as safe as its blimp predecessor			0
it 's filled with helium , not hydrogen like the humongous airship that burned in @entity27 in 1937			1
@entity3 is finally closing the door on the @entity30 - 20 models , which came off the drawing board 45 years ago			1
in the coming months , @entity3 plans to train more than 10 pilots to fly the @entity33 ( @entity33 stands for new technology			1
) if all goes as planned , we 'll be watching this sleek new silver , yellow and blue airship hovering high above sporting events east of the @entity39 this fall			0
more amenities on the new @entity3 so what 's different about this one ? it 's faster , because it has three engines instead of two			1
it can carry more passengers			0
oh , yeah , and unlike the old model , this one 's got an onboard restroom			1
believe me , i can tell you from experience that will be a relief ( literally )			0
the new blimp 's going to have seat belts			2
the older model did n't , which shook me up a little when we lifted off at a 25 - degree angle with the engines screaming			0
behind the scenes as @entity3 preps the new blimp when @entity3 capt. @entity67 let me briefly fly one of the older blimps over @entity70 on @entity71 , its engines maxed out about 50 mph			1
top speed of these @entity15 : 73 mph , increasing their range and allowing them to take part in more events			2
@entity67 instructed me on how to turn the blimp left and right with pedals on the floor			0
the cockpit aboard the @entity3 includes a joystick that will more easily allow the pilot to turn and to point up or down			2
read more about how i ended up piloting the blimp one thing that surprised me about the older blimp was its tiny gondola , which seats from three to seven people , including the pilot -- depending on whether it 's covering a sporting event			2
the new @entity3 accommodates 12			2
it 's got bigger " wrap - around windows " that @entity3 says offer improved " sweeping panoramic views			1
" i have to tell you , the views on the older blimp were still pretty damn awesome			0
it felt like we were standing atop the world 's tallest treehouse , looking out for a hundred miles in every direction			0
massive enough to blot out the sky when you stand underneath a blimp on a landing field , the thing is so massive that it blots out the sky			0
it 's nearly the length of an american football field			0
but this new airship is even longer , measuring 246 feet from tip to tail -- 54 feet more than the current blimp			2
in the older blimps , the two engines are bolted to the gondola			0
but in the new ones , engines are attached to the " envelope , " the blimp 's helium - filled " bag , " as the pilots sometimes call it			1
the bag on the new blimp is constructed with a semirigid skeleton to make it faster and more nimble			2
compare the old and new blimps it 's all part of a phase - out plan of all three @entity3 blimps ; the @entity131 retired this year in @entity132 after a record 14 - year career			1
eventually , it 's expected to go on display at an undisclosed aviation museum			0
the @entity138 , @entity139 - based @entity137 will be decommissioned in 2015 or 2016 , and finally , the @entity141 , @entity132 - based @entity140 is scheduled to retire in 2018			0
a @entity3 pilot shows how he flies the older blimp @entity3 has launched an online contest to allow the public to name the new blimp			1
tour offers zeppelin - view of @entity149 fyi , airship enthusiasts , @entity3 will continue to call these things " blimps , " even though technically , they 're not			1
as any " helium head " will tell you , a blimp is an airship without an internal skeleton			0
these new airships have internal skeletons			0
but @entity3 loves the " b " word , so the company plans to keep calling them " blimps			1

for the first time in 45 years , @entity3 begins phasing in a new type of airship
*co-built* by @entity18 's @entity15 company , it 's faster and bigger and has a restroom
testing began in march , and the entire fleet will be zeppelins by 2018
although technically it 's not a blimp , @entity3 says it will still call it a blimp
