the 25 - year - old @entity9 batsman , who has played for his country , collapsed after he was struck by a " bouncer " from @entity13 bowler @entity12			1

he was eventually taken from the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) to the city 's @entity17			2
" @entity1 remains in a critical condition in intensive care			1
he 's in the hands of some of the best specialists available for this type of injury so we 'll just wait and see , " said hospital spokesman @entity21			2
the batsman underwent surgery on tuesday , immediately after the accident , and his family and members of his cricket team remained with him at the hospital , @entity21 added			1
@entity1 was " intubated " by medical staff who flew by helicopter to the ground			1
the procedure involves inserting a tube into the body to enable that person to breathe			2
however , the hospital would not confirm media reports that the player was in an induced coma			2
@entity1 was playing for @entity9 against @entity7 - based @entity13 , a team he represented between 2007 and 2012			1
" as you are aware @entity1 was hit and injured by a bouncer at the @entity16 this afternoon , " read a statement from @entity47			1
" he received immediate treatment at the ground led by @entity52 and @entity54 chief medical officer dr @entity53			2
he was then taken to hospital by ambulance and is receiving the best available care			2
" for privacy and accuracy reasons we are not in a position to discuss the medical details and we would be grateful if you would respect the privacy of the @entity1 family and all the players at this time			1
" players and staff from both @entity9 and @entity69 are obviously very concerned for @entity1 's health and , like @entity1 , are receiving appropriate support			1
" @entity1 grew up in @entity13 and is a @entity72 and is held in the highest regard by his current and former teammates			1
" the thoughts and prayers of all at @entity77 and indeed everyone in @entity2 cricket are with @entity80 for a speedy and full recovery			1
" ' freak accident ' @entity1 has played for his country in 26 test matches , most famously against @entity85 in 2013			1
he shared a record 10th - wicket partnership of 163 runs with teammate @entity88			2
after joining @entity89 in @entity85 in 2009 , @entity1 struck up a strong friendship with fellow batsman @entity91			1
@entity91 , who has represented @entity85 in nine @entity84 , was shocked to hear of his friend 's " freak accident			2
" " i feel sick , i feel devastated			2
i 'm sitting here with a former colleague of mine and we just feel a bit numb , " said @entity91 in a phone conversation with @entity0			2
" i 've sent messages ( to the family ) but it 's not a time when you want to get in the way			1
they 've got more important things to worry about			0
" everyone is supporting him , there are a lot of well wishers out there			0
it 's very difficult to know what the extent of the damage is			0
" @entity91 and @entity1 lived together in @entity117 during their time as @entity89 teammates			1
" we played together and got to know each other quite well , " explained @entity91			0
" we ended up living together in @entity123			0
he 's one of my best buddies , one of my best mates in the cricket			0
he 's a great guy , a fantastic batsman			0
" the " bouncer , " a delivery which is pitched short so it bounces up at the batsman 's upper body , is common tactic for bowlers to use in cricket			0
despite @entity1 ' accident , @entity91 does not think cricket has a problem with head protection			1
" it 's awkward , it 's part of the game			0
for the bowler , it 's not his fault			0
it 's one of those freak accidents , " said the 31 - year old			0
" on another day , you do exactly the same thing and it glances off your helmet , you get a bit of a bruise , you feel a bit ' ugh ' and that 's about it			0
every batsman has been hit at some point , some worse than others			0
" it 's the unpredictability of sport , that 's what makes it what it is			0
it 's a tough one to get right			0
if you want an absolutely risk - free occupation , do n't play sport			0
" the helmets these days are very well made			0
it 's hit him in an absolute freak place			0
" wickets harder , faster the hot , dry conditions of an @entity2 summer , explains @entity91 , create hard pitches , which suit fast bowlers			1
" watching the footage , him falling flat on his face , it 's not a nice image and it 's horrible to see			0
it 's probably more likely to happen in somewhere like @entity9 , where the wickets are harder and faster			1
" it 's a quick delivery that @entity1 's misjudged			1
everyone wears a helmet these days and it 's one of the risks of playing the sport			2
" we all play the game and millions have got through their careers without being hit , this was just a horrific accident			0
" the @entity195 is talking to @entity54 about arranging counseling for anyone affected by the incident .			0
