@entity2 can not confirm the authenticity of the videos			2
in a number of other cities across @entity1 , citizen journalists captured cell - phone videos of protesters scattering en masse as sounds of gunshots erupted and white smoke swept over the streets			1
in @entity34 , a coastal city in @entity35 , one man shouted , " serious injuries , tear gas			2
" another person died friday of injuries suffered in another demonstration a couple of days ago , bringing the day 's death count to 11 , according to the @entity43 - based @entity42			2

one person injured in @entity52 in a demonstration a couple of days ago died of his injuries friday			2
until thursday , @entity2 has been barred from officially entering @entity1 and its reporting about events inside the country had been limited largely to what the network was able to piece together based on official government reports and accounts and videos posted on the @entity83			2
recently , the government granted access to @entity2 journalists , who arrived thursday in @entity1 , where they were assigned government " minders " to accompany them on video shoots			0
the minders said they had not received permission to take the journalists to the areas where protests were occurring			0
instead , they took the journalists to @entity0 ' historic old city , where their appearance on the streets prompted a crowd of a few dozen @entity1 to erupt into pro-government chants			1
posters and pictures of president @entity101 quickly materialized			1
the demonstrators raged against foreign powers , saying the unrest in @entity1 is the result of an international conspiracy -- one that includes the news media -- and is intended to bring down the regime			1
" we feel like the international media is conducting a world war against us , " said @entity111 , 67			0
" not a single outlet has broadcast a real image of what is happening			0
" government officials told @entity2 personnel that they were worried about the journalists ' safety with so many " armed gangs " fomenting unrest throughout the country			0
the government has blamed " armed gangs " in explaining its military crackdowns , which have led thousands of @entity1 to cross into @entity126			1
the @entity130 governor 's office in @entity126 said friday that at least 11,739 @entity1 have done so			1
the state - run @entity45 said 500 displaced people have returned home			1
a supporter of the @entity1 government said friday that even those who have fled are part of a scheme to smear the government			0
" i refuse to call them refugees ; they are hostages taken to bring down the regime , " said @entity139 , her voice shaking with emotion			1
" we are with the regime			1
" rumors are rife , with some saying that the anti-government demonstrators have been sprayed with poisoned water that makes them more aggressive ; that terrorists are killing protesters and blaming the security forces			0
as more violence unfolded in @entity1 , the @entity154 condemned the nation friday , saying the " regime is calling its legitimacy into question " by opting for a " path of repression instead of fulfilling its own promises on broad reforms			1
" the @entity154 -- comprising the heads of state of @entity166 member states -- deplored the " ongoing repression and unacceptable and shocking violence the @entity1 regime continues to apply against its own citizens			1
" it also expressed grave concern about reports of @entity1 military activity near the @entity126 border at @entity175 and urged " maximum restraint			1
" this comes after the @entity178 voted thursday to expand sanctions against @entity1 by freezing the assets of seven people and four businesses with connections to the regime			1
the detail was published in the @entity166 's @entity185 on friday , and @entity187 foreign secretary @entity186 hailed the measures			1
" these measures are carefully targeted and focused on those responsible for violent repression , " @entity186 said			0
" contrary to the @entity1 authorities ' claims , the economic problems @entity1 is facing are a direct and predictable consequence of the @entity1 authorities ' decision to choose repression over reform			0
" among those sanctioned were three commanders in @entity204 's @entity203 accused of helping the " regime suppress protests " and " providing equipment and support " to the government , according to the @entity166 @entity185			1
one of the three is @entity210			0
@entity212 , the corps ' general commander			0
" i welcome the inclusion of three @entity204 individuals on the list , " @entity186 said			0
" the @entity204 government 's provision of equipment and technical advice to help suppress peaceful protests is absolutely unacceptable			0
@entity204 's actions are in stark contrast to the will of the @entity1 people			2
they also highlight again @entity204 's blatant hypocrisy , claiming publicly to support freedom in the @entity230 world , while privately assisting in violent repression			0
" two of those sanctioned were first cousins of the president			0
they are @entity235 , head of presidential security , and @entity238 , director of the military housing establishment			0
two others were business associates of @entity241 , the president 's brother and commander of the army 's @entity245 and " strongman of the @entity248			0
" @entity241 was among 23 @entity1 officials sanctioned by the @entity166 in may , and he is regarded as the principal overseer of the crackdown against protesters			1
others sanctioned at that time were the president ; @entity256 , the head of @entity1 's general intelligence directorate ; and @entity259 , the @entity1 businessman and cousin and confidant of the president			0
anti-government protests have raged in @entity1 for more than three months , with demonstrations gaining momentum amid a tough government crackdown			0
the number of estimated deaths has exceeded 1,600 , @entity59 said , with 1,316 civilians and 341 soldiers and security forces killed			2
