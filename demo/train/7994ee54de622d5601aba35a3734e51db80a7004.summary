-- at first glance , they could almost pass for masterpieces by @entity4 or @entity5			1
but these impressionist - style paintings -- which are changing hands for thousands of dollars -- were painted by a five - year - old girl who is unable to speak			1
meet @entity9 , an autistic child from @entity10 , @entity11 , who has been producing these striking artworks since she was three			1
she has autism , a condition that has made her unable to communicate except through the medium of art. " from the first painting , she filled the paper with color and it was n't random -- it was considered and thought out , " says her mother , @entity17			1
" she was so excited and happy i knew that we had found a key into her world and a way of interacting with her			2
" @entity29 changed everything the journey started when @entity9 was two			1
@entity32 and her husband , @entity34 - @entity33 , realized that something was wrong : she had not picked up any words , and rarely made eye contact			2
" we researched it ourselves , " her mother recalls , " but as parents , you are always hoping that there was some other explanation			2
" @entity9 was officially diagnosed as a child with autism			1
according to @entity32 , the doctor was " depressing " because he told them that very few therapies worked			0
not to be deterred , the couple embarked on " long nights of research " , which led them to the idea of art therapy			0
the little girl picked up painting techniques astonishingly quickly , and before long was spending much time at work on her canvases			2
remarkably for a child of her age , her sessions involved about two hours of consistent concentration			2
how one girl 's talent captured the world to begin with , @entity32 , who is a photographer herself , started sharing her daughter 's paintings on @entity71			1
the overwhelming response from her friends convinced her that she had n't been blinded by mother 's pride			0
fast forward two years , and @entity9 ' paintings are in high demand , and are starting to be worth a lot of money			1
due to the high level of demand for @entity9 ' art , her mother has set up a website to sell both originals and prints			1
it was a runaway success , quickly attracting over a million pageviews from more than 200 countries			0
" all profits from the originals go into @entity9 's savings account , " says @entity32			1
" we also sell cards and prints , and the profits from those go towards her speech therapy , occupational therapy , music and yoga			2
" the money generated from sales of the prints has had profoundly beneficial effects on @entity9 ' day - to - day life			1
according to @entity32 , systems like @entity109 speech therapy , for instance , have made an immeasurable difference to her ability to communicate			0
" she has a tendency to drift off into her own world , if you let her , " says @entity32			2
" so by using her interests , we manage to engage her , and she changes into a giggly little girl dancing around the house			0
" her speech is n't at a stage yet where we can have conversations , so it 's hard to tell exactly how much she is understanding everything that has happened surrounding her art. " we have shielded her from a lot of it			0
she has n't been to tv studios or done interviews			0
" @entity129 artworks many of @entity9 ' paintings show an astonishingly mature interpretation of natural scenes , including waterfalls , fields and skies			1
her abstracts often depict particular moods or experiences after which they are titled , like @entity140 , @entity141 , and @entity142			0
all are united by a distinctively contemplative and often lightly melancholy atmosphere , as well as a mysterious sense of depth			0
this growing body of work has led to @entity9 being widely accepted as a savant			1
according to professor @entity151 from the @entity152 at the @entity153 , people like @entity9 are able to unlock the hidden wells of potential that lie in all of us , but are rarely accessed			1
" i think it 's possible for a perfectly normal person to have access to these abilities , " he says			0
" [ but ] savants ca n't usually tell us how they do what they do			0
it just comes to them			0
" how fonts can help you find the perfect date the ' catholic witchdoctors ' of @entity169 how fonts could help you find the perfect date how some whisky lovers are now making millions			0
