-- the global center of gravity for aeronautics has undergone dramatic shifts over the past 110 years			0
prior to @entity5 dominated aviation with transatlantic zeppelins , high - speed seaplanes and jet engine research			1
post-war , the @entity10 tookover in commercial jet transport as they engaged in an arms race with the @entity14 during the @entity15			0
since the fall of the @entity18 , @entity16 has staged a revival in commercial air transport , with @entity21 and @entity22 battling for airliners			0
but as economic power shifts to the @entity26 , will we see the emergence of a new @entity28 or @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity31 or @entity32 ? the desire to build up an indigenous aerospace industry is easily understood			1
it provides highly - skilled , well - paid jobs and requires a large industrial supply chain			1
prestige and international respect are an added bonus			1
more importantly , in the military sphere an aerospace industry assures that a nation can develop , build , operate and maintain the most advanced military equipment itself			1
aerospace is also a lucrative business providing advanced technology products that command a premium			1
with giant orders from fast - growing @entity53 budget airlines @entity54 and @entity55 demonstrate , the potential is huge			1
made in @entity56 one @entity58 nation forging a path is @entity56			1
after national champion @entity61 began in regional aircraft and military coin aircraft , it has now successfully broken into the business jet market -- even to the extent of opening a factory in @entity67			1
it will follow @entity21 and @entity22 in launching a re-engined version of its @entity71 airliner family			0
but it has big ambitions , too , in military aerospace -- its @entity76 transport aims to replace the @entity77 as the jet - powered standard military transport			1
meanwhile , its @entity81 light attack aircraft was selected by the @entity10 for supply to the @entity83 -- a key achievement			0
@entity86 's drones elsewhere , @entity86 too has big plans -- although these revolve around military aerospace projects			2
it has a joint project with @entity91 to build stealth fighters and is also planning to develop its own stealth unmanned drone			0
however , despite its success in producing engineers and a vibrant it sector -- it has struggled with indigenous aircraft programs			0
@entity86 's previous national fighter project , the @entity101 , suffered from a lack of a suitable engine			2
an even simpler light 14 - seat commuter prototype , the @entity105 , crashed in 2009			2
nevertheless , joint turboprop transport projects with @entity91 suggest that @entity86 is not likely to give up just yet			0
infographic : the state of global aviation military aircraft - a @entity14 legacy ? @entity91 , too , provides a paradox			1
an aerospace technology leader in the @entity15 , it has skilled workers and access to advanced research centers -- especially in aerodynamics			2
its proven @entity120 rocket remains the only way the astronauts of any nation can get to the @entity124			0
but while it still remains a military aircraft powerhouse and exporter , its commercial success has been patchy			0
@entity91 's latest @entity129 , despite help from @entity132 partners , seems unlikely to break out fully into the wider market beyond @entity135 nations			0
a follow on single - aisle airliner , the @entity136 is destined to go up against the dominant @entity139 and @entity141 @entity140 civil aviation in @entity143 finally , there is @entity143 -- a country with massive ambitions to propel itself into the top league of aerospace nations			1
in the past couple of years , analysts have seen an endless parade of once secret @entity143 military aircraft revealed : two stealth fighter prototypes , attack helicopters , a four - engine military transport , various @entity156 and the latest -- a stealthy attack drone			2
the country also has ambitions in civil aerospace -- however development of its previous airliner , the @entity158 , which first flew in 2008 , is proceeding at a glacial pace			2
it is only likely to be used by @entity143 or close allies of @entity166			0
its latest prestige civil airliner project is the single - aisle @entity169 -- which contains a high proportion of @entity173 systems and equipment			1
first flight is expected in 2014 and @entity143 is hoping that this aircraft could gain it a foothold in the wider international market			2
indeed in the past two years both @entity179 and @entity180 signed agreements to help develop this airliner			0
could a western airline order be the big civil breakthrough for @entity143 ? aviation shifts @entity186 and there are other challenges , too , for countries attempting to enter the highly competitive aerospace sector			1
high quality support and service of aircraft ( both military and civil ) means that manufacturers now need a global network of agents , service centers and aftermarket facilities to cater to demanding customers			2
in some respects it may actually be easier to put a human into space , than create a worldwide commercial airliner business from scratch			0
in short , there are signs that aerospace , like other industries , is undergoing a seismic shift eastwards			0
this is where the biggest passenger market will be			0
there will be many obstacles for those wanting to join this elite club but not all will make it			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity222 .			1

@entity222 is an aviation expert and the editor - in - chief of @entity226 *magazine*
@entity58 countries are attempting to enter the elite club of aerospace manufacturers
national aerospace industry creates skills , jobs , international prestige , says @entity222
