first lady @entity3 's drive to stop a @entity5 - led effort to slow adoption of nutrition standards for school meals , a centerpiece of her anti-obesity " @entity0 " campaign , was dealt a setback in @entity12			1
democrats aligned with mrs. @entity3 on the issue failed on thursday to strip the proposal from a $ 142.5 billion @entity17 spending bill , which was approved by the @entity18 and sent to the @entity19 for consideration			1
the controversial plan offered by rep. @entity22 of @entity23 would give schools struggling financially an extra year to comply with rules approved by @entity12 in 2010 to limit fat and salt and promote fruits , vegetables and whole grains			1
" i want to be clear that everybody supports healthy lunches and meals for children , but the bottom line is the schools are finding the regulations to be too much too quick , " @entity22 said during consideration of the measure by the appropriations panel			2
" school districts need more time to implement the changes			2
" an amendment proposed by @entity13 rep. @entity44 of @entity45 to strip @entity22 's language from the bill failed 29 - 22 on a party line vote			1
" it gives schools an opt - out saying you do n't have to participate in the school lunch program cause it 's hard			1
well , we do n't tell kids , ' look you do n't have to take math if it 's hard or science if it 's hard			0
you do n't have do @entity62 if it 's hard , ' " @entity44 said			0
" this opt out for nutrition is just the wrong way to go particularly at this moment in @entity69 history when we 're really trying to figure out how we can raise a healthier society , " @entity44 said			0
mrs. @entity3 's strong pushback on a legislative issue marks a rare political foray			0
she has promoted healthy eating and exercise through her @entity78 garden and her " @entity0 " campaign for years , but she has never previously inserted herself so deeply into a congressional debate			1
she has taken a public stance on the bill and urged @entity13 , health advocates and ordinary people to fight the waiver and other proposed changes to nutrition programs			1
" remember a few years ago when @entity12 declared that the sauce on a slice of pizza should count as a vegetable in school lunches ? " she wrote in an opinion piece published in the @entity94 on thursday			2
" you do n't have to be a nutritionist to know that this does n't make much sense			0
yet , we 're seeing the same thing happening again with these new efforts to lower nutrition standards in our schools			1
our children deserve so much better than this , " she said			0
mrs. @entity3 hosted a roundtable on school meals on tuesday and an off - the - record conference call with advocates last week , and her office says she is not backing down on this issue			2
@entity44 hopes the waiver language can ultimately be defeated in the @entity19			0
similar legislation in the @entity115 does not include the waiver language			0
if it survives a @entity19 vote and the @entity115 approves its version of agriculture spending without it , then the two chambers would have to resolve the issue through negotiation .			0
