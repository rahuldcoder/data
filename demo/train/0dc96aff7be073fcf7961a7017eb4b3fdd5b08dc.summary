reform , an @entity71 evangelical network that has opposed the introduction of women bishops , warned that @entity34 's appointment would strain relations in the diocese			1

" though it grieves us , it comes as no surprise			2
we pray that the @entity86 will uphold the promises made in july and enable the many thriving conservative evangelical churches in his @entity89 to continue to serve their communities with theological integrity under the oversight of a male bishop			2
