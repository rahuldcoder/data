@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 says there is only one person he blames for the spectacular implosion of his career the first time round -- himself			1
@entity3 backstage at the @entity9 holding his @entity10 for his portrayal of @entity12 in " @entity12			1
" " you lose your house , your wife , your career , your everything at one time , " he says , " you 've got to look in the mirror and go ' it 's your fault			1
' " for a long time it looked like @entity3 was destined for obscurity			1
but , amazingly , he has battled his way back to the top			1
it has taken him 15 years , but his critically - acclaimed role in @entity27 's latest film , " @entity12 " might finally allow the actor to shake off the notoriety and grab on to the career that should have been his all along			1
@entity3 's recent @entity9 win for best actor seems to be just another chapter in the actor 's strange roller coaster story			1
despite early promise , @entity3 gained such a terrible reputation for self - destructive behavior and on - set antics that , no one in @entity41 would touch him			1
he has also been beset by public mistakes and scandal : his ruined face , the arrests and alleged spousal abuse , a short stint as a boxer and some terrible career choices -- he turned down the role of prize - fighter @entity51 in " @entity53 " which was eventually played by @entity54			1
today , a relaxed , expansive @entity3 is sitting in sweats in a private room at an exclusive @entity1 hotel that is thick with cigarette smoke			1
the face , battered during his short boxing career and reconstructed with extensive plastic surgery , is , unexpectedly , less of a train wreck in the flesh , although his moustache does look distinctly stuck - on			1
his ever - present pet @entity65 , @entity67 , is also there , slumbering quietly by @entity3 's side in a tiny gray hooded top			1
( in his @entity9 acceptance speech , he thanked his dogs saying , " sometimes when a man is alone , that 's all you 've got is your dog			1
" ) squashed on top of his scarecrow hair extensions is a beanie with the word " indestructible " embroidered across the front			2
it 's not a bad description for the 52 - year - old actor			2
candid is another one -- especially about the bad times			0
" seeing your entourage leaving with everything they can carry			0
" he says , giving an example of a particularly bleak time , " and you 're standing there in the dark with your thumb up your ass			0
" it is the uncomfortable parallels between the ups and downs of @entity3 's life and that of his character @entity12 -- a burnt - out fighter , once a crowd - puller , now scraping a living from second division fights in school gyms -- that give particular resonance to the role			1
" there was so much of the character ... living in shame , the character being a has - been , it was like it hit me in the face really hard , " he tells @entity2			2
he says he also knew director @entity27 would " want his pound of flesh			0
" " i knew he 'd want me to revisit some very dark painful places			0
" things started to go wrong for @entity3 in 1987 , at the height of his fame after explicit blockbuster " 9 1/2 weeks			2
" he says simply that he lost interest in acting and preferred riding motorcycles			0
but it was more than that			0
@entity132 , who directed @entity3 in 1987 film " @entity134 " is quoted as calling him " a nightmare " and " very dangerous on set			2
" @entity3 puts this down to a problem with authority -- for him " there were no rules " -- and an innate mistrust of the political side of @entity41			2
he says it could be to do with being abused by his father as a child			0
" you look at some other guy who 's making movies and they 're calling him a movie star or whatever and the guy ca n't , he ca n't carry your jockstrap			2
" because of my temperament and my upbringing i took it real personal and short - circuited			2
" whatever it was , @entity3 gave up acting and took up professional boxing for four years in the early 1990s and , it seems he was able to fully indulge his self - destructive streak			1
by the time doctors told him he must stop boxing , he was suffering from memory loss , poor balance and needed extensive plastic surgery to reconstruct his battered face			0
of course , @entity3 's scandals and problems would n't be half as interesting if it was n't for his prodigious talent			1
he was one of the last actors to train with the legendary @entity172 at the actor 's studio in @entity175 with @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity178 and @entity179			0
early roles had some comparing him to @entity181 and @entity177			0
he says he has spent the last 13 years going to therapy to deal with his issues -- not a natural place for an " old school guy			1
" " for me it would be easier to talk to a priest than a therapist , " he explains , " i was afraid that if i changed i would n't be a man			0
" but , he says he persevered and straightened out " some issues from my childhood			0
" he says he is now a changed man and is being welcomed back into the bosom of @entity41 : he is reprising his role as " @entity195 " in " @entity196 2 , " is lined up for a role in @entity199 's " @entity198 " and is in talks to play a villain in the upcoming blockbuster " @entity203 " -- his first major studio film since resurrecting his career			1
he 's still a bit edgy , though			0
even after all the years of therapy			2
he recently sparked up one of his beloved @entity209 during an interview and , then , of course , he called @entity212 a " homophobe , " as reported in the @entity213			0
does he ever worry he might throw it all away again ? " i 'll never lose it all again , " he says , " it was too much hard work to get it back and too lonely and too dark			0
" i 've worked too hard for it			0
it would be too hard to take			0

@entity3 has spent 15 years battling his way back to the top
after a promising start , he threw away his career with self - destructive behavior
@entity3 on losing everything : " you 've got to look in the mirror and go ' it 's your fault ' "
he has been in therapy for 13 years and says he was " afraid of change "
