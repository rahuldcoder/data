why was my son murdered ? he was 24 , and he had never tried drugs			1
he did n't even smoke			0
he had paid half his university costs with a sports scholarship and was working as administrative staff at a cardiac clinic in @entity7 , @entity8			2
why then was my son suffocated by hit men from the @entity10 ? why did his six friends , just like him , die at his side ? the answer , you may tell me , is obvious			1
" because drug traffickers are bad , and must be stopped			0
" the answer , however , is not that simple			0
if it were i would not be leading a caravan for peace across the @entity20			1
let 's pose the question differently			0
if @entity8 's president @entity25 had treated drug abuse as a question of public health rather than a matter of national security , might my son and his friends still be alive today ? if instead of declaring war on drug trafficking , @entity31 had pursued a bilateral agenda with the @entity20 to decriminalize drugs and regulate their use , is it possible that they and tens of thousands of other young people killed in the last six years would be still be with us ? declaring a war obliges one 's enemy to build up defensive armies			1
and if the principal tactic of that war is identifying and taking out crime syndicate leaders , it leaves their decapitated , but ever profitable , organizations adrift			0
president @entity25 went on the offensive against cartel " capos			0
" the result was a proliferation of criminal gangs			0
my son , @entity56 , and his friends were kidnapped , tortured and killed by one of those new splinter gangs , who did the hit for just $ 25,000 and two pickup trucks			1
why ? one of the young men killed with my son had complained about a theft in the valet parking of a bar that turned out to be managed by one of the criminal gangs untethered after drug lord @entity69 was killed and his lieutenants scattered			1
" @entity77 , " a former @entity69 confidante , was recently apprehended by authorities , telling his captors , " i was quite outraged when they murdered @entity76 's son and his friends			1
murdering innocent people is not our business			0
but i was fleeing , and i could not do anything			0
" the horrific story of my son and his friends is one of thousands like it in our country			2
more than 60,000 people have been killed and 20,000 have disappeared because of the myopic war strategy @entity25 and the @entity8 security forces have pursued since 2006			1
some murder estimates are even higher			0
that is why i stopped writing poetry and took to the streets with thousands of other grieving @entity8 to make my son , and other victims like him , visible			1
now , i 'm traveling across the @entity20 with members of dozens of families broken by violence to seek common cause with @entity20 whose communities , especially the @entity101 and @entity102 communities who have so warmly hosted us , that have been battered by the violence and the criminalization that this same counterproductive war inflicts on the @entity20 side of the border			1
poet 's pain over son 's cartel slaying leads to movement for peace the path of peace must be taken by both our nations in concert			1
we know that president @entity31 would not have declared his war without @entity20 sponsorship , money and military advice			2
drug traffickers would not be able to fight this war without the high - powered assault weapons which , legalized in the @entity20 , now flood over the @entity8 border			1
drug lords could not afford their wars without massive illegal drug profits and collusion by international banks to launder their money			0
forty - plus years after @entity20 president @entity136 declared the drug war , it is time to concede it has n't worked any more than alcohol prohibition worked back in the 1920s			1
this is why , after traveling in two caravans across @entity8 and , talking twice with president @entity25 on live television , our movement of war victims called for a caravan across the @entity20			1
we started in @entity147 on august 12th and we will end in @entity148 , on september 12th			2
with each mile traveled , we seek to raise awareness and spur the good conscience of the people of the @entity20 , while reframing the issues of war and peace on the bilateral agenda of @entity8 and the @entity20			1
we implore the governments of @entity8 and of the @entity20 to accept co-responsibility for ending the disastrous drug war			1
we 've been encouraged by the warmth and breadth of support we 've experienced on our journey , from thousands of @entity20 , including grieving moms who 've lost their children to drug addiction and top cops who have decided to speak out against the destruction wrought by prohibition			2
yet even as we are carried forward by the momentum of this fresh dialogue , another voice echoes			0
every time i close my eyes i see my son 's gaze moments before his death			2
he is afraid , very afraid , and behind his fear i hear a horrible question			0
" if drugs were legalized , and there were no weapons , would i be here , just about to die ? go , dad , leave all your things behind and tell everyone that this war is destroying more people than the drugs themselves			2
tell them that no prohibition is worth the death of any person			0
go tell them that we need to find peace , so that no other father will have to see his son die like this , and no son will again suffer what i am suffering			2
" this is why we have come to the @entity20			0
if we do not make peace together , we will never find it			0
follow @ @entity204 on @entity205 .			0
