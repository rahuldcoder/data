-- @entity1 is rumored to be making a phone			1
citing checks of the company 's supply chain , an analyst at @entity7 has issued a memo saying the phone may cost less than $ 200 and likely will be available in the middle of next year , according to multiple news reports in financial publications			1
" with the clear success of the @entity17 over the past 3 years , and @entity18 possibly succeeding in the low - priced tablet market , we view this as the next logical step for @entity1 , " the investor 's note said , according to a report in @entity15			2
the blog @entity23 says it 's likely the phone would run @entity27 's @entity26 operating system : " ( @entity30 ) @entity29 's note does n't spell out that the phone will use @entity27 's @entity26 operating system , but it suggests that will be the case by positing that @entity1 will need to pay @entity33 an ' os royalty ' -- @entity33 has recently been able to extract royalty payments from other @entity26 hardware partners			1
" of course , all of this is completely speculative , and based on one report from one analyst			0
@entity1 did not immediately respond to @entity0 's request for comment on friday morning , and no on knows for sure if the company is working on a phone			1
but it 's interesting to tech journalists and investors in part because @entity1 is creeping further from its roots as an e-commerce website and into new areas of technology , including hardware development			2
the company 's @entity18 e-reader has been a hit for years , and @entity1 this week put its new tablet , the @entity18 , on the market for $ 200			2
reviewers say the @entity18 is n't amazing -- not as functional as the @entity61 -- but they 're generally impressed with it given its much - lower price			0
the @entity65 @entity61 sells for $ 500 to $ 830			0
the @entity1 phone would cost the company $ 150 to $ 170 to make , and @entity1 -- always one to offer low prices , even when it loses money on a sale -- likely would offer the phone for close to that price , @entity66 writes at @entity23			1
still , all of this buzz about an @entity1 phone raises a larger question : would you want to buy it ? this is completely anecdotal , but when @entity82 , a @entity84 tech columnist , asked this question of his followers on @entity87 he got back plenty of " no 's			1
" some of the responses from his followers : " i do n't even know how well their tablet works , much less an os for the phone			0
" " no. " " something that belongs on + the @entity100 news network : ) " " @entity1 is going in the wrong direction			2
" others were more enthusiastic , if the price is right			0
" $ 150 with no contract required would be an awesome deal , especially for the 40 % or so of people that do n't have a smart phone			0
my father in law wants an @entity112 but not the data plan fee			0
