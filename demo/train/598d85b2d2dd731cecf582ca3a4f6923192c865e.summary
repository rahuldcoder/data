-- after 40 years of appearing on the silver screen , actor @entity1 is the elder statesman of @entity4 cinema and is possibly the most recognized man in @entity4			1
the @entity1 : the patriarch of @entity4 cinema has appeared in over 180 films			1
born to a famous @entity4 poet , @entity1 made his screen debut at the age of 27 and has gone on to star in over 180 films			1
as such an established star he has seen @entity4 film making change over the years , weathered changing audience tastes and the evolution of @entity17 cinema			1
" i 'm actually very happy with our content			2
even though we were ridiculed , and the @entity20 were very cynical about the way we made our films and the content that it contained , " he told @entity0			2
" but that very aspect has now become its @entity26 ( unique selling point ) almost , and people love to see that			2
i would not want to change that			0
i would expect that this is how and what our cinema is all about			1
" if @entity4 films have gained a new found international interest , the way that @entity4 films are produced has also changed			1
from the industry 's alleged connection to organized crime to better production quality , @entity1 has worked within the system and at the sharp end of making movies			1
" we have our own modes of working and how does one actually decipher that the person that you 're working with has some kind of an underground link ? you know , ' i am mafia ' does n't come written on somebody 's forehead			0
" whether he , you know , collects his money from wherever it is ... is really not our concern			0
we are interested the story , the concept , in our roles , the director who 's going to be making it , in the creative aspect			0
that 's it , " he said			0
the role that propelled him to superstardom was of a working class hero standing up to oppression and injustice in the 1975 film " @entity73 "			1
" during the 1970s there was a feeling of great dissatisfaction in the youth that the establishment of the system is not doing enough to take care of their issues and problems			2
when one individual stood out and challenged the system and came out victorious he suddenly became a hero , " he told @entity0			0
" i fortunately happened to be the actor that they chose to represent that kind of philosophy or thinking			2
and therefore i became a beneficiary			0
" from being the " angry young man " of cinema in @entity4 he is now more commonly known as " the @entity1 " to the media and his millions of fans			1
but being such a public figure has never been a problem ; @entity1 writes a daily blog and believes that it 's in an actor 's make - up to thrive in public attention and that stars should be able to deal with praise as well as criticism			1
" i think we all live to be recognized ... creativity would be useless if no one ever saw it or recognized it			0
we want our work to be known			0
" i enjoy my blog greatly because i invite comment			0
not all of them are complimentary , many of them are abusive , but i never moderate it because i think it 's important to know what the rest of the world actually thinks about you			0
" taking the good with the bad , @entity1 was recently criticized for reportedly being less than impressed by @entity126 's @entity125 - winning film , " @entity127			1
" but says @entity1 the unnecessary controversy was because of comments from readers on his blog had been mistakenly attributed to him			1
" i was wrongly accused			0
i did get to see the film			2
i thought it was a very well made film , great story , " he told @entity0			1
if " @entity127 " illustrates current interest in @entity4 films by the @entity20 , @entity4 movies have also developed in ways more familiar to @entity140 movies			1
" life has become a lot faster			0
we 've had to move with the times and adjust			0
if you were to analyze an indie film of the 1970s ... there would be far , far less editing cuts of , say , a film that was released in 2009			2
that philosophy [ from tv editing ] , for some peculiar reason , has now translated into the minds of the audiences and they expect the same kind of treatment when they go out to see a movie , " he told @entity0 .			0
