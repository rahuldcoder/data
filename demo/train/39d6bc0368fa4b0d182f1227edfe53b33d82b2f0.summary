-- a @entity3 newspaper removed an interactive map from its website following a public outcry over the revealing of names and addresses of handgun permit holders in @entity12 and @entity13 counties , the publisher said friday			1
the newspaper last month defended the online information culled from public records , but @entity17 publisher @entity16 on friday said the map had served its purpose			1
the database was published in the wake of the elementary school massacre in @entity23 , @entity24 , where 20 children and six adults were killed			0
the gunman , 20 , had earlier killed his mother in their home ; he killed himself after the school rampage			0
" today @entity17 has removed the permit data from lohud.com , " @entity16 said in a public letter on the website			1
the newspaper was n't caving to public pressure , and the decision was n't an acknowledgment that it made a mistake , @entity16 said			1
in fact , she said , many community members applauded publication of the permit data			2
" our decision to do so is not a concession to critics that no value was served by the posting of the map in the first place , " @entity16 said			1
" nor is our decision made because we were intimidated by those who threatened the safety of our staffers			0
we know our business is a controversial one , and we do not cower , " @entity16 said			2
after map published , blogger posts journalists ' address " but the database has been public for 27 days and we believe those who wanted to view it have done so already			2
as well , with the passage of time , the data will become outdated and inaccurate , " she said			0
@entity16 acknowledged a legislative climate in @entity3 that favors making private any information about gun permits			2
" as a news organization , we are constantly defending the public 's right to know , " she said			0
" but we are not deaf to voices who have said that new rules should be set for gun permit data			1
" the online map allowed readers to zoom in on red dots that indicated which residents were licensed to own pistols or revolvers			1
blue dots indicated permit holders who " have purchased a firearm or updated the information on a permit in the past five years			1
" the published data outraged many gun permit holders and privacy advocates , who posted angry comments online			1
some threatened to cancel their subscriptions or boycott the publication			0
at the time , @entity16 defended the decision			0
" one of our roles is to report publicly available information on timely issues , even when unpopular			0
we knew publication of the database ( as well as the accompanying article providing context ) would be controversial , but we felt sharing information about gun permits in our area was important in the aftermath of the @entity23 shootings , " she said last month			2
on friday , the newspaper pledged to continue " to report aggressively " on gun ownership and will press its request for data from @entity114 and additional information from @entity12 and @entity13 counties once it 's released publicly			1
" and we will keep a snapshot of our map -- with all its red dots -- on our website to remind the community that guns are a fact of life we should never forget , " @entity16 wrote			0
@entity0 's @entity126 and @entity127 contributed to this report .			0
