-- the @entity2 @entity1 has a lot to boast about			1
the country has beautiful beaches , great scuba diving and a culture that is known for its hospitality			2
what it does n't have is a lot of money for a global tourism campaign			0
thankfully , the country 's social media mad population is happy to help			1
in january , the government launched a campaign with the tagline " it 's more fun in the @entity2 , " openly inviting the country 's bloggers , tweeters and @entity25 friends to come up with their own ads. " we just opened another battlefront , which was the social media side and tapping into the fact that there are 27 million @entity2 on @entity25 , " says campaign creator @entity29			1
within hours # itsmorefuninthephilippines became the number one trending item on @entity38			0
facebook pages filled with homemade ads popped up , exclaiming everything from " @entity42 , more fun in the @entity2 , " to " @entity44 , more fun in the @entity2			1
" @entity47 was one of many @entity2 who seized on the campaign with delight , creating his own @entity25 album of ads. within 24 hours , his work was shared by over 10,000 people			1
he says the democratic nature of the campaign inspired him			0
" usually it 's top down , " he says			0
" the government does something and we just sit there passively reacting to it and voicing our opinions			0
here it was n't that way			0
we actually made the ads. " read more : why @entity2 tourism is a tough sell the use of crowd - sourcing did mean that not all the ads stuck to the positive messages the government hoped to convey			1
ads sprung up with slogans like " poverty , more fun in the @entity2 , " and " corruption , more fun in the @entity2			1
" " there is no way with a genuine people 's campaign that you can control everything that people are going to say and everything is going to be the way you 'd like it to be , " says @entity29			0
still he feels the positive reception for the campaign has overwhelmed the negative			0
tourism numbers to the @entity2 are rising , though the country does have a long way to go			2
fewer than four million people visited the country last year , compared with 19 million to @entity95 and the industry has yet to become a tent pole for the broader economy			1
however visitor arrivals were up nearly 16 % in the first two months of this year			2
one of the @entity2 ' greatest battles in attracting tourists will continue to be its poor infrastructure			1
roads and airports across the country are in need of a major upgrade and tourists ' complaints range from hassles with dishonest taxi drivers to less than savory toilets			2
the current government has said it is committed to upgrading the country 's tourism infrastructure , allocating a chuck of money towards the cause in the 2012 budget			0
those involved in the travel industry says such government support is necessary if the country wants to fully capitalize on the buzz from its tourism campaign			0
after all , it 's one thing to promise people " more fun in the @entity2 " but another thing to deliver it .			2

the @entity2 attracted around 4 million tourists last year
@entity95 attracted 19 million visitors during the same *period*
social media a huge help to promoting the @entity2 as *holiday* *destination*
