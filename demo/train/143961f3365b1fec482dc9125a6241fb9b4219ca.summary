-- what 's with this wacky weather ? it 's so cold in @entity4 that farmers joke the oranges are squeezing themselves to stay warm			1
but @entity7 is so warm that a ski resort 's been forced to close			1
add to this curious mix , giant waves in @entity11 , a historic drought in @entity13 , and bears coming out of hibernation in @entity15 , and you ca n't help but wonder : what is going on with the weather ? to be sure , the @entity20 is a giant place -- 3,000 miles wide from coast to coast			1
but even taking that into account , what you have here has to be at least a tad bit out of the norm			1
right ? " it 's not actually that unusual , " says @entity30 , a meteorologist with the @entity31 at the @entity32			1
usually a few times each winter , the temperatures flip - flop where @entity36 is colder than @entity37			1
" but , " he says , " this one is more persistent than we normally see			2
" @entity41 : @entity42 bowled this whole weather system business is a balancing act			2
" when there 's extremely cold air in one area , some other part is going to be warm , " says @entity30			2
tell that to the folks in the @entity41 who are still digging out from more than a foot of snow in some places and shivering with temperatures in the single digits -- a full 15 to 25 degrees below normal			1
on tuesday , 10 inches of snow fell on @entity57 , which hosts the @entity58 in 10 days			1
it gave @entity61 officials a chance to test their snow removal plan , affiliate @entity59 reported			1
@entity61 officials say it will take 1,600 workers about 18 hours to clear the stadium and parking lots			2
" the stadium operations staff along with @entity61 productions staff is running this as a dress rehearsal and we have people watching , and evaluating and grading , " said @entity61 executive vice president @entity69			2
dropping the ( snow ) ball on game day would be bad pr for the league			1
about 111 million @entity20 watched last year 's game			1
the extended forecast is n't providing much to be optimistic about though			1
" the way the pattern is set up right now , there will be a series of cold air shots , " @entity30 said			2
" the basic pattern is going to stay this way for another week or so			2
" @entity7 : hit the ski ( d ) s contrast that with @entity37 , @entity7 , where thursday 's forecast high will be around 45 degrees			1
a typical high would be in the low 20s			2
the seven - day forecast holds more of the same			2
temperatures like that are bad news for the @entity100 which closed for the third time this winter			2
@entity103 fell wednesday on an empty parking lot			0
" sometimes you get epic storms			0
if this was 10 degrees cooler , it would be one of those , " @entity107 , the owner of @entity108 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity109 , trying to sound hopeful " we will get snow and it will be fine			1
" @entity11 : making waves waves up to 50 feet high have been pounding the @entity117 of @entity118 -- the largest @entity11 's seen since 2004			0
" it 's a spectacle			0
it 's incredible , " resident @entity120 said			0
" it 's so big and massive and powerful and it 's really a special thing to watch for sure			0
" what 's causing it ? a large storm with hurricane - force winds that 's sending a giant swell toward the island			1
the surf peaked overnight , the weather service said			0
great news for surfers , right ? not quite			0
at first glance , the tall waves would appear to offer a golden opportunity for participants in a big wave surf contest that was scheduled to take place wednesday on @entity118			0
but the organizers have postponed the event			0
they say that although the waves are expected to be pleasingly large , the wind conditions are no good			1
@entity13 : no rain on the ranches winter is @entity13 's wet season			1
it 's the dead of winter now , but there no cloud in sight and nary a raindrop in the forecast			0
@entity13 's facing perhaps its worst drought since record - keeping began a century ago , @entity13 gov. @entity155 proclaimed this month			0
it 's pushed farmers and ranchers to their financial limits			0
there 's nothing on the ground for animals to eat			0
" i borrowed money -- i hate to even say that -- but i recently borrowed money to buy hay , " says rancher @entity169			0
" normally , it 'd be raining and we 'd have grass growing , " he says			0
" the grass is basically all gone			0
" @entity15 : barely sleeping an unusual number of black bears are up and about in western @entity15			1
the winter there has been so abnormally warm and dry winter that the bears are done with their hibernation and headed out for food			0
the @entity32 's forecast for @entity184 , @entity15 , for instance , calls for high temperatures heading to or well past 50 degrees for the next week at least , with nary of snow flurry in sight			1
it 's not just @entity15 : nearby @entity13 is also seeing an abnormal number of black bears , with @entity0 affiliate @entity192 showing images taken from @entity194 and @entity196 's @entity195			0
@entity197 said " a disastrous winter " -- adding " we need the snow " -- and relatively mild temperatures have thrown off some black bears			1
" we documented this and , in the past 15 years , it occurs sporadically , " the spokesman said			1
" a lot of it is dictated by the weather conditions			0
" and , as we know , this year it 's been all kinds of weird			0
@entity0 's @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215 contributed to this report .			0
