@entity0 -- with his visit already bogged down in historical disputes , the pope 's message of peace in @entity5 was interrupted monday by an impromptu speaker who fueled the longtime resentment between @entity10 and @entity11			1
pope @entity12 , left , with @entity11 president @entity13 at @entity14 near @entity15 monday			1
after pope @entity12 , speaking to religious leaders during an interfaith discussion in @entity18 , called for mutual understanding and cooperation in the tumultuous region , @entity22 , chief of @entity24 courts in the @entity25 and @entity5 , commandeered the microphone and began to criticize @entity11 in @entity27			1
he was not scheduled to speak at the event at the @entity29 of @entity30			0
the @entity11 government condemned @entity22 's remarks , in which he called on @entity33 and @entity34 to work together against @entity11			1
" it is regrettable that [ @entity22 ] has abused an interreligious meeting aimed at promoting dialogue and understanding between @entity34 , jews and @entity33 , in order to incite against @entity11 , " a statement from the @entity36 said			2
in his unscheduled remarks , @entity22 said , " we struggle together and we suffer together from the injustice of the @entity11 occupation and its oppressive practices , and we look forward to freedom and independence			2
" he also criticized @entity11 's @entity25 separation barrier as the " racist wall , " saying it turned the @entity10 territory into " a giant prison and keeps @entity33 and @entity34 from praying in their churches and mosques			1
" " his holiness the pope , i call on you in the name of the one @entity61 to condemn these crimes and pressure the @entity11 government to stop its aggression against the @entity10 people , " @entity22 said			1
it was not clear whether the pope understood @entity22 's comments , and he did not react			2
some in the audience clapped but many appeared uncomfortable			0
the latin patriarch , @entity70 , walked across the stage and tapped @entity22 on the hand as he implored him to stop			0
@entity22 finished the speech after 10 minutes and sat down			0
tourism minister @entity74 , who oversaw the pontiff 's visit to @entity11 , said @entity22 's words planted " seeds of division " between @entity11 and @entity10 , as well as between @entity41 , @entity33 and @entity34			1
" the sheikh 's provocation hurt , first and foremost , pope @entity12 , who came to the @entity83 to promote peace and unity between the peoples of the region and all persons of faith , " @entity74 said in a statement			1
the rev. @entity90 of @entity18 's @entity91 , who is involved in the church 's interfaith efforts , said " it was shameful and disgraceful			0
@entity95 betrayed the trust of the people who invited him to this gathering			0
" the @entity100 offered a statement , saying @entity22 's remarks were " a direct negation " of the peaceful purpose of the dialogue			0
" we hope that such an incident will not damage the mission of the pope aiming at promoting peace and also interreligious dialogue , as he has clearly affirmed in many occasions during this pilgrimage , " the @entity100 said			2
during the discussion at the @entity30 , the pope encouraged religious leaders to proclaim what their faiths have in common , " since many are quick to point out the readily apparent differences between religions			0
" earlier in the day , pope @entity12 gave a speech at the residence of @entity11 president @entity13 , urging @entity11 and @entity10 to find a " just resolution " to their long - running conflict monday as he arrived in @entity11			1
" i plead with all those responsible to explore every possible avenue , " the pope said , " so that both peoples may live in peace in a homeland of their own , within secure and internationally recognized borders			2
" he cited the biblical prophet @entity133 on the meaning of " security " -- a justification @entity11 often uses for its actions against @entity10			1
" @entity139 [ in @entity140 ] -- arises from trust and refers not just to the absence of threat but also to the sentiment of calmness and confidence , " the pope said			0
and while @entity22 's remarks immediately drew outrage in the region , problems plagued the pope 's visit even before the pontiff arrived in @entity18 -- including an @entity11 - @entity10 dispute over the location of the press center for the trip			1
@entity10 officials set up an alternative press center , arguing that the @entity159 , the site of the official one , was linked to @entity11 's policy of demolishing @entity10 homes built without permission in @entity18			1
both sides claim the neighborhood			0
@entity11 police shut down the alternative press center , according to police spokesman @entity169 , on the grounds that the @entity171 was not allowed to host events in @entity18			0
once in @entity11 , the pope managed to address another controversy from months before			2
he made a reference monday to the @entity176 , an issue that made trouble for the @entity178 earlier this year when @entity12 rehabilitated an excommunicated bishop who had disputed the number of @entity41 killed in concentration camps during @entity182 his excommunication was unrelated to his @entity176 denial			1
" it is right and fitting that during my stay in @entity11 that i will have the opportunity to honor the memory of the 6 million @entity41 victims of the @entity176 , " the pope said monday , using the @entity140 word for the @entity176			2
" and to pray that humanity will never again witness a crime of such magnitude			0
" the pope said @entity196 is " totally unacceptable " and pointedly rejected @entity176 denial as he visited @entity198 , @entity11 's holocaust memorial			1
he clutched a small cross and bowed his head in front of the eternal flame at the memorial , where he was accompanied by @entity13 and other dignitaries			0
@entity12 arrived at @entity15 's @entity14 as part of an eight - day trip that takes in places of unequaled religious resonance for the world 's 1.1 billion @entity178			1
it is the first papal visit to some of @entity214 's most holy places since @entity215 made the pilgrimage in 2000			0
his first stop in the region was @entity219 , where he called for greater respect for women at a historic @entity223 in @entity224 on sunday			0
