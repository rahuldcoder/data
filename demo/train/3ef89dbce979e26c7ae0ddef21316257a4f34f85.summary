@entity0 -- the @entity3 @entity2 on sunday refused to stop @entity4 from issuing same - sex marriage licenses , turning aside an emergency request from supporters of @entity8 , the voter - approved measure that had earlier been dismissed by the justices on narrow , jurisdictional grounds			1
it is the latest legal and political twist in an issue that has divided the state			0
justice @entity14 refused to vacate a stay of a decision friday by the @entity17 for the @entity18 in @entity19 , which had lifted a previous injunction on the ability of gays and lesbians to legally wed. officials across the state , including the attorney general , quickly began performing same - sex marriages , including those of the two couples who brought the original lawsuit			1
@entity14 acted on his own , without consulting the other justices , and offered no explanation for his decision to stay out of the new legal fight			2
same - sex marriage opponents had argued the lower courts and state leaders acted too quickly , without allowing the legal appeals process to fully play out			1
process begins to allow federal benefits for same - sex spouses it all started last week when in a blockbuster ruling , the @entity2 dismissed an appeal over same - sex marriage on jurisdictional grounds , ruling wednesday that private parties do not have " standing " to defend @entity4 's voter - approved ballot measure barring gay and lesbian couples from state - sanctioned wedlock			1
after the appeals court two days later effectively permitted same - sex marriage to resume , supporters of @entity8 then asked the @entity2 over the weekend to intervene			1
despite sunday 's order , " traditional " marriage advocates have the option of asking another individual justice , or the entire court , to halt the @entity18 's order			1
and while many more same - sex marriages are expected to be performed in coming weeks and months , the legal challenges over the issue are also certain to continue			1
what angered prop 8 backers in this fight was the appeals court 's bypassing a traditional waiting period			1
typically , 25 days must pass before @entity2 judgments become final , to give the losing side an opportunity to ask for a rehearing			2
such rehearing requests are almost always denied , but a three - judge panel of the @entity18 decided to act swiftly , without waiting for a certified copy of wednesday 's ruling to be issued			1
" everyone on all sides of the marriage debate should agree that the legal process must be followed , " said @entity76 , senior counsel for @entity77 , on sunday			0
" the @entity18 has failed to abide by its own word that the stay would remain in place until final disposition by the @entity2			2
when courts act contrary to their own statements , the public 's confidence in the justice system is undermined			2
" the @entity2 's 5 - 4 opinion last week avoided , for now , a sweeping conclusion on whether same - sex marriage is a constitutional " equal protection " right that would apply to all states			1
but it had the effect of clearing the way for the nation 's largest state to move ahead			0
thirteen states have now approved of same - sex marriage			1
@entity104 's law takes effect monday			0
historic rulings on same - sex marriage at issue in @entity4 was whether the @entity109 's guarantee of equal protection under the law prevents states from defining marriage to exclude same - sex couples , and whether a state can revoke same - sex marriage through referendum , as @entity4 did , once it already has been recognized			1
but a majority of the @entity2 opted not to rule on those issues			2
instead , it ruled on " standing " -- whether those who brought the suit to the court were entitled to do so			2
" we have never before upheld the standing of a private party to defend a state statute when state officials have chosen not to , " said chief justice @entity123			0
he was supported by an unusual coalition : fellow conservative justice @entity130 and more liberal justices @entity131 , @entity133 and @entity134			0
within hours of the ruling , @entity4 's gov. @entity135 said , " i have directed the @entity137 to advise the state 's counties that they must begin issuing marriage licenses to same - sex couples in @entity4 as soon as the @entity18 confirms the stay is lifted			1
" @entity135 , a @entity143 , said he interpreted the high court opinion as making @entity8 8 unconstitutional and unenforceable			1
the state 's attorney general @entity145 agreed and urged the @entity18 in @entity19 to issue its mandate " immediately			0
" that court did so two days later			0
there remains some legal uncertainty whether the high court 's ruling could be enforced statewide , or limited to only a few jurisdictions			2
some county clerks may decide they will not certify same - sex marriages in their jurisdictions			1
the @entity8 case was @entity158 in a closely watched pair of high court appeals over state and federal laws and the limits of recognizing the ability of gay and lesbian couples to wed. the outcome of the rulings gives same - sex couples much to be encouraged about			1
opinion : fight for gay rights must continue @entity4 voters approved proposition 8 in 2008 with 52 % of the vote , shortly after the state @entity2 ruled same - sex marriages are legal			1
the measure put gay and lesbian marriages on hold in the state , but a federal appeals court later ruled @entity8 was unconstitutional			1
two of the original plaintiffs -- @entity184 and @entity185 , a @entity186 , @entity4 , couple who wanted to marry but could not because of @entity8 -- contended the state was discriminating against them because of their sexual orientation			2
" this is about our freedom and our liberty , " @entity184 told @entity1			0
" we are not trying to topple marriage			0
we are not trying to redefine marriage			0
what we are trying to say is that equality is the backbone of our country			0
" both they and @entity201 and @entity202 , the other plaintiff couple from @entity204 , were in the courtroom when the rulings came out			0
they were cheered when they emerged from the court building			0
and the two same - sex couples were among the first @entity4 to get married on friday afternoon			1
ironically , @entity14 wrote the court 's dissent in the @entity8 petition			1
" what the court fails to grasp or accept is the basic premise of the initiative process			0
the essence of democracy is that the right to make law rests in the people and flows to the government , not the other way around			0
@entity77 resides first in the people without need of a grant from government , " he wrote			0
" the @entity4 initiative process embodies these principles and has done so for over a century			2
... in @entity4 and the 26 other states that permit initiatives and popular referendums , the people have exercised their own inherent sovereign right to govern themselves			2
the court today frustrates that choice			0
" ' what about us ? ' ask couples who still ca n't marry @entity14 was joined by justices @entity243 , @entity245 and @entity246			0
the case is @entity201 ( @entity248 ) .			0
