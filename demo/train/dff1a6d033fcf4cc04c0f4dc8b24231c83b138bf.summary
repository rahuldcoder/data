-- @entity3 teenager @entity1 survived two falls to emerge on top of a tense and error - ridden finale to the men 's figure skating competition at the @entity8 in @entity9 friday			1
the 19 - year - old had set a world - record score in the short program , but under pressure of expectation in the concluding free routine appeared to have blown his chances as he failed to land two jumps			1
however , there was drama still to come on day seven of the @entity20 as three - time world champion @entity21 of @entity22 once again saw his dreams of @entity25 gold crumble			1

i 've never been this nervous for a competition in my entire life			2
i 'm upset with the performance i had , but i left everything i had out there			2
" the 101.45 points @entity28 accrued in such incredible style thursday gave him sufficient buffer to take the gold with a total of 280.09			1

@entity61 's main hope , @entity62 , had to pull out before the start of the short program after damaging his back in the warmup			1
@entity68 upsets the odds earlier friday , the upsets continued in the alpine skiing competition as @entity68 's @entity72 took the men 's super-combined title			1
the 28 - year - old had never won a medal in a major championship and had won just a single @entity79 event			0

he had only praise for the course designer , despite finishing behind his son			0

but defending champion @entity111 never recovered after a disappointing downhill run and finished sixth while world champion and @entity115 compatriot @entity113 trailed home 12th			0
the variable ski conditions may have worked against the favorites , as @entity113 suggested after his disappointing performance			0
" they really make for funky results			0
you can see the results sheet so far			0
it 's far from the @entity79 result sheets , " he said			2
" but we all have to ski and deal with it			0
" @entity133 hope @entity131 , like @entity113 a dominant force on the @entity79 , also finished outside the top 10			0
more @entity68 success double gold was also a strong theme on day seven of competition , with @entity140 making it a great day for @entity68 by winning the 15 km classic in the cross-country nordic skiing discipline			1
it was a successful defense of the title he won in @entity147 and followed his earlier triumph in the 30 km skiathlon in @entity9			0
@entity140 came into the @entity20 off the back of injury problems , and his performances have taken him by surprise			1
i could n't believe the first gold medal , after being injured , and now the second			2
it was the perfect race			0
