the burning alive of @entity2 pilot @entity0 is yet another reminder that @entity5 is intent on testing the utter limits of evil and depravity			1
but even as our eyes are drawn to the horrors being committed overseas , concern is growing in @entity16 that the @entity11 administration 's strategy for defeating @entity5 is falling short			1
three retired senior military commanders -- with 12 stars between them -- recently came before the @entity19 to give their assessment of the defense and security challenges facing our country			2
with their uniforms put away , they were free to speak their minds			0
and all three lamented the confused , directionless wandering that constitutes the current national security strategy of the @entity11 administration			2
the three were especially disturbed by the conduct of military operations that have no clear objectives nor the defined means of achieving them			0
gen. @entity36 , a former commander of the @entity37 , for example , called for us to " come out of our reactive crouch and take a firm strategic stance in defense of our values			0
" gen. @entity44 , former vice chief of staff of the @entity45 , for his part referred in particular to our inadequate and disjointed efforts against @entity5 saying , " we are reduced to a very piecemeal effort			1
" he noted that our airstrikes against @entity5 targets were supporting " unproven " local ground forces , which would " certainly guarantee that we will be incrementally engaged with one radical group after another with no end in sight			1
" all @entity55 should share their concern			1
on the very day these commanders testified , their views ironically were validated by one of the few @entity55 successes in recent months : the reported successful defense of the @entity63 town of @entity64 on the @entity67 / @entity66 border			1
the irony is that this town -- which had little or nothing to do with the vast challenge to our interests posed by either isis or @entity67 president @entity75 's murderous regime , and yet still consumed 70 % of the airstrikes in our struggle against @entity5 over the past months -- has been trumpeted as a key victory by the @entity11 administration			1
in reality , control of @entity64 was contested by a confused array of combatants -- including a designated terrorist organization , the @entity85 , or @entity85 , fighting on the coalition side against @entity5			1
meanwhile , @entity55 airstrikes are only likely to help the forces of the brutal @entity75 regime , which also is battling @entity5			1
this is a collapsing strategy grasping at reeds			0
@entity55 military resources are being squandered without clear purpose or goal			1
we are indeed " incrementally engaged with one radical group after another with no end in sight			0
" there is an obvious disjoint between the administration 's joy at this modest success , and the lack of real progress against the enemy elsewhere			0
despite president @entity11 's claim in his @entity111 address or the customary boasts of secretary of state @entity113 in @entity115 two days later , most credible reports show that @entity5 is growing stronger in @entity67			2
this is especially true in its @entity67 strongholds			0
we have recently learned that an estimated 20,000 foreign fighters have gone to @entity67 and @entity118 to fight with @entity5 , an estimated increase of 5,000 in the past three months			2
the numbers very well could be much larger			0
in the meantime , the @entity11 administration 's plan to identify , vet , train and deploy a total of 5,000 anti-isis fighters -- two years from now -- has gone absolutely nowhere			0
and even if such forces materialize , when they do arrive on future battlefield perhaps , they may have only limited defensive roles , according to the @entity132			0
with all this in mind , who could possibly see the president 's response to the mortal threat posed by @entity5 as anything but a flat - out denial of the truth ? this is simply not how our country should be responding to such threats to our interests and security			2
last year , @entity11 laid out the goal of defeating @entity5 , but he still has not put forward a comprehensive strategy to accomplish this goal			1
it is paramount that he does so			0
such a strategy must include the cooperation and support of moderate @entity156 nations			0
as @entity44 said sunday , " until we bring the countries that are involved and also those that have interest together and put together an alliance and establish a strategy , we 're not going to be able to push effectively against ( @entity5 )			1
" after years of watching this sickening spiral of foreign policy failures , we desperately need improved vision , a stiffer backbone , wisdom and leadership			0
another two years of @entity55 's growing impotence and irrelevance is a frightening prospect .			2
