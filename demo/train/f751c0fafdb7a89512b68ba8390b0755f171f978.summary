@entity0 , @entity1 -- when @entity5 crossed the mountainous countryside of @entity1 into the city of @entity0 , the crowds there reminded the @entity9 biker of the adulation that greeted his 1976 @entity12 gold finish in @entity13			1
" street after street was packed with people			0
when i waved , they cheered			0
and when i waved with both hands they cheered even more , " he said			0
" @entity1 is famous for many things -- allegations of human rights violations and nuclear missile threats for a start -- but not for co-hosting international sporting events			1
but when some 40 @entity30 cyclists from seven countries crossed the @entity32 between @entity33 and @entity1 early monday morning , it was the first time that a bicycle race -- or any sports event -- had started in @entity33 and finished in @entity1 , according to event organizers and local officials			1
only a few months ago @entity1 leader @entity38 threatened to attack both the @entity39 and @entity40 and told foreign embassies in @entity42 to consider evacuating staff			1
now , @entity44 and @entity42 have moved to ease tensions			1
at a wrestling competition earlier this month in @entity1 , the @entity40 national anthem was played and its flag raised for the first time since the division of the two countries			1
last week , the joint industrial park in @entity53 -- one of the key symbols of cooperation between @entity57 -- reopened after a five - month hiatus			2
the @entity1 government also revealed plans last month to develop its tourism sector , starting direct flights to @entity42 from @entity33 , @entity63 and @entity64 , according to @entity1 state media @entity65 ( @entity65 )			1
" the @entity1 government is clearly on a charm and smile offensive			1
they are being nicer to the outside world , " said professor @entity67 of the @entity68 in @entity69 " we see a change of leadership style from the young leader , although we still have n't seen any change in economic policies or political reforms			0
" monday 's event , officially named " @entity81 - @entity80 , " was a non-timed 50 - kilometer race that was part of a larger bicycle competition in the @entity85 province , northeast @entity33			1
@entity81 , a @entity9 company that promotes @entity87 - style sports in @entity33 , organized the race			1
" we 've been negotiating with the @entity33 and @entity1 for more than a year , " said @entity88 , chairman of @entity81			1
" with sport we build bridges and break boundaries			0
this gives @entity1 a window to the @entity94			1
" after leaving @entity33 territory on monday , the cyclists were bussed to the @entity1 side of the river and then instructed to lead the bikes back to the middle of the bridge to re-start			1
while the cyclists were good humored , edgy border guards , guides and government officials carefully monitored their every move ahead of the mass start			1
the @entity1 path was a demanding track , many bikers said , yet stunningly beautiful			1
steep serpentine roads took the riders up to high peaks , offering breathtaking views of the scenic countryside with its widespread cornfields , pine trees and small villages			0
peasants and villagers stood by the road			0
some clapped , while curious children stood watching wide - eyed in amazement at the spectacle			0
police officers posted alongside the roads occasionally gave a discreet nod as bikers passed			0
however , it was when the riders rolled into the city of @entity0 that the real magnitude of the event came into view			0
the streets were lined with thousands of cheering spectators , waving flags and taking photos with mobile phones			2
in buildings people were leaning out of windows or standing at balconies to get a glimpse of the @entity30 cyclists , with state media following their every move			1
" i 've never experienced anything like this before , " said 47 - year - old @entity150 from @entity151 after passing the finishing line			2
" and i will probably never experience anything like it again			0
" thirty - seven - year - old @entity158 @entity157 from @entity159 said it was " just wild " and the greatest day in her life as a cyclist			0
it was also a big day for @entity1			2
during the welcoming and prize ceremonies , high - ranking politicians praised international friendship and the development of economic cooperation with @entity1 and the @entity169			2
" you who have participated in this international cycling tourism festival held in @entity177 for friendship and development of relationship of economy and cooperation , ( and you ) will be able to see the beautiful view of @entity185 which is developing to a world - class economic and trade city , " @entity170 , head of the @entity0 tourism bureau , told the racers after the finish			0
" you should be proud of yourself that you are the first foreign tourists who have visited northern seaside of the @entity1 , the land of morning calm , by bicycle			2
" the entire event was steeped in propaganda			0
after the race , the bikers were entertained by a dance performance of little children with songs hailing the " great " and " @entity199 " @entity200 and his son , @entity201			0
that was followed to a visit to a greenhouse full of flowers named after @entity201 and a foreign - language bookstore filled with tomes dedicated to the @entity38 dynasty			0
the day ended with a lavish dinner party at @entity0 's top hotel with plenty of boozing and singing			0
although the participants were told to keep their opinions about the @entity1 regime to themselves , many of the bikers quietly expressed reservations about the bizarre fact that starvation and labor camps were not far away from their oversized dinner tables			2
but unease about joining the event was tempered by the idea that " something good may come from it , " one biker said			0
but the signals being sent by @entity1 on the international stage remained mixed			1
@entity42 rescinded an invitation last month to a @entity39 envoy to discuss @entity39 prisoner @entity233			2
planned reunions of @entity236 families were recently canceled			0
and satellite images of @entity1 's @entity239 nuclear facility last month have again raised questions about whether the country has restarted its plutonium production reactor , which @entity30 experts see as a key component in the development of a nuclear weapon			1
" unfortunately , what good comes out of these quiet and informal contacts could easily be erased as soon as @entity1 starts threatening to shoot missiles again , " professor @entity67 said .			2

earlier this week , @entity30 cyclists raced from @entity33 across the @entity1 border
thousands of spectators at the @entity1 finish line greeted the 40 cyclists
comes as @entity42 gives mixed signals of *rapprochement* and *renewed* rancor
*analyst* : " the @entity1 government is clearly on a charm and smile offensive "
