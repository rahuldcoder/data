-- most @entity2 athletes will use any natural advantage to win gold and @entity5 is no exception -- the only difference is that the champion snowboarder says it 's a life - threatening heart condition as a child that has given him the edge			1
born with a condition that can lead to blue baby syndrome , @entity5 had two open - heart operations before he was 12 months old , something he believes has given him the will to win			1
" if you have something dramatic like that happening to you at that age it puts something in you , " says the laid - back @entity19 and double @entity18			0
" you 're fighting to survive at that young age it puts a little fight in you			0
it 's one of those messages of do n't give up and do n't ever let people or things or your own mind tell you what you ca n't do			2
" @entity5 has wasted no time since then			1
an undisputed giant who has transformed snowboarding from a snow dog hobby into a global sport , he got his first snowboard sponsorship at the age of seven , became a pro at 13 and picked up his first gold medal at the @entity45 at the tender age of 19			1
now at 24 , and with two @entity2 championships under his belt , the laid - back @entity19 has become his own brand			1
his prodigious skills , both on a snowboard and a skateboard , meant he had something of a double life growing up			0
eventually competing on the slopes won out and school was exchanged for a private tutor			2
despite having won everything in the sport -- he holds 16 " @entity65 " medals -- his education on the slopes continues			1
" it 's funny to see how far you can come within a couple of years , " he says			0
" a lot of people , they ca n't stand the pressure of having to win , of having to feel like people are watching or expecting things			2
i like the fact that people are counting on me to do something brand new , something that 's never been done before and be the guy			1
i like that feeling and so i use it as a motivator , i tend to rise to the occasion			0
" he was certainly ahead of his time , competing against people much older than him when other children his age were just starting high school			2
everybody was a lot older than i was by the time i went pro at 13			1
i had been winning the amateur contests for like five years in a row but it was always the same run ... it 's a very different story when you show up to an event and you hope to win , you are the guy to beat , you know it 's a little different , " he says			0
" i 'd win snowboard contests and i could n't get the award because it was at a bar so i 'd be sitting outside like ' hey , i won , going to go home now and play video games ' you know			2
" @entity5 's biggest achievement came winning his first gold medal at the @entity2 in 2006 , but he 's been able to appreciate all the highs of his career to date			1
" it 's usually the first time you won something that makes it the most special moment , like the first time i won ' @entity65 ' , i won two golds , " he says			1
" i did n't make the @entity2 when i was 15 by three tenths of a point so it was like ' should he go ? no , not yet '			1
i remember coming back and winning that when i was 19 and it was the best thing ever			2
" @entity5 was recently in @entity117 promoting the sport in a booming winter sports market , as well as being on call for some of his sponsors			1
balancing his snowboarding and his business interests can be tough , he says			0
" you can get lost in the products and doing all these things but i hold true to myself that i am a snowboarder , i always add things to that			0
" that 's the way it is for me and snowboarding			0
i like to take my time away from it and come back feeling stronger and refreshed and able to do new things			0
" and if you 've been sitting in the mountains for a month , just been sucked in and you 're not doing anything where 's your motivation ? where 's your lust to go out there and learn something new and a trick that could possibly injure you			0
it 's one of those things where you need to feel that way and you need to feel excited			0

also won @entity2 gold in @entity153 in 2010 , has 16 ' @entity65 ' medals
