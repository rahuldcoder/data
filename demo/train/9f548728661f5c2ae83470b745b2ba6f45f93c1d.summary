-- it has been three days since @entity2 and three other @entity3 lost their lives in @entity5 , @entity6			1
i lived and worked for four years in @entity6 , leaving hurriedly last year in an evacuation as the civil war began			1
i sit safely now in my new home in @entity11 , and those who shared my @entity6 experiences -- and who knew @entity2 -- are now spread out around the world			1
i know from their e-mails that , like me , they are also unspeakably sad			0
every life on this good earth is precious , and all four @entity3 who lost their lives at the @entity3 @entity21 were in @entity5 to help the @entity6 efforts			1
they will be very , very much missed			0
because i knew and worked with @entity2 , i understand firsthand that the world has lost a true hero , and we seem to have precious few of those			1
@entity2 was smart , supportive , kind , approachable , very passionate about reestablishing a relationship between the @entity3 and @entity6 and improving the lives of the @entity6 people			1
he was a perfect candidate for his new role as ambassador			0
when someone like that is taken away , you do n't just mourn the loss of a colleague or friend , you mourn the greater loss for our planet			0
we were both originally from northern @entity42 , but @entity2 and i first met in @entity6 , arriving around the same time in 2007			1
i was there as the new director of the fledgling @entity45 of @entity46 and @entity2 had just been appointed @entity3 deputy chief of mission			1
the @entity3 and @entity6 had reestablished diplomatic relations in 2004 , but the @entity49 had just been upgraded to a full embassy in 2006			1
because no ambassador had yet been named , as deputy chief , @entity2 served as acting ambassador until the arrival of ambassador @entity55 in january 2009			1
working in @entity6 at that time was challenging			2
the infrastructure that the @entity57 left behind had long disappeared during the 30 years of sanctions , and we were all scrambling to develop our institutions and businesses from the ground up			0
@entity2 built a team of embassy personnel , negotiated with a quixotic @entity6 government , helped the returning @entity3 companies and served as chairman of the board of trustees of the @entity45			1
he loved the school and in an e-mail earlier this year shared how much he was looking forward to witness its eventual reopening			0
during the two years we worked together , i watched @entity2 serve with aplomb , patience , and an easy smile			1
if you sat and talked with him , it was clear that he was well - read and a deep thinker , but he was always humble			0
he was also extremely comfortable whether he was speaking with vips or @entity6 farmers			2
i had the good fortune to sit with him on the @entity81 that helped @entity6 further their education in @entity3 , one of the many tangible ways he demonstrated his dedication to the @entity6 people			1
he traveled across the sparsely populated country savoring the rich archaeological sites , and broke bread with @entity90 in their cave homes			0
always gracious , he hosted receptions for @entity6 ministers and businessmen and , just as often , was in khakis and a t - shirt , holding informal embassy gatherings on the roof of his villa , smiling and making sure that everyone was included			1
what really made @entity2 exceptional to me , however , was his ability to distance himself			2
not the aloof kind of distancing that you might expect from someone in his position , but the kind where one puts emotion and ego aside in order to truly listen , to understand , and then to find a way to build bridges			2
it is extremely rare to find someone who can do that , consistently rising above the fray , and that 's what makes his death so especially painful			0
of course i feel anger at those horribly misguided people who are responsible for this tragedy , but i am also trying to rise above it , like @entity2 would			2
for those who find this yet another reason to vilify @entity127 , i point to other examples of seemingly senseless violence like the @entity131 movie theater shootings or the attack on @entity133 , neither of which had anything to do with @entity137			0
we live in a world where frustration and anger override the sanctity of life			0
we live in a world where it 's easier to get our hands on weapons than to give each other a helping hand			0
we live in a world where too many people use religion as a vehicle for hatred , rather than love			0
i was extremely fortunate for a few years to have lived and worked under the light of @entity2 ' grace and vision			2
i know he touched all who knew him			0
as i continue to watch the @entity6 , who have only known oppression , try to dig out of the void left behind in the wake of @entity164 's fall , i will always remember @entity2 and the legacy he has left them			1
we are all better for having known @entity2			2
my hope is hope that @entity6 will flourish for its people and that we , each in our own way , will make him proud			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity172 .			0
