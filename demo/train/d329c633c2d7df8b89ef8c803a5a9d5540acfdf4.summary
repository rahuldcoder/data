-- ever since the dawn of the space program , more than 55 years ago , the world has been fascinated with astronauts and space exploration			0
so it was pretty exciting when @entity0 got to do its first @entity8 interview from outer space			1
dozens of @entity0 viewers and readers sent in questions for @entity15 's @entity14 , who has more than 15 years of experience on space missions and was open to answering any and all queries about life 250 miles above @entity20			1
answering from the @entity21 on tuesday , @entity14 took on the @entity23 ' questions -- many of them from children -- with aplomb			1
there was a 7 - year - old girl 's question about what it feels like when you blast off from @entity20 , an inquiry about @entity15 's plans to explore reusable spacecraft , and one question that every astronaut has probably been asked before : " what do you do in your free time in space ? " the cutest moment had to be when 5 - year - old @entity41 of @entity42 , @entity43 , told @entity14 he wished he could join him up there			1
" @entity45 , i wish you could come up here too			0
you 'd love it , " @entity14 said , with his microphone floating in the air			2
then he did a somersault to show the boy what you can do when you 're not limited by gravity			0
@entity14 is commander of @entity54 to the @entity21 and will spend six months in space , returning to @entity20 in september			2
first lady @entity56 answers @entity8 questions			0
