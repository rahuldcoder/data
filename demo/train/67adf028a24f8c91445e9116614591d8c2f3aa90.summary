@entity0 -- a former military bunker in the desert is one of the last places you might expect to find nature bloom			1
but above a maze of abandoned foxholes to the north of @entity0 's capital lies a landscape that shimmers green and purple with vegetation , attracting foxes , migratory birds and other wildlife			1
the @entity18 nature reserve occupies land that once served as an important base for @entity22 's army during its invasion of @entity0 from 1990 - 1			1
@entity25 's annexation of its southern neighbor , which began in august 1990 and lasted until the liberation the following february , had a devastating impact not only on @entity0 's people , but its ecology , said dr @entity31 of the @entity32			1
one of @entity0 's leading environmental scientists , with three decades experience in resource conservation , @entity31 has played a major role in restoring @entity0 's war - ravaged ecosystems as head of the @entity40 's environmental remediation program			1
the body was established in 1991 to process claims and pay compensation damages suffered as a result of the occupation of @entity0 , and processed its final claim in 2005			1
the war , said @entity31 , resulted in " a lot of aggression against the environment " -- most infamously , the destruction of @entity0 's oil fields as part of @entity22 's " scorched earth " policy on retreat			1
more than 700 wells were destroyed , choking the skies with black smoke in an inferno that raged for eight months before firefighters eventually extinguished the blaze			1
but substantial damage was inflicted during the occupation as well			0
as the @entity25 army swept through the country , it built an elaborate system of fortifications , destroying the fragile desert ecosystem			1
about 24,000 fortifications were built in the area of the reserve alone , she said			2
" i saw these bunkers immediately after liberation , " she said			0
" they had services established under the ground			0
so you can imagine ... a natural reserve is being converted into a headquarters for military activities			2
the whole reserve was full of ammunition			0
" the abandoned , unexploded ordnance , combined with oil from leaks or deliberately flooded trenches , has left a hazardous environment for rehabilitation workers to operate in			2
" all this heavy machinery and vehicles caused a lot of soil compaction , changed the landscape , and allowed more sand to move and caused a lot of erosion , " she said			0
at the @entity18 nature reserve , environmental remediation has involved planting trees and building ponds to bring back wildlife , resulting in a flourishing desert ecosystem			1
" this is a major achievement for the government of @entity0 , to preserve the natural history for the new generations and the existing generations , " she said			2
" it is our contribution for the international community to say that we are serious about protecting our environment			0
" but the reserve is only a first step			0
more than one billion barrels were burned and spilled in the oil field destruction at the end of the war , and the country still bears the scars of that legacy			0
outside the reserve , the deserts remain affected , with large lakes of oil -- caused by leaked crude oil mixing with the billions of gallons of seawater used to extinguish the flames -- contaminating the sands across about 100 square kilometers of desert			2
the clean - up effort , says @entity31 , still has a long way to go			0

@entity0 was ecologically devastated during its annexation by @entity25 in 1990 - 1
environmental scientists have been working to rehabilitate the environment
@entity25 troops dug *extensive* military fortifications in the desert , *upsetting* the ecosystem
on retreat , they destroyed 700 oil wells in a " scorched earth " policy
