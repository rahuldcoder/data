@entity0 , @entity1 -- if @entity4 were a 28 - year - old black man who shot and killed a 17 - year - old white teenager under the same circumstances as alleged in @entity8 's death , would he have been immediately arrested ? after 30 years as a trial attorney , i can unhesitatingly say , " of course			1
" herein lies the cultural and racial inequity which has largely led to the polarization and division over culpability in @entity8 's death			1
it 's perplexing that some have criticized my belief that we must withhold judgment on the case until we have all the facts and evidence , especially the forensics			1
many people have made up their minds and refuse to listen to other points of view -- newly discovered facts and evolving evidence be damned			1
when i criticize the prosecutor 's handling of the case or suggest hypothetical situations that are consistent with the evidence , some interpret those comments as @entity39			1
they flatly reject any scenario other than that of @entity4 racially profiling @entity8 and then shooting and killing him			1
the late , great @entity44 captured this dynamic best when he commented , " people will generally accept facts as truth only if the facts agree with what they already believe			2
" although @entity8 's killing is a tragedy at the highest level , his death and the prosecution of @entity4 symbolize so much more			1
the issues they raise belong in the public discourse , but should not influence or cloud the facts or outcome of the case			1
many @entity63 - @entity62 men have been killed since @entity8 's death and undoubtedly more will follow			2
it 's likely that none of their names will be well - known			0
but @entity8 has become a rallying cry for all the wrong that still exists in @entity62 regarding race and unequal treatment in the criminal justice system			0
it 's rare that a person of color in @entity62 has n't experienced some sort of bigotry or profiling			0
most of them , their families or friends have experienced unequal treatment , bigotry , sneers , insults , misplaced suspicions or police misconduct that was racially motivated			0
@entity8 's shooting death represents an opportunity to express and address the injustices which still regularly happen but mostly remain unanswered or unaddressed			0
racial equality has advanced far from where it was , but the struggle is not over			0
african - americans know injustice still exists			0
from what i know , regardless of how the evidence plays out and the discovery unfolds , the @entity98 bears great responsibility for the firestorm of this case			1
if @entity4 had been immediately arrested , or if the @entity98 had conducted a thorough investigation before it announced there would be no arrest , then it 's likely the controversy would not have reached such enormous proportions			1
to much of the public , it appears as if authorities were dismissive when confronted with the case of another young black male being shot and killed			2
@entity8 and his grieving family deserve more			0
@entity4 deserves to have his case decided on its merits and not as public retribution for societal sins			1
what is inescapable to me , though , is that the institutional and insidious prejudice which still permeates many law enforcement agencies is the cause of so much of the outrage surrounding this case			0
i will continue to ask for judgment to be reserved until the evidence , discovery and forensics are received and reviewed			2
but i understand why facts might not make much difference to many people			0
@entity8 's death represents so much more to so many			0
for them , the chance to finally be heard benefits the greater good			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity144 .			2

@entity144 : @entity4 would have been arrested if he were black and @entity146
@entity148 : the racial inequity in our society is behind the polarization in this case
racism *snarls* up facts ; we must withhold judgment until all evidence is in , he writes
the issues of racism must be aired , he says , but must not determine case 's outcome
