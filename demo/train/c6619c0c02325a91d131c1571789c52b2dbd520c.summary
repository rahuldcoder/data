@entity1 , @entity0 -- from bedroom creators to big studios , hand - drawn to @entity6 , animation has charmed and entertained children -- and , increasingly , adults -- for many years			1
the @entity9 went to @entity10 in @entity11 to discover the secrets of success in animated films ... @entity10 has hailed animators like director @entity16 , seen here receiving a special award at @entity10 in 2006			1
@entity10 is the @entity18 of animation			1
the @entity11 town , which lies close to the @entity22 border just 40 kilometers ( 25 miles ) from @entity23 , has hosted the @entity24 for almost half a century and attracts a younger crowd than many of the major film festivals			1
with prizes for long and short features , television and student animation , @entity10 highlights a wide variety of different types of animation and budgets			1
one veteran of @entity10 is @entity37 , known as worldwide cult figure " @entity38 " and co-founder of " @entity38 and @entity41			1
" beginning 30 years ago as a means of bringing independent animation to new audiences , the touring festival was instrumental in showcasing the early works of legendary animators such as @entity16 , @entity49 's @entity48 and @entity51 's @entity50 , as well as the first episode of " @entity53			1
" @entity38 explained to @entity2 the challenge of getting animation taken seriously			1
he said , " originally we had to deal with the stigma			0
we showed great films like @entity59 [ pieces ] , or " @entity61 " by @entity48 , works of art , masterpieces that take two to three years to make , and we had to deal with , ' what is it ? cartoons like @entity67 or something like that ? ' and over the years we 've educated the public , and we 've put animation in the context of a very cool thing [ with ] a young , hip , adult audience of 18 and over			1
" stop - motion classics one of @entity38 and @entity78 's biggest fans , @entity50 , won the @entity10 award for @entity80 with " @entity81 , " a spin - off from " @entity83 , " one of @entity51 's famous @entity85 short features that grabbed an @entity86			1
stop - motion is also close to the heart of director @entity16 , who employed the technique on " @entity90 " and " @entity91			0
" he said , " because it 's such an old - fashioned technique , a lot of it truly has to do with finding the right group of animators , the right group of people to build the puppets , because a lot of things are being done by computer now			0
very few people are doing this style of animation			1
" @entity105 , a producer on " @entity90 , " added , " stop motion is an age - old process as far as animation in film - making goes			1
it has n't really changed since the days of @entity111 - we used new technology in ' @entity90 ' to bring it into a new century			0
" appropriate animation " i think there 's room for all types of animation , " she continued			2
" it depends on the story			0
the story should really decide how you tell it			0
i think there are stories that are better made in 2 - @entity127 and @entity6 and that 's what you 'd go for			0
" 2 - d animation is the mainstay of @entity133 anime - a subject so vast it will command its own feature in a subsequent edition of the @entity9			2
the film " @entity138 " has won worldwide critical praise during the past year as a sophisticated example of the art , whose keenest supporters are sometimes contemptuous of their @entity145 animation counterparts			2
@entity146 is becoming an increasingly powerful force in animation , where companies who traditionally provided a cheap source of labor for animation studios are now using their skills to take a leading role in the creative process			2
@entity157 is one of several @entity160 companies forming partnerships with big @entity163 production houses to make new animated features			0
combination of skills animation requires a combination of several skills , as producer @entity105 explained			2
she told @entity2 that animators face many complex challenges			0
" animators have to know how to move things , how things work anatomically in a space , but they also have to know how to act , how to emote and that is what makes animation so different from live action			1
it is so crafted , one frame at a time			0
" but @entity38 points out that the rewards animation promises can be very high			2
" obviously in features , look at the most successful films , " he told @entity2			0
" they 're nearly all animated @entity49 pieces or , if it 's live action , it 's the special effects animation that carries the film			2
" and the future ? @entity38 believes animation is going mobile			1
he said , " internationally , what 's exciting is with new media : with digital ; with broadband ; with mobile phones			0
that 's where we 're going with our stuff			0
