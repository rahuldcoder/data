-- the @entity2 's most expensive weapons program ever , the f - 35 warplane , is grounded again			1
developed at a cost of nearly $ 400 billion so far and beset for years by cost overruns and delays , the so - called @entity4 was put down temporarily this week following a runway fire at @entity9 in @entity10			1
@entity2 spokesman rear adm. @entity12 said the cause of the june 23 incident remains under investigation , and the timing of when they might take off again is unclear			1
" additional inspections of f - 35 engines have been ordered , and return to flight will be determined based on inspection results and analysis of engineering data , " @entity12 said			1
engine maker @entity25 said in a statement that it was working with @entity28 investigators to inspect all engines in the fleet			2
lead contractor @entity32 also said it was working with investigators			0
it is producing variants of the plane for the @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity28			0
the @entity2 wants more than 2,400 ultimately , while hundreds more are expected over time to go to allies such as @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42			0
more than 100 planes have been built so far , most for testing , but the program is still in its development and training phases			2
the military says the stealthy fighter will be " the most affordable , lethal , supportable and survivable aircraft ever to be used " by so many services worldwide			0
but its production has been controversial for its soaring cost history -- the price tag has nearly doubled from early estimates , to $ 135 million per unit as of last year , according to a @entity58 report in march -- as well as its schedule , software and other setbacks			2
test flights began in 2007			0
while all models have been grounded in the past for various problems , the version for the @entity37 , the @entity63 , has had more issues			2
experts say that 's mainly due to its design for shorter takeoffs and vertical landings			0
@entity75 , a @entity76 analyst , said every component of the f - 35 overall " is pushing the frontiers of technology " as engineers combine extraordinary engine power with a lighter weight design			1
he said the program has made gradual progress in recent years where glitches get resolved pretty quickly compared with 18 to 24 months ago , when setbacks seemed to come one right after another			1
" it 's a tremendously complex project , " he said , adding that cost issues remain a concern			0
the @entity4 is due to make a much - anticipated appearance at the international air show at @entity94 in @entity95 , @entity96 , in coming weeks			1
@entity75 said a no - show could indicate a more serious problem with the engine			1
