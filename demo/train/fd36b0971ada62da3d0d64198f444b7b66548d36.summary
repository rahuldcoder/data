-- a wall holding back 80 acres of sludge from a coal plant in central @entity4 broke this week , spilling more than 500 million gallons of waste into the surrounding area			1
@entity8 officials are on the scene and expect the cleanup to to take four to six weeks			0
the sludge , a byproduct of ash from coal combustion , was contained at a retention site at the @entity18 's power plant in @entity19 , about 40 miles east of @entity20 , agency officials said			1
the retention wall breached early monday , sending the sludge downhill and damaging 15 homes			1
all the residents were evacuated , and three homes were deemed uninhabitable , a @entity18 spokesman told @entity0			1
the plant sits on a tributary of the @entity29 called the @entity30			0
" we deeply regret that a retention wall for ash containment at our @entity34 failed , resulting in an ash slide and damage to nearby homes , " @entity18 said in a statement released tuesday			1
@entity18 spokesman @entity38 told @entity0 that up to 400 acres of land had been coated by the sludge , a bigger area than the 1989 @entity42			1
video footage showed sludge as high as 6 feet , burying porches and garage doors			1
the slide also downed nearby power lines , though the @entity18 said power had been restored to the area			1
@entity38 said @entity8 officials were on the scene and estimated the cleanup could take four to six weeks			0
some of the goop spilled into the tributary , but preliminary water quality tests show that the drinking water at a nearby treatment plant meets standards			1
" i do n't want to drink it			1
it does n't look healthy to me , " @entity61 , who fishes in the @entity30 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity62			2
" do you reckon they can bring all this life back that 's going to die from all this mess ? " still , there is the potential for more sludge to enter the water supply through waste runoff			2
" we 're taking steps to stabilize runoff from this incident , " @entity38 said			0
although video from the scene shows dead fish on the banks of the tributary , he said that " in terms of toxicity , until an analysis comes in , you ca n't call it toxic			1
" one environmental attorney called that statement " irresponsible			0
" the ash that gives sludge its thick , pudding - like consistency in this case is known as fly ash , which results from the combustion of coal			2
fly ash contains concentrated amounts of mercury , arsenic and benzine , said @entity100 , staff attorney for the @entity101			0
" these things are naturally occurring , but they concentrate in the burning process and the residual is more toxic than it starts , " she told @entity0			2
@entity106 environmentalists compared the mess with another spill eight years ago in eastern @entity109 , where the bottom of a coal sludge impoundment owned by @entity112 broke into an abandoned underground mine , oozing more than 300 million gallons of coal waste into tributaries			1
the water supply for more than 25,000 residents was contaminated , and aquatic life in the area perished			2
it took months to clean up the spill			0
" if the estimates are correct , this spill is one and a half times bigger , " said @entity125 , an environmental advocate with the @entity127 , a traveling program that explains the effect of an extreme form of mining			2
while the full scope of the @entity18 spill is being determined , coal critics are already concerned about its long - term effects			0
cleaning up the mess , which could fill nearly 800 @entity139 - size swimming pools , could take months or years , @entity100 said			0
" we 're very concerned about how long it 's going to take " to clean the spill , she told @entity0			0
@entity125 agreed , saying , " it 's 4 , 5 feet deep			0
how are you going to scoop it up ? where are you going to put it ? "			0

@entity150 breach sends sludge downhill , causing damage to 15 homes
spokesman says 400 acres are coated by more than 500 million gallons of sludge
area *affected* is bigger than @entity42 , spokesman says
footage shows dead fish , but sludge ca n't be deemed toxic until tests are done
