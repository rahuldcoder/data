-- @entity2 supporters launched a counteroffensive this week against claims that documents related to the @entity7 attack investigation were sanitized and ahead of another congressional hearing			1
a @entity10 spokesman responded quickly to the story released monday , calling it " patently false , " and a group helping with the former secretary of state 's communications and rapid response mobilized an entire communications strategy , website and talking points around the issue			1
the strategy has a directness that has not always been seen from @entity10 aides and affiliated groups , which have generally waited for a story to fully emerge before taking it on			1
a @entity28 - led @entity27 on the @entity7 attack holds its first public meeting wednesday , with seven @entity31 and five @entity32 looking into the september 11 , 2012 , attack on the @entity35 compound in @entity36 that killed four @entity35 , including ambassador @entity37			1
the issue has been white hot politically since then			2
it loomed as an issue that @entity31 used against president @entity41 in the closing months of the 2012 election , and with the prospect of @entity10 running for president in 2016 , the issue has continued to burn			1
@entity45 : if @entity2 worked for @entity10 , she 'd be fired @entity47 , who resigned from her job as a @entity50 correspondent in 2014 for what she said was liberal bias , published a report monday alleging that a @entity55 official close to @entity10 had withheld and sanitized documents during the department investigation			1
the story , which many conservative outlets branded as a " bombshell , " was hung on deputy assistant secretary @entity61 , one of the men reprimanded over the attack			2
the @entity55 flatly denied the story			0
the @entity68 " had full and direct access to @entity55 employees and documents			0
any accounts to the contrary like that one you mentioned are completely without merit , completely ill - informed , " said @entity69 , the department 's deputy spokeswoman			0
" these reports show a complete lack of understanding of how the @entity68 functioned			0
it collected its own documents directly from anybody in the department			0
there was a department - wide call for information to be given directly to the @entity68			0
" @entity86 , @entity10 's spokesman , followed up tuesday with a statement to @entity0			2
" this is patently false , as the @entity55 said yesterday about the process that allowed unfettered access to the @entity68			0
" correct the @entity95 , the outside group handling communications for @entity10 and urging her to run for president in 2016 , launched a rapid response the same day " to rebut , fact check , and respond to the upcoming @entity99 hearings			1
" the effort includes a website -- @entity102 -- that highlights statements from the group , points out questions already addressed by past @entity7 panels and fact - checks some critics ' claims			1
the group says it hopes to model its response after the way campaigns respond during debates			0
" the loss of life in @entity7 was a tragedy but the questions of what happened that night have already been asked and answered , " the group said in an email			2
" republicans have no credibility on this issue and are wasting taxpayer dollars on these sham hearings to ask questions that have already been answered , all for political gain : both to drive up their base turnout in 2014 and to go after @entity2 for 2016			2
" @entity7 probe presses ahead despite new report @entity10 has taken responsibility in the attacks and has told a number of groups that it was her biggest regret at the @entity55			1
in her memoir , " @entity147 , " she knocks those " who exploit " @entity7 for political gain and says , " those who insist on politicizing the tragedy will have to do so without me			2
" the passage is considered a flat no to any suggestion that @entity10 would testify before the @entity27 's latest @entity7 committee			1
despite that , committee chairman rep. @entity152 , @entity154 - @entity153 , is undeterred from proceeding with the investigation			0
a statement tuesday from the committee said , " as chairman @entity152 has said , he is willing to risk answering the same question twice rather than risk it not be answered at all			0
" @entity0 's @entity161 contributed to this report .			0
