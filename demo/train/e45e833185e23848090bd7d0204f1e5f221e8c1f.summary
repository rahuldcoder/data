-- the pilots hardly had time to react			1
two streaks of light shot past their plane as it climbed into the skies above @entity7 in @entity8			2
fortunately for the hundreds of tourists on board , the two @entity10 surface - to - air missiles ( @entity11 ) fired by terrorists from a hillside close to the airport missed their target			2
minutes later and thousands of feet below , more than a dozen people were killed in a bomb attack on an @entity21 - owned hotel , the second part of a coordinated attack carried out by @entity24 in november 2002			1
it remains the only record of @entity24 firing @entity27 on a passenger jet			1
but if the president of @entity31 is right , the terrorist group may just have acquired another batch			1
president @entity33 has told the magazine @entity34 ( @entity35 ) that @entity24 's @entity37 affiliate -- @entity38 ( @entity38 ) -- has taken advantage of unrest in @entity41 to seize @entity42 from military stockpiles in rebel - held areas			1
he claimed that the missiles had already been " exfiltrated " by the @entity38 from @entity41 and taken to the group 's sanctuaries in the @entity50 region of north and northwestern @entity52			2
" it 's a very serious situation , " he added			2
" @entity38 is on the way to becoming a veritable army , the best equipped in the region			2
" @entity57 said he was " 100 % sure " of the information , but @entity60 military officials have not publicly weighed in on the claim			2
when asked about the reports during testimony before @entity67 tuesday , adm. @entity68 , the @entity64 supreme allied commander in @entity69 , said he would respond in closed session			2
there are certainly plenty of @entity27 in @entity41			2
video and photographs have shown rebel fighters posing with shoulder - fired surface to air missiles including sa - 7s , the same type fired in @entity8			0
the @entity10 is a 1960s - era @entity81 - made missile , later distributed to insurgents fighting @entity81 troops in @entity84 by the @entity85 in order to disguise their true origin			0
but analysts doubt that @entity38 has obtained such missiles			0
@entity57 offered no concrete evidence -- in public at least -- to back up his claims			1
he may also have an interest in playing up the @entity24 threat in his own backyard			1
counterterrorism analysts say that @entity57 did not add to his credibility when he said there was some truth to @entity107 's assertion that @entity24 was orchestrating the @entity41 rebellion , a claim for which no evidence has surfaced			1
@entity68 said in his testimony that only " flickers " of @entity24 activity had been detected in eastern @entity41			1
given relatively high rates of @entity115 radicalization in eastern @entity41 in recent years , it is possible that @entity24 sympathizers in rebel ranks could have transferred weapons to @entity38			1
but it seems unlikely because the rebels ' overwhelming motivation is to topple the @entity107 regime			0
a more plausible scenario sees @entity38 buying missiles on the very substantial black market in weapons in @entity127			1
according to @entity133 , a researcher at the @entity134 who closely tracks @entity38 , the organization 's significant revenues from kidnapping , drug smuggling and human trafficking mean that it has the money to buy @entity42			1
" if , and it 's a big if , @entity38 really did get hold of surface to air missiles and transport them all the way down to @entity52 , their main rationale would likely be to use them to defend against helicopter raids on their camps by @entity145 and other special forces teams in the area			0
@entity38 appears to have already acquired some anti-aircraft weapons			1
@entity149 , an expert on @entity38 , wrote in the february edition of @entity151 , published by @entity152 's @entity151 , that @entity38 has used its rising revenues to purchase @entity155 ( @entity155 ) .50 caliber anti-aircraft machine guns on the black market , possibly from @entity127			1
@entity38 has been traditionally weak in @entity41 , according to @entity157 , a former @entity41 jihadist who is now a senior researcher at the @entity158 , a @entity160 - based counterterrorism think tank			0
the group 's leadership is mainly @entity164 , and its foot soldiers are being increasingly drawn from the @entity167 region of @entity168 , @entity52 and @entity169			0
but there are signs that its horizons are broadening			0
according to a recent briefing paper on @entity41 co-authored by @entity157 , up to 40 @entity41 have joined the group in the last two or three years			0
and in 2009 , @entity176 , one of the @entity41 leader 's sons , told @entity0 's @entity179 that several @entity41 had joined @entity38 's ranks in @entity164 and @entity168			0
according to @entity157 , @entity38 decided to start infiltrating @entity41 after the fall of the @entity183 regime in january , after years of avoiding the country because of @entity107 's intimidating security apparatus			0
he wrote that " in early january 2011 , two @entity41 @entity38 members left their bases in northern @entity168 and travelled via southern @entity164 into @entity41			0
arriving in @entity188 , a remote desert city in @entity41 's extreme south - west on 15 january , they were involved in a shootout with @entity41 security forces , killing one policeman , before being killed themselves			0
this is @entity38 's first known armed operation in @entity41			0
" @entity0 has not been able to independently verify the incident			0
last week sheikh @entity194 , the head of @entity38 , reacted to @entity196 airstrikes by issuing a video statement denouncing the intervention as a " modern crusade " and promising to work to remove it			0
the @entity10 may not be @entity201 , but it has proven crudely effective over the years			0
sa - 7s were among the weapons deployed by @entity205 insurgents to bring down several @entity60 military helicopters in @entity205			1
while most military aircraft are equipped with counter-measures , civilian planes generally are not			0
western counterterrorism officials say they are concerned about the flood of weapons from @entity41 garrisons now in circulation and the difficulty of tracking them			1
most are not as dangerous as @entity42 , but some just may be .			1

@entity31 president claims @entity37 affiliate has stolen some @entity42
no concrete evidence yet of this
but @entity24 known to have enough funds for weapons black market
