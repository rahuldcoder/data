@entity0 , @entity1 -- an advisory panel is recommending a major step up in protection for health workers dealing with patients suspected or confirmed to have h1n1 influenza			2
one expert says that based on current knowledge , @entity11 respirators offer health workers the best protection			1
the @entity15 said thursday , in recommendations requested by the @entity17 , that loose paper masks are inadequate because the workers could still breathe in the virus			2
instead , health workers should switch to n95 respirators that form an airtight seal around the nose and mouth			1
if properly fitted and worn correctly , @entity11 respirators filter out at least 95 percent of particles as small as 0.3 micrometers , which is smaller than influenza viruses , the report notes			1
the institute provides independent , evidence - based advice to policymakers , health professionals , private entities and the public			0
it is one of four groups that make up the @entity39			0
the study released thursday was requested by the @entity17 and the @entity41			0
" scientists do not know to what extent flu viruses spread through the air or whether infection requires physical contact with contaminated fluids or surfaces , " a summary of the report says			1
it calls for " a boost in research to answer these questions and to design and develop better protective equipment that would enhance workers ' comfort , safety and ability to do their jobs			0
" " based on what we currently know about influenza , well - fitted @entity11 respirators offer health care workers the best protection against inhalation of viral particles , " said committee chairman @entity62 , executive vice chancellor for health affairs at the @entity65 in @entity66			1
he is a former president of the institute			0
" but there is a lot we still do n't know about these viruses , and it would be a mistake for anyone to rely on respirators alone as some sort of magic shield			2
" health care workers should use several strategies to guard against infection , such as innovative triage processes , washing hands , disinfecting , wearing gloves , getting vaccinated and using antiviral drugs , @entity62 said			1
the institute was asked specifically to evaluate personal protective equipment designed to guard against respiratory infection , and therefore the committee focused on the efficacy of medical masks and respirators .			0
