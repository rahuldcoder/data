-- a spokeswoman for a group headed by @entity4 laureate @entity3 has been arrested by @entity6 authorities less than 48 hours before the country marks the first anniversary of its election fallout , according to a human rights group			1
@entity14 , a member of @entity3 's @entity15 -- known as @entity6 's leading human rights group -- was arrested overnight at her @entity18 home , the @entity13 - based @entity12 reported friday			1
no information is available about the arrest of @entity14 , whose whereabouts are unknown , said @entity22 , a spokesman for the campaign			2
@entity22 noted that a television program on an official @entity6 station aired a segment friday attacking @entity3 's character and her human rights record			1
the program included clips of @entity3 's husband , who was arrested after the june 12 , 2009 , elections and released , making disparaging remarks about his wife			1
her husband , @entity38 , was " subjected to physical and psychological abuse " while he was detained , the @entity36 in @entity6 said			1
" he was videotaped while in detention and coerced to make defamatory statements about her			0
he informed @entity3 about his ill treatment after his release			2
" @entity3 , who was awarded the @entity4 in 2003 , has been a vocal critic of @entity6 's human rights record , especially in the aftermath of last year 's election			1
thousands were arrested during the mass demonstrations that followed -- including former lawmakers , political activists , local and international journalists , filmmakers and foreign nationals -- and hundreds were accused of engaging in a " soft revolution " and tried in court			0
in a commentary published on @entity0 friday , @entity3 stated , " most recently , in order to put more pressure on political and social dissidents , and in addition to regular arrests , the @entity6 government has resorted to other tactics			1
for example , the government has been taking hostage and imprisoning the close relatives of these individuals to inflict more intimidation and psychological pressure , in order to have their demands met			0
" she named her sister , @entity3 , a dentistry professor who was detained for 17 days in december , among the examples of those arrested without cause			1
the @entity78 government has steadily been tightening its grip throughout the year , said a report issued thursday by @entity81 , a group that also has been monitoring the situation through interviews with people in @entity6			1
the government and police have issued warnings to @entity6 not to participate in any gatherings saturday , and opposition leaders called off protests to mark the anniversary for fear of another crackdown			2
@entity81 said the atmosphere inside the country is markedly different from the images of defiance that filled the internet and television screens starting a year ago			0
" while the international community has focused on @entity6 's nuclear ambitions , @entity18 has been methodically crushing all forms of dissent inside the country , " @entity100 , deputy @entity101 director at @entity81 , told @entity0 this week			2
" journalists , lawyers , and civil society activists who used to speak to foreign media and human rights groups are increasingly reluctant , fearing phone and internet surveillance , " he said in a statement released with the latest report			0
the rights group says @entity6 's crackdown extends beyond election protesters			1
the 19 - page report lists abuses including arbitrary arrests , extrajudicial killings , rapes , torture and violations of the rights to freedom of assembly and expression			0
scores of journalists and human rights activists have been targeted , the report says , and the government has executed at least seven @entity136 political dissidents , while more than a dozen sit on death row			0
@entity6 has defended its record before the @entity139			2
@entity140 , the secretary general of @entity6 's @entity141 , has said that the government goes after only those who incite violence			2
" nobody is jailed because of the protest , " @entity140 said in february			0
" the only reason for jailing is the violence which was attached with the protests			0
any government has a duty to bring an end to the violence			0
i think the beating of our police is much more less than the @entity160 and @entity161 police			0
