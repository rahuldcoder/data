editor 's note : @entity2 , a primary care physician in @entity4 , @entity5 , blogs at @entity6 dr. @entity2 says health reform ca n't succeed as long as there 's a shortage of primary care doctors			1
( @entity11 ) -- when president @entity12 recently cited the number of @entity14 without health insurance , he declared that , " we are not a nation that accepts nearly 46 million uninsured men , women , and children			0
" uninsured patients often delay preventive care , waiting to seek medical attention only when their conditions worsen			1
this leads to more intensive treatment , often in the emergency department or hospital where costs run the highest			0
@entity31 health coverage is therefore a sensible goal , and the reforms being considered all make considerable effort to provide everyone with affordable health care			1
but expanding coverage can not succeed as long as there remains a shortage of primary care clinicians			2
after all , what good is having health insurance if you ca n't find a doctor to see you ? @entity45 is often held out as a model for national health reform , and the bills being considered in @entity49 emulate much of that state 's 2006 landmark universal coverage law			1
as a physician in neighboring @entity5 , i have had the opportunity to observe the effect of the @entity45 reforms			2
today , 97 percent of @entity45 residents have health insurance , the highest in the country			2
but less publicized are the unintended consequences that the influx of half a million newly insured patients has had on an unprepared primary care system			1
the @entity64 reported that the average wait time for a new patient looking for a primary care doctor ranged from 36 to 50 days , with almost half of internal medicine physicians closing their doors entirely to new patients			2
and when you consider that @entity45 already has the highest concentration of doctors nationwide , wait times will likely be worse in other , less physician - abundant parts of the country , should universal coverage be enacted federally			1
when patients are forced to wait weeks to obtain medical care , they inevitably find their way into the emergency department for treatment that ordinarily can be handled in a doctor 's office			1
indeed , since health reform was passed , according to state data provided to the @entity89 , @entity45 emergency rooms have reported a 7 percent increase in volume , which markedly inflates costs when you consider that emergency room treatment can be up to 10 times more expensive than an office visit for the same ailment			1
@entity98 , a spokeswoman for the nonpartisan @entity100 , told @entity101 that expanding coverage without improving access to care is a " recipe for failure , " as well as unsustainable , " because it will just bankrupt us			2
" @entity45 is finding out just how difficult it is to fiscally maintain universal coverage			1
in part due to soaring health costs , the state legislature has proposed reducing health benefits for 30,000 legal immigrants and cutting funding to inner - city hospitals like @entity115 , which , according to the @entity89 , may " force it to slash programs and jeopardize care for thousands of poverty - stricken families			0
" the success of universal health coverage depends on an adequate supply of primary care providers			0
but the @entity124 is forecasting a shortage of 46,000 primary care physicians by 2025 , a deficit that not only will balloon under any universal coverage measure , but can not be made up as doctors , nurse practitioners and physician assistants all gravitate towards more lucrative specialty practice			1
it 's not only the financial incentives that need to substantially change for primary care to prosper			0
more important , the working conditions for the physicians already in the field have to improve			0
a recent survey in the @entity140 found that roughly half of primary care doctors reported practicing in a work environment " strongly associated with low physician satisfaction , high stress ... and [ an ] intent to leave			1
" primary care clinicians routinely face unreasonable time pressures , a chaotic work pace , and bureaucratic impediments			0
onerous paperwork requirements that obstruct patient care have to be reduced			0
and instead of the current system which encourages doctors to rush through as many office visits as possible , physicians who take the time to counsel , guide , and address all of their patients ' concerns should be rewarded			2
better valuing the doctor - patient relationship will increase satisfaction , not only for physicians , but for their patients as well			0
such solutions , however , have been largely absent from the health reform conversation			0
although it is a moral imperative for every @entity14 to have access to health insurance , alleviating the shortage of primary care providers is of equal importance			0
the prospect of suddenly adding tens of millions of patients to an overburdened primary care system has the potential to make the already dire state of @entity14 health care even worse			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity2 : it 's important to extend coverage to the uninsured
he says reform ca n't work if there are n't enough doctors to care for all
@entity2 says @entity45 is finding it ca n't provide care to those newly covered
*pho* : adding tens of millions of patients could strain system
