-- in a little more than three months , @entity1 probably will be drafted by an @entity3 team and sign a multimillion dollar deal			1
before teams sink that much money into players , they have questions			0
with the revelation that the football feel - good story of the year centered on the @entity16 linebacker 's love for a woman who never existed , many people have questions for @entity1 -- a lot of questions			1
and as each question in the saga gets answered -- none publicly by @entity1 --- it seems another one , or two , or three , crop up			1
for instance , why did @entity1 tell reporters before the @entity28 presentation on december 8 that he " lost both my grandparents and my girlfriend to cancer , " when two days earlier the woman he thought was dead called him on his cellphone ? why did he tell a @entity35 reporter in october that @entity36 came to one of his games then issue a statement this week that he never met her ? who is now behind the one of the @entity42 accounts associated with @entity36 , a woman who apparently never lived , let alone died , in september before @entity1 , who called her his girlfriend , played one of the biggest games of the young season ? the @entity1 hoax in 30 posts a tweet thursday purportedly from the fictional girlfriend promised she would have a big announcement that would help sort out details of the story , but the tweet was merely a joke about @entity1			1
two other tweets on the page were retweets from the verified account of @entity1			1
" @ lennaykay i miss you ! " a november 6 tweet from @entity1 said			1
on september 12 , @entity1 tweeted " @ @entity65 you will always be with me wherever i go ! " it was unclear thursday whether the person @entity1 tweeted to in september used it again after reports broke of a hoax or whether someone created a new account with the same user name			1
the airing of the bizarre story began wednesday , when sports website @entity77 published a piece dismissing as a hoax the existence of @entity1 's girlfriend -- the one who he said died around the same time as his grandmother while his team marched toward the @entity86			1
then wednesday , the university held a news conference saying @entity1 was the victim of a " elaborate hoax			1
" and @entity1 , the @entity28 runner - up , released a statement saying he was embarrassed that he was the victim of a " sick joke			1
" the bizarre developments left many wondering if they , instead of @entity1 , were led on			1
" @entity1 's story that he is completely innocent in this does not really ring true to us , " @entity95 , co-author of the @entity77 article , told @entity0 's @entity97 on wednesday night			1
@entity101 , the @entity35 writer who published a transcript of his interview with @entity1 , said he thinks the star linebacker was duped			1
" if he was acting he deserves an @entity106 nomination , " @entity101 said			0
" the depth and the detail of this scam is mindboggling , but i do think @entity1 ... he caught the wave of this story , maybe exaggerated the depths of their relationship a little			1
but at the end of the day , we need to hear from @entity1			1
" doubters wonder if @entity28 a factor in hoax the hoax the story of the girlfriend came to light in september as @entity16 continued its improbable undefeated season , and @entity1 , a relentless tackler , was beginning to emerge as a front - runner for the prestigous @entity28			1
he led the @entity126 , amassing double - digit tackle games and becoming the face of one of the best defenses in the nation			0
in september and october , @entity1 told interviewers that his girlfriend and grandmother had died within hours of each other			2
the girlfriend , a 22 - year - old @entity137 student , died of leukemia , he said			0
the twin losses inspired him to honor them with sterling play on the field , @entity1 said			2
he led his team to a 20 - 3 routing of @entity145 after he heard the news			0
" i miss ' em , but i know that i 'll see them again one day , " he told @entity147			0
opinion : @entity1 tale a mirror to our gullibility ? it was indeed a gripping interest story of determination			2
and the media ran with it			0
no one bothered to seek out @entity36 's family until @entity77 , acting on an anonymous e-mail received last week , started poking around			2
" what do you do when you first want to know something ? you @entity164 it , right ? " @entity95 said on @entity0			0
" and @entity164 searches for ' @entity36 ' only showed up articles about her dying , and inspiring @entity1			1
" there 's no evidence of her existing in any way , other than , you know , after she had allegedly died			0
and we thought that was a little weird			0
" @entity1 's grandmother died in september , @entity77 said			2
but there was no @entity181 record of @entity36 's death			2
the birth and @entity184 in @entity185 , @entity186 , told @entity0 it had no record of @entity188 , nor does the county coroner			0
@entity77 called mortuaries and funeral homes in @entity192 , @entity186 , where @entity36 was reportedly buried -- but came up empty			2
the website sought out the person whose picture had been presented as that of @entity188 and tracked her down			0
timeline : how the story unfolded she was alive , did n't have leukemia and had never met @entity1			1
" that sort of opened everything up , " @entity95 said			0
the revelation prompted the @entity16 athletics director to call a news conference wednesday			2
there was no way for @entity1 to know the relationship was a hoax because it had been conducted strictly online and on the phone , said director @entity211			1
the pair had set up several meetings , including in @entity214 , where @entity1 grew up -- but @entity36 never showed , @entity211 said			1
the university said it did not know how many people were in on the ruse			0
according to @entity211 , @entity1 received a call from a woman claiming to be his girlfriend on december 6 , telling him she was not dead			1
those calls continued , but @entity1 did not answer , he said			2
the @entity28 was awarded two days later , and @entity1 made comments about losing relatives to cancer before he finished second in the award voting to quarterback @entity226 of @entity227 the @entity137 registrar 's office told @entity0 that it has never had a student registered in @entity36 's name or using an alternate spelling			1
" outside of a few @entity42 and @entity235 accounts , there 's no online evidence that @entity36 ever existed , " @entity77 contends			2
" there was no @entity36			2
" te'o in his own words her ' soulful eyes ' so , how did the two fall in love ? according to the @entity244 in @entity245 -- the newspaper of @entity16 's hometown , the two met -- yes , met -- after a football game in @entity248 , @entity186 , in 2009			1
" their stares got pleasantly tangled , then @entity1 extended his hand to the stranger with a warm smile and soulful eyes , " the paper gushed			2
" they could have just as easily brushed past each other and into separate sunsets			0
@entity1 had plenty to preoccupy himself that november weekend in @entity248 , @entity186 , back in 2009			2
" the article went on to say : " @entity36 was a @entity137 student and cardinal football fan when the two exchanged glances , handshakes and phone numbers that fateful weekend three seasons ago			1
" @entity1 's father , @entity266 , was quoted in the article : " they started out as just friends			0
every once in a while , she would travel to @entity214 , and that happened to be the time @entity1 was home , so he would meet with her there			0
but within the last year , they became a couple			0
" the newspaper said wednesday it based @entity277 's story on information from the linebacker , his family members and coaches -- and moved the story to its archives			0
but as @entity101 reported thursday , @entity1 said they met through a cousin			1
" the only time he did n't speak with confidence was when i asked how they met , " he wrote			0
i did n't press him , as it was clearly something he did n't want to share			0
i suspected they may have met online , understood he would n't have wanted that public and moved on			0
" media reports indicate the parents never met @entity36			1
social media jump all over story @entity1 was in @entity299 training for the @entity300 , where draft prospects showcase their abilities for teams			0
he did n't meet with reporters or answer phone calls to his room on thursday			0
he tried to clear things up with a statement wednesday saying he " developed an emotional relationship with a woman i met online			1
" " we maintained what i thought to be an authentic relationship by communicating frequently online and on the phone , and i grew to care deeply about her , " he said in the statement			0
" to realize that i was the victim of what was apparently someone 's sick joke and constant lies was , and is , painful and humiliating , " the statement continued			0
" it further pains me that the grief i felt and the sympathies expressed to me at the time of my grandmother 's death in september were in any way deepened by what i believed to be another significant loss in my life			0
" share your online dating experience with @entity334 who 's who on the @entity337 ? who knows @entity0 's @entity339 and @entity340 contributed to this report .			0
