@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 announced plans friday to charge for access to @entity6 and the @entity8 web sites starting in june			1
the publisher said both @entity11 newspapers will launch new web sites in early may and offer a free trial period to registered customers			1
starting in june , each site will charge £ 1 ( $ 1.48 ) for a day 's access or £ 2 ( $ 2.96 ) for a week 's subscription , @entity3 said			1
the newspapers are currently available free on a combined site , www.timesonline.co.uk , but they will have separate sites starting in may			2
subscribers will have access to both sites , @entity3 said			1
" at a defining moment for journalism , this is a crucial step towards making the business of news an economically exciting proposition , " said @entity25 , chief executive at @entity3			2
" we are proud of our journalism and unashamed to say that we believe it has value			0
" would you pay to read your news on the web ? the only other major @entity11 newspaper currently charging for online content is the @entity41 , which charges a basic rate of £ 3.29 ( $ 4.90 ) a week for a year - long subscription			1
users can view up to 10 online articles for free each month , but they must register			2
in its @entity47 blog , the @entity41 said " this experiment will be closely watched by the embattled media industry			0
" the paper 's digital media correspondent @entity52 wrote there are already doubts about the success of the paid - for plan			0
" the wide availability of free news online has led many to question whether paywalls can attract substantial numbers of customers , " @entity52 wrote			0
" in the @entity11 , newspapers face online competition from the @entity64 , which earlier this month pledged to curtail the scope of its web sites			1
" @entity68 , of @entity3 , said the company expects to attract a growing base of customers with the online subscriptions			1
she also indicated the plan could be extended to cover the company 's other two @entity11 titles , tabloids @entity76 and @entity77			1
" this is just the start , " @entity68 said			0
@entity8 editor @entity79 said the planned subscription price will be a bargain , costing about the same as a cup of coffee			0
comments on the story in the @entity87 section of @entity89 's web site -- which is free -- were mixed			2
" bye bye to the @entity6 then , " wrote a user named rocketracer			0
" this goes against the basic principle of the internet which is about increasing access to information not restricting it			0
" another user called jodro wrote , " much as it pains me to say it , like everyone i like things for free , but some kind of @entity105 payment structure is the only way to rescue quality journalism and an independent press that can counterbalance the increasing powers that technological developments hand to governments worldwide			0
" last year @entity112 , the chairman and ceo of @entity3 's parent company @entity114 , said the current free access business model favored by most content providers was flawed			1
" we are now in the midst of an epochal debate over the value of content and it is clear to many newspapers that the current model is malfunctioning , " he said			0
@entity112 said the experience of the @entity114 - owned @entity126 had proved that charging for content could be made to work			2
he said 360,000 people had downloaded an @entity131 application in three weeks			0
users would soon be made to pay " handsomely " for accessing @entity126 content , he added			0
the media tycoon has also repeatedly threatened to pull his company 's news web sites from @entity137 and put all company sites that are currently free behind a pay wall			1
@entity137 strengthens news content walls his international newspaper empire includes the @entity143 , the @entity3 stable of @entity11 titles including the @entity76 and the @entity8 , and a cluster of @entity148 papers including the @entity149 and the @entity150 his comments come with the @entity153 newspaper industry in a state of crisis amid plunging advertising revenues and falling circulations with several historic titles already going out of business .			1
