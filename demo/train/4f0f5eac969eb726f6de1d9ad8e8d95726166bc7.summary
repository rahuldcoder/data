@entity1 , @entity0 -- over and over thursday , president @entity3 told workers at a renewable energy company that he is like them			1
he remembers pumping gas when high oil prices ate a hole in his budget , he said			0
he knows he would n't have made it through college without scholarships and loans			0
and now as president , he promised that he wo n't let the current debate on deficit reduction deny others the chance for the @entity20 dream he has lived			1
" we ca n't ignore future deficits , but just as ignoring deficits would mortgage our future , failing to invest in our kids and our infrastructure and our basic research and clean energy , that would be mortgaging our future , as well , " he said to applause			2
" and i 'm not willing to do it			0
" it was the third town hall - style meeting in three days for @entity3 , after an event tuesday at @entity36 and a gathering wednesday at @entity39 headquarters in @entity40 , @entity41			1
his trip also has included a series of fundraising events just over two weeks after he announced he will seek re-election in 2012			2
speaking thursday at @entity46 , a 45 - employee company that produces electric power without using fuel or emitting carbon dioxide , @entity3 advocated federal spending on education , research and infrastructure development such as road and bridge repairs , high - speed rail lines and broadband wireless networks			1
he appeared to be trying out campaign themes for the 2012 race , repeatedly framing the debate in @entity61 as a choice between helping working - class families and society 's most vulnerable elements or favoring moneyed interests he labeled as big oil and big banks			1
repeating past calls for ending subsidies for oil companies and restoring higher tax rates for the highest - income @entity20 , @entity3 defended what he called his balanced approach to deficit reduction and depicted the @entity78 stance as favoring the well - to - do			1
" i 'm rooting for everybody to get rich , " he said			0
" but i believe that we ca n't ask everybody to sacrifice and then tell the wealthiest among us , well , you can just relax and go count your money , and do n't worry about it			0
we 're not going to ask anything of you			0
" @entity3 went on to say that he had been " incredibly blessed by this country , " noting he was raised by a single mother and needed scholarships to get through school			1
" we want to make sure this is a country where , if you 're willing to try hard , you can make it , where everybody has a chance at prosperity , " he said			2
" that 's my focus			2
that 's my guiding light			0
" @entity3 's blitz comes as @entity102 faces two major fiscal issues in coming months : passing a budget for fiscal year 2012 , which begins october 1 , and raising the federal debt ceiling so the government can continue meeting its obligations			1
while the issues are not necessarily linked , congressional republicans are demanding significant fiscal reforms , such as a balanced budget amendment and mandatory spending caps , in exchange for their necessary support to raise the debt limit			0
republicans will not move forward on a measure to raise the country 's debt ceiling unless " it is accompanied by serious reforms that immediately reduce federal spending and end the culture of debt in @entity61 , " @entity118 majority leader @entity117 , @entity119 , said this week			1
@entity3 and @entity128 want to separate the debt ceiling and fiscal reform issues to avoid spooking markets and trade partners , arguing that such a vital issue should be free of any possible political drag			1
while opposing a direct linkage between raising the debt ceiling and fiscal reforms , the @entity118 concedes that simultaneous steps are needed to reduce mounting deficits and the national debt			0
the @entity20 debt is expected to hit the country 's $ 14.3 trillion ceiling next month , though congressional leaders say the @entity145 can take steps to put off the deadline until early july			1
on the broader fiscal reform issues , @entity3 noted thursday that both his proposal and the @entity118 @entity78 plan acknowledge the problem posed by expanding deficits and the growing national debt , and that both call for $ 4 trillion in deficit reduction in the next decade or so			1
the @entity118 plan would overhaul @entity156 and @entity157 , cut non-military discretionary spending and reform the tax code to lower rates and eliminate loopholes			0
the goal is leaner government without the unsustainable cost increases currently plaguing @entity156 and @entity157 , along with lower tax rates to stimulate economic growth			0
@entity3 's vision , unveiled last week , includes ending the tax cuts for the wealthy , further reforms to @entity156 and @entity157 , and cutting military spending			1
the @entity118 @entity78 plan would leave military spending untouched			0
vice president @entity174 's office announced monday that his first meeting with legislators to try to work out a fiscal reform deal will take place may 5			2
@entity3 proposed the talks when he outlined his policy last week , and @entity78 leaders announced tuesday that @entity117 and sen. @entity182 of @entity183 will represent them			2
at the same time , a bipartisan group of senators known as the " @entity186 " is nearing consensus on its own comprehensive reform plan based on the report issued last december by a deficit reduction commission appointed by @entity3			2
no details have been made public , but the @entity193 's report in december included reforms of entitlements including @entity196 , @entity156 and @entity157 while also calling for revenue increases through tax reform and spending cuts , including in the military budget			0
@entity2 's @entity201 contributed to this story .			0
