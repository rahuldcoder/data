@entity0 , @entity1 -- two doctors who treated @entity4 in the months before her death and her lawyer - boyfriend go on trial wednesday on charges they illegally conspired to provide the actress with drugs			1
@entity11 , the lead lawyer for @entity12 , said the defense team was " very pleased " with the jury of six men and six women who were sworn in tuesday afternoon			0
opening statements were scheduled for wednesday morning			0
lawyers predicted the trial in @entity20 could last up to three months			1
potential jurors were asked more than 100 questions , including personal questions about their prescription drug use			2
@entity4 's boyfriend @entity12 , along with drs. @entity25 and @entity26 , face 23 felony charges , including three counts of conspiracy to dispense and administer controlled substances to a known addict			1
the three also are accused of conspiring to use false names to obtain drugs for @entity4 , a practice defense attorneys have argued was intended to protect the celebrity 's privacy			1
@entity4 died february 8 , 2007 , from what a @entity38 medical examiner ruled was " acute combined drug intoxication			1
" judge @entity41 dismissed several jurors because of what he called " language problems " or because they expressed opinions suggesting they had already concluded guilt in the case			0
the judge described one juror as " dull " and predicted she would become a problem if allowed on the jury			0
judge @entity41 ruled at the end of a 13 - day preliminary hearing last fall that there was probable cause to try @entity12 and the two doctors for involvement in an alleged conspiracy to provide drugs to a known addict			2
" evidence in the record strongly suggests she was an addict , " he said			0
@entity41 said " there was a widespread and ongoing effort " to obtain drugs for @entity4 , whom he characterized as a " strong - willed person " intent on getting drugs			1
the doctors may have been " blinded by the celebrity of their patient , " @entity41 said			2
a defense lawyer said the case could have a chilling effect on doctors who treat patients for pain , since the doctors could be held criminally liable if their prescriptions are deemed excessive			2
witnesses described @entity4 as weak and " zombie - like " much of the time in the months after september 11 , 2006 , when her 20 - year - old son died in the @entity87 hospital room where she was recovering from the birth of her daughter			1
@entity11 argued that @entity12 should not be charged because he did not know his companion was an addict or that it was illegal to obtain medication with a prescription written out to a false name			0
" he 's being charged here with doctor - related activities , which doctors have specific knowledge of and he 's just a layperson , " @entity11 told the judge			1
prosecution witnesses outlined evidence that the doctors wrote many prescriptions using several names , including @entity12 's , for drugs intended for @entity4			1
" one of their theories is that the mere prescribing of medications using a pseudonym is a crime and it 's rebutted by the fact that some of the most respected hospitals in this city use this practice to protect the privacy of some of their celebrity patients , " @entity25 defense lawyer @entity107 said			0
prosecutors argued that @entity12 used the false names to get double doses of dangerous drugs to feed the addiction of the former @entity130 model and reality tv star			0
@entity26 's lawyer said prosecutors could make it difficult for @entity1 doctors to treat their patients for pain			2
" if this prosecution is successful , you can all plan to call the @entity141 office every time you ask your doctor for a prescription for pain , because that 's going to be the standard , " attorney @entity137 said			0
@entity41 agreed with @entity107 's argument that @entity25 , a psychiatrist , " deeply cared for @entity4 and was well intentioned " with her treatment			1
" i made that observation , " the judge said .			0

two doctors and @entity4 's boyfriend are charged
the trial could last 3 months
@entity4 died in 2007 of " drug intoxication "
