-- the goal of @entity2 is laudable : give all students a common experience in @entity5 and math. but the path to that end has been fraught with problems			1
for one thing , more parents and educators are upset over all the tests students now have to take			1
teachers are concerned about the negative impact of teaching to the test			0
supporters of @entity2 insist the standards and tests are necessary for holding schools accountable and ensuring a better future for @entity23			1
but they may want to take a page from @entity25 , which has experienced the good , bad and ugly of a testing culture			1
for over a thousand years , @entity25 emperors used the imperial exam system keju to select government officials			2
when the great empire was shattered by @entity33 powers in the 19th century , @entity30 was blamed for @entity25 's failure to cultivate the creative and diverse talents needed for modernization			1
it was officially ended in 1905			0
but the keju spirit lives on today in the body of the college entrance exam , or gaokao			0
because it is practically the only way for upward social mobility , gaokao wields as much power as keju			0
it orients all aspects of education at all levels toward preparing for the exam			0
as a result , the modern day education system in @entity25 remains a test - prep machine as it was in the days of keju			1
@entity25 has certainly benefited from high - stakes testing and a focused common curriculum			2
the imperial exam system did a perfect job in cultivating obedient and homogeneous intellectuals , who contributed to @entity25 's continuous pre-eminence as an agricultural empire			1
the modern - day test - prep education has produced the best test - takers in the world			1
students from @entity67 have twice ranked no. 1 on the @entity69 , or @entity69 , earning @entity25 the reputation of having one of the best education systems in the world			2
why @entity75 's schools are top - notch the @entity25 system has also produced many extremely hardworking , highly motivated and excellent professionals			1
it 's true that the very best ones are sought after by @entity81 companies			0
but they are a tiny fraction			0
one study shows that fewer than 10 % of @entity25 graduates would be qualified to work in a foreign company in occupations such as engineering , finance and accounting			0
the truth is that the testing culture of @entity25 has taken a big toll			1
corruption such as bribery , cheating and other forms of fraud intended to boost test results has been rampant in the past as well as today			0
stress , anxiety , poor physical health and a lack of social and practical life skills are well - known characteristics of @entity25 students			1
the biggest price @entity25 has paid is the loss of creative talents			0
its education system stifles creativity , suppresses individuality and induces conformity by forcing all children to compete for better test outcomes in a narrow set of subjects			1
testing rewards those who are willing and able to give the right answers in the right way as demanded by the authority , while eliminating those who are unwilling or unable , but who may be talented in other areas			0
it thus fosters the spirit of compliance			2
it also results in impoverished educational experiences by forcing schools and teachers to teach to the test			0
parents , too , are forced to narrow their children 's education experience to improve their children 's test performance			1
children are thus deprived of the opportunities to explore their interests and find their passion			0
@entity25 has become keenly aware of the damages of its test - oriented education			1
over the past few decades , @entity25 has launched multiple rounds of reforms to reduce the importance of testing			2
last year , for example , the @entity149 issued the order to ban testing for grades one through three			0
for grades four and up , standardized testing is only allowed once per term for three subjects ( @entity25 , math and foreign language )			2
tests can not be used to admit students during the compulsory education stage			0
there is no reason to believe @entity23 can be immune to the corruptive power of high stakes testing @entity25 has suffered			1
the increase in standardized testing that resulted from @entity167 has already led to an increase in the number of cheating scandals in schools across the country , narrowing of curricula , and stress on teachers and children			0
thanks to @entity25 's outstanding @entity69 performance , @entity23 has been encouraged to learn from @entity25			1
but the @entity25 lesson that matters most is not what it did to do well on international tests			2
rather , it is the country 's recent reform efforts to de-emphasize testing			0
@entity25 wants to have the same kind of creative and entrepreneurial talents @entity23 desires for the future			2
it is doing so by minimizing testing , because it has learned that testing and standardization do not help with , and more likely hurt , the development of creative and entrepreneurial talents			0
this is the @entity25 lesson that @entity23 can learn .			1

@entity194 : @entity2 's *advocacy* of more tests for students is not a great idea
@entity194 : @entity25 's education system is a test - prep machine , and that 's been problematic
he says a testing culture stifles creativity , fosters spirit of compliance , imposes stress
@entity194 : the lesson for @entity23 is that @entity25 is trying to turn away from a test - oriented education
