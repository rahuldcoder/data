people using @entity1 to search for information about their medical problems may soon get another source of information : a real - time chat with a doctor			1
the search giant has confirmed to tech blog @entity9 that it is testing a system that would offer video chats with doctors to people whose search terms involve medical symptoms			1
@entity1 told the site that the company is paying for the feature while it 's in the testing phase			1
but it 's likely that it would be a paid feature if it is rolled out to the public at large			2
@entity1 did not immediately reply to a message seeking comment for this story			2
doctors are famously frustrated by patients who search for symptoms online			0
while there are quality sites out there , such open - ended searches can convince people they 're sicker than they really are , and more dubious sites can offer sketchy advice about how to treat the symptoms			0
for patients , a paid , online visit with a doctor could still be cheaper , and more convenient than an actual visit			0
in an image on photo site @entity43 , a screen capture presumably from someone testing the feature shows a video link with the words " talk to a doctor now			1
" the feature 's information box reads , " based on your search query , we think you are trying to understand a medical condition			2
here you can find health care providers who you can visit with over video chat			0
all visit costs are covered by @entity1 during this limited trial			0

@entity1 testing doctor video - chat feature
the feature would be available when people search medical terms
it 's free during testing , but would presumably cost if made public
