-- @entity2 's @entity1 and @entity3 of @entity4 were the leaders after the first day of play at the masters in @entity8			1
@entity3 hit six birdies in his opening round to finish six under par with a round of 66 , a benchmark which @entity1 , who had gone out earlier , had already set			1
tipped by many to win his first major since 2008 , @entity14 shot a two - under 70 , which is the same opening score as in three of his four victories at @entity8			1
" it 's a good start , " @entity14 said			0
" some years some guys shot 65 starting out here , but right now i 'm only four back and i 'm right there			0
@entity23 " we 've got a long way to go			0
you just go out there and play shot for shot			0
" in many ways though , the day belonged to 14 - year - old @entity31			1
the @entity33 schoolboy not only set the record as the youngest player to ever compete at the masters , he then followed that up with a round of one - over par. @entity31 , who beat the previous record held by @entity41 's @entity40 , who was nearly 17 when he set the previous mark in 2010 , bogeyed his first but responded swiftly with a birdie at the third			1
he finished with a putt off the green that sunk into the hole at the 18th to earn applause and acclaim from spectators and fellow competitors			0
meanwhile , @entity53 @entity52 also earned himself a place in the @entity8 record books after hitting a hole - in - one at the sixth , only the fifth player in the competition 's 77 - year history to achieve the feat. with a heavy thunderstorm expected overnight that will soften the greens , @entity14 warned " the golf course is going to be very different " on friday			2
elsewhere , three - time masters champion @entity65 carded a one under par 71 , while young @entity67 star @entity66 went round in 72			2
however defending champion @entity68 faces a uphill battle to defend his title after he struggled to a 75 -- leaving him nine strokes off the pace already			0

@entity14 shoots a solid two - under 70 to *mimic* his opening round of previous *successes*
