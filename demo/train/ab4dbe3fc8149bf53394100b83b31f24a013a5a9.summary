-- president @entity1 will answer questions about the economy and jobs wednesday during his first @entity6 town hall meeting			1
but the president , known for his oft - lengthy responses to the shortest of questions , will not be confined to @entity6 's 140 - character limit			1
he is verbally answering questions from @entity6 users , who were urged to use the hashtag # @entity15			1
with the exception of questions coming from @entity6 users -- known as tweeps -- the @entity17 town hall event will be like many the president has done before : fielding select questions conveyed via new media technologies while giving " old - fashioned " answers with a microphone			2
" he 's just answering the questions			0
he 's not typing and tweeting , " @entity29 spokesman @entity28 said last week			1
@entity29 officials have said the so - called " tweetup " is a fresh opportunity for the president to engage with @entity33 beyond the @entity34			0
the event will feature an audience of about 140 individuals who follow the @entity29 @entity6 feed and signed up for a chance to attend			1
the 140 is not a coincidence -- it 's the number of characters allowed in a tweet			0
@entity6 co-founder @entity45 will monitor the expected flood streaming in through the official # @entity49 hashtag			1
" questions addressed during the town hall will be selected both in advance and in real - time during the event , " @entity6 said in a statement			2
@entity1 held a similar town hall at @entity58 headquarters in @entity59 , @entity60 , in april and a @entity62 town hall at the @entity29 in february			2
at both events , the @entity29 was criticized for ignoring the subject that drew by far the most queries : whether he supports legalizing marijuana			0
though the president rarely tweets himself , the administration has increasingly used social media to bypass traditional media outlets and convey information directly to supporters			0
several senior administration officials tweet regularly , including @entity28 .			0

@entity1 will not be confined to @entity6 's 140 - character limit
" he 's just answering the questions . he 's not typing and tweeting , " @entity29 says
@entity6 co-founder @entity45 to monitor the expected flood of tweets
