-- @entity1 moved closer on monday to sealing , once and for all , its ruptured well in the @entity3 , though government and company officials said their struggle against the spill 's extensive environmental and economic damage is far from over			1
a relief well is expected to start the final shutdown within the week , said retired @entity14 adm. @entity13 , the government 's point man in the region			1
@entity13 said the closer of two relief wells alongside the capped , formerly gushing @entity1 well in the @entity3 is 17,909 feet deep and less than 100 feet from intercepting the main well			1
during the previous 72 to 96 hours , he said , crews had twice drilled for 30 feet at a time , then backed out and put wire down the pipe to gauge the exact location relative to the main well			2
@entity13 said drillers would make " one more run , " and hoped to intercept , then pump cement into , the main well as early as the end of the week , permanently sealing the crippled well			1
crews will have to keep a close watch on inclement weather while drilling			2
strong thunderstorms and gusty winds are possible over the main well starting on wednesday , said @entity0 meteorologist @entity31			2
the @entity32 said a broad area of low pressure over southern @entity35 is forecast to move slowly northwestward into the @entity3 and toward the north - central @entity36 this week			2
the system has roughly a 30 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours , the center said			0
also on monday , @entity1 , the oil company that operated the sunken well , released an updated tally on expenses associated with cleanup and containment , which now stands at about $ 6.1 billion			1
@entity1 said it has established a trust and made an initial $ 3 billion deposit of the previously announced $ 20 billion escrow account to pay " legitimate " claims arising from the april 20 @entity50 incident and the resulting oil and gas spill			1
the oil giant named two trustees who will administer the account : @entity56 , a former federal judge for the @entity58 , and @entity59 , dean of the @entity61			0
@entity62 will serve as corporate trustee and paying agent for the account , @entity1 said			1
responding to the company 's $ 3 billion deposit , the @entity66 said monday details of the account have been worked out			1
a top government attorney noted that @entity1 is fulfilling its obligations			1
" we are pleased that @entity1 made an initial contribution and has taken an important step toward honoring its commitment to the president and the residents and business owners in the @entity83 , " associate attorney general @entity73 said in a statement confirming @entity1 's $ 3 billion installment			1
also on monday , @entity1 's newly - appointed chief executive @entity84 met with high - level @entity86 officials and @entity13 to talk about recovery efforts			1
government officials stressed the importance of @entity1 living up to its commitments , including the quick payment of claims made by state and local governments , according to a @entity86 statement			1
president @entity97 , who has been under pressure to show a strong response to the spill , said he was committed to standing by communities along the @entity36 well beyond when the well is closed			1
" what is clear is that the battle to stop the oil flowing from into the @entity3 is just about over			0
our work goes on , though , " he said in @entity106			2
the oil spill has n't just hurt @entity1 's bottom line -- it 's inflicted heavy blows on @entity36 industries like tourism and fishing			1
a group of concerned @entity117 , @entity118 , residents said they left on a caravan of support on monday , spending money at small businesses along the @entity36 , using funds raised from around the country			0
the caravan is expected to travel through @entity126 , @entity127 and the @entity35 panhandle , completing its trek on friday			0
" we 've learned of so many businesses in the @entity83 that are losing their customers , employees and dreams because of the impact on tourism , " organizer @entity130 said in a statement			0
" as a small business owner , i ca n't imagine how i 'd support the people who depend on me			0
we can become tourists with a purpose			0
" the well erupted after an april 20 explosion aboard the drilling rig @entity50 that left 11 men dead			0
a temporary cap contained the spill on july 15 , and nearly 3,000 barrels of heavy drilling mud and cement drove the oil back into the ocean floor last week			2
the well gushed an estimated 53,000 barrels ( 2.3 million gallons ) of oil per day before it was capped , with some of the oil ending up on beaches or in marshes			0
fresh , green grass has begun growing again in some of the hardest - hit marshes of southern @entity163 , but oil continues to wash ashore in places			0
@entity13 said monday responders will be " redoubling " their efforts in the marshes			2
" there 's a lot of clean - up working going on here , and that 's excellent , " @entity168 of the @entity169 , told @entity0 last week			0
" but the tide keeps coming and going each and every day			0
" @entity0 's @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity179 contributed to this report .			0
