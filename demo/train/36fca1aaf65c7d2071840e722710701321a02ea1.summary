-- and on the 61st day , the touchpad rose again			0
@entity2 has plans to produce another round of its @entity1 tablets before the year is out , despite its earlier decision to discontinue its mobile hardware products			1
" despite announcing an end to manufacturing webos hardware , we have decided to produce one last run of @entity14 to meet unfulfilled demand , " @entity2 spokesman @entity8 wrote in a company blog post			1
" as we know more about how , when and where @entity14 will be available , we will communicate that here and through e-mail to those who requested notification			0
" @entity8 says it will be a few weeks before devices from the additional run will be available for purchase			1
the blog post signals further confusion from a company in upheaval			0
two weeks ago , @entity2 announced suddenly it would end production on all of its mobile hardware , including the soon - to - be - released @entity32 smartphones			1
the decision also included the company 's @entity35 competitor , the @entity1 , killed off a mere 49 days after its debut in july			2
circulating rumors suggested third - party retailers were sitting on hundreds of thousands of unsold units			0
@entity2 followed its announcement by slashing prices on remaining touchpad inventory , reducing the price of the 16 - gigabyte @entity1 to $ 100 , and the 32 - gig version to $ 150			1
since the blowout sale prices , however , the company has n't been able to keep any @entity14 in stock			0
retailers have been bombarded by customer requests for the cheapened devices , and dozens of retailers have reported completely selling out			2
which is most likely the reason behind @entity2 's decision to once again beef up its inventory for a last @entity1 blast			1
" tablet computing is a segment of the market that 's relevant , absolutely , " @entity2 personal systems group exec @entity57 told @entity59 in an interview			2
the company continues to explore licensing options for , webos -- its proprietary operating system -- according to @entity57			0
there 's no guarantee , however , that @entity2 will continue to sell the last round of tablets at a $ 100 rate			1
hardware teardown website @entity73 speculates that , in terms of components alone , a 16 - @entity1 costs @entity2 approximately $ 300 to build			1
that 's a $ 200 bath @entity2 is taking on each individual unit sold , not including the cost of labor , shipping and associated expenses			1
@entity2 did not immediately respond to a phone request for comment			2
while the resurgence in @entity1 interest may be a promising sign for @entity2 , the company 's flip - flopping decision process is n't serving its public image			1
" the only thing i know for sure that 's going on at @entity2 is that they have completely lost control of their message , " @entity92 analyst @entity91 said by e-mail to @entity94			2
@entity91 continued , saying @entity2 was " sabotaging their brand with the mixed messages			0
" as of today , the touchpad is now the no. 2 best - selling tablet after the @entity35 , according to @entity107			0
ironically , that 's the exact position @entity2 was vying for			0
unfortunately for the company , it took bargain - bin pricing and the threat of extinction to get there			0
