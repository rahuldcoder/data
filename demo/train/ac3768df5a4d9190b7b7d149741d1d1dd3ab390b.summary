@entity0 -- as a child , @entity2 would spend her summer nights lying on the rooftop of her family 's home in @entity8			1
her father and uncle had told her stories of their childhood , when they would sleep on the same rooftop and hear lions roaring			2
" i used to lay there , listening for those same sounds			0
but i did n't hear anything , " @entity2 said			1
@entity2 's father finally got the courage to tell his young daughter that she would not hear lions roaring because they had long since gone extinct in @entity8			1
" that was the moment when i decided i knew what i wanted to do , " @entity2 said			1
" i wanted to hear lions roaring			1
" @entity2 , now 35 , has since devoted her life to lion conservation			1
while earning her master 's in conservation biology , @entity2 's research led her to @entity0			1
she lived in a tree house and began seeing firsthand the rapid decline of @entity34 lions due to habitat loss and human - lion conflict			1
" sixty years ago , there were probably half a million lions in @entity39			1
today , there are less than 30,000 lions in all of @entity39 , " she said			1
now armed with a doctorate in environmental studies , @entity2 has found one solution to help the lion population grow			1
her nonprofit turns @entity48 warriors -- who have a tradition of killing lions -- into lion protectors			1
the organization employs 65 @entity53 throughout @entity39			1
their ultimate goal : reduce lion killings			2
" the lion is iconic , " said @entity2 , who started @entity53 in 2007			1
" if there are no lions left in @entity39 , it will have a significant effect			1
... we could lose a lot more than just the lion			2
" changing a culture @entity2 spent a year living among the @entity48 to understand their relationship with lions and why they were killing them			1
for one , young warriors receive their lion name when they first kill a lion , a sort of rite of passage			1
" it brings a huge amount of prestige to the warrior who kills a lion , " @entity2 said			1
the @entity48 also live a mostly pastoral life and depend on their livestock			2
they use it to feed their families ; they use it for currency			0
livestock is also a status symbol			0
" livestock are the core of their culture			0
... it 's their main source of livelihood , " @entity2 said			2
" when they lose their cows , they do n't have anything left			0
so they retaliate , and they kill lions			2
" @entity2 's idea for @entity53 came together while living in the community and spending time with the warriors			1
" they started opening up and telling me stories , " she said			0
" that 's when it clicked			0
" @entity2 realized that @entity48 warriors , the leaders and protectors in their community , would be the best ambassadors for lions			1
she began teaching them the benefits of protecting lions , with an emphasis on preserving their culture			2
in turn , the lessons began rippling through the entire tribe			0
" @entity48 have a very close - knit relationship with lions			0
it 's very much a love - and - hate relationship , " @entity2 said			2
" they dislike them because they eat their livestock , but they also admire them tremendously because they are just beautiful animals			0
" from hunter to guardian today , protecting lions is a full - time job for a guardian , who earns around $ 100 a month			0
the group teaches the guardians a number of methods to reduce human - lion conflict in their communities			0
if a guardian hears about a lion hunt , he intervenes			0
he helps the individuals understand the importance of keeping lions alive , including that lions draw tourists to the area , which provides jobs			0
guardians also help farmers strengthen corrals where they keep their livestock			0
they also help find and safely return lost livestock			0
these measures have prevented livestock deaths and , more importantly , retaliatory lion killings			0
" becoming a @entity160 is a rebirth for ( the @entity162 )			0
they gain even more prestige than they would have from killing a lion , " @entity2 said			1
most @entity48 warriors come to @entity53 illiterate , having never attended school			0
@entity2 and her team teach each one how to read and write			2
the guardians also learn about " their " lions ; they keep data on the lions ' movements and population changes as part of their job			0
director of science and co-founder @entity180 works with the guardians to study and name their lions and provides the technical field training and equipment the guardians need to monitor the lions			0
for @entity2 , watching the transformation of young @entity48 warriors has been one of the most rewarding parts of her efforts			1
" we never imagined when we first started @entity53 that we could transform these killers to the point where they would risk their own lives to stop other people from killing lions , " she said			1
@entity2 said the @entity160 program has had great success in the @entity200 region of @entity0			2
when used alone or with other conservation programs , the program was 99 % effective in stopping lion killings			2
" i know we 're making a difference , " @entity2 said			2
" when i first moved here , i never heard lions roaring			0
but now i hear lions roaring all the time			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity53 website at @entity208 and see how to help .			0

@entity2 wanted to help when she learned lions in @entity8 were extinct
she has since devoted her life to lion conservation in @entity39
her nonprofit turns warriors who have a tradition of killing lions into lion protectors
