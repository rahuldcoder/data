-- @entity1 is a three - time olympic gold medalist in track and field			1
but when she was in college , a diagnosis of @entity6 ' disease , an immune system disorder that results in the overproduction of thyroid hormones , posed one of her biggest hurdles			1
@entity0 : you were diagnosed with @entity6 ' disease in 1990			1
what happened leading up to your diagnosis ? @entity1 : i was in college at @entity19			1
things were going very well ; i had set an @entity22 record			1
then , all of sudden , within a month , in my recollection , things started to fall apart			1
my hair started falling out , and at that time , i had long hair			1
it was curly and doing its thing , and it started falling out			1
i had always had long nails unless i cut them ; they started breaking			1
i could n't figure out what was going on			1
the weirdest part for me was losing weight			1
my normal running weight at that time was between 119 and 120 ( pounds )			1
... at my worst -- and i say at my worst because i stopped getting on the scale because i just could n't stand the way i looked -- at my worst , i was under like 85 pounds			2
then it was like , " there is definitely something wrong			2
" i had made the 1988 @entity42 team , and then the bottom fell out , is what i say			1
i could n't run anywhere close to where i had ran just two months prior to that , so definitely there is a problem			2
when i got to the race in the 100 - meter hurdles , i ran slower than the first time i ever ran when i ever stepped on the track			2
... there were no answers for almost 2Â½ years , and it was n't until 1990 ( that i was diagnosed )			1
i had even stopped going out of the house because i could n't stand the way i looked			2
my face was breaking out ; it had white or light spots all over			2
i had little to no hair , and nobody could tell me what was wrong			2
i love kids and remember being at an event outside a little park , and a little kid walked by with their mom and said , " @entity68 , what 's wrong with her ? " that was the last time			2
i actually had covered up mirrors in my house because i did n't want to see myself			2
it was n't a good time			2
@entity0 : what inspired you to make it through being sick and return to running ? @entity1 : although i got sidelined for three years , i figured ... i am going to figure this out go back out there			1
i still have that love and support from my coach and my family			0
... ( @entity82 ) 1992 , at the @entity42 ... back then the heat of the race was lane 4 , 5 and 6 , so that lets you know what ( was ) thought about me in lane 2			1
i tell people , probably three people in the world thought i could do it			0
it 's not what other people believe you can do ; it 's what you believe you can do			0
i honestly believe that everything that happened to me happened for a reason			0
i was supposed to go out and win			0
i felt i had a great start			0
i do n't remember the middle			0
i remember getting to the end			0
... in my race , there 's 10 hurdles , but in life , there is always a hurdle			0
there is always something you got ta get over , and it 's what you do , you know			0
sometimes we fall , sometimes we stumble , but we ca n't stay down			0
we ca n't allow life to beat us down			0
everything happens for a reason , and it builds character in us , and it tells us what we are about and how strong we really are when we did n't think we could be that strong			0
you have to get up			0
you have to keep going			0
you have to try harder , and if somebody else falls down , you have to pick them up and carry them with you			0
... life ( is about ) service and what can i do to help that next person who is struggling ? what is it that happened to me in my life that i can share with somebody else , just to help them make it through ? i am very thankful that i have lived the life i have lived			1
i am thankful for my @entity6 ' disease , and i tell people , if i had my whole life to live over , i would have it , because it has really made me into the person that i am			1
i feel like i am stronger			0
there is nothing i do n't feel like i can do if i try			0
... i take medication every day for the rest of my life , and i just feel like it 's a small price to pay to have my life .			0
