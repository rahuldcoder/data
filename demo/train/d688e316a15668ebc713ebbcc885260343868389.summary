-- this week @entity1 staged another phony protest			1
political parties forced shops to shutter nationwide to object to a government policy allowing international retail giants greater participation in the world 's second most populous country			1
they were outraged on behalf of small shopkeepers			0
@entity1 shopkeepers protest government plan for retail however , for many mom - and - pop shops run in pokey back alleys and on street corners it was a case of " more business than usual			1
" @entity1 's small neighbourhood stores beavered away as always -- delivering much needed groceries home for free - even as the rest of the nation put up a brave fight anticipating the demise of these shops			1
@entity1 's army of small - retailers , it seems , sensed no such threat			1
the shopping culture they share with millions of @entity1 shoppers is a hard one for big retailers to replicate			1
most of the country 's small shops start life as rough makeshift spaces that grow into permanent outposts keeping pace with the demands of the community			2
they mushroom everywhere - in pockets rich and poor , urban and rural , uptown and downtown - stocking goods entirely to reflect the needs of the community they serve			0
the locals , who shop in equal measure for gossip and goods , often drop by for small purchases that can be as obscure as a bar of soap or a box of matchsticks			0
the friendly neighbourhood storekeeper , for those unwilling to bear the trip or the gossip , will also readily deliver such small purchases home , at no extra fee , as many times a day as he is called upon to -- perhaps the biggest reason why @entity1 households remember their grocery needs only from one day to another			2
for a majority of small shopkeepers , no order is too small and no house too far			0
in @entity1 , consumers who shop at these stores are n't looking for the usual supermarket experience			1
customers flocking to corner - shops typically buy goods they need for a limited period and for a limited value			2
groceries are felt , smelt and recommended before any actual purchase is made			0
it 's among few markets in the world where most groceries are still available unlabeled and un-packaged and can be bought in any quantity , however small or large			0
oftentimes , goods are bought on credit with the only one collateral -- trust			0
and many a time , goods are returned -- without any proof of a bill			0
try that at @entity94 or @entity95			0
the biggest challenge for big retail , hoping to dent the business of small shopkeepers though , is familiarity			1
not only do most small shopkeepers know their customers by name , they can also be relied upon for remembering individual grocery - buying patterns ; brand by brand , category by category			2
it 's a given that , even during the busiest periods , the local shopkeeper will remind the customer of things they have n't bought in a while			0
in short , the one - man retailer uses grocery records stored in his memory , far more interactively that a smart phone or the supermarket till ever will			0
to the neighborhood shopper then , the small shopkeeper is an extension of their household			0
to be fair , the entry of organized retail in the last few years has led to a different shopping experience for @entity1 's middle class			1
it 's opened up an aspirational type of shopping , in sanitized environments with well - stocked shelves and everything from clothes to candy under one roof			2
still , according to various industry estimates , such retail accounts for only some 7 percent of @entity1 's $ 450 billion retail market			1
so far , no large @entity1 supermarket chain has managed to replicate the convenience - store format successfully , because it 's tough to offer goods on credit , personalize the service and stay profitable			1
small retailers , who employ workers from the unorganized labour force , are estimated to extract three times the productivity of a uniformed employee at a supermarket			0
it 's even tougher for big - ticket retailers to squeeze margins on small quantities of goods to serve the whimsical needs of each neighborhood			2
it 's then hard to imagine how the world 's biggest retailers will wipe out the small mom - and - pop stores , which work to an organized chaos that few inventory - keeping systems can mimic			1
@entity1 's small - retailers , unlike its deluded political class , realize that there is room for everyone			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity175 .			0

it was " more business than usual " for @entity1 's shopkeepers this week , says @entity175
this was despite political parties forcing some shops to close in protest at retail *reforms*
the government plans to allow international supermarkets greater access to @entity1
but @entity175 says it is hard to imagine big retailers wiping out " mom - and - pop " stores
