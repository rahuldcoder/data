@entity0 -- latino immigrants living in @entity5 , @entity0 , have been living in an environment of intolerance and attacks against them , a report released wednesday by the @entity3 said			1
the atmosphere of intolerance is stoked in part by anti-immigrant groups , an indifferent police department , and county leaders themselves , according to the report			2
the law center , which researches and keeps tabs on hate groups , became interested in the @entity22 county after the november 8 , 2008 , murder of @entity24 , an @entity25 immigrant in @entity26 , @entity0			1
prosecutors allege that the killers were a group of teenagers who targeted @entity31 as part of a sport they called " beaner - hopping			2
" after four months of research in @entity5 that included interviews with more than 70 @entity40 immigrants , 30 local religious leaders and other community leaders , the law center said it found a pattern of ethnic intolerance going back 10 years			1
low - level harassment of @entity31 in @entity5 is common , the report said			2
" they are regularly taunted , spit upon and pelted with apples , full soda cans , beer bottles and other projectiles , " the report said			1
latino residents riding bikes have been run off the road and others have been beaten with baseball bats or shot at with bb guns , the report said			2
" our feeling is that what we found is really the tip of a very ugly iceberg , " @entity60 , who edited the report , said at a news conference wednesday			1
" we were told stories that are absolutely hair - raising			0
" the findings point to a disturbing larger trend , the report said			0
the situation in @entity5 " is a microcosm of a problem facing the entire @entity75 , where @entity77 statistics suggest a 40 percent rise in @entity80 hate crimes between 2003 and 2007 , " the report said			0
tuesday night in @entity26 , the same city where @entity83 was killed , a church frequented by @entity31 was vandalized with anti-mexican graffiti , @entity60 said			0
the climate of fear in @entity5 was created in part by anti-immigration voices that found sympathetic ears in the area , according to the report			2
anti-immigrant groups , such as the now - defunct @entity98 , " heavily influenced the tone for public discourse on immigration in the area , " the report said			0
this stance was adopted by county leaders themselves , the law center said			1
in august 2001 , county legislator @entity103 said that if his community were " attacked " by @entity40 day laborers , " we 'll be up in arms ; we 'll be out with baseball bats			0
" in march 2007 , another county legislator , @entity109 , said of @entity40 day laborers looking for work , " if i 'm living in a neighborhood and people are gathering like that , i would load my gun and start shooting , period			0
" both men later apologized for their remarks , according to news reports			0
@entity5 executive @entity119 , who was also criticized in the report for employing measures seen as anti-immigrant , responded to the report wednesday with a list of facts he says were distorted or taken out of context by the law center			1
for instance , a statement in the report that raids evicted day laborers from their homes in @entity5 was distorted , @entity119 's office said			0
the action in question affected a condemned house where 60 people were living in hazardous conditions , the statement said			0
the law center 's contention that @entity119 tried to downplay the significance of the @entity83 murder was a misrepresentation of a comment the executive made to a reporter , the statement said			1
the law center report also said @entity31 who had suffered harassment and crimes against them seldom reported them to police because they seemed indifferent			1
" many said police did not take their reports of attacks seriously , often blaming the victim instead , " the report said			0
the law center recommended that police receive training to take hate - motivated crimes more seriously , and that area leaders avoid language that could be conducive to inciting violence against immigrants .			1
