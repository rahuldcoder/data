president @entity2 's decision to target militants from @entity4 -- which is now calling itself the " @entity5 " or " is " -- operating in @entity0 comes as a huge relief to the @entity7			1
officials in @entity9 have been panic stricken since @entity4 forces overran the northern @entity0 city of @entity13 on june 10			1
all political factions in @entity9 would like to see isis suffer and its latest advances rolled back			2
at the same time , contradictory statements made in @entity9 make it clear that the @entity7 authorities are divided about the implications of the @entity22 military 's return to @entity0			1
the moderates , the group of people associated with president @entity26 's presidential administration , are nudging toward an open admission that @entity22 military operations in @entity0 compliment @entity9 's policy goals			1
the hawks in @entity9 , however , remain reluctant to publicly admit to any shared interests with @entity33			1
still , overall , @entity34 and the @entity22 are clearly going in the same direction in @entity0 , at least while the fight against @entity4 rages on			1
at first , there was nothing but silence in @entity9 as @entity22 f - 18s on friday began to target @entity4 militants			1
the silence was more than revealing			0
in the corridors of power in @entity9 , where no opportunity is missed to condemn @entity22 foreign policy at every turn , the silence was tantamount to a roaring approval of @entity33 's intervention			1
on monday , the moderate faction of president @entity26 took a step to formally spell out its backing for @entity22 airstrikes			2
not only was @entity9 approving but is evidently looking to expand the campaign against " is " and began touting a joint @entity7 - @entity22 effort in doing so			1
@entity58 , a deputy to @entity34 's foreign minister @entity59 , told an @entity7 newspaper " @entity7 - @entity22 cooperation against [ @entity62 ] is possible and achievable			1
" this was the first time since the @entity22			0
airstrikes began that a senior @entity7 official has spoken in such terms			0
it is easy to dismiss @entity58 as bureaucrat whose words carry little weight in @entity9			0
but his statement was clearly carefully formulated and was hardly a fluke			0
and given his stature inside the @entity7 system his words must be seen as a peek into the internal policy debate in @entity9 about the situation in @entity0 and @entity34 's options			1
some kind of -- at least tacit -- cooperation with @entity33 is one of those options being studied			0
politically , it is already happening			0
@entity9 and @entity33 do n't just agree on the need for airstrikes against @entity4			1
they are also in agreement that @entity0 above all needs a new political leadership and that prime minister @entity90 has to go			2
since monday 's developments in @entity93 and the nomination of a new premier by @entity0 's president @entity96 , @entity34 's reaction has been one of approval of the turn of events			1
@entity90 's fate today , @entity102 , the head of @entity34 's @entity103 , gave his unequivocal approval for a new prime minister to take over in @entity93			2
no more @entity7 dithering on the fate of @entity90 it seems			0
the fact is that @entity102 was himself heavily involved in recent weeks to seek out an alternative to @entity90 , including a trip he made to @entity0 in late july to consult with various @entity0 political circles			2
the @entity22 were quicker to recognize @entity90 to be at the heart of @entity0 's malaise but the @entity7 have finally come around to the same conclusion			1
and this matters a lot given @entity9 's immense leverage within @entity0 's @entity119 but also @entity121 political factions			1
for @entity34 , the fight against the extremists from the @entity5 is a critical threat			0
@entity9 desperately wants to keep @entity0 intact as a nation state			2
it is particularly adamantly opposed to @entity0 @entity126 seceding as @entity0 @entity121 have been threatening to do			0
and in this equation , @entity90 had become an unbearable burden for @entity7 policy			0
the @entity121 leadership that @entity9 is so hard trying to cultivate and steer away from an independence bid want @entity90 gone			2
and @entity90 's woeful management of the @entity0 military 's response to the newly declared " @entity5 " made the @entity7 just wonder what he was good for			0
there are reports the @entity7 military is engaged in supporting @entity140 forces against @entity4 militants			0
if true , this goes to show the depth of @entity7 anxieties about the " @entity5 's " rise in @entity0			0
who 's in driver 's seat ? as far as the @entity22 role in combating the @entity5 is concerned , the @entity7 debate is likely to remain split between the moderates and the hawks			1
the moderates like to focus on the practical challenge at hand in @entity0 and ways that @entity9 and @entity33 can collaborate			1
they are comfortable with limited tactical cooperation if that is all that can come out of it			0
and , they readily admit that the neutralization of @entity4 needs an @entity22 military involvement			2
the hawks , immersed in a historic cloak of hostility to the @entity22 , can not yet bear to admit to this reality even if they can not fail to see its inevitability			0
but all the recent trends suggest that the moderate viewpoint in @entity9 has the upper hand on the policy question of @entity0 and how @entity34 can best serve its interests			1
and president @entity26 seems eager these days to battle it out with his hawkish critics			0
on the question of the need for @entity34 to negotiate and cooperate with the @entity22 on its nuclear program , he told his detractors this week to go " to hell			2
" @entity182 will show if @entity26 and his moderate wing can continue to sit in the driver 's seat on the question of @entity0 .			0

@entity188 writes that @entity9 is relieved by the @entity22 decision to strike @entity4
political hawks in @entity34 are *avoiding* admitting shared goals with the @entity22 , he says
but @entity188 says both agree on the need for airstrikes and new leadership in @entity0
recent trends suggest that @entity9 's moderates have the upper hand , he suggests
