@entity0 , @entity1 -- who are the greatest feminist film characters ? @entity5 ? @entity6 ? catwoman ? what about an astrophysicist ? if it was up to @entity14 - winning actor @entity13 , our feminine heroines would n't be limited to ass - kicking wonder women			1
they could even be -- wait for it -- nerdy scientists			2
the 32 - year - old star of @entity22 blockbuster " thor : @entity30 , " hopes her role as astrophysicist love interest @entity24 will encourage a new generation of young women to enter the sciences -- much like " @entity28 ' " princess @entity29 is believed to have done over three decades ago			1
watch : @entity31 and @entity13 make science cool " it 's really cool that @entity31 -- the comic company behind the @entity20 series -- is working on what they call @entity38 : science , technology , engineering and math , " @entity13 told @entity2 in an interview in @entity0 , ahead of the premiere this week			1
" women are underrepresented in those fields so they are trying to encourage girls to study them more , because obviously there 's no reason why they should n't be			0
" " and that 's really exciting because that 's exactly what you want with these kinds of movies			0
they 're big and they 're fun and if you can have a little bit of impact on a young girl seeing them and saying ' wait , that 's possible too , ' then that would be really cool			0
" while the original " @entity20 " comic book portrayed the superhero 's sweetheart , @entity24 , as a nurse , the character has been reinvented as a scientist for the big screen			1
could @entity13 become the new role model for female scientists , much like @entity73 as astrophysicist @entity74 in 1997 film " contact " , or @entity77 as zoologist @entity78 in 1988 drama " @entity79 " , or even sci - fi hero @entity81 as princess @entity29 in the " @entity28 " series ? she certainly hopes so			1
for @entity13 , feminist characters are n't necessarily the ones who keep up with the boys -- they come in all shapes and sizes			2
" the fallacy in @entity22 is that if you 're making a ' feminist ' story , the woman kicks ass and wins , " she told @entity89 in the magazine 's november 2013 issue			0
" that 's not feminist , that 's macho			0
a movie about a weak , vulnerable woman can be feminist if it shows a real person that we can empathize with			0
" featuring @entity105 actor @entity104 as @entity20 , the crown prince of @entity106 , the second installment of the film tells the story of an otherworldly superhero who has been exiled from his homeland to @entity112			2
" at the beginning of @entity114 , @entity24 is really focused on her scientific inquiries			0
@entity20 has been missing in action for a couple years , has n't called , has n't written , " explains @entity13			1
" she 's seen him on tv in @entity118 and he has n't made contact so she 's pretty angry at him			0
but she 's just trying to move on with her life and that 's where we find her , " added the mother - of - one , who reportedly watched " @entity126 " , to prepare for the role			1
@entity128 feeling born in @entity134 , the only child of her @entity131 film agent mother and @entity133 fertility specialist father , @entity13 moved to the @entity131 at three years old , eventually settling in @entity118			1
as a youngster she attended theater camp and entered science fairs , until at age 11 she scored her big break as a gun - toting orphan in @entity1 - speaking @entity128 film " @entity142 : the professional "			1
decades before @entity144 appeared as a 13 - year - old hitgirl in 2010 action film " @entity147 " , @entity13 was targeting her own bad guys in the 1994 thriller which launched her career			1
almost 20 years later , @entity13 , who won an @entity14 in 2011 for her portrayal of a disturbed ballerina in @entity154 film " @entity155 " , may again be returning to @entity128 cinema			1
it was on the " @entity155 " set that she undertook a year of training with future husband , @entity128 dancer and choreographer @entity161			2
the pair now have a two - year - old son , @entity163			0
" well i hope i 'll be able to work in @entity128 cinema , that will depend on what people will hire me for , " said the actor who speaks @entity128 , @entity164 , and @entity166			1
" i think i 'd probably need to work on my @entity128 a little , but i 'd be happy to try			2
a little @entity172 kind of accented @entity128 , " she added , referring to the 1960s @entity131 - born screen siren			1
women in cinema @entity13 , who in 2008 served as the youngest member of the 61st @entity177 jury , added that she would like to see more female filmmakers and pointed to directors @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity182 as inspirations			1
" you still really see that the majority of @entity131 filmmakers and writers are predominantly male			2
which is great , i want men to keep making movies , but i 'd love for there to be more female voices as well			0
and of course it influences the kind of material you read because the stories that a male perspective has , the way women figure into it , is very different , " she said			0
" you get a lot of girlfriends and muses and shrews			0
and every once in a while there 's a magic moment where there 's a really interesting perspective			0
my hope would be that they widen the access to women , and women are more inspired and encouraged to take on those kinds of roles			0
" @entity13 , who has a degree in psychology from @entity217 , also pointed to the defined gender roles on set : " you do n't see female directors of photography , you do n't see female technical crew members			1
usually they 're more on the hair and makeup , and wardrobe side			0
" and it 's more common to have all of the grips and gaffers and electric and camera , to be entirely male , which is just interesting			0
" if @entity13 has her way though , there wo n't just be more females on film sets -- but in science laboratories as well .			2

@entity13 says new role in ' @entity20 : @entity30 ' could encourage female scientists
@entity14 winner and mother - of - one may turn to @entity128 cinema
@entity133 - born @entity131 wants more female directors , *fan* of @entity181 , @entity182
