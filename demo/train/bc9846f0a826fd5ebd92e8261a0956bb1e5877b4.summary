-- last month , thousands of people in @entity2 opened up their newspapers to find a full - page picture of a woman with a black eye clearly visible underneath her burqa			1
below the image ran the slogan in @entity10 , " some things ca n't be covered " , and a list of phone numbers for local domestic abuse shelters			1
in a culture that tends to turn a blind eye to the issue of violence towards women , it was a shocking and powerful image			1
" it 's a problem that 's been swept under the carpet for years , " says @entity21 , the creative director for @entity22 , the @entity23 - based agency responsible for the advert			0
when @entity28 approached the @entity29 , a charity that focuses on issues of advocacy and developing the country 's non-profit sector , they were n't sure what type of reaction to expect			1
" i think that there was always a real concern that , given the subject matter , it would never get through , " says @entity21			0
a major push came from @entity2 princess hrh @entity41 , the foundation 's director			1
though the campaign has captured the public 's attention , both within @entity2 and abroad , where an @entity47 version has made the rounds online , @entity49 says she does n't see the ad as shocking			1
" my media and pr team were a bit nervous going into this , saying , ' are you sure you want to do this ? ' " she admits			0
" i did n't understand why			0
i do n't understand what is so controversial			0
who will say , ' yes , it 's ok for women to be beaten up ' ? " read more : women directors find acclaim worldwide @entity2 women are legally reliant on the permission of their male guardians to travel freely , driving is still a socially contentious issue and there are no laws that protect victims of domestic abuse			1
according to @entity49 , however , change is in the air			0
" for several years , domestic abuse was sort of the elephant in the room			1
there was nowhere for a woman to go if she was abused because a system was n't set up to handle that , " she admits			0
though the issue is still not completely out in the open , she notes the last few years has seen a rise in shelters that cater to female victims of violence			2
it has been a watershed year for women 's rights in the conservative country			1
so far , women have been accepted into the government 's advisory @entity92 , given the right to vote , gained entry into a range of new professions ( including engineering and law ) and granted permission to have their own ids without guardian permission			1
@entity104 , a @entity105 researcher at @entity106 , admits that though these measures are impressive , more needs to be done to protect women inside the country			2
" there are no laws that protect women specifically			1
if , for example , a woman claims rape , and a man says it was consensual , she can face a counter charge of adultery , " he says			0
though there is currently no law that punishes a man for beating his wife , the @entity29 has prepared legislation that would do just that			1
in fact , it is the pending bill , which would decide the punitive measures abusers could face ( a mix of imprisonment , financial restitution and loss of custody ) , that spurred the campaign to begin with			2
last year , the @entity92 pushed through similar legislation the foundation helped pen protecting the rights of children in abusive situations			1
@entity49 is confident that the drafted legislation will meet with the same level of success			2

" women who speak out about emotional abuse or neglect often face societal judgments			2
there is a prevalent attitude that if a man hits his wife , it 's acceptable , because she 's not being a good wife			0
" @entity104 points to a ten year old study in the @entity157 where @entity2 men were polled on whether they ever hit their wives -- 53 % answered yes			1
@entity49 agrees that the @entity2 mindset has to change and notes that a major obstacle is the naturally guarded nature of the culture			2
" this is a very private society , and we tend to try to deal with things discreetly			0
we do not air our dirty laundry in public , as families or as communities , " she says			0
" the negative side of that discretion is that it allows abusive behavior to thrive , because it is not stopped			0
" a main goal of the campaign is to create a countrywide social dialogue			2
in that regard , says @entity21 , the campaign has been successful			0
" outside of the two days of ads we ran , it 's been printed on the front page of national newspapers , " he says			0
" people are talking about it , and it 's been largely well - received			0

@entity2 has launched its first *anti-domestic* abuse ad campaign
domestic abuse is not currently *criminalized* in @entity2 , and there are no laws protecting women from violence
the @entity29 has timed the campaign to push an *anti-abuse* law it drafted last year
