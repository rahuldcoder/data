-- @entity1 will forever be remembered as the first gymnast to achieve the perfect score of 10 in @entity5 competition on the way to winning three gold medals at the 1976 @entity8			1
@entity1 , who was just 14 , went into the @entity5 with admittedly " very , very low expectations " -- but in the space of a few short days became one of the most recognizable athletes on the planet			1
competing for @entity14 , she was awarded seven scores of 10 during the course of the competition as she took gold in the uneven bars , beam and all - round disciplines , backed up by a silver in the team event and bronze on the floor			1
" it 's hard to believe it 's 36 years since i did that , it does n't feel that long , but it is			0
i remember everything , all the routines , " she said in an interview for @entity0 's @entity32 series			0
coached by the famous combination of @entity36 and @entity37 , who trained many gymnastics champions , @entity1 went on to claim two more gold medals at the @entity40 in @entity41 and captured two world championship golds and nine at european championship level			1
she retired from competition in 1981 and turned to coaching , but in 1989 , shortly before the revolution which other threw @entity14 president @entity48 , @entity1 defected to the @entity49			1
in 1994 she became engaged to @entity49 gymnast @entity50 , who had first met her back in 1976			1
they married in 1996 in @entity52 as she returned to her native country for the first time since defecting			0
@entity1 became a @entity49 citizen in 2001 and is still involved in gymnastics through an academy she runs with @entity50 , while holding a number of honorary positions with the @entity14 and international federations			1
early years spotted by the @entity61 at the age of six , @entity1 started training at their academy in her hometown of @entity66			1
" i did n't know i wanted to be a gymnast , i was just introduced to the gym , " she said			2
" i loved the place because it looked like a hi - tech playground with mats and a lot of things i can hang from			0
" but i like the competition			0
and probably if i did n't do gymnastics i would have done a different sport and hopefully i would have been good enough			0
" that competitive edge helped her burst onto the international scene with four golds at the @entity82 championships in @entity83 in 1975 , and the following year came @entity5 immortality			1
inspirations in a golden era for women 's gymnastics , the 1972 olympics in @entity87 featured two competitors who were a big influence on @entity1 as she watched at home in @entity14			1
she admired the graceful @entity94 , who won the all - round gold title , but it was another @entity98 entrant , the diminutive @entity99 , who captured her imagination -- and that of the international audience -- in winning three gold medals			2
" @entity99 was the famous gymnast in that time , but i was watching her in the gymnastics and i said to myself , ' i hope one day i will be like her , ' " said @entity1			1
four years later they competed against each other in @entity107 , with @entity99 winning gold as part of a @entity111 team which relegated @entity14 to silver			1
perfection while @entity1 missed out on that team gold , it was her performances in the individual and all - round disciplines that catapulted the teenager to fame			1
competing in the uneven bars final , @entity1 first achieved perfection , a mark of 10 from the judges			1
but there was an element of farce as she awaited her score			2
" first of all it was not 10 , it was a one point zero zero because the computers could n't cope ! " she recalled			0
" they were not prepared for the 10 , so they did n't make enough space after the decimal to be able to accommodate the 10			0
" they said it was a one point zero zero or a hundred , which meant nothing in gymnastics , or a one is ... a one is a really bad score			0
" after the technical glitch was sorted , @entity1 was able to celebrate with her teammates , but in contrast to the emotional @entity99 , she rarely showed emotion during competition and was the butt of some criticism for her demeanor			1
" i always said that i was the kind of person who did n't smile all the time , but i did smile at the end of the routine , " @entity1 said			2
" i think that when you are on a four - inch balance beam , you do n't care about laughing or smiling or waving to the crowd because you 're going to be down in a second			0
" looking back on her feat , the gymnastics equivalent of the first four - minute mile in athletics , @entity1 almost downplays her achievement			2
" people ask me what the definition of perfection , i said it 's none , there is no definition of perfection			0
at some particular time when i was 14 years old , i 've done something that people did n't expect , " she said			0
" it 's a ladder that you climb in life , and i got there first			0
" philosophy @entity1 is aware that , like @entity99 before her , she inspired a generation of gymnasts , but she believes they should stamp their own mark on their career			2
" i do n't think you should replicate what i 've done , everybody has to be unique and do their own thing , " @entity1 said			2
" i think that the kids should have role models , but i do n't think you should duplicate anybody			0
you should create your own thing			0
" @entity1 spent many hours of training from an early age to win her gold medals , and says that is still the recipe for success			2
" you have to have a lot of passion for what you do , to be able to work hard and to have a lot of motivation because you 're going to go to places that you 're never going to believe			0
