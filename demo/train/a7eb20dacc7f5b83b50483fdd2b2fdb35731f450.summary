-- @entity1 is rolling out a fresh design for its central page , the @entity4 , at an event thursday			1
the main column that cuts down the center of the @entity1 home page currently shows a hodgepodge of updates , photos , links and likes from friends , companies , organizations and any other pages you follow			1
the feed is the heart of @entity1 , where many members spend the majority of their time reading , liking and clicking			1
the invitation from @entity1 for thursday 's 1 p.m. et event is vague , simply beckoning , " come see a new look for @entity4			1
" but there have been some clues about what that new look might entail			0
@entity31 at @entity32 reports that the main news feed will be broken into categories , with content such as music information and photos ( including @entity39 shots ) separated off into dedicated feeds			1
in january , ceo @entity41 described the @entity4 as one of the three pillars of @entity1 , along with timeline and the new graph search feature , which is still in beta			1
the largely ad - supported free service likely will update ads and other graphics elements			0
facebook users do n't always take well to change			0
much of the venom is reserved for policy changes , such as confusing updates to privacy settings , but the tweaks to the physical look of the site also generate a lot of feedback			0
when @entity1 rolled out its timeline feature in 2011 , some members balked at the radically different look and even started petitions asking that the new profile pages be made optional			2
in 2008 , the company debuted a major redesign dubbed the " new @entity1 , " and in 2009 overhauled users ' homepages			2
people were vocal about their issues with those updates , but eventually things quieted down and @entity1 went on its merry way , eventually growing its worldwide user base to more than 1 billion profiles			0
we 'll report live on the updates from @entity1 headquarters thursday			2
until then , we 'd love to hear what you 'd like to see changed in your @entity4 , or what beloved features you do n't want touched			0
here are a few suggestions from @ @entity85 's @entity84 followers : .			0
