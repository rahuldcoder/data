@entity0 -- fashion models have often been accused of being beautiful , but plastic			1
on one block in the heart of @entity6 , they really are			0
a stretch of @entity8 has been transformed into a " @entity9 " -- 32 life - sized synthetic models on pedestals seeming to strut their stuff through @entity0 's fashion district			1
from @entity14 to @entity15 , the latest trends and brand image from 32 designers are on display			1
" what makes this experience really fantastic is all these fashions are really meant to make a statement about why this area is so important , why this area has to be zoned and [ to ] keep it for fashion , " @entity20 , a professor of fashion at @entity22 , said			1
historically , @entity0 fashion designers manufactured and produced their product in the city			1
in recent years , @entity20 said about 90 percent of fashion goods production has been shipped overseas , where labor and materials are less expensive to mass produce			0
" i think it 's key to all of this , is how to inspire the youth ? how do we protect an industry where they can come and buy fabric , buy trim , buy threads , find a factory to make it all ? " said the fashion professor			1
the show was created by the @entity52 , and is aimed at showing tourists and @entity0 the historical and artistic representation of the industry			1
" it 's just beautiful to see , to walk down @entity8 and see all these things , " said @entity56 , who works near the display			2
" i hope to see a lot more of these beautiful things in the future			0
" " the way the designers present themselves to the consumer is in retail -- we wanted to give them a way to present themselves creatively as artists , " said @entity63 , executive director of the @entity52			0
" giving them a public place for art is a way to do that , rather than presenting themselves commercially			0
" designers protected the dummies from the elements by wrapping the mannequins in materials			0
they face extreme heat in the summer in the city and prodding and poking tourists , though on one weekday morning , the models stood quietly while tourists and locals sat reading and eating nearby			1
to build the models , designers used metals , sequins , glass , paint , hemp and stone -- and in the case of designer @entity98 , brick and cement to enclose a mannequin with a wall			2
" the mannequins are so different from each other , there 's no main theme at all , and the people are just as diverse as the mannequins , " @entity103 said			2
designs ranged from @entity112 's mannequin , draped in tailored parts of a real parachute , to @entity116 's mannequin covered in leopard print and the personally painted insignia " love is life , " to @entity120 's streetwalking pink and platinum doll drawn in black and covered in sunflowers			0
@entity14 recreated the @entity126 flag much as @entity127 recreated the national anthem at @entity129 in ' 69 , with a mannequin walking through a torn waving plastic @entity126 flag			0
similar to @entity134 's street angels , and @entity0 's former cows and bulls statues , the mannequins are being auctioned off to private donors			1
these mannequins have been posted on @entity138 , with starting bids of $ 500 -- all proceeds will go toward the material for the @entity143 organization -- the biggest contributor of materials to public schools and charities in @entity0			2
@entity103 said she has received offers from one individual donor who may purchase a series of mannequins , and put them on private display in another city			0
the unique fashion show runs until september 3 , on @entity8 between @entity158 and @entity159			2
