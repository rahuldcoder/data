-- @entity2 professor @entity1 began her first day back in the classroom this semester the same way she has since her teaching career began : making sure her research was up to date , her notes reviewed , and the lecture she was about to give was ready			1
but before she left for school , she noticed her infant daughter was n't feeling well			0
since her usual daycare center does n't allow children with fevers , @entity11 decided to bring her baby to class			2
what started as a challenging day for the single working mother soon exploded into a national controversy because after her daughter started fussing , the professor began nursing -- in front of 40 students -- to get her to stop			2
the campus newspaper quickly heard about it and a student reporter from the @entity27 asked the professor for a comment			1
@entity11 , angered that her actions were seen as provocative , fired back -- hard -- on the website @entity33 , saying she was " annoyed that this would be considered newsworthy " and that she " had no intention of making a political statement or shocking students			2
i merely had a sick baby who i could n't leave at daycare on the first day of class			0
... as it turned out , the baby got hungry , so i had to feed it during lecture			0
" her remarks ignited a small protest on campus in @entity11 's favor and against the student newspaper			1
@entity11 's comments , which went viral , also forced the @entity27 to defend its reporting			1
meanwhile , some criticized @entity11 's response to the student journalist and the tone of her rebuttal			1
today professor @entity11 spoke with @entity0 : " frankly i felt , and i continue to feel , that the most professional thing i could do was to carry out the class with as few as possible interruptions			1
leaving class for 10 minutes would have been a serious interruption for my students			0
and i also feel that since i 've been breastfeeding inp public in every place possible -- in buses , on planes -- i did n't realize the degree to which people are afraid of breasts in this country and in particular , in the workplace			2
" @entity2 , which today acknowledged it does not offer any emergency backup child care for its faculty or staff , says this controversy has given rise to a much - needed internal debate			1
" we want our faculty to be the best teachers and scholars possible and , at the same time , we are sympathetic to the need for work - life balance			0
now that this important question has been raised , we consider it healthy to discuss it and we are indeed addressing it in our community , " said @entity87 , senior vice provost and dean of @entity89			0
latch on @entity96 : in support of breastfeeding missing in all this finger - wagging is a discussion about access to emergency backup child care for working parents			1
is there enough , and if not , should employers of all stripes -- public , private , big , small -- be compelled to offer more ? and if it 's the child who is sick , and not the babysitter , what provisions do these centers reasonably need to provide ? according to the latest families and @entity113 , only 6 % of companies surveyed in 2005 offered backup child care			1
this year , the number has dropped to 3 %			0
@entity117 , a leader in the field of backup care , serves the emergency needs of more than 750 companies and even provides services when a child runs a fever			2
last year , a representative of the company said , it provided backup care to infants , toddlers , preschoolers , school - aged children , as well as disabled , ill , and elderly adults on more than 640,000 occasions -- meeting the emergency needs of 4.6 million employees			2
i know about @entity117 because like professor @entity11 , i 'm also a working parent , and @entity138 , the parent company of @entity0 , is a client			2
when my children were younger and i worked for another network , i 've used a similar center on various occasions when my regular child care imploded			1
but unlike professor @entity11 , if my son or daughter was ill , i thought ahead and had a plan			1
i never brought a sick child to work			0
and the fact that professor @entity11 did on august 28 only fueled the uproar over her actions			2
breastfeeding intuitive and easy ? no ! i recognize @entity138 is a big company and many smaller organizations and schools of higher learning do n't have the budget to offer backup child care to employees			1
but that 's not an oversight in my thinking -- it 's central to my point			0
perhaps in this election year , uneven access to emergency backup child care is something president @entity169 and @entity171 presidential nominee @entity170 need to address for all working parents			1
while i am not a single mother , i 've known my own brand of child - care challenges			0
my husband 's parents never wanted to play backup babysitter -- they had their own full and busy lives -- and my parents are deceased			0
in reality , working parents always need to have reliable , go - to options when a child gets sick -- a friend , a neighbor , a relative -- and if you ca n't come up with even one alternative , you may want to consider if you 're honoring your end of the bargain when accepting a job			0
there does seem to be good news in all this , particularly for professor pine			0
between 2009 and 2011 , @entity117 reports , the field of higher education has seen the second fastest growth rate of all industries it serves in terms of number of employees covered by backup child care			1
@entity204 , a spokeswoman for the company says , " one of the reasons we are seeing a shift in demand for backup care in higher ed is the changing demographic makeup of college faculty and professors			0
" and if @entity2 chooses to move in that direction , professor @entity11 might feel she has real backup child care options as a working parent , instead of believing , as she currently seems to , that she has no choice at all			1
