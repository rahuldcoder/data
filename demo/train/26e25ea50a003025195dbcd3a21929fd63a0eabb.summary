dumb as a limestone brick : @entity3 's misguided bid for tourists the great idea : turn a small @entity7 town into a tourist mecca for lovers of limestone block			2
the great big problem : limestone block is not as big a draw as you might think			2
cost to taxpayers : $ 700,000 despite being the undisputed " @entity17 , " @entity16 , @entity3 , always had a hard time figuring out how to parlay its claim to fame into a thriving tourism industry			1
that is , until @entity24 member @entity23 came up with a brilliant plan			2
in the late 1970s , @entity26 proposed that @entity16 build a @entity28 - style theme park			2
but , instead of cartoon characters , the park 's main attraction would be limestone , featuring a 95 - foot - high replica of the @entity34 built out of ( you guessed it ) local limestone blocks			2
and , on the off chance that a scale model of one world wonder would n't be exciting enough , @entity23 added plans for an 800 - foot - long replica of the @entity43			2
while the power of limestone over the vacationing public is debatable , @entity23 convinced the @entity48 's @entity47 to believe in his dream -- to the tune of $ 700,000			1
unfortunately , those funds dried up quickly , thanks to @entity54 senator @entity53 ( famous for his " @entity55 " ridiculing government waste ) , who called attention to the project			2
the town was left deep in debt , unable to even pay @entity26 's salary			2
today , the abandoned project is little more than a giant rock pile			2
how to build a canal in four easy centuries : dividing and conquering in @entity66 the great idea : build a shipping shortcut through the middle of @entity66			2
the great big problem : the plan would effectively turn half the state into an island			2
cost to taxpayers : $ 120 million , in this century anyway			1
the @entity76 was one of those ideas that refused to go away			0
first proposed by @entity81 settlers in the 1570s , the canal was supposed to cut through the middle of the peninsula to connect the @entity85 with the @entity86 , significantly shortening shipping times			0
however , after @entity66 came under @entity90 control in the early 19th century , @entity88 surveyed the land and decided that any canal that would turn a huge chunk of the state into an island just was n't feasible , and the plan was scrapped			0
fast forward to the @entity97			0
suddenly , any project that would create 6,000 jobs seemed like a pretty good idea			0
president @entity101 allocated emergency funds to the canal , and digging commenced in 1935			0
a year later , progress stalled due to environmental concerns , then picked back up , then stalled again , and the cycle continued until 1963 , when president @entity107 allocated $ 1 million to the project			1
work began after @entity107 's death and continued for seven years , but -- yet again -- concerns about the canal 's environmental impact ground progress to a halt			1
finally , in 1991 , the canal ( by this time a $ 120 million partial scar across the middle of the state ) was officially pronounced dead			1
the land was converted into a greenway named after @entity120 , the environmentalist who 'd led the charge against the canal in the 1960s			0
the mess with @entity124 : superconducting that 's less than super the great idea : build a miracle machine that can replicate the @entity129 , help treat life - threatening illnesses , and maybe even unfold the mysteries of the universe			1
the great big problem : you get what you pay for -- and miracle machines cost way , way too much			0
cost to taxpayers : roughly $ 12 billion -- and the lives of billions of innocent atoms			1
few government projects have ever been announced with the level of fanfare reserved for the @entity144			1
housed in a 54 - mile underground tunnel beneath @entity147 , @entity124 , the @entity145 was designed to accelerate beams of subatomic particles to fantastic speeds and then crash the particles into one another , purportedly generating huge amounts of energy			1
advocates believed the machine would be able to simulate the conditions present during the @entity129 , thus allowing scientists to gain new insights into the very nature of matter			0
but many @entity145 fans made even bolder statements about the machine 's capabilities , pointing out that other devices using similar technology had been used to treat cancer and learn more about @entity169			0
as potential uses for the machine grew , however , so did the cost ballooning from an original estimate of less than $ 5 billion to just under $ 12 billion			1
finally , in the midst of the 1993 budget - cutting boom , @entity88 pulled the plug on the project , with less than one - third of the tunnel finished			1
for a while , it was used to store @entity181 cups , but then it was sold off to private businesses for pennies on the dollar			0
although scientists ( and the citizens of @entity147 ) still mourn the loss of this major research center , there are several other machines in the world that do basically the same thing on a smaller scale			0
they 're called particle accelerators , and the largest one is a mere 5 miles in diameter			0
building a better future , one spokesmodel at a time : @entity201 school hits @entity202 the great idea : when creating jobs for the unemployed , cater to the pretty people first			1
the great big problem : regional dignity seems to have gone overlooked			0
cost to taxpayers : 1 million euros ( about $ 1.2 million @entity90 ) in 2003 , the @entity209 came up with a novel solution for lowering soaring unemployment levels among young people in @entity202 's @entity215 region history 's first job - creation program catering solely to the physically attractive			1
with a grant of 1 million euros , the @entity209 opened @entity217 , a quasi-educational program designed to train students to become tv game show hostesses			0
the eight - month program , labeled " bimbo school " by critics , offered courses on diction , make - up , and other skills necessary to get a job on one of the country 's many popular game and variety shows			0
the school 's de facto policy of discriminating against all of @entity215 's less toothsome residents aside , @entity217 also failed to admit enough students to offer any kind of relief to the region 's unemployed population ( which was estimated to be 50 percent of young people )			1
fewer than 100 spots were made available to the 1,200 @entity201 wannabes who applied			0
worse still , even those who did make the cut received a whopping 2 euros for every class attended , as well as auditions for parts in the shows @entity217 produced for @entity202 television stations			0
meanwhile , rejected applicants remained unemployed and got daily , televised reminders of how unappealing they were			0
leave it to beavers : troubles with the @entity256 the great idea : dam the @entity258 in @entity259			1
the great big problem : holding back the river 's 80 billion gallons of water proved more difficult than engineers thought			1
cost to taxpayers : $ 100 million in construction fees and another $ 2 billion in damage			1
the planning and design phase of the @entity256 in southeastern @entity259 took nearly three decades ; the construction took a little more than four years			1
the dam 's total collapse , however , took exactly one afternoon			1
realizing you just wasted some serious tax dollars ? priceless			1
built for just under $ 100 million between 1972 and 1976 , the @entity256 was supposed to provide irrigation , electricity , and ( ironically ) flood prevention for the thousands of people living in its 305 - foot - tall shadow			1
but as the reservoir reached its full capacity on june 3 , 1976 , several small leaks began to appear in the dam			0
crews were sent to patch the holes , but larger cracks followed , letting through water that eventually engulfed bulldozers and sent workmen fleeing in terror			0
then , on june 5 , the dam suddenly collapsed , sending more than 80 billion gallons of water rushing out of the reservoir and into the valley below			2
by the time the water stabilized more than five hours later , 11 people had died and hundreds of thousands of acres of land had been flooded			0
despite the estimated $ 2 billion in damages , officials seriously considered constructing a new dam for several years afterward			1
eventually the idea was abandoned , but more recently , the flood site has gotten some good use as the route of the @entity305			0

millions of dollars spent on *useless* , failed or cancelled projects
building @entity256 took four years ; collapse took one afternoon
$ 12 billion superconductor in @entity124 was never finished
