@entity0 -- it 's almost crunch time			2
the midterm elections are a little less than seven months away			1
up for grabs in november 's midterms is control of the @entity7 , where @entity8 hold a 55 - 45 majority but are defending 21 of the 36 seats up in november , with half of those seats in red or purple states			1
@entity8 need a net gain of 17 seats this november to win back control of the @entity18 - led @entity17 , a feat that political handicappers say is unlikely in part because of the shrinking number of competitive congressional districts			1
and do n't forget the battle in the states , where three dozen governorships are at stake			1
the @entity18 is defending 22 of the 36 seats up for grabs in november			2
key races to watch in 2014 here are seven important dates and times between now and november that could affect the midterm elections : mid-april : @entity35 numbers -- the @entity36 will release its last enrollment report for the @entity35 's first year , including key demographic information			1
the key number that will affect the political arguments over @entity35 will be the percentage of younger people who have signed up for health insurance through the federal and state exchanges			1
republicans , who oppose the federal health care law , are attempting to frame the midterms as a referendum on the sweeping measure , which is president @entity51 's signature domestic achievement			1
may 20 : @entity53 and @entity54 primaries -- seven of the 12 @entity18 senators running for re-election this year did face , or still are facing , primary challenges from the right			2
the most high - profile of that group is senate minority leader @entity62 of @entity53			2
he 's being challenged by @entity64 businessman @entity63 , who enjoys the backing of some tea party groups and other conservative organizations			0
@entity68 's considered the overwhelming favorite to win the primary , but his margin of victory may tell us a lot about his prospects in the general election , where he 'll face off against @entity53 secretary of state @entity77			0
@entity54 is one of five other states holding primaries on may 20			1
all eyes are on the @entity18 battle to succeed retiring @entity18 sen. @entity83			0
along with @entity53 , @entity54 is the only other state where @entity8 right now hope to go on the offense in the battle for the @entity7			0
there are five major candidates fighting for the @entity18 nomination , and if one of the more conservative contenders wins , @entity8 think their candidate , @entity91 ( daughter of former sen. @entity92 ) , may have a good shot at winning the seat			0
if there 's no outright winner on primary day , a runoff for @entity54 's @entity97 nomination will take place on july 22			0
june 3 : @entity103 and @entity104 primaries -- of the @entity18 senators facing primary challenges , @entity105 is the most threatened			2
the six - term senator from @entity103 is being challenged by state lawmaker @entity109 , who enjoys strong backing from conservative groups and tea party activists			0
and last month , @entity109 landed the endorsement of former @entity115 gov. @entity114			0
the 2008 @entity18 vice presidential nominee still carries a lot of pull with many on the right			0
if @entity109 wins , it could be one of the few victories this year for the grassroots in their battle with the party establishment			0
" @entity109 has the best chance of any anti-establishment @entity7 hopeful to knock off an incumbent , and the defeat of @entity105 would send shock waves through both the national media and the @entity18 , " said @entity127 , editor and publisher of the nonpartisan @entity127			0
@entity104 is one of seven states holding primaries on june 3			1
several @entity18 candidates are vying for their party 's @entity7 nomination in the race for the seat of retiring five - term @entity8 sen. @entity142			0
the outcome of @entity104 's @entity18 primary could determine how good a chance the @entity18 has in november against rep. @entity146 , who hopes to keep the seat in @entity8 hands			0
late june : all eyes will be on the @entity150 as it is likely to issue what may be a major ruling on the @entity35			1
the justices will rule on a lawsuit , brought against the federal government by the family - owned arts - and - crafts chain @entity157 , over a requirement under the health care law that certain for - profit corporations provide contraception coverage to their workers			2
at issue is whether secular , private corporations can claim a religious exemption from federal laws			0
there 's a companion appeal from @entity169 , owed by a @entity171 family in @entity172			0
the rulings in these cases could clarify whether some businesses have a religious liberty right , or whether such constitutional protections apply only to individuals			0
the rulings will also put @entity35 right back in the political spotlight , giving either @entity8 or @entity18 some bragging rights			1
june 30 : the last day of june is also the last day of the second quarter of fundraising			2
starting july 1 , campaigns and party committees begin reporting their cash hauls to the @entity186 ( the filings are due by july 15 ) and in many cases publicize their fundraising figures in the media			1
the numbers will be scrutinized , as campaign cash is one of the key indicators of a candidate 's or party 's strength			2
late summer / early fall : some states will begin to announce how much health insurance premiums will rise in 2015 for policies acquired through the @entity35			1
even though health insurance premiums tend to rise every year , big jumps in premiums could damage democrats who defend the health care law			0
october 3 : the @entity207 releases the september unemployment report , the final jobs numbers before midterm elections			1
while @entity35 is an important issue in the 2014 contests , the economy remains the top issue on the minds of @entity216 voters , and the top economic concern remains jobs			1
just as the final jobs report before the 2012 presidential election was in the spotlight , this report will also face a lot of scrutiny			2
@entity1 @entity226 producer @entity225 and @entity1 @entity150 producer @entity227 contributed to this report .			1

*obamacare* numbers , primaries in a number of states will influence those elections
