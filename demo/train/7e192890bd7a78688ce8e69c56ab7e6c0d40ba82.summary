-- after 17 years as @entity3 's archbishop , the ailing cardinal @entity1 welcomed his pending retirement saturday with praise for his successor -- and words of relief			1
the @entity9 on saturday announced that @entity10 had accepted @entity1 's resignation as archbishop and chosen @entity13 , bishop of @entity14 , @entity15 , as the man who will succeed @entity1 in leading the @entity3 area 's 2.3 million @entity17 in november			1
the 77 - year - old @entity1 , who has been battling kidney cancer , told reporters that he 'll look forward to advising the @entity10 as cardinal through various committees , as health permits			1
but leaving the archbishop post will be a relief , partly because health problems have made it difficult for him to focus fully on his duties			0
" this is a full - time job , so i am relieved and grateful that somebody who can do it full time will be in charge , " @entity1 said at a news conference in @entity3 on saturday morning			1
@entity1 , the first @entity3 native to lead the archdiocese , submitted his resignation when he turned 75 in 2012			1
church law requires bishops to offer to quit at 75 , though it is not uncommon for the @entity10 to let them continue in their posts			2
yet his required resignation offer also came in a year he was diagnosed with cancer			2
the cancer was dormant for a year after chemotherapy in 2012 , but it showed new signs of activity this year , the @entity3 archdiocese said			1
after more chemotherapy , the archdiocese said in august that @entity1 agreed to participate in a @entity51 trial of a new drug aimed at boosting his immune system to fight the disease , according to the archdiocese			2
@entity10 to visit @entity56 next year for conference @entity13 , talking to reporters with @entity1 , said one of this top priorities was to get to know his new flock			1
he currently serves 100,000 catholics in his @entity14 post , which he began in 2010			0
" this is an enormous upgrade , so to speak , " said @entity13 , who also was bishop of @entity65 , @entity66 , from 1998 to 2010			2
" i want to get to know each and every one of you , so i hope that you 'll be patient with me			0
" he said he would know which priorities to stress after he spends more time in the area			0
but when asked what his priorities were for hispanics , who are a significant portion of @entity3 's @entity17 , he offered what he thought politicians should be doing			0
" we need comprehensive immigration reform , " @entity13 said			0
" ... every day we delay it is a day too long , and we should move on it today			0
" @entity13 , like many archbishops settling into their new jobs in recent years , also will spend time assessing where his archdiocese is with priesthood sex abuse allegations			2
the church has been hit by many accusations of child abuse from across the @entity90 and @entity91 , stretching back decades			0
in 2011 , plantiffs ' attorneys announced the @entity3 archdiocese agreed to pay $ 3.2 million to settle a 2007 lawsuit that alleged church leaders failed to remove a priest that they knew had sexually abused minors			0
in january 2014 , the archdiocese said it would release to a plaintiffs ' lawyer documents related to 30 priests who 'd been accused of abusing minors during the last 50 years			0
the archdiocese said 95 % of those cases happened before 1988 , and no priest with a substantiated allegation of sexual abuse of a minor currently served in the archdiocese			0
" ( @entity13 will ) be fully briefed , " @entity1 said saturday			1
" when i ( became archbishop ) , i sat down for half a day and went through every single case , and that will happen here , too			0
" @entity1 praised @entity13 as a man of " deep faith , a quick intelligence , personal commitment and varied pastoral experience			2
" @entity1 and @entity13 , a @entity119 native , will remain in their current posts until @entity13 is installed as @entity3 archbishop november 18			1
pope @entity123 named @entity1 as @entity3 archbishop in 1997			1
a year later , the @entity124 elevated @entity1 to cardinal , enabling him to participate in the conclaves that selected the next two @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity10 .			1
