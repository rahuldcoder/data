-- two @entity2 scientists won the @entity3 in chemistry wednesday for their work revealing protein receptors that tell cells what is going on in and around the human body			1
their achievements have allowed drug makers to develop medication with fewer side effects			1
research spanning four decades by @entity15 and @entity16 on " g - protein - coupled receptors " has increased understanding of how cells sense chemicals in the bloodstream and external stimuli like light , according to the @entity24 , which awarded the prize			1
@entity15 began the research by tracking adrenalin receptors			2
the @entity3 announcement apparently set off some of the excitement hormone in his own body			1
" i 'm feeling very , very excited , " he said in a predawn phone call from the @entity2 to the committee in @entity33 , @entity34 , which announced the winners at 5:45 a.m. et. @entity3 in medicine awarded to sir @entity37 and @entity38 " did i even have any inkling that it was coming ? " @entity15 said			1
" i 'd have to say no. " he contacted @entity40 via a @entity42 video call to celebrate the news after receiving the call from the @entity3 committee			1
@entity15 , with the @entity46 and @entity47 in @entity48 , @entity49 , began tracking cell receptors with radioactive substances in 1968			0
in the 1980s , @entity40 , from @entity53 in @entity54 , joined the research to isolate the human gene that produces the adrenalin receptor , the academy said			0
" @entity40 achieved another break - through " in 2011 , the academy said in a news release : a photographic image of a hormone triggering a receptor to send an impulse into its cell			0
" this image is a molecular masterpiece -- the result of decades of research , " the academy said			0
humans experience g - protein - coupled receptors most consciously when they smell , see and taste , the academy explained in a background document			0
but within the body , they sense " signaling substances , such as adrenalin , serotonin , histamine and dopamine			2
" " they serve as the gateway to the cells , " @entity15 said			2
" around half of all medications act through these receptors , among them beta blockers , antihistamines and various kinds of psychiatric medications , " the academy explained			0
in the case of adrenalin -- known in science as epinephrine -- receptors in cells of the heart make it beat faster and receptors in muscle cells signal them to activate to mobilize a person 's strength			2
newly anointed @entity106 can use the energy boost			0
" i 'm thinking that this is going to be a very hectic day , " he said			0
" i was going to get a haircut , " he revealed , triggering laughter at the academy , as he explained that he really felt he needed one			0
" but i 'm afraid it will probably have to be postponed			0
" @entity3 in chemistry have gone to predominantly to organic ( or carbon - based ) chemistry , particularly to discoveries in the area of life sciences , such as genetics			1
this year 's monetary award will be 8 million @entity34 kronor ( about $ 1.2 million )			0
this represents a drop of 20 % , compared with last year , from 10 million @entity34 kronor , and is due to the turbulence that has hit financial markets			0
last year , @entity128 scientist @entity127 from @entity129 won the award for the discovery of quasicrystals , which was made in 1982 and " fundamentally altered how chemists conceive of solid matter , " according to the @entity24			0

as a side effect , their work lays down principles that could lead to quantum computers , which are astronomically fast computers that would radically change human life , if ever invented			1
on monday , the @entity152 awarded the prize for physiology or medicine to sir @entity37 and @entity156 jointly for their discovery that stem cells can be made of mature cells and need not necessarily be taken from fetuses or embryos			1
read more : @entity3 in medicine awarded for groundbreaking cell research the committee also will announce prizes in literature , peace and economics			1
since 1901 , the committee has handed out the @entity3 in chemistry 103 times			1
in certain years , mainly during @entity172 , no prize in chemistry was awarded			2
the youngest recipient was @entity174 , who won in 1935 at the age of 35			0
the oldest chemistry laureate was @entity177 , who was 85 when he received the prize in 2002			2
@entity179 was the only scientist to win the chemistry prize twice for his work related to the structure of proteins and @entity184			1
there is a fine line between the science of chemistry and the fields of physics and biology			2
famed female scientist @entity193 of @entity135 , for example , won @entity3 honors for her work in radiophysics in 1903 and then again in 1911 for discoveries in radiochemistry .			1

new : the prize recognizes work revealing how cells sense chemicals
new : their work has allowed drug makers to develop medication with fewer side effects
@entity3 in chemistry have often gone to life sciences
other work *praised* this week also has deep *implications* for *society*
