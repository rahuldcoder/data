-- over the past few months , newspapers , websites and cable news programs have implied 2010 would be a year of remarkable progress for women in politics			1
with a record number of women running for the @entity12 ( 138 ) and @entity13 ( 15 ) , pundits , pollsters and politicians assumed it was the dawn of a new day , one in which @entity15 and @entity16 understood the importance of electing women			1
high - profile female candidates , many with interesting personal stories and personality traits , fostered the speculation that 2010 might very well be another " @entity24			1
" but it was n't			0
in fact , wednesday morning 's headlines did not even mention women			2
obviously , @entity15 losses and @entity16 's ascent correctly took center stage			0
but some important points about women in politics slipped through the cracks			2
first and foremost , for the first time in 30 years , the number of women serving in the @entity37 @entity12 will likely decrease			1
a few contests remain too close to call			0
@entity15 incumbents @entity40 and @entity42 are fighting to hold onto their seats			0
@entity16 challengers @entity44 and @entity46 are trailing by only a few thousand votes to the male incumbents they hope to unseat			0
but only if women win all of these races ( an unlikely scenario ) will the total number of women serving in the @entity12 hold steady at 73			1
the story in the @entity13 is similar			0
depending on the outcome of @entity59 's write - in bid in @entity60 , women will either continue to occupy 17 seats or they will drop to 16			2
therefore , the best - case scenario for women 's overall representation is they will continue to comprise 17 percent of @entity65			2
second , a net loss of women in @entity65 was a likely outcome heading into election night			2
we just did not seem to talk much about it			0
in an election cycle in which women competed for fewer than one - third of the 435 seats at stake in the @entity12 and only 15 seats in the @entity13 , substantial or even incremental gains for women were almost impossible			1
and because 77 percent of the women in the @entity12 and @entity13 were @entity15 , women were in a particularly precarious position as they faced an @entity82 , anti-establishment electorate			1
the election results are consistent with what the political landscape portended			0
in the @entity12 , at least nine female @entity15 incumbents lost their races			1
that number may climb to 11 when the votes are fully tallied			2
only one out of 28 female @entity15 challengers knocked off a @entity16 incumbent			0
and six of the nine @entity15 women running in open seats lost their bids			0
@entity15 women held four of their five seats in the @entity13 , although no female @entity15 challengers or open - seat candidates won			1
importantly , @entity15 women fared no worse than their male @entity15 counterparts ; of course , their male @entity15 counterparts did not fare well			0
the only way to compensate for these losses would have been with substantial increases of women in the @entity12 and @entity13 on the @entity16 side of the aisle			1
the @entity110 ran women in only three of the 30 races that presented the best opportunities to gain seats			1
so even though all 15 female @entity16 incumbents who sought re-election won and even with victories by six @entity16 women challengers and two @entity16 women competing in open - seat contests , the opportunity for gains was minimal			1
@entity16 women will continue to comprise just 9 percent of their caucus in the new @entity65			0
third , the loss of @entity15 control in the @entity12 is especially detrimental for women because opportunities for leadership positions are based on seniority			1
not only will @entity132 no longer be speaker of the @entity12 , but @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 will also no longer serve as committee chairs			1
early reports of the new @entity16 leadership include no women 's names			1
i do not want to minimize that last night 's elections resulted in an increase of the total number of @entity16 women in @entity65			1
and i have no interest in detracting attention from the successes several women saw last night			0
@entity151 , for instance , became @entity153 's first female governor			2
@entity155 's win in the @entity157 gubernatorial race means that she will be the first latina ever to occupy a governor 's mansion			0
cases such as these , however , are few and far between			0
focusing on those wins obscures the reality that 2010 did not represent another " @entity24			0
" it likely moved us backward on the path to gender parity			0
the opinion expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity172 .			2

@entity172 : number of female candidates made 2010 seem like *big* year for women
but when vote count is over , number will likely stay right where it is , she says
she says shift in @entity12 pushed @entity186 women out of leadership positions
*lawless* : women winning governor races significant , but not same as overall gains
