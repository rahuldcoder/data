for more than nine years on the throne , @entity1 's @entity0 faced a tough balancing act			1
calls to modernize his kingdom were constant			0
so , too , were objections from hard - line conservatives who chafed at change			0
supporters hailed @entity0 , who died friday at age 90 , as a reformer			1
and in the @entity14 , leaders have long described him as a close ally in the @entity16 who played a key role in bringing stability to the region			2
he famously held hands with president @entity21 as the two leaders met in @entity23 in 2005			2
with the wealth of his oil - rich nation behind him , @entity0 wielded far - reaching influence both inside and outside @entity1			1
as the @entity14 - led campaign against @entity32 in @entity33 and @entity34 ramped up , his leadership was a " game changer , " @entity27 , a professor of political science at @entity29 , told @entity3 last year			0
" it was @entity0 who put all the moral , the political weight behind the international coalition to stop @entity32 's momentum , " he said			1
@entity14 secretary of state @entity42 described @entity0 as a " revered leader " around the world			1
" he was so proud of the @entity47 's journey , " @entity42 said in a statement , " a brave partner in fighting violent extremism who proved just as important as a proponent of peace			2
" under @entity0 's leadership , the country slowly squashed @entity54 , capturing or killing its leaders in the kingdom , forcing the remnants underground and sidelining radical preachers			1
in 2005 , @entity0 launched a campaign through the country 's media and its mosques to educate @entity1 citizens about the danger of extremism			1
at the same time , the king -- unlike some of his predecessors -- began investing the country 's oil wealth in creating jobs for the future			2
a massive building program , called @entity74 , was one example -- and an acknowledgment that oil money would n't last forever			0
the king focused on ramping up education , too			0
@entity79 was designed to be the first coed university in the country			0
some of his more conservative ministers -- his half - brothers -- bridled at his changes			0
they were n't the only @entity1 disappointed with his leadership			2
many women had hoped for greater independence under his rule			0
but their dreams were not realized during his lifetime			0
he initiated forums for women to debate issues , but failed in the face of opposition to give them real freedom			0
under @entity1 's strict rules , women can not marry , leave the country , go to school or open bank accounts without permission from a male guardian , who usually is the father or husband			1
much of public life is segregated by gender and women are not allowed to drive			0
even as he ran up against limits to what he could achieve inside @entity1 , beyond its borders @entity0 saw the kingdom 's stature grow			1
it was the only @entity120 nation with a seat at the @entity122 , and also became the lead @entity120 nation in the @entity14 - led coalition to eradicate @entity32 in @entity33 and @entity34			0
@entity0 bolstered the desert kingdom 's defense forces with a massive $ 150 billion infusion , and he backed @entity130 's military rulers who ousted the @entity131 from power			1
a spokesman for @entity135 secretary - general ban ki - moon praised @entity0 's " efforts to address regional and international challenges at a time of turmoil and rapid change , and to promote dialogue among the world 's faiths			1
" @entity14 president @entity144 pointed to @entity0 's work advancing the @entity146 , which attempts to solve the long - simmering conflict between @entity148 and @entity149			1
" @entity0 left a tangible legacy that can still point the way toward peace in the @entity16 , " the @entity135 secretary - general 's spokesman said			1
in 2010 , @entity155 called @entity0 one of the world 's 10 most respected leaders , praising his efforts " to lift his ultraconservative country from the dark ages			1
" " he 's given the go - ahead to modernize schools , has appointed women to high office , and invested in science and technology education and nuclear power initiatives			0
he 's also proven a stalwart ally against @entity172 extremism , delivering a much - applauded speech in @entity174 that called on @entity175 to embrace ' the spirit of tolerance , moderation , and balance , ' " the @entity155 article said			1
but not everyone felt like @entity0 deserved his reformist moniker			2
another headline in @entity183 that year described him this way : " those who predicted the @entity1 monarch would bring real change to the kingdom had it wrong			2
his real goal has been to tighten his family 's grip on power			0
" " despite the new levels of openness enjoyed by @entity1 citizens , @entity0 is not leading the kingdom on the path to political liberalism			1
just the opposite : while making small social and economic concessions , the king is in fact turning the clock back in @entity1 , using his popularity to confront clergy and restore the kind of unchecked authority his family enjoyed in the 1970s , " @entity201 , an associate professor of history at @entity203 , wrote in an analysis for the magazine			2
@entity215 , a former @entity1 political prisoner , told @entity3 on thursday that it is n't accurate to portray @entity0 as a reformer			1
under @entity0 's rule , he said , political prisoners were harshly punished and extremism flourished in @entity1 even as leaders claimed to oppose it			1
" it 's the epicenter of extremism , of terrorism , of funding terrorism			0
... reforms in @entity1 do not exist			2
this is an absolute monarchy , let 's be honest , " @entity215 said			0
" this is an absolute monarchy where the government policies are controlled by one family			0
" @entity3 's @entity234 , @entity235 and @entity236 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 's @entity0 has died after more than nine years on the throne
