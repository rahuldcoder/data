being in the middle of an animal sanctuary in @entity3 , @entity0 was a huge change from the rugged @entity6 jungle where the @entity7 : @entity9 crew and i had spent the last week and a half			1
we did n't set out to go to an animal sanctuary during @entity7 : @entity9			1
one of the local people we were working with suggested it while we were filming in the rainforest			2
we had a few hours in the schedule between leaving @entity18 and flying out of @entity3 , so we decided to go see some of the animals we were n't able to see while we were exploring			2
read more : the devastation of @entity0 's forests we had a few obstacles to overcome , as usual , like rain and the nightmarish @entity3 traffic , but we arrived at @entity0 around lunchtime			1
at first , this seemed like a typical zoo tour			2
but , the head of @entity0 had other plans for us			1
we were going to see the highlight of the work being done at this facility : the animals bred in captivity to help preserve the species			2
we went to this small playroom which was the baby animal nursery			1
here , there were a few caretakers and several @entity6 orangutan babies			2
there were also three baby cats : a leopard , a bengal tiger and a @entity6 tiger			0
@entity45 and i did a debrief interview for the last show of @entity7 : @entity9 and we talked about the experience at @entity0			1
we did n't include it in the show , but he described the scene : " we get in and the whole crew , everybody 's eyes just got big and there 's lots of giggling and energy			1
these are just the most adorable things on the planet			0
" read more : the battle to save @entity9 's elephants it 's an experience none of us will ever forget			1
each of us was able to hold one of the tigers			0
we even talked about what it would be like to be baby animal caretakers			1
after the initial excitement wore off , @entity45 reminded us that this is ultimately a sad situation			0
the @entity6 tiger cub had a defect in its back leg and was rejected by its mother			0
these animals will grow to adulthood and likely never live in the wild			0
the greater purpose of this nursery of babies is to make sure their species does n't go extinct			0
it 's a reminder of the tragic circumstances going on in the rainforst of @entity9 right now			1
if wildlife habitat can not be saved , this kind of facility could be the only place where @entity6 tigers , orangutans and elephants will live			0
but with all the efforts of those trying to preserve this habitat , i 'm hopeful that this worst case scenario will never become a reality			0
in 2011 : black rhino declared extinct			0
