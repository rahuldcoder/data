-- on june 2 , 2011 , i began my quest for the presidency on the farm of @entity5 and @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8			2
i said then that our country is a land of freedom and opportunity			1
i spoke of the hard work of the millions of @entity15 who built our remarkable experiment in self - government			1
they carved out of the wilderness a land of immense prosperity and unlimited potential			2
i said then that " i believe in @entity15			1
" for more than a year now , i 've carried that message across @entity15			1
as we draw close to @entity27 , it is a good moment to reflect on what it means to believe in @entity15			1
@entity15 is a place where freedom rings			1
it is a place where we can discuss our differences without fear of any consequence worse than criticism , where we can believe in whatever creed or religion we choose , where we can pursue our dreams no matter how small or grand			1
it is a place that not only cherishes freedom , but is willing to fight to defend it			1
these are the qualities that define us			2
@entity15 is a land of opportunity			1
but lately , for too many @entity15 , opportunity has not exactly come knocking			1
we 've been mired in an economic slowdown that has left millions of our fellow citizens unemployed			1
the consequences in dreams shattered , lives disrupted , plans deferred , and hopes dimmed can be found all around us			1
it has n't always been this way			2
it certainly does n't have to be this way in the future			2
we 're all in this together			2
and together we can emerge from these troubles			1
president @entity59 's op - ed : my vision for @entity15 together with @entity62 , i 've put forward an economic recovery plan consisting of five central elements that will in four years create 12 million jobs			1
we will produce more of the energy we need to heat our homes , fill our cars , and make our economy grow			2
we will stop president @entity59 's war on coal , his disdain for oil , and his effort to crimp natural gas by federal regulation of the very technology that produces it			2
we will support nuclear and renewables , but phase out subsidies once an industry is on its feet			0
we will invest in energy science and research to make discoveries that can actually change our energy world			1
by 2020 , we will achieve @entity89 energy independence			0
we will retrain our work force for the jobs of tomorrow and ensure that every child receives a quality education no matter where they live , including especially our inner cities			0
parents and students , not administrators and unions , need to have greater choice			1
our current worker retraining system is a labyrinth of federal programs that sprawls across 47 programs and nine agencies			0
we will eliminate this redundancy and empower the 50 states and the private sector to develop effective programs of their own			0
we will make trade work for @entity15			1
we 'll open more markets to @entity89 agriculture , products , and services			0
and we will finally hold accountable any nation that does n't play by the rules			0
i will stand up for the rights and interests of @entity89 workers and employers			0
your turn : what 's your vision for @entity15 ? we will restore fiscal sanity to @entity129 by bringing an end to the federal spending and borrowing binge that in just four years has added more debt held by the public than almost all previous administrations combined			1
we will put @entity15 on track to a balanced budget by eliminating unnecessary programs , by sending programs back to states where they can be managed with less abuse and less cost , and by shrinking the bureaucracy of @entity129			1
finally , we will champion small business , the great engine of job creation in our country , by reforming the tax code and updating and reshaping regulations that have suffocated economic growth			1
nothing is ever easy in @entity129 , but these goals are rooted in bipartisan agreement , and i will work with members of both parties to accomplish them			0
as governor of a state that was overwhelmingly @entity160 , i was always ready to reach across the aisle and i can proudly point to the results			0
i 've learned that when we come together to solve problems in a practical spirit , we can accomplish miracles			0
in this respect , i am offering a contrast to what we are seeing in @entity129 today			2
we 've watched as one party has pushed through its agenda without compromising with the other party			0
we 've watched gridlock and petty conflict dominate while the most important issues confronting the nation , like chronic high unemployment , go unaddressed			0
the bickering has to end			0
i will reach across the aisle to solve @entity15 's problems			1
our economic crisis not only threatens the well - being of our citizenry , it has larger consequences in other realms			2
the economic weakness of the past several years has , alarmingly , fostered weakness in our foreign policy posture			1
runaway domestic spending has led the president to propose reducing defense spending by hundreds of billions , cuts that his own secretary of defense has said would " devastate " our national security			0
the most important task for any president is set out in the preamble to our @entity198 â€” providing for the common defense			0
as commander - in - chief , i will roll back the president 's deep and arbitrary cuts to our military			0
our soldiers should never lack the tools they need to complete their mission and come home safely			0
i have always believed that the first purpose of a strong military is to prevent war			0
and preventing war is a supreme national interest			0
i will ensure that our military is strong enough that no adversary dares to challenge us			0
let us remember our history			0
we have accomplished so much , both in the world and at home			0
we 've lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty			0
we 've transformed our own society into a more perfect union			0
we 've created a land of freedom and prosperity			2
the problems we need to overcome now are not bigger than we are			2
i am offering real change and a real choice			1
