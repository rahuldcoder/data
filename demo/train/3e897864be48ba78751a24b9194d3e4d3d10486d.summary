-- " @entity1 " was canceled after only three seasons in 2007 , leaving fans hungry for some kind of closure			1
while creator @entity7 and @entity8 have teased the idea of a " @entity1 " movie in the years since , that possibility seemed to die when the studio passed on the project			1
but fans -- or " marshmallows " as they 're known -- would n't let executives keep their beloved characters from them a second time and saved the project by donating more than $ 5.7 million to a @entity20 campaign for the film earlier this year , reaching far more than the $ 2 million @entity22 required to make the movie			1
( @entity24 is the parent company of both @entity22 and @entity0 )			1
" @entity1 " the movie is now in production and will be released in theaters in 2014			1
@entity7 , @entity8 and the rest of the cast came to @entity30 to share never - before - seen footage from the film with fans and backers			1
in the movie , @entity1 returns to her hometown of @entity37 , @entity38 , for a high school reunion , bringing all the old characters back together			1
the footage reveals that @entity1 is now a lawyer in @entity44 , outlaw character @entity41 ( played by @entity43 ) is settled down and married , and @entity45 has a role in the movie			1
@entity8 spoke with @entity0 at the @entity48 at @entity30 , where she admitted how much the role of @entity1 means to her personally , what to expect on " @entity51 " season two and that time she and @entity54 © @entity53 were too busy to get married			1
@entity0 : how surprised are you by the fact that you are actually making a " @entity1 " movie ? @entity8 : at the time ( of the @entity20 campaign ) , i thought , " of course this is happening			1
this is what 's supposed to happen			2
" the farther i get from the date of that occurrence , i start to realize how absolutely farfetched this idea was to throw out into the universe			2
i start to realize the size of our balls -- what we attempted and thankfully succeeded at having happen			2
when we were talking about our @entity20 launch i had no doubt in my mind that we would make our goal because it has been discussed in every interview i 've done since the show was canceled			1
i was led to believe there was still a good amount of interest , but certainly never in a million years thought we would surpass the goal as much as we did			2
it was a ballsy response from the fans too , by the way			2
@entity0 : it was interesting to see all those @entity20 backers in the room with you			1
is it true when you said some of the creative decisions on the film reflect what you think the fans will want ? @entity8 : without question			1
@entity7 ( @entity7 ) is one of the best tv writers that 's ever existed			2
he plays to everyone 's strengths and that includes his audience and himself			2
he does n't write selfishly			2
he knows what people want to see and he gives them that			2
he 's like a really , really , really good father			2
@entity0 : is this film finally going to give you a sense of closure on " @entity1 " ? @entity8 : @entity110 could be my whole life			1
and by the way , what a lucky life it would be if it were			0
there 's no formula for it , because it just has never been done before			0
except -- and i 'm just throwing it out there -- " @entity121 " did it			0
they did a tv show and then nine movies			0
who knows ? why ca n't we make a couple films ? or continue to produce content of " @entity1 " ? it gets tricky because television contracts legally only allow you to do one episode of a different show			1
i am now the face of " @entity51			0
" so the only way i would be able to reprise @entity1 ( on tv ) is in movie form			1
@entity0 : what about if it were on @entity141 ? @entity8 : there are some loopholes that we are already investigating			1
@entity0 : when do you start shooting the next season of " @entity51 " ? @entity8 : we do n't shoot until october			1
we left season two on a real cliffhanger between @entity151 ( @entity152 ) and my character			0
i know that they 're currently breaking story lines and everyone 's pitching ideas ; i do n't really have much contribution other than being excited about it			0
the characters are definitely going to start off with a lot of tension because there were confessions of love at the end of the last episode , which just makes for a really interesting first episode of season three			0
@entity0 : when you started working on " @entity51 " did you find that developing a new tv character was difficult after investing so much in " @entity1 " and that character ? @entity8 : yes and it was very challenging as an actress to create someone i would wear so often			1
a movie is a little bit different			2
@entity1 is pretty similar to who i am -- i 'm not as frustrated as she is , i do n't think			1
i do n't have as many zingers as she does			0
i certainly throw them out there , they just do n't land as often as when she says them			0
it did feel uncomfortable the first few episodes i played @entity188 because i was in a television situation again and i was n't @entity1			1
i do n't think at the time i identified it as " i 'm not @entity1 , " it just felt new and unexplored			1
now i 'm very comfortable with it simply because of the length of time i 've played her			0
no job i 've ever had has been as big of a deal to my real life as @entity8 ( as " @entity1 " )			1
@entity0 : has the success of the " @entity1 " movie opened the door for any canceled show to make a comeback ? @entity8 : i certainly hope so			1
the way i see it is that @entity20 is the best example of " @entity207			1
" if the people want it , the people can make it			0
that 's the beauty behind a public funding forum			0
i hope it opens up a lot of doors for fan bases that do n't feel heard with the content they would like to see , but i do n't think it will put the studio system out of business			0
i do n't think it 's the end result for everybody , but i really like the fact that the fans are my boss			2
@entity0 : is there a tv show or movie you would support on @entity20 if one needed it ? @entity8 : " @entity232			1
" i will be the first donor			0
@entity0 : you and @entity53 recently announced on @entity234 that you are finally getting married			2
can you explain why you wanted to hold out until marriage equality was secured in @entity38 ? @entity8 : i did not feel comfortable taking a right that was denied to some of my best friends			2
i would want someone to stand up for me if i was denied a right in this country that prides itself on having equal rights for everyone			0
i believe that gay citizens of this country deserve to share not only the label of marriage but also the rights behind it			0
there are over 1,100 rights denied to a couple when you ca n't legally get married			0
i find that to be mind - boggling			0
@entity53 and i both very much wanted to wait because if we did do something for our wedding half the people we would be inviting could n't celebrate the same right			0
but when we had a baby it became clear as to why we 're fighting for this right , because we do n't have some rights in regard to the baby that married couples do			0
i choose to be on the right side of history and i know in my heart that ( equality ) is what 's right			0
@entity0 : when will you actually get married ? @entity8 : i do n't know			1
we almost did it on the day ( of the @entity277 decision ) out of principle but we were both busy			0
we do n't really want a wedding , though			0
it 's too much stress , but we do really want to sign those papers			0
if anything just for the baby 's sake			0
@entity0 : what 's the cutest thing your daughter @entity290 has done ? @entity8 : existing ! she 's my best friend			1
laying there is extremely cute to me			0
it 's ecstasy for me .			0
