-- former gov. @entity1 recently argued in an op - ed that @entity4 voters will represent the margin of victory in the 15 swing states that will decide who will win the race for the @entity10			1
is his political intuition right ? and if it is , how do both parties significantly increase their chances of winning the @entity4 vote ? determining what qualifies as a swing state is not an exact science , but the best estimate nine months out is as follows : @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34			1
the key for political parties is registering hispanics to vote			0
according to the @entity39 , 84 % of hispanic registered voters reported voting in 2008			1
in @entity30 , not generally considered a " hispanic state , " from 2000 to 2010 the @entity4 population grew 111 %			1
between january 2008 and november 4 , 2008 , @entity4 voter registration in @entity30 grew by 62 % , from 42,000 to 68,000			1
@entity44 won the state by only 14,177 votes			0
since then , @entity4 voter registration in @entity30 has nearly doubled to 130,615			1
according to the @entity39 , in 2010 there were 492,330 @entity48 of voting age in @entity30 , representing a clear opportunity for both parties			1
in a tight race , @entity4 voters could be the margin of victory in 12 of the 15 swing states			1
( for more state by state data , click here ) three important points about @entity4 swing voters : -- @entity37 lean @entity62 , but it 's not a base @entity62 vote			1
hispanics cast their ballots on issues and in favor of the candidates rather than for the party , much like 40 % of the population , which is now considered independent			2
-- campaigns need to communicate to @entity37 in both @entity74 and @entity75			0
a strategic move behind president @entity44 winning 67 % of @entity4 vote was his campaign 's outspending @entity79 in the @entity75 language media by five to one			2
-- @entity4 adults are more engaged in the social web than non-hispanics , over-indexing as creators , critics , collectors , joiners in and spectators of social networks			2
in addressing the concerns of this demographic , no candidate can ignore the issue of immigration reform , particularly when it comes to young , first - time voters			2
each month 50,000 hispanics in the @entity98 turn 18			0
these young voters power @entity37 social networks , connecting on @entity101 and tweeting voters across the country			0
imagine the response when the hardworking mom or dad of these young voters is called a " criminal " by a candidate			0
a recent @entity111 survey found that @entity48 , by 91 % , support legislation known as the @entity113 that would give legal status to illegal immigrants who earn college degrees or serve in the military for two years			0
imagine the waves across social media when the @entity113 is not aggressively pursued or summarily dismissed			0
and immigration -- and its power to alienate or attract voters -- is the key for both parties , not just @entity125			1
yet , so far for both parties , immigration has been kryptonite			2
president @entity44 broke his promise to introduce an immigration reform bill during his first year in office			0
he deported 1.2 million latinos , including 46,000 parents of @entity98 citizens			0
his draconian policies left thousands of frightened children languishing in foster care , which brought an onslaught of negative spanish - language media			0
heading into the presidential campaign , president @entity44 's approval rating among @entity48 has plunged 36 points since april 2009 -- from 85 % to 49 % , according to a recent @entity111 survey			0
@entity44 's potential opponent , @entity125 front - runner @entity142 , wants to make life so unbearable for hispanics working here illegally that they will " self - deport			0
" passing apartheid - like laws to pressure @entity4 undocumented workers to leave the country is central to @entity142 's platform			2
witness the laws passed in @entity152 , @entity20 and @entity153 , whose chief architect , @entity156 secretary of state @entity154 , happily endorsed @entity142 , advises the campaign and acts as a surrogate			0
to win over @entity4 voters , both president @entity44 and the @entity125 nominee need to smother the kryptonite that the issue of immigration has become with a lead blanket of comprehensive immigration reform , supported by strong majorities of @entity4 swing voters and a majority of independents and the general public			1
only then can the conversation between @entity4 voters and the candidate really begin			1
in the 2008 election there was a 30 % swing of @entity4 votes away from the @entity125 's share of the vote in 2004			1
this swing vote was enough to elect @entity44 to the @entity10 and turn six states — @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity29 , @entity27 and @entity33 — from red to blue			2
any candidate or campaign that ignores @entity4 swing voters does it at their peril			1

@entity1 said @entity4 voters will represent margin of victory in 15 swing states
@entity198 says the growth of the @entity4 population is making it a crucial voting bloc
candidates from both parties must *rethink* their *stances* on immigration , he says
