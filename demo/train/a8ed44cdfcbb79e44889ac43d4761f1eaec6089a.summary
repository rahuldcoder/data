-- @entity1 probably was n't happy with wednesday night 's " @entity2			1
" for that matter , neither were police officers , the @entity5 and mindless tweeters			2
the long - running animated show 's season finale , featuring a holiday special called " the @entity10 , " managed to work in the cultural and pop - cultural obsessions of 2014 in a kitchen - sink approach			1
the episode ostensibly revolved around a generation gap between tv - watching " grandpas " ( that is , anybody not glued to his or her own portable screen ) and the hashtag - , @entity23 - obsessed younger generation , typified by @entity26 's little brother , @entity25 -- but that was just an excuse to let loose on everyone			1
for example , there was the @entity2 police force , which does n't seem to know how to handle @entity31			1
upon being notified that there 's a black man in the police station , the officers ' first reaction is to laugh , as if it 's a setup for a joke			1
" did you choke him ? " asks sgt. @entity38			0
" did you shoot him ? " the joke was later repeated			0
@entity26 has a gentle hashtag , # savethelivingroom , hijacked by television executives , thanks to a visit by @entity1 , who tells him about a tv special that 's being put together			1
the special turns out to be part of a nefarious plot to get everybody across generations watching tv -- zombified by the old electronic hearth			2
few things escaped " @entity2 's " scorn			1
a @entity61 hologram sang with a shotgun			0
tweets filled the bottom of the screen , some wondering the point of the episode			2
and @entity1 sang a version of " @entity69 " with @entity70 , offering her a drink , a reference to the @entity1 rape allegations			2
in the end , as a commentating @entity75 threatened to take over the world , the gang turned to @entity25 and his youthful friends , who sounded distinctly like the " @entity81 " crew in " a @entity80			0
" with the help of a new hashtag , # webelieveinyou , and the real - life @entity23 star @entity86 , everything was returned to normal by the end			0
few viewers , obviously aware of " @entity2 's " bent , took offense			1
in fact , many approved			0
" i think we take for granted how @entity96 can jam a heap of current issues into a storyline thats a smart and funny # @entity101 episode , " wrote @entity94			2
" i love # southpark for ripping on the police for their mistreatment of black people , " tweeted @entity102			0
" @entity109 , @entity110 , dead celebrity holograms , murdering cops , this # @entity101 episode is certainly making # @entity113 happen , " added @entity107			0
well , there 's nothing like bringing the internet together .			0

" @entity2 " takes on many of 2014 's issues
@entity1 makes an appearance ; police get *mocked*
the episode is about divisions between generations
