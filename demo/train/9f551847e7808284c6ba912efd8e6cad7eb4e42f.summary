-- fantastique @entity1 continues to make its heritage and culture easier for travelers to appreciate			1
being up - to - date on changes for 2009 will help your visit go smoothly			1
the @entity9 is planning to offer online reservations , allowing visitors to book an entry time and avoid a long wait			1
due to a smoking ban , you 'll enjoy fresh air in bars , cafes and restaurants throughout @entity1			1
the smokers have scurried outdoors to sidewalk tables ; many of those seats now come with space heaters in winter			1
if you 're traveling in @entity1 by railpass , it 's increasingly important to book trips on the @entity28 bullet trains in advance , as there 's a strict limit on the number of seats allowed for railpass holders			1
and with high gas prices -- and the recognition among @entity37 that rail travel is about as green as you can go -- trains are more crowded than ever			1
in @entity42 , the transit system has introduced a chip - card called the @entity44 , but for most tourists , the " carnets " ( packs of 10 individual tickets ) are still the better deal			1
the new @entity44 costs about $ 27 , runs strictly from monday through sunday , and requires a photo , which means it 's not shareable			1
in contrast , a 10 - ticket pack costs about $ 14 , is shareable , and has no expiration date			2
@entity42 ' @entity54 has a new modest - dress rule			2
the " no shorts " code is not strictly enforced , but inside you 're expected to be quiet and respectful			2
a new online reservation system for the @entity9 may debut in 2009 , allowing @entity9 - ists to book a half - hour time slot and avoid the notorious lines			2
at the @entity66 nearby , the section on 19th - century @entity1 military history ( " revolution to @entity65 " ) should reopen in the spring			2
the museum also has a new @entity69 wing , offering a 25 - minute film , plus a high - tech display of photos tracing the life of @entity1 's towering 20th - century figure			2
@entity42 ' market streets delight many visitors			2
while rue @entity77 ( near the @entity9 ) has become quite touristy , rue des martyrs ( at the foot of @entity80 ) is edgier and a great way to connect with workaday @entity42			2
if you 'd like to " do the @entity84 again " while ducking airborne " @entity1 " toast , you can enjoy the cult movie " @entity87 " with a @entity42 crowd friday and saturday nights in the @entity90 ( www.rocky.fr )			0
travel snapshots : @entity42 the @entity92 is undergoing extensive renovation so expect some closures			1
repair projects may close its @entity96 through june ; the @entity98 may be closed or only partially open			0
busy sightseers can save both time and money by visiting @entity102 with the @entity103			0
the pass covers most major sights in and around @entity42 , pays for itself in about three entries , and allows you to walk right by the long ticket - buying lines at places like the @entity112 , the @entity113 , the @entity115 chapel , and @entity102 ( www.parismuseumpass.com )			0
however , everyone needs to wait through any bag - check security line			0
the charming city of @entity119 , rebuilt after @entity120 when @entity121 was the prevailing style , is now served by a speedy @entity28 train , making it an easy day trip from @entity42			0
@entity119 is known for its champagne tours ( @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 ) , giant cathedral ( with @entity132 stained glass ) , and fascinating museum of the surrender ( @entity137 's final @entity136 headquarters with stirring artifacts and the document of surrender that was signed by @entity142 generals right there )			1
this year is the 65th anniversary of the d - day landings in @entity145 ; prepare for big crowds -- especially from june 1 to 10			0
also in @entity145 , a museum has opened at @entity148 , a critical crossroads between @entity150 and @entity152 beaches that saw five torrid days of fighting in 1944			0
this museum , south of @entity155 , is a hit with enthusiasts as every display case shows incredible attention to detail			1
it also has a remarkable selection of @entity164 paraphernalia for sale -- both original items and replicas			0
in @entity170 ( in the @entity169 ) the massive renovation project has nearly been completed at the medieval castle where @entity172 implored @entity1 king @entity173 to " act like a man and fight the @entity175			0
" the castle is now connected to the old town by a snazzy glass elevator			0
farther west , at @entity180 , the first stage is under way of an ambitious project to make it a true island once again			0
on the @entity185 , @entity184 has dropped the entry fee for all city museums			0
basically every sight in town -- except the @entity190 and the @entity191 -- is free to enter			0
@entity193 , just a short hop away by train , has finally reopened its prized @entity196 after extensive renovation			0
no matter what changes , visiting @entity1 is always a pleasure , which is why it remains the no. 1 tourist destination in @entity37			1
