" the enterprise is estimated to have made $ 175 million , and deprived copyright owners , including @entity52 production houses , of more than $ 500 million in revenue , according to the @entity20 @entity54			1
dotcom maintains @entity38 was merely a file storage site , and the company should not be held responsible for the content users were uploading			1
" i should never have been charged criminally for a civil case			0
the charges are outrageous and wrong			0
the case against me is a contract prosecution for @entity52 , " he told @entity0			0
' @entity52 ' raid in january 2012 , @entity12 police , acting in conjunction with the @entity66 and @entity20 @entity54 , launched a @entity52 - worthy raid on the sprawling property @entity1 was leasing in @entity70 , @entity12			1
according to a @entity12 police statement , officers swooped on " @entity73 " in two marked helicopters , and had to cut their way into a safe room where the multi-millionaire had taken refuge -- a version of events that was later contested in court			2
@entity1 has called the raid " needlessly theatrical " and a further attempt by @entity20 authorities to smear his image			1

" on his @entity116 profile , @entity1 describes himself as an " entrepreneur , innovator , gamer , artist , fighter , father of five			2
" this year he separated from his wife of five years , @entity123 , who was recently photographed in an @entity70 nightclub with prime minister @entity126 's 19 - year - old son , @entity125 she told the @entity127 that the teenager happened to be at the same club			2

can my life get more bizarre ? where 's the guy who says " you 've been punk 'd ? " anti-establishment the 2012 raid on @entity1 's property set off a wave of legal proceedings , pitting the entrepreneur against @entity12 authorities , who had responded to a @entity20 call for help to find the alleged fugitive			1
at issue was the legality of police search warrants and the @entity66 's seizure of electronic information			0
this year , a @entity12 appeals court ruled the raid was legal , however the seizure of electronic data was not			0
months after the raid , an investigation by the inspector - general of intelligence found that the nation 's spy agency -- the @entity162 ( @entity162 ) -- had conducted illegal surveillance on @entity1 before officers moved in			0
at the time of the raid , the @entity162 only had jurisdiction over foreign nationals ; @entity1 was granted residency in 2010 and should have been protected , the prime minister said in a public apology			0
" i apologise to mr @entity1 , i apologise to @entity12 because every @entity173 that sits within the category of having permanent residency or is a @entity12 citizen is entitled to be protected from the law when it comes to the @entity162 , and we failed to provide that appropriate protection for him , " @entity126 said			1

because he 's not a citizen , dotcom ca n't stand as a candidate but he 's put his financial clout -- some $ 4.5 million -- behind what some see as an unlikely coalition in attempt to chip away at @entity126 's political power			0
in an opinion piece for @entity0 , @entity1 said under @entity126 's leadership , the country had " quietly morphed into the political equivalent of an @entity20 slave , responding more readily to the interests that motivate the @entity20 than to the concerns of @entity12			1
