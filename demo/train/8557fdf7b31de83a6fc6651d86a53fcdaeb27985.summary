@entity0 -- think big -- really big -- and you may understand the stakes in an upcoming @entity5 case that could have a profound impact on nearly every @entity8 business with employees			2
at issue is whether the justices should allow certification of the largest class - action employment lawsuit in @entity15 history , a long - standing dispute against mega-corporation @entity17 over alleged gender bias in pay and promotions			1
arguments in the case are tuesday morning and ruling can be expected by late june			2
the company is the world 's largest retailer and the nation 's largest private employer			2
if the class - action goes through , hundreds of thousands of women -- perhaps as many as 1.6 million plaintiffs -- could join in the largest discrimination claim of its kind			1
tens of billions of dollars or more in damages are potentially at stake			0
the high court case is among the biggest of the current term , and could establish binding standards over high - stakes liability involving companies large and small			1
' i 'm a fighter ' a mammoth appeal started small -- six women from @entity45 , unknown to each other at first , but sharing a common story			0
" i 'm a fighter if nothing else , and so are all the other women that are involved , " said @entity48 , one of the original plaintiffs			0
speaking with @entity1 , she recounted why she brought suit against @entity17 in 2001			1
" i was saying i want to do something more , but for whatever reason i kept getting overlooked for team leader positions , " she said			0
" they kept hiring men off the street			0
literally , i do n't even know where they came from , whether they came from college , men who never even had a day 's worth of @entity66 experience were coming in and i was the one training them			0
" @entity48 , 46 , began working at @entity66 retail warehouse -- part of the @entity17 brand -- in 1986 , eventually relocating to a store in @entity71 , @entity45			1
by 2000 she was the longest - tenured hourly employee at the store , but claims she was being paid " virtually the same " as male associates with half her experience			2
she was eventually promoted in 2001 , two weeks after the lawsuit was filed , and remains at the company			0
@entity48 soon realized her experiences were similar to other female workers -- first in the @entity79 , then across the country			0
" they know we 're right and they just do n't want to admit it , " she told @entity1 correspondent @entity81			0
" they never want to admit anything when they 're wrong , they just believe that they 're semi-untouchable because of their size			2
" @entity48 claims she was told by a male general manager " to doll up , " wear more makeup and dress a little better as a new supervisor on the loading dock , comments she says were inappropriate			0
and she says managers frequently yelled at her and other female workers , but not male counterparts			0
the plaintiff 's lawyer @entity99 says there is a " corporate culture " at @entity17 , where female associates are treated as second - class employees , and that the company 's " strong , centralized structure fosters or facilitates gender stereotyping and discrimination , " which trickles down to individual stores			1
" the store managers do n't make up their own pay and promotion policy -- they follow a common set of policies that are established by headquarters in @entity116 , " he said			2
" there is extensive oversight of the decisions they make			2
" spokeswoman says people are held accountable @entity17 operates 4,300 facilities in the @entity15 , with more than $ 400 billion in global sales in 2009			1
it employs 1.4 million people in the @entity15 alone			0
officials boast their anti-discrimination policy has been in place as long as the company has been around , and a recent public relations campaign has been launched to promote its diversity and inclusion			0
@entity133 is an example of what @entity17 says is a person who started small but has risen in the company because of her talents and hard work			1
after beginning as a store management trainee nearly two decades ago in @entity45 , she is now executive vice president for people at @entity17 , responsible for human resources			1
@entity133 is also a spokesperson in corporate efforts to fight these claims of discrimination			2
" from my personal experience , it 's not part of the company 's culture or part of the policies			0
my career growth has been very positive with @entity17			1
i am in a job that i never dreamed that i would be -- it 's based on my ability , my performance , my leadership abilities , but i am just one of many women , " she told @entity1			0
" i 've never been exposed to the examples that have been shared by the plaintiffs			0
i simply have n't seen it and i will tell you that we do n't have a tolerance for that kind of misconduct			2
" @entity133 says every employee from part - time entry level hourly workers to salaried managers must follow the rules			2
" the policies against discrimination are in place for very good reasons ; not only is the law , but is the right thing to do , " she said			2
" there 's oversight at a corporate level to ensure that the policies are in place , that they are relevant to today 's workforce and today 's workforce issues			0
ultimately at store level , that 's where those policies are enforced , and people are held accountable if they violate those policies			0
" @entity17 says case is too big the workers bringing suit say women represent more than 70 % of @entity17 's hourly workforce , but in the past decade made up less than one - third of its store management			1
a federal appeals court had concluded there was enough merit in the claims to proceed to trial on a class - action track			1
since the lawsuit was filed a decade ago , both sides of the dispute have held discovery hearings , where preliminary testimony was taken to establish facts			0
the high court will not judge the merits of the sweeping claims at this stage , just whether a class - action trial can proceed			1
the parties have the option of settling the dispute out of court at some point in the future , and the company may feel great financial pressure to do if they lose at the @entity5 on this gateway issue			2
the company has protested the size of the class action , which it called " historic " in scope , saying it would be onerous , with too many disparate issues , to litigate			1
" the plaintiff 's lawyers in this case went way too far			2
it 's the way the plaintiffs have framed the case , implicating every store , every person			2
there 's no way , one woman can be representative of a million women in a case like this , " said @entity232 , an experienced appellate attorney who will argue the case for @entity17 before the justices			1
" the danger is that it would expose virtually every company in @entity15 to huge , costly , baseless class actions that 's bad for jobs , bad for the economy , and at the end of day it does n't help the people on behalf the case is being brought			1
" the company has the support of the business community , while a variety of civil and gender rights groups and unions back the plaintiffs			0
the @entity256 administration has not weighed in on the case			0
" @entity17 is arguing in effect there is a large - company exception -- that when the company is sufficiently large and the discrimination is sufficiently widespread -- it 's just impractical to have a class action , " said @entity99 , attorney for the plaintiffs			1
" but there is no large - company exception to civil rights claims in this country			0
" declaring class - action status for the lawsuit raises the financial and judicial stakes considerably , since more individual plaintiffs can now join , creating greater potential liability for the company being sued			1
in federal courts , such certification must generally follow well - established principles to ensure a lawsuit would not become so large as to be impracticable , and would allow the parties to fairly represent the common interests of the larger class of plaintiffs			1
@entity17 also has been accused in separate lawsuits of discrimination against @entity8 truck drivers and workers with disabilities			1
in 2001 the company settled 13 lawsuits by paying out $ 6 million			0
most workplace discrimination lawsuits fail to reach a court for resolution , according to data compiled by the federal @entity294			1
in 2003 , when the @entity17 litigation was in its preliminary court stages , about 27,000 sex discrimination claims nationwide were resolved administratively by the @entity294 , little changed from the prior decade			1
more than 57 percent -- some 15,000 claims -- were ruled administratively to have " no reasonable cause " and those usually were dismissed			0
just over 10 percent were judged to have merit , resulting in a total of $ 94.2 million in settlements , or $ 34,200 on average per case , according to the data , which include all such claims , not just those involving @entity17			1
the case is also a clash of dueling cultures -- some have dubbed it the @entity313 vs. @entity314 , for the corporate headquarters and the home to the liberal legal team outside @entity79 where the lawsuits first percolated			0
both sides have lots of data three women now sit on the high court and each brings their own personal and judicial approach to gender bias cases			0
this is particularly true for justice @entity328 , a legal pioneer in promoting equality on the job			0
whether their views will sway their male colleagues is unknown , but the court in the past three decades has restricted when class actions can proceed , saying " rigorous analysis " must first be conducted by the courts			1
this after women , blacks , latinos and the disabled launched high - profile class actions beginning in the 1960s			1
the problem is that both @entity17 and the plaintiffs have presented their own massive sets of data -- statistics and depositions -- that could overwhelm any " rigorous analysis " of the facts			1
the dueling numbers -- which experience shows can often be manipulated in creative ways to make the point -- paint completely different pictures of the level of discrimination			1
both sides agree the case , however it is resolved in the courts , will irrevocably alter the workplace landscape for generations to come			0
the case is @entity366 ( 10 - 277 ) .			1

court to decide only whether case can proceed as class - action suit
it would be the largest discrimination case of its kind
@entity17 argues size would make case onerous
