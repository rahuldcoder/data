-- the world heard of the plight of a @entity5 @entity4 wife and mother who , while eight months pregnant , was arrested and sentenced to public flogging followed by execution			1
her crime ? an @entity11 court in @entity12 found her guilty of apostasy , that is , leaving @entity11 and converting to @entity16			0
it 's a crime punishable by death , according to some interpretations of @entity11 law			1
@entity21 , 27 , who is married to an @entity22 , was released , rearrested , and then released again			0
it 's still uncertain whether her nerve - wracking ordeal is over yet			2
but @entity21 's plight is nothing new or isolated			1
@entity27 , a @entity4 mother of five , has been languishing in prison since 2010 , sentenced to death in @entity30 for " blasphemy			1
" her husband and children went into hiding after death threats			2
7 terrible countries for @entity4 persecution of @entity4 is one of the greatest human rights violations in the world today -- and certainly the one least known in the @entity40			1
religious hostilities are on the rise around the world , against @entity43 , hindus , jews , folk religion followers and more			0
but the situation is so bad for @entity4 that the normally diplomatic @entity48 just asserted : " the persecution of @entity4 today is even greater than in the first centuries of the @entity51 , and there are more christian martyrs today than in that era			1
" to those familiar with the true history of early persecution -- when @entity4 were habitually tortured to death , set on fire , fed to lions and dismembered to cheering audiences -- his statement may seem exaggerated			1
but even today , as in the past , @entity4 are being persecuted for their faith and even tortured and executed			1
in @entity66 , while @entity4 were ushering in the @entity65 , @entity11 terrorists bombed the @entity51 in @entity67 , killing 23 worshipers and injuring about 100 people			1
@entity70 and @entity43 alike protested the bombing			0
since then , dozens of coptic churches have been attacked , some torched to the ground			0
in august 2013 , the @entity75 and its @entity77 allies attacked and destroyed dozens of churches in retaliation for the @entity81 's endorsement of the @entity83 revolution , which was joined by tens of millions of moderate @entity43			0
in 2010 , @entity84 in @entity85 was attacked during @entity86 , with 58 worshipers killed and hundreds wounded			0
lesser known is that , since @entity22 forces ousted @entity92 in 2003 , militants have threatened and attacked @entity4 so often that many have fled the country in fear			1
in @entity98 and @entity99 alone , islamists like @entity97 have been making life a living hell for " unbelievers			0
" in @entity104 , the @entity77 organization @entity103 has in recent years attacked hundreds of churches , reserving the worst attacks on @entity107 and @entity109 church services			0
a january , 2014 , @entity111 study on religious discrimination across the world found that harassment of @entity4 was reported in more countries , 110 , than any other faith			1
@entity117 , a nondenominational christian rights watchdog group , ranked the 50 most dangerous nations for @entity4 in its @entity119			1
the no. 1 ranked nation is @entity122 , then @entity123 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity30 , @entity127 , and @entity128			0
more disturbing is that three of these countries -- @entity99 , @entity124 , and @entity130 -- were " liberated " in part thanks to @entity22 forces , while in the fourth , @entity98 , the @entity22 is actively sponsoring the " rebels , " many of whom are not even @entity98 and some of whom have been responsible for attacks and kidnappings of @entity4			1
it seems that when some @entity141 states fail , hostilities against @entity4 rise			2
of the top 50 nations documented for their persecution of @entity4 , 41 are @entity75 majority or have sizeable @entity75 populations , such as @entity146 and @entity147			1
it 's important to note that @entity11 extremists are the culprits within their borders			0
other countries , especially communist ones like @entity122 , @entity153 , and @entity154 , are intolerant of @entity4 ; churches are banned or forced underground , and in @entity122 , exposed @entity4 can be immediately executed			1
nothing integral to the fabric of these societies makes them intrinsically anti-christian			0
something as simple as overthrowing the @entity122 regime could possibly end persecution there -- just as the fall of communist @entity164 saw religious persecution come to a quick close in nations like @entity169 , which if anything is experiencing a @entity171 revival			2
opinion : @entity4 face abuse around the globe the reason @entity11 radicals persecute @entity4 can be traced to culture and politics , but also to extreme interpretations of @entity11 religious texts that are used to justify that persecution			1
the majority of the world 's @entity43 reject such intolerant readings , but a small minority of @entity11 is enough to terrorize the even smaller number of @entity4 living in @entity75 majority nations			1
one reason @entity190 was not flogged and executed might be that her case became a cause celebre , thanks to the media			0
there is a familiar pattern			0
back in september 2012 , two other @entity4 under arrest and awaiting execution in the @entity11 world were released			2
pastor @entity200 , charged with apostasy and sentenced to death in @entity127 , was eventually released			0
a teenage @entity4 girl known as @entity204 , charged with blasphemy in @entity30 , was freed			2
in each case , freedom came only after widespread international condemnation			0
the world must condemn the persecution of all religions -- all cases must be exposed to the light			2
it 's incumbent on nations to control religious discrimination within their borders			2
and if it 's the regime itself that endorses or inflames religious hostilities , the rest of the world must pay attention and denounce it			2
most important , @entity225 nations must make foreign aid contingent on the rights and freedoms of minorities			0
after all , if we are willing to give billions in foreign aid , often on humanitarian grounds , surely the very least that recipient governments can do is provide humanitarian rights , including religious freedom .			0

@entity237 : sentencing a @entity4 mother to death is nothing new or isolated
@entity237 : more countries persecute @entity4 than any other religious affiliation

@entity237 : cases need to be publicized and condemned , as @entity5 woman 's plight was
