-- over the decades , celebrities have chosen various ways of dealing with an increasingly intrusive media			2
such methods have included suing ( @entity5 ) , punching ( @entity6 ) and putting a bag over one 's head ( @entity10 )			2
but @entity12 's coping mechanism opens a new chapter in the paparazzi wars			1
after celebrity gossip site @entity15 released footage of @entity12 shouting profanity at an aggressive videographer ( with muffled audio that may or may not have contained a gay slur ) , @entity12 published a bitter " goodbye to public life " essay in @entity24			1
before we permanently lose any other celebrities to their secret hideouts , it 's time to consider a way to fight back against the paparazzi			1
in fact , @entity12 was on the cusp of discovering a new weapon â € ” he just did n't realize it			1
upon first reading of @entity12 's tirade , you might have missed the solution ( after all , the piece is rather long and , at times , tiresome )			1
but the answer is staring us in the face			2
in fact , it 's staring all of us in the face			0
these days , @entity12 said , " everyone has a camera in their pocket			1
" not just the @entity52 of the world , but all of the @entity54 looking for a chance to shame a celebrity			0
this kind of world is too much for @entity12 , who is prone to losing his temper			1
but if cameras are small , cheap , and ubiquitous , why not use it to your advantage ? why not take one with you when you go in public , thus ensuring the public can always see your side of the story ? " they are baiting you , " @entity12 said in his farewell - to - the - world			2
" you can tell they want to get into it with you			0
some bump into me or block the entrance to my apartment ... " exactly			0
so why not catch them in the act ? does that sound like too much trouble ? maybe so			0
but if you 're rich like @entity12 , why not hire someone to follow you around and record life as it happens ? go about your daily life , but have a trusted and well - paid photographer at your side , documenting just how rude , invasive , and aggressive the celebrity chasers can be			1
still sound unreasonable ? there 's yet another solution that just made itself available			0
you can record your daily interactions with a wearable camera embedded in your glasses			0
if you want to show the world what really happened with that jerk of a photographer , just upload the footage from your @entity99			1
as @entity101 reported earlier this month , police departments are outfitting their officers with wearable cameras to protect both police and citizens against unfair accusations			0
all of this might sound extreme			0
why should celebrities have to go to such lengths to protect themselves ? it may be a lot of trouble , but is n't it better than being humiliated repeatedly by out - of - context outbursts ? is n't it better than retiring from a job you love and living as a hermit for the rest of your life ? @entity12 said in his diatribe , " you 're out there in a world where if you do make a mistake , it echoes in a digital canyon forever			1
" true , but not if you can show your side of the story			0
it may be too late for @entity12 , but not for other celebrities			1
do n't disappear from public life just to spite the paparazzi			2
if you do , the celebrity gossip sites will win			0
it 's time for a 21st century solution			0
it 's time to fight photos with photos			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity144 .			2

@entity12 published an essay saying he wants to leave @entity147
@entity149 : @entity12 should consider how to fight back against the paparazzi
he says instead of retreating , @entity12 should get a photographer or @entity99
@entity144 : by recording his life , celebrities can fight photos with photos
