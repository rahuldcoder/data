-- @entity1 begins a new chapter in @entity3 monday -- just as the @entity5 economy also enters a new phase			1
five years since @entity7 collapsed , @entity5 is a different place			1
back then , in 2008 , investors endured " @entity12 " and the @entity13 made a record points loss , down 778 at the close in one day			0
economic growth went into reverse , and by the end of that year jobs were disappearing at the rate of 700,000 every month			0
read more : @entity7 bankruptcy fees hit $ 2.2 billion now , the markets keep on hitting record highs , to the point where it 's almost routine			2
month by month , the economy is slowly gaining jobs			2
the vital signs appear to be stronger ; the patient 's illness is in remission			1
and the @entity30 is about to start withdrawing the treatment			2
quantitative easing was first used as shock therapy in 2008 , and investors are still attached to the money drip at the rate of $ 85 billion a month			2
many analysts expect @entity38 to start cutting down the flow in the coming days			0
but as he " tapers " the treatment , another great tide of fortune is rising -- that of @entity5 oil			1
domestic crude production has been increasing since 2008 , reversing a decline which began in 1986			0
now , given the right conditions , the @entity5 could even become a net oil exporter , according to the @entity5 @entity50			1
five years ago , that would have seemed an impossible dream			0
and it is all because of the controversial new technique of fracking			2
@entity0 explains : what is fracking ? across the country , fracking is re-making boom towns , where income is high and jobs are plentiful			0
on next week 's @entity1 , some of those working in this new oil industry describe it as a " wonderful revolution " and " @entity5 capitalism at its best			1
" but as @entity7 proved , @entity5 capitalism is not always kind			1
the industry is building on fractured or " fracked " ground , and what goes boom can surely go bust too			0
@entity74 traveled to @entity75 , @entity76 , where he met some of the new generation of oilmen extracting crude from solid rock			0
state governor @entity82 told him that the success of shale oil and gas is a product of free spirit and innovation , raising the @entity5 economy out of its miasma			1
and that it is here to stay			0
hard knocks , seismic shocks and intense pressure may have made the @entity5 economy hurt ; these days a similar process is also helping to make it strong			1
at least for now .			0

@entity1 is *relaunching* , as @entity5 economy also enters a new phase
five years after @entity7 collapsed , the economy 's vital signs are starting to *improve*
the @entity30 's shock treatment is going to be withdrawn -- but the @entity5 may find boost elsewhere
the @entity5 could become a net exporter of oil , in part because of fracking technique
