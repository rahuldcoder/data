@entity1 , @entity0 -- a prominent @entity4 human rights lawyer was under @entity6 diplomatic protection friday after @entity0 authorities released him from a detention center for illegal immigrants			1
@entity10 had barely made it to his hotel in @entity1 before diplomatic officials rushed to the scene and announced he was not safe			1
they swept him away in a car for his safety			0
" after six days [ in detention ] , i 'm so tired i just want to go to my hotel and take a shower , " @entity10 said to @entity2			2
" i feel like i 'm still in detention			0
" he has had to make difficult , life - altering decisions in recent weeks			0
the lawyer has been a longtime defender of @entity4 juveniles facing the death penalty			1
more recently , he campaigned to attract international attention to the case of @entity26 , the 43 - year - old mother of two who was sentenced to death by stoning after she was convicted of adultery			2
on july 24 , as activists around the world staged protests against @entity26 's death sentence , @entity10 was taken in by @entity4 authorities for hours of interrogation			1
after they released him , he said , he went into hiding			0
around the same time , he said , @entity4 security forces detained his wife and brother - in - law			1
the brother - in - law has been released , but @entity10 said his wife @entity42 is still being held in solitary confinement without charge			1
" i am extremely worried about my wife and her safety , " @entity10 said in an earlier interview with @entity2			1
" they [ the @entity4 authorities ] told me if you do n't turn yourself in , we will not let your family go , " @entity10 added			1
" i made a decision , after i saw that they were still going to arrest me and mistreat me , that i must leave @entity4			2
it was a very hard decision			0
" he added , " the truth is even when someone talks about @entity57 and says her name , it 's really hard for me to talk and i want to cry when that happens			0
" like many other @entity4 dissidents , @entity10 slipped across the border from @entity4 to the eastern @entity0 border town of @entity64			1

i went to the police officers inside the airport and declared myself as a refugee , " he said on friday			0
