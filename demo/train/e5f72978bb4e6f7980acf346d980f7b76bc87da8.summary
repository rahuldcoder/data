-- " one of the biggest things that i suffered with initially was sickness , especially on the ovals , getting dizzy ... you get out of the car after 10 , 15 , maybe 20 laps and you could n't walk straight			0
i found it very difficult			0
" of all the sensations you 'd want to feel when driving a car at over 200 mph in front of thousands of spectators , and with the rest of the grid bearing down on your rear wing , it 's fair to assume dizziness is not one of them			2
even if you 're @entity21 , one of the most successful drivers in motorsport history , and especially not when -- like the @entity26 star did when he switched to indycar racing in 1993 -- you 're plunged into a completely alien environment			1
for the @entity36 , a rookie acclimatizing to the pressures of racing in one of @entity35 's most popular track events , it was the kind of experience where you crave a supportive word or two from a veteran of the scene			1
@entity21 recalls : " @entity44 was very funny , he said : ' you 're in a foreign country , boy , do n't turn right -- you 'll eat concrete			2
' and i thought , ' what ? thanks ! ' @entity44 was really fun , lots of very useful tips ... " @entity44 , in 1977 , became the first driver to win the @entity49 500 four times , and ran his own team after retiring -- but the @entity51 could n't match @entity21 's unique feat. only four men have managed to win titles in both @entity55 and @entity26 , such is the challenge posed by the jump between the two disciplines			1
only one has reigned as champion in both at the same time			2
despite his dizziness , @entity21 pulled off a remarkable achievement			1
driving the all - conquering @entity62 , he was crowned world champion for the first and only time in 1992 , having been runner - up the year before -- after coming agonizingly close to the title in 1986 and ' 87			1
however , his glorious 13th season in @entity26 ended in his retirement following a dispute with @entity69 , and he headed across the @entity70 in search of a new challenge			2
@entity21 accepted an offer by the @entity75 team to drive in the @entity77 series			1
his aggressive driving style , plus the steely resolve forged by his earlier @entity26 setbacks , helped him take @entity35 by storm			1
after notching up five wins he took the title and , for three precious weeks , held two of world motorsport 's most coveted prizes			2
" winning the @entity55 championship was something incredibly special , it helped to convert the @entity35 , " the 60 - year - old told @entity0 's @entity88 ahead of this weekend 's @entity35 @entity89			1
" i remember , i think it was an @entity93 television broadcast in @entity94 the first year i was there , they were really knocking me on television saying , ' has anyone told this rookie he ca n't overtake on the outside ? ' " and then just as the commentator said it , the other commentator said : ' well , he 's just done it so i guess no - one 's told him ! " @entity21 , talking at his new museum on the island of @entity106 , which sits in the @entity107 , has fond memories of his time across the @entity70 -- which was followed by a brief return to @entity26 with @entity111 and a similarly unsuccessful stint in touring cars			1
" there were 90,000 fans wishing me happy birthday for my 40th birthday on the race track in @entity119 , " he said			0
" we converted a lot of people who would n't believe in grand prix drivers in @entity35 , and i had a blast and it was fantastic			1
we 've got so many good friends over there , and i think all the sponsors , everybody who looked after us over there , were such great people			0
" @entity21 , who will be one of the race stewards on sunday in @entity132 , believes no current @entity26 driver " is crazy enough " to attempt the switch to @entity55			1
he feels many of them have their talents masked by the technical and tactical nature of the current @entity26 setup , which has been dominated for the past four years by @entity141			2
" this is the misunderstanding now , because with the tires they have underneath them , they 're not able to ' gorilla ' the tires			0
and now this is a misconception of @entity141 and @entity152 , " said the former @entity150 driver			0
" @entity141 is able to set his car in a very , very neutral way and he looks after his tires better than any other car			0
predominantly , that 's because ... he 's a class act			0
he 's four - time world champion , i mean , that 's an amazing feat ! " high praise from a man who sold his house to get his first drive , suffered chemical burns in his first race for @entity168 and broke his neck and vertebrae in his back in pursuit of his sole @entity26 title			1
" life and death was almost , well , certainly a monthly thing			0
back in the 1960s and ' 70s , when we started , and then obviously late ' 70s and early ' 80s and all through ' 80s and early ' 90s , people regularly got seriously hurt and unfortunately died too			0
so , it was part of the scene			0
" what 's amazing for me -- if you look at the footage even in the 1990s -- the drivers get out the car half dead , wringing wet , completely expelled of all energy			2
at @entity191 this year , you saw them get out of the car and you think they 've just come from the hairdressers ! " times may have changed but experience like that of @entity21 's is seen as a valuable commodity by teams such as @entity201 , which benefits from the wisdom of three - time world champion @entity203 -- who is non-executive chairman of the @entity205 marque			1
" i do n't think anybody can afford me , that 's the problem , " @entity21 replied when asked if he could play a similar role			1
however , his desire to race still burns strongly			0
" as you get old , your body tells you that you ca n't be there anymore			0
although i have to say , with the @entity152 and the @entity213 @entity89 this year , i did put my hat in the ring for the drive , " @entity21 revealed			1
" there 'd be certain races i 'd definitely be very competitive to win			0
for a bit of fun i said , ' please consider me			0
i 'm not over the hill yet , ' but i did n't get the call back ! "			0

@entity21 is the only driver to hold @entity26 and @entity55 titles at the same time
he pulled off the feat in 1993 after *quitting* @entity26 to drive in the @entity35
the 60 - year - old will be a race steward at this weekend 's @entity35 @entity89
he says modern @entity26 drivers are not " crazy enough " to try @entity35 cars
