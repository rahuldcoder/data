the future of @entity4 's planet - hunting kepler space observatory was in question wednesday after a part that helps aim the spacecraft stopped working , the @entity1 space agency said			1
controllers found tuesday that @entity9 had gone into a " safe mode " and one of the reaction wheels needed to orient the spacecraft would not spin , associate @entity4 administrator @entity14 told reporters			2
@entity4 engineers are trying to figure out whether they can get the balky part back into service or whether they can resume control by another method , @entity14 said			1
" we 're not ready to call the mission over , " he said			1
but at roughly 40 million miles from @entity25 , " @entity9 is not in a place where i can go up and rescue it			0
" another @entity25 called a certainty the @entity9 mission has identified 132 planets beyond our solar system since its launch in 2009 , leading scientists to believe that most stars in our galaxy have planets circling them			1
it has gone into a " safe mode " with its solar panels facing back at the sun , giving controllers intermittent communication with the craft as it spins			2
three new planets could host life the probe was built with four reaction wheels and needs three of them -- one for each axis -- to aim its telescope precisely at a distant star , deputy project manager @entity45 said			1
one failed in july 2012 , leaving it with only two functioning wheels at this time , @entity45 said			2
@entity9 shut itself down after it was pointing in the wrong direction , @entity45 said			0
he said it was " reasonable to suspect " the failure of the reaction wheel was the cause , but scientists had n't confirmed that			0
more news about @entity9 the $ 600 million mission was designed to operate for three and a half to six years			0
even if controllers are unable to return it to service , @entity4 said the mission has produced enough data to keep scientists busy for up to two years			1
" another four years would have been frosting on the cake , but we have a nice cake now , " said @entity69 , the project 's principal scientist			0

the kepler space observatory has identified 132 new planets
a control wheel has stopped responding , leaving the craft unable to aim precisely at stars
" we 're not ready to call the mission over , " @entity4 *official* says
