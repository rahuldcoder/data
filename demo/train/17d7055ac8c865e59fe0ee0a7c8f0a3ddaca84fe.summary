it is impossible to ignore the impact of @entity2 , a modern - day pope who operates with humility and directness , who lives simply , who prefers to spend his time with the poor and the marginalized , and who sees his role as pastor , compassionate friend and fellow sinner on the @entity15 journey			1
the photos of @entity2 embracing a man disfigured by neurofibromatosis and the scene of the little boy on the stage in @entity22 as @entity2 addressed pilgrims tell us all we need to know about the humanity and accessibility of our new pope			1
some bishops are desperately trying to reassure their followers that nothing is changing			0
but that 's a tough sell when the head of the @entity33 tells his bishops that they are obsessed with abortion , contraception and same - sex marriage and when he says he does n't judge gays and lesbians			2
but is this change simply one of tone ? @entity2 ' comments on the appointment of bishops suggest that his criteria has less to do with loyalty and orthodoxy and more to do with pastoral experience and compassion			1
but in his first @entity52 appointment , one that was not in the pipeline before his papal election , he named bishop @entity56 as the new archbishop of @entity58 , @entity59			1
@entity56 is a true believer culture warrior and former @entity62 official who led the charge against the @entity65 last year and earlier joined in the condemnation of @entity67 for having president @entity68 as a speaker			0
and in light of @entity2 closing the door on female priests , many women theologians and lay leaders are wondering about his emphasis on a new role for women in the church			1
@entity79 , a @entity80 trained theologian and a writer for @entity82 , suggests that we should not get too excited			0
for her , the bottom line is that in spite of the warmth and sincerity of the @entity27 's words , he is not indicating any change in church teaching			0
she points out that the @entity27 says that the church does not want to wound gays and lesbians , but " @entity2 does n't seem to understand that it is precisely the teaching of the church that is doing the wounding			1
" and @entity111 asks the broader question : " what good is a more pastoral church when ultimately , gays and lesbians are still told their relationships are sinful , women are still barred from answering @entity103 's call to ordained ministry , @entity106 - @entity52 women and men routinely affected by @entity108 can not get access to condoms , women in need of lifesaving abortions are forced to die , and starving families in countries like the @entity119 are denied access to condoms ? " @entity111 has a point			1
it 's possible that the most that @entity2 ' words will accomplish will be to neutralize those bishops who lean whichever way the papal wind blows			2
worse , the pope 's comments will provide protective cover for the more outspoken orthodox bishops			0
they might tone down their comments , but they will not change their attitudes or their policies			0
cardinal @entity137 of @entity138 may praise @entity2 , but this is the man who has compared same - sex marriage to incest and declared that gays and lesbians " do n't have the right stuff			1
" and @entity146 archbishop @entity145 , the @entity52 church 's cheerleader against same - sex marriage , has n't let @entity2 ' softer tone slow down his continued negative crusade			1
@entity145 and others like him are young enough to wait out @entity2 , organize before the next papal conclave and put a true believer back in place			2
pope @entity2 may be a bridge builder , but for now , no bridge is long enough to span the dichotomy between the church 's expression of love for gays and lesbians and the simultaneous condemnation of them when they act consistent with their nature			1
i 'm a 73 - year - old , white , heterosexual male and have not been on the receiving end of the ignorance , hate and narrow orthodoxy that religious belief can still stir up			0
but @entity79 and her partner have been			0
my son and his partner have been			0
and thousands like them , all made in the image and likeness of @entity103 , have been on the receiving end of hate and ignorance , and in the context of our church , the maddening , wounding , mixed message of love and condemnation			2
until there is an openness to new interpretations of @entity193 regarding homosexuality , until the new thinking on natural law is accepted that sexual orientation is not a choice but part of the nature of the person and until the growing number of moral theologians who offer compelling arguments that sexual acts should be seen in terms of harm or good to individuals rather than in terms of offending @entity103 , there is no lasting change and the wounds remain open			0
and our new pope , unintentionally , may seduce many into thinking that things are getting better and provide cover for the @entity214 of our church to continue their campaign of condemnation and exclusion			2
on the other hand , i 've learned from my own recent life experiences that @entity103 's grace can mysteriously arise out of excruciating pain , so i do n't give up hope			0
nor would i want to underestimate the potential grace of a modern - day pope who prioritizes @entity228 ' message of love and inclusiveness over doctrine and orthodoxy			1
join us @entity234 / @entity233 .			0

@entity236 : the photos of @entity2 show his humanity , compassion , accessibility
@entity236 : but church doctrine *unchanged* ; @entity2 named a *conservative* archbishop
@entity236 : being gay or lesbian is still a sin , women ca n't be priests , condoms are *banned*
still , a pope who believes in love and inclusiveness can do much good , he says
