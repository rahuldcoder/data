-- since 2005 , @entity1 has been serving up free pasta dinners to children , many of whom are poor and live in motels with their families			1
@entity1 is an @entity8 chef and the founder of @entity10 , a nonprofit that provides dinner seven days a week to more than 300 children at the @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15			1
@entity0 asked @entity1 for his thoughts on being chosen as one of the top 10 @entity18 of 2011			1
@entity0 : where were you when you got the call that you 'd been selected as a top 10 @entity18 ? @entity1 : i was home , getting ready to go to work after talking to my mom in @entity26 over @entity27			1
i ca n't express the feelings i had at that moment			0
i wanted to scream like @entity31 ! it was amazing news			0
@entity0 : what do you hope this recognition will mean to @entity10 ? @entity1 : this gives me hope that i can make @entity10 a leader in resolving children 's hunger in @entity42			2
i do believe that , all together , we can make a big difference			1
if restaurants and chefs across @entity42 worked with their local @entity47 and followed our program , we could feed millions of children			1
i feel like i 'm a voice on this @entity50 and my mission is to tell people : " let 's step forward			0
do n't just talk about it			0
" we can make this a better place to be and fight the poverty in our country			2
@entity0 : how will you use the $ 50,000 award that you receive for being selected as a top 10 @entity18 ? @entity1 : it will help me to keep doing what i do and serve more children in need			1
i also hope to travel to promote the program and make more people aware of our national " motel kids " problem			0
@entity0 : what do you want people to know most about your work ? @entity1 : in @entity42 , in our own backyards , we have kids who go to bed hungry			2
if we do something about it , we will have no hungry children in @entity42			0
if you give up one cup of coffee a day , you can feed 10 kids			2
one bag of pasta costs a few dollars , and that can serve 10 kids			0
if i can feed more than 300 kids alone , all together we can feed millions			1
