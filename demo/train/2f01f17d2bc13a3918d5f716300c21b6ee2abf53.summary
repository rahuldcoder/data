-- @entity2 's police are facing tough questions over their response to last friday 's terror attacks , in which 76 people died			1
first , @entity7 was rocked by a huge blast outside government buildings , which left eight people dead			1
less than two hours later , a gunman reached @entity12 island , some 20 miles away , and proceeded to fire on the mostly teenage participants of a political summer camp for well over an hour			1
reporters , particularly from the foreign press , have asked why it took an hour from the police first being alerted for armed officers to arrest the suspect , 32 - year - old @entity21			1
among their questions have been why a helicopter was not used to take elite officers to the scene , rather than them travelling by road , and whether problems with a police boat -- which meant civilian vessels had to be commandeered -- delayed the response			1
some have also asked whether the response to the bombing in the @entity2 capital took priority over the @entity12 alert , with emergency phone operators and resources already tied up as frantic calls started to come in from young people under fire on the island			1
@entity43 , chief of police for the @entity45 district , which covers @entity12 , told reporters wednesday that her officers and members of an elite police unit had done their best to get to the island quickly			1
" i do n't think we had any chance to be there faster than we made it , " she said			2
responding to the situation in @entity12 was " the highest priority " for local police , and was not affected by events in @entity7 , she said			1
her staff had done a " very demanding job " both during and after the event , she added			0
at the same press conference , @entity62 , who was a commander on the scene , described how he grabbed his equipment and raced to the embarkation point for @entity12 when the alarm was raised			2
a problem with the engine of the police boat meant the 10 or so emergency personnel who had met there had to take two privately owned motor boats instead , he said			2
however , these made the 700 - meter crossing of the deep @entity77 lake faster than the police boat would have done , he said			2
as they approached , the police heard " a lot of shooting " from the southern part of the wooded island , with gunshots " coming fast and thick , " @entity62 said			2
officers ran toward the shooting and were about 350 meters away , in very difficult terrain , when they started to shout to the suspect , he said			0
suddenly they saw him in front of them with his hands above his head and his weapons -- a rifle and an automatic pistol -- on the ground			0
the gunman was arrested by one officer as the others sought to find out of whether he was working alone and started to give first aid to a " conveyor belt " of the injured , @entity62 said			0
he spoke of his pride in the way police and local citizens rallied to help the injured			2
@entity107 said an evaluation of the police response would be carried out later this year			1
a day earlier , police spokesman @entity110 rejected criticism of the police response to the massacre in @entity12			1
" i do n't think this could have gone faster , " he said			0
" i do n't see how that would be possible with the distance and with these conditions			0
we always try to be better but i do n't see how we could have done this faster			0
" he said the police had only one helicopter , which is kept at @entity123 north of @entity7 , and that it would not have been suitable to transport a team of counter-terror officers from the capital to the scene			1
" it took time to get the staff in			0
it was filled with irrelevant equipment for the purpose and has never been used for such operations , " he said of the helicopter			0
" i am of the opinion it would not have been any quicker to use it			0
" the former police inspector for @entity7 , @entity138 , told @entity2 reporters he felt it was a pity the helicopter was on the ground on the day of the attack			1
@entity143 , of @entity144 -- which pays for the national police helicopter service from its budget -- acknowledged it was flying less hours than it used to because of budget constraints			2
prime minister @entity149 announced an independent commission of inquiry wednesday , which he said would take an exhaustive look at what had happened and report back within a year on what lessons could be learned			0
but he rejected the suggestion that his country was naive and unready for potential attacks , saying @entity2 's security forces were aware of the danger of violent attacks and were prepared for them			0
@entity0 's @entity162 contributed to this report .			0
