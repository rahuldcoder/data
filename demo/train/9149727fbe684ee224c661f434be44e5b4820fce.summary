-- hackers who commandeer your computer are bad enough			0
now scientists worry that someday , they 'll try to take over your brain			1
scientists can use brain signals to control computers -- hands free			1
in the past year , researchers have developed technology that makes it possible to use thoughts to operate a computer , maneuver a wheelchair or even use @entity17 -- all without lifting a finger			1
but as neural devices become more complicated , and go wireless , some scientists say the risks of " brain hacking " should be taken seriously			1
" neural devices are innovating at an extremely rapid rate and hold tremendous promise for the future , " said computer security expert @entity24 of the @entity26			1
" but if we do n't start paying attention to security , we 're worried that we might find ourselves in five or 10 years saying we 've made a big mistake			1
" hackers tap into personal computers all the time			1
but what would happen if they focused their nefarious energy on neural devices , such as the deep - brain stimulators used to treat @entity41 's and depression , or electrode systems for controlling prosthetic limbs ? according to @entity24 and his colleagues , who published their concerns july 1 in @entity48 , most devices carry few security risks			1
but as neural engineering becomes more complex and more widespread , the potential for security breaches will mushroom			1
" it 's very hard to design complex systems that do n't have bugs , " @entity24 said			0
" as these medical devices start to become more and more complicated , it gets easier and easier for people to overlook a bug that could become a very serious risk			1
it might border on science fiction today , but so did going to the moon 50 years ago			0
" some might question why anyone would want to hack into someone else 's brain , but the researchers say there 's a precedent for using computers to cause neurological harm			1
in november 2007 and march 2008 , malicious programmers vandalized epilepsy support web sites by putting up flashing animations , which caused seizures in some photo - sensitive patients			0
" it happened on two separate occasions , " said computer science graduate student @entity77 , a co-author on the paper			0
" it 's evidence that people will be malicious and try to compromise peoples ' health using computers , especially if neural devices become more widespread			1
" in some cases , patients might even want to hack into their own neural device			0
unlike devices to control prosthetic limbs , which still use wires , many deep brain stimulators already rely on wireless signals			1
@entity96 into these devices could enable patients to " self - prescribe " elevated moods or pain relief by increasing the activity of the brain 's reward centers			2
despite the risks , @entity24 said , most new devices are n't created with security in mind			1
neural engineers carefully consider the safety and reliability of new equipment , and neuroethicists focus on whether a new device fits ethical guidelines			0
but until now , few groups have considered how neural devices might be hijacked to perform unintended actions			0
this is the first time an academic paper has addressed the topic of " neurosecurity , " a term the group coined to describe their field			0
" the security and privacy issues somehow seem to slip by , " @entity24 said			2
" i would not be surprised if most people working in this space have never thought about security			2
" @entity130 , a bioengineer who studies brain - machine interfaces at @entity132 , said he was initially skeptical of the research			2
" when i first picked up the paper , i do n't know if i agreed that it was an issue			0
but the paper gives a very compelling argument that this is important , and that this is the time to have neural engineers collaborate with security developers			2
" it 's never too early to start thinking about security issues , said neural engineer @entity142 of the @entity143 , who was not involved in the research			2
but he stressed that the kinds of devices available today are not susceptible to attack , and that fear of future risks should n't impede progress in the field			2
" these kinds of security issues have to proceed in lockstep with the technology , " @entity142 said			1
history provides plenty of examples of why it 's important to think about security before it becomes a problem , @entity24 said			2
perhaps the best example is the internet , which was originally conceived as a research project and did n't take security into account			0
" because the @entity164 was not originally designed with security in mind , " the researchers wrote , " it is incredibly challenging -- if not impossible -- to retrofit the existing internet infrastructure to meet all of today 's security goals			0
" @entity24 and his colleagues hope to avoid such problems in the neural device world , by getting the community to discuss potential security problems before they become a reality			0
" the first thing is to ask ourselves is , ' could there be a security and privacy problem ? ' " @entity24 said			0
" asking ' is there a problem ? ' gets you 90 percent there , and that 's the most important thing			0

scientists can use thoughts to operate computers , wheelchairs and @entity17
as tech develops , risk of " brain hacking " become more real , scientists say
*neurosurgical* @entity48 *article* says risks are slim now
but security " should proceed in lockstep with the technology , " expert says
