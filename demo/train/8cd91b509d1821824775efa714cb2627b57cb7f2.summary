@entity0 -- the federal government will recognize gay marriages in @entity5 that occurred between recent conflicting court rulings , attorney general @entity2 announced friday			1
@entity2 's statement said couples married on march 22 , before an appellate court blocked a previous ruling allowing gay marriage in @entity5 , " will be eligible for all relevant federal benefits on the same terms as other same - sex marriages			1
" his decision is the latest move by the @entity18 administration toward legalizing gay marriage in the @entity20			0
the divisive issue pits social and religious conservatives against liberals and moderates , with polls showing a majority of @entity20 in support of gay marriage			0
on march 21 , @entity20 district judge @entity29 struck down @entity5 's gay marriage ban as unconstitutional			2
his ruling cleared the way for same - sex couples to marry immediately , and scores did the next day until the 6th @entity20 @entity35 issued an order to temporarily stay , or put on hold , @entity29 's decision			2
the same appeals court extended its stay on tuesday , causing confusion over the status of the couples married over the previous weekend			0
@entity2 noted that @entity5 gov. @entity50 " has made clear that the marriages that took place on saturday were lawful and valid when entered into , although @entity5 will not extend state rights and benefits tied to these marriages pending further legal proceedings			2
" " for purposes of federal law ... these @entity5 couples will not be asked to wait for further resolution in the courts before they may seek federal benefits to which they are entitled , " @entity2 said , citing a previous decision in a similar situation in @entity53			1
voters in @entity53 , @entity5 and nine other states passed constitutional amendments in 2004 defining marriage as one man and one woman			0
@entity29 's ruling was the latest in a series of recent similar decisions affecting marriage restrictions in states including @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74			0
in most of those cases , the judicial orders did not take effect immediately			0
however , @entity5 's did and , as in @entity53 , same - sex couples immediately got marriage licenses before later court decisions halted such unions -- at least for now , as higher courts weigh in			1
last june , the @entity83 issued a landmark decision that rejected parts of the @entity86 while ruling same - sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits .			1

after a court ruling , scores of same - sex marriages occurred in @entity5
attorney general @entity2 says those couples are eligible for federal benefits
the issue is now in limbo *due* to a legal appeal
