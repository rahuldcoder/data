-- music conductor @entity1 loves the sound of fighter jets			2
rushing to the window of her office at the @entity6 , where she directs the choral studies program , she saw the @entity9 in the air practicing for an upcoming show			2
searching online later for more about their aircraft , she learned that @entity14 was inviting @entity16 users to apply to attend a ceremony marking the delivery of the last @entity19 to the @entity20			1
@entity21 had only been tweeting for about a year when her application was accepted to the @entity14 " @entity23 , " which brought @entity16 users together in may to tour the @entity25 facility , meet and greet @entity19 pilots , have free lunch and @entity23 about the experience			1
" i really felt connected to my father by going to this @entity20 ceremony , " said @entity21 , who traces her love of flying to her late father , who was a bomber pilot in @entity31 " i 'm sitting on a plane and we take off -- and i know the science of flying -- but i still think ' how is this possible ? ' " said @entity21 , who also blogged about the experience			1
" humanity has always looked toward the sky , and that 's very human nature to look up			2
" aviation enthusiasts like @entity21 are n't interested in your complaints about airline security or packed planes or high prices			1
to them , the thrill of flight has never gone away , and modern airline technology and design are more fascinating than ever			1
one big change : no longer satisfied with simple snapshots of the newest @entity56 for their photo albums or attending air shows or collectors ' conventions , these enthusiasts are sharing their journeys online as they try to see and fly the newest airplanes , catch a glimpse of the latest in fighter plane technology or collect the most arcane aviation industry books or snacks			1
( use the hashtag # avgeeks to find their postings online			2
) sites range from one - man shops to businesses with paid staff and advertising			2
" while air travel has become a chore for a lot of people , thanks mostly to the security hassles and airline fees , the fact that you can board a plane , get some sleep and wake up two continents away â € ” for a reasonably affordable price â € ” can all be traced back to the incredible underlying technology that allows an aircraft to run safely and efficiently for 14 - 20 hours a day , day in and day out , " said @entity88 , editor of @entity89 , an aviation website			1
airplane boneyard : aviation geek lists 5 places worth a visit " the mind - boggling logistics of running an airline -- from scheduling all the pilots and flight attendants to getting catering trucks where they need to be to cleaning the lavatories -- are also pretty amazing to me , " said @entity88 , who grew up in @entity95 , @entity96 , obsessed with the airline traffic taking off and landing at nearby @entity100 and @entity101 airports			1
some sites like @entity89 aim to be the news source for aviation worldwide			1
@entity113 's @entity112 reports every aviation incident and accident that he can track			1
@entity117 's blog reports everything he can capture on video or via camera coming in and out of @entity122 's @entity121			2

the place where dead airplanes come back to life have you seen the @entity56 ? for some aviation enthusiasts , catching a glimpse of the newest planes , documenting their finds and sharing their photographs is what brings them joy			1
a top catch these days is the @entity56 , which @entity146 photographed during @entity122 's " @entity149 " stop in @entity148 last month			2
" anything about aviation is exciting but the one thing that is really appealing is that change is the only constant , " wrote @entity146 , community manager of @entity150 , via e-mail from his home in @entity148			1
( @entity150 hosts an active aviation community and includes a renowned collection of aviation photography			1
) " no matter what sector , there is always change and no matter what flight it is always different from the previous one			1
i can also go to the airport to photograph and be assured there will always be something different			2
" still , access to a less - exciting @entity170 can still delight enthusiasts in the right context			1
@entity88 , the @entity89 editor , flew on a new @entity174 - 800 from the @entity122 factory in @entity176 to its new home in @entity178			0
" in the @entity180 there are hundreds of 737s flying around and the average citizen does n't blink an eye when @entity180 or @entity184 receives a new one , " said @entity88			1
" but in @entity178 there was practically a national celebration when we arrived to welcome their first factory - new aircraft			0
" do you want a pool table or a trip to @entity195 ? architect @entity196 credits his parents for choosing travel to @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 and other foreign destinations over material things throughout his childhood , instilling a love that has endured			0
case in point : he remembers asking his mother for a pool table in third grade			0
" do you want a pool table or a trip to @entity195 ? " she replied			0

now he designs actual airports as associate director of @entity223 , including @entity225 's international terminal			0
but he 's still a superfan , happily collecting aviation industry books in many languages wherever he travels around the world and attending collectors ' conferences when he can			1
writer @entity232 has loved traveling since he demanded the window seat on a flight to @entity235 -- at age 3			1
he also has a drawer filled with old timetables , and more recently , printed menus from his travels around the world as an author of @entity244 travel guidebooks			0
" at age 6 my favorite place in the world was o'hare airport where we would change planes , " he said			0
" i was a little terror with my family , ordering them from , say gate @entity254 to @entity255 to make our connections and checking the black and white monitors all the way to make certain nothing had changed			0
" despite the hassles of modern - day travel , " i still get a thrill when we surge down the runway to takeoff , " said @entity260			1
" i like anything that includes a feeling of movement			0
i 'm a big fan of turbulence			0
( it ) makes you feel like you 're going somewhere			0
" companies join the conversation an aviation company can no longer roll a plane out of the factory or take it on a test flight in the middle of the night and not expect to be tracked by aviation enthusiasts			1
people are going to find out through @entity281 , @entity117 's blog or elsewhere			0
" why should n't we start the conversation and make people feel like they 're part of something ? " asked @entity122 spokesman @entity283			0
" we 're self - proclaimed aviation geeks , too			1
" @entity122 hosts " @entity288 " which follows the world travels of a top @entity122 marketing vp			0

( the company now has four @entity16 handles : @ boeingairplanes , @ boeingdefense , @ boeingcareers and @ boeing			1
) it 's the worldwide tour of the @entity56 that attracted thousands of new of aviation lovers to @entity122 's @entity16 handles , according to @entity283			1
" we said when it was coming , when it was going , what it was doing while it was there , " he said			0
" even when events were not open to the public , we were able to give behind scenes images and take you there			0
" perhaps one of aviation 's more devoted bloggers is @entity117 , who spends nearly 16 hours of almost every day outside @entity121 , the airport outside the @entity122 factory in @entity316 , @entity176			2
he records everything that comes out of the @entity122 factory , gets video and pictures , and listens to radio traffic			0
a couple days ago , he said he rented a helicopter to get shots from the air of the airplanes below			0
