but referee @entity44 awarded the goal to spark frantic protests from incensed @entity4 players			2

" @entity1 responded with a superb third goal by @entity65 before fellow midfielder @entity66 put the outcome beyond doubt with a long - range free - kick which wrong - footed @entity70 in the @entity4 goal			1
@entity72 scored the fifth as a dispirited @entity4 continued to make defensive errors , putting @entity1 into the final against @entity76 next month and boosting the team ahead of wednesday 's @entity28 semifinal first leg against @entity79			1
@entity76 beat archrivals @entity80 2 - 1 in saturday 's semifinal at @entity7			1

meanwhile in the @entity96 , @entity95 's double hopes were ended by a 2 - 1 defeat to @entity98			2
the winner from @entity98 also proved controversial with @entity95 manager @entity100 confronting referee @entity101 at the end of the match			0
with the scores 1 - 1 , @entity101 awarded @entity98 a penalty when a @entity106 shot struck @entity107 on the arm			2
