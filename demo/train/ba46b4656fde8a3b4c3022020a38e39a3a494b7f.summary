-- the @entity2 siege in @entity3 has claimed the lives of more than 60 people including the @entity3 president 's nephew , at least one @entity9 diplomat and @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity14 nationals			1
@entity16 's affiliate in @entity17 , @entity18 , has claimed responsibility for the siege and it has been reported that a number of the militants involved in the attack may have been foreign jihadists from @entity25 nations			1

most notably , it commended the @entity53 brothers , the alleged @entity55 bombers as well as @entity56 , the young girl from @entity57 , east who attempted to murder her local parliamentary representative			0
however , @entity37 fought in the @entity60 jihad against the @entity61 that originally gave rise to @entity16 as well as in other conflicts in @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67			1
watch : did @entity16 magazine inspire @entity69 ? in reality , the numbers of @entity37 abandoning their lives in the @entity11 or the @entity10 to go and join @entity18 in @entity17 is very small			1
in order to best analyze this phenomenon , they should be separated into three distinct groups : converts to @entity77 , @entity37 , such as @entity78 -- a @entity79 believed to have been killed in @entity17 -- and members of the @entity17 diaspora in @entity25 countries			1

failures of moderate @entity90 communities to welcome converts due to ethnic or regional differences or to answer the political or theological questions that many new converts have often led to their adoption by radical groups such as @entity97 and its offshoots , that invariably have links to @entity101 groups present in hot conflicts			0
under these radical wings , new converts to @entity77 are taught a highly politicized version of @entity77 that invariably focuses on current conflicts around the world , spun with an @entity101 narrative that exaggerates the importance and benefits of violent jihad , the need for action against oppressors , or the moral degradation of @entity30 and their societies			0
read more : group hails @entity118 ' these recruits are considered perfect for @entity16 's future goals as , due to the fact that they are often not targeted for racial profiling and have greater access in their home countries , they can pass between borders relatively risk - free			2
with an estimated 40,000 @entity30 currently living in @entity3 , many more visiting as tourists each year , and an area of limited policing on the @entity17 - @entity3 border , @entity25 members of @entity18 constitute a potentially large threat to the country 's security			1
however , @entity17 is not a particularly attractive destination for @entity25 jihadists			1
when assessed in terms of cohesion and integration , @entity18 is one of the weakest @entity16 regional affiliates			1
due to existing tribal hierarchies and fault lines , @entity18 has significant infighting and is renowned for not being accepting of foreigners			2
western @entity90 minorities , predominately from @entity150 and @entity151 backgrounds , therefore face similar issues to white converts when it comes to joining the jihad in @entity17			0
the recent killing of @entity157 and @entity158 ( @entity159 ) , who had purportedly fallen out with @entity18 's leadership reveals the extent to the lack of cohesion in the group			2
read more : @entity10 jihadi reportedly killed in @entity17 however , for @entity101 groups such as @entity168 and @entity97 , this conflict is a well - established part of the radicalizing narrative , in much the same way that @entity60 , @entity64 and @entity66 have been , and will continue to attract @entity172 with jihadist aspirations			0
in reality , @entity18 are fighting a more nationalist struggle , clothing it in pseudo-religious garments and will continue to fail to engage significant numbers of @entity30			2
the @entity17 expatriate community numbers more than 100,000 in the @entity11 , 78 % of whom reside in @entity181 , according to the @entity182			0
the @entity183 estimates more than 20,000 @entity17 reside in the @entity184 and about 89,000 in the @entity10 according to @entity9 's @entity185 , more than 44,000 @entity17 live within its borders			0
this is the most likely group of @entity25 muslims to be making trips to @entity17 , and , if @entity172 , are those most likely to be accepted by @entity18			1
as communities that are often criticized for their lack of integration within @entity25 societies and with some radical community leaders among them , members going to fight in @entity17 has long been a concern for @entity25 security services			2
of greater immediate concern , however , is the @entity17 diaspora in @entity3 , whom the @entity3 authorities will undoubtedly target in the coming weeks			0
@entity18 has shown itself to be exceptionally capable , both operationally and in terms of its use of secrecy , and increasingly extreme			0
according to our sources , while previously with limited operations outside of @entity17 , @entity18 conducted the preparation for these attacks months ago and had considerable surveillance in the shopping mall , and is likely delivering retribution against @entity3 for its aggressive pursuit of @entity18 in recent years			1
in whichever way the @entity25 contribution to @entity18 will be depicted by the group for propaganda purposes , its lack of cohesion will continue to curb its effectiveness			2
the radicalization of @entity30 is a significant problem that must be addressed in the @entity11 and jihadist tourism is an issue in which security services are rightfully investing considerable resources ; @entity17 is simply the latest destination and not a particularly fashionable one			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity231 .			0
