@entity0 -- the @entity2 has announced that we have reached the one millionth @entity5 child refugee mark			1
it is a terrifying statistic if you really digest it and do n't just read it as a sanitized account of a tragic war			1
i 've been working with @entity11 responding to the @entity5 refugee crisis for over a year and have met hundreds of refugees , many of them children			1
recently i was at one of our activity centers in @entity18 , @entity0 , where we work with traumatized children			1
most of the kids were participating in the organized games and activities , but on the sidelines i saw a little boy sitting alone and staring at nothing			1
i approached him to see if he was ok , but he did n't look at me			1
as i came closer i saw his hair had patches of grey at the temples			1
he was frail and his brows furrowed with worry			1
he was clearly a boy , but looked very old			2
he told me his name was @entity34			2
when i first asked him to tell me what had happened in @entity5 he did n't answer me			1
he just looked away and pretended not to hear			2
his eyes were dark and unreadable			2
he seemed to be holding terrible secrets inside			2
i tried another tack and asked him if he had any brothers or sisters			2
@entity34 replied that he had six siblings			2
after some coaxing , @entity34 opened up and told me a little more			2
he was 12 years old and lived in @entity43 , @entity5 , before he came to @entity0 with his family six months ago			1
in @entity5 , @entity34 lived in a home on a large plot of land			1
he spent his days at school with his friends , and then came home and took care of his lambs			2
he was raising six lambs and caring for them was his favorite part of the day			2
the family home in @entity43 was near a weapons factory that was under the control of the government forces			2
for the first two years of the conflict , there was n't any significant fighting in the area , so the family had n't made plans to leave			2
but six months ago , the @entity66 ( @entity66 ) began an attack to try to take over the weapons factory			2
without any warning , the family found themselves in the middle of a war zone			0
@entity34 recalled how the bombs started falling near their house and the ground shook under his feet			0
he remembered his mother screaming and his sisters crying			0
finally his parents told the children that they had to leave immediately			1
@entity34 tried to go out to the field to gather his lambs , but his father forbade him			0
at this point , @entity34 stopped speaking			0
he sat silently , holding back a flood of tears			0
his elder sister , @entity89 , joined us and helped to complete his story			0
the family started to run from the house , toward the village			0
she pulled @entity34 away from the house as they fled			1
every time she let go of his hand , he kept trying to run to get his lambs , even as the bombs were coming closer and closer			0
the family managed to flee the village and spent two days on a cramped bus to reach @entity0			1
they had to cross many checkpoints along the route			0
some were run by government troops , others by rebel militias or @entity66			0
at each checkpoint the bus would stop and men with guns would force some of the passengers to get off the bus , and then the bus would go on without them			0
@entity89 did n't remember anyone speaking during the long trip			0
it was as if everyone was holding their breath , but at night she could hear people crying in the dark			0
the family arrived in @entity18 with only the clothes they were wearing			0
they did n't have any friends or relatives in @entity0 and there are no official refugee camps , so they rented part of a house to live in			1
the family of nine members is crowded into two rooms that serve as their kitchen , living area , bathroom and sleeping quarters			0
during the winter it was cold and damp and the roof leaked			0
now , in the blazing summer heat , the small space is like an oven			0
since arriving in @entity0 , @entity34 and his siblings have not attended school			1
like most refugee kids , they face language barriers as @entity5 children are educated in @entity154 , while in @entity0 education is provided primarily in @entity156 or @entity157			1
the school is overcrowded and they do n't have money for buses and school supplies			0
@entity34 spends most of his days helping his parents			0
he misses his lambs and says he is lonely and has n't made any friends yet			0
@entity34 is not an isolated case			0
@entity11 has conducted regular assessments of the psychosocial health of refugee children in @entity0 and found that more than 55 % of the youth assessed experience constant fear that something bad will happen and are unable to express their feelings about the conflict			1
almost half ( 46 % ) feel disconnected from others and have trouble making friends , and more than two - thirds ( 70 % ) have trouble sleeping or wet the bed			0
as the number of refugees forced to flee @entity5 's civil war continues to grow rapidly , one number stays the same -- more than half of them are children			1
every day , thousands more are ripped from their homes and schools , left with painful memories of violence and confusion over what they 've lost			1
many of them live in constant fear and uncertainty and have lost hope for the future			1
@entity11 has been focused on protecting these youngest refugees since the start of the crisis			1
we created safe spaces and developed constructive activities where they can heal from trauma , build friendships and develop critical life skills			0
we are helping meet their families ' basic needs , while continually finding new ways to ensure their emotional health and development are not forgotten			0
the reality is that we do n't know when this crisis will end			1
but when it does , these children will be the ones left to rebuild their lives and their country			1
today , was @entity34 's first time attending a @entity11 youth program			1
he started the day out alone on the margins of the activities			0
but after some counseling and a lot of encouragement from our staff , he joined the other children			1
i watched him throughout the day and saw him start to relax , make friends and even laugh a few times			0
and as he was leaving , he promised me he 'd be back for the next session			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity242			1

thousands of @entity5 have fled into *neighboring* @entity0 where they face *hardship*
@entity11 aid worker @entity242 says many of the refugee children live in constant fear
when the crisis ends these children will be the ones left to rebuild their lives and their country , says @entity254
