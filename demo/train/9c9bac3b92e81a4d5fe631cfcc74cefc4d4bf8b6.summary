-- instead of rah , rah , rah , some @entity2 schools are saying no , no , no -- to cheerleader skirts they say are too revealing for the classroom			1

school leaders say the uniforms just are n't appropriate for classrooms and do n't fit into student dress codes			1
sophomore @entity16 has been cheering since middle school , and she scored a spot on the @entity20 cheerleading team this year			0
