-- @entity2 's career revolves around experimentation			1
as a software engineer , he 's always trying out different approaches to get the best outcomes and running tests to confirm hypotheses			1
last year , he decided to optimize the operation of a different kind of machinery : his own body			1
@entity2 , 37 , is about to become a father for the third time , and he wants to be around for grandchildren further down the line			1
that 's partly why he decided last year to get his weight , and health in general , under control			1
in september 2012 , the 5 - foot - 11 @entity22 - born man weighed 300 pounds			1
today , he 's 185 pounds			1
he did n't follow any one pre-established regimen to get there			2
a variety of books and lectures taught him about possible methods , and he tried different approaches until he found what worked for him			1
what he did specifically is n't necessarily the best method for everyone			2
" try to set up an experiment where you give yourself some time , and kind of hold yourself to it , " he advises			2
" if you screw up one day , that 's in the past			2
just pick yourself up and try again			2
" sitting , the @entity41 way growing up in @entity42 , @entity2 was very active			1
he played soccer and cricket in his youth			2
but when he went to college at the @entity47 , he got hooked on computers			2
he rebuilt the university 's student registration system and worked for a start - up company while still in school			2
the price of technology was slothfulness			2
" i started to move a lot less , and sit at a computer a lot more , and just ate crap all day long , " he said			2
" it kind of escalated from there			2
" without fully realizing it , his diet turned to virtually all carbohydrates ; he never ate vegetables			1
at the start - up company , he helped rig the soda machine so @entity67 would pour out even more concentrated			2
being overweight seemed to bring down his immunity			2
when he 'd get a cough , it would n't go away for months			2
over time , his weight ebbed and flowed			0
he got a little healthier while working in @entity74 , @entity75			1
he lost a significant amount of weight when he and his wife moved to @entity42 , because he walked around the city and ate better			1
but when they relocated back to the @entity41 , moving several more times , @entity2 's weight swung upward again			1
@entity2 boasts that he has lived in every time zone in the continental @entity41 -- and most of them helped him gain weight			1
@entity87 1 : diet family members had been bugging @entity2 for a long time about getting healthy			1
his father , a personal trainer and gym owner , was always in the back of @entity2 's mind			1
but it was @entity96 , author of " why we get fat , " who ultimately inspired him			0
@entity96 taught @entity2 that not all calories are alike -- it matters what you eat -- and that carbohydrates in particular are bad because they stimulate insulin , a hormone that increases fat storage			1
controversy still surrounds the idea that a low - carb diet is healthier than a high - carb one ( @entity112 ' famous diet , for instance , is still hotly contested ) , but @entity2 decided to try it			1
@entity2 cut way back on his carbohydrates , then started adding some foods back into the diet to see how he did			1
he stayed away from processed foods			0
he also started paying more attention to his body 's signals , only eating when he was hungry			0
another technique he found useful at the beginning of this journey was taking a photo of food that he was about to consume , making him feel more " in the moment " during the act of eating			0
in conducting his personal experiments , @entity2 did n't want to start with more than one variable at a time , so he did n't add in exercise until he felt he had a good handle on diet			1
with diet changes alone , he lost 20 pounds in two weeks			1
he created a mobile web app called 16:8 to track the time between his meals , because he had read about the idea of intermittent fasting			0
he would simply hit a button when he started and stopped eating , so he could monitor how energetic he felt in connection with how much time had passed since eating			0
for instance , he has discovered that he feels great when he runs in the morning even if he 's been fasting since the night before			1
@entity87 : exercise when he felt his diet was under control , @entity2 decided to try running , which he had never enjoyed			1
the first time , he could barely get to the end of the block			0
he paced himself by taking long walks , then got into a routine of " run , walk , run			0
" the key here was to commit ahead of time to running every single day , and letting that habit form , he says			0
he did n't have to make a decision every day about whether to exercise -- he had already made that choice			1
soon he was able to run three miles at a time			0
at first , he would listen to podcasts while running			0
but reading a book about meditative running -- " running with the @entity163 " by @entity164 -- changed his mindset			0
when he challenged himself to run without technology , he ran at least eight miles , and felt better than during any other run			0
he also got into meditation itself , which he found even harder than exercise because of the need to stay focused			1
although exercise has brought him noticeable physical and mental health benefits , he calculates that from a pure weight loss perspective , 80 % of his loss has been due to his food intake			1
what he eats today , @entity2 continues to focus on minimizing carbohydrates and sugars , focusing instead on protein and vegetables			1
typically , for breakfast , he 'll have a veggie bacon omelet , with water to drink			0
lunch could be a salad with meat on top , or even a burger without the bun			0
dinner might be quinoa with chicken , with more salad			0
almonds make a good snack			0
he 'll have a cup or two of coffee in the morning to help boost his metabolism and take some of the hunger away			0
sticking to his diet is n't always easy			2
he remembers breaking down at a child 's birthday party and eating more cake			0
the family still often eats pizza on friday nights , but these days @entity2 only has one slice instead of four			1
he 's also determined that having a " cheat day " is n't as effective as he thought ; at first he enjoyed being able to indulge on his cheat day			0
but the day after would always be full of cravings			0
now he keeps his " cheat " treats small , such as dark chocolate			0
how it feels living with 115 pounds less than last year , @entity2 says he has much more energy throughout the day			1
he used to be a night owl ; now he does n't even need an alarm to wake up in the morning			0
the tiredness he used to feel after lunch is gone			0
his lung and skin problems have cleared up			0
and his mood is " much more positive			0
" weight loss has provided him with tangible evidence that he was able to make modifications to better himself , boosting his self confidence			0
it makes him think , " huh , i actually made a change , and it 's actually working			0
what else do i want to do with my life ? " he 's intent on staying healthy , not just for himself , but for his family			0
he wants to live long for them as a good role model			0
" i can tell my kid a million times , eat your broccoli , " he said			0
" but if i 'm there eating a pizza , it 's just not going to work			0
" @entity2 was brought to tears when , about eight months ago , his eldest son was at a friend 's house and told his hosts he did n't want soda			1
he asked for water instead , " because that 's what @entity250 drinks , " @entity2 recalls			1
" this is having a bigger effect than anything else that i can be doing , " @entity2 said			1
" what are the things i can model , especially as a father , to a son ? and it keeps kind of escalating from there			0
" when old photos of @entity2 show up on the family 's digital photo stream , his 4 - year - old son @entity263 will shout " there 's @entity268 ! " or even , " i never got to meet @entity268			1
" the truth is , of course , @entity263 did meet @entity2 when he was " @entity268			1
" he just does n't remember when his father looked like that , only a year ago			2
the weight has been stored on the hard drive of the past			0
