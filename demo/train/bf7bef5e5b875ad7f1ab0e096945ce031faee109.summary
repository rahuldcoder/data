-- in more than eight @entity4 years , @entity3 's unexpectedly tough @entity2 rover opportunity has been stuck in a sand dune , nursed a bad shoulder and endured five brutal winters on @entity2			1
its new rover , @entity9 , should be so lucky			1
scientists at the space agency 's @entity11 in @entity13 planned for @entity14 to last for 90 days on @entity2 after its landing in 2004			1
instead , it 's now run for more than 3,000 martian days and traversed 22 miles of the planet 's surface -- scoured by sandstorms and working through temperatures that range from 86 degrees to 112 degrees below zero @entity23 ( 30 to -80 c )			1
" the rovers were designed to last in extreme conditions , and we 've taken great care in how to operate them , " said @entity11 roboticist @entity25 , one of @entity14 's former operators			1
" someday , some essential part will go that stops it			0
it 's going to happen			0
but we try our best to push that as far as out as we can			0
" even after all these years , " you still see a lot of excitement " at @entity14 's control center at @entity11 , " @entity25 said			2
@entity3 spent $ 800 million to launch opportunity and its sister rover , @entity42			1
the twin craft lifted off from @entity44 in june 2003 aboard separate @entity46 rockets and landed successfully the following january , bouncing onto the surface inside a cocoon of air bags			2
the roughly 5 - foot - long , 380 - pound rovers were loaded with a variety of cameras and instruments used to analyze martian rocks and soil , and their findings have helped convince @entity3 that @entity2 once had water on its surface			1
' @entity59 ' @entity2 landing coming @entity3 lost contact with @entity42 in 2010 and wrote off the rover in may 2011 , but @entity14 kept on going			1
among its findings was a vein of the mineral gypsum -- an indication that water once ran across the surface of the @entity2			1
and it beamed back its 100,000th picture , a sweeping panorama of the martian surface , in early july			0
not that it 's been unscathed			0
it 's got a worn " shoulder " joint on its robotic arm , making some operations difficult			0
it was stuck in a sand dune for nearly two months in mid- 2005			0
but it has had unexpected luck , as well			0
" the solar panels were expected to collect a lot of dust , and they did , " @entity25 said			0
" but we 've had winds that have cleaned the solar panels occasionally , and that has given it a new lease on life			2
" @entity25 is now working on the much - larger curiosity			2
designers built the 2,000 - pound craft with lessons from @entity96 in mind , including a longer , more advanced robot arm , a hammer drill that can crack apart rocks and a laser that reduces rock to a hot plasma , allowing an on - board spectrograph to determine its composition			1
opportunity 's neighborhood is known as the @entity108 , a sandy desert located a few degrees south and west of the martian equator and its prime meridian			2
the site is nearly halfway around the planet from @entity42 's location , and from where @entity9 is expected to touch down at 1:31 a.m. monday @entity117 it can run more than 100 meters ( 325 feet ) in a day , but it 's not exactly a speed demon : opportunity tops out at about 2 inches a second			2
but it 's also capable of climbing up to 30 - degree slopes			2
building an out - of - this - world menu for @entity2 @entity25 says the goal for operators is " pushing the limits and keeping it safe			1
" " the fact that the rovers have lasted also has to do with how carefully you operate them , " she said			0
the average distance between the @entity4 and @entity2 is about 225 million miles , but it varies widely during the year as both planets orbit the sun. when they 're the farthest apart -- about 400 million miles -- a radio signal from @entity3 takes more than half an hour to reach the rovers			1
that means controllers have to pre-program @entity14 's daily movements , working from a three - dimensional model of the surrounding terrain , @entity25 said			0
@entity11 transmits the plan to the rover , which carries out the program and beams the data back to @entity4 via two satellites now circling the @entity2 , the @entity148 and @entity149			1
that means the programs have to be completed by the time those satellites are in range , adding one more wrinkle to controllers ' calculations			0
" imagine planning your drive from your home to your office , " she said			0
" even though you know that route truly well and there 's no traffic , imagine having to pre-think all those options			0
then imagine it 's raining			0
" complete coverage on the @entity2 landing			1

the @entity2 rover opportunity has survived eight and a half years on @entity2
the 5 - foot craft was designed to last 90 days
" we 've taken great care " in operating it , former driver says
