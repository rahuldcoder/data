-- getting anyone in @entity2 to weigh in on where to find the best shawarma or falafel is asking for trouble			1
the country 's most popular pastimes are , without question , eating and debating , so expect a heated argument , especially since @entity2 is jammed with incredible restaurants , street - food stalls and bakeries			1
besides eating and talking about food , the @entity2 also love to feed their guests , so meals with friends and family can go on for hours and include dozens of different dishes			2
any visitor with a big appetite , a little patience , and an adventurous spirit is bound to eat more and better in @entity2 than virtually anywhere else in the world			2
i 'm @entity2 , although living in @entity27 these days			2
two summers ago i moved back to @entity29 for a year and wrote my memoir , " @entity31 : a @entity32 in @entity29			2
" although i 'd spent my childhood in @entity29 during the @entity2 civil war of 1975 to 1990 , i 'd been exposed to only a fraction of the country 's mind - boggling variety of food			1
so on my recent return to @entity2 , i made a point to go on food adventures across the country , from the cedar - covered mountains in the north down to the ancient city of @entity47 in the south			0
for travelers to @entity2 who want to get a deeper sense of the country 's food culture beyond the well - known staples of hummus , tabbouleh and kebabs , @entity29 is an excellent place to start			1

just about every @entity2 restaurant in @entity29 serves a different dish of the day at lunchtime , usually something deliciously humble that reminds many patrons of their mother 's cooking			1
recurring hits include kibbeh — a national specialty made with lamb , bulgur wheat , onions and pine - nuts baked into a savory pie or into meatballs soaked in minty yogurt sauce — or any of a variety of slow - cooked stews known as yakhnes , served over vermicelli - laced rice with garlicky bits of lamb and braised vegetables topped with homemade yogurt			1
lunch also often includes vibrant salads made with local greens like purslane , and savory pastries stuffed with spiced chard and sweet onions			0
in @entity29 , some excellent places to sample dishes like these and many more are @entity108 — a downtown favorite — and @entity110 , an innovative restaurant in the hopping @entity113 neighborhood			0
after eating around @entity29 for a few days , it would be a shame not to take a least a daytrip or two outside the city			0
@entity2 is relatively small , so getting up to the northern tip of the country or all the way down south takes only about two hours , barring horrendous traffic			0
in northern @entity2 , in the town of @entity124 near the famous cedar tree forests , the local specialty is kibbeh mishwiyeh : fresh minced lamb rolled up with bulgur wheat to form giant meatballs the size of tennis balls , stuffed with caramelized onions and pine nuts and grilled until crunchy on the outside			1

with any travel to towns near the border with @entity157 , like @entity142 , it 's important for travelers to be aware of the changing and potentially volatile situation			1
along the @entity162 coast south of @entity142 is the seafood - centric town of @entity164			2
local restaurants such as @entity166 serve bizrieh — tiny fish , fried and piled in huge mounds on platters for guests to eat by hand , and topped only with squirts of fresh lemon			1
@entity164 also specializes in a wonderful style of kibbeh balls , made with fish instead of meat			0
classic local cafes like @entity180 serve @entity164 's renowned sweet - and - tart lemonade , made from the local citrus harvest and served ice - cold			2
just 45 minutes from @entity29 is @entity183 , a historic coastal city with stunning ancient @entity186 ruins and a well - preserved @entity187			0
but among the archeological attractions it would be a shame to miss out on a platter of fresh local @entity193 fish at @entity195 restaurant			0
fried , drizzled with lemon , and served with crunchy pita bread coated in olive oil , it goes perfectly with a crisp @entity2 beer			0
@entity202 , in the @entity201 , is the agricultural heart of @entity2 , and a road - trip there from @entity29 leads past the town of @entity206 , where farms produce some of the @entity209 's most sought - after dairy products			1
pick up a labneh ( strained yogurt ) sandwich drizzled with mint and sea salt and rolled into soft , papery khibz markouk bread			0
about an hour south of @entity29 is @entity47 , a coastal city dating back to @entity218			0
here fishermen take boats out from the ancient harbor and return with fish to deliver to local restaurants			0
the best ones , like @entity225 , turn the day 's catch — such as luqqos , a mild white fleshy @entity162 fish — into simple but exquisitely fresh preparations			1

on a lucky day , the main course might be m'loukhiyeh , a fragrant , soupy stew made from mallow leaves topped with tender spiced chicken and served over rice , with a tangy vinegar and onion dressing			0
in homes , as at restaurants , the meal will likely start with a mezze — a spread of dishes that usually includes hummus , fattoush ( tomato , mint and bread salad ) , babaghanoush , labneh , and more — but it 's important to leave room for the main course			2
then again , i 've never managed to take my own advice , especially since the most intent @entity2 hosts wo n't let guests leave the table without tasting everything in sight and having seconds			0
advice ? just surrender .			0
