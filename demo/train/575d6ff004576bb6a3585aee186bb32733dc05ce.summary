a @entity1 court has ruled that the @entity3 and @entity4 must pay more than $ 650 million to @entity1 citizens and their loved ones for attacks in @entity8 in the early 2000s			1
this week 's decision , issued from the @entity10 in southern @entity11 , could mean millions of dollars each to 40 people or their estates			0
such a ruling may also open the door to similar lawsuits against foreign governments for their part in terrorism , like one against @entity21 's government tied to the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks			2
that said , the decision is n't final			0
and even if it does hold up , there 's no guarantee the @entity3 and @entity4 will pay up			1
both groups are " deeply disappointed " by monday 's ruling , which @entity3 spokesman @entity30 said stemmed from " baseless " charges and " ignored the legal precedent set time and again by other @entity1 courts ... that established @entity1 courts are not the proper jurisdiction for such a hearing			1
" @entity30 expressed confidence that the @entity4 and @entity3 will prevail in @entity1 courts during its coming appeal			1
@entity3 leaders are combating " extremism and violence and maintain a strong commitment to nonviolent resistance and international legal , political and moral redress , " the spokesman added , claiming that this case does n't help in this regard			2
" this case is just the latest attempt by hardline anti-peace factions in @entity8 to use and abuse the @entity1 legal system to advance their narrow political agenda , " @entity30 said			1
" the decision is a tragic disservice to the millions of @entity57 who have invested in the democratic process and the rule of law in order to seek justice and redress their grievances , and to the international community which has invested so much in financial and political capital in a two - state solution			0
" the @entity1 case dates back to the @entity69 , or armed uprising , in which @entity57 staged a series of deadly attacks inside @entity8			1
according to figures from @entity8 's internal security agency , known as the @entity75 , some 488 @entity8 died in suicide attacks between 2001 and 2004			2
@entity1 got caught up in some of those attacks , including the dozens listed in the @entity1 court case			1
a few were killed , more were burned or wounded by gunshots or shrapnel , while others suffered " severe emotional , mental and economic harm , " according to a related complaint			0
one such @entity1 was @entity86			2
on 9/11 , the lawyer from @entity11 escaped the @entity88 before its twin towers collapsed			0
then , four months later , he was walking through @entity90 when a bomb went off , killing one man and wounding more than 110 people			0
@entity86 afterward told @entity2 that he suffered mostly superficial injuries , though his wife 's condition was " a little bit more serious			0
" " i feel very fortunate that someone , @entity98 , is looking over us to make sure that we 're ok , " he said then			0
that and other attacks occurred when @entity103 led the @entity3 and as @entity8 authorities clamped down on him and his allies			1
the violence abated when then - pa prime minister @entity107 began to take over -- a move that became complete with @entity103 's death in 2004			0
@entity107 , who has preached nonviolence even as issues with @entity8 have persisted , has been president now for a decade			2
the @entity1 case was tried in @entity11 because the @entity4 has an office in @entity11 , which is home of the @entity114			1
even if it did not appeal , the @entity3 would appear hard - pressed to pay damages to the plaintiffs			1
@entity8 has played a part in those issues , like its decision to freeze the transfer of more than $ 127 million in tax revenues collected on behalf of the @entity57 in the wake of their bid to join the @entity125 , according to @entity8 's @entity127 newspaper			1
yet this week 's decisions is n't just about the @entity57			0
@entity129 , a lawyer for 9/11 families suing @entity21 and others , thinks it may help in his clients ' case as well			0
" if you cut off the funding , you cut off the terror , " @entity129 said			0
" and @entity1 courts are showing that they can handle transnational terror litigation and make powerful individuals , institutions and governments who have materially supported terrorists ' pay			2

@entity3 , @entity4 are ordered to pay over $ 650 million to dozens of @entity1
the decision is connected to attacks inside @entity8 in the early 2000s
official : *palestinians* will appeal the ruling , which he says stems from " baseless " charges
