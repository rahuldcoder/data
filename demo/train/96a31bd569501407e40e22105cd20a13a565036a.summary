editor 's note : @entity2 is associate professor of history at @entity4 and author of the forthcoming " @entity6 : @entity7 and the @entity8			1
" he blogs at http://americanexception.com / @entity2 says @entity7 's @entity9 has been remarkably silent on same - sex marriage			1
( @entity11 ) -- last week gov. @entity12 signed a bill making @entity15 the sixth state to legalize same - sex marriage			1
it was a paradoxical moment			0
the new law is a reminder that same - sex marriage is the civil rights issue of our era and just how far the movement for marriage equality has come			1
it also highlighted the unexpected and remarkable silence from the @entity9 on this issue			2
during the campaign , @entity7 assured gays and lesbians that he supported repealing " do n't ask , do n't tell " as well as adoption and anti-discrimination rights for the gay community			2
those kinds of promises carry a particular weight when made by a man whose very capacity to run for elected office is the yield of another civil rights struggle			1
that lineage and the high expectations that come with it gave @entity7 an amazing degree of latitude , allowing him , for instance , to remain relatively unscathed even when he placed the rev. @entity50 on the @entity52 program			2
but to date he has taken no significant action on this front and , more critically , his administration is actually being outpaced by state legislatures around the country			2
granted @entity7 has been in office for just 4Â½ months , but given the developments in @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity15 , they have been among the most significant months in the struggle for marriage equality			2
the administration likely wishes to avoid the culture war debacle of @entity68 's early presidency			0
but gay rights are a national issue in a way they were n't in 1993			0
thus the clouds of disappointment we already see gathering			0
we long ago overdosed on comparisons of @entity7 and previous presidents , but it 's hard to miss the way his administration had begun to echo that of @entity81			1
and not in a good way			0
during the 1960 campaign , @entity81 ran as a forward - looking @entity84 who understood the necessity of civil rights			1
he promised an executive order banning housing discrimination			0
gestures like his phone call to a pregnant @entity91 while her husband languished in an @entity95 jail and @entity97 's judicial arm - twisting to secure his release endeared the young candidate to millions of african - americans			0
but once in office , @entity81 made civil rights a low priority			1
by 1962 , @entity104 was openly critical of @entity81 and bitterly observed that the movement activists had become " pawns in a white man 's game			0
" it is worth recalling that the 1963 march on @entity110 was organized not only to ensure passage of a civil rights bill , but also to ensure that @entity81 would not cave to @entity114 on the issue			1
in retrospect , @entity81 's reputation as a supporter of civil rights was greatly exaggerated			1
on one occasion , @entity121 mayor @entity120 invoked @entity81 's name -- without his knowledge or approval -- as the reason local politicians were " forced " to release @entity104 from prison			2
the plan was to direct the anger of @entity132 whites at @entity81 rather than the local officeholders who wanted @entity91 out of jail , but one side - effect was to raise @entity81 's standing among black voters			1
in reality , though , as both candidate and president , @entity81 was consistently behind the curve of history			0
it is far too early to make such assessments of president @entity7 , but there is a disturbing parallel			0
he has carefully outlined support for civil unions and his opposition to a constitutional amendment banning same - sex marriage			1
but as a former law professor , @entity7 certainly knows -- and the language of the recent @entity62 ruling makes frighteningly clear -- the logic of civil unions is essentially the logic of " separate but equal			0
" ( try reading the @entity62 decision and the @entity158 opinion consecutively			0
) ireport.com : share your thoughts on same - sex marriage on the surface , civil unions are a politically safe middle ground , an attempt to highlight the artificial divide between secular unions and the religious rite of marriage			1
but the fact is that marriage is a civil institution just as much as it is a religious one , and therefore religious objections to same - sex marriage should n't be an obstacle			1
we allow atheists to marry and we do not refer to a wedding performed by a secular judge or justice of the peace as a " civil union			0
" the president would do well to define this moment by taking immediate action to repeal " do n't ask , do n't tell " or ensure adoption rights for homosexual , bisexual and transgender families			0
@entity81 believed that promoting civil rights would jeopardize other aspects of his domestic agenda during a national crisis			1
@entity7 has a broader set of crises to resolve than any president in modern history , but that is not a rationale for inaction on this issue			0
ultimately , the gay rights movement will have to learn something that the civil rights movement learned again and again during the 20th century -- it is often necessary to force the hand of even your allies to achieve your goals			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0
