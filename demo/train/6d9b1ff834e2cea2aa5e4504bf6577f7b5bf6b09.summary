it is estimated that around one in four couples around the world have trouble conceiving			0
for a small proportion of them , @entity4 ( @entity4 ) is a technology that can restore the dream of parenthood			1
@entity4 is the fertilization of an egg by sperm outside the body , where it is cultivated in a lab environment , and if an embryo results it is implanted into the mother 's womb			1
now the chances of @entity4 treatment being successful are being boosted by a machine called the @entity22			1
a record number of babies are being born through @entity4 -- with over 60,000 @entity4 babies born in the @entity26 alone in 2012			2
but since the inception of @entity4 in the 1970s , monitoring embryos has been a difficulty			1
in order to examine them , the embryologist must remove them from the safe environment of the incubator and expose them to environmental hazards such as temperature changes and contaminants			0
embryos are removed and examined just once a day , which limits the information available to embryologists , as well as the chances of picking the embryo with the best chance of delivering a viable pregnancy			1
embryo development but these longstanding issues are being addressed by the @entity22			1
the device combines an incubator that maintains perfect conditions , with a tiny camera that takes photos every 10 - 15 minutes -- creating a time - lapse video of the embryo 's development			1
this removes the need to expose the embryo to the outside atmosphere , and provides embryologists with far greater information with which to make decisions			0
" i think this is the most exciting breakthrough since @entity4 started , " says dr. @entity65 , managing director of the @entity67 's @entity66 , responsible for the first @entity22 baby born in the @entity67 , in 2012 ( as well as the first ever @entity4 baby back in 1978 )			1
" the information that we are gathering with the @entity22 with the time - lapse is far superior , " he says			1
" we have much , much more information on which to base the crucial decision as to which embryo is the one to transfer back to the patient			0
" embryos that show early abnormalities can be immediately ruled out , and learning algorithms have been created that recognize positive or negative patterns at key development points thereafter -- meaning patients can be implanted with embryos that have an optimal chance of success			2
" we have a predictive scale ( for evaluating ) the likelihood of an embryo to give the best chance of a live birth , " says @entity65			0
" it 's a complex procedure and it uses very complex technology and some mathematics			0
but using this whole process , it really changes the way the embryologists work in the lab. and i think it 's changing the face of how we do @entity4 , in fact			0
" improving the odds the extra information is particularly beneficial for patients with the lowest chances of pregnancy -- such as older women , or those with reduced egg counts			0
@entity66 estimates its use of the @entity22 and algorithms broadly increases the chance of a pregnancy by around 20 %			0
" the images also allow you a higher level of assurance to pick an embryo with the highest chance of being genetically normal , " says dr. @entity118 , lab director at the @entity119 , in @entity120			0
the technology can also provide insights into early - stage development beyond the need to conceive			2
a recent @entity132 study conducted with an @entity22 showed differences in growth patterns between male and female embryos , which could potentially allow gender to be more rapidly determined			2
use of the @entity22 has spread to @entity4 facilities around the world , but some barriers remain : the vast amount of extra data requires greater resources for analysis , and the technology itself is expensive			1
but much of @entity4 is about trying to beat the odds , and as technology progresses , so do the chances of parenthood for couples who ca n't conceive naturally .			2

@entity22 gives time - lapse images of @entity4 embryos
it gives valuable insight into embryo development
the most viable embryos can be chosen for implantation
the technology is improving @entity4 success rates
