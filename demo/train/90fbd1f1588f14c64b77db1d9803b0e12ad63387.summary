@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 is on the ropes , @entity3 's dropped the gloves , and @entity7 will be in the middle			1
it does n't matter that @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 decided to stay home			1
no more hedging statements , exploratory committees , or one more discussion with the family before deciding to jump into the water headfirst			0
the final boxes have been checked -- save for @entity21			0
for the six others , the race for the @entity24 presidential nomination begins monday night at the @entity2 / @entity28 / @entity27 debate			2
voters will be looking for the candidates to deliver answers on the pressing issues facing the nation , and @entity24 viewers will be watching for a candidate to take on president @entity36 in 2012			1
early polling shows @entity24 voters are not exactly enamored with the current field			1
perhaps that would change if @entity10 and @entity11 decided to run			1
@entity12 told my @entity2 colleague @entity41 the other day that he is on the verge of making it official			0
he will run for president			0
an announcement is expected in the coming days			0
the former @entity48 governor sees the lack of enthusiasm with the current field as an opening , as long as @entity24 primary voters do n't punish him for serving as @entity36 's ambassador to @entity54			1
it is very early in the contest , but still much is at stake : for the " front - runner , " the " perceived alternative , " the " wounded , " the " i told you so , " the " unknowns , " and " those waiting in the wings			1
" here are five things to look for monday night that will help shape the race for the @entity24 presidential nomination : @entity3 vs. @entity7 : for months , we in the media have speculated that @entity3 is setting himself up to be the alternative to front - runner @entity7 , a fellow former governor			1
while @entity7 must battle criticism that he is a flip - flopper , @entity3 is trying to overcome the perception that he lacks the edge needed to be a strong leader			1
@entity3 showed the sharpness of his political knife sunday , when he accused @entity7 of devising the framework for @entity36 's health care law			2
and he coined a new word for the political dictionary : " @entity81			0
" @entity3 will try to show that he not only has the policy chops , but is politically tough and savvy , an important trait some @entity24 voters will be looking for in their nominee to take on @entity36			1
but @entity3 must be careful he does not overreach in his criticism			0
@entity7 , who will be center stage , must successfully weather the expected attacks , punch back and effectively promote his ceo creds			1
@entity7 , a successful businessman , is basing his campaign largely on his ability to fix the economy -- the no. 1 issue facing this nation			2
monday night , he will have the opportunity to sell it to a national audience and try to distinguish himself from his rivals			0
the wounded : former house speaker @entity4 made a politically questionable decision to take a @entity101 cruise during this critical building period of his newly launched campaign			0
when @entity105 returned , his staff fired him , because they did not think he was committed to the campaign			0
there is no question that @entity105 , a former college professor , is an intellect			0
he is a policy - making machine , but the former speaker needs to show tonight that he is unshakable during a time of crisis , and convince primary voters that the staff resignations are an inside - baseball story and he has the ceo qualities needed to run the nation			2
expect @entity105 to follow @entity121 's 11th commandment , which dictated " thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow @entity24 , " and instead focus his criticism squarely on @entity36			2
@entity105 's goal is to try to convince @entity24 voters he is the best candidate to defeat the president in 2012 and the most experienced to deal with the woes that face the nation			1
" i told you so " : at this time four years ago , @entity131 was a minor candidate , at odds with his own party , who was running a presidential campaign on a shoestring budget			1
times have changed , and so has @entity131 's status in the @entity24 field			1
instead of polling in the low single digits , he is now in the mid- to high - single digits , is raising money at a healthy pace , and is no longer considered a fringe candidate			1
what happened ? well , his message seems to have resonated beyond his eclectic group of supporters made up of young adults , anti-war activists and libertarian - minded @entity153			0
he says the country is embracing his views , especially his opposition to the wars and calls for @entity153 troops to leave @entity160			0
tonight , @entity131 will be the same @entity131 that stood on this same stage in @entity0 four years ago , except this time , he has more support and more money			2
but his message will be the same -- and do n't be surprised if he says " i told you so			2
" the unknowns : @entity167 once held a senior @entity24 leadership position in the @entity169 , @entity21 is a member of @entity170 , and @entity171 is a successful businessman - turned - talk show host			2
each is well known in social conservative circles and is vying for the support of this key voting bloc			0
yet these three @entity24 are not household names			2
they face the difficult task monday night of striking a balance -- delivering red - meat rhetoric at the same time they 're introducing themselves to a broader audience			0
@entity21 , @entity171 and @entity167 are competing for the same voters and thus risk splitting the vote three ways			0
monday night , each will make a targeted pitch claiming to be the true social conservative , in the hopes of cementing that status with this important voting bloc			0
waiting in the wings : what will they say during and after the debate ? will @entity10 post a statement on @entity198 criticizing the policies put forward by the debate participants ? perhaps praise them ? will @entity11 weigh in on the debate or simply ignore it ? and will @entity12 , who is just days away from joining the field , pick apart his future rivals ' answers ? betting money is that @entity11 remains mum , @entity12 offers a critique , and @entity10 will have something to say -- on her @entity198 page .			1

early polling shows @entity24 are n't totally enamored with the field
@entity10 and @entity11 , who have n't announced , poll high among @entity24 voters
front - runner @entity7 must weather expected attacks and *counterpunch* effectively
do n't be surprised if @entity131 says , " i told you so "
