-- president @entity1 does n't have much to look forward to in november			1
while a president 's first midterm election rarely goes well for his party , second term presidents do n't fare any better			1
the opposition party , even when struggling in the polls , has traditionally been able to use these elections to mobilize its base			2
the result has been that second term midterms create great congressional obstacles for the president in his final years in office			1
and , based on current polls , 2014 could well fit the pattern			0
take a look at how midterms have affected second - term presidents : 1918 : @entity19 gains in wartime in the midst of @entity22 , republicans rebounded in the midterm elections			1
president @entity24 had a number of major achievements under his belt			1
he had moved a sweeping domestic agenda through @entity29 , including the creation of the @entity31 and the creation of the progressive income tax			0
the president had also been able to mobilize support for @entity37 intervention in @entity22 although @entity24 strenuously campaigned to convince voters that electing @entity40 would help in the war effort , warning voters that @entity19 " sought to take the choice of policy out of my hands and put it under the control of instrumentalities of their own choosing , " his argument did n't persuade			1
republicans gained control of @entity29			0
in the @entity53 , the @entity19 exited the election with a 240 to 192 margin while in the @entity57 , after picking up six seats , they controlled the upper chamber 49 to 47			0
the impact would be significant			0
@entity57 @entity19 would successfully use their power and control of the committees to oppose @entity24 's request to ratify the @entity64 based on their opposition to the @entity37 entering into a @entity66			1
1938 : backlash against @entity69 following his landslide victory in 1936 , @entity69 and the @entity40 seemed unbeatable			1
@entity69 had transformed the federal government with his @entity73 policies			1
in doing so , he had also formed a powerful coalition of industrial workers , farmers , progressive business leaders and intellectuals			0
but the sense of power was fleeting			0
in 1937 , @entity69 tried to expand the size of the @entity82 so that he could appoint more liberals and prevent the court from knocking down any more of his programs ; he also pushed a plan to reorganize the executive branch by granting the president 's staff more sweeping power over @entity29			1
the proposals triggered a fierce backlash			0
@entity40 lost 72 seats in the @entity53 and seven in the @entity57			0
a conservative coalition of @entity40 and @entity97 republicans formed in response and did extremely well in the midterm elections			1
given that @entity40 controlled most of the major committees , the coalition would be able to block many of @entity69 's domestic proposals and remain the dominant force in congressional politics for decades to come			1
1958 : start of a liberal force in @entity29 @entity19 @entity106 was an enormously popular president who coasted to an easy re-election victory against @entity109 @entity108 in 1956			1
but two years after his success , @entity40 scored huge victories in the midterm elections			1
they retained control of both chambers and vastly increased their numbers			0
the @entity117 seats in the @entity57 rose to 65 , from 49 , and 283 in the @entity53 , up from 232			0
it was not just the numbers but the fact there was an influx of @entity123			0
the new members pushed domestic politics in a more liberal direction for the remainder of @entity106 's term and put issues such as health care , civil rights , and federal aid to education onto the national agenda			1
they would be the backbone of @entity137 's coalition in 1964 and 1965 as he moved forward with the @entity138			2
1986 : @entity40 stymie @entity139 's final years in office @entity139 struggled in 1986			1
although he seemed to be on the road to victory after his decisive defeat of @entity144 in 1984 , @entity40 rebounded and in 1986 regained control of the @entity57 with a nine - seat increase in their numbers , thus controlling both houses of @entity29			0
the next two years would be extraordinarily difficult for the president as @entity40 were able to protect domestic programs and even push @entity139 toward accepting measures , such as a tax increase , that went against his ideals			1
more important , the @entity117 @entity29 launched an investigation into the @entity155 , which severely damaged @entity139 's standing and weakened his political position			1
@entity139 would rebound by negotiating a major treaty with the @entity159 , but his ability to move forward with any big ideas was severely hampered			1
1998 : @entity162 leads democrats to gains despite impeachment president @entity162 was the only recent president to do relatively well in his second set of midterm elections			1
for a while , @entity162 seemed to be on the ropes after his re-election			2
republicans retained control of @entity29 , and in 1998 , @entity53 @entity19 were conducting an impeachment proceeding against the president for having lied about his affair with an intern			0
but public sentiment went against the @entity19 , not against the @entity162			2
riding the wave of a booming economy , @entity40 gained five seats in the @entity53 though they failed to regain control			0
2006 : @entity182 suffers a " thumping " president @entity182 was feeling strong after having mounted a successful campaign against @entity185 in 2004 , drawing on the theme of national security			2
however , public frustration with @entity182 was mounting			2
democrats pounded on the administration for his mistakes in handling @entity192 and revelations about interrogations of terror suspects caused trouble overseas			0
many republicans were blasting @entity182 as a big government conservative who had led the nation into an unnecessary war in @entity202			2
on the domestic front , @entity182 tried to use his political capital from 2004 to privatize @entity205 , but the plan backfired			2
in 2006 , @entity182 suffered a " thumping , " as he called it			1
for the first time since 1994 , @entity40 regained control of the @entity53 and @entity57			0
@entity40 wound up with a majority of the @entity53 by 232 to 203			0
the split in the @entity57 was 49 to 49			0
but two independents caucused with the @entity40 , giving them a majority			0
in the coming years , the @entity40 used their position to change the national debate and to place immense pressure on the @entity53 to redirect @entity182 's policy in @entity202			1
in short , other than @entity162 , presidents have suffered greatly in their second terms in the past century			1
the elation and momentum from the president 's re-election fades quickly			2
the problems and burdens that come from being in office , especially after an entire term of controversial decisions , never disappear			2
as with all midterms , partisans turn out to vote much more eagerly than moderates and independents who sit these contests out			0
perhaps @entity1 will be able to pull off what @entity162 achieved given the unpopularity of @entity29 , but it 's not likely			1
the continued controversy over the president 's health care policies and general frustration with @entity29 will make things difficult for @entity40			0
a recent wave of retirements wo n't make things any easier			0
and so it 's conceivable that @entity19 could even regain control of the @entity57 while expanding their majority in the @entity53			0
if so , the tough road that @entity1 has faced will only get that much harder			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity252 .			2

@entity252 : most presidents fare poorly in their second set of midterm elections
he says @entity24 , @entity69 , @entity106 , @entity139 and @entity182 all suffered reverses
in past century , only @entity162 was able to gain strength from second midterm , he says
@entity252 : @entity1 's final years in office could be *shadowed* by midterm results
