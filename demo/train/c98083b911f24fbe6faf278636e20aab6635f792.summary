@entity0 -- @entity2 is using photocopied pages from a geography textbook for @entity6 ninth - graders published 40 years ago to help win international support for its claim to the disputed @entity9 in the @entity10			1
the pages were among documents sent to the @entity13 of the @entity14 , ban ki - moon , with a request that they be circulated among the @entity18 's 193 members			2
it 's the latest attempt by the @entity2 to prove its ownership of an area that @entity6 also claims as its own , as ships from both countries allegedly jostle each other miles from land in the @entity10			1
what 's in the @entity2 papers ? the pages from the geography textbook are just some of the documents in the dossier , which include a map of the region , a note from 1958 and the cover of a @entity36 printed in 1972			2
" @entity2 sent the note to tell the international community the truth and set straight their understanding on the issue , " @entity2 's deputy permanent representative to the @entity14 , @entity37 , said , according to state news agency @entity38			2
@entity44 is trying to catch up with @entity6 , which has mounted an effective public relations campaign to convince the international community of the merits of its case , said @entity49 , senior fellow in the @entity50 at the @entity51 ( @entity52 ) at @entity53			0
" they 're trying to catch up lost ground , " he said			0
" i think @entity6 has been winning the public relations battle over the past few weeks , ever since this incident blew up			0
" how did we get here ? the latest territorial row between @entity6 and @entity2 flared in may when @entity2 's @entity60 ( @entity60 ) moved the drilling rig near what @entity2 calls the @entity9			1
in @entity6 they 're known as the @entity9			2
@entity2 claims @entity60 has been exploring the area for 10 years , and this latest drilling operation " falls well within @entity2 's sovereignty and jurisdiction			2
" @entity6 says the " illicit " rig is placed in its exclusive economic zone and continental shelf , and has demanded @entity2 remove the rig , its vessels and resolve its maritime disputes			1
both sides have been repeating the claims and demands , but neither has budged			0
the standoff at sea seems at least likely to continue until @entity2 removes the rig , as planned , on august 15			2
is a resolution likely ? @entity49 said the issue was unlikely to be resolved by international arbitration as both countries would be reluctant to risk a negative ruling and potential outcry at home			0
especially in the case of @entity6 , who he believes has a weaker claim to the region than @entity2			1
" most objective , independent , international observers agree that @entity2 's case for sovereignty over the @entity9 is better than @entity6 's for the very reasons that @entity2 has now set out in its submission to the @entity14 , " @entity49 said			1
he said the best course of action would be for @entity6 to concede ownership to @entity2 , and to negotiate concessions including access to fishing waters and an agreement to jointly develop oil and gas resources			1
" @entity6 could negotiate concessions with @entity2 but unfortunately it 's probably getting increasingly unlikely as the @entity6 government has locked itself into the idea that the @entity9 are indisputably part of @entity6 and there would be a huge public outcry if they appeared now to be conceding sovereignty , " he said			1
@entity6 ' understandably caught out ' @entity114 , another senior fellow at the @entity52 at @entity53 in @entity115 , said @entity6 was " understandably caught out by the fact that @entity2 was seeking to press its claims			1
" relations in the past few years had been good , he said , with agreement reached on a number of fronts that suggested the countries were moving towards a cooperative approach			0
" i think the unilateral deployment of an oil rig that 's surrounded by a security cordon including naval ships and within the envelope of air cover clearly does n't pass the ' straight face ' test on setting up arrangements of a practical nature			2
i think it was clearly provocative in that sense , " he said , of the @entity2 oil rig			1
claims and counter claims in its " position paper " to the @entity14 , @entity2 accused @entity6 boats of " illegally and forcefully " disrupting the rig 's work by ramming @entity2 government ships a total of 1,416 times			1
the note also claimed @entity6 sent " frogmen and other underwater agents " to the area , and dropped " large numbers of obstacles , including fishing nets and floating objects , in the waters			0
" in its own note to the @entity14 last week , @entity6 accused @entity2 of " seriously " violating its " sovereign right " and repeated claims that @entity2 ships " rammed and sank " a @entity6 fishing boat carrying 10 men			1
at the time , @entity2 said the vessel had been " harassing " a @entity2 fishing boat			0
analysts say the claims and counter-claims are muddying what should be a clear approach to cooperation in the region , as laid out in the 1982 @entity170			0
" even if it 's an area in dispute , there is in the @entity173 an obligation to enter into arrangements of a practical nature , " @entity114 said			0
@entity49 agreed that the legal dispute over who owns what was stalling efforts to protect and develop the region			0
" what i 'm concerned about is all this debate is leading nowhere in terms of establishing effective regimes for managing the @entity10 and its resources , " @entity49 said			0
" it 's taking us away from the effective cooperation that 's necessary because the reality is that i do n't think the sovereignty claims are ever going to be settled in the foreseeable future			0

@entity2 sends documents to the @entity14 backing claim to @entity9
@entity6 also claims the region and is angry about alleged *incursion* into its territory
*tensions* flared after @entity2 sent an oil rig into disputed waters
both sides have accused the other of ramming their ships
