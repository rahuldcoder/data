the @entity1 administration on tuesday lost a @entity3 fight over property rights that centered on a series of federally controlled and managed floods that caused major timber damage along an @entity9 river			1
the 8 - 0 ruling concluded that the periodic release of water from a @entity14 dam project begun two decades ago was a government " taking			1
" the legal designation would require the federal government to pay the state for damages			1
" removing temporary flooding from taking @entity23 inspection would be out of sync with our recognition that , as a rule , temporary takings may be compensable , " said justice @entity20			2
" why should courts differentiate flooding from the myriad other instances of government occupation or invasion of property ? " the dispute is narrow and unique in many ways , but could clarify the standards for determining the scope , length of time , and impact of government actions affecting many property owners -- private and public			1
at issue for the high court was whether the resulting downstream flooding was effectively " permanent " and therefore a " taking , " or was merely " temporary " and only a " trespass			0
" the state of @entity9 owned the flooded land and had earlier won a $ 5.6 million judgment			1
during oral arguments in october , several on the bench expressed support for the state			0
" you knew when you opened up the dam that this is where the water was going to go , " chief justice @entity56 said to a federal government lawyer			1
" your position seems to be that if it 's downstream , somehow it 's not the government 's water , " said justice @entity61			0
" it 's like the old moral refuge that the rocket designers take : i only make the rockets go up ; where they come down is not my concern			0
" the @entity72 completed the @entity73 in 1948 , along the @entity74 in southeastern @entity75 , in response to prior natural flooding			0
about 110 miles downstream , in northeastern @entity9 , is the @entity78			2
it is 23,000 acres of state - owned riparian land used for duck and game hunting , wildlife management , and timber harvesting			1
federal rules for decades had managed normal release of the water , and provided for both " planned " and " unplanned minor deviations			2
" beginning in 1993 the @entity90 launched a series of planned , irregular quick releases of water during the summer growing season in part to give upstream farmers more time to harvest their crops without their fields becoming inundated			0
under the unique dynamics of stream flow and hydraulics , the result was higher water levels downstream , and long - term flooding of the state property during the critical growing period			2
the series of deviations lasted until 2000			0
the @entity110 's @entity109 forbids " private property be taken for public use without just compensation			0
" even thought the land in question is state property , all sides have treated the land as " private " in nature for purposes of settling the " takings " dispute			2
justice @entity123 sat out the @entity9 appeal since she had litigated the case in some form during her previous job as the administration 's solicitor general			1
the case decided tuesday is @entity130 v. @entity131 ( 11 - 597 ) .			0
