-- @entity1 goes through test after test , only to be told he has " chest pain			2
" " why ca n't my doctors tell me what 's wrong ? " he says			1
her doctor orders a cat scan and spinal tap			1
" do i really need these tests ? " she asks			1
we are two @entity14 physicians who see our patients becoming increasingly frustrated at getting more tests , but fewer answers			1
@entity1 's doctors are taught to not tell him what he has ; @entity7 does n't necessarily need invasive tests , but she does need her doctor to listen to her			1
the skyrocketing cost of health care is in the news every day : $ 2.7 trillion spent on health care , 18 cents of every dollar , with up to a third of medical costs wasted			0
but the problem goes much deeper than cost			0
more than 100,000 @entity31 die from medical error every year , with the majority of error attributed to mistakes in diagnosis			0
every day , patients are going undiagnosed or misdiagnosed despite doctors ' increasing reliance on tests , a large number of which are probably unnecessary			1
10 shocking medical mistakes patients feel increasingly out of control and out of touch with their own health			1
well - intended doctors try their best , but they , too , are trapped in a dysfunctional system , which , at least on the surface , appears to reward " cookbook medicine , " which regards all individuals as alike , and punish good judgment			1
how can we move past this stalemate ? we believe that patients hold the key			1
the patient empowerment movement has traditionally been focused on getting information to make better treatment decisions			0
but taking control of your health care begins with something even more fundamental : you have to advocate for getting the diagnosis right			0
to do this , you have to speak up and be heard , so that your doctor can hear your story and partner with you to arrive at an accurate diagnosis			1
the next time you are at the doctor , try our approach to building this partnership -- the 8 pillars to @entity75 : 1			1
studies have shown that more than 80 % of diagnoses can be made based on history alone			0
unfortunately , doctors sometimes seem to want to steer you toward a cookbook " chief complaint " or a series of " yes / no " answers			1
learn to tell a succinct , effective story			0
assert yourself in the doctor 's thought process			1
find out what your doctor is thinking as you recount your history , and let your doctor know what 's on your mind			2
if you 're not starting out on the same wavelength , it 's hard to develop that crucial partnership			0
participate in your physical exam			0
if you 're being examined , make sure you know what the doctor is looking for			2
do n't be afraid to ask about the implications of any findings			0
make a differential diagnosis together			0
a " differential diagnosis " is just the list of all the possible diagnoses that could explain your symptoms			0
make sure you and your doctor come up with a thorough list , with some estimate of the likelihood of each possible diagnosis			2
keep asking what else could be going on			0
partner in the decision - making process			0
devise a strategy with your doctor for narrowing down the list of possible diagnoses			2
by partnering with your doctor , you can often arrive at a working diagnosis without a lot of tests			1
if you do need to undergo further testing , you should understand how a particular test will help narrow down your differential and what the risks and alternatives are			0
look out for " cookbook medicine , " and make sure your doctor is tailoring an approach that works for you			1
you should n't leave the doctor without a working diagnosis that makes sense to you			2
do n't just assume the doctor must be right			2
if the picture does n't add up , go back to the drawing board			0
integrate diagnosis into the healing process			0
talk through your diagnosis with your doctor and make sure you understand its predicted course			2
what treatment options do you have , and what risks and benefits do they carry ? if your working diagnosis turns out to be wrong , what warning signs should you be on the lookout for ? our " 8 pillars " approach empowers patients to participate with their doctors in the diagnostic process			1
opinion : is your hospital hurting you ? to be sure , doctors need to be more effective communicators , and we need a health care system that appropriately rewards partnerships with patients			1
but patients ca n't afford to wait for doctors to improve and the health care system to be reformed			1
your health , and that of your loved ones , is on the line			0
it 's up to you to take an active role and ensure that your doctor is listening			2
you can be , and must be , your own best advocate when it comes to partnering with your doctor and getting to the right diagnosis			2
