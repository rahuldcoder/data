-- along with the figure skating , ice hockey and snowboarding , another event will compete for attention at the @entity6 in @entity7 this month			1
a @entity7 company has created what it calls the " largest thought - controlled computing installation			1
" it 's an experiment that lets visitors to the @entity6 use their brainwaves to control the lights at three major landmarks in @entity7 , including @entity16			1
" when people put on the headsets and find themselves increasing the brightness of the lights by just thinking about it , you can almost see their brains explode , " says @entity17 , chief operating officer for @entity18 , the company that has created this installation			1
as consumers get more comfortable with going beyond the keyboard and the mouse to interact with their computers , companies are looking for alternate ways to make the experience better			0
already , touch and voice recognition have become a major part of the user interface in smartphones , and harnessing brainwaves or other biological data is slowly emerging as a third option , especially in gaming			1
companies such as @entity45 offer headphones that promise to translate the gamer 's brainwaves into action on screen			1
a biometrics company called @entity52 is helping @entity0 host a geeked - out @entity54 party			2
and even @entity55 is working on alternate forms of input ; its @entity58 promises to add gesture recognition to @entity61 games later this year			0
@entity18 's installation is spread across three sites : @entity65 's @entity64 , @entity67 's @entity66 and @entity16			1
all three locations have two chairs set up , each with its own headset			0
the headsets have an external probe that touches the wearer 's forehead to measure the baseline brain activity			2
the chairs are rigged to offer tactile feedback as users enter the desired brain state			0
the headset measures the brain 's electrical output and reacts to alpha waves , associated with relaxation , and beta waves , which indicate concentration			2
as users relax or focus their thoughts , the computer sends a message to the site they are viewing			0
@entity18 's software translates users ' thoughts to commands that will change the lighting display			2
for instance , by concentrating , users can make the lights at the @entity64 spin faster or change the brightness of the lights at @entity16			1
it 's easy enough once users get started , says @entity17			2
" to achieve the beta state we ask users to focus on things like an object ahead and its details , while for an alpha response we ask them to take a deep breath and relax to let their mind go , " he says			0
" but after a minute or two of trying it , we found most users no longer require the physical cues , " says @entity17			0
over the two weeks that the exhibit will be open , @entity18 expects more than 2,000 visitors to try it out			0
