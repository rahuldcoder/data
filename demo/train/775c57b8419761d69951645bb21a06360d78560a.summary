-- ten years ago , the adjective " @entity4 " was an integral tool in any critic 's arsenal			1
it seemed like every other young filmmaker was tramping the bloody , funny trail blazed by " @entity10 " and " @entity11 " ; rueful hitmen lurked around every corner			1
@entity14 and @entity15 star as hitman waiting in picturesque @entity17 in " in @entity18			1
" the fad faded , and the shine has gone off the @entity22 brand name , but his influence is right back with a vengeance in playwright @entity26 's first feature , " in bruges			1
" the film is more @entity4 than anything @entity22 himself has made in years			1
the trouble is , that 's not so much a compliment now			2
it 's more of a mixed blessing			2
@entity15 plays a slow - witted , volatile @entity36 hitman , @entity35 , exiled to the medieval city of @entity18 along with his partner - in - crime , @entity40 ( @entity14 ) , after their latest job has gone awry			1
why @entity18 ? that 's what @entity35 wants to know			1
@entity17 is not high on his list of places to see , and the charms of this " fairy - tale " city are lost on him , to put it mildly : " if i 'd grown up on a farm and was retarded , @entity18 might impress me			1
but i did n't , so it does n't , " he explains			2
@entity40 , on the other hand , is enchanted			2
older and wiser , he burrows into his guidebook and laps up the ancient churches , the canals and cobbled streets			2
in any case , he reasons , the boss would n't have sent them here just to lie low ; there must be a fresh assignment in the offing			2
sightsee later , " is a neat marketing line , but it 's the reverse of @entity26 's agenda			2
prettily photographed by @entity69 , " in @entity18 " should do wonders for the @entity17 tourist biz			1
for half an hour or so the movie ambles along on the strength of its quirky odd couple pairing , taking in the sites : the twitchy , stir - crazy @entity35 reluctantly bowing to @entity40 's sit - back - and - wait strategy			0
@entity15 -- who always seems more energized when he 's acting in his native @entity36 accent -- plays the none - too - bright @entity35 as a big kid , roiling between hedonism and despondency			1
@entity14 is more than an effective foil			1
his somber decency is practically beatific ; all the grace notes are @entity40 's			0
@entity26 already has an @entity84 under his belt for the short " @entity86 , " but he 's better known for savage , provocative plays like " a skull in @entity89 " and " @entity90			0
" his first feature has spurts of cavalier violence and great gales of unfettered bile and profanity -- most of it played for shock and laughter			0
a racist monologue by an inebriated dwarf , for instance , or a couple of comically virulent @entity105 diatribes seem designed purely to raise hackles and the stakes , as if the script had been written on a whim and a dare			0
the writer 's bravado can be exhilarating , but frequently the excess is all there is to hang on to : @entity26 's self - conscious , clumsy direction does n't smooth over some ramshackle plotting			0
still , he also wants to land a few kicks where it hurts			0
@entity35 has more blood on his hands than he can bear			0
if @entity18 is " a hellhole , " it 's a hell of his own making -- he stares intently on @entity124 's " @entity123 " to hammer home the point			1
there 's an @entity36 stew of @entity130 guilt and expiation bubbling away in the background , and @entity26 ladles it on thick in a climax that plunges headlong into surrealism and allegory , with even the worst of the gangsters harping on an antiquated chivalric code			0
( the top dog is played by @entity140 , seemingly intent on out - mugging @entity142 's fearsome @entity141 from " @entity143			0
" ) it has to be said , none of these men are remotely plausible professional killers , and little that they say or do would make sense in the real world			0
in @entity18 -- well , maybe			1
for a spell , at least , @entity26 allows us to entertain that fancy			0
but for all his movie 's tough talk , it 's a sometimes slipshod construction			0
" in @entity18 " is rated @entity156 and runs 101 minutes			1
for @entity158 's take , click here			0

" in @entity18 " about two hitmen *cooling* heels in @entity18 , @entity17
@entity15 , @entity14 star as main characters
*reviewer* : film has *clever* moments , but often excessive without point
