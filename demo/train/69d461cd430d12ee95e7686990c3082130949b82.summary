-- @entity1 lost his right leg in a shark attack when he was 16 years old			1
soon after that he became one of the first people to test out a new prosthetic leg created at @entity7			0
researchers there have developed the first fully robotic artificial leg for above - knee amputees			1
the " bionic leg , " as it is called , uses a variety of sensors and motors that replicate muscle and joint movement in a healthy limb			2
this mechanism creates a more natural stride and allows users to do things that are not possible with normal prosthesis , such as run or go up and down steps and inclines in a natural way			0
while we 're not quite at the point of " @entity31 " bionics , exoskeleton technology is starting to show real promise in helping people with disabilities			0
check out the video above to see the bionic leg in action .			2

bionic leg is the result of a nine - year research effort led by @entity42 at @entity7
the *world* *'s* first fully robotic leg allows amputees to run and *navigate* inclines naturally
the technology was *bought* by @entity49 and is *slated* to be *released* in *2014*
one of its first users is a young *man* who lost his leg in a shark attack in @entity56
