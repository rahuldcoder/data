it 's trust in @entity1 , confiance in @entity3 , and a word used a lot tuesday by president @entity6 and visiting @entity3 president @entity7 to describe what has changed once thorny relations between the @entity11 allies			1
at a news conference on the second day of @entity15 's state visit , the two leaders talked up continuing a new cooperation between their governments that butted heads a decade ago over the @entity19			0
@entity6 will host @entity7 at a state dinner on tuesday night -- the first of his second term -- in another sign of what both depicted as a diplomatic bromance in the face of international challenges that include the @entity29 civil war , @entity31 's nuclear ambitions and economic malaise in @entity33			1
" we 're standing shoulder to shoulder on key challenges , " @entity6 said at one point , while @entity7 declared that " we trust each other in an unprecedented manner			1
" @entity6 to @entity3 in june to underscore the improving relations , @entity6 said he would travel to @entity3 in june at @entity7 's invitation to mark the 70th anniversary of the @entity45 invasion during @entity46 for his part , @entity7 said that " mutual trust has been restored " between his government and the @entity6 administration in the aftermath of classified leaks by @entity53 that disclosed widespread @entity55 surveillance operations in foreign countries			1
a socialist elected in 2012 , @entity7 arrived alone for the trip after revelations in @entity3 of an affair with an actress and the subsequent end of his longtime relationship with @entity63 , who was considered the equivalent of the @entity3 first lady even though they were n't married			2
during tuesday 's news conference that stretched to an hour , no one asked about @entity7 's personal life			2
even for issues on which they may not see completely eye - to - eye , @entity6 and @entity7 emphasized a cooperative spirit in seeking an end to the @entity29 war and a deal with @entity31 to prevent it from developing nuclear weapons			1
asked about the nuclear talks with @entity31 involving their countries along with @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 , the two leaders avoided directly answering if @entity3 had concerns that the @entity55 might push for a less - than - ideal final agreement in order to declare success			1
it 's up to the @entity31 to guarantee their intentions are for peaceful use of nuclear power , @entity6 said , adding that " if they meet what technically gives us those assurances , then there is a deal to be made			1
if they do n't , there is n't			0
" @entity31 problem for his part , @entity7 said a six - month agreement reached with @entity31 to freeze its enrichment in return for easing some sanctions while talks continue " does n't mean that there is no longer an @entity31 problem			1
" " there is an @entity31 problem , for we need to make sure that @entity31 renounce the nuclear weapon in a definite and comprehensive manner , " he said			2
@entity6 has stressed the @entity55 would enforce remaining @entity55 and @entity115 sanctions on @entity31 , pending a permanent accord on the nuclear issues			2
when a reporter asked about a @entity3 business delegation visiting @entity31 , @entity6 warned any companies violating sanctions would " do so at their own peril now , because we will come down on them like a ton of bricks			1
" he added that the @entity55 expects allies such @entity3 to fully observe existing sanctions against @entity31			2
@entity7 , meanwhile , said it was critical that @entity31 renounces nuclear weapons in a " comprehensive manner " in talks going forward , but noted that he lacked authority to tell @entity3 businesses who they can talk with as long as no sanctions violations occur			1
the next round of @entity31 talks begin on february 18 in @entity140			0
@entity31 and @entity142 officials jointly said sunday that @entity31 has agreed to take additional steps by may to ease international concern over @entity146 's nuclear program			0
@entity29 conflict on another @entity149 issue dominating global concern , @entity6 said there was " a horrendous situation on the ground in @entity29 " and he called the ongoing civil war and humanitarian crisis " one of our highest national security priorities " because of extremists gaining greater influence in the " crumbling " nation			0
@entity6 also said his administration was putting pressure on @entity80 -- a major ally of @entity29 president @entity165 -- to help the international community gain access to provide humanitarian aid			0
the message to @entity169 was that expressions of concern about the welfare of @entity29 were not enough " if there are starving people , " @entity6 said			0
@entity7 noted the threats of military action by their countries that he credited with forcing the @entity29 to negotiate the handover of its known chemical weapons stockpiles			0
however , he said @entity29 's compliance with an agreement worked out by @entity80 had brought " only partial destruction " of @entity29 chemical weapons so far that he said " does n't go nearly far enough			0
" affairs -- foreign and otherwise -- surround @entity7			0
