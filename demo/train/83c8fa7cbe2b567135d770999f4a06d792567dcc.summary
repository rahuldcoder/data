@entity0 -- @entity2 actually got this idea sitting in a college classroom at @entity5			1
the 21 - year - old quarterback , soon to graduate with a degree in psychology , is taking the day off from training for the @entity11 draft to take the stand at a @entity14 hearing today and testify against his own university and on behalf of fellow football players			1
the goal : an attempt to revolutionize the way collegiate athletes are treated			2
@entity2 , with the help of a team of lawyers and the @entity24 , is leading an effort to unionize the @entity5 football team			1
backed by the overwhelming majority of the team , @entity2 will kick off a days - long hearing before the @entity14 in @entity0			1
" student athletes do n't have a voice , " @entity2 said at a press conference last month			2
" they do n't have a seat at the table			0
the current model resembles a dictatorship with the @entity37 putting rules and regulations on students without their input			0
" a union would certainly change that			1
it would put the athletes in a position to bargain , to demand things that college athletes have never had before -- like stipends , continuing medical coverage after graduation , more concussion testing and even a portion of the profits of the multibillion dollar windfall created by college football and basketball			1
never before have current players been so vocal in standing up for themselves			0
it 's a bold move , given the incredibly controlling nature of collegiate athletics			1
" these guys at @entity5 are really an inspiration , not just to other football and basketball players and athletes , but these are young men standing together , 70 to 80 guys and they 're taking on a multibillion industry because they know it 's the right thing to do , " said @entity62 , president of the @entity24 , which last season organized the @entity65 wristband protest in support of @entity37 reform at @entity68 , @entity5 and the @entity69			1
" if they win , it immediately sets a standard , " @entity78 said			0
@entity2 came to @entity78 with this idea last year , and @entity78 has been helping him with resources to see it through			1
if they win , it could have a huge effect on the structure of the @entity37			0
despite some quiet resistence at @entity69 and @entity68 against the players who participated in the @entity65 wristband protest in september , @entity5 leaders have been vocally supportive of the leadership exhibited by the team			1
they do n't , however , agree with the idea			1
at the @entity14 hearing , it 's expected to present a handful of experts who will argue that college sports are not a commercial venue			1
" @entity5 teaches its students to be leaders and independent thinkers , " a lengthy statement says , in part			1
but it continues " we believe that a collective bargaining process at @entity5 would not advance the discussion of these topics			1
... our student - athletes are not employees , but students			0
" the @entity37 , which is not a party to the case , also put out a statement opposing the move			0
" this union - backed attempt to turn student - athletes into employees undermines the purpose of college : an education , " said @entity117 , the @entity37 's chief legal officer , in a statement			1
" student - athletes are not employees , and their participation in college sports is voluntary			0
" a seat at the table so , could it work ? @entity133 labor law professor @entity132 said it could , but he cautions that it may take away what fans like about college sports			1
with unions come bargaining , the potential for strikes and lack of stability			0
imagine pickets instead of rivalry games , he said			0
" it 's just very difficult to be confident that if you try to put this on the opposite side of the @entity37 , it 's going to improve things , " he said			1
however , he does think they have a shot at winning this fight			0
@entity133 recently settled a case with graduate students who argued they were both students and employees of the university and deserved rights			1
but even if the athletes at @entity5 succeed , it could be years before they see any change , and it 's unclear how it would affect other teams			1
it 's very likely the players who took the risk to stand up and say something will never see the benefits			2
the hearing that starts tuesday is expected to last through the week			2
the judge has a month to make a decision , and appeals , which could take years to hash out , may potentially go all the way to the @entity176 @entity175			0
" @entity178 reform will always be elusive unless players have a seat at the table , just like the @entity182 , just like the @entity11 , " @entity78 said			0
there 's been growing support for @entity37 reform , mostly because of former @entity187 basketball player @entity186 suing the @entity37 for rights to his own likeness			2
and of course there 's long been a debate about whether the for - profit sport athletes deserve a cut of the money they generate			2
lost in that , though , are stories like former @entity5 player @entity198			1
when he was recruited in 2003 , he was among the top six fastest teens in the state of @entity201			0
but he fractured both legs during his college career and doctors had to put metal rods and screws in both shins			0
he 's in so much pain , he can barely run			2
he 's only 27 years old			2
" i 'm like a 45 - year - old man			0
i ca n't move , " he said			0
@entity78 said most people do n't know that the @entity37 does n't even mandate that colleges cover the cost of medical expenses for current players , and there 's no help at all for former ones			2
each year , $ 30 million is generated by @entity5 football , @entity78 said , " yet ( players ) have no guarantee that medical costs will be covered			1
" @entity198 wants to have the rods removed from his legs , but the procedure could cost him $ 20,000 to $ 30,000 in out - of - pocket expenses , money he does n't have to spare working as a teacher in @entity0			0
" i definitely feel a little let down by the @entity37 in regards to football , " @entity198 said			2
" it 's not like other sports			2
there are concussions that occur			0
if there was protection for players after they graduate that would be a great deal			0
" then he lights up , and says , " i 'm really proud of the guys at @entity5 for taking this stand			1
