-- @entity1 has had to be patient this season			2
@entity4 's arrival at @entity5 was followed by a glut of goals that justified @entity9 's $ 38 million investment in the former @entity11 striker			1
@entity1 also made a big impact two years ago as a relatively little - known signing from @entity13 , being named player of the season as @entity5 won a record 19th league title			1
but last season was a different story as the @entity19 international played a bit - part role and the club 's @entity22 crown was snatched by crosstown rivals @entity24			2
the 24 - year - old came into the 2012 - 13 campaign fresh after @entity9 demanded he miss @entity19 's successful @entity28 campaign , but he has started only five matches out of 16 in all competitions			0
however , a run of seven goals in his last five games means " @entity1 " will be one of the first names on the team sheet next weekend for @entity5 's trip to @entity39			1
" when he came to us two years ago , that 's what we 're seeing again today and , when you score a hat - trick , you pick yourself			0
i think he 'll be playing next week , " @entity9 said after @entity1 inspired another comeback victory against @entity47 on saturday to put @entity5 four points clear at the top of the table			1
the " @entity58 " scored three goals in the two come - from - behind wins against @entity53 that sealed @entity5 's place in the last 16 of the @entity55 , and he came off the bench to rescue the team from 2 - 0 down against struggling @entity47			1
it was the eighth time @entity5 have won this season after going behind			2
@entity1 is claiming a hat - trick , though his equalizing goal appeared to be off - target before it deflected into the net off @entity47 defender @entity64			1
@entity9 had to change his preferred attacking formation at halftime , taking off @entity68 winger @entity67 , after @entity47 took a shock lead with two goals from young @entity72 forward @entity71			2
" we do prefer that one striker with one playing behind , " the 70 - year - old manager said			0
" it did n't work today in the first half but when @entity1 came on and @entity4 dropped a bit deeper , and @entity80 went out to the left - hand side , you had a feeling that if we got a goal we would go on and win it			1
" @entity84 could not add to his league - leading eight goals this season , but he played a key role as he hit the bar twice in the space of a minute and then laid on a perfect freekick for @entity1 to head an 87th - minute winner			2
" it does n't matter who scored the goals , " @entity1 said			0
" the most important thing is who is top of the league and that we came back from two goals down to win			0
" it put pressure on second - placed @entity104 and @entity24 , who respectively host @entity106 and sixth - placed @entity107 on sunday			0
seventh - placed @entity11 lost more ground on the leaders after being held 3 - 3 by @entity111 rivals @entity110 , as midfielder @entity112 missed a last - minute penalty			1
@entity115 's team blew a two - goal lead for the second time this week , having also been held in the @entity55 by @entity118			1
@entity120 striker @entity119 put @entity11 ahead before fellow preseason signing @entity121 added another , but @entity110 's former @entity5 striker @entity124 continued his career revival as he reduced the deficit and then set up @entity128 's 40th - minute equalizer			1
the @entity129 put visiting @entity110 3 - 2 ahead with a penalty but @entity119 leveled before @entity112 's spot - kick was saved by veteran @entity133 goalkeeper @entity132 -- leaving both teams on 16 points from 11 matches			1
" it was frustrating because we had the chances , " @entity115 said			0
" we were caught in too comfortable a position			0
we did the difficult thing , going 2 - 0 up , but then we lacked defensive urgency			0
" @entity143 stayed fourth with a 2 - 1 victory at @entity145 in manager @entity147 ' 400th @entity22 game			1
in - form @entity148 leveled @entity151 's opener with his sixth league goal this season and then set up striker @entity154 for the @entity155 's fifth			0
fifth - placed @entity156 joined the @entity158 club on 20 points following a 2 - 1 win at @entity161			2
@entity162 headed the opener and @entity164 diverting @entity166 effort into his own net before @entity168 reduced the deficit just before halftime			0
@entity171 moved away from the relegation zone with a 1 - 0 win at home to bottom club @entity175 , while promoted sides @entity176 and @entity177 remained in the drop zone after respective draws against @entity39 and @entity180 .			0

@entity1 comes off the bench to inspire @entity5 to victory
@entity186 scores twice and has another effort deflected in by @entity47 player
the 3 - 2 win puts united four points clear at the top of the @entity22
@entity11 lose more ground after *blowing* a two - goal lead for the second time this week
