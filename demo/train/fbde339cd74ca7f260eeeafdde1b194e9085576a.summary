the @entity1 administration has consistently supported measures aimed at reforming mandatory minimum prison sentencing for nonviolent drug offenders			1
but president @entity1 's recent decision to commute the prison sentences of only eight federal inmates -- incarcerated for drug crimes -- has left advocates wanting more			1
the forgiveness of a crime after a sentence is served or the reduction of a sentence currently being served is one of the few presidential powers widely unchecked by @entity17 or the courts			2
commutations are traditionally issued in the weeks leading up to the holidays			2
the eight offenders granted commutations this year ( here is the full list from the @entity24 ) were all serving lengthy sentences , half of them life sentences , for drug offenses related to crack cocaine and methamphetamine			1
although this was the same number of commutations granted in 2013 , many expected the number to be much greater given the @entity36 's april announcement of a new prison reform initiative aimed at making it easier for the administration to pardon or reduce sentences of non-violent offenders			1
" well , it 's a start , albeit a disappointingly small one , " said @entity42 of @entity43			0
" given the administration 's pronouncement that it wants to grant more clemencies , i was surprised they granted the exact same number of commutations as last december			1
" the initiative launched by the @entity1 administration and outside advocacy groups earlier this year was touted as a way to " quickly and effectively identify " inmates serving mandatory minimum sentences that have since been characterized as " out - of - date " and inappropriate , according to a statement made by deputy attorney general @entity58 in may			1
@entity58 said the president 's decision to grant clemency to these eight individuals " sustains his commitment to bring fairness to our criminal justice system			2
while all eight were properly held accountable for their criminal actions , their punishments did not fit their crimes , and sentencing laws and policies have since been updated to ensure more fairness for low - level offenders			1
" but the @entity77 , an advocacy group dedicated to making executive clemency work on the federal level , called the number of commutes " disgraceful in an era of mass imprisonment , " according to a statement posted to their website			1
the advocacy group pointed out that no marijuana , powder cocaine or lsd offenders had their sentences shortened despite the fact that an estimated 2,000 federal inmates qualify for commutation consideration under the administration 's new criteria			1
this new policy dictates offenders must be low - level , nonviolent and without a significant criminal history			1
they also must have served at least 10 years of their sentence and have demonstrated good conduct in prison , with no history of violence before or during their incarceration			2
one federal inmate who clearly meets the @entity36 criteria for commutation is @entity111 , sentenced to two life sentences without the possibility of parole for conspiracy to possess lsd with the intent to distribute			1
he has spent more than 20 years in prison but has been clinging to the hope he will someday be free as a result of the @entity36 's initiative and the absence of a violent past			0
@entity111 's sister , @entity124 , who has dedicated her life to tirelessly efforting her brother 's release , believes that the lack of commutations this year does not indicate a reluctance on @entity1 's part to follow through with prison reforms			1
but it is evidence of the bureaucracy - induced backlog caused by the amount of applications for qualified inmates , she believes			0
related : man hopes new sentencing rules will get him out @entity1 has received 15,646 petitions for commutation since 2009 and , with the addition of the eight granted this year , has granted a total of 21			2
that 's more than the number granted by presidents @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 at the same stage in their presidencies			2
" one of [ the pardoned prisoners ] is @entity157 's friend and he put his petition in two years ago , " @entity154 said			0
" @entity157 's petition has not been submitted			0
it will be in the beginning of the year			0
it has taken them over a year to do his petition			0
" she is still hopeful her brother 's name will be on the list of those released some day in the near future			0
" i believe more will come in the future			0
i think he [ the president ] will keep his promise , " @entity154			0
@entity174 , of @entity43 , which has been working on @entity111 's release , also remains optimistic			0
" i think the new pardon attorney , @entity180 , is genuinely interested in finding deserving candidates , " she said of the new head of the @entity178 , long been seen as the " @entity179 "			0
