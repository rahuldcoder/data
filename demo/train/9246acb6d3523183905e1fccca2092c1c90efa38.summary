-- on the streets of @entity2 , @entity3 , support for slain teenager @entity5 has been overwhelming			2
on the internet fundraising site @entity7 , however , officer @entity6 gets more of the backing			1
the fundraising effort for @entity6 , which began sunday , had raised more than $ 235,000 from 5,900 donors as of friday afternoon			1
that compares with $ 165,000 for @entity5 's family that has flowed in over eight days from roughly the same number of contributors into a page on the same site			1
the sites are peppered with comments that reveal stark contrasts in views			2
" my heart breaks at this injustice , " one person wrote on the page set up to raise money for @entity5 's family			1
" @entity28 bless you and keep you as you move forward with your lives ! thank you for the transparency of where the money will go and how that will be handled			0
" another person on that site saw a larger resonance in the killing by a white police officer of an unarmed black teenager			0
" i am tired of seeing our children cut down like dogs ...			0
. " that person wrote			0
it 's a different story just a few clicks away			0
" i just want him and his family to know how much we care and believe he did the right thing and he is not alone in this , " someone wrote in support of @entity6			2
" every single law enforcement agency in the country should hold a fundraiser or collect $ to donate directly to this officer for his legal expenses , relocation of his family and additional living expenses , " another message said			1
" we are all one law enforcement family			0
" firm conclusions for the disparity in levels of support for @entity6 and @entity5 's family were elusive			1
where is @entity6 ? one limitation of comparing the amount of money raised online is that those figures do not include donations to places that also may be raising money , such as churches , said @entity76 , the editor of the @entity77			1
" they may be more trusted than some of the other organizations , and in a case as explosive as this , trust is a huge issue , " she said			0
on @entity6 's side , he is a police officer -- a group known for vigorously taking care of its own			1
and it would be a mistake to ignore the fact that millions across the country do stand with @entity6 and are happy to back him			2
another factor that could affect giving : researchers have found that people are less likely to give to causes where they find the recipients somehow responsible for their plight , said @entity101 , an associate professor of marketing at @entity102 who has studied why people donate money			0
on the one hand , that could make people less likely to support @entity6 if they conclude that he acted improperly -- some witnesses say he shot and killed @entity5 even though @entity5 had his hands raised			1
on the other hand , it could translate into diminished support for @entity5 's family among people who focus on police assertions that @entity5 stole cigars and roughed up a convenience store employee moments before the shooting , or on reports that say he shoved the officer and wrestled for his gun			1
regardless of the reasons , both @entity76 and @entity122 , a marketing professor at the @entity123 , said focusing on the donations leaves out a huge part of the story : the direct support for @entity5 on the street			2
protesters have vowed to force change , and some lawmakers have proposed legislation to address some of the issues raised by the shooting			0
" lots of people are supporting @entity5 in other ways , and these actions may be more useful than donations , " @entity122 said			0
@entity141 releases song in support of @entity2 @entity2 residents say police have ' a power trip problem '			0

supporters of officer @entity6 donate $ 235,000 for him , as of friday afternoon
that compares with $ 165,000 raised for @entity5 's family over more time
firm conclusions for the disparity are hard to draw
