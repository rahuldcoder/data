@entity0 -- built into the by - laws of most sports @entity3 is something called a " character clause			0
" it 's a loosely - defined metric meant to gauge whether a potential @entity3 ' off - the - field conduct should prevent an athlete or coach from being honored			1
the rules use words like integrity , sportsmanship and community to determine whether a sportsman or woman can be inducted into the prestigious club			2
but once that tribute is bestowed and a @entity3 made , can it be rescinded and undone ? " it would be unprecedented , " said @entity21 , a spokesman for the @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity0			0
do sanctions alter @entity27 legacy ? " i suppose they could , " added @entity28 of the body that governs the @entity30			0
that question is now being tossed around about the late @entity33 , a college football @entity3 since 2007			1
officials at the professional basketball , football , baseball and collegiate basketball and football @entity3 say it 's never happened before			2
while governing - bodies may use the clause to keep out candidates , once inducted , a @entity3 's status is historically safe			1
but this week 's " unprecedented " @entity47 sanctions against @entity27 for its handling of a child sex abuse scandal threaten to shake that very bedrock and raise questions of whether @entity33 will be removed from its ranks			1
" the question is ' what do you want your @entity59 ) to stand for ? ' " said @entity55 's @entity54 , a college football writer			2
" is there a character component to it ? " an internal review found the former head coach could have stopped @entity66 's sexual attacks against young boys had he done more , and that he may have known more than what he initially told the grand jury			2
vestiges of the @entity33 legacy , once an enduring symbol of integrity , have since vanished amid the scandal			1
within a two - day span this week , his famous bronze statue in front @entity77 was hauled down , as was his record atop major college football 's all - time wins list			2
the @entity47 wiped more than a decade 's worth of @entity27 wins from the record books , slapped the school with a four - year postseason ban and imposed a $ 60 million sanction after investigators blamed top university leaders , including @entity33 , for their " total and consistent disregard " of victims while a sexual predator lurked on campus			1
" this egregious behavior not only goes against our rules and constitution , but also against our values , " said @entity93 , @entity94 president and chairman of the @entity47 's executive committee			2
@entity27 review recasts story of football hero @entity33 @entity33 's official record moved from 409 wins to 298 , dropping to him to 12th on the @entity47 college football coaching list , while also vacating six bowl wins and two conference championships			1
the @entity110 board has not indicated its thinking on @entity33 in the wake of the scandal or the release of the findings			1
" we 're very aware of all of this , " said @entity116 , president and ceo of the @entity118 , the @entity119 's governing body			1
" our group is very methodical , " he said , when asked if the group was considering @entity33 's removal , adding that board members are expected to meet in early october			1
" everything 's taken into consideration			2
" in 2007 , the group inducted a still actively coaching @entity33 alongside @entity129 's @entity128 , amending rules that required a candidate to be retired to qualify			1
the @entity119 currently says in his biography , " no coach has been as synonymous with one school as has @entity27 's @entity33			1
" " more important than all of the wins and titles he has accumulated may be his legacy with the influence he has had on his players , @entity142 and alumni , " it reads			0
in 1992 and 2006 , the foundation awarded him the @entity145 and the @entity147 awards			0
report : @entity27 faced 4 - year ' death penalty ' although the board has n't indicated its thinking , students at @entity27 now offer mixed impressions about the prospect of yet another trace of their former coach wiped from the public sphere			2
" i do n't think they should remove him ( from the @entity22 ) , " said @entity158 , a 21 - year - old @entity27 senior			0
" well , i do n't know , " she then wavered			0
" that 's a touchy subject			2
he built up our school			0
he was a philanthropist and he did a lot for us			0
... but he should have done more			0
" the issue has again put front and center the question of whether sports figures , often lauded as heroes , should be judged in the annals of sports history by way of their off - the - field conduct			0
in @entity178 , sports writers with the @entity177 vote not only for athletic prowess , but also on a player 's " integrity , sportsmanship , character , and contributions to the team ( s )			2
" banned from baseball amid @entity188 fixing and gambling scandals , @entity190 great " @entity191 and the league 's all - time hits leader @entity194 are barred from even being considered			2
photos : @entity33 through the years but at the @entity197 , voters decide based solely on what happened on the field			1
" people asked us during the @entity208 trial , that if he were convicted , would he be kicked out ? " said @entity200 , a vice president for communications at the @entity202 in @entity203 , @entity204			0
" the answer is simple : no. " players and coaches ' behavior outside - the - lines does n't change what got them inducted , @entity200 explained			2
in college , the rules are different			0
while football coaches must boast at least a 60 % winning percentage and have coached for a minimum of 10 years and 100 games , candidates must also demonstrate a laudable " post-football record as a citizen			0
" " he must have proven himself worthy as a citizen , carrying the ideals of football forward into his relations with his community and his fellow man with love of his country , " according @entity118 website			1
@entity27 alum : ' we are more than this tragedy ' those standards for years kept out @entity238 , a 1959 @entity239 - winner from @entity240 , who was nominated in 1983 before his arrest and confession to a $ 6 million counterfeiting scheme			0
the scandal rocked @entity240 and prompted the foundation to rescind his membership bid before induction			0
but a quarter of a century later , the former running back - turned dentist was offered a second chance and formally inducted in 2008			0
others like @entity253 star @entity252 , a @entity255 stand - out who last year pleaded guilty to sexual misconduct , have not gained entry to the club despite appearing on the ballot			0
meanwhile , @entity66 -- a former assistant coach who continues to maintain his innocence -- awaits sentencing for sexually abusing minors over a 15 - year period			0
some of the abuse occurred in the same campus building where @entity33 worked , according to the findings of former fbi director @entity267 and his team of investigators			1
the @entity267 report drew criticism for its lack of access to critical witnesses , including @entity33 , who died in january			1
his family also reminded the public that " @entity33 has never had a hearing , " and that tearing down his statute would " not serve the victims of @entity66 's horrible crimes or help heal the @entity280			1
" photos : final tributes , @entity33 statue removed but the report -- albeit limited in scope -- shed new light on the scandal and raised questions about whether @entity33 's marred legacy will affect his spot among gridiron greats			1
nicknamed " @entity33 , " fans adored him for a storied coaching career that brought @entity27 football to national prominence			1
but the university 's board of trustees fired @entity33 in november 2011 following a 46 - year career because his " decision to do his minimum legal duty and not to do more to follow up constituted a failure of leadership			1
" @entity33 reported to his superiors a child sex abuse incident in a university shower that involved @entity66 in 2001 , but did not inform police			1
his ouster prompted student riots , overturning a news van and clashing with police , who used tear gas to break up throngs of angry protesters			0
since then , material reminders of that legacy have faded			0
at @entity318 , the name of a popular football camp - out is now called " @entity321 , " rather than " @entity322 , " and a famous local mural no longer shows a halo painted above the image of the school 's former head coach			0
but it 's unclear whether @entity33 's place in the @entity22 will go the way of his famed 900 - pound bronze statute removed from the university earlier this week , a structure that once exuded a sense of permanence that greeted fans at @entity27			1
@entity27 alum : we deserved @entity47 penalty paterno loyalists call @entity47 sanctions excessive opinion : was the @entity47 too quick to punish @entity27 ?			0

@entity110 's board members are expected to meet in early october
" we 're very aware of all of this , " said @entity116 , ceo of the @entity118
