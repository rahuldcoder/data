some @entity0 who have never traveled outside of their country of birth could suddenly find themselves outsiders			1
the citizenship of tens of thousands of @entity0 of @entity6 descent may be stripped , the result of a court ruling that affects those who were born to parents who were in the country illegally			1
@entity0 of @entity6 descent have long faced inequalities , but the enforcement of the last month 's ruling will take social exclusion to an extreme			1
the question of how to integrate immigrants into the national fabric and how to treat them is a familiar debate			0
in the @entity0 , as in the @entity24 , for instance , children of undocumented parents are considered citizens if they were born in the country			2
but while there have been efforts in the @entity24 to extend opportunities to even more children of immigrants , the @entity27 of the @entity0 has taken a very different approach			2
the court ruled that even those who were born in @entity0 territory , if their parents were in the country illegally , should not have citizenship			1
how are they going to take away a document that i already have , that is mine , and give me one as a foreigner when i have never been outside of the country ? " said @entity41 , a representative of a movement to protect the rights of those affected			0
already , since 2007 , a law blocked many @entity0 of @entity6 descent from acquiring copies of their birth certificates or national identification cards			1
one of those blocked from getting a national id card was 29 - year - old @entity55 , who then took her fight to the courts			0
the high court affirmed that @entity55 did not meet the criteria for citizenship , even though she had been born in the country			2
the court went further , asking authorities to identify similar cases stretching back to 1929			0
the @entity65 expressed concern , stating that , " should this process indeed be carried out without the necessary safeguards , three generations of @entity0 of @entity6 descent could become stateless			1
" the country 's @entity70 on wednesday met with representatives of various government ministries and agencies to plan how the court ruling will be enacted			1
the government says that no one who has their citizenship stripped will be deported , and that a system to give them legal status with a path to citizenship will be put in place			2
that path to citizenship will include a two - year wait to begin the process			0
" the @entity0 government reiterates its commitment to the implementation of an immigration policy that is clear and transparent , in line with the @entity95 and @entity0 laws while respecting human rights and international accords , " government spokesman @entity88 said			1
the government 's assurances , however , have not ameliorated the fears of @entity0 of @entity6 descent , who are protesting and calling for support at home and abroad			1
" this measure affects us so much that we ca n't do anything , " said @entity104 , the daughter of @entity6 immigrants			0
" this brings consequences such as not being able to work , not being able to study , to not realize the dreams that we have to get ahead in life			0
" critics point out the complications that are sure to arise : what about mixed - status families ? how can it be that many who cast votes that affected election outcomes are losing that right ? what about all the taxes they paid as citizens ? " we are not talking about immigrants , but fellow @entity0 , " said the rev. @entity126 , national director of social work for the @entity128 in the @entity0			2
many @entity0 of @entity6 descent are already among those with the fewest economic resources , and this takes away the little they have , he said			1
" they do n't have access to the same rights because they are being treated like immigrants in their own country , " @entity126 said			0
" in truth , they have not immigrated from anywhere			0
many of them have never been outside of the @entity0			0

a court ruling could strip the citizenship of tens of thousands of @entity0
