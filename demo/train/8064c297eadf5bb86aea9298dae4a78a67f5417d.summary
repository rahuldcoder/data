@entity13 equaled the record of 49 goals in a @entity8 season with a penalty six minutes after halftime , with @entity3 defender @entity19 sent off for dragging down @entity20			1
real , thrashed 5 - 0 in the @entity22 capital in november , fought back despite the numerical disadvantage and leveled with nine minutes to play after @entity24 was fouled by @entity9 fullback @entity25			2
the result left the visitors eight points clear at the top of the table with six games to play , ahead of wednesday 's @entity33 final between the two teams in @entity35			0
marvelous @entity37 record falls -- but will it ever be beaten ? they will also meet in the semifinals of the @entity40 , with the first leg in @entity3 on april 27 and the return on may 3			0
" a draw at the @entity49 is a good result and i am happy with how we played , although maybe we could have done better at 1 - 0 , " @entity9 coach @entity43 told @entity44 after dropping his first points in six league games against @entity3 since taking over the role in 2008			1
" i do n't think we are league champions ( yet ) as we have to play against teams that are still fighting for their lives			0
" @entity37 , wary of a repeat of his worst defeat as a club coach , started with a defensive line - up as @entity59 was pushed forward into a three - man midfield alongside @entity61 and @entity62 to combat @entity9 's attacking potency			1
@entity64 appealed in vain for a penalty in the 26th minute after going down under the challenge of goalkeeper @entity68 , and it was @entity3 who went closest to scoring first as defender @entity71 had to clear @entity1 's header from a corner off the line just before halftime			1
the @entity76 forward hit the base of @entity79 ' post with a dipping freekick five minutes after the interval , but @entity3 went behind straight away when @entity19 hauled down @entity64 in the box after first appearing to handle the ball			1
@entity13 record as @entity9 reach semis @entity13 stepped up to score his first goal against one of @entity37 's teams and match the mark set by legendary @entity91 @entity90 in the 1959 - 60 season -- his 30th league goal in just 29 games			1
@entity37 shuffled his cards by bringing on attacking midfielder @entity96 for striker @entity97 , and @entity9 lost captain @entity98 to a hamstring injury before @entity61 shaved the top of @entity68 ' bar with a swirling shot			0
the influential @entity98 had returned after three months out with a knee injury , but is now in doubt for the remaining three @entity105			0
@entity3 refused to give in , and the introduction of striker @entity107 helped spark a series of attacks that could have brought more reward than just @entity1 's penalty after @entity25 brought down his fellow @entity112			1
he sent @entity79 the wrong way for his 41st goal this season , 29 of them in @entity12 , to set up a tense finish with even the usually calm @entity13 losing his cool			0
@entity62 had the chance to snatch an 89th - minute winner but the @entity122 international shot low at @entity123 , and @entity9 held on in four minutes of time added on			2
@entity35 consolidated third place with a 3 - 0 win at bottom club @entity127 earlier on saturday , closing the gap on @entity3 to 13 points			2
striker @entity130 scored his seventh goal in three games , heading his 13th this season to open the scoring six minutes after halftime from @entity137 's cross			0
@entity139 defender @entity138 doubled the lead from close range on 66 , and midfielder @entity142 wrapped it up with a volley 10 minutes from time			0
the win put @entity145 's team nine points clear of fourth - placed @entity147 , who host third - bottom @entity149 on monday			2
fifth - placed @entity150 suffered a shock 1 - 0 defeat at @entity153 , who moved four points away from the relegation zone after ending a run of nine league games without a win			1
@entity161 striker @entity160 scored the only goal with 14 minutes to play to give the @entity3 - based team some breathing space			2
@entity165 moved out of the bottom three on goal difference above @entity149 with a much - needed 3 - 0 victory at home to 10th - placed @entity169			0
@entity171 striker @entity170 opened the scoring in the 26th minute before @entity112 forward scored a goal in each half to boost coach @entity176 , who at this stage last season was still in charge of @entity3 .			0

@entity9 maintain eight - point lead in @entity8 after 1 - 1 draw away to rivals @entity3
