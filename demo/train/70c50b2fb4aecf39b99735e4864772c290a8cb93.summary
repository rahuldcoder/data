-- when you 're a billionaire , you can make an almighty splash			2
@entity3 , arguably the world 's most hotly - anticipated yacht , has finally taken to the seas and for its billionaire owner @entity7 , it 's a chunk of money that could land him a place in the record books			1
the 100 - foot monohull vessel is the brainchild of high - school drop - out @entity7 , who made his fortune in computer science -- co-founding @entity17 and making timely investments in @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			1
@entity7 , valued at $ 1.4 billion by @entity22 , likens the project to " building a @entity25 car from scratch although hopefully not quite as expensive			1
" the sleek black and red vessel is at the very cutting edge of its sport with a top speed expected to approach the 40mph mark			0
" i feel like an expectant father , " says @entity7 , whose @entity33 wife @entity32 is a model and television host			1
" the whole thing when your child is about to be born , you just want it to be healthy			0
it 's not unlike this			2
you 're just praying the boat stays in one piece and that 's a realistic fear with such a cutting - edge project like this			1
" the 70 - year - old 's appointed skipper is @entity50 , of @entity51 , the world 's leading sailmaker , who has overseen the project since its inception three years ago			2
@entity50 , a two - time skipper for @entity56 's @entity55 in the @entity57 , admits to sleepless nights in the build - up to its first foray on water			2
@entity7 likes to talk about how the team behind his creation " is pushing the envelope " with @entity3 , which lends its origins in part to the yacht @entity67 , which was launched in 2008			1
designed by @entity69 ( @entity70 ) and @entity71 , @entity3 's creation has been fast track , the build itself usually expected to take two years but , in this instance , crammed into just one with up to 40 workers on hand			1
@entity7 admits that his creation , " lost value the moment it hit the water			1
" so why spend some of your personal fortune on what many people would label a vanity project ? " people spend money on sports and i just do n't do golf , i hate it , " says the 70 - year - old			0
" but i love sailing and the technology aspect			2
" born and brought up in the arid landscape of @entity95 some way from the nearest coastline , @entity7 's background does not immediately lend itself to a nautical life			1
but he joined the @entity99 and , after three - and - a - half years on the ocean , it became a part of him			0
" it was in the late 1980s that i bought my first sail boat and , from there , you always want to get something bigger , " he says			2
" then you get to a point where you want to downsize			0
" which is what he plans to do after @entity3			1
his other yacht , @entity111 , is currently moored in @entity112 and up for sale at $ 75m			2
for now , @entity3 , is the sole focus			1
the name is close to his heart			0
the last @entity3 tribe chief @entity117 surrendered about 60 miles from where @entity7 grew up in an area where " the plains are very flat like the ocean "			1
the primary goal , admits @entity7 , is " to be a record breaker " and he says , with a throaty laugh , that the boat " will go really , really fast			1
" the target is to win such events as the @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 while breaking records in the process , before selling @entity3 in two years			1
as for the origins of it , there are two slightly differing tales			0
@entity7 tells the story of going out on the first @entity139 , @entity141 's boat that has dominated the @entity142 to @entity144 race , and being blown away by the technology of a keel boat			1
there and then , the seed of an idea was planted			0
@entity50 , meanwhile , adds : " @entity7 and @entity149 are probably the two most competitive people i 've ever met			1
they go to @entity33 each year for @entity152 and obviously @entity142 - @entity144 is a massive deal out there			1
" they 've got friends that are boat owners and they got egged on by their buddies , almost like ' come and play with the big boys '			2
" it is befitting then that @entity3 's first race should be @entity144 , although it is not without its perils			1
the 1998 edition of the race remains infamous for the freak weather conditions that struck and left six people dead			0
" this is so cutting edge that we 'll got into that race with lingering doubts it might go wrong , " admits @entity50			0
" did we push it too far ? sure , there are sleepless nights and i would love to lower expectations			0
" i wish @entity142 - @entity144 was n't the first race , in fact you could n't choose a worst race for our first race			1
it 's like we 've gone straight from the gym to the heavyweight championship of the world			2
and it could end up like an @entity25 car blowing its engine on its first outing on the track			0
" and these are not inherently safe boats as they 're built on the cutting edge			0
we just do n't know			0
" @entity7 is hopeful , though , that @entity50 and his crew of 21 can produce a knock - out blow and halt @entity139 in its tracks as it bids for an eighth win in the 630 - nautical - mile race that gets under way each year on @entity200 ( december 26			2
) the race is part of the @entity33 sporting psyche , on a par with the @entity205 , the @entity207 tennis or an @entity209 cricket test match between @entity33 and @entity210			0
for @entity50 , @entity3 and its crew , @entity142 - @entity144 will be something of a trip into the unknown but with the technology on board and money spent , @entity50 is all too aware that the expectation will be high in subsequent races			1
" we want records but we have to win the races first and then think about the records , " he says			2
" but to do that the conditions have to be right			0
you can have the greatest thing since sliced bread but you wo n't go record breaking if the weather 's not right			0
but if we get into the record books -- and we believe we will - then it 's job done			0
" @entity50 does not lack for experience : a six - time j - 24 world champion , twice @entity233 yachtsman of the year and two - time skipper in the @entity235 , and he is adamant the safety of his crew is of paramount importance			0
read and the @entity241 have become close friends during their time together , @entity7 's only regret as a septuagenarian is that he is no longer young enough to be on board in some of @entity3 's tougher races			1
his bad ankles mean he will mostly be their leading cheerleader on shore with his two younger children , three - year - old @entity248 and eight - week old @entity249			0
" my wife 's an @entity33 and a very competitive lady , " says @entity7 , " and she wants to sail in @entity144			1
i say ' we have the boat , do as you wish '			0
i 'll let her run the show			0
" the record books are on the horizon .			0
