-- a controversial photography exhibit called " in the playroom " depicts young children reenacting tragic and violent historical events , including the september 11 attacks and the abuse of inmates at @entity9 's infamous @entity8 prison			1
the artist , @entity11 , says his work is an attempt to reflect on modern events that affect children and prompt dialogue about " issues in our world			1
" but the photos have also drawn criticism from those who say @entity11 's use of artistic license involving children crosses an ethical boundary			1
" some of it is appropriate , " said psychiatrist @entity26			0
" but i do n't know that it 's appropriate to put a scarf around a girl 's neck like she 's going to be strangled with out really understanding what that 's about			0
" @entity26 was referring to one of @entity11 's photographs in which a young girl is depicted as slain 6 - year - old @entity38 @entity39 , who was found dead in the basement of her @entity42 home in 1996 after being strangled			2
the image portrays the girl dressed in beauty pageant attire while holding a mauve - colored scarf around her neck			0
@entity26 said he commended the photographs for their portrayal of events that affect children , but cautioned that the children likely " did n't understand what they were doing			1
" he also warned against placing young children in situations that could potentially traumatize or frighten them , cautioning that the effects of traumatic events commonly surface later in life			1
but @entity11 defended his work , arguing that " media is so pervasive its almost inescapable " and the exhibit endeavored to show how these events are " part of our culture			1
" " we have to acknowledge it , " he said			0
others are n't so sure			0
