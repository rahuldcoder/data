from footfalls to climbing stairs , to opening doors , the cities of the future will look at ways of tapping energy from all the mechanical energy we expend going about our daily lives			0
when looking at the amount of kinetic energy produced in the average metro station at rush hour , or even on the dance floors of nightclubs , harvesting electricity from human activity makes sense			1
the technology that makes it possible -- the piezoelectric effect -- is more than 130 years old : in 1880 , the brothers @entity24 and @entity25 discovered that placing crystals under pressure produced an electric charge			2
today , manufacturing technology has made it possible to place piezoelectric devices in the most unlikely places and one company , @entity33 , has developed power - generating systems for pavements , football fields and even school corridors			1
" people walk up to 150 million footsteps in their lifetime , " @entity33 ceo @entity38 told @entity2			1
" when i was walking through a busy train station in @entity43 i thought what if we can convert the energy from every single person walking at the station into a meaningful amount of power			2
" the company 's footfall harvesting technology -- a deflecting pad covered with the type of soft ground surface commonly found in playgrounds - can produce up to 7 watts of energy with each step			1
collecting this energy , @entity38 says , is enough to power lights and other small devices for minutes at a time from a mere one hundred or so footfalls			2
the technology is most effective in areas with high traffic , producing an efficient solution that matches supply with demand			0
in @entity71 , @entity72 , for instance , the company installed 200 kinetic tiles into a local football pitch in @entity75 -- a favela plagued by blackouts			0
the @entity33 tiles work day and night alongside solar panels to power the lights for up to 10 hours on a full battery , creating the world 's first ever people - powered football pitch			1
" it 's not only a way of inspiring future generations into energy savings but it shows we need different energy mixes , " @entity38 said			0
" some people walk 40,000 steps a day , so there 's a lot of potential in those wasted footsteps			0
" most people go to a gym so why are we plugging in those treadmills ? why not have those self - powered to charge your cellphone ? to power the aircon in the building ? use the energy in a new way ? " the company this year installed 36 tiles to create two people - powered dance floors at the 20th @entity112 , placing digital screens in front of the dance floors to display the amount of energy produced during each dance off			2
energy - harvesting technology has even been developed for miniature applications including self - powered contact lenses that use blinking as their power source			1
much like @entity127 glasses , the battery - free contact lenses could deliver information to a user that would be projected before a users ' eyes as if it were thrown up on a screen			0
despite the one - off niche applications , @entity33 has ambitious plans for the sector as a fully scalable renewables producer			0
analysts estimate the energy harvesting industry could be worth as much $ 30 billion by 2018			1

a company called @entity33 has developed a technology to turn footsteps into electricity
walking and other human activities can generate power via piezoelectric cells
@entity33 's energy harvesting technology can produce up to 7 watts of electricity with each footstep
analysts estimate the energy harvesting industry could be worth as much $ 30 billion by 2018
