-- i have a mission for you			0
one so lofty , so arduous , so utterly impossible that many of you may abandon the cause			0
we 're going to reclaim the @entity8			1
why ? for the same reason we climb mountains , cross seas and eat an entire pie in one sitting : because it 's there			2
yes , since the inception of the social networking site , the mysterious option to poke friends has been available -- and it has n't really changed since then			1
in the early days of @entity8 , a version of the faq noted that @entity23 and @entity24 just wanted to create something with no real purpose			1
that 's not really rational when you think about it			2
as @entity34 said , " one must not put a loaded rifle on the stage if no one is thinking of firing it			0
a poke is basically equivalent to a loaded gun -- an apt description , really , considering it 's become a kind of weird weapon over the years			1
what started as a mere bauble has morphed into a tool only regularly used by utter and complete creepers			0
we conducted an online survey of a few hundred of our friends , fans and followers , and 55 percent banished poking to the realm of " ick			2
" still , when asked whether they had ever poked anyone themselves , 59 percent of respondents said yes			0
so why the disdain for the digit , yet the predilection for the @entity8 ? herein lies the purpose of our mission			1
yes , the @entity61 may have strayed into the realm of 4chan and tell - all web shows , but it has not yet gone the way of @entity66			1
on that note , we call upon you , individuals of the internet persuasion , to take back the @entity8 ! here 's how : engage in a poke war with a friend yes , it seems entirely retro -- in the way that things from about six years ago seem retro -- but poke wars were all the rage among the socially starved denizens of the original @entity8 , and it 's time to bring them back			1
according to our survey , most of you -- about 60 percent -- would be down with poking a friend , so why not just keep going ? research suggests that social networking increases levels of oxytocin -- a trust / generosity chemical -- in our brains			1
so why not stimulate trust via a rash of digital violence most often favored by 5 - year - olds ? remind a faded friend of your existence " oh man , i have n't talked to @entity100 since high school -- you know , after he got all ' excited ' while dancing with @entity103 , the foreign exchange student , and had to go home ' sick			2
' still , me and @entity100 were tight back in the day			0
i wonder what he 's up to ? " give or take a few details , this has probably been your inner dialogue regarding some shade from your past at one time or another			0
while you may not feel entirely comfortable writing said friend an e-mail , or giving him a call -- like you still have his digits anyway -- a poke serves as a kind of , " hey ! remember me ? we were friends once ! let 's reconnect ! " ( yes , exclamation marks are always inherent in the @entity61 )			1
think of it as the digital version of an enthusiastic chance encounter at the drugstore -- without all the awkward juggling of dandruff shampoo and condoms			0
getting some action naturally , the @entity8 is replete with sexual connotations			2
in fact , about 31 percent of those surveyed said they would poke someone they want to sleep with			0
@entity139 , whose comedy site @entity141 recently made a viral video titled " @entity143 : getting poked , " asserts , " poking is a way of saying ' hi ! you 're cute and i 'd like to have sex with you ' -- it 's more than flirting , but not a hard request for intercourse ... which means less impact of a ' rejection			0
' " it 's also a totally weak move			0
as one of those surveyed said : " it 's @entity8 's creepy tool of socially acceptable sexual molestation			1
" so instead of just poking some dude you 're into , might we suggest a more subtle form of flirtation ? a method that the folks over at @entity166 -- a popular @entity8 application launched in 2007 that allows you to wave , roundhouse kick , etc. -- assure us is a true classic : throw a sheep at him			1
if he 's into weirdos , he 'll be totally smitten -- and if he 's unimpressed , he 's probably into boring vanilla poking @entity175 , anyway .			0

*columnists* : we should take back the @entity8 because it 's there
casual survey says *majority* do n't like the @entity61 , but that most have used it
you can start a poke war with a friend or reconnect with an old acquaintance
do n't poke with romance in mind ; instead , use " @entity191 " and send a sheep
