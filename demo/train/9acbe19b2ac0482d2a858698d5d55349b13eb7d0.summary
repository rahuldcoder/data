-- a federal appeals court ruled tuesday that a cross displayed on public property for nearly a century is unconstitutional			1
three versions of the @entity6 symbol have been erected atop 822 - foot @entity7 in the posh @entity9 neighborhood of @entity10 , @entity11 , since 1913			1
the current 43 - foot cross was erected in 1954 in honor of @entity15 veterans and has been the subject of near constant judicial back and forth since 1989 , when two @entity19 veterans filed suit against the city , saying it violated the @entity24 's " no preference " clause			2
the 9th @entity26 rejected the notion that the cross -- since the late 1990s surrounded by plaques and paving stones honoring veterans and war dead -- was solely a memorial			2
" the use of such a distinctively @entity6 symbol to honor all veterans sends a strong message of endorsement and exclusion , " the court said in its ruling			0
" it suggests that the government is so connected to a particular religion that it treats that religion 's symbolism as its own , as universal			0
to many @entity50 veterans , this claim of universality is alienating			0
" the court also noted that the site had , for most of history , been used for @entity55 services -- marked on maps until the late 1980s as the " @entity57 " -- and was designated a war memorial with a plaque " only after the legal controversy began in the late 1980s			1
" " it was not until the late 1990s that veterans ' organizations began holding regular memorial services at the site , " the court said			2
and the court rejected arguments that the cross at a war memorial was no different than any other memorial that includes a cross			1
" this war memorial -- with its imposing @entity75 -- stands as an outlier among war memorials , even those incorporating crosses , " the ruling says			1
" contrary to any popular notion , war memorials in the @entity81 have not traditionally included or centered on the cross and , according to the parties ' evidence , there is no comparable memorial on public land in which the cross holds such a pivotal and imposing stature , dwarfing by every measure the secular plaques and other symbols commemorating veterans			1
" the ruling will almost certainly be appealed to the @entity81 @entity95			0
since the first lawsuit in 1989 , the city of @entity10 twice tried selling the property beneath the cross to the @entity100 , only to be stopped by the courts : once for failing to solicit bids and once for violating @entity11 's " no preference " clause for giving " substantial financial advantage to bidders " who intended to leave the cross in place			1
by the late 1990s , with the association maintaining the property , the cross became a more extensive war memorial , with stone plaques and paving stones honoring veterans and other accoutrements of a memorial			1
in 2004 , the city , the plaintiffs and the association reached an agreement that would move the cross to a nearby church , but two @entity125 congressmen intervened and inserted a rider into the 2005 omnibus budget bill that designated the property as a national veterans memorial and authorized the federal government to accept the donation of the property			0
but the @entity133 refused to donate the property after the city attorney wrote that the transfer likely would violate both the federal and state constitutions			0
facing pressure from a new association formed to " save the @entity7 cross , " the city reversed its decision and instead put the matter to a vote , which passed handily			2
more court filings followed , and in june 2006 , three @entity125 congressmen pushed through a bill calling for the government to seize the property by eminent domain -- calling it " a historically significant war memorial			1
" the federal government took possession in august			0
two lawsuits were filed challenging the transfer almost immediately : one by @entity156 and @entity157 and the other by @entity159			0
the district court consolidated the cases and eventually ruled in favor of the government			0
@entity156 , @entity157 and the @entity159 appealed , leading to friday 's ruling .			0

a cross has been atop @entity10 's @entity7 since 1913
*supporters* of the cross say it is the *centerpiece* of a war memorial
the appeals court saw no evidence of a war memorial until after lawsuits were filed
