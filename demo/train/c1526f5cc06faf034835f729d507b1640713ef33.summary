expect your @entity1 flight to be packed			1
nearly 24 million passengers are expected to fly this @entity1 travel season , an increase of about 150,000 passengers over last year , industry trade group @entity3 predicted			1
with fewer planes flying , airplanes could be close to 90 % full on the busiest travel days between friday , november 16 , and tuesday , november 27 , the trade group predicted			0
the busiest days are likely to be wednesday , november 21 ( 2.3 million travelers ) , sunday , november 25 ( 2.4 million travelers ) and monday , november 26 ( 2.3 million travelers )			0
despite reports that planes are going to be nearly full during the @entity1 holiday , some 78 % of travelers have not booked their airline , hotel or car rentals yet , according to a @entity21 survey released wednesday			2
do n't wait to book your flights " @entity1 airfare and hotel prices are up compared to last year , and they 're likely to increase even more as we get closer to the holiday , " @entity24 , president of the @entity25 , said in a statement			1
book now , advises @entity21 , because fares are only likely to increase			2

procrastinators take note : holiday airfares are up also consider booking at alternate airports that may offer lower fares			1
while travelers continue to complain about airlines charging for everything from more leg room to window seats to snacks , airlines would have lost money this year without those fees , according to @entity3 vice president and chief economist @entity51			2
jet fuel prices continue to rise although airlines have seen a 5.6 % increase in revenues in the third quarter of 2012 compared with the same time last year , @entity51 said that the 10 largest @entity60 airlines have also faced costs that are 6.2 % higher , reducing profits to a margin of 0.2 % -- or about 50 cents per passenger			1
without passengers paying an average of $ 8 each in ancillary fees on domestic , round - trip tickets , airlines would have been losing money , @entity51 said in a morning conference call			0
the price of jet fuel is a key factor in higher costs , he said			0
it has averaged $ 3.08 per gallon , more than last year 's record high of $ 3 per gallon			0
airlines have cut the number of flights and grounded some aircraft to reduce expenses			2
those cuts in domestic service are likely to continue into the new year , with @entity3 predicting a 2.4 % cut in the number of domestic airline flights and a 1.3 % cut in the number of domestic airline seats for the first quarter of 2013 , compared with the first quarter of 2012			1
