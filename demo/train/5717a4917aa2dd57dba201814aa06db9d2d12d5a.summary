-- vice president @entity1 delivered a rousing address to the @entity3 in @entity4 on thursday , bolstering support for president @entity6 and drawing sharp contrasts with the @entity8 on civil rights issues			1
on the heels of recent voter identification disputes , @entity1 strayed from his typical campaign speech to zero in on voting rights , arguing that @entity8 were making it more difficult for certain group to vote			1
by implementing laws requiring voters to present official identification at the voting booth , @entity1 said , the @entity8 sees " a different future , where voting is made harder , not easier			1
" @entity21 have said that such laws are politically motivated and intended to suppress minority voting , given that fewer people in minority groups carry government - issued ids			2
republicans , meanwhile , make the case that such laws prevent fraud and protect the integrity of the system			0
the issue was a hot topic this week at the @entity3 convention , where attorney general @entity35 spoke tuesday and lambasted states that have considered or attempted to implement such laws , including @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39			2
appealing to the group 's founding , @entity1 on thursday urged the crowd to " remember what ( the @entity3 ) at its core was all about			1
" " it was about the right to vote , because when you have the right to vote , you have the right to change things , " he said			0
he called on the crowd to imagine what the @entity52 would look like under a @entity55 administration			1
" imagine the recommendations and who he 's likely to pick for attorney general or head of the civil rights division , " he said , drawing scorn from the audience			1
the vice president also touched on a number of other issues , including energy , health care , women 's issues and education			2
in each instance , he compared @entity6 's policies with those of the @entity8			1
he particularly faulted the @entity8 for obstructing what he considers key legislation since @entity6 took office			1
" their discipline is amazing , they have never let up , " @entity1 said , referring to congressional @entity8			1
" but neither has my guy			0
he has not given up			0
he continues to be driven by the character of his convictions			0
" this was @entity1 's first time addressing the convention as vice president , the @entity3 said			1
" the vice president is a longtime friend to the @entity3 , " said @entity89 , the group 's chairwoman			2
" he has been a strong advocate for justice and equality over his decades of service in the @entity94 and the @entity95			0
" the president will miss the event because of a " scheduling conflict , " his campaign said			2
" we declined a few weeks ago , and ( the ) @entity3 was pleased ( vice president @entity1 ) was able to attend , " an @entity6 - @entity1 campaign official told @entity0			1
the president 's schedule for thursday initially appeared wide open , but a senior administration official confirmed thursday morning that @entity6 and the first lady will give an interview to @entity107 during the day			1
however , the president did make a brief appearance in a pre-taped video that ran before the vice president appeared			0
" if you keep standing with me ... i know we can arrive there together , " the president said after delivering a few lines from his typical stump speech on helping middle - class @entity116			1
@entity120 , the @entity3 @entity121 director and a senior vice president in the organization , said the @entity95 never confirmed a visit			0
" they were trying to work out something , " @entity125 said			0
as to why @entity6 could not attend , he added , " it was that something could not be moved			2
and unfortunately , they could n't move it in a way they could get him here this week			0
" @entity6 addressed the convention in 2009			2
last year , first lady @entity137 spoke to the group			0
@entity1 's speech thursday came one day after @entity55 was booed during his own remarks at the @entity3 convention , when the @entity8 vowed to repeal the @entity142 , @entity6 's signature health care law			1
in comparison , @entity1 drew thunderous applause after trumpeting health care reform and emphasized that the law ensures coverage to " 8 million black @entity116 who never would have had insurance			2
" the one time the crowd gave a negative reaction occurred when @entity1 began to close his remarks			1
he received a standing ovation from about half the audience at the end			1
meanwhile , @entity55 said the negative reaction he experienced wednesday did n't come as a surprise			1
" i think we expected that , " he said on @entity156			0
" i am going to give the same message to the @entity3 that i give across the country , which is that @entity142 is killing jobs			0
" two @entity163 - @entity163 members of the @entity164 found themselves split after @entity55 's appearance			2
" he gets credit for attendance , " rep. @entity168 , a @entity170 @entity169 , said on @entity0 's " @entity171			0
" " but perfect attendance does n't qualify you to be class president			0
i thought it was a good gesture to go , but i thought his content was lacking			0
" rep. @entity178 , a @entity8 from @entity179 , also said on " @entity171 " that he expects @entity55 to get about 10 % of the black vote come november , suggesting the @entity8 candidate 's focus should be on unemployment and home foreclosures			2
" @entity163 unemployment since 2008 is up 40 % , " @entity178 said			0
" home closures 25 %			0
so what we have is the same message that works for the rest of @entity116 , works for the black community , too			0
" @entity55 draws boos from @entity3 , support from conservatives @entity0 's @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 and @entity197 and contributed to this report .			1
