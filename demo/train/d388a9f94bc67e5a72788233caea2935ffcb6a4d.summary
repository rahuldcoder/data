-- i 've never really needed an extra ear			2
but theoretically , i suppose i could grow one with a @entity4 science printer and scare children in the park			1
" robots are taking all your future jobs ! you wo n't be better off than your parents ! @entity11 is becoming unlivable ! @entity12 ! " mind you , the ear would be back at home			2
but , yes , though it might seem crazy , we now know that this is possible , because a @entity20 artist named @entity21 has successfully " regrown " @entity23 's legendary severed ear			1
it 's a piece she calls " @entity26 , " and is on display at the @entity28 , where you can actually speak into @entity23 's ear with a special microphone , magically confessing all your secrets to the deceased artist			1
" @entity23 ... i 'm not wearing pants			1
" " sir , we know			0
" it 's been 126 years since the famous @entity40 painter supposedly hacked off part of his ear , but new technology and a little creative thinking managed to bring it back to life			1
here 's how it worked : when @entity21 came up with her idea , she originally wanted to procure some dna from an envelope that it was believed @entity23 had once licked			1
@entity23 , you may already be a winner			2
hot damn ! i got ta get this in the mail ! " however , it turned out that the dna was n't a match , so she found an actual modern day descendant of @entity23 , the great - great - grandson of his brother @entity63			1
which i 'm sure resulted in a rather awkward phone call			0
sooooo , i need some of your dna for this ... ear i 'm building			2
" this modern descendent would be @entity70 , who , it turns out , shares a y - chromosome and one - sixteenth of @entity23 's genome			1
in case you were wondering , @entity74 was not a match			0
but i 'm telling you he was n't a match			0
so , now they had some living cells from @entity83 ( pronounced : " @entity84 " ) , and that led @entity21 to the next step in the process , which was making a mold of @entity23 's ear with a @entity4 printer			1
the shape was modeled and designed by closely computing photos of @entity23			2
and it had to be photos			0
despite @entity23 's talent , for an accurate reading , his self portraits were just a little too post-impressionisty			1
next , @entity21 needed to get her hands on some cartilage cells			2
which , i assume , is not something you can do by , say , hitting up your local corner dope pusher or stopping into @entity107 's			0
" three bells ! " nevertheless , obtained cartilage cells were injected with @entity111 's dna and added to the @entity4 mold that had been created with a dissolvable sugar - polymer scaffolding			1
and there it sat , inside a bioreactor , for several weeks , where , as the scaffolding dissolved , the cells grew , strengthened , and filled in empty spaces			0
and then ( poof ! ) you had @entity23 's ear			1
so long as we have a very loose definition of what we are willing to consider @entity23 's ear			1
but we definitely had something			0
and while the ear now sits suspended in a nutrient solution in @entity20 , the plan is to move the display to @entity131 in 2015			1
by then , though , i 'm hoping we can add a few more famous missing parts to the exhibit , starting with @entity136 's right - hand middle finger			2
which just so happens to be the exact same missing digit as @entity140 mayor , @entity139 's			0
bet you did n't know that			0
) look , i 'm no artist			0
hell , i think @entity145 is one of the greatest cultural achievements in human history			0
but , that said , i 'm pretty sure a regenerated middle - finger - face - off between @entity136 and @entity139 would be worthy of its own room at the @entity152 next to @entity23 's ear			1
but good luck getting the genetics			0
sooooo , @entity139 , i need some of your dna for this ... middle finger i 'm building			0

a @entity20 artist @entity4 printed @entity23 's legendary severed ear
cells were used by the great - great - grandson of @entity23 's brother @entity63
the ear now sits in a nutrient solution in a *museum* in @entity20 , and will be on display in @entity131 in 2015
