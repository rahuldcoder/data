@entity0 , @entity1 -- " @entity4 train station ! " i say into the smartphone , which is running my voice through a translation app. i give the device back to the taxi driver			1
he reads the @entity1 display showing the app 's best guess of what i 've just said and then scratches his head			2
we left the hotel not five minutes ago but already he 's lost			2
with only hand signals and inaccurate electronic translation , the chance of reaching my destination , just across town , looks slim			0
and this is no isolated incident			0
more lost taxi drivers in fact , it 's the second time today i 've ordered a taxi with a local driver who has little notion how to get around the city he calls home			2
bizarre ? turns out there 's a very good reason for such confusion , and it 's not solely due to my inadequate language skills			0
it 's more to do with the complete transformation of the @entity41 district in @entity0 , home of the @entity42			1
such is the scale of the change it 's as if a new town has opened in one day			0
no wonder there are a few bemused cabbies on the streets			0
roads , bridges and railway lines according to the local government , the following developments have been completed in the @entity0 region in the past five years : 360 kilometers of new roads and bridges , 54 railway bridges totaling 16 kilometers in length , 200 kilometers of new railway lines , 22 tunnels , 480 kilometers of low - pressure gas pipelines , 550 kilometers of high - voltage power lines and two new thermal and one gas power plant that together produce more than 1200 megawatts			1
a new water and wastewater treatment facility processes 255,000 cubic meters of liquid per day ; a new seaport has been built to take two passenger liners , two ferries and 300 yachts			0
there are 60 new educational , cultural , sports and health facilities , and four ski complexes have been created ( @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 )			0
hotel capacity for the city has doubled to 50,000 rooms in the same period , with 56 of these hotels now rated four - star or above			1
regardless of political persuasion and aside from equations on value for money against investment , the ambition of the @entity0 project is so staggering it 's hard to believe until you see it			1
' of course there are drawbacks ' " @entity99 [ @entity0 's mountain resort ] has always been visited year - round but the @entity101 will help us make it popular around the world , " @entity97 , deputy chief of @entity0 's @entity98 , tells @entity2			1
given the extent of the development you could see how media complaints about their unfinished @entity101 hotel rooms , though justified , may have been a cause of frustration for anyone involved in the project			1
" of course there are drawbacks --- some of the hotels have been recently built			0
" if you would like to find the negative you will , " @entity97 tells @entity2			0
" in 2013 , about four million people visited us			2
" there have been fewer tourists during the preparation for the @entity124 -- we lost 10 % to 15 % -- but that 's natural			2
" when you make a renovation in your flat , you would n't invite friends , " as @entity97 puts it			0
too many hotel rooms ? @entity0 estimates that hotel capacity was at 79 % last year which , given all the new accommodation , raises the question : how are all those hotels going to be filled after the @entity124 ? for @entity97 the answer is simple : " chains such as @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 [ are now here and ] they will attract tourists			1
" we 're also launching a huge advertising campaign in @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147			0
" sport will remain a key marketing tool once the @entity101 are over			1
the @entity101 site will be the staging ground for @entity1 's first @entity152 , in october			1
@entity0 will also be one of the venue cities for the 2018 @entity155 , and it now has the infrastructure to stage many alpine and winter sport events			1
the theme park manager @entity160 , the avuncular @entity161 in charge of @entity0 's new theme park , recognizes the challenges but remains a keen advocate for the city			1
" [ in @entity169 times ] people came here because it was the best beach in @entity1 , but when the borders were opened everyone could travel to @entity147			0
" now we have to fight to get them back			0
" we have a quality product ... although attracting people from outside @entity1 ... will not be easy			0
" but let 's give it a try ! " previously managing director of the second biggest theme park in @entity147 , @entity160 has also been a @entity182 board member and head of @entity184 -- the five - yearly event where nations and large organizations show off their achievements			1
will tourists come ? given his experience , does he think enough tourists will come to provide a decent return on the theme park 's $ 700 million investment ? " we need to attract 1.5 million visitors annually to turn a profit			1
" the great thing about @entity0 is you have wonderful year - round weather , " he says			1
that lets the park stay open all day and into the evening			2
@entity0 residents say the city has just three seasons -- warm and humid summers giving way to long autumns that pass seamlessly into spring			1
market research by an @entity145 company predicted higher visitor numbers to the park than those needed to break even , @entity160 says			2
among its attractions are that it 's the only theme park in @entity1 outside @entity216 and it has one of the biggest looping roller coasters in the world			1
" they 'll come , " @entity160 says of future visitors			0
" i have a feeling about it ! " reimagining @entity1 @entity160 was unconvinced about moving to @entity1 for his new job , he tells @entity2 , a place he imagined as " dark , unfriendly and with lousy food			0
" seeing the ambitious plans for the theme park changed his mind			1
" @entity1 's time is coming			0
things are moving fast , " he says			0
" the culture is changing -- a new , more open generation is coming through			0
" my big surprise was that you can work together with @entity1			0
you can laugh , but they are actually a nice population ! " therein lies the essence of the @entity0 gamble			1
the @entity243 government hopes the city , as an open door to the rest of the world , will help to craft a strong and positive perception of this bear of a country			2
either way , tourists will be voting with their feet .			2

@entity0 hotel rooms doubled to 50,000 for the @entity101
new theme park cost $ 700 million
@entity0 is set to host @entity260 races from 2014 and will be a @entity155 city in 2018
but will tourists come ?
