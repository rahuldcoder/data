@entity0 -- a former high - ranking @entity3 official who was involved in the @entity4 has worked on an alleged ad hoc spy program that the @entity6 is investigating , @entity1 has learned			1
@entity7 -- who was pardoned for his alleged role in the @entity10 - era scandal by president @entity11 in the waning hours of his presidency in 1992 -- is using contacts in @entity14 and @entity15 to obtain information for the @entity6 , according to former government officials familiar with the current program			1
they declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue			0
the @entity6 has launched an assessment of the roles of at least three contractor companies with more than $ 20 million in contracts , according to @entity6 officials defense secretary @entity27 wants to know if bounds were overstepped			1
he needs " a factual baseline from which to determine whether or not systemic problems exist , " and how to fix them if they do , @entity6 spokesman @entity29 said tuesday			2
the two - week survey will be led by a small team of senior military and @entity6 officials , he said			1
the assessment was prompted by an investigation -- currently under way -- into a program led by @entity43 , a @entity6 official who oversaw contracts aimed at gathering information about @entity14 and @entity15			1
the program was meant to be limited to gathering what is known as " open - source information , " in which publicly available facts are gathered from , for example , local media and public events			2
some of the contractors with the program -- retired @entity3 officers and former military commandos -- may have instead hired local agents to gather information on the specific locations and movements of particular individuals and passed it along to military officials for possible lethal strikes , according to government officials and private - sector businessmen familiar with the investigation			1
federal laws and regulations generally prohibit contractors from directly engaging in intelligence collection because it is considered a crucial government function			0
the @entity6 is seeking to find out both whether the law was violated and whether funds were inappropriately diverted to conduct these alleged operations			2
" this is something that i need to know more about , but we do have reviews and investigations going on to find out what the story is here , find out what the facts are , and if it 's necessary to make some changes , i 'll do that , " @entity27 said monday			0
documents provided to @entity1 detail sensitive information that contractors gathered , including word of a meeting between @entity14 president @entity96 's brother and @entity97 , a top @entity98 leader who was arrested weeks later in @entity15			1
at another meeting with @entity98 commanders , an audio message from the reclusive leader @entity100 was played , in which he directed who would lead operations after a key member was captured			0
another document details the comings and goings at a safe house in @entity111 , @entity14 , used by suspected members of the @entity113			2
concern within the @entity3 about the contract played a role in prompting the investigation , according to officials			0
rear adm. @entity119 , a spokesman for the @entity121 - led force in @entity14 , told @entity1 last week that elements of @entity43 's project were not clear			1
" there was ambiguity about how they were going to collect information , " he said , and about whether @entity14 were to be used to do the work , and how the information might be used			2
" none of us were comfortable with what this contract meant			0
we wanted to know how they were going to glean information , " @entity119 said			0
@entity119 said he subsequently terminated @entity43 's effort last year because of his concerns			0
he estimates $ 6 million to $ 7 million of the funds allocated were spent and does not know what happened to the balance of the contract money			0
@entity7 , the former @entity3 official allegedly involved in the ad hoc spy ring , worked for the agency for 33 years , heading the agency 's @entity145 and @entity146 divisions and setting up its @entity148 in 1986 , according to a @entity150 review of his book " a @entity152			1
" he was indicted in 1991 on federal charges of lying to @entity155 and the @entity156 , which investigated the @entity4 , the review says			0
investigators said @entity7 was the man who put then - @entity159 col. @entity158 in charge of sending money and weapons to anti-communist fighters in @entity164 in the 1980s , in contravention of congressional mandates			0
@entity7 always maintained he was innocent , referring to the scandal as " the @entity4 nonsense , " @entity150 said .			1
