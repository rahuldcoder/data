-- @entity1 , the high - profile advocate of girls ' education in @entity4 and @entity5 , has been forced to defend his best - selling book " @entity7 : one man 's @entity8 and @entity10 ... one school at a @entity12 , " against charges that key stories in it are false			1
@entity1 shot to international fame with the book , which describes his getting lost in an effort to climb @entity19 , the world 's second - highest peak , being rescued by @entity5 villagers in the village of @entity24 and vowing to return there to build a school for local girls			1
he also claims to have been captured by the @entity28 and held for several days before being released			0
another best selling - author , however -- @entity30 of " @entity32 " fame -- told a @entity34 " @entity36 " investigation that aired sunday that the story is not true			1
" it 's a beautiful story , and it 's a lie , " @entity30 tells the program			2
" @entity7 , " co-authored by writer @entity44 , stayed on the @entity39 best - seller list for four years after it was first published in 2006 , becoming a global publishing sensation that has sold more than three million copies and been translated into 47 languages			1
@entity0 interviews @entity1 in 2008 @entity1 is also the author of the 2009 sequel " @entity47 : promoting peace with books , not bombs , in @entity4 and @entity5 , " which was another @entity39 best - seller			1
both books recount @entity1 's quest to bring schools to some of the remotest parts of @entity5 and @entity4 on the theory that education -- especially for girls -- is the best way to end the scourge of the @entity28 and other extremists in the region			1
@entity1 's publisher , @entity64 , modestly describes him as " a real - life @entity65			2
" @entity1 's quest to end extremism through education has made him a darling of the @entity71 military			1
a photograph in " @entity47 " shows @entity71 president @entity74 's top military adviser , @entity76 adm. @entity75 , opening a girls ' school in northern @entity4 with @entity1 in 2009			1
@entity30 is a climber and former donor to @entity1 's charity			1
@entity34 said he was one of @entity1 's earliest backers , donating $ 75,000 to his cause , but withdrew his support over concerns the charity was being mismanaged			1
he tells @entity86 investigator @entity85 in the sunday broadcast that a " close friend " of @entity1 's who hiked back with him from @entity19 says @entity1 never heard of @entity24 , the village he says he stumbled into , until a year after the failed climbing attempt			2
in a transcript of @entity1 's written responses to questions posed to him by @entity34 -- a transcript posted on the website of @entity1 's charitable organization , the @entity91 -- the author denies the claim is false			1
read more about the @entity91 at its website he says he did visit @entity24 in 1993 , after his failed attempt to climb @entity19 , but that the local people " have a completely different notion about time " than those in the @entity106 , implying they would not have been able to recount the exact year he visited			0
" @entity36 " also raised questions about the veracity of other episodes in the book , including his supposed 1996 kidnapping in the remote @entity5 tribal region of @entity114 , along the @entity4 border			1
that story is one of the more exciting episodes in " @entity7			1
" over the course of a chapter , @entity1 describes being kidnapped by @entity121 and detained in a makeshift prison by kalashnikov - toting guards for eight days , at which point he was suddenly released			0
in " @entity47 , " @entity1 even provides a photo of his kidnappers , 13 fierce - looking tribesmen , many of whom are clutching guns			0
@entity34 said it found four of the men in the picture and that all denied being @entity28			1
the network said the men provided another photo of the group with @entity1 , and in it , the author is shown holding an @entity137			2
the photos raise a question about the truth of @entity1 's claim that he was abducted			2
it is somewhat unusual for a group of kidnappers to pose for a photograph in which all their faces can be clearly seen			0
@entity147 , the former chief hostage negotiator at the @entity148 who has worked on 120 kidnapping cases , says it is " not common but not unheard of " for kidnappers to pose for pictures			0
one of the supposed kidnappers in @entity1 's photo is @entity155 , who directs a @entity5 think tank that specializes in research in @entity5 's tribal regions			1
( @entity155 has done research for the @entity159 , where @entity160 is a director			0
) contacted by @entity0 , @entity155 said @entity1 's account of his trip to @entity114 " is a pack of lies and not a single word of it is true			1
" @entity155 elaborated that @entity1 had come to @entity114 in 1996 with one of @entity155 's relatives and had stayed in the family village , @entity170 , for more than a week			2
rather than being kidnapped , @entity155 says , his family treated @entity1 as " an honored guest " and adds , " we were his protector in @entity114			0
" on his website , gregmortenson.com , @entity1 claims the kidnapping was carried out by the @entity28			0
however , the @entity28 had no presence in @entity114 in 1996 , only arriving in the region after their fall from power in @entity4 in the winter of 2001			1
the @entity28 had also banned photography at the time that they had supposedly kidnapped @entity1			0
in the transcript posted on the institute website , @entity1 stands by his claim of being " detained " for eight days in @entity114 in 1996			0
" it was against my will , and my passport and money were taken from me , " @entity1 says in the transcript			0
" i was not mistreated or harmed , but i was also not allowed to leave			0
a blanket was put over my head any time i was moved by vehicle			0
" he continues , " @entity197 ' means student in @entity199 , and yes there were @entity28 in the region			0
... some people are @entity28 , some are not , and affiliations change overnight , often on a whim			0
" friday , the @entity206 - based @entity1 gave an interview to the @entity208 in which he said , " i thought it best to befriend the people detaining me , " and added the men who had detained him may have perceived the episode differently			0
in an e-mail sent sunday to supporters , @entity1 says the " @entity36 " interview " paints a distorted picture using inaccurate information , innuendo , and a microscopic focus on one year 's ( 2009 ) @entity218 990 financial , and a few points in the book ' @entity7 ' that occurred almost 18 years ago			1
" @entity1 also issued a rejection of the " @entity36 " allegations in a statement issued friday by the @entity91 , in advance of the broadcast			1
" i stand by the information conveyed in my book , " @entity1 said			1
he also defended " the value of @entity91 's work in empowering local communities to build and operate schools that have educated more than 60,000 students			2
" he described @entity4 and @entity5 as " complex places torn by conflicting loyalties , and some who do not want our mission of educating girls to succeed			1
" @entity1 declined @entity34 ' requests for an interview and @entity0 has not been able to reach him			1
he says in the e-mail that he declined to appear on camera with @entity34 " after they attempted an eleventh - hour aggressive approach to reach me " and he decided they had a " disrespectful approach " that would result in an unfair and imbalanced report			1
" the ' @entity36 ' program may appear to ask simple questions , but the answers are often complex , not easily encapsulated in 10 - second soundbites , " @entity1 writes			2
his institute also said in a statement to @entity0 on sunday that he is not commenting in person because of a medical condition			0
" @entity1 has been suffering from hypoxia ( low oxygen condition ) for about 20 months , even though he still works nonstop			0
last friday , he was diagnosed with a tear hole in his heart wall that causes significant blood shunting and he will have a heart surgical procedure done on thursday to correct it			0
once his cardiologist allows he will be able to comment on his story in person , " the statement said			0
@entity1 's record of charity and his tales of derring - do have helped fuel the @entity91			2
the organization recorded income of $ 14 million in 2009 , the vast majority of which was raised from private individuals , many of them who were no doubt inspired by @entity1 's books			2
however , in 2009 , less than half of that money -- 41 percent -- actually went to building schools in @entity4 and @entity5 , according to the institute 's board of directors			1
on its website , the institute said " a significant portion of the remainder " was dedicated to the charity 's other programs , such as outreach and education about the need for the schools			1
the institute also says $ 1.7 million went to promote @entity1 's books in the form of advertising , events , film and professional fees , and some travel			2
it said the contributions generated by @entity1 's promotional events " far exceed the travel expenses			2
" @entity306 , president of the @entity307 , told @entity34 the institute has issued only one audited financial statement in the 14 years of its existence , and that it demonstrates a lack of transparency and " disappointing " intermingling of @entity1 's personal interests with those of his charity			1
@entity30 also said he has concerns about the finances of @entity1 's organization			0
" nobody is overseeing what goes on			0
he does n't know how many schools he 's built			0
nobody knows how much these schools cost , " he said			0
in the e-mail , @entity1 says he recently returned from @entity4 , where his organization plans to establish and built more than 60 new schools this year			2
he also says he is scheduled for surgery this week to fix the hole in his heart , and " after a few weeks my doctor says i will be as good as new			0
" @entity0 's @entity331 and @entity332 contributed to this report .			0

a @entity34 " @entity36 " investigation alleges the book 's stories are not true
the author says , " i stand by the information conveyed in my book "
" @entity7 " *spawned* a charity and efforts to *improve* girls ' education in @entity5 and @entity4
the book is an international publishing success
