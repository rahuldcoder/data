@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's high court has declared the registration of the country 's largest @entity6 party , the @entity5 , illegal			1
@entity5 is one of two main opposition parties and a constant thorn in the side of the ruling @entity12			1
with the declaration , @entity5 will not be able to take part in the country 's upcoming general election -- certainly welcome news to prime minister @entity18			1
opinion : @entity1 on the brink but such a ruling can also reignite a fresh round of political unrest in the @entity25 nation			0

and periodically , it will summon the masses to swarm the capital city , @entity0 , as a reminder			0

among those the court has convicted of crimes against humanity are several top @entity5 leaders			1
