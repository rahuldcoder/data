-- when @entity3 's two biggest soccer clubs go head - to - head in saturday 's @entity6 final , there can only be one winner : @entity9 industry			1
the @entity10 of @entity11 will look to rectify last year 's heartbreak on home soil against @entity14 when they take on a formidable @entity17 side that is seeking to emulate the club 's only success in @entity21 's top competition , back in 1997			0
some of the biggest talents in world football will be on show at @entity25 come kickoff at 1845 gmt in @entity26 , with the likes of @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 set to dazzle the crowd			0
but the all - @entity33 final could just be the sideshow to a bigger @entity9 act , as billion - dollar corporates gear up for one of the major advertising opportunities in world sport			1
from sportswear multinationals such as @entity42 and @entity43 to insurance giants @entity45 and @entity46 , @entity40 will be awash with the household names of @entity9 commerce -- all helpfully beamed to a global television audience of potentially 150 million			2
thousands of toxic yellow and crimson red jerseys will sport the names of @entity17 's sponsor -- chemical manufacturer @entity55 -- and that of @entity11 -- @entity56 -- as @entity21 's largest economy struts its industrial might on club football 's most prestigious stage			0
@entity3 , @entity21 's manufacturing powerhouse , is considered one of the economic bright spots of a continent dogged by recession despite the country posting growth of only 0.1 % in the first quarter of this year , driven mostly by consumer spending			0
despite low growth , @entity9 -- recognized as the best savers in @entity21 -- proved they were ready to flaunt their cash as @entity17 received a staggering half a million ticket requests for the final while @entity11 received 250,000			1
@entity25 can hold just 90,000 fans			0
football finance expert @entity77 said the final will provide a " brilliant showcase " for " @entity80 , " adding that the flair and style of the @entity33 as well as the wide array of homegrown talent on display will enhance the brands connected with the teams			1
" existing brand associations that many people around the world have with @entity9 products -- notably efficiency and quality -- will no doubt be reinforced , " @entity77 told @entity0			2
financial model of sustainability the ties between @entity9 industry and football run deep			2
unlike in @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 , where clubs are backed by @entity105 sheikhs , @entity107 oligarchs and @entity109 tycoons , the @entity9 league prefers a more homely approach to club financing			1
@entity112 , chief executive officer of the @entity33 and a self - proclaimed @entity114 fan , is skeptical as to whether the final will boost the national economy , but he does believe the game will be a good advert for @entity9 football			1
" @entity11 and @entity17 are proof that it is possible to have good sporting performance and to have solid financial behavior , " @entity112 told @entity0			0
unlike other top leagues which attract more global endorsers , the @entity33 clubs are largely sponsored by domestic brands -- 15 of the 18 clubs in @entity129 's top tier for the 2012 - 13 season were backed by local companies ranging from multi-billion - dollar insurance firms to family chicken and dairy farmers			1
" the big difference that you notice between other clubs in @entity21 is the degree of indigenous corporate engagement , " sports finance expert @entity135 told @entity0			1
even the stadia are part of the @entity33 's " @entity3 " philosophy			2
while fans of @entity146 or @entity147 would scorn at the renaming of @entity149 as the @entity150 or @entity151 as the @entity152 , regular rechristening is the norm for the 18 @entity33 teams			2
so the @entity155 -- home to @entity156 and located in the country 's financial heartland -- is named after one of @entity3 's biggest banks			0
@entity17 's @entity165 , once the @entity161 , and @entity11 's @entity162 -- both tagged by insurers -- serve as further examples of the close links with big business in @entity3			0
@entity77 believes branding stadiums reveals a consensus in football that is characteristic of @entity9 society and culture , where sponsor and fan cooperation is seen as for the club 's greater good			1
" this shows both a level of commercialism and a certain betrayal of history and heritage that some fans both in @entity3 and in other countries find unacceptable , " said @entity77			0
however , there is one fundamental rule for all @entity33 teams that ensures fans are not kept in the dark when it comes to the control of their club			2
the " 50 plus one " rule -- a revered model of football governance whereby fans are the majority stakeholder -- applies to all clubs participating in the @entity33 , with the exception of @entity201 and @entity202			1
those teams were founded by pharmaceutical company @entity201 and car manufacturer @entity204 respectively and are 100 % owned by these companies , with the stadiums -- @entity208 and @entity207 -- named in their honor			0
this is due to a rule that states if a club in @entity3 receives major financial backing from one party for over 20 years , that party can then take a controlling stake in the club			0
the boardroom structure in the @entity33 is unique and completely different to the big clubs in @entity100 , where a relatively small ownership group dominates the board			1
" the boards of these ( @entity9 ) clubs are packed with corporate heavyweights , " said @entity135			1
" it 's a confident assertion of @entity9 industry			2
" although @entity11 is owned by the fans , both @entity42 and carmaker @entity228 have 9 % stakes in the club , with the chairmen of both companies sitting on its supervisory board			0
in the case of @entity17 , 82 % of the club is free - float stock and owned by the fans but the corporate board is dominated by businessmen with backgrounds in banking and shipping			0
@entity33 boss @entity112 insists he is not concerned by the intimacy between big business and football clubs in @entity3 because the revenue generated by the teams pales in comparison to big multinational brands ' profits			1
" i do n't think they 're too close , " said @entity112			0
" the good thing is that the 100,000 jobs are created through the @entity33 in @entity3			1
" we 're talking about global brands and they 're using football as a marketing instrument all over the globe			0
" the strategy pursued by the @entity264 and the @entity33 after a poor showing at the @entity262 in 2000 has paved the way for the nation 's current success at both club and international level			0
" each club that wanted to play in the top two tiers of the @entity33 -- 36 clubs -- had to have a youth academy , " @entity112 said			1
" today more than â ‚ ¬ 100 million ( $ 128 million ) per year is invested and 5,000 players are educated in the program			0
" @entity276 , a scout for @entity278 club @entity277 who spent time observing the @entity201 setup , explained that there has been major investment by @entity33 clubs at grassroots level -- and players coming up from youth level are given more time to flourish than players in the @entity100 system			1
" @entity11 and @entity17 are very strong at youth level and that is behind their success , " said @entity276			0
" players are judged a bit later in the @entity33 -- instead of 17 or 18 , players can go right through to under - 21 level before they reach the first team			2
" given that co-ordinated strategy allied to long - term planning , no wonder " fussball " is coming home -- to @entity3 .			1

@entity6 final provides a " brilliant showcase " for " @entity80 "
@entity33 clubs have strong " indigenous corporate engagement "
expert : sponsor and fan cooperation is for the clubs ' greater good
like @entity9 businesses , @entity33 clubs pursue long - term planning
