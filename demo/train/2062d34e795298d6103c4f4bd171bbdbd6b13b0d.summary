-- " i 'm not concerned about the very poor			1
this was a bigger " oops moment " for @entity2 than when he said a few weeks ago that the $ 374,327 he earned in speakers ' fees over the course of 12 months amounted to " not very much			2
" it was bigger than " i like being able to fire people			0
" it was the biggest since he blurted out that corporations are people , my friend " at the @entity16			0
call it a @entity19 slip , call it overconfidence emerging from a big win in the @entity25 @entity24 primary , call it a classic , out - of - touch - sounding " @entity29 " gaffe			1
it may be all of those things , but this comment represents a scripted piece of the @entity2 campaign strategy			2
he hopes to co-opt an @entity37 campaign message aimed at appealing to the middle - class voters each will need in the general election			1
did his inept remark reflect a poor understanding of this position except as an election strategy ? one has reason to wonder			2
whether it 's policies that affect poor @entity47 , women , immigrants or the nation 's ever - shrinking middle class , one gets the uneasy feeling that the positions @entity2 recites are crafted for political gain rather than from a sense of conviction about what is good or bad for this country			1
why ? on abortion , for example , the former @entity60 governor supported the right to choose and a greater role for government in helping spread access to health care -- which won him votes in that liberal state			0
but he shed those positions when they would prevent him from attracting conservative republicans on a national stage			0
he has famously and repeatedly done similar turnabouts , most recently when he faced @entity25 's @entity75 primary voters with a kinder , gentler version of his previously anti-immigrant rhetoric			0
@entity2 taking heat for " poor " comments of course , a conservative political candidate trying to both woo a big - government - averse base and appeal to general - election moderates would focus on the middle class			1
we may even understand when particularly cynical politicians tune their strategies toward higher - income @entity47 , who tend to vote in greater numbers than lower - income folks			2
but what is far more puzzling is the reason @entity2 gave @entity0 's @entity94 for what sounded very much like callous disregard for the poorest @entity47			1
" i 'm not concerned about the very poor , " he said			0
" we have a safety net there			0
if it needs a repair , i 'll fix it			0
" actually , if you look at @entity2 's policy agenda , you will see that " fixing it " could not be further from his plan , unless it 's doublespeak for " eviscerating it			1
" @entity2 calls for immediate across - the - board cuts in nonsecurity discretionary spending			2
that would mean slashing the budget for many of the programs that comprise our safety net , by 5 % , according to his spending proposal			1
these cuts would come on top of the 17 % cut already affected by this summer 's @entity117			2
@entity2 : middle - income americans are focus , not very poor further , according to analysis from the @entity122 , his proposals to cap total spending at 20 % of gross domestic product , along with increasing already bloated military spending , cutting taxes and pursuing a balanced budget , would necessitate enormous cuts to vital programs			1
" the cuts would measure 21 % in 2016 and 36 % in 2021 , " the center said			0
" if policymakers exempted @entity134 from the cuts and then cut all other nondefense programs by the same percentage , the cuts would rise to 30 % in 2016 and 54 % in 2021			2
" @entity138 could all be gutted that helps low - income students afford college with @entity143 grants , enables low - income women and their children to eat a more nutritious diet , covers the cost of the highly successful @entity149 early - education program and pays for job training , housing assistance and veterans ' health care			0
in short , @entity2 's plan would incinerate the very safety net that he claims to be his excuse for expressing no interest in addressing the needs of the " very poor			1
" oh , and how poor are the poorest 5 % or 10 % of @entity47 he seemed to be referring to , exactly ? even the census , which tracks household income for all @entity47 , does n't say with precision , although it does note that households with annual income of $ 15,000 or less made up 13.7 % of our population in 2010			1
i do n't know about you , but i 'm concerned about them			0
if @entity2 's lack of concern about the very poor came with a real plan indeed to fix a tattered safety net so that poverty rates could begin to decrease , he might be less vulnerable to the charge of being out of touch with voters			1
but as long as his gaffes and policy prescriptions continue to belie either a lack of understanding of the economic plight of @entity47 or a cynical political calculation that both ignores and will exacerbate that plight , @entity2 will go the way of his fellow " oops " - prone 2012 presidential candidate			1
when he joins the ranks of the also - rans , do n't worry about him			0
given that his net worth is somewhere between $ 85 million and $ 264 million , if anyone in @entity47 has a " very ample " safety net to fall back on , it 's @entity2			1
join the conversation on @entity196			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			0

@entity199 : @entity2 's remark that he 's " not concerned about very poor " was telling
she says it 's classic @entity2 : out - of - touch , scripted to *pander* to middle - class voters
she says @entity2 's plans show safety - net programs would be cut in his administration
@entity211 : @entity2 should be concerned about nearly 14 % of @entity47 in poverty
