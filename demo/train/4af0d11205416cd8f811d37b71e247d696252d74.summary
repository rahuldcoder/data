@entity0 and @entity2 of @entity3 , @entity4 , camped outside the @entity5 overnight , hoping that when the sun rose monday , they 'd be the first same - sex couple to be legally married in the county			1
they arrived at 2 p.m. sunday and set up their tent			0
expecting a crowd -- of mostly media and friends , or their " chosen family , " as many of their kin do n't approve of their relationship -- they awoke at 5 a.m. monday to get dressed " so that when we got out of the tent we 'd look like a million bucks , " @entity0 said			0
@entity0 , 24 , and @entity2 , 21 , have known each other for seven years			0
they 've been dating for two			0
last year , the pair got " spiritually married " in @entity3 , but it was n't a state - recognized union -- where all the rights and benefits of matrimony are conferred on both partners			2
they previously considered going to a state that allowed same - sex marriage , but @entity2 balked at the idea			1
" we work here and we pay taxes here , and we did n't feel it was right that we 'd have to do that because nobody else does , " she said			0
though there were some minor computer problems in issuing their license , their wish soon came true			0
with one of their godmothers performing the ceremony , they exchanged vows outside the courthouse and kissed as a phalanx of media cameras captured the moment			0
( one of those cameras belonged to the @entity57 , a watchdog group involved in marriage equality advocacy ; @entity0 works for the organization			2
) @entity0 wept , while @entity2 did not			0
" one of us has to hold it together , " @entity2 quipped			0
@entity0 's tears were n't borne solely of the bliss that comes with being joined in union with your beloved			0
sure , those sentiments were there , @entity0 said , but she cried also because she had been thinking all night about the myriad couples who were denied the opportunity she and @entity2 were able to seize monday			0
" we have the honor to be the first couple in @entity5 to do this			0
it 's amazing , " @entity0 said , explaining the " overwhelming and overflowing love i have for @entity77 but also for people and the hope i have in my heart that this really means progress here			0
" though the @entity84 @entity83 and the @entity85 for the @entity85 of @entity4 cleared the way for same - sex marriages to begin monday in @entity4 , the famously conservative chief justice of the state @entity83 on sunday mounted a last - ditch effort to stop the weddings , instructing probate judges not to issue marriage licenses to same - sex couples			1
that did n't stop several couples from converging on county courthouses across the state			2
probate judge @entity100 in @entity101 , the state 's most populous , said there appeared to be a larger - than - usual crowd outside the courthouse when he arrived at work monday			2
state supreme court chief justice @entity106 , who was ousted from his first chief justice post in 2003 after refusing to remove a @entity109 monument from the @entity110 in @entity5 , wrote that his sunday order on same - sex marriages is necessary to ensure justice in the state			1
" effective immediately , no @entity100 of the @entity4 nor any agent or employee of any @entity118 shall issue or recognize a marriage license that is inconsistent " with the state code or constitution , @entity106 wrote in the order			1
the state code says " marriage is inherently a unique relationship between a man and a woman			2
" the @entity126 called @entity106 's order spurious and reminded @entity4 's probate judges they are sworn to uphold the @entity130 , which outweighs state law on this issue			1
" judge @entity106 has no authority to trump a federal court 's decision , " said @entity133 , executive director of the @entity126 of @entity4			1
" by issuing his ' order , ' he has done nothing but create confusion among the different probate offices across the state			1
whereas some counties are issuing licenses to same - sex couples , there are many who are n't			2
unfortunately , we have received a number of complaints to that effect			0
" the @entity57 has already denounced the order as a " clear violation of all codes of legal ethics , " and several counties -- including @entity101 , @entity5 and @entity156 -- have told @entity1 they intend to issue same - sex marriage licenses monday			1
but in @entity159 , where five same - sex couple were awaiting licenses when the court opened monday , chief probate clerk @entity158 said the court would follow @entity106 's guidance			1
" we will be issuing traditional marriage licenses , " she told @entity1			2
@entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 counties also are declining to issue the licenses , and in @entity172 , where two same - sex couples attempted to tie the knot monday , judge @entity171 said he , too , was " complying with an order from the chief justice late last night			1
" other probate judges were n't sure @entity106 had the law behind him			2
" i was shocked , " @entity100 said of his reaction to @entity106 's order			0
" i 'm old enough to remember the @entity181 stand in the schoolhouse door			0
i was a kid at the time			0
" @entity100 was referencing the 1963 attempt by then - gov. @entity181 to stop the federally ordered desegregation of schools by blocking black students from entering the @entity188 's @entity187			0
contacted before his court opened for the day , @entity100 said he does n't want to be on that side of history			0
after consulting with attorneys who helped him analyze @entity106 's order , " i 'm convinced it 's my duty to follow the @entity130 and the federal court order			1
at 8 a.m. , we will be issuing marriage licenses to all in @entity101			0
... i do n't think ( @entity106 's order ) is grounded in legal theory , just like gov. @entity181 in the 1960s was not grounded in law , " he said			2
gov. @entity204 said he would not punish probate judges who issue the licenses			0
in a statement that included a link to the @entity84 @entity83 's dissenting opinion but not the majority opinion that cleared the way for the marriages , the governor said he was disappointed " a single federal court judge disregarded the vote of the @entity4 people to define marriage as between a man and woman			1
" he added that he had " great respect " for the legal process and said , " we will follow the rule of law in @entity4 , and allow the issue of same sex marriage to be worked out through the proper legal channels			1
" anyone monitoring the situation in @entity4 likely expected @entity106 to try and block it			2
four days after a @entity84 district court judge struck down the state 's ban on same - sex marriages on january 23 , @entity106 hand - delivered a letter to @entity204 calling for him " to stop judicial tyranny and any unlawful opinions issued without constitutional authority			0
" the federal court that struck down the ban permitted a stay until monday to allow probate courts to prepare			1
@entity4 attorney general @entity241 asked the @entity84 @entity83 to block the marriages until the high court rules on a case on its docket that will decide the fate of same - sex marriages in four states			1
the @entity84 @entity83 said monday it would not intervene for now , making @entity4 the 37th state ( plus @entity250 ) to permit same - sex marriages			1
" in this case , the @entity83 refuses even to grant a temporary stay when it will resolve the issue at hand in several months , " justice @entity252 wrote in a dissent			1
" i would have shown the people of @entity4 the respect they deserve and preserved the status quo while the @entity83 resolves this important @entity261 question			1
" @entity241 responded in a statement : " in the absence of a stay , there will likely be more confusion in the coming months leading up to the @entity83 's anticipated ruling on the legality of same - sex marriage			1
" @entity241 further advised probate judges to consult with their attorneys " about how to respond to the ruling			2
" opinion : gay marriage is @entity4 judge 's latest battle @entity1 's @entity277 , @entity278 , @entity279 , @entity280 and @entity281 contributed to this report .			1
