-- @entity0 and the @entity2 's presentation of the @entity4 special feature , " @entity5 , " spotlight a serious issue affecting children across our nation			2
the film underscores the damaging consequences of bullying and the need to prevent and respond to it			1
lawmakers have a responsibility to ensure that our schools are safe , which is why i have made addressing this problem a priority in the @entity23			1
i firmly believe that all children have a right to an education free from fear of being bullied			1
the denial of this basic right is a betrayal of children who simply want to learn			2
@entity33 : say no to bullying the impact of bullying for students and for our nation are severe			2
in an era when a quality education matters greatly in a competitive global economy , students must be able to focus on their studies			2
bullying distracts students who worry more about surviving the day unscathed than about the grades on their report card			0
research has indicated that bullying causes increased absenteeism , dropout rates and academic underachievement , all of which undermine a child 's ability to succeed in the classroom and beyond			0
i am particularly disturbed by stories of bullied youth who feel powerless to change their situation and who choose not to seek help from adults			0
a recent report from a newspaper in my home state of @entity68 told the story of a 12 - year - old boy who regularly asks his parents not to report when he has been bullied because he fears possible retaliation			0
rather than speak up about the threatening environment at school , he felt that his only option was to keep quiet or risk making things worse			0
putting an end to bullying will require a consistent message from adults , including lawmakers , that young people can make a real difference in their lives and the lives of others when they speak up about bullying and harassment			1
recently , i reintroduced bipartisan legislation to help prevent bullying and harassment -- the @entity91			1
my bill , which i 'm proposing with co-sponsor sen. @entity93 , @entity94 , will require school districts that receive federal funding to develop codes of conduct that specifically ban bullying and harassment			1
this includes cyberbullying and bullying based on a student 's actual or perceived race , color , national origin , sex , disability , sexual orientation , gender identity or religion			0
at the end of the 112th @entity112 , 41 senators had joined senator @entity93 and me in supporting this important , commonsense legislation			1
a new study found that the psychological side effects of bullying can extend up to a decade after the harassment has ended			1
moreover , this elevated risk of mental health effects occurs not only with victims of bullying but also with the bullies themselves			0
faced with the possibility of such far reaching consequences , it is more important than ever that we put a stop to the intimidation of our youth			0
i applaud those who are already working to make schools a place where all children can achieve their full potential without fear of being bullied , and i urge my colleagues in @entity112 to work with me in passing the @entity91			1
watch the @entity136 special documentary , " @entity5 , " on march 3 and march 9 at 8 p.m. et on @entity0			0
