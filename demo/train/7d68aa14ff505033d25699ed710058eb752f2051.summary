you can dramatically reduce your chances of having heart disease or dying from heart disease if you do six simple things			1
that 's what a new study in the recent edition of the @entity9 found			1
and it 's good news since studies from the @entity14 found that heart disease is the leading cause of death for @entity19 women and men			1
this latest study used data came from 88,940 women between age 27 and 44 enrolled in the @entity26 from 1991 to 2011			1
the study looked at how many women smoked ( or quit ) , what their body mass index was , what their physical activity level was , how much they watched tv and what their diet was like			1
in 20 years of follow - up , there were 456 cases of coronary heart disease			1
researchers noticed that of the women who did n't have coronary heart disease and stayed healthy , the greater majority had six lifestyle habits in common			1
so , here is what you need to do			2
and while women were studied in this case , these habits would be good for men 's hearts , too			1
smoking does n't hurt just your lungs and age your skin prematurely , it also hurts your heart			1
in fact , nearly as many smokers die of heart disease as they do from lung cancer			1
smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the @entity19			1
the chemicals in cigarettes cause physical damage to your heart , and they mess with your blood cells			1
there 's a reason the @entity73 calls smoking the " gradual killer			2
" smoking can cause plaque to build up in your heart			1
that plaque narrows your arteries , making it hard for the blood to circulate			2
have too much plaque , and you 've got coronary heart disease			1
if you do n't smoke , do n't start			1
if you do smoke , ask for help			2
only about 4 % of people are able to quit without counseling or medicine , according to the @entity88			2
body mass index looks at your height and weight to measure how much body fat you have			2
researchers determined that optimal @entity94 was 18.5 to 24.9 , which scientists typically characterize as " normal weight			2
" a " normal weight " is probably a stretch for most @entity19			1
the average @entity94 is 26.5 for women , according to the @entity14			1
the next category could help			2
these women were n't at an hourlong exercise class class every day			1
they exercised at least 2.5 hours a week			2
that 's less time than most people spend in the shower each week			2
it 's not a high bar , but the study found even a small amount of physical activity made a real difference			1
what counts as moderate - to - vigorous - intensity exercise ? it means walking at a moderate or brisk pace , backpacking , hiking , bicycling , doing yoga , boxing , tennis or most any team sport			2
so get out there and get physical			2
a " healthy " diet was based on the @entity124			2
that 's a fancy term the @entity19 @entity127 's @entity126 came up with to determine how well @entity19 diets " conform to recommended healthy eating patterns			1
" what does that mean for you ? if you are active , you can eat about 2,200 calories a day and maintain your weight and still be considered healthy			0
if you exercise sometimes , try 2,000			0
if you have chosen to sit in front of the tv most nights , keep your diet to 1,800 calories			0
it 's not just about counting calories , though			0
you should be eating a balance of food from all the major food groups			0
if it 's been a while since you stared at one of those food posters in health class , that means : eat 2½ cups a day of vegetables , cooked or raw , or salads			0
eat two cups of fruit , raw or cooked			0
or it can come in the form of a cup of juice if it is 100 % fruit juice , rather than some sugary substitute your kids love			0
eat 6 ounces of grains			0
that could mean half a cup of rice or pasta or a slice of bread			0
eat three cups of dairy			0
it could be yogurt , 2 ounces of cheese , or drink a cup of milk or soy milk			0
eat 5½ ounces of protein			0
that means seafood or nuts or beans or peas			0
lean meat or eggs or poultry work , too			0
it may sound like a lot , but the good news is that your menu would have variety and give you a lot of options for meals			0
you 're not stuck eating only grapefruit or doing some crazy diet			0
that guideline is painful for someone who works for a tv company , but the good news is you do n't have to give up " scandal " and " @entity207 " completely			1
" limited " television is estimated at about seven hours a week or less			0
that means there 's room for " @entity212 360 ° , " too			0
earlier studies have found people who watch more than seven hours of tv tend to sleep less and weigh more			0
sitting for long periods disrupts your metabolism			0
too much sitting may kill you , new studies show			0
so , if you are going to watch television , at least do it standing or exercise a bit while watching			0
yes , you read that correctly			0
the women who avoided heart disease drank alcohol			1
the key , of course , is to be moderate about it			0
that was defined as about one drink a day for nonpregnant women			2
earlier studies have shown that women who do drink in moderation have a better chance than nondrinkers of staying healthy as they age			2
moderate drinking can reduce inflammation , promote healthy cholesterol levels , improve insulin resistance and help blood vessels function properly			0
the @entity14 suggests that you should n't start drinking for the health impact if you do n't drink already			1
there are a lot of extra calories in alcohol			0
@entity252 , the study 's lead author , said an important takeaway from the report is that women who followed just one of these six habits improved their chances of avoiding heart disease			1
" it is not do all or nothing to succeed , " said @entity252 , an assistant professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at @entity263 , @entity264			0
" even if you targeted one , two of these behaviors , your chances improve significantly			0
" the other takeaway , she said , is that you should start doing one ( or all ) these things while you are still young , long before you may show any signs that you could be heart sick			1
" people in their 30s and 40s often feel invincible and do n't feel they need to worry about heart disease , but that 's not the case , " she said			1
" we saw plenty of cases of heart disease in that category , not a huge number , but women did develop risks			1
" these are simple things women can do to avoid going in that direction			1

heart disease is the leading cause of death for @entity19 women and men , @entity14 says
study : majority of women who did n't have heart disease had six lifestyle habits in common
