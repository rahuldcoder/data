-- he 's only 26 years old but @entity2 has already achieved so much in @entity3 with four world titles under his belt and now a record - equaling ninth straight victory at the @entity8 @entity7 on sunday			1
the win capped a momentous season for the @entity11 and more are on the way , according former world champion @entity13 who says @entity15 's record of seven world titles is well within his grasp			1
" i think it 's hard to believe that he wo n't beat @entity15 's record , " the 1979 world champion told @entity0			1
" four championships in a row is incredible			0
i ca n't see him not beating the record			0
i thought nobody would ever beat that record			0
" the 63 - year - old @entity29 puffs out his cheeks when asked to name @entity2 's best performance			1
" all of them ! he seems to get out in front and stay there and pull away			0
he 's obviously magic , " says @entity13 before highlighting the technical nous required to be a champion			1
" it 's very technical , more than other sports , " he says			0
" you 've got to understand all the complexities of the car ... then you 're getting in that car , driving it fast , keeping it on the limit and not doing stupid things because that 's quite easy to do			0
" with so much to focus on , it 's easy to see why @entity2 and previously @entity15 might come across as being cold , methodical and big - headed , perhaps			1
but the characterization is n't necessarily fair , @entity13 says			1
" both @entity15 and @entity2 are concentrating on what it takes to win			2
sometimes from the outside it looks arrogant			0
i see it in a different light to other people , " @entity13 says			2
" the first thing is to win and the next thing is to be nice			0
@entity63 could always be nice , talk to everybody else and then ( still go on to win )			2
i was the complete opposite			0
" three - time world champion @entity63 , who spoke to @entity0 on the eve of the @entity8 @entity7 , thinks @entity2 's personality shines through in a different way			1
" he 's a very charismatic young man as far as i 'm concerned just because of his skill , " @entity63 said			1
" he 's very modest , he 's only 26 years of age and he 's the most mature 26 - year - old driver i 've ever seen			2
he 's had a sensational season			2
" yet despite his achievements , @entity63 hesitates to rank @entity2 alongside all - time greats like @entity76 's five - time champion @entity75 and scot @entity77 or more recent multiple champions @entity78 or @entity80			1
" you 've just got to wait and see what the future holds because he 's got a car that 's faster than anybody else 's right now and a designer ( @entity86 ) that 's probably the most brilliant in the history of motorsports			2
so he 's had a huge advantage			0
@entity2 , who also equaled @entity15 's record of 13 wins in a season with victory in @entity94 , will look to match his compatriot 's run of five straight world titles next season			1
@entity13 , for one , envisages a closer constructors ' championship in 2014 because of all the regulation changes , but he still ca n't look beyond @entity2 and @entity102			1
" i still would n't bet against them			0
i would have thought that some of the top teams would show up better going into the new situation and make it better			0
i 've been surprised by @entity108			0
