it is the first time @entity10 's semi-autonomous @entity9 region has officially exported oil out of the country			1
for years , the central @entity4 government in @entity23 has been at odds with the @entity9 , arguing they do not have the right to exploit oil in territory under @entity9 control			1
@entity9 officials have ignored @entity23 's warnings , and signed dozens of agreements with small foreign oil companies			2
the two sides finally reached an agreement on the issue last month			0
" i believe that the cooperation between northern @entity10 and @entity23 administrations is useful and beneficial for all			0
therefore this strategic cooperation will continue , " said @entity40 , the president of the @entity41			0

@entity9 officials and representatives from @entity57 , a @entity1 company working in @entity15 , said initially only 40,000 barrels of oil would be exported a day			1
