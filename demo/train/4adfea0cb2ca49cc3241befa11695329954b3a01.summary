-- the primaries are mostly over and the general election races are falling into place			0
all 435 seats in the @entity5 and a third of the @entity7 are up for election on november 4 in what 's expected to be a difficult year for @entity10			1
here 's what 's on the line : control of the @entity7 : that 's the big story of the year			1
@entity15 have their best chance of retaking the majority since they lost it in the 2006 midterms			1
the @entity15 must realize a net gain of six seats to accomplish the turnaround with @entity10 currently holding a 55 - 45 advantage ( 53 @entity10 and two independents who caucus with them )			1
and for @entity10 , it 's not looking good			1
@entity7 races three seats total in @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 are almost certain to flip to @entity15			1
and another seven @entity32 - held seats are at risk			2
in contrast , @entity15 have a chance of losing only two seats			1
" it 's a healthier environment overall for @entity15 , " @entity37 , senior editor for the nonpartisan @entity38 , said			1
the status of the @entity5 : @entity41 is expected to change in the @entity5			1
while some members will lose , it 's expected to remain in @entity15 hands			1
the @entity15 currently has a strong advantage : they control 234 seats to 201 for @entity10			1
what team would n't love a 33 - point advantage on game day ? @entity5 races like in the @entity7 , @entity15 are performing better			1
despite bold predictions from the no. 2 @entity52 , @entity54 , no one believes @entity10 have any chance of taking back the @entity5			1
" it looks like @entity15 will gain seats we just do n't know how many yet , " @entity57 , deputy editor of the @entity58 , said			1
why wo n't @entity10 pick up seats ? : in part , it 's the six - year itch			1
president @entity65 has been in office for six years and voters get antsy and want change			0
since they ca n't change the president , they vote for the opposing party in congressional elections			0
" historically , the president 's party tends to lose , " @entity37 said			0
@entity65 's job performance , an approval rating that hovers around 41 % , is making a tough situation for @entity10 worse			2
" the president 's job approval rating is casting a shadow on races across the country , " @entity57 said			0
@entity65 is a drag in two respects : it 's a difficult environment for @entity10 who need @entity15 voters in @entity15 - leaning districts , and @entity32 voters are not motivated to show up at the polls			1
the latter is called the enthusiasm gap and traditionally @entity32 voters , minorities , single women and younger voters , are not motivated to vote			0
the role of the tea party : @entity99 - aligned challengers had a tough year			0
unlike 2010 and 2012 , when several too - far - to - the - right candidates won in primaries , incumbent @entity15 entered the primaries prepared , taking nothing for granted			2
incumbents won in hard fought races , including in @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111			0
but the anti establishment wing of the @entity15 did n't come up empty			2
one of its victories was a big one -- the defeat of @entity5 majority leader @entity116			1
after bruising battles , the question is this : will @entity15 unite in november ? @entity37 said that if 2012 and 2010 are indicators , it will			1
" what we can see ... they have united behind whoever won , " @entity37 said			0
" i do n't think at the end of the day ( disappointed @entity15 are ) going to stay home			2
" a bright spot for @entity10 ? : when it comes to gubernatorial races , @entity15 are defending 22 of the 36 seats up for grabs in november			1
and some of them are in states that @entity65 carried in 2008 and 2012 , such as @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140			0
but @entity10 also have some vulnerable seats to defend , in @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144			1
and they wo n't have cakewalks in @entity147 and @entity148 key governor races still about @entity150 : for the first several months of the year while the @entity150 seemed to be a rolling disaster , @entity15 made it the main issue in campaign , attacking democrats for their support of the law			1
@entity158 , senior vice president with @entity159 , which analyzes political advertising , said that @entity15 are still hitting @entity32 opponents on @entity150 but it is not the only one			1
" @entity164 is still an issue , but maybe a bit less of an issue than earlier this year , " she said			0
in addition to the @entity150 , republicans are also attacking democrats on ties to the president and government spending			2
in political advertising , democrats are trying to change the subject and are focusing on jobs , women 's rights , @entity179 and @entity180			0
regardless , @entity158 said analysis shows that up to $ 3.4 billion is expected to be spent on political advertising this campaign season			0
current events : a border crisis and international conflicts are dominating the news cycle just a few months before the election			0
while the storylines are n't overwhelming topics of discussion on the campaign trail , @entity58 , editor of the @entity58 wrote that the events " will add to the president 's woes			0
" " as uncomfortable as it will make @entity10 , @entity65 heads into the final three months of the campaign not looking all that different from his predecessor , president @entity197 , " he wrote			2
@entity197 was dealing with a difficult economy , ongoing and unpopular wars and the aftermath of a disastrous response to @entity202			2
the role of the money men : and yes , the biggest spenders are men			0
since the @entity212 's @entity211 campaign finance decision in 2010 , the role of individual investors in the political sphere has grown			0
wealthy entrepreneurs @entity213 and @entity215 spent $ 130 million in 2012 through their organization @entity216 , which works to defeat @entity10			2
they also donated money directly to candidates and political action committees as well			0
a wealthy former hedge fund manager , @entity222 , hopes to play big as well			2
focusing on climate change , he pledged to spend up to $ 50 million of his own money and hopes to raise another $ 50 million			0
we 'll have to wait and see how the high rollers play in the midterms -- that is if we ever find out because much of the spending does n't have to be made public			0
opening act for 2016 : let 's face it , the midterms have n't even happened yet but the 2016 presidential race is well under way			2
potential presidential hopefuls are already spending large amounts of time in early primary states of @entity238 , @entity239 and @entity240 and building networks by backing candidates in critical presidential states , in hopes that the favor is returned in 2016			0
complete coverage : 2014 @entity247			0

control of the @entity7 is the big story of the midterms
@entity10 face a difficult task of maintaining their majority
@entity15 *success* could be determined , in part , by outrage over @entity150
