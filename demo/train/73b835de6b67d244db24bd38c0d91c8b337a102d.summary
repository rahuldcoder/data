-- everyday @entity1 now have the power to advise congressmen and influence legislation through @entity5 , a new online platform that implements public suggestions on pending laws			1
here 's the kicker : it was designed by a @entity11			2
thanks to their pioneering use of the @entity15 to raise money and mobilize supporters in the 2004 and 2008 presidential campaigns , @entity12 have gained a reputation in recent years as being ahead of @entity11 in embracing digital tools			2
witness 2008 @entity11 presidential nominee @entity23 's public comments about his unfamiliarity with e-mail			2
but since 2010 , conservatives have actually begun to outrank their @entity28 rivals as technology trailblazers			0
from introducing a social network for crowdsourced legislation to their recent show of strength on @entity34 , @entity11 have made strides to rid themselves of the luddite label			1
perhaps the most impressive display of their new tech - savvy direction is @entity39 , the nickname for a crowdsourcing platform that allows citizens to amend individual passages of legislation by adding or striking language			2
citizens are encouraged to like or dislike each change , with the most popular suggestions rising to the top			0
additionally , individual users and organizations must reveal their identity , so the source of every suggestion is transparent			0
" technology should reduce the size of government , " @entity56 's creator , rep. @entity55 , @entity57 , told me recently after launching an effort to expand @entity5 to the entire legislative docket			1
" transparency tells us where government is building up bureaucracy			0
" the language of small government , reduced regulation , and transparency has helped galvanize conservatives to support the use of technological tools and technology - friendly legislation			2
@entity55 and @entity77 majority leader @entity76 were influential in boosting a massive online protest against the regulation - heavy @entity79 , which would have penalized websites that host pirated content and faced near - unanimous opposition from the technology industry			1
@entity76 also appointed a separate technology communications director , @entity86 , who , among many projects , helped launched @entity88 , a digital platform that allows the public to choose which federal programs @entity11 will propose to cut			1
" because technology has the potential of making government more efficient , less expensive to run , and more accountable , it 's not surprising that the @entity11 are ahead of the @entity12 in the use of technology in governing , " says @entity92 , founder and publisher of @entity95 president , a blog about the intersection of politics and technology			1
while both parties in @entity109 have generally agreed on transparency issues , such as a 72 - hour online viewing window before laws are passed , these digital tools of direct democracy have recently been a signature pursuit of @entity11			1
the glacial speed of @entity109 can make it difficult to assess the impact of technological advancement , but there are signs these tools are making a difference			0
@entity55 's proposed alternative to @entity79 , the @entity123 , adopted some specific suggestions from the online community through @entity5 , including a provision to protect owners of a website domain name from the illicit actions of the person who runs the website			1
and the @entity132 , a @entity11 - led bill to let citizens track federal spending online , has passed the @entity77			1
this @entity11 commitment to technology has extended to social networks as well			2
a recent study by @entity140 found that @entity11 members of @entity109 use @entity34 more effectively than their @entity12 counterparts			1
according to the study , conducted over nearly four months in late 2011 , @entity11 lawmakers had nearly twice the @entity34 interaction -- mentions , replies , and retweets -- as did @entity12			1
a study by the @entity149 , examining the 2010 midterm elections , found similar results			0
it concluded that " conservative candidates used this medium ( @entity34 ) more effectively , conveying a coherent message and maintaining a dense graph of connections			2
" the authors of the @entity149 study also praised what they saw as impressive consistency across the messages of the @entity165 , the grassroots small - government movement that has managed to unseat powerful @entity11 incumbents such as sen. @entity160			1
meanwhile , the left - leaning @entity167 movement has been criticized for an incoherent agenda and is sputtering towards political oblivion			0
@entity11 have made a concerted effort to beef up their social - media presence since 2008 , in part by recruiting tech - savvy staffers to train members of @entity109 in how to use social networks			1
unfortunately for them , these digital - messaging skills have n't always spilled over into general campaigning			0
president @entity179 's re-election team has hired an army of @entity181 to construct the " dashboard , " a so - called @entity183 of campaign tech that orchestrates volunteer canvassing in real time			0
the system relays crucial data back to a team of statisticians , who then can reroute the entire organization to optimally target malleable voters			0
when it comes to the liberal tradition of grassroots organizing , @entity12 still may have a home - field advantage			0
yet when it comes to actual governing , republicans have shed their luddite stereotype			1
this means @entity12 have a reason to up their game as well			0
let 's hope these innovations spark a high - tech arms race that will raise the bar for how @entity1 is governed in the 21st century			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity210 .			0
