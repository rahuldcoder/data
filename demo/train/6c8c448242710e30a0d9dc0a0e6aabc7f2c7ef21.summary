-- filipinos are used to typhoons			2
i grew up in the @entity4 knowing it has two seasons -- the " wet " and the " dry			2
" more than 20 typhoons whip through the @entity8 in a year			1
i could smell the rain when it was coming			2
i knew that if the moon had a ring around it , there would be rain the next day			2
i knew that the excited twittering of birds also meant rain was coming			1
at a young age , i could gauge just how strong the typhoon was , not only based on the storm signal warnings , but on how thick and dark the clouds were , how heavy the rain fell , how strong the wind blew			1
it became instinctive to know how dangerous a storm was			0
in @entity27 , where i grew up , a siren would blow the warning signals when a typhoon was approaching			0
storm @entity30 meant rain and some wind , but we still went to school			1
no. 2 meant stronger rain and wind			1
we were excused from school , but it was safe enough to go to the movies or to a friend 's house			1
we would also listen to announcements on the radio			0
we knew a storm was coming , but the radio news gave us an inkling of its severity			0
we took @entity50 and 4 seriously and stayed indoors because it meant the rain and wind were very powerful			1
the streets would flood ; branches of trees could break ; trees could be uprooted , corrugated metal roofing could come loose and fly about , electric power lines could break			0
it was dangerous to be outside			0
we stayed home with canned goods , water , candles and matches , because it was a given that electricity and telephones would be cut off during typhoons			0
we waited out the storm in the safety of our homes			0
that 's how it is ; that is what the @entity8 expect and do when a storm is coming			1
even before the @entity79 media started focusing on super typhoon @entity80 , i 'd been following the news on the @entity83			1
friends in @entity27 , @entity4 , who had just been battered by the 7.1 magnitude earthquake last october 15 , were giving me a blow - by - blow account as they hunkered down and waited for @entity80			1
after the super typhoon passed , someone jubilantly e-mailed , " we survived			0
" @entity90 pictures were posted of the damage in @entity27 , which did n't look too bad : streets littered with debris , trees uprooted , cars flipped over on their sides , some roofing damaged , store signs askew			0
and so for a few hours at least , a sense of relief washed over me -- until a friend received a text message from the parish priest of @entity105 in @entity27 : " @entity107 no more roof and ceiling			0
95 % of parishioners homeless			0
" deep inside , i had known that a country ca n't get away unscathed when a super typhoon like @entity80 hits it , and the text from @entity119 brought me back to reality			1
as communications resumed , the world understood the awful destruction that @entity80 had wrought in @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity27 , and other parts of @entity4			1
it has been painful to see images of villages destroyed , of people wandering around in the midst of all the rubble , of survivors holding up signs begging for food and water			0
what i find most nerve wracking are the pictures of the dead lying by the roadside or under rubble			0
@entity8 have much respect and love for their dead , and so these images indicate just how desperate survivors are that they ca n't take the time to bury their loved ones			1
i ca n't help but wonder what went so wrong			0
why were @entity8 caught off guard ? why did n't the government plan better for @entity80 -- or @entity152 , as the super typhoon is called in the @entity8 ? why have so many people died ? why are survivors left on their own ? i have no doubt that the survivors and victims of @entity80 had done their part : like they always have , they had stocked up on basic necessities and hunkered down in the safest place they could think of			1
but here 's the thing : even though @entity8 knew that @entity80 was the strongest typhoon in recorded history to make landfall , they did not have the collective memory of something this powerful			1
no one expected the great destruction of @entity80			2
no one expected its 15 - to 20 - foot tsunami - like surge			0
here 's the irony : many people died in the evacuation centers or gymnasiums or churches where they sought refuge , from drowning and from the buildings collapsing			2
here 's a fact : the death toll will rise because the @entity4 has 7,100 islands , and in those islands , many coastal villages have not yet been accounted for			0
now , @entity80 will never be forgotten			2
the super typhoon is part of the @entity8 ' collective memory , when before , it was unimaginable			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			2

@entity197 grew up in the @entity8 ; where people deal with about 20 typhoons a year
she says @entity203 meant rain and some wind ; 2 was no school , 4 was hunker down
everyone took *shelter* as usual , she says , but @entity80 was beyond anyone 's experience
@entity197 : now , @entity152 will haunt @entity8 ' collective memory
