@entity0 -- an immigration proposal crafted for months in secret by a high - profile , bipartisan cadre of senators is both a rare moment of simpatico in politics and a matter of political practicality			1
president @entity10 , who won re-election with strong support from @entity13 , the fastest - growing demographic , has called an overhaul of immigration a second - term priority			2
meanwhile , @entity18 who lost the @entity20 vote by large numbers , have signaled that mainstream members might be willing to compromise on thorny immigration issues			1
" there are n't a whole lot of other issues where @entity18 think they need to compromise or @entity29 think they need to compromise , " said @entity24 , a government professor at @entity25			1
" there 's two different ways this could be viewed this			0
it 's either a @entity35 moment ... or both sides see that on this particular issue there 's a necessity for compromise			1
" but the deal is far from done			2
the plan could face stiff opposition in the @entity44 , where conservatives and tea party leaders have resisted any compromise that even hints at relief or amnesty for those already in the country illegally			1
@entity44 @entity18 are also working on a plan of their own , seeking bipartisan support			1
and @entity10 is said to have drafted his own detailed plan , which could differ from the @entity56 proposal in key areas , including border security and a path to legality			1
@entity10 to pitch immigration reform today in @entity61 the senators announced their plan a day before @entity10 speaks in @entity61 on immigration , signaling a major push by both sides to focus on the contentious issue in the new @entity68			1
aides said the president 's remarks on tuesday will touch on the blueprint he 's detailed in the past : improving border security , cracking down on employers who hire undocumented workers and creating a pathway to " earned " citizenship for undocumented immigrants			2
those provisions align closely with what the eight senators laid out in a framework of their legislation , which @entity1 obtained sunday			2
possible compromise on immigration takes shape @entity10 previously came under criticism from @entity20 activists for failing to deliver on a 2008 campaign promise to make immigration reform a priority of his first term			1
last year , as the campaign heated up , the @entity10 administration announced a halt to deportations of some young undocumented immigrants in a move that delighted the @entity20 community			0
exit polls in november indicated @entity20 voters gave overwhelming support to @entity10 over @entity18 challenger @entity106 , who had advocated a policy that amounted to forcing undocumented immigrants to deport themselves			1
since the election , mainstream @entity18 leaders and some conservatives such as sen. @entity111 , a child of @entity113 immigrants and a rising star in the party , have called for addressing the immigration issue instead of ceding the @entity20 vote to @entity29			1
" there is a new , i think , appreciation on both sides of the aisle -- including maybe more importantly on the @entity18 side of the aisle -- that we have to enact a comprehensive immigration reform bill , " sen. @entity119 , @entity120 , said sunday			1
" we are losing dramatically the @entity20 vote , which we think should be ours , for a variety of reasons , and we 've got to understand that , " @entity119 told @entity133 's " @entity132			2
" @entity119 is one of the eight senators proposing the compromise			1
four are influential @entity29 , while @entity18 joining @entity119 in the effort include tea party - backed newcomers @entity111 of @entity138 and @entity139 of @entity120 -- two states where immigration is a major issue			1
democrats pointed to the proposal monday as an example of bipartisan cooperation			0
" i 'm glad to see that there is bipartisan agreement among my colleagues regarding the principles of immigration reform , " sen. @entity147 of @entity148 said in a statement			2
" @entity148 residents are particularly interested in getting this done			0
our state is an example of how our immigration system can work			2
we are a people of many stories and cultures , and our state is stronger because of the thousands of immigrants like me who have made @entity148 their home			0
" the @entity167 also hailed the effort			0
" for many years , the @entity167 has pushed for a permanent , legislative solution to our ineffective and unjust immigration system , and we believe 2013 will be the year this goal becomes reality , " rep. @entity169 , @entity170 , the caucus chairman , said in a statement			2
" the @entity56 's blueprint is a positive step toward this important goal , and we look forward to reviewing the details with the @entity56			0
their ' tough , but fair ' approach provides a good foundation for the legislation that is needed			0
according to a @entity1 / @entity185 poll conducted this month , 53 % of those polled said allowing illegal immigrants to become legal residents should be the main focus of @entity190 policy , compared with 43 % who said the focus should be on deportation and curbing illegal immigration			2
those figures have flipped from 2011 , when 55 % of those polled favored deportation and nixing illegal immigration as a domestic policy focus and 42 % said they favored a pathway to citizenship			1
still , the immigration overhaul proposal faces partisan obstacles			0
opinion : @entity190 needs 21st century immigration plan shortly after the immigration compromise was announced , conservative groups and lawmakers made it clear that they would oppose such a measure			1
@entity211 , a group seeking to reduce @entity190 immigration , called the @entity56 plan an attempt to " out - amnesty @entity10 " and said it was activating its 1.3 million members to push for congressional opposition			1
" no one should be surprised that individuals who have supported amnesty in the past still support amnesty , " said rep. @entity216 , @entity217 , a former chairman of the @entity218 who serves on that chamber 's immigration subcommittee , in a statement			0
" when you legalize those who are in the country illegally , it costs taxpayers millions of dollars , costs @entity190 workers thousands of jobs and encourages more illegal immigration			0
by granting amnesty , the @entity56 proposal actually compounds the problem by encouraging more illegal immigration			0
" the bipartisan compromise is encouraging , but several questions remain , said @entity239 , a longtime political analyst and co-author of " it 's even worse than it looks : how the @entity190 constitutional system collided with the @entity243			0
opinion : stars align at last for immigration plan " one , will this compromise make it through the @entity56 , once the details are hammered out ( always more difficult than frameworks ) and with a lot more than 60 votes ? two , will @entity253 , who have very different impulses and constituencies , be supportive ? three , if not , will ( @entity258 ) @entity257 bring an immigration bill to the floor that will get many more @entity29 votes than @entity18 ? " @entity239 said			1
other @entity56 - led bipartisan efforts have faced similar chances of success			0
proposals to resolve the debt crisis -- including the so - called super committee -- failed			0
the nation was able to avert the fiscal cliff narrowly thanks , in part , to the bipartisan efforts of senate minority leader @entity272 and vice president @entity273			0
but political experts said that on immigration , there might be more room to meet in the middle			2
still , for his part , @entity257 was noncommittal			0
" the speaker welcomes the work of leaders like sen. @entity111 on this issue , and is looking forward to learning more about the proposal in the coming days , " @entity257 spokesman @entity280 said			0
@entity1 's @entity287 and @entity288 contributed to this report .			0

immigration plan a *product* of compromise from senators on both sides
experts say @entity29 want a deal and @entity18 need a deal
but plan may face resistance in @entity44 , where conservatives *lament* path to citizenship
there , leaders will need to lure most @entity29 and many *republicans* to vote for it
