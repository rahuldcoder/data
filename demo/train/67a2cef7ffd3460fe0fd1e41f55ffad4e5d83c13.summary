-- the student debt fight is back -- with a vengeance			1
once again , current students are facing the possibility of interest rates on @entity7 student loans doubling			1
once again , we are asking what our leaders are doing about a crisis that gets worse every year			2
once again , the answer is : not much			0
that is a huge problem -- and not just for millennials , or young people born between 1980 and 2000			0
the approximately $ 1.1 trillion in student debt out there already constitutes a crisis for every one of us			1
it is the only form of household debt that has continued to rise during the @entity23			2
it is also the only form of debt that can not be discharged under bankruptcy or even death , as parents who have lost children have discovered to their horror			2
it is preventing young people from buying homes and starting businesses			0
in short , student debt is a $ 1.1 trillion anvil dragging down the entire @entity38 economy			1
unfortunately , the conversation in @entity40 is not about big fixes , but simply how to avoid making matters worse by letting interest rates rise			1
last year , the interest rate on federal @entity46 student loans was set to double from 3.4 % to 6.8 %			1
there was a massive outcry from students and organizations like my own , @entity52			2
perhaps fearing young people 's electoral clout , @entity53 kicked the can down the road a year			1
so here we go again : last week , president @entity59 waded back into fight , urging @entity53 to prevent the rate hike scheduled for july 1			1
but this year , something is different : sen. @entity63			1
a few weeks ago , @entity64 , @entity65 , proposed groundbreaking legislation that would give students the same deal that big @entity70 banks get			1
this bill is good policy , and even better politics			1
after all , why are we loaning money to mega-profitable international financial institutions at 0.75 % , but demanding up to nine times more from our own young people ? by comparison , the otherwise ideal @entity80 proposal for a two - year extension of the current 3.4 % rate is simply not as ambitious			1
unfortunately , the proposals with the most energy behind them are worse than both these options			0
@entity88 , the @entity59 administration , and a number of senators are all pushing to permanently tie the rate for student loans to the government 's borrowing costs			1
it may seem commonsense , but the devil is in the details			0
for instance , the @entity100 plan passed recently is just plain bad for students			2
interest rates on july 1 would actually be higher than 6.8 % for some borrowers , and vary wildly and unpredictably over the lifetime of the loan			1
the government would mark up the costs 2.5 % to 4.5 % , based on the type of loan			2
the profit would pay down a deficit young people did not create , instead of funding education			0
the @entity59 plan , by contrast , has better terms for borrowers and would offer fixed - rate loans that will not suddenly spike in cost			2
but it lacks any cap on how high interest rates can go , and continues the worrying practice of the government profiting off student loans			1
as for borrowers who already have loans ? sen. @entity128 , d - @entity129 , has proposed allowing students to simply refinance their old loans at today 's historically low rates			1
it is almost shocking that you can not do this already			0
@entity139 @entity138 rep. @entity136 would make repayment fairer and easier			0
young people should be rallying behind the @entity64 , @entity143 , and @entity128 bills			0
but they can and should demand a whole lot more			0
the problem is not just that the cost of borrowing could go up			0
the real problem is the skyrocketing cost of tuition that is forcing students to take on unmanageable levels of debt in the first place			2
it is in our leaders ' own best interests to do something about that			0
after all , millennials will make up one - third of eligible voters in 2020			0
it is no accident that the two best @entity166 bills were introduced by senators -- @entity64 and @entity128 -- who have been rumored as future presidential candidates			0
but at the end of the day , this is not a student issue			0
it is not a youth issue			0
this is a corrosive crisis that touches your life whether you know it or not			0
if you live in the @entity38 , this is your issue			0
the student debt fight is back -- and it is not going away any time soon			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity183 .			2

interest rates on @entity186 issued after july 1 are set to double to 6.8 %
@entity183 : the $ 1.1 trillion in student debt out there already creates a crisis for all of us
he says , unfortunately , @entity53 is not looking at big fixes but rather @entity196 fixes
@entity183 : sen. @entity63 's proposal to give students lower interest rate is good policy
