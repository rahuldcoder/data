-- @entity1 might be the biggest country most of the world does n't know a whole heckuva a lot about			1
this is beginning to change as financial fortunes for some have soared in recent years , helping lift some 50 % of the country into the middle class			0
of this figure , 40 million were added to the middle class between 2004 and 2010 , under the government of president @entity13			0
but success has n't come without problems			0
the mass june demonstrations over chronic economic disparity and dissatisfaction with the federal government united poor and middle classes alike , exposing a troubling social reality			2
still , if there 's one thing @entity1 is known for worldwide it 's a gregarious and energetic population			1
@entity26 's coolest nationalities : where do @entity1 rank ? now that @entity1 will be hosting the @entity29 next year and the @entity30 in 2016 ( massive public expenditures that many here deeply oppose ) , it 's time for a crash course in all things @entity1			1
there are no introverts in @entity1 or at least none you can find without a private detective			1
it 's a vivacious culture that can bring you out of your shell , help you unwind and have the best time of your life			2
it can also jack up the decibel count			0
@entity1 like to express themselves and do n't have many restraints on the volume with which they do it			1
that goes not just for conversation , but car horns , tv pitchmen and sound trucks blasting advertisements through the neighborhood from 16 speakers			0
@entity55 is n't spoken widely as @entity58 speakers on a @entity60 continent far from the @entity55 - speaking world , @entity1 have been a linguistic universe unto themselves			1
not many @entity1 speak @entity55 , particularly outside @entity62 or @entity63			1
they 've seen all the @entity65 movies and know all the @entity67 songs , but the premium has traditionally been on getting a good education in @entity58 , still difficult in a land where education is far down the list of priorities			0
@entity1 are hospitable , though , and most will figure out a way to communicate			1
it 's helpful to come prepared with a good phrasebook			2
key phrases to master : @entity81 bom ? ( how are you ? all good ? ) , @entity80 nao entendo ( i do n't understand ) and futebol ( you 'd better know this by now )			0
if all else fails , go with the all - purpose @entity1 sign that everything is cool : stick both thumbs in the air and pump them up and down			1
ahead of the @entity1 @entity29 , free @entity55 classes planned for prostitutes the juice bars are amazing maybe because they 're surrounded by so many varieties of exotic fruits the rest of us have never heard of -- caju , camu - camu , pitanga -- @entity1 are experts in the creation of especially tasty fruit drinks , or sucos			1
just about every other street in @entity62 has a juice bar			0
even delicatessens whip up outstanding juices and smoothies , such as graviola , which comes from the spiky , green graviola fruit			0
it 's a great thirst quencher on a hot day , subtle , not overly sweet , a kind of natural squirt -- it 's also a good digestive aid			2
the @entity1 banana is the tastiest in the world , far superior to the bland @entity116 version ( say @entity1 ) , and it makes for super savory drinks			1
@entity1 is an outdoor world from the sidewalk cafes of @entity62 , to backyard barbecues , to beaches up and down the long coast , to the wild interior , @entity1 is a place to be outside			1
@entity1 revel in an outdoor culture , as befits a tropical land , and they have world - class natural environments to play in			1
beaches , jungles , waterfalls -- it 's here , often on an epic scale			2
one of the largest wetlands in the world , the @entity134 , spans 70,000 square miles in southwestern @entity1			1
it 's home to a thousand species of birds and 300 different mammals , from the @entity65 tapir to jaguar			2
for scale , it 's hard to match the immensity of the @entity147 rainforest , the largest in the world , or the power of @entity150 , which is the second widest and in volume in the world			1
@entity1 's @entity154 : the next tropical paradise there 's an enormous gap between rich and poor in world rankings for the gap between rich and poor , @entity1 has the 11th biggest gulf , coming in after a group of impoverished @entity163 countries			1
even though living standards have risen over the last decade and a number of @entity1 have entered the middle class , there 's still a huge chunk of the population living day to day			1
some 6 % of @entity1 live in the favelas ( slums ) , according to the 2010 census			1
these mountains of bricks , rising in intricate forms , border the country 's largest cities like @entity63 and @entity62			1
hospitals , schools , security and an end to police abuse have been the principle demands of recent protestors from this social sector			0
combine this with drug problems and crime syndicates infamous in the favelas , and you have a massive crime problem			0
tourists are n't usually the targets , but it 's smart to do what you would in any place where safety is a concern			0
stay in a safe area , do n't carry more money on you than you can afford to lose , keep your valuables in the hotel safe , use taxis vetted by your hotel , do n't take van taxis and make sure you know what part of town you 're in at night			0
one of its biggest cities is in the middle of the @entity147 the seventh largest city in @entity1 sits halfway up the @entity147 , where the @entity214 intersects the great river			1
an obscure outpost home to rubber barons in the 19th century , today it 's an industrial titan of 2 million residents that produces goods from mobile phones to motorcycles to @entity224 why make products as far away from the point of sale as you can get in @entity1 ? tax incentives			1
the @entity230 of @entity231 was created to spur economic growth in the isolated @entity147 region			1
it 's cheaper to make some products in the @entity147 than other parts of the country , where taxes are legendary			1
today , the city of @entity231 has gleaming office buildings and modern factories and is growing faster than many other parts of the country			0
the docks of the @entity214 still show vestiges of an older way of life -- double - decker ferryboats that carry people and products up and down the two behemoth rivers			0
parties are important @entity1 produce two of the biggest bashes the world has known in @entity257 's @entity256 celebration			1
but the festivities continue throughout the year , thanks to an abundance of regional celebrations , cities that promote the arts and a stockpile of religious holidays			0
in @entity62 , the city puts on free music fests , with top bands performing on stages across the city , while in @entity272 , at the city 's outdoor concert stage across the street from the beach , free concerts range from rock to forro to an event featuring every drummer with a drum kit in the city , more than 100 of them playing in unison			0
the @entity284 has a lot of festivals			0
the @entity288 festivals in @entity289 , in the northeast state of @entity291 in july mix the folkloric traditions of @entity163 , indigenous @entity293 and @entity294 together into a party unlike any other in @entity1			2
it 's carnival time in @entity62 rhythm is king the @entity1 knack for improvising on any musical theme makes this country unrivaled in the quantity and quality of different musical rhythms and styles			1
the outside world knows bossa nova , a slowed - down samba mixed with @entity65 jazz and @entity313 impressionism ; and samba , a blend of @entity163 drum circles and @entity294 marches			0
but @entity1 dances to the beat of many different drummers , reflecting its diverse population			2
the top @entity324 styles range from afoxe , ceremonial soundtrack for the religious processions of candomble , to lundu , maracatu , axe , ijexa , and frevo , the latter of which comes with a feverishly playful dance			0
keeping track of all the different beats has made @entity1 percussion the most sophisticated in the world , with a slew of drum instruments found nowhere else , such as the comical cuica , which sounds like a dog in heat			1
the @entity284 has its own country - style beats -- embolada , baio , xote and forro , which is also a hugely popular dance in @entity1			2
the rural folk music of the south gave rise to musica sertaneja , a romantic ballad style that is the most popular music in the country today			0
kissing strangers is customary getting to know people in @entity1 is a fast - track process			2
since they do n't place much stock in personal space , @entity1 have an easier time of breaking through the emotional space , too			2
it 's customary for a male introduced to an adult female to provide a kiss on both cheeks -- and on leaving , too			0
a day heavy in meet - and - greets can lead to a lot of cheek nuzzling , which for some makes @entity1 a wonderful thing and for others a place of more colds and flus			2
body language is as important as @entity58 here			0
guys are n't afraid to put an arm around another male to emphasize a point			0
placing a hand on a shoulder or providing a robust bear hug and a salvo of air kisses is part of an intricate social dance that results in a welcoming vibe for travelers			0
piranha wo n't eat you if you fall in an @entity147 river it 's burned indelibly into every movie fan 's mind -- the fiendish feeding frenzy of piranha stripping a human down to dental work			1
it turns out these pint - sized demons are n't nearly the sociopaths they 're cracked up to be			0
piranha live in the major river basins of @entity65 , and the @entity147 tributaries of @entity1 are well - stocked with them			1
they do have nasty choppers that bite @entity1 swimming in rivers , but they do n't strip them to the bone			2
some trace the origin of that legend to a visit by early 20th - century president @entity412			0
locals blocked off a river and filled it with starving piranha , and then tossed in a cow to guarantee a good show for the president			0
it set off the famous piranha swarm , embellished later by newsreel and movie makers			0
taming the piranha and busting myths in the @entity147			2
