when fields get plowed , diamonds do n't usually pop up			0
that 's unless you 're visiting @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7			2
that 's where @entity9 , an offshore steward from @entity10 , @entity11 , found a yellow 2.01 - carat diamond last week			1
it 's finders , keepers at the state park 's 37 - acre search field , which is named for an ancient eruption that littered the area with gems			1
the area , which became a state park in 1972 , is the only public site in the world where -- for a small fee -- you can dig for diamonds and keep them			1
the sparkling wedge - shaped stone is about the size of an @entity34 pea , park interpreter @entity30 said in a news release			2
it 's the largest stone of the 20 found this year , he said			0
" more than half an inch of rain had fallen two days before his visit , washing loose soil from the surface of the diamond search area , and , no doubt , uncovering the large , yellow gem , " @entity30 said			2
" anyone could have found it , but mr. @entity9 was in the right place at the right time			0
" @entity9 , who plans to sell the diamond , named it the @entity51 after his mother 's initials			0
it 's not clear how much @entity9 will get for the diamond , and park officials are n't trained to appraise them , according to the park website			2
but @entity60 @entity59 found a 3.85 - carat diamond in 2013 and sold it last year for $ 20,000			1
a @entity0 50 states pick : crater of diamonds before @entity9 's find , park staff had plowed the area to bring more diamonds to the surface for visitors to find			0
the 40.23 - carat @entity71 , the nation 's largest diamond , was found in 1924			1
the " perfect " 3.03 - carat @entity76 - @entity75 diamond was found in 1990 , and a man discovered the white 6.19 - carat @entity78 in april			1
the park stretches for more than 900 acres along the @entity80 , but the hunt in the diamond field is the big draw			0
more than 75,000 diamonds have been discovered there since farmer @entity86 discovered gems on what was then his property in 1906 .			0
