forgive the wistful opening but it 's true			0
the saccharine pop hit " @entity15 " may have played endlessly on the radio and the " @entity9 " screensaver displayed on virtually every cubicle @entity10 , but i forgive the kitsch of that era			0
it was a time before @entity17 became a top destination for resume - wielding @entity19			2
and it was a time of intellectual exchange between curious locals and sinophile expats , each drawn by a strong mutual interest in culture , music , and emerging technology			0
in circa 1997 @entity2 , there was no relentless gridlock or constant smartphone use to prevent free and open exploration in the real world			0
and there were only 620,000 internet users across the entire country			0
this was the dawn of dot - coms in @entity17			2
cigarettes and instant noodles when i could n't land my dream job as a full - time reporter in @entity2 , i took up a post with a fledgling @entity47 internet firm i had covered as a freelancer			1
that start - up would later grow into @entity50 , one of @entity17 's leading @entity53 companies			1
its original one - room office in the @entity56 was spartan to say the least			2
forget the gourmet canteens of @entity58 today			1
seventeen years ago , the dotcom diet in @entity2 was @entity61 - laced instant noodles and cigarettes at your desk			1
i was the only @entity64 woman in the company and one of a few thousand @entity64 expats in the city			0
if you were an expat in @entity17 , you were probably there because of a genuine interest in the country and its culture			2
we were n't there to exploit the economic opportunity of a so - called rising @entity17			2
we were just there for an adventure			0
dotcom game in 1999 , i met fellow @entity80 expat @entity79 for dinner while he was leading the internet marketing group at @entity83 in @entity2			0
he was curious about jumping into the @entity17 dotcom game and wanted to know more about what it was like			0
i recently caught up with @entity79 to reminisce about that time and learn more about why he decided to take that risk and join a @entity53 start - up			1
" i had a number of clients who had different internet start - ups and they all looked like they were having such a great time , so i wanted to join in and be part of it , " he tells me			1
" i met with different managers of different companies , and the one i finally felt comfortable with was @entity99 just because they had a very international mindset			2
" @entity79 joined @entity99 in april 2000 and for the next eight years worked as a vice president in charge of the company 's international website operations , marketing and corporate affairs			1
he witnessed @entity99 's rise from a tiny start - up running out of a small apartment to a global internet giant			1
and even though he left his post there a few years back , @entity79 is thrilled for the company as it goes to market with its blockbuster ipo			0
" for me , there 's some satisfaction in seeing that the company i played a role in building in the early days has grown to become possibly the world 's largest e-commerce company , " he says			1
@entity79 left @entity99 to become a consultant and filmmaker			0
in his documentary film , " @entity128 in the @entity129 , " he tells the story of @entity99 's struggle in its early years and eventual triumph over @entity127 in @entity17			1
far from over i too left my @entity47 dotcom to become a storyteller of sorts			0
over the years , i 've shared my experiences in @entity17 's nascent it industry and ventured into journalism			1
seventeen years ago in @entity2 , there were riveting debates in tea houses and over hot pot dinners			0
it 's since been forced into the open in a very big way thanks to the rise of social media and mobile messaging now reaching more than 600 million @entity47			1
as a journalist , the tension and the opportunity of @entity17 's now mammoth dotcoms has been a thrill to both witness and report			1
and the story is far from over .			0

@entity1 's @entity156 worked for @entity50 , a @entity47 tech start - up , in the 1990s
@entity50 and peers like @entity99 are now some of the world 's biggest @entity53 companies
back then , offices were spartan and *lunch* was instant noodles , not gourmet canteens
the rise of @entity17 's mammoth dotcoms has been a thrill to both witness and report
