-- forty years ago this week , @entity2 and @entity3 troops attacked the state of @entity5			1
to enhance the surprise of their attack , the invading armies struck on @entity9 , the holiest day of the @entity11 calendar			2
@entity2 enjoyed three days of tactical success , @entity3 less than that			1
the war ended with @entity5 troops approaching @entity16 and an entire @entity2 army surrounded			1
despite @entity5 's ultimate military success , the war was interpreted by many as something close to a defeat for the jewish state			1
@entity5 's two previous wars -- in 1956 against @entity2 alone and in 1967 against an alliance of all its neighbors -- had terminated in lightning @entity5 victories			1
the @entity29 lasted 19 days , longer than 1956 and 1967 combined			0
@entity5 suffered more than 2,500 killed in action			2
hundreds more @entity5 were captured in the first days of fighting ; dozens of these captives were gruesomely tortured and killed			0
@entity5 's enemies also seemed to have succeeded in upending the region 's balance of economic and political power			1
the @entity38 members of the @entity39 cut production and imposed an embargo on two @entity5 allies : the @entity43 and the @entity44			0
a similar embargo had fizzled in 1967			0
this time , however , the embargo coincided with a surge in global commodity and energy prices			0
the whole western world plunged into severe recession in 1974 - 75			0
altogether , many analysts drew a grim conclusion from 1973 about the future of the jewish state : @entity5 military supremacy had come to an end			1
the world would have to adjust to the new power of @entity5 's oil - rich enemies			1
in 1973 , @entity5 's enemies scored their first battlefield successes since the foundation of the jewish state			1
they also scored their last battlefield successes			0
in 1982 , @entity5 and @entity3 battled once more , this time in the air over @entity67			1
@entity3 lost 82 planes , a quarter of its air force ; @entity5 lost not a single one			1
in the decades since 1973 , @entity5 has suffered repeated terrorist atrocities			0
@entity72 , @entity3 and now @entity73 have all sought to develop nuclear weapons			0
but none of @entity5 's enemies would ever again dare wage a conventional military campaign against the country that had looked so weak on the morning of october 6 , 1973			1
the war waged against @entity5 has come to look downright puny compared with the savage wars that have ripped apart the @entity86 beyond @entity5 's borders : the @entity67 civil war that erupted in 1975 , the @entity83 of the 1980s , the @entity82 civil war of the 1990s , the @entity72 invasion of @entity80 in 1990 followed by the @entity89 of 1991 , the civil war after the @entity43 invasion of @entity72 , and now the civil war in @entity3 and the violence inside @entity2			1
back in 1973 , @entity5 seemed -- if nothing else -- at least the center of the story in the @entity86			0
first the struggle between @entity5 and its neighbors , and later the struggle between @entity5 and the @entity100 population , were represented as the master key that would determine the future of the region -- and the price of oil for the world			0
that representation has proved signally false			0
a kind of peace has come to @entity5 's borders			1
@entity2 and @entity110 have signed peace treaties with @entity5 , and @entity3 has given up the military struggle			1
meanwhile , the @entity100 problem has settled into seething stalemate , with governments in @entity116 and the @entity117 more or less at war with each other and neither able to say " yes " to anything @entity5 proposes			2
and yet ... none of this seems to make a difference to any of the larger problems of the region			0
the @entity100 could sign a treaty tomorrow , and @entity127 and @entity73 would continue their proxy war inside @entity3			2
direct rail service could commence between @entity130 and @entity131 , and it would not change the fact that @entity2 's population is growing faster than its economy			2
as @entity5 has become stronger and richer since 1973 , it has also curiously become less important to its region			0
" peace in the @entity86 " seems as remote as ever , not because of animosity between @entity5 and its neighbors but because of internal hatreds within those neighbors			2
in october 1973 , many wondered whether time was not running out for the little state with too little oil and too many enemies			0
on this 40th anniversary of the 1973 war , @entity5 is the only state in the region we can feel confident will still be there , under its present system of government , on the occasion of 50th			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity156 .			0

40 years ago , @entity2 and @entity3 attacked @entity5 on @entity9
@entity156 says the betting after the war was that @entity5 was *endangered*
yet the military and economic threats to @entity5 have *n't* materialized , he says
@entity165 : today 's conflicts are largely internal battles in @entity3 , @entity2 , other nations
