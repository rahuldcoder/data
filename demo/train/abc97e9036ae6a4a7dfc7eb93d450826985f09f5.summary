it 's not just the @entity1 grappling with the issue of same - sex marriage			1
many countries around the world are re-examining their laws , and some appear to be on the brink of changing them			2
senators in @entity11 approved a marriage equality bill tuesday that puts them on course to be the 12th country in the world to legalize same - sex marriage			1
and this week , senators in @entity18 will begin weighing a bill that would legalize same - sex marriage and allow same - sex couples to adopt children			1
the bill , which has the support of president @entity23 , has cleared the lower house of @entity25			0
it " would be a major advance for our country in terms of equality of rights , " said the @entity18 gay , lesbian and transgender rights group @entity26			1
" the law must allow all couples to unite themselves as they wish and must protect all families , without discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity			0
" but like the @entity1 , @entity18 is far from united on the issue			0
in january , hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of @entity45 to protest same - sex marriage			1
most of @entity18 is catholic , and the @entity48 strongly opposes the bill , along with social conservatives and other religious groups			0
" i do not personally agree with gay marriage , as i am a @entity57 and believe what the @entity58 says about marriage being between one woman and one man for a lifetime , " said @entity52 , who shot video of the @entity45 march on his phone			2
" if your lifestyle does n't allow you to conceive , there is a reason			0
" across the @entity69 , the @entity68 is also considering legalization			0
in february , lawmakers in the @entity72 approved the second reading of a bill that would legalize same - sex marriage in @entity76 and @entity77			1
( @entity78 has its own legalization bill in the works , while @entity81 rejected a similar measure in october			0
) more debate and more votes are still necessary before the bill can become law , but the wide margin of february 's vote -- 400 - 175 -- suggests that it may have the support it needs to eventually pass			2
prime minister @entity90 is also in favor of the bill , despite opposition within his own party			0
" i am a great supporter of marriage , " @entity90 said in the @entity72			2
" i want to promote marriage , defend marriage , encourage marriage			2
" the great thing about ( february 's ) vote is that two gay people who love each other will now be able to get married , and i think that is an important advance			0
i think we should be promoting marriage rather than looking at any other way of weakening it			2
" a former @entity68 colony , @entity109 , could legalize same - sex marriage this month			1
after a marriage equality bill passed two readings in @entity25 -- the latest in march by a 77 - 44 margin -- the third and final vote is widely expected to be a formality			2
the public , however , might be more split than its lawmakers			0
according to a survey conducted last month by the country 's largest newspaper , the @entity122 , opposition to same - sex marriage has increased to 48 %			1
that sentiment is more in line with nearby @entity126 , where lawmakers overwhelmingly voted against a legalization bill in september			0
in @entity11 , the bill approved tuesday by a 23 - 8 margin now goes back to lawmakers in the lower house of parliament			1
that house approved a different version of the bill in december			0
in 2009 , @entity11 became the first @entity137 country to allow same - sex couples to adopt children			1
it was also one of the first @entity137 countries to allow civil unions			2
same - sex marriage is backed by president @entity144 and , according to one poll , the majority of the public			1
but @entity148 is the only country in @entity137 that has legalized same - sex marriage , doing so in 2010			1
@entity149 and @entity150 , like the @entity1 , have same - sex marriages only in certain states			1
of the 11 countries where same - sex marriage is legal , eight are in @entity155			1
the @entity156 was the first , in 2001 , and it was later joined by @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163			1
@entity148 , @entity164 and @entity165 are the three @entity167 countries in the group			2
there are no @entity171 countries where same - sex marriage is legal , but perhaps that might soon change			1
last year , a same - sex @entity175 couple married in @entity177 , where a legalization bill has been pending since 2003			1
@entity179 is also home to @entity171 's largest annual gay pride parade , according to organizers			0
the @entity182 ruled in favor of legalization in 2008 , but those rights have n't been put into effect because the country 's new constitution has been stuck in limbo for years			0
in july , the @entity190 in @entity191 said it would consider a provision for same - sex marriage rights in an amendment to the country 's marriage laws			1
" it 's time for us to look at the reality , " minister @entity197 said in an online debate at the time			0
" the number of homosexuals has mounted to hundreds of thousands			0
it 's not a small figure			0
... they may own property			0
we , of course , have to handle these issues legally			0

the @entity156 was first country to legalize same - sex marriage in 2001
several countries have pending *legislation* and may join that group soon
@entity11 and @entity191 are among the leading *candidates*
