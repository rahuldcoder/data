@entity0 , @entity1 divers are preparing to investigate underwater pings that may be coming from the flight recorders of @entity6 , @entity1 's military chief said friday			1
an @entity1 search vessel had earlier detected the pings , said gen. @entity10 , the head of @entity1 's armed forces			1
he was speaking on board the ship that is being used as a base for divers trying to raise the tail of the @entity6 plane , which went down in the @entity18 on december 28 with 162 people on board			1
but there is also caution surrounding the possible pings , because the sound could be emanating from other sources			1
in the case of @entity28 , several signals raised hopes of locating the missing plane , but proved to be false leads			0
search teams , which had been battling bad weather and strong currents , found the tail section on the sea floor wednesday			1
that discovery was seen as significant because in the @entity41 , the aircraft model of @entity6 , the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder are housed in the tail			2
but before friday , searchers had n't reported detecting any possible pings from the locator beacons on the flight recorders , which are popularly known as black boxes			2
it was unclear whether the devices remained inside the tail or had come free			2
batteries that send out the pings last 30 days			2
it has been 13 days since the @entity6 plane fell into the sea			0
conditions cleared up friday , as divers prepared for a complicated operation to raise the tail to find the recorders			0
divers are lowering ropes and slings down to the tail			0
the plan is to inflate giant airbags or balloons underneath to lift the tail from the bottom of the sea			0
a crane would then be used to raise the section			0
search officials said that the underwater visibility and currents are much better than conditions in previous days			0
experts say the information contained within the flight recorders is likely to enable investigators to figure out why @entity6 dropped off radar and went down in the sea on its way from the @entity1 city of @entity0 to @entity85			1
the plane 's pilot had asked to change course and climb to a higher altitude minutes before contact was lost , according to @entity1 officials			1
the vast majority of the people on the plane were @entity1			1
there were also citizens of @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity85 and @entity101			0
a total of 48 bodies have so far been recovered from the sea , @entity1 's search and rescue agency said friday			1
some of the bodies have been found still strapped into seats			0
@entity2 's @entity108 , @entity109 and journalist @entity110 contributed to this report .			0
