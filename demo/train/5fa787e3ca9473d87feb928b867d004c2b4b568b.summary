-- when @entity2 lands in @entity3 on her way to @entity5 , @entity3 , she learns her airline ticket is n't valid			2
her airline forces her to buy a new one			2
@entity2 asks her online agency , @entity10 , for a refund , but more than six months later , she 's still out $ 879			1
is she also out of options ? q : i need your help getting my money back for a plane ticket i had to pay for twice			1
here 's my story : i bought tickets online through @entity10 from @entity21 to @entity5 , @entity3			1
when we arrived in @entity3 , @entity23 representatives told us that @entity10 had n't paid for the last leg of our trip			1
so i had to buy new tickets			2
two members of our group also had to pay again			0
after i returned home , i faxed all of my documents to a supervisor at @entity10			1
that was six months ago			0
i 've called her repeatedly and left messages , but no one has contacted me , and i 'm out $ 879			2
is there anything you can do ? -- @entity2 , @entity41 , @entity42 a : you should n't have to pay twice for your airline tickets			0
but you also should n't be too quick to blame @entity10 for the mix - up			1
a lot can go wrong when you 're dealing with a flight schedule that involves multiple carriers			2
reservations can be lost , paper tickets and boarding passes can be misread			0
and , of course , there 's the language issue			0
when you 're traveling internationally , something can easily get lost in the translation			0
@entity10 may -- or may not -- have been responsible for your non-working tickets			1
but as your online travel agent , it was responsible for helping you fix it			0
that 's why you buy from an intermediary and pay a booking fee : so there 's someone to turn to when something goes wrong			2
the online agency should n't have kept you in a holding pattern for more than six months			1
@entity10 's " @entity69 " promises " to provide all our customers with 24/7 toll - free number support because we understand the importance of critical last - minute client / traveler needs and requirements for changes to trips			1
" i guess offering a toll - free number around the clock does n't necessarily mean your questions will be answered quickly , but you ca n't blame me if i 'm left with that impression			0
you could have avoided a lengthy dance with @entity10 by taking this up with @entity23 either when you were flying to @entity5 or returning home			2
if you had arrived at the airport a half - hour earlier , you might have been able to speak with a supervisor and straightened this out			0
once you were home , and were running into a brick wall with @entity10 's supervisor , i would have tried knocking on the front door again			1
normally , starting a new query through an online form means your complaint will get reviewed again and may be assigned a new case number			0
a phone call does n't work the same way			0
after you hang up , your case is basically closed			0
i contacted @entity10 on your behalf			1
it apologized for the delay and said it contacted @entity103 , but could n't determine why your ticket was n't accepted			1
an airline representative told @entity10 it would have to speak to the agent who was working at the ticket counter when you checked in , which was impossible			1
@entity10 refunded the $ 879 you spent on your second ticket			1
@entity111 is the ombudsman for @entity114 magazine			0
