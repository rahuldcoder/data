@entity0 -- president @entity3 's ambitious strategy for @entity4 and neighboring @entity5 , dubbed " @entity7 " by administration officials , will face its first test wednesday when he meets with the leaders of both countries -- neither of which is seen as able to maintain stability and fight strengthening @entity15 insurgencies			1
@entity5 president @entity16 will meet with @entity4 's president and president @entity3			1
the president will meet separately with @entity4 president @entity19 and @entity5 president @entity16 before holding a joint session with the two leaders			1
the leaders also will hold talks at the @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and on @entity27			0
@entity3 will try to build an enduring regional alliance with both countries , enlisting them as full partners rather than treating them as battlefields for @entity33 soldiers to fight extremists			0
but both leaders are seen as weak and are deeply unpopular back home			0
the @entity37 has re-emerged to retake large swaths of @entity4 , and in recent weeks , @entity37 fighters have made alarming advances in @entity5			1
just last week , the @entity24 warned that @entity41 continues to enjoy safe haven along the rugged border between the countries , where @entity41 plots attacks against the @entity33 and its allies			0
@entity33 concern has focused on @entity5 , which rep. @entity48 , @entity50 - @entity49 , on monday aptly warned has its " pants on fire			2
" in @entity5 's @entity59 , the government 's recent peace deal with militants pushing for the establishment of strict @entity15 law went awry , allowing the @entity37 to advance within 60 miles of the capital , @entity61			1
the government 's initial inaction prompted secretary of state @entity64 to accuse @entity61 of abdicating to terrorists			0
@entity3 also expressed concern about the fragility of @entity16 's government			2
@entity69 , @entity3 's formidable point man for @entity7 , insists @entity5 is n't a failed state			1
yet there is plenty of concern in @entity0 that @entity16 's government could fall , leaving @entity5 's considerable nuclear arsenal at risk			2
@entity69 also played down reports the @entity33 is courting @entity16 's main political rival , former prime minister @entity77			0
rather , officials say the @entity33 wants the two men to work together , which would divert @entity16 's attention away from domestic political squabbles and enable him to unite the country in the fight against extremists			0
this is the @entity33 main challenge -- persuading @entity5 to focus on what it considers a " mortal threat , " and not on what @entity3 himself has called the @entity5 military 's misguided " obsession " with neighboring @entity91			1
the @entity37 advances seem to have delivered a wake - up call to the government , which has launched an offensive against the militants			2
to help , @entity3 has asked @entity99 to quickly approve hundreds of millions of dollars in emergency aid to help the @entity5 combat the insurgency and is supporting a $ 7.5 billion civilian aid package over the next five years			2
concerned about reports that the @entity5 military is working at cross-purposes and , in some cases , aiding the @entity37 , @entity99 is trying to condition the money on progress made by @entity5 forces in rooting out extremists			2
a key component of the @entity33 strategy is a surge in civilian assistance to boost domestic support for both governments			0
in an effort to promote more economic development and cooperation between the @entity33 and the two countries , the ministers of agriculture and finance from both countries have been invited to @entity0 to join the talks			0
while the @entity33 focus clearly has been on @entity5 , violence in @entity4 has reached its highest levels since @entity37 forces were driven from power after the @entity33 invaded in the fall of 2001 in response to the 9/11 terror attacks			1
the @entity33 wants to ensure stability in the lead - up to august elections , which is why @entity3 has committed 21,000 additional troops , in addition to the much needed economic assistance			2
since talking office in january , @entity3 and other @entity33 officials have been tough on @entity19 , criticizing his government as ineffective and weak on corruption			0
@entity19 further angered @entity33 officials this week when he named @entity144 , a powerful warlord accused of violating human rights , as his vice presidential running mate , despite warnings from secretary of state @entity148 that @entity144 would be a polarizing choice			0
but despite the belief by many in @entity0 it is time for @entity19 to go , the @entity4 president arrived this week in @entity0 virtually assured re-election , having persuaded his main opposition not to run against him			0
in a speech tuesday , @entity19 wisely said " money ca n't buy you love " and " force wo n't buy you obedience " those sentiments illustrate one of the deficits in @entity3 's strategy			1
while the @entity33 hopes the additional assistance will turn both leaders into reliable allies , the administration has yet to unveil a plan for communicating directly to the @entity4 and @entity5 populations , both of which are skeptical of the @entity33 intentions toward their countries			1
additionally , the @entity33 has focused its diplomacy so far on officials at the federal level , and efforts to establish strong and regular lines of communication with provincial government officials are in their infancy			0
that has contributed to the lack of @entity33 influence in @entity5 during the @entity37 's recent advances in the @entity187			1
creating and implementing an effective strategy toward @entity4 , and more importantly , @entity5 , is proving to be one of the most challenging , yet important , foreign policy issues facing the @entity3 administration			1
wednesday 's talks will be the first indicator as to whether the @entity33 has two partners in what has been dubbed " @entity3 's war			1
" @entity1 's @entity197 contributed to this report .			0
