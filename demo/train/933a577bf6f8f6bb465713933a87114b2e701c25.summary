simply sitting on his couch is painful			0
the walker next to @entity3 is the constant reminder that he is a long way from being healed			1
" how do i feel about what happened ? " he said			0
" how would anybody feel getting shot ? " still visibly angry , @entity3 , 60 , sat down with @entity10 for his first television interview since sheriff 's deputies mistook him for a car thief and shot at him 15 times in his driveway , outside his own car			1
he may be the luckiest man you 've read about in a long time			0
why ? because , somehow , 13 of those bullets managed to miss him			0
the @entity23 man 's leg was shattered and is now being held together by metal rods			2
" i ask myself why they shot me first			2
and why they shoot me so many times afterwards			0
yeah , i ask why -- that 's all i can ask is why , " he told @entity10			1
@entity13 's deputies were responding to a neighbor 's 911 call when they arrived in @entity3 's @entity34 neighborhood early in the morning on july 27			1
@entity3 said he had had a couple of beers earlier and had just come home from a friend 's house			1
he said he was sober			0
he was in his car in his driveway but was mistaken for a car thief by his neighbor			0
@entity45 sheriff 's deputy @entity44 and sgt. @entity46 walked up his driveway			1
according to sheriff @entity47 , @entity3 did not respond to their commands and kept going into and out of the car			1
with his car keys , which had a small gold flashlight on them , in his hand , @entity3 allegedly lunged at the deputies			1
" the point to making the comments about the lunging was his herky - jerky movements that he was making			0
and again , a failure to follow the deputies ' instructions , " @entity47 said			1
that 's when @entity44 and @entity46 opened fire			2
they have been placed on paid administrative leave while the @entity67 investigates the case			2
they will send their findings to the @entity45 state 's attorney 's office , which will determine whether any charges will be filed against them			2
" there was nothing glaringly apparent to us that the officers did that was out of the ordinary in the given set of circumstances as have been given to us , " @entity47 said in an interview with @entity10			1
but @entity3 says the deputies were not doing their job			1
" they should have asked me , did i live here ? ran my address or license plate or something , " he said			0
when asked to respond to @entity3 's comment , @entity47 said , " how long has mr. @entity3 been a law enforcement officer ? it 's a car burglary in progress			1
you do n't roll up behind the car , expose yourself or your partner and wait for the tag to come back			0
the officers get out of the car ... respond to the suspect			1
at this time mr. @entity3 was a suspect at that time			2
" @entity3 is beginning the legal process to pursue a civil suit against the sheriff 's office for excessive force			1
he 's represented by @entity104			0
" @entity3 has been permanently injured			2
no question about it , " @entity104 said			0
" if we can not resolve it through peaceful negotiation , then we have no other choice but to let the court of law evaluate their conduct			0
" but even @entity3 is unsure what restitution would be sufficient or if an apology would suffice			2
" i do n't know what you call enough , " he said			0
" if it would make me walk again , yeah			0
