-- a reporter from a right - wing media outlet heckled president @entity3 -- not once , but twice -- on friday as he was unveiling a new immigration policy			1
if this shocks you , you have n't been paying attention			0
this is simply the latest page from the right 's playbook to delegitimize @entity3 's presidency			1
some may dismiss it as an isolated incident , but it 's not			2
believe me , i know hecklers -- i 'm a stand - up comedian			2
if someone heckles me once , it can be a mistake : too many drinks , overcome by emotion , etc. but when you heckle twice , you have an agenda			0
@entity25 , the @entity26 born reporter who heckled president @entity3 , was not just from some random publication			1
he works for @entity28 , a right - wing website whose editor - in - chief is the bow - tie wearing @entity33			1
( you may recall @entity33 as the guy who famously sparred with â € ” and was taken down by -- @entity35 on @entity0 years ago			0
) @entity25 's first heckle occurred while president @entity3 was in midsentence , with @entity25 yelling out : " why do you favor foreigners over @entity40 ? " @entity3 responded : " excuse me , sir , but it 's not time for questions			1
" @entity25 countered : " are you going to take questions ? " to which the president answered : " not while i 'm speaking			0
" later , @entity25 again interrupted the president in midstatement			0
@entity3 kept his cool ; he simply finished his statement			2
if i had been president , i would have deported @entity25 back to his country of origin			0
a quick perusal of @entity25 's @entity55 feed reveals he does not hide his contempt for president @entity3			1
his tweets range from claims that @entity3 is using @entity59 and country music to attract " white non-college voters , " to slams of @entity63 , to allegations that @entity3 is racially discriminating against blacks in his @entity67 hiring practices			1
but this is all not about @entity25 -- he is just a small cog in the right 's campaign to diminish the legitimacy of @entity3 's presidency			1
i 'm not talking about people disagreeing with policies			0
i mean specifically the campaign to paint @entity3 as less than @entity40 -- as an " other " -- as someone whose presidency is not entitled to the same respect as that of the presidents who came before him			1
this crusade began in the days before @entity3 was even sworn in as president			1
back then , @entity85 , the radio host and self - described " entertainer , " announced on his show that he hoped @entity3 would fail as president			1
@entity3 had not even made his first decision as president			2
the campaign has continued with the right 's birther movement contending that @entity3 was not born in the @entity40 and hence should not be president			1
some , like evangelical leader @entity96 , have suggested that @entity3 is a @entity97 ( he is a @entity98 ) , which to many on the right would mean he 's not a " real " @entity40			2
we have seen @entity104 rep. @entity103 yell out at president @entity3 , " you lie " while @entity3 addressed a joint session of @entity107 in 2009			1
can anyone remember the last time a @entity40 president was called a liar in a joint session of @entity107 ? i ca n't			0
then there was @entity104 rep. @entity104 , who last july called on president @entity3 to " quit lying " in regards to the debt ceiling debate			2
can anyone remember something like this with previous presidents ? i ca n't either			0
and , of course , there 's @entity122 , not only periodically renewing the " birther " fabrication , but also demanding to see president @entity3 's college grades , implying he does n't think @entity3 is intellectually qualified to be president			1
so you see , @entity25 is just doing his tiny part			0
and no doubt some on the right will exalt him for his " courage			0
" his boss , @entity33 , defended him by saying that no one was upset when then - @entity134 reporter @entity133 heckled president @entity135			1
but @entity137 ' @entity136 recalled today that when he was a @entity67 correspondent with @entity133 during the @entity135 administration , no one ever heckled the president			2
so , yet another lie			0
but the truth does n't matter to the far right			0
it 's not about policy or what is good for the @entity40			0
it 's about delegitimizing president @entity3 for political gain			1
in the coming months , as we get closer to @entity150 , you may see many more of these kinds of attacks			0
while they may disgust you , they should never surprise you			0
it 's all in the playbook			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity159 .			2

@entity159 : a reporter from right - wing site heckled @entity3 as he talked about immigration
he says heckling from @entity26 - born reporter part of right 's campaign to delegitimize @entity63
he says incidents *include* @entity103 's " you lie , " @entity122 seeking @entity3 's grades
@entity159 : expect to see more *disrespecting* of the president as " the other " during campaign
