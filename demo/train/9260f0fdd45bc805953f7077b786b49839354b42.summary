-- a federal judge struck down key parts of a new @entity4 abortion law , considered among the most restrictive in the country , on monday , one day before they were scheduled to take effect			2
the lawsuit -- filed in @entity8 in @entity9 by @entity10 on behalf of more than a dozen women 's health care providers across @entity4 -- alleged the law violates the constitutional rights of women and puts unreasonable demands on doctors who perform abortions			2
the lawsuit specifically targets requirements under the new law that doctors obtain admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic at which they 're providing abortion services , and usage controls on @entity26 , a drug that induces abortions			1
@entity30 district judge @entity29 blocked the law 's admitting privileges requirement , arguing that it " places a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus and is thus an undue burden to her			1
" he also blocked a part of the law that deals with medication - induced abortions but allowed restrictions on the same issue to move forward			1
provisions such as requiring strict use under @entity48 protocol and mandatory follow - up visits remain in place			0
" the medication - abortion provisions may not be enforced against any physician who determines , in appropriate medical judgment , to perform a medication - abortion using the off - label protocol for the preservation of the life or health of the mother , " @entity29 wrote			1
abortion - rights groups say the judge did not go far enough on the issue of medication - induced abortion , believing doctors should be able to use it with few restrictions			1
" today 's ruling marks an important victory for @entity4 women and sends a clear message to lawmakers : it is unconstitutional for politicians to pass laws that take personal , private decisions away from women and their doctors , " @entity67 , president of @entity10 , said in a statement			2
" while this ruling protects access to safe and legal abortion for women in many parts of the state , part of this ruling will make it impossible for many women to access medication abortion , which is safe and effective early in pregnancy , " she said			0
conservative groups were disappointed by the ruling			0
" blocking this law only puts vulnerable women in greater danger			0
we are very disturbed that a judge would partially block a law that is grounded in the latest science and in common sense , " said @entity97 , director of the @entity98 at the @entity99			2
the bill originally failed to gain approval because of a @entity108 filibuster led by state sen. @entity109			0
@entity4 gov. @entity110 then called the legislature into a second special session to continue consideration of the bill			1
in response to the judge 's ruling , @entity110 vowed he and others will keep fighting			2
if the state decides to appeal , the case would head next to the 5th @entity122 in @entity123			1
" today 's decision will not stop our ongoing efforts to protect life and ensure the women of our state are n't exposed to any more of the abortion - mill horror stories that have made headlines recently , " the governor said			1
he added : " we will continue fighting to implement the laws passed by the duly - elected officials of our state , laws that reflect the will and values of @entity137			0
" separately , the law prohibits abortions past 20 weeks of gestation			0
that ban takes effect , as scheduled , on tuesday			0
@entity0 's @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 contributed to this report .			0
