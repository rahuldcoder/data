@entity0 -- among the fearless young men carving scars into the faces of towering waves , is the " @entity6			2
" at 41 , @entity7 is old enough to be the father of some of his competitors on the @entity11			1
but the 11 - time world champion -- dubbed " @entity13 " -- is far from washed up			1
at a time when his friends are settled down with families , the original surfing pin - up boy is still scoring perfect 10s on the international circuit			1
" friends that were on tour with me 20 years ago , 10 years ago , are now family guys married with kids , " he said			2
" they say ' i ca n't believe you 're still doing it , that you 're looking for waves every day			2
' " but i want to surf better tomorrow			0
i want to surf better in 10 years			0
when i 'm 50 i want to be a better surfer than i am now -- for me it 's a lifelong journey			2
" rise to the top for @entity7 , it 's a journey that began as a child growing up in the surfing town of @entity34 , in @entity35			1
aged 20 he became the youngest person to win the @entity37 , smashing the record books again when he also became the oldest person to win the title at 39			0
watch video : looking for the perfect wave indeed , @entity7 is one of the few professional surfers to have transcended the niche sports magazines to the society pages , appearing in dozens of films and starring in hit 1990s tv show baywatch			1
" i wanted to be [ the actor ] @entity50 when i was a kid			0
i wanted to be a comedian , " said @entity7			1
" when i was eight or 10 years old i did n't know that i could have a career from surfing			2
there were pro surfers who were my heroes , but those guys were n't rich			1
they were just surfing and traveling and that 's really been the goal my whole life			2
" spiritual surfing surfing is more than a career for @entity7 -- it 's a spiritual experience , providing solace and filling him with a sense of wonder at nature			1
" surfing is my religion , if i have one , " he said			1
" the barrel [ the hollow of a breaking wave ] is really the ultimate ride for any surfer			2
it 's the eye of the storm			0
some guys say it 's like being in the womb			0
" for me it 's sort of like time slows down			2
you become hyper aware of a lot of different things -- the way the wave is breaking , timing , putting yourself in the right part of the barrel			0
it takes all of your mental capacity to do it just right			0
" despite being one of the oldest competitors on the international circuit , @entity7 has lost none of the grace , skill and fearlessness that made him the most successful surfer in the history of the sport			1
he scored a perfect 10 for a jaw - dropping reverse flip at notoriously treacherous @entity102 in southern @entity103 last year			2
" this section came at me , and i just launched myself , kind of a ' @entity105 , ' " said @entity7			1
" i did n't know if i was going to land it , or if i was going to break my board , or if i was going to break an ankle			0
" daredevils but along with the thrills come huge dangers , with @entity7 admitting that many of his friends have drowned while surfing			1
" it makes you think about what it 's worth			0
but what 's life worth ? life 's worth experiences and it 's worth the people in your life too , " he said			0
" i 'm sure it 's different once you have a partner in your life or kids -- maybe that one wave 's not that important any more			0
" and as technology develops , the mega waves which decades ago surfers could only dream of riding , are now within reach			1
today , thrill seekers are towed by jet ski into colossal waves that would once have been out of bounds			1
but the dangers are just as large , with surfers risking being pushed up to 15 - meters below the water			1
" big waves are a whole different ball game , " said @entity7			1
" you 're riding a wave with an immense amount of speed and power , generally over 10 meters			0
on the face of the wave , obviously life and death thoughts start to happen			0
" same ball game @entity7 has been chasing waves his whole life			1
and you get the feeling his obsession with the water has little to do with the $ 3.5 million in prize money he 's earned			0
" the other day we were watching this dog chasing a ball , and i was like ' @entity169 would n't it be so great if you could do the same thing over and over and over again your whole life and it 's still as fun ? ' " he said			0
" and i 'm like : wait ! that 's what we do			0
we travel around the whole world just to do that			0
so waves for surfers are like balls for dogs			2
we 're just constantly chasing them			0
" he may have been playing the same ball game over more than four decades , but when it comes to surfing , @entity7 's love is as deep as the ocean .			1

" @entity13 " @entity7 is the most successful pro surfer in history
at 41 , @entity7 competes against surfers half his age , shows no sign of slowing down
surfing is a " religion " for 11 - time world champion , who finds *beauty* and solace in waves
thrill comes with danger , with friends losing lives to giant waves
