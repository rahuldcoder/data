@entity1 , @entity0 -- an ill - tempered @entity4 match between @entity5 and @entity6 recently saw three players and @entity5 coach @entity8 sent off amid violent scenes in @entity10 , @entity11			1
@entity15 teammates @entity12 ( left ) and @entity13 turn against one - another			1
the 1 - 1 draw , which saw the referee add on 10 minutes at the end for all the various stoppages , got @entity20 thinking about some of the most controversial match melees that have occurred			1
do you agree with our worst 11 ? post your comments in the @entity27 box below			1
1 @entity28 , @entity31 v @entity29 , @entity32 1962 surely the most violent match in history			2
the tone was set when the first foul was committed after 12 seconds			2
two @entity38 players were sent off as the teams spent the whole 90 minutes punching , spitting and scuffling with each other , with @entity31 managing to score two goals in - between the fighting			1
police had to come onto the pitch three times to sort out the chaos while @entity38 @entity47 had to be escorted off by armed officers when he refused to leave the pitch after his dismissal			1
referee @entity51 remarked : " i was n't reffing a football match , i was acting as an umpire in military maneuvers			0
" 2 @entity56 v @entity55 , @entity57 2007 six yellow cards were handed out during the game , but it was events that followed which marred @entity56 's passage through to the quarterfinals			0
on the final whistle , @entity55 midfielder @entity65 came together with @entity56 defender @entity67 , sparking a brawl			0
unused @entity56 substitute @entity69 then ran onto the field , to join in - the result of which was a broken nose for @entity65			1
@entity69 , retreated to the sidelines chased and kicked by @entity55 players @entity76 , @entity77			0
the melee continued in the tunnel , with the @entity80 eventually needed to quell the problem			0
@entity82 , @entity84 football 's governing body , subsequently fined @entity69 $ 200,000 and banned the player for eight games , @entity65 was slapped with an eight - match suspension , @entity88 for six , @entity77 for three games and @entity76 for two			1
3 @entity92 v @entity90 , @entity32 play - off 2006 violence erupted after @entity92 missed a place in the 2006 finals after going out on the away goals rule following a 4 - 2 win in @entity99			1
players and technical staff were seen throwing punches in the tunnel as the @entity105 side ran for their lives against a torrent of @entity109 anger			0
@entity92 assistant - coach @entity110 was banned from all football for one year , while two @entity109 players , and one @entity105 , were handed six - match bans			1
@entity92 were also ordered to play their next six competitive home matches behind closed doors at neutral venues			0
have we missed a famous punch - up out ? leave your suggestions below 4 @entity123 v @entity122 , @entity124 1990 these two rivals have been involved in some juicy encounters over the years , but this is one of the most infamous			1
@entity122 defender @entity128 went in late on @entity123 's @entity129 prompting chaos , as 21 players , with @entity122 goalkeeper @entity132 proving the exception , joining in the fracas			0
remarkably nobody was sent off but the @entity136 took a dim view and deducted @entity122 two league points and @entity123 one			0
@entity122 won the match 1 - 0 and still went on to lift the title			2
5 @entity143 v @entity29 , @entity32 final 2006 the great @entity144 had led an unfancied and ageing @entity146 side to the @entity32 final			0
with the match level in extra time , the attentions of notorious @entity38 hard - man and chief agitator @entity148 finally proved too much for the @entity153 - who responded to some choice words by the @entity55 central defender by turning around and viciously head - butting his rival in the stomach			2
@entity143 eventually lost on penalties and the @entity161 playmaker bizarrely went on to be voted ' @entity162 '			0
6 @entity165 v @entity163 , @entity168 v @entity166 1974 @entity0 striker @entity165 blamed @entity163 for " taking him out " in an off the ball			0
@entity163 was not one for holding back and @entity171 , home of some famous boxing matches over the years , played host to another as these two diminutive players slugged it out like two featherweights challenging for the @entity180 world title			0
unsurprisingly both were sent off and added to their charge list by hurling their tops to the ground and walking off the pitch bare - chested			1
each player was fined £ 500 ( $ 810 ) and banned for 11 games , although shirt - throwing accounted for eight of the matches ! 7 @entity193 v @entity191 , @entity196 v @entity194 @entity32 1990 not the most violent , but certainly one of the funniest			1
the pair were sniping at each other throughout the match			0
@entity191 came in late on @entity193 , who later took his revenge with a lunge on goalkeeper @entity203			0
@entity191 took exception and , after a melee , the pair were sent off , with the @entity207 then notoriously spitting as hard as he could into the @entity209 's curly perm as the disgraced pair left the pitch			2
8 @entity12 v @entity13 , @entity15 v @entity214 @entity213 2005 punch - ups are rare in modern football , but between teammates they are non-existent			1
these two hot - heads got into a debate over @entity13 's refusal to pass bowyer the ball			2
both players had made news for their off - field activities in the past - but they took their behavior to a new low when they exchanged blows in the middle of the @entity15 half soon after @entity214 had gone 3 - 0 up			2
the pair later appeared alongside manager @entity230 to apologize for their conduct , but pointedly did not say sorry to each other			0
9 @entity234 v @entity233 , @entity235 league 2006 a mass brawl at the end of the match on the final day of the season shocked @entity235 - and resulted in a host of suspensions being handed out			2
a total of 11 players were banned for between two and 12 months for taking part in the punch - up which saw four @entity233 players receive injuries			1
the incident started with a clash between former @entity235 striker @entity250 and his marker @entity252			0
10 @entity254 v @entity255 @entity256 league 2007 @entity255 defender @entity257 did not take kindly to the seal dribble of talented teenager @entity259 - who collected the ball on the edge of the penalty area , flicked it up and performed his trademark dribble by bouncing the ball on his head as he ran towards goal			2
@entity257 crashed into him and was given a straight red card and a four - month suspension			2
other @entity255 players remonstrated angrily with @entity259 , leading to an angry pushing match which interrupted the game for five minutes			0
@entity255 coach @entity274 warned that @entity259 could get seriously injured if he tried the trick again			0
11 @entity277 v @entity276 final 2007 with @entity277 winning 2 - 1 @entity122 defender @entity278 reacted angrily to a late challenge			1
both sides had a number of @entity283 players in their line - ups and a mass brawl erupted which saw three of them , @entity122 's @entity287 , @entity278 and @entity277 's @entity288 sent off			1
@entity287 refused to leave the pitch and it needed respective managers - the hot - headed pair of @entity293 and @entity294 - to stride onto the turf and defuse the situation .			1
