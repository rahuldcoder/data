@entity0 -- look no further than the two warning flares shot up from @entity3 and @entity4 tuesday evening to understand how concerned @entity5 are about the political consequences of losing the late sen. @entity8 's seat to @entity10 @entity9			1
sen. @entity11 , @entity3 , called on his @entity5 colleagues to suspend votes on their controversial health care legislation , warning it would be wrong to try to muscle a bill through @entity17 before @entity9 was sworn into office			1
" in many ways , the campaign in @entity21 became a referendum not only on health care reform but also on the openness and integrity of our government process , " @entity11 said in a statement			0
some 500 miles to the north , @entity30 chairman @entity29 sent out an urgent plea for donations to help fund a special election next month for a state senate seat he fears losing			0
" over the past few weeks , radical right - wing activists turned @entity21 into ground zero for the @entity39 movement , and we saw a taste of what 's to come in 2010 , " @entity29 wrote			0
@entity9 's victory has changed the political narrative in 2010			1
weigh in on the election results traditionally , the president 's party loses seats in the midterm elections			0
but now there is concern among some politically savvy @entity5 who worry that the losses could be greater than originally anticipated in november all because of @entity9 's win			1
" it makes it really hard , " a senior @entity5 operative , speaking on the condition of anonymity , said tuesday evening			0
" the frustrating thing for ( @entity5 ) members is that it was preventable , it affects them and it was something that never should have gotten to this point			0
" in a matter of two weeks , @entity5 witnessed a sleeping @entity10 base come to life to rally around a little - known @entity10 candidate , who defied the odds to win the race to succeed the liberal lion from @entity21			2
and after watching two governorships slip from their grasp in november , many @entity5 have come to realize that the @entity73 public is not particularly happy with their stewardship of the nation			1
democrats have 10 months to try to regain the momentum , but the wind is now at the @entity10 ' backs , and their first legislative victory will likely be slamming the brakes on president @entity83 's signature domestic issue : health care reform			1
it is a mighty blow for a president , who just one year ago seemed unbreakable , unstoppable , unbeatable			0
@entity9 is an unlikely savior for the @entity10 , which one year ago was disoriented , disorganized and disillusioned			2
a @entity21 @entity10 has successfully brought together -- for the time being -- a party at war over the ideological purity of its membership			0
there is still discord in the @entity10 , but @entity9 's win gives @entity10 another case study in how to run a successful campaign after their two gubernatorial wins in @entity98 and @entity3			1
@entity100 's loss provides @entity5 with yet another example of how not to run a campaign after their earlier losses in @entity98 and @entity3			1
one of the biggest challenges for @entity5 is wooing back independent voters , who broke @entity9 's way tuesday to help him beat @entity100			1
" if we do n't figure out a way to talk to independent voters , we are done , " lamented another high - level @entity5 staffer , speaking freely on the condition of anonymity			0
@entity10 wake up wednesday morning with a new vigor , and @entity10 strategists vow to try to use this win to broaden a playing field that one year ago seemed unrealistic			0
the @entity10 's top target is senate majority leader @entity118 of @entity119 , who is in danger of losing re-election , according to public polls			2
but @entity10 hope tuesday 's victory also convinces some fence - sitting @entity5 to follow the leads of @entity125 of @entity126 or rep. @entity127 of @entity128 and choose to retire instead of running for re-election			2
for @entity83 , the loss will likely force him to reconsider his legislative priorities , as his support on @entity134 wanes in this midterm election year			1
conservative democrats are less likely to back him on controversial issues such as health care and cap and trade , fearing that to do so would be political suicide			0
after all , republicans were able to win @entity8 's seat by running against the @entity83 agenda .			2

@entity151 is now at the @entity10 ' backs , and they may be able to put brakes on health bill
@entity9 's win gives @entity10 another case study in how to run successful campaign
