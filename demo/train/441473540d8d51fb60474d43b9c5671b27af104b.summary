-- the @entity1 is calling on state and federal officials to stop anti-gay legal measures and to legalize same - sex marriage			1
the scientific and professional organization 's guiding body voted unanimously at its annual meeting this week in @entity9 to declare its support for " full marriage equality for same - sex couples			1
" the resolution " clarifies the @entity1 's support for same - sex marriage " in light of new research , the group said			1
a similar resolution in 2004 opposed discrimination against same - sex relationships , but refrained from a more formal policy recommendation			2
dr. @entity23 , @entity1 associate executive director , said that the timing of the resolution is an indirect result of several states ' legalization of marriage			0
" we knew that marriage benefits heterosexual people in very significant ways , but we did n't know if that would be true for same - sex couples , " said @entity23 , who is also director of the @entity1 's @entity29			1
now that six @entity38 states permit same - sex marriage , researchers have been able to conduct studies with those couples			1
the research , @entity23 said , indicates that marriage " does confer the same sense of security , support , and validation " to same - sex couples as to heterosexual ones			1
the resolution also points to evidence that ongoing political debate about marriage creates stress for gay men and lesbians and perpetuates stigmas and prejudice about their communities			0
this stress can make people physically and psychologically sick , the @entity1 says , calling the link between stress and illness " well established			0
" @entity62 , chairman of the board of the @entity63 , takes issue with the assertion that legalizing same - sex marriage would improve community acceptance of homosexuality			1
" there is no evidence that gay teens are better off in @entity73 , a state that has gay marriage , than they are in @entity75 , a state which has passed a marriage amendment defining marriage as one man and one woman , " she said in an e-mail response to @entity0			0
@entity62 continued , " the release of this statement is unfortunately going to undermine confidence in @entity1 statements generally , i would predict			0
" both the @entity63 and the @entity1 are skeptical of one solution to the gay - marriage debate : civil unions			2
@entity88 @entity63 executive director @entity87 is quoted in a press release on the @entity63 website calling the move " nothing more than a @entity93 that will usher in same - sex marriage sooner rather than later			2
" elsewhere on its website , @entity63 calls for dealing with legal and economic benefits separately from any discussion of marriage or unions			0
the @entity1 also feels that civil unions miss the mark			0
" anything other than marriage is , in essence , a stigmatization of same - sex couples			2
stigma does have negative impacts on people , " @entity23 said			0
" that 's the analysis that we 've come to and why we 've decided to support full marriage equality -- because domestic partnership or civil union will still convey the message that same - sex couples are not as good			1

@entity1 declares support for " full marriage equality "
@entity1 : studies show same - sex spouses have " sense of security , support and validation "
*traditional* marriage *advocacy* group 's chair says there 's " no evidence " for findings
