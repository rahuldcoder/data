-- the most insistent political question of the past four years has been : how can more @entity2 get access to medical care ? the federal response was the @entity6			1
better known as " @entity6 , " it is a complex mix of insurance changes and tax credits			2
when the act takes effect on january 1 , 2014 , it will provide access to insurance to about 30 million people who currently do n't have it			2
unfortunately , that was the wrong question			0
so the looming " answer " is wrong as well			0
here 's the right question : how can we improve medical care so that it 's worth extending it to more people ? in other words , how can we create a health care system that helps people become and stay healthy ? i have argued for years that we do not have a health care system in @entity2			1
we have a disease - management system -- one that depends on ruinously expensive drugs and surgeries that treat health conditions after they manifest rather than giving our citizens simple diet , lifestyle and therapeutic tools to keep them healthy			1
@entity0 special report : " @entity40 " the brutal fact is that we spend more on health care than any other country -- an estimated $ 9,348 per capita in 2013 -- and get shockingly little for our money			1
the @entity2 " currently ranks lowest on a variety of health measures , " concludes a new report from an expert panel commissioned by the @entity47			2
specifically , @entity2 have more obesity , more sexually transmitted diseases , shorter life expectancies and higher infant mortality than the inhabitants of nearly all of the 16 developed " peer " countries studied			0
why ? a major culprit is a medical system based on maximizing profits rather than fostering good health			1
i am not against all forms of high - tech medicine			2
drugs and surgeries have a secure place in the treatment of serious health conditions			2
but modern @entity2 medicine treats almost every health condition as if it were an emergency			0
this leads to vast wealth for the corporate medical complex but poor health outcomes and empty wallets for the patients			1
making this system more accessible by passing costs to taxpayers will simply spread its failures more broadly			0
the medical philosophy known as integrative medicine offers a better alternative			0
as defined by the @entity84 at the @entity47 , @entity83 combines mainstream medical therapies and complementary and alternative therapies " for which there is some high - quality scientific evidence of safety and effectiveness			1
" it uses high - tech medicine sparingly to treat the most serious conditions while employing nutrition , exercise , stress - reduction and other simple , low - cost ( or free ) interventions to foster long - term health and resilience			1
it 's one thing to read about the horrors of the modern medical system			1
it 's quite another to see them vividly displayed in the faces and bodies of suffering @entity2			0
i was honored to be interviewed for the documentary " @entity40 : the fight to @entity109 , " premiering at 8 and 11 p.m. et sunday , march 10 , on @entity0			1
the film offers an unflinching look at the causes and effects of our medical system 's problems and provides some hopeful solutions			1
highlights include : -- the torturous journey of sgt. @entity120 , an injured veteran wounded in @entity121			0
he was prescribed a shopping bag full of prescription medications that left him broken and miserable in body , mind and spirit			0
watching @entity120 begins to regain his health through gentle , low - cost therapies , including meditation and acupuncture , is profoundly moving			2
-- a look at the revolutionary @entity133			0
it gives the supermarket chain 's employees financial incentives for taking responsibility for their own health , decreasing @entity133 's insurance costs significantly while improving participants ' well - being			1
-- the dramatic story of dr. @entity144 , an @entity145 primary care physician fed up with being pushed to treat patients faster and faster to boost clinic profits			2
she enrolled in the @entity148 for @entity150 's @entity149 to find a better way , explaining that " i 'm not interested in getting my productivity up -- i 'm interested in helping patients			0
" the film takes its name from the practice of setting a small fire to clear out nearby brush , allowing a fast - advancing forest fire to pass by harmlessly			0
will we be sufficiently clear - eyed and rational to take a similarly bold action to avoid disaster wrought by our dysfunctional health care system ? i hope so			1
in the film , i say , " the present system does n't work , and it 's going to take us down			0
we need a whole new kind of medicine			0
" i am grateful to filmmakers @entity169 and @entity171 for making that case in this persuasive and eloquent documentary			0
please tune in to @entity0 sunday evening			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity176 .			2
