@entity0 -- @entity5 's ex-wife @entity4 is set to testify in the @entity7 wrongful death trial wednesday , lawyers for the concert promoter said monday			1
@entity4 is expected to be questioned about @entity5 's drug use during the 1990s when she traveled with him , married him and bore his two oldest children			1
she will be called as the next witness in the @entity0 courtroom after an economics expert concludes his testimony aboutÂ the financial support @entity5 would have provided his mother and @entity16 had he not died four years ago			1
@entity5 's youngest brother made an unsuccessful effort to reach the singer in his last weeks because of family concerns about his drug use , according to testimony friday			1
lawyers for the concert promoter accused of liability in @entity5 's death want to show that the pop icon was a secretive drug addict who was even beyond his family 's help			1
jurors watched video of @entity32 's questioning by the @entity7 lawyers about failed interventions he led because of his concerns about @entity5 's use of painkillers in the last decade of his brother 's life			1
@entity5 died from an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol that a doctor told police he was using to treat his insomnia as he rehearsed for a comeback tour four years ago			2
@entity5 's mother and three children are suing the concert promoter , contending it negligently hired , retained or supervised the doctor convicted of involuntary manslaughter in his death			1
@entity32 testified that he and his father , @entity53 , were turned away from the gates of @entity5 's rented @entity0 mansion on @entity56 , the home in which he died weeks later			1
they were concerned because of " reports to me that he did n't look too good , " he said			0
who is @entity4 ? " after i had heard this , i said , ' come on , let 's go			1
we 're going over there , ' " he testified			0
other witnesses , including @entity5 's makeup artist and the show director , have testified that @entity5 suffered physical deterioration in the last two months of his life			1
" there was a drug issue , " @entity32 said , explaining why they wanted to reach him			1
" he was n't eating			0
all of these things were happening at the same and , you know , a lot of pressure			0
" he said he wanted to persuade his brother to leave rehearsals and enter a drug rehab program in @entity81			2
" of course my brother would n't let me through because he would n't want me to see him like that , " he said			0
the security guard told him his brother was not at home , he said			0
@entity5 lawyers do not dispute that @entity5 had a drug dependency problem at times , but they say he went long periods of time without taking painkillers			1
the entertainer publicly acknowledged his dependency when he cut short his dangerous tour to enter a rehab program in 1993			0
the drug use was connected to two decades of pain stemming from scalp burns suffered while filming a @entity102 commercial and several onstage accidents on tour , they say			0
he also used prescription sedatives to help him sleep , especially during the pressure of touring , they argue			0
the pressure was on again as @entity5 prepared for his " @entity113 " concerts set to debut in @entity112 in july 2009 , they say			2
@entity5 was getting nightly infusions of propofol in a desperate effort to cure his insomnia , which a sleep expert testified disrupted his natural sleep cycles and caused his physical and mental decline			2
@entity7 executives created an ethical conflict of interest by hiring dr. @entity125 as @entity5 's full - time physician for $ 150,000 a month , the @entity5 lawsuit contends			1
@entity125 could not refuse @entity5 's demands for propofol infusions since he was deeply in debt and could not risk being fired from the lucrative job , they argue			1
jury applauds witness in trial @entity7 lawyers say it was @entity5 who chose and controlled @entity125 , not the company , and they had no way of knowing about the dangerous treatments he was giving the singer in the privacy of his bedroom			1
while @entity32 was questioned for several hours by @entity7 lawyers , only about an hour of the video was shown to jurors friday			1
most of it focused on his repeated attempts to interrupt his brother 's use of painkillers			2
" i wrote letters to my family about his problem and that we had to do something to help , " @entity32 testified			1
the letters would tell his parents , brothers and sisters that ' he 's an addict , ' and at this point , addicts are n't so responsible for what they do			2
so this is where the family needs to step in and do something about it because their desire becomes physical			0
" @entity5 testified that he " staged several interventions , " including in @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity0			2
" four or five " of those attempted interventions were at @entity5 's @entity174 between 2004 and 2006 -- around the time of the child abuse trial in @entity177 , @entity178 , he said			1
@entity5 's ' pajama day ' in court @entity32 said he was able to get his brother off of drugs at one point , but he resumed just before the child molestation trial began in a @entity186 , @entity178 , courtroom in 2004			1
" he was really scared			0
" he fired @entity5 nanny @entity187 because he suspected she was supplying his drugs , he said			2
" whenever she 's around , he 's wasted			0
" he asked older sister @entity189 to stay close to their brother , he said , telling her , " make sure you watch everything he does , because i have to get him in this courtroom every day and see this thing through			0
" @entity32 gave new insight into what happened that infamous day of the trial when @entity5 showed up late for court wearing pajamas			1
at the time , the singer blamed a back injury suffered when he fell in the shower , which sent him to a hospital that morning			0
ex-bodyguard testifies about singer 's drug use his brother testified , however , it was " because he did n't want to go to court			1
" " i went to the hospital and he said to me , he says , ' i do n't know what you 're thinking			0
i 'm not walking into that courtroom , so do n't even think about it , @entity32 , ' " he testified			2
" and i said , ' ok			0
' i said , ' but you 're going to court			0
' he goes , ' no , i 'm not			0
' " @entity32 blamed the nanny for supplying " some kind of patch " that had drugs			2
@entity5 also described an incident in which his brother had a bad reaction to a sedative while at a @entity227 home in 2005			2
the nanny called him , saying , " you need to get over here			0
something 's not right , " he testified			0
a doctor who lived nearby paid a house call and treated him , he said			0
he said his brother would " kind of hide from me " because he did n't want him to know about his drug use , @entity5 said			1
monday is the start of the 16th week of testimony in the trial , which the judge told jurors could last until the end of september .			0
