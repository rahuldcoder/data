@entity0 -- a novel skin graft treatment appears to be working for a 3 - year - old @entity6 girl burned over 80 % of her body in january , a spokeswoman for her family said tuesday			1
a medical team led by reconstructive surgeon @entity9 spent four hours monday night removing wrappings from @entity12 's body , according to spokeswoman @entity13			1
they found that 90 % of the skin graft -- cloned in a @entity17 laboratory and then rushed to @entity6 last week -- appears to be taking , she said			1
the little girl , who was burned in a @entity19 barbecuing accident at home , remains sedated , said @entity22 , who is representing the family and @entity24 , the @entity25 company that produced the cloned skin graft that 's being used to treat her			1
the plan is to gradually wake @entity29 and remove her from a ventilator by thursday , @entity22 said			1
while complications and other setbacks remain a possibility , @entity22 said pippi could be well enough to begin physical therapy and rehabilitation by next week			1
@entity29 's ordeal began on @entity19 when she was playing outside as her father , @entity37 , prepared a barbeque using a highly flammable liquid gel			0
as he lit the gel , its container exploded and covered @entity29 's small body			0
she screamed as her skin burned and " bubbled , " according to her mother , @entity46			0
the toddler suffered third - degree burns on 80 % of her body			1
afterward , she was struck with four cardiac arrests , kidney failures , collapsed lungs and multiple infections			0
her critical condition eventually stabilized under the care of @entity56 and others at the @entity58 in @entity0			0
but the @entity59 were uncomfortable with their options for healing her skin : temporarily using skin from a cadaver or from a pig , or taking her small portion of undamaged skin and grafting it elsewhere			2
" please do n't take the perfect skin , just give me a week to find something else , " @entity46 begged of @entity56			2
after days on the @entity70 and hours reaching out to reconstructive specialists in the @entity17 , @entity29 's mother discovered @entity24 , whose specialty is growing layers of human skin by cloning a 2 - square - centimeter sample from a patient			2
doctors in the @entity17 performed the process -- called a cultured epidermal autograft -- more than 100 times in last year , according to @entity24			2
however , because the new skin must be administered within 24 hours of leaving the lab , the procedure has n't been attempted much farther away			0
it had never before been attempted in @entity6			0
the procedure , which is being covered by local medical coverage and donations , cost $ 82,000			0
