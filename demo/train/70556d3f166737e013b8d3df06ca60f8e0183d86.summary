-- in the two - hour season premiere of " @entity3 , " there is an incidental character , an old woman , who is probably pushing 90			1
her clothes are proper , if drab , and her demeanor suggests someone to the manner born			0
she seems like the type of person who has spent her life in privileged drawing rooms above @entity16 , her feet never touching the dirty streets of @entity19 as the 20th century went by			0
indeed , she 's lived through so much in the 1960s alone : communications breakthroughs , space flight , social movements			2
and yet , it appears the decade has n't affected her at all			0
she has a good deal in common with " @entity3 's " major characters			1
the @entity28 show , about a 1960s advertising agency , returns sunday for its sixth season			1
buzz abounds for the return of ' @entity3 ' forget about the civil rights marches , the @entity35 protests , the youth culture and all the rest that 's become shorthand for " the ' 60s			1
" from their @entity41 aerie , the characters of " @entity3 " have glided over a good deal of it			1
sure , there have been occasional glimpses of those turbulent times			0
creative director @entity46 used to have a lover in the beatnik precincts of @entity49 , even lived there himself for awhile			0
office manager @entity53 ' husband was sent off to ' @entity54			0
copywriter @entity55 remains a proudly independent single woman			0
former copywriter @entity57 went off to register black voters in the @entity59			0
the office went into shock when @entity62 was shot ( though they were just as shocked by the lawnmower that ran over an executive 's foot )			2
but , essentially , the messy ' 60s have been lived by someone else			2
and why not ? the " @entity3 " are in advertising			1
their lives are about new - and - improved consumer products , tropical getaways and the wonders of better living through chemistry -- not hippies , war and drugs			2
their ' 60s are not the ' 60s we 've come to know , says @entity81 , a history professor at @entity83 's @entity82			1
" you ca n't understand the 1960s if you only focus on hippies , " he says			0
" that 's obviously a part of the 1960s but not the full 1960s			2
" after all , he points out , most people of the time went to work and lived their lives -- and were n't attired in tie - dye and love beads			2
your photos : what the late ' 60s really looked like one of the smart moves of the show , he adds , is that the " @entity3 " characters do n't have to be immersed in the times			1
they just have to be keen observers			0
" @entity46 does n't necessarily have to become a hippie himself to sell being a hippie , or sell an @entity106 that is changing in ways he 's trying to understand , " he says			2
" he can be of it , but not necessarily in it			0
" surfaces and shadows from the beginning , " @entity3 " has tended to view the ' 60s from the establishment 's perch			1
@entity3 -- the first incarnation of the show 's ad agency -- was part of the clubby @entity122 set , its ranks filled with @entity124 and @entity126 commuters			1
even the new incarnation , @entity128 , is more staid than swinging			0
it 's been the ad agency of @entity131 and @entity132 ( and , if a contract alluded to last season worked out , napalm - maker @entity135 )			1
its staffers are generally a generation older than the baby boomers and have a stake in preserving the status quo			2
the insurgents were its competition , such as @entity145 and @entity146 , the real - life agencies that shook up @entity122 with irreverent work and ethnically diverse staffs			0
the show 's shiny surfaces appear to have distracted many viewers from " @entity3 's " shadows , something that leaves creator @entity155 bemused			1
the first season included a suicide and @entity46 's desperate identity crisis , and succeeding seasons have n't let up			1
" there 's been an interesting experience for me to hear people talk with nostalgia about the early seasons of the show , " he says			1
" i think season 1 was the darkest thing that 's ever been a commercial success			1
" there may be a reckoning coming now , though			0
the late ' 60s were so filled with turmoil it seems impossible to avoid the fire this time			1
season 5 ended in spring 1967 ; over the next 18 months came race riots , the @entity177 assassination , a clamorous presidential campaign , the @entity180 assassination and the war , the war , the war			1
closer to " @entity3 's " @entity19 home , in 1968 , mayor @entity186 's administration was beset by a teachers ' strike , a garbage strike and a general sense of rot later immortalized in such films as " @entity193 " and " @entity194			1
" it was , in columnist @entity197 's sarcastic phrase , " @entity198			2
" " @entity3 " character @entity199 -- a @entity200 adviser -- will likely have a lot on his plate this season			1
@entity204 is not mad at ' @entity3 ' ' week of shock , ' world of wonders but even with all that , the world rolled on			1
take the april 12 , 1968 , issue of @entity211 , the publication that @entity81 , the history professor , describes as reflecting " what @entity106 was really about			2
" " week of shock , " blared the cover line over a photograph of the rev. @entity177 , who had just been killed			0
inside : articles on @entity177 's death , @entity221 's march 31 speech announcing he was not running for president , @entity224 challengers @entity180 and @entity225 and a piece on the @entity227 , " the kings of acid rock			0
" but also : ads for @entity232 televisions , @entity234 tires , @entity235 , @entity237 's ketchup , the @entity239 automakers and " the friendly world of @entity241 , " all the sunny , capitalistic wonders of life			0
this is the world of surfaces , the one most people take refuge in			0
" ( ' @entity3 ' ) shows us that @entity106 capitalism rolls on regardless of the era that it is in , " @entity81 says			1
" it will try to sell that culture and commodify that culture			0
that 's what the @entity3 are doing			1
" that 's not to say the characters wo n't be affected by the coming calamities			1
the cast members lightly allude to changes			0
@entity261 , who plays @entity46 , says the show will get to the heart of the loaded question that ended last season : @entity46 , approached by two women at a bar , being asked , " are you alone ? " @entity269 , who plays the wisecracking agency head @entity270 , says his character -- who ended last season nakedly enjoying an lsd trip -- could reassess his whole life			1
" i think at this semi-late date in his career he 's trying to shake it up and find something to be interested in , " he says			0
" that 's really all you can ask -- surprisingly i think he 's the character that appears to be most open to that			1
" living large in @entity46 's @entity19 ' where we are right now ' but @entity81 doubts the group is suddenly going to bolt the establishment			2
" in the back of many fans ' minds ( there 's the thought that ) this is the year , this is the season we 're going to see them become complete hippies			2
it 's not going to happen , " he says			0
" @entity155 's too smart for that			0
he wants to show that this other ' 60s -- this corporate ' 60s -- adjusted to the new 1960s and ended up selling the new 1960s			1
" given that , can " @entity3 's " characters stay disengaged ? @entity301 , forever cagey about revealing too much , suggests they wo n't -- and that what they go through will echo down to the present day			1
" i think you 'll find this season more than ever really interacts where we are right now in society , " he says			0
he leaves the point hanging , of course , but it 's easy to see what the show might address : the splintering of society , destructive politics , what the baby boomers wrought			2
but maybe " @entity3 's " characters will still muddle through , mildly oblivious to the deeper currents of the age			1
in that , they would n't be so different from the old woman -- or the rest of us			0
@entity81 mentions a student he once had , another old woman , who took a course about the decade			0
he guesses she was born around 1930 , and nothing he showed the class -- including movies such as " @entity331 " and documentaries about ' 60s movements -- seemed to reach her			2
finally , @entity81 grew upset at her indifference			0
" what were you doing during the 1960s ? " he asked tartly			0
" raising my children , " she responded .			0

" @entity3 " returns for sixth season on sunday
show 's ad agency characters have generally avoided ' 60s turmoil
season 5 ended in spring 1967 ; new season will likely take show into harsh 1968
will " @entity3 " go *anti-establishment* ? doubtful -- they are the establishment
