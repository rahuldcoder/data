-- it sounds like something out of a sci - fi movie : a patient visits a doctor 's office and , after a brief surgical procedure , walks away with a microchip under her skin that delivers medication in precisely timed and measured doses			1
that scenario does n't seem so futuristic anymore			0
researchers at the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) announced today that they have successfully completed the first trial of a drug - releasing microchip in humans			1
the results were published on the website of the journal @entity20			0
the pacemaker - sized microchip devices , which were implanted near the waistline of seven 60 - something women in @entity25 , worked as intended , releasing up to 19 daily doses of an osteoporosis drug that ordinarily requires injections			1
the implants proved safe , and tests revealed that they delivered the medication as effectively as once - a - day shots			1
@entity0 : how to fight osteoporosis the devices wo n't be ready for mainstream use for at least another four years			1
but the researchers say the technology will ultimately enable people who take injectable drugs for conditions such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis to swap their needles for microchips			1
other drugs that could potentially be delivered in this manner include chemotherapy , fertility hormones , and vaccines , they say			1
" it 's almost like ' @entity58 , ' but now it 's coming to life , " says study coauthor @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , an institute professor at @entity13 's @entity54 , in @entity55 , @entity56			1
@entity51 , a chemical engineer , came up with the idea for the drug - delivery device about 15 years ago , while watching a tv show on how microchips are made in the computer industry			1
@entity51 and his colleagues at @entity13 worked on the idea throughout the 1990s , and published the first paper on their research in 1999			1
that same year , @entity51 cofounded a privately held company , @entity69 , to license the technology from @entity13 and commercialize the device			1
@entity0 : injecting yourself 101 here 's how it works : microchips containing tiny reservoirs of concentrated , freeze - dried medication are secured to the surface of a titanium housing , which also contains a wireless transmitter that communicates with a small portable computer			2
a surgeon implants the device via a one - inch incision , in an outpatient procedure requiring local anesthesia only			2
each reservoir on the microchip holds a single dose of medication and is sealed by a thin metal membrane			2
when instructed by the computer , the implant sends an electrical current through a membrane and melts it , allowing body fluids to flow into the reservoir and the powdered drug to diffuse into the body			2
( the melted metal resolidifies on the chip and is not released			0
) in the recently completed trial , the microchips were loaded with @entity102 ( teriparatide ) , a drug used to build bone mass in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis			1
the study participants carried the implants for a total of 103 days , and received medication on 20 of those days			0
overall , the devices successfully released 94 % of the doses as planned			2
@entity0 : 11 foods for healthy bones one implant malfunctioned due to a faulty microchip circuit , but the researchers caught the problem thanks to the wireless transmitter , says @entity121 , the president and ceo of @entity69			1
" the on - board diagnostics allowed us to identify right away ... that the drug could not be released , " @entity121 says			1
" there were no safety concerns to the patient and we decided not to include [ her ] in the study , as our study objective was on safety and efficacy			0
" the study participants were reportedly untroubled by the device			0
" they found the implants pretty much acceptable , " @entity121 says			0
" they could not feel the device once it was implanted , and they all indicated they would be willing to repeat the procedure			2
" the fact that several of the women said they forgot about the implant once their incision healed is a " good sign , " says @entity148 , @entity149 , a professor of bioengineering at the @entity151			2
@entity148 adds , however , that the microchip system may not be for everyone			2
the quality of life of people who take injectable medications " varies very broadly , " says @entity148 , who coauthored an editorial accompanying the study			0
" some people say ' i just do n't want an incision ' -- so they could opt out easily and elect another approach			0
on the other hand , there would be some people who would say ' i want this ' because [ they ] want it to be forgettable , sort of like a pacemaker			0
" @entity0 : prescription drugs that lead double lives more research and fine - tuning will be needed before the device can even be tested in full - fledged clinical trials , @entity148 says			0
the researchers need to establish that it 's durable and reliable , for instance			0
@entity51 and his colleagues say their implants could be used for brief stretches of 30 to 90 days ( to administer pain medication after an injury , say ) , or for periods of up to a year			0
" we think 365 doses is very manageable with the design that we 're working on , " says @entity121 , noting that @entity69 is currently developing a one - year @entity102 implant			0
@entity187 , @entity188 , the director of clinical immunology and rheumatology at the @entity191 at @entity192 , in @entity193 , says microchip devices could be a boon for people -- such as rheumatoid arthritis patients -- who require regular injections or intravenous infusions			1
@entity0 : alternative therapies for rheumatoid arthritis " patients tend to do ok , but there are some that absolutely hate [ injections ] , " @entity187 says			0
some patients complain that the medicine burns , and some experience so - called injection site reactions in which the surrounding skin becomes red and swollen , he explains			1
patient comfort and convenience are n't the only potential benefits of microchips , @entity121 says			0
the automatic dosing ensures that people receive the medication exactly as prescribed , so doctors and patients do n't have to worry about skipped or inconsistent doses , he says			0

researchers at @entity13 completed first trial of drug - releasing microchip in human patients
pacemaker - sized microchip devices were implanted in seven 60 - something women
