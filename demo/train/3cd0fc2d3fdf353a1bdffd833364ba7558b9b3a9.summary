if you 're rich and want to give money to a lot of political campaigns , the @entity0 ruled wednesday that you can			1
the 5 - 4 ruling eliminated limits on how much money people can donate in total in one election season			1
however , the decision left intact the current $ 5,200 limit on how much an individual can give to any single candidate during a two - year election cycle			1
until now , an individual donor could give up to $ 123,200 per cycle			2
the ruling means a wealthy liberal or conservative donor can give as much money as desired to federal election candidates across the country , as long as no candidate receives more than the $ 5,200 cap			1
while most people lack the money to make such a large total donation to election campaigns , the ruling clears the way for more private money to enter the system			1
in effect , it expands the loosening of campaign finance laws that occurred with the high court 's @entity37 decision in 2010 that eased campaign spending by outside groups			1
are campaign donations a form of free speech ? at issue was whether limits in the @entity47 on overall -- or aggregate -- campaign spending by individuals violate the @entity53 rights of contributors			2
" we conclude that the aggregate limits on contributions do not further the only governmental interest this court accepted as legitimate " in a 1976 ruling , said chief justice @entity55 , who wrote the opinion of the court 's conservative majority			2
" they instead intrude without justification on a citizen 's ability to exercise the most fundamental @entity53 activities			0
" in dissent , justice @entity70 said the majority opinion will have the effect of creating " huge loopholes in the law ; and that undermines , perhaps devastates , what remains of campaign finance reform			1
" @entity80 leaders hailed the decision as an affirmation of free expression rights			0
" it does not permit one more dime to be given to an individual candidate or a party -- it just respects the constitutional rights of individuals to decide how many to support , " said @entity85 leader @entity84 of @entity86			2
however , congressional supporters of tougher campaign finance laws expressed concern about more private money influencing elections			1
" i am concerned that today 's ruling may represent the latest step in an effort by a majority of the court to dismantle entirely the longstanding structure of campaign finance law erected to limit the undue influence of special interests on @entity111 politics , " said @entity98 sen. @entity98 of @entity99 , a longtime proponent of campaign finance reform			1
new campaign finance reform ? some legislators called for new campaign finance legislation in response to the ruling , but such reforms appeared impossible in an election year			1
sen. @entity119 of @entity120 , the @entity121 chairman of the @entity122 , said he would hold a hearing on the impact of " alarming @entity0 decisions that have eviscerated our campaign finance laws			1
" another top @entity85 @entity128 , @entity129 of @entity130 , warned of further erosion of limits on special interest influence in elections			0
" this in itself is a small step , but another step on the road to ruination , " @entity129 said			0
" it could lead to interpretations of the law that would result in the end of any fairness in the political system as we know it			0
" the case involved @entity148 , the owner of an @entity150 electrical engineering company , with support from the @entity152			0
they objected to a 1970s @entity155 - era law restricting someone from giving no more than $ 48,600 to federal candidates , and $ 74,600 to political action committees during a two - year election cycle , for a maximum of $ 123,200			1
@entity148 argued he had a constitutional right to donate more than that amount to as many office seekers as he wanted , as long as no single candidate got more than the $ 5,200 per election limit ( $ 2,600 for a primary election and another $ 2,600 for a general election )			1
" spending money on advertising , promoting ideas and supporting candidates is an exercise of our right to freedom of speech , " @entity148 told @entity168 on wednesday after the ruling came out			0
preventing corruption supporters of the limits struck down wednesday said the law prevented corruption or the appearance of corruption			0
without the limits , they argued , one well - heeled donor could in theory contribute to every federal race possible			2
the ruling leaves in place current donor limits to individual candidates , and donor disclosure requirements by candidates , political parties , and political action committees			2
" what i think this means is that freedom of speech is being upheld , " said @entity197 speaker @entity196 , an @entity198 @entity80			0
" you all have the freedom to write what you want to write			0
donors ought to have the freedom to give what they want to give			2
" but supporters of the limits expressed disappointment			0
" the @entity0 majority continued on its march to destroy the nation 's campaign finance laws , which were enacted to prevent corruption and protect the integrity of our democracy , " said @entity211 president @entity210 , a longtime advocate for election money reforms			1
" the court re-created the system of legalized bribery today that existed during the @entity155 days			0
" @entity224 passed the individual aggregate limits in the wake of the @entity155 , and the @entity0 upheld them in 1976			1
the separate @entity37 case in 2010 dealt with campaign spending by outside groups seeking to influence federal elections			0
in that case , the conservative majority -- citing free speech concerns -- eased longstanding restrictions on campaign spending by corporations , labor unions , and certain nonprofit advocacy groups			0
the @entity37 ruling helped open the floodgates to massive corporate spending in the 2012 elections			0
it also led to further litigation seeking to loosen current restrictions on both spending and donations			0
what the ruling on campaign money means			2

@entity0 lifts limits on how much in total one person can donate
its 5 - 4 ruling means wealthy donors can give to as many campaigns as they want
people can still only give a maximum of $ 5,200 to a single candidate
*critics* warn the ruling further undermines already weakened campaign finance laws
