-- could your smartphone really give you a lethal electric shock ? that question was on the minds of many monday amid news that @entity7 is investigating the death of a woman in @entity10 whose family said she was electrocuted after answering a call on her @entity13 while the device was recharging			1
the death of @entity16 , 23 , was first reported sunday by @entity10 's @entity17			1
citing police reports and social media posts by @entity16 's family , @entity17 reported that @entity16 , who lived in @entity10 's western @entity22 region , collapsed to the floor thursday after using her @entity13 5 while the battery was being charged			1
" we are deeply saddened to learn of this tragic incident and offer our condolences to the @entity20			2
we will fully investigate and cooperate with authorities in this matter , " @entity7 said in a statement sent to @entity0 and other news agencies			0
details of @entity16 's death remain sketchy			1
local police confirmed that @entity16 died of electrocution , but as of sunday had yet to verify that her phone was involved in the incident , @entity17 reported			1
@entity0 has not been able to independently confirm the report			0
but the news raises questions about the potential electrical hazards of devices many of us carry at almost all times			0
experts say the likelihood of someone being electrocuted by a smartphone , even while the device is charging , is very , very low			0
for one , phones charged from a usb cord have a supply voltage of about 5 volts , not enough to severely harm a person			0
" we have seen very few incidents related to shock or electrocution ( involving cell phones ) , " said @entity55 , communications director for the @entity56			0
" most of our attention has been on overheating , smoke or fire			0
" but the risks become greater when someone powers a phone with a substandard or incompatible charger			0
some knockoff chargers do n't have proper insulation , potentially exposing users to overheating , fire or electric shock			1
in a recent online post , the @entity76 warned about that country 's market being flooded with counterfeit chargers that could potentially turn a phone into a " grenade			2
" " stick to the company that made your phone when you 're buying replacement products , " @entity55 said			0
it 's not clear what kind of charger @entity16 was using , although her sister said she had bought her phone in december at an official @entity7 store and was using the original charger to recharge the device when the incident occurred , according to a post on @entity98 , a @entity10 microblogging site that is similar to @entity99			1
mixing smartphones with water is another safety concern			2
@entity16 's family said online that she left the bath to answer the phone			1
water is an excellent conductor of electricity , and moisture on the skin can lower a person 's natural resistance to electric shock , experts say			1
also , electrical shocks involving consumer electronics often have nothing to do with the devices themselves			0
instead , they can be caused by overloaded power outlets , frayed extension cords or faulty wiring in a home , experts say			0
@entity55 said @entity126 consumers have reported a few isolated cases of phones smoking or catching fire while recharging			2
when it comes to cell phones and safety , the majority of problems have involved phone batteries that burst or catch fire under heat or pressure , he said			2
" this is not the week to leave your cell phone in the car , " said @entity55 , referring to the heat wave that 's embroiled much of the country			1
still , he said , " it is a rare occurrence for there to be a safety incident with a cell phone			2
