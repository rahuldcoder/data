-- the @entity2 sisters cruised into the second round of the @entity4 but their fellow former world no. 1 @entity5 became the highest - profile casualty of the women 's draw in @entity9			1
@entity10 and @entity11 champion @entity2 defied windy conditions to thrash fellow @entity14 @entity13 6 - 1 6 - 1 in just 55 minutes on tuesday to set up a match against experienced @entity17 @entity16			2
" the match was so weird , the conditions were so tough , i could n't really play my game			0
she could n't really play her game			0
it 's not the best opportunity to grade yourself , " said fourth seed @entity2 , who also beat 2008 @entity4 girls ' champion @entity13 in the final of the @entity27 tournament in july before heading back to @entity10 for @entity28			1
@entity2 won the @entity4 for the third time in 2008 , and older sibling @entity33 is seeking to match that feat. the 32 - year - old , unseeded after falling to 46th in the rankings after being diagnosed an auto - immune disease this time last year , began her bid by beating compatriot @entity40 6 - 3 6 - 1			1
" there comes a point when you have to start realizing you ca n't play through everything , " said @entity2 , who next faces a tough test in the form of @entity45 sixth seed @entity43			1
" for me that 's been just about a year , year and a half that i 've finally gotten smart			0
" @entity52 , who beat @entity33 in @entity53 and then at the @entity11 , thrashed @entity55 's @entity54 6 - 2 6 - 0			2
" i have to put a lot of balls in the court and execute my game well if i want to win against her , " @entity2 said			1
@entity5 has dropped from the top of the rankings to ninth since last year 's @entity4 , and the @entity65 's hopes of winning a first grand slam title seem further away than ever			1
she reached the @entity9 final in 2009 , but on tuesday lost 6 - 2 6 - 2 to 96th - ranked @entity69 @entity68 to suffer her second successive first - round exit at a grand slam			1
" i think it 's a temporary issue , " said the 22 - year - old , who played with a strapped knee after pulling out during hersemifinal at last week 's @entity76 tournament			0
" hopefully it will get better quickly			0
it 's frustrating to have some injuries , but it happens to everyone			0
it 's just about moving on			0
" @entity68 , who turned 22 on sunday , was the @entity84 's newcomer of the year in 2011 but has dropped from a career - high ranking of 38th			0
she will next play 58th - ranked @entity17 @entity86 , who reached the third round last year			2
former @entity89 champion @entity88 was the other big name to depart on tuesday as the @entity92 22nd seed lost to @entity14 teenager @entity93 -- touted by many as the natural successor to the @entity2 sisters			1
@entity93 will next play 141st - ranked @entity45 @entity97 , who reached the second round in @entity9 for the first time			1
the 19 - year - old has surged up the rankings to 44th , building on her third - round achievement at last year 's @entity4 with a similar showing at @entity10 and a last - 16 appearance at @entity89			1
@entity107 second seed @entity105 needed just 54 minutes to dispatch @entity109 debutant @entity108 6 - 1 6 - 1			1
the @entity10 finalist has lost in the second round at @entity112 for the past three years , and this time faces unseeded @entity17 @entity114 -- who reached the last 16 in 2011			2
" i 'm just very happy that i could give it my best in the first match			0
it 's always difficult for the first match , " said the 23 - year - old , whose younger sister @entity121 lost to @entity92 20th seed @entity122			2
" it 's always a bit harder because the people expect you to play well and go far in the tournament			0
but i 'm just trying not to really think about pressure and just do my best			0
" former world no. 1 @entity129 beat @entity131 @entity130 6 - 3 6 - 3 to set up a clash with @entity134 's @entity133			1
the @entity136 12th seed has never been past the fourth round in @entity9 , her worst showing at the four grand slams			1
" my big goal is to break the fourth round and get into quarterfinals			0
obviously that 's something i 'm working hard			0
it 's not easy , but i really tried to focus on taking it one match at a time , because sometimes when you get overexcited it does n't really work for you the way you hope for , " she said			0
@entity14 21st seed @entity150 exited , losing 6 - 4 4 - 6 6 - 3 to 20 - year - old @entity152 debutant @entity151 , while @entity154 no. 29 @entity153 and @entity156 's no. 32 @entity155 also departed .			2
