-- secretary of defense @entity1 says there is no question that the @entity4 is safer with @entity5 , the architect of @entity6 , dead , but contends there is no " silver bullet " to destroy the terror network			1
@entity1 's assessment came just days before the one - year anniversary of the @entity4 commando raid on @entity5 's compound in @entity14 , @entity15 , that ended a manhunt for the @entity6 founder that began following the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks			1
" having been involved in operations even before @entity5 , it was clear that there is no kind of silver bullet here to suddenly be able to destroy @entity6 and that includes going after @entity5 , " @entity1 told reporters friday after a meeting with defense counterparts in @entity22			2
" the way this works is that the more successful we are in taking down those that represent their spiritual and ideological leadership , the greater our ability to weaken their threat to this country			0
" the @entity40 and the @entity41 last week warned of the possibility of terrorist attacks leading up to and after the anniversary of the may 2 , 2011 , killing of @entity5			2
there is no specific , credible terror threat , the agencies said			0
the warning , released by the @entity40 and @entity41 , says individuals have posted messages on " violent extremist web forums " vowing attacks on the @entity4 around the anniversary , but adds that " such threats are almost certainly aspirational			2
" " i do n't think there 's any question that @entity22 is safer as a result of the @entity5 operation , " @entity1 said			1
" ... it does n't mean that they do n't remain a threat			0
it does n't mean that we somehow do n't have the responsibility to keep going after them wherever they are			0
" he described the raid that he oversaw as the then - @entity71 director as " tense , " with several " nerve - wracking moments			1
" @entity1 recalled the moment during the raid when one of two helicopters used by @entity77 crashed at @entity5 's compound in @entity14 , @entity15			1
" just the fact that having those helicopters going 150 miles into @entity15 and the concern about whether or not they would be detected			2
and then actually going in to the compound when one of the helicopters went down because of the heat coming off the ground			0
it was just hotter than anybody had anticipated			0
and obviously that was pretty nerve - wracking , " he said			1
" ... fortunately , we had a back - up helicopter that came in and was able to pick up the people that were there			0
" the biggest question during the operation , @entity1 said , was " whether or not @entity5 was really there			1
" " we had no specific information that he was actually located there			0
all we had was , you know , just a lot of circumstantial intelligence and information			0
but all of us were , were kind of holding our breath to find out whether or not he was actually there			0
" the answer came about 20 minutes after the @entity77 entered the @entity5 compound , with the utterance of the code word " @entity113			2
" " there was a huge sigh of relief by everybody involved in that , " he said			0
while many details of the raid are known , questions remain about how @entity5 could have been in living for years in a compound that was only a mile from the @entity124 in @entity14 , a largely military community outside the capital , @entity127			1
the @entity4 raid , which was conducted without the knowledge of @entity15 , enraged the @entity15 public and deploy embarrassed its military			1
@entity1 has said he remains convinced that someone with authority in @entity15 knew @entity5 was hiding at the compound			1
that claim has been denied by @entity15 officials			0
@entity4 - @entity15 relations remain tense , in part because of @entity4 drone strikes inside the country			1
@entity15 has in essence halted much of its cooperation with the @entity4 while its parliament reassess future terms of engagement with @entity146 following a @entity4 airstrike in november that killed 24 @entity15 soldiers along the border with @entity150 .			2

@entity1 : there is no doubt the operation to get @entity5 made the @entity4 safer
@entity1 was the @entity71 director during the may 2 , 2011 , raid in @entity14 , @entity15
he recalled moments during the raid that were " nerve - wracking "
