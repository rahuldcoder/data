-- @entity2 smartphone market share trails @entity4 market share by a scant 9 percentage points in a recent study from analysis giant @entity7			1
according to statistics on overall @entity10 market share , @entity2 is the single fastest - growing mobile platform			1
by contrast , @entity12 's @entity11 shows an ever - so - slight decline			1
other operating systems , including @entity16 and @entity17 , show sharp declines over the past quarter			2
still , @entity16 is the top mobile os by the numbers , with around 30 percent of the total market share			1
last month , @entity7 's stats showed that @entity2 was the preferred platform of new smartphone buyers , suggesting that big - budget marketing campaigns for devices such as the @entity26 lineup and @entity28 's @entity27 were paying off			2
in fact , @entity29 outsold iphones for the first time ever in the first half of 2010			0
nevertheless , these stats still show @entity11 devices as the leading smartphones in the @entity2 - versus - @entity4 battle			1
today , @entity2 has 19 percent of the mobile os market , while @entity12 's @entity11 smartphones have 28 percent			1
age also plays a role in which device a given smartphone user is likely to choose			0
members of the under - 35 crowd were more likely to be seen with an @entity2 than were older folks			0
and @entity16 held sway with users over 45			0
@entity12 dominated when it came to smartphone users ages 44 and under			0
based on these trends , we fully expect @entity16 devices to sink below iphones in popularity within the next quarter			0
and we 're sure it wo n't be too long before @entity2 and @entity11 are neck - and - neck in competing for smartphone dominance			2
do you think the consumer actions behind these trends are based more on device performance and facts or more on personal bias and marketing ? we 'd love to get your opinions in the comments			0
