@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 can be forgiven for feeling a little emotional ahead of this weekend 's @entity6 @entity5			1
after notching up 11 wins in eight years for @entity8 , a longevity that makes him the famous @entity1 @entity13 team 's second - longest - serving driver , his last race for the @entity8 will be at the track he calls home			1
few nations can deliver the passion for motorsport and race - day color that @entity6 offers , or match the country for its production - line output of star drivers such as @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29			1
but for the latest talent from those shores , there is good reason to be anxious throughout the festivities that will take place at the @entity38 - based @entity37 circuit			2
" we 've always had great drivers in @entity6 and many champions , i think racing is in our blood , and it 's very special to be part of @entity6 and to carry on fighting , " @entity3 told @entity2 's @entity39			1
" but @entity6 is getting less and less drivers , you know , so now i am the only @entity6 @entity13 driver			1
" it 's difficult to see other drivers that can replace me for the future			2
when i was racing in little categories -- @entity55 , @entity13 3000 here in @entity57 -- in every category there was one @entity6 fighting for the championship , for victories			1
" and now you do n't see it anymore			0
it is definitely a worry and is something that ... i think our organization , our federation , should do something to improve our school in @entity6			2
" the 32 - year - old , who has agreed a deal with @entity72 for the next three seasons after being replaced by @entity74 at @entity8 , believes @entity6 needs to invest more on young talent and build on the strengths of its go - kart program			1
" something 's changed , especially in the school categories			0
we do n't have another category after go - karts			0
any way i can help ... i would do everything i can because @entity6 is a very special country for motor racing , " @entity3 added			1
despite his fears for the future , @entity3 is passionate about the role @entity37 has played in his career			2
" well , i love that track			0
i mean , i started there			0
on the other side of the wall there 's the go - kart track , and this side of the wall is the normal racing track for the cars			2
i started when i was eight in go - karts , so i spent my life there and it 's a fantastic track , " he said			0
these fond memories persist despite @entity37 also being the location where @entity3 was narrowly beaten by @entity106 's @entity105 to the drivers ' world title in 2008 , finishing just one point behind the @entity110 despite his victory			1
" even if i lost the championship there in the last corner , i won the race			0
i started in pole position , i did the quickest lap of the race , so everything was perfect , " he said			0
" for sure i lost the championship ... but i also had a great race in @entity38 and i had also a great championship as well			0
" @entity8 has not always been the easiest team to be a number two driver -- as @entity28 found out when he had to take a back seat to the ambitions of @entity127 from 2000 - 05			1
@entity3 , likewise , has had second billing at @entity0 since the 2010 arrival of double world champion @entity130			2
team orders have often been enforced to the detriment of @entity3 's own goals , but he says there are no regrets over his time driving behind the " @entity138 " badge			1
" for sure you always have days where you expect better results and better things , but ... i had a lot of great times with @entity8 and very good years , " said @entity3 , who suffered a horrific accident in @entity143 in 2009 that kept him out of the car until the following season due to serious head injuries			1
" good fights , you know , victories and some difficult days , even one big accident that i had , which was also part of my history and my life			0
but i think i would not change anything in my life			0
i am very happy and i have zero frustrations in my life , " he added			0
no frustrations , maybe , but he still has an unfulfilled ambition of becoming world champion which , despite the domination of @entity161 and the @entity162 , burns on inside his heart			0
getting back in the winning habit in front of a home crowd would be a big step in the right direction			2
" when i do n't believe anymore , i would stop racing , " he said			0
" i mean , i really believe in myself , i know what i can do and i am really looking forward to having my championship , my title , and working on that			0
" @entity3 's bid for a " home victory " got off to a steady but unspectacular start friday , claiming seventh fastest time in afternoon practice in his @entity8 , but quicker than teammate @entity130 , who was 11th best			1
@entity179 set the fastest time in both sessions for @entity181 , with four - time champion @entity161 second best in the afternoon runs as he bids for his ninth straight win and 13th of the season .			1

@entity3 is lining up for his final race for @entity8 this weekend at his home circuit
the @entity6 is moving to the @entity72 team after being replaced by @entity74
@entity3 is worried that @entity6 's production of racing stars appears to be *waning*
