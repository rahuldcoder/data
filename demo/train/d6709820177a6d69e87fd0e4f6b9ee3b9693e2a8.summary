@entity17 wanted to know more			1
" i would just @entity45 and hope for the best			0
i 'd just keep going and going until i saw enough evidence that to me said , just avoid it			0
just do n't put that in your body , " she says			0
eight years later , how she chooses what to buy is a far cry from how she was raised , @entity17 says			1
when sister - in - law @entity55 had to have her uterus removed because a complication with her last pregnancy led to uncontrolled bleeding , @entity17 offered to carry her next child			1

" she is organic , and she does know everything that 's going into her body			2
she reads labels , " says @entity55			0
" you never know when you 're hiring some surrogate to do it , what they 're doing to their bodies			0
" the @entity74 says common chemicals like @entity76 , phthalates and pesticides are safe , but research shows they pass from mother to child , and may be neurotoxins in the womb			2

" we 've come to understand that if you take some reasonable steps you can dramatically reduce your exposure to a lot of different chemicals , " says @entity110			0
" if you 're going to wait for the government to take action , you could be in store for a lot of exposure			0
" with the joy of surrogacy comes the burden of responsibility for @entity17			1
if anything goes wrong with her pregnancy , she says she could n't help asking herself , " what did i do ? " still , even careful shoppers like @entity17 get caught off guard			1
she felt good about buying @entity76 - free sippy cups for her toddler until she came across an article explaining that manufacturers can replace the bpa in plastic with similar chemicals like @entity140 , and still label their product " bpa - free "			2
