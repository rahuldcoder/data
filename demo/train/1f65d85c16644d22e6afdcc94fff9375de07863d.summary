a group of lawmakers are close to working out the details of their proposal , @entity1 said			2
" i 'm actually very optimistic that when they return in early april we will see a bill ready to move through the process , " he told @entity14			2
" the most important thing is that we are seeing a strong compromise to resolve the problem , " he said			0
" i 've got my own legislation , i 'm prepared to step in , but i do n't think that 's going to be necessary			0
" in another interview that aired at the same time on @entity26 , the president made a similar point			2
" my sense is that they are close , " @entity1 told @entity26			1
" my expectation is we 'll see a bill on the floor of the @entity34 next month			1
" his comments to @entity14 and @entity26 -- in interviews that were conducted in @entity37 and aired in dubbed @entity7 -- were part of the president 's latest push to ignite congressional movement on immigration reform			1
if a bill is introduced next month , @entity1 told @entity14 he was " confident we can get it done certainly before the end of the summer			1
" last week a source familiar with the immigration reform proposal negotiations said a bipartisan group of eight senators had tentatively agreed to some of the stickiest issues , like a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and metrics for securing the border			0
but there was a key issue that had yet to be resolved : how to construct a guest worker program for the future			0
the senators were haggling over details like how much low - skilled guest workers would be paid , and how many workers would be allowed into the country each year , the source said			1
according to the source , the eight senators -- four @entity67 and four republicans , who released the framework for their plan in january -- were confident last week that they would be ready to unveil the highly anticipated immigration bill early in the week of april 8 , when @entity73 returns to work			2
on wednesday , @entity1 told @entity14 he did n't think the debate over guest workers would derail reform efforts			1
" i disagree that it 's threatening to doom the legislation			0
... i think there is commitment among this group of @entity67 and @entity83 senators to get this done , " he said			0
the interviews aired hours after the @entity86 announced that @entity1 would be traveling to @entity87 and @entity88 in may , a topic @entity1 also touched on			1
when the reporters from @entity14 and @entity26 both noted that many @entity93 governments do not feel like they 're a priority for the @entity1 administration , the president described his upcoming trip			1
" i 'm really looking forward to the opportunity to visit @entity87			0
i 'm going to be there in early may , " @entity1 told @entity14			2
" sometimes the relationship gets characterized as being just about borders or just about drug cartels			0
