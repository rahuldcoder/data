-- @entity1 squeezes her eyes shut and cries as she listens to the 911 call that led police to rescue her from the house where @entity1 held her hostage for more than a decade			1
in the recording , fellow captive @entity1 begs police to come quickly , before @entity9 gets home			1
" help me , i 'm @entity1 , " she says			1
" i 've been kidnapped and i 've been missing for 10 years			0
and i 'm here , i 'm free now			0
" that frantic call six months ago finally brought authorities to the @entity14 home where @entity15 , @entity1 and @entity1 had been @entity9 's prisoners			1
the moment when police rescued them , @entity1 recalled in an interview broadcast wednesday on the syndicated " @entity22 " talk show , was a " roller coaster of mixed emotion			1
" " i wanted to kiss the ground that i was walking on and thank @entity27 for letting me get out of that hellhole , " @entity1 told host dr. @entity25			1
but @entity1 wiped away tears as she listened to the 911 call @entity15 made after escaping on may 6			2
it makes her sad , she told @entity25 , because of what @entity15 left out when she called for help from a neighbor 's house			0
" she did n't mention us , " @entity1 said			1
' finally being heard ' @entity9 lured @entity1 into his vehicle from a @entity39 in @entity14 in 2002 , promising to give her a ride			1
she endured more than a decade of torture , rape , starvation and beatings , held captive inside his home			2
in august , @entity9 was sentenced to life in prison plus 1,000 years after he pleaded guilty to 937 counts , including murder and kidnapping			2
he committed suicide in his prison cell in september			0
@entity1 , @entity15 and @entity54 have since been trying to readjust to life as free women			2
@entity1 , whose disappearance generated the least public notice of the three , has been the most outspoken			2
" after 11 years , i am finally being heard , and it 's liberating , " she said in a powerful statement at @entity9 's sentencing , describing the abuse she endured			1
@entity1 was @entity9 's first victim , and her interview with " @entity22 , " which aired tuesday and wednesday , marks the most detailed remarks any of the women have made publicly so far about their experience			1
it provides a detailed glimpse into some of the horrors she suffered , her relationships with the other women , and the day when she got her first taste of freedom after 11 years in captivity			0
' we thought somebody was breaking in ' it started when she heard a pounding sound coming from downstairs , @entity1 told @entity25			2
@entity9 had gone out for the day , @entity1 recalled			1
he told them he was going to visit his mother , then buy them some food			0
police were outside , trying to get in after @entity15 's 911 call			2
but at the time , @entity1 says , she thought robbers were coming in and she asked @entity54 to turn down the radio			2
" so we 're hiding , because we 're scared			0
we did n't know that the cops were down there , " @entity1 said			1
" we thought somebody was breaking in , because it was a bad neighborhood			0
so we 're sitting there hiding behind a dresser			0
" @entity1 says she heard an officer shout , " @entity84 ! " but she still did n't feel safe -- until she saw a badge			1
" i just ran , " she recalled			0
" i jumped on her ( the officer ) and i never let go			0
" @entity1 returns to @entity14 house where she was held for 11 years ' i had to help him drill holes in a wall ' since their release , accounts have depicted @entity1 as someone who cared for the other victims during their captivity while also enduring great suffering herself			2
@entity9 , @entity1 told @entity25 , would tell her of his plans to abduct other women			1
" i begged him not to bring any more there to suffer the hell i went through , " @entity1 said			2
but it was n't long before @entity1 learned that she was n't the only captive			1
in 2003 , @entity9 abducted @entity15 and brought her to the house			2
the next year , he kidnapped @entity54			0
@entity1 said @entity9 made her get ready for @entity54 ' arrival			1
" he was telling me that i needed to help him prepare another room , " @entity1 told @entity25 , " and i did n't want to prepare that room			1
... i had to help him drill holes in a wall , to put the chains through , to hook us together			0
" the two quickly developed a close bond , @entity1 said			2
when @entity9 tried to abuse @entity54 , @entity1 said she often stepped in			1
" he went to hit her and i would stop him and take the hit , " she said			0
" i would jump in front of her			0
... i know how it feels to be hurt , and i did n't want her to go through that			2
" delivering @entity15 's baby asked by @entity25 how she feels about @entity15 , @entity1 said , " we 're ok			1
not the best of friends , but ok			0
" she described the day when @entity9 forced her to help deliver @entity15 's baby in a swimming pool			1
" he told me if the baby did n't come out alive , that he would blame me , " @entity1 said			1
" and at that moment when the baby did n't come out breathing , i knew if i did n't get her to breathe , that he would kill me right then and there			2
" @entity1 said she laid the baby on its back , started doing compressions on her chest and breathed into her mouth			1
" five minutes later , " @entity1 said , " she started screaming			2
" @entity1 said she became pregnant herself at least five times while in @entity9 's home			1
each time , she said , @entity9 beat her brutally until she miscarried			0
" every time got worse than the other , " she told @entity25			0
" by the third time that i got pregnant , it was kicking , jumping on my stomach , like if i was a bed			0
" @entity9 , @entity1 said , " did n't want a girl like me to have a kid			1
" " i was a girl that could n't be broken , a girl that could n't be underestimated , " @entity1 said			1
" when he figured out he could n't control me very much , he did n't want to give me a kid			0
" a troubled past during @entity1 's time in captivity , her case got less media attention than the disappearances of @entity15 and @entity54 , whose family members posted fliers and held candlelight vigils for them			1
that was something that @entity9 never let her forget , @entity1 said			1
" the first thing he 'll say to me , ' where 's your family ? why do n't you have any ? they must not really love you			0
' and it would hurt , ' cause i knew my family did n't care , and i knew they were n't there for me , " @entity1 said			1
@entity1 's grandmother , @entity179 , told @entity180 in may that the family had concluded that @entity1 had left of her own accord because she was angry that she had lost custody of her then - 2 - year - old son			1
that conclusion was supported by police and social workers , she told the newspaper			0
her mother , @entity189 , issued a statement to the " @entity22 " show			0
" @entity1 , my daughter , has been the victim of long - term and profound and unspeakable torture			0
her point of view has been altered by that monster and what he did to her , " the statement said			0
" what i have heard that she said about me breaks my heart			0
that is because what she now believes , while not true , increases her pain			0
i always have and always will			0
i pray that someday she will heal enough to know that again			0
