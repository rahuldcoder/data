-- he won his first major at @entity3 , played several rounds there with the @entity5 and racked up a record 50 consecutive masters appearances -- but that 's not what leaps to @entity11 's mind when he reflects on the @entity13 course			1
he points instead to the way in which the masters -- the only one of golf 's four major tournaments to take place at the same course every year -- has spread the gospel of golf across @entity11 's home nation			1
" i think the @entity15 is something that has brought golf to the @entity28 people in a way that no other course and no other golf course could do , " the 84 - year - old told @entity0			1
" they rally around @entity3 , and not just people in the southeastern states			2
they come from @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 -- everywhere -- and that brings a certain mystique to the surface			2
" " @entity41 once said to me : ' you know @entity43 , i 've won a few golf tournaments in my life but i 'd give them all up for one masters			2
' " unlike the @entity47 , who won the @entity49 in 1946 but twice finished runner - up at @entity3 ( where his lowest round of 64 was a tournament record for 46 years ) , @entity11 had no such problems			1
in 1958 , just three years after turning pro , he took possession of the green jacket -- the first of four masters triumphs , and of seven majors in total			0
forty - six years later , @entity11 -- then 74 -- received an unforgettable standing ovation as he approached the 18th green for the final competitive time after half a century of contesting the course			1
latest scores : masters leaderboard like @entity69 , who misses his first masters this week because of back surgery , it is the tournament in which @entity11 competed the most -- so what made it so special ? " well , of course , the golf course itself			1
and the club is such a great place			0
everything ! " opined one of the sport 's all - time greats			1
" the location , the geography of the club , the way the course rolled , the condition -- it was always in impeccable condition , the greens were always good , the fairways			0
" the entire golf course was something that was a pleasure to be on and i just thoroughly enjoyed it			0
" the scene of his victories in 1958 , 1960 , 1962 and 1964 , @entity3 was also where @entity11 played plenty of golf with @entity100 , the @entity28 president of 1953 - 1961			1
their first round came just hours after @entity11 had won his first masters in 1958			1
" i was on the course when ( then @entity3 chairman ) @entity104 , a very close friend of @entity100 's , came out and said the president had said he 'd like to play the next day if i had time and would join him , " @entity11 recalls			1
it was the first of many rounds that the duo would enjoy together , with @entity11 later describing the golf - obsessed @entity100 as like a " second father			1
" no mention of @entity100 and @entity3 can of course be made without recalling the loblolly pine that became one of the most famous trees in golf history			2
standing a little over 200 yards from the tee , to the left of the fairway , the tree was one that the sitting @entity28 president , an @entity3 member , wanted removed because of his tendency to hit it so often			1
at a governors meeting in 1956 , the world 's most powerful man proposed that the tree be cut down -- only for his friend @entity104 , acting in his capacity as chairman , to rule him out of order and adjourn the meeting			0
the pine was swiftly nicknamed the " @entity134 " and had stood proud and unbowed until suffering unsustainable damage during a major ice storm this february			0
while @entity3 officials described the tree 's loss as " difficult news to accept " and have begun deliberations as to how best replace it , @entity11 believes @entity100 , who died in 1969 aged 78 , would have had a different viewpoint			1
" i 'm sure it did not make him unhappy that it was gone , " he laughs			0
" but i think it was sort of a love - hate relationship			0
i think he got a kick out of complaining about the tree because it gave him a lot of trouble			0
" on the other hand , it was part of @entity3 and a very important part			2
" @entity11 himself actually hit the famous tree en route to winning one of his masters titles , but there may be no such trouble in future for one of his grandchildren			2
@entity168 , now 26 , turned pro three years ago and is fighting to return to his best form after losing his @entity171 card after a disappointing 2013			0
appropriately enough , he made his first @entity171 appearance at last month 's @entity173 -- tying 43rd but beating the likes of @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177 nonetheless			0
" he 's a young man and he 's certainly getting some experience on playing professional golf , " says his grandfather , who followed him around the course in a buggy			2
" he 's got a lot of challenges : a family he has to take care of , his game and winning			0
these are all major obstacles for him and things he must do to enjoy the game and his career as a professional golfer			0
" he has the opportunity , but it 's going to take a lot of hard work			0
" something that @entity11 , who ended a 59 - year professional career at the age of 77 , knows all about .			1

the masters has been biggest boost to golf in @entity28 , says @entity11
six decades on from first playing at @entity3 , 84 - year - old is still in thrall to its " mystique "
@entity11 is considered one of golf 's all - time greats , *alongside* @entity211 and @entity212
he won the @entity15 four times , level with @entity69 and two behind @entity211 ' all - time record
