@entity0 , @entity1 -- in 1988 , a relatively unknown rock and blues guitarist named @entity5 got some of his friends together to play music in @entity0 , @entity1			1
it was just an opportunity for local musicians to jam during the holidays , the one time of year they were all in town together			0
@entity5 ' good work has been noted by the street named after him			1
the artists also wanted to give back to the community , so they gave the money raised by their show to various charities			2
now celebrating its 20th anniversary , @entity22 has evolved into an epic annual event for the musicians , fans , and particularly @entity27			1
" we need @entity27 more now than ever , with the whole mortgage crisis that put us where we are now , and the fact that @entity27 is about building homes for people that ca n't afford homes as opposed to lending money to people who ca n't afford homes , " @entity5 told @entity2			1
@entity5 and his wife , @entity38 , decided to donate 100 percent of the @entity22 proceeds to @entity27 years ago because they could see exactly where the money was going			1
they go back each year and meet the families they helped build homes for			0
@entity46 @entity45 echoed @entity5 ' thoughts			2
" it 's a scary time			0
a lot of people are losing their homes so it 's good to be able to do something that helps with that specific problem , " she said			0
going into 2008 's shows , which were held december 12 and 13 , the @entity22 had raised more than $ 665,000 for @entity0 's @entity27			1
the money has gone into building 12 houses in @entity59 , a wooded community surrounded by mountains on a street the organization appropriately named @entity64			1
( in 2005 @entity27 also built a house in the @entity67 @entity66			1
) the thursday before the show , @entity5 presented the key to a new home to single mother @entity71 and her 8 - year - old daughter			2
" meeting the families and seeing the work that @entity27 's doing with our help -- you know its hard to see that and not get emotional , " @entity5 said			1
" @entity5 is a hero in our mind , " said @entity27 's @entity79			1
" in western @entity1 , the housing costs are really out of whack with what the local wages are , so there 's a big discrepancy there			1
there are more people that maybe would have been approved previously when the lending standards were n't so strict			0
" this year 's @entity22 lived up to the long - lasting and crowd - pleasing traditions of previous shows			2
the first night 's show ran more than nine hours , ending with an @entity97 set after 4 a.m. the second night 's show ended at 3:30 a.m. @entity99 included @entity100 and relentless 7 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity5 ' band @entity106			2
perhaps the most anticipated addition this year among both fans and artists was former @entity111 member @entity110 , who played acoustic mandolin , bass and keyboards throughout the weekend with just about everyone			0
@entity110 said he was happy to pitch in			0
" in the economic climate like this , people really just want to get out and enjoy themselves and forget about the day to day stuff that they have to deal with			0
so it works on many levels , " @entity110 said			0
" the fact that it is for a good cause is just a huge bonus			0
" @entity5 says the 20 - year evolution of the @entity22 reflects his career			1
" we 've grown up together			0
its a parallel of the progress that i have achieved , and the event reflects not only the philosophy i share with these people but the mission			0
" and as fans danced the night away while the artists played their hearts out , families ' dreams of owning their perfect home come true			0
" i would have never imagined or dreamed that it would turn into what its turned into , " @entity5 reflected with a huge smile .			2
