-- the @entity2 school superintendent who last week fired all the teachers and staff from a school whose students were performing poorly said wednesday she is willing to negotiate now that the union has agreed to support changes			1
" it is with great excitement that i read the press release from the @entity15 referencing their proposed comprehensive reform agenda , " said @entity10 superintendent @entity9 in a news release			1
" it so closely mirrors my requests for assurances that i am pleased to reassure the union their place in the planning process			0
i do so with the belief that everyone has come to understand the meaning of comprehensive school reform			0
" @entity9 added the school district will press ahead with its plan for improving @entity28			2
in a written statement , @entity30 president @entity29 said the union was pleased that @entity9 has agreed to go back to the table			1
" the dedicated teachers and staff want nothing more than to continue and improve upon the progress they have made , " @entity29 said			0
" real , sustainable change will only happen when all stakeholders work together			0
" @entity9 's statement came a day after the @entity42 recommended a number of changes , including increasing instructional time for students , enhancing their support and increasing teaching quality			1
last week , the school board approved @entity9 's plan to discharge 93 people -- classroom teachers , administrators and other personnel -- at the high school			1
the school is in a low - income area , and many of its students are @entity59 with @entity60 as their second language			0
the firings , which were to have become effective at the end of the school year , came after the district failed to reach an agreement with the teachers ' union on a plan for teachers to spend more time with students to improve test scores			1
a union spokesman said the firings were drastic and cited a 21 percent rise in reading scores and a 3 percent hike in math scores in the past two years			2
another official also pointed to progress at the school			0
but @entity2 's education commissioner @entity82 defended the mass firings , calling them " many years in coming			2
" @entity82 pointed out that the school 's graduation rate is 48 percent , and " only 7 percent of the students are proficient in mathematics			1
" " more than half of the ninth - graders are failing more than two classes , which is an indication that they are frustrated , and what we know about student achievement , when students are n't successful in their class , they 're much more likely to drop out of school , " @entity82 said			0
in remarks monday to the @entity103 @entity102 , president @entity100 appeared to express support for the firings			0
" if a school continues to fail its students year after year after year , if it does n't show signs of improvement , then there 's got to be a sense of accountability , " he said			2
" and that 's what happened in @entity2 last week at a chronically troubled school , when just 7 percent of 11th graders passed state math tests -- 7 percent			1
" the @entity30 said @entity100 's comments " do not reflect the reality on the ground and completely ignore the teachers ' significant commitment to working with others to transform this school			0
