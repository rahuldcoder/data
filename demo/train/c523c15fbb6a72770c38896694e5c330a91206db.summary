-- in the 1970s and ' 80s , when corporate @entity1 was plagued with inefficiency , a new class of financially motivated takeover investors emerged to prey on the fattest in the corporate herd and scare the rest into line			1
today , as pockets of corporate @entity1 are plagued with immorality , we need a new class of socially motivated takeover investor to prey on the sociopaths in the corporate herd , turn them around and perhaps scare ( or shame ) others into line			1
the upcoming sale by @entity19 of the @entity20 , the largest gun manufacturer in the @entity1 , is a perfect opportunity to usher in this new era of muscular , socially responsible capitalism : first , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and the like should establish a nonprofit @entity28 ( @entity28 ) called @entity30 ( @entity29 ) with a mission to reduce needless deaths through gun violence in the @entity1 and encourage the passage of sensible gun control regulations			1
they should appoint @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 to the fundraising committee and recruit a loud - mouthed , poison - penned , but good - hearted activist hedge fund titan as chief investment officer ( @entity42 ? @entity42 ? )			0
opinion : forgotten victims of gun violence to be credible , @entity29 will probably need to start with at least $ 250 million in cash and commitments ( no problem given the billionaire status of the sponsors ) with additional firepower raised as needed from well - heeled individuals , foundations and through a broad - based @entity55 solicitation to an outraged - by - @entity57 public			1
second , @entity29 should lobby all public pension funds that are part owners of the @entity20 ( by virtue of their investment in @entity19 ) to roll their investment into bff to reduce the need for outside funding , naming and shaming any unwilling public investors			0
@entity57 shooter 's guns third , @entity29 should pay " whatever it takes " to acquire control of the @entity20 in the upcoming auction by @entity19 ( which has a fiduciary obligation to sell to the highest bidder ) and then immediately implement a " moral turnaround " plan under which the @entity20 : ( i ) appoints a high - profile ceo with impeccable credentials as a hunter and / or marksman who is nevertheless in favor of gun - control			1
opinion : guns endanger more than they protect ( ii ) elects a new board of directors including representatives from the families of victims killed in @entity57 ( and / or other massacres perpetrated with @entity20 weapons ) , military veterans and trauma surgeons with real experience of human - on - human gunfire , and law enforcement and mental health professionals			0
( iii ) operates the business as if sensible gun laws were in place ( this may turn out to be a wise investment in future - proofing the company ) : discontinuing sales of the most egregious assault weapons and modifying others as necessary so they can not take huge - volume clips ; offering to buy back all @entity20 assault weapons in circulation ; micro-stamping weapons for easy tracking ; and providing price discounts for buyers willing to go through a background check and register in a database available to law enforcement			1
( iv ) voluntarily waives its rights to support the @entity118 and other lobbying groups			0
( v ) creates a fund to compensate those who , despite its best efforts , are killed or wounded by its weapons			0
( vi ) agrees that if the effort to provide moral leadership in the weapons industry does n't succeed within a year , @entity29 should consider corporate euthanasia , even though it entails a risk of allowing more retrograde manufacturers to fill the void in the market left by the then - deceased company			1
opinion : the case for gun rights is stronger than you think in the face of horrors like @entity57 , @entity29 would recognize that it 's time to take a stand by acknowledging the impossibility of reaching closure after such a monstrous act while an unreconstructed @entity20 continues to sell a huge volume of guns and ammunition rounds each year even if it is operating under new owners			2
like any @entity152 strategy , this is a long shot , but it must be tried			0
history suggests that only after the first company " turns " will an industry gradually return to the realm of the human ( think of big tobacco )			2
and without the tacit agreement , if not the outright support , of at least one important insider , policymakers seem utterly unable to pass tough regulations in the face of the predictable but withering assault by industry lackeys shrieking that any such regulation would be " impossible , impractical or too expensive			0
" in the face of a recalcitrant industry , we have to acknowledge that it is only the market for corporate control -- the real possibility that an outsider will take over one of the companies -- that puts limits on the behavior of board members and executives who , while perhaps decent enough in their family lives , display a limitless tolerance for the " banality of evil " at the office			2
opinion : not man enough ? buy a gun we must accept that the conventional , kid - gloves approach to socially responsible investing -- divesting shares in " bad " companies that nevertheless continue to exist -- is too weak an instrument to force change and its well - meaning practitioners too soft to enter the fray when emotionally and politically charged battles need to be fought			2
and regardless of the viability of socially motivated takeovers in general , the @entity20 looks like a great target			0
@entity19 is a motivated seller , the political macros look favorable , and it 's a bite - sized company compared with many of the larger sociopaths in the corporate herd			1
i 'm even cautiously optimistic that the current impasse over gun regulation is a bad - equilibrium that few consumers actually want , and that a reconstructed @entity20 , fighting for sensible change as a fifth column from within the industry , might well find that many people -- even a significant portion of the @entity118 's members -- would buy from a truly responsible ( and high quality ) gunmaker if given the chance			1
all in all , it 's a pretty exciting deal , so if @entity222 and @entity26 are up for it , count me in			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity225 .			0

the owner of @entity1 's largest gunmaker is putting firm up for sale
@entity225 says billionaires should lead effort to acquire the gun manufacturer
he says they should change corporate practices to discourage violence
@entity241 : one leading company could push gun industry in a more *ethical* direction
