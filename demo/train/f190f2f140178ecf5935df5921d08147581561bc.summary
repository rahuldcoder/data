-- @entity2 quiz : name every big - league baseball team			2
no fair looking it up online , or checking a newspaper sports page			2
( pause ) are you back ? if you could do it , congratulations -- you may belong in the @entity11			2
i 've followed baseball since i was a kid , and i could n't come up with all the teams when i tried just now			1
i do n't feel so bad about it , because i asked two baseball fanatics -- guys who really know the game -- if they could rattle off all the teams , and they had their doubts			1
" i probably could n't do it , " said @entity20 , formerly executive editor of both @entity21 and @entity22 , and editor of " @entity24 , " an anthology of original essays about the @entity27 by celebrated writers , to be published next month			0
" i 'm supposed to know this , but i 'd probably miss one or two			0
" @entity20 said that if you were to go up to people on the street and ask them to name all the @entity36 teams , " i 'd guess that only 5 % or 10 % could do it -- most likely closer to 5 %			1
" author @entity37 , who is at work on " @entity39 : the @entity40 , @entity41 , and the @entity42 , " agreed with @entity20 : " less than 10 % of people would be able to do it			2
i know that i 'd end up leaving some teams out			2
" the reason for this little exercise is that @entity36 has just announced that its playoffs will be expanded by two teams , so that 10 teams will now go into post-season play			1
there are currently 30 big - league teams : 16 in the @entity54 and 14 in the @entity55			1
it 's that 30 - team number that makes verbally zipping through a list of them so daunting			1
( when , after @entity37 and @entity20 had predicted that they 'd be unable to name all the teams i asked them to attempt it , @entity37 maxed out at 29 teams and @entity20 hit 26 before , 18 minutes into trying , he said he 'd toss in the towel			2
i made it to 29 , but i allowed myself longer than 18 minutes			0
if so , @entity37 , @entity20 and i salute you			0
) from the first years of the 20th century straight through to the early 1960s , baseball had perfect symmetry : eight teams in the @entity54 , eight teams in the @entity72			1
any kid and most adults could quickly list them			0
it was easy to determine if the town where you lived was big - league : if there was one of those 16 teams in town , then it was			1
if not , then it was n't			0
there was only one playoff series : the @entity88			2
under baseball 's new system , the equivalent of the entire old @entity54 and 25 % of the old @entity55 would make it to the playoffs			1
all of this is very good for the baseball business and the television sports business			1
but just as when any professional sports league expands there are worries about a dilution of the talent pool , so , too , when the playoffs keep expanding , there is a danger of the dilution of memories			1
when you try to spread big moments out too thin , they do n't seem quite as big anymore			0
and , as @entity37 pointed out , for all the benefits and basic fairness that came with free agency , " when players switch teams so much , it 's tough for the fans to get a chance to root for a solid group of players for six or eight straight years			1
" the memories keep heading out of town			2
how visceral and enduring is the meaning of all this ? i still treasure as one of the most dizzyingly wondrous days of my life a single summer afternoon in 1983 when i got to spend time talking with @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134			0
the occasion was the 50th anniversary of the @entity137 ; a special old - timers ' game had been arranged			0
i was working for @entity140 's " @entity139 " in those @entity141 years , and i was assigned to do the story			0
it was like a parade of @entity146 baseball cards come to life -- the good cards , the prized ones , the cards you hoped against hope would be included in the wax - paper pack you bought at the drugstore , along with that brittle , pink , always slightly stale slab of gum			1
( my favorite moment of the afternoon ? easy -- @entity128 telling me he had gone to a car wash , and , surprised at how inexpensive it was , asking the attendant if the price was n't usually higher : " and the fellow said , ' yes , sir , but we give a discount to senior citizens			0
' " second favorite moment ? the organist at @entity169 's old @entity168 playing " when i 'm 64 " as i was talking on the field with @entity129 , and @entity129 saying : " do they have one called ' when i 'm 65 ' ? " he was about to have a birthday			0
) @entity36 clearly did the right thing fiscally by growing past the original eight - team leagues and establishing outposts in far - flung parts of the country			1
per - team home attendance is much higher now than it was in , say , the early 1950s			0
and adding two more teams to the playoffs will make the cash registers ring			1
yet there was something kind of swell about the years when , of course , you could rapidly name every team -- when you knew them as well as you knew the names of the streets in your own neighborhood			0
but , as @entity20 told me , the act of remembering has itself become largely unnecessary : " we do n't have to remember things , so we do n't			0
the answer to any question is : ' give me five seconds on the @entity198			0
' " so if you could n't name those 30 teams , it may not matter			1
sincere good luck to baseball with its expanded playoffs			1
and @entity205 probably does n't have to worry that some post-season hero will someday supplant him as mr. october			0
at this rate , the new guy will be mr. november			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity213 .			2

@entity36 is expanding the number of playoff teams to 10
@entity213 recalls when baseball had just 16 teams , and fans could easily name them
in an era of 30 teams , even baseball experts stumble at the *challenge* , he says
@entity213 : expanding playoffs may be good for *revenue* but risks diluting memories
