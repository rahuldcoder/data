@entity0 -- president @entity2 holds a distinction among those who have sought the nation 's top job : he 's the only major candidate to win the @entity7 despite losing the vote in the state where he was born and the state where he lived			1
it happened in 1844 , and now 168 years later , @entity13 nominee @entity12 may need to duplicate @entity15 's feat if he wants to defeat president @entity16 in tuesday 's election			0
according to polls , @entity12 faces the prospect of losing both the state of his birth , @entity22 , and the state where he lives and served as governor , @entity25			1
@entity26 @entity16 holds a double digit lead in @entity25 , but the race is closer in @entity22 , with the polls tightening , though the president remains in front			2
under the @entity34 system , each state is worth a certain number of electoral votes based on population			0
there are a total of 538 electoral votes available , meaning 270 are required to win			0
@entity12 has many plausible paths to victory on tuesday without winning @entity22 or @entity25			1
yet the prospect that he might lose either or both raises the question of how many other presidential candidates in @entity47 history also were unable to win their birth or home states ? winners who overcame the loss of a state with strong personal ties included @entity55 , @entity56 and both @entity57 and his son , @entity58			1
new national poll shows @entity16 , @entity12 virtually tied @entity55 won his home state of @entity61 , but lost his birth state of @entity63 in both of his presidential runs in 1860 and 1864			1
in 1968 , @entity56 won his birth state of @entity66 , where he also ran unsuccessfully as governor , but lost his home state of @entity69 , where he had been working as a lawyer for a few years			1
both of the @entity72 won the state where they lived -- @entity74 -- in their three successful presidential campaigns , but lost their birth states -- @entity25 for the father and @entity78 for the son			1
many more candidates who lost either their birth or home states also lost the election			1
@entity84 would have defeated @entity58 in 2000 if the @entity86 vice president carried his home state of @entity88			0
@entity86 president @entity89 won a larger share of the popular vote than @entity92 in 1888 , but he lost his home state of @entity69 and the electoral vote to his @entity13 foe			0
here 's a look at some of the presidential candidates who lost their home or birth states : two candidates , two journeys , one race of lost dreams 1844 -- democrat @entity2 lost both his birth state of @entity106 and home state of @entity88 , but still managed to defeat @entity108			1
1860 -- @entity13 @entity55 lost his birth state of @entity63 , but won his home state of @entity61 in defeating @entity111			2
the same dynamic occurred four years later when @entity55 defeated @entity113			0
1888 -- incumbent @entity86 president @entity89 won his birth state of @entity116 , but lost his home state of @entity69 in falling to @entity92			2
in this race , @entity118 won a slightly larger share of the popular vote than @entity92 , but lost in the @entity34			0
1916 -- incumbent @entity86 president @entity122 won his birth state of @entity124 , but lost his home state of @entity116 in defeating @entity126			2
1932 -- @entity13 president @entity127 lost his birth state of @entity129 in falling to @entity131 @entity130			0
as the incumbent and a former cabinet secretary , @entity127 had been living in @entity0 for years before the election , and he also lost the @entity136 vote			0
1944 -- @entity13 @entity137 lost both his birth state of @entity22 and his home state of @entity69 , where he was governor , in falling to incumbent president @entity130			1
1952 -- democrat @entity140 lost his birth state of @entity66 and his home state of @entity61 , where he was governor , in falling to gen. @entity143			2
the same thing happened four years later , when the incumbent president @entity143 also won @entity66 and @entity61 in defeating @entity140			0
1968 -- former @entity13 vice president @entity56 won his birth state of @entity66 , but lost his home state of @entity69 in defeating @entity131 @entity147 , who lost his birth state of @entity149 , but won his home state of @entity151 , which he had represented in the @entity152			2
1972 - @entity86 sen. @entity153 lost @entity149 , both his birth and home state , in getting swamped by incumbent president @entity56			0
1992 - incumbent president @entity57 lost his birth state of @entity25 , but won his home state of @entity74 in falling to @entity86 gov. @entity158			1
2000 -- @entity74 gov. @entity58 won his home state , but lost his birth state of @entity78 in defeating @entity86 vice president @entity84 , who won his birthplace of @entity0 , but lost his home state of @entity88 , which he had represented in the @entity152			0
2004 -- incumbent president @entity58 again won his home state of @entity74 , but lost his birth state of @entity78 in defeating @entity131 @entity163 , who lost his birth state of @entity165 , but won his home state of @entity25 , which he represented in the @entity152			1
@entity1 's @entity167 contributed to this report .			0

@entity12 might not win @entity22 , where he was born
he is well behind in @entity25 , where he served as governor
@entity12 has many plausible paths to victory without those states
@entity2 in 1844 lost his birth and home states but won the presidency
