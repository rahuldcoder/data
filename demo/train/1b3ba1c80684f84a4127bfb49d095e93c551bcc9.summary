the conflict in the @entity177 has intensified since november 23 , when @entity7 forces launched an artillery barrage @entity90			0
@entity22 accused the @entity5 of provoking the attack , which also injured 18 people , because shells from a @entity5 military drill landed in the @entity110 's waters			0
