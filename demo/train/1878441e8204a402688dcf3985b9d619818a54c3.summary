-- one damp , chilly evening in october , @entity1 called the police			2
she had a rather unusual problem : a lion in her back yard			2
she was calling from @entity6 , named after her family and familiar to law enforcement authorities in the small town of @entity10 , @entity11			1
they had had responded to complaints there before			2
@entity1 's neighbor , @entity15 , owned a bunch of wild animals			1
when sgt. @entity18 arrived on the scene , he saw a black bear and two @entity22 lions			2
he immediately shut down @entity6 and called for help			2
what happened next on that evening reads more like the stuff of an action - packed adventure novel than police reports			1
the @entity29 has released many of those reports that reveal how law enforcement officials were thrust into a desperate hunt for potential killers on the loose			1
on october 18 , as highway signs cautioned drivers to remain in cars and local schools were making a decision to close the next morning , deputies traversed @entity15 's property and beyond and came face to face with animals that most people see from the other side of a cage or in the safety of a guided safari			1
deputy @entity48 had been on @entity15 's property before , responding to previous complaints about him , including animal abuse			1
@entity15 , 62 , had been released from a federal prison september 30 after pleading guilty earlier this year to possessing illegal firearms , including five fully automatic firearms			1
a civil case seeking forfeiture of firearms was pending			2
@entity48 picked up his @entity58 rife with .223 - caliber ammo and got in the back of the pickup			2
the deputies began going up @entity15 's driveway not knowing what they would find			1
it was already after 6 p.m. and they knew they only had one hour of daylight left			2
there were cages on the left and the right of the driveway			1
tigers , lions , cheetahs and bears roamed about			0
they were ordered to find @entity15 and " neutralize " any animal that posed a threat to people			1
with no tranquilizers on hand , their only choice was to shoot			0
@entity15 's house was empty , save two monkeys and a small dog , @entity18 said in his report			1
on his way out , @entity18 saw a body near an embankment			0
he was on his back			0
a handgun lay near him			0
and a pair of blue bolt cutters			0
he had used it to free all his animals from their pens before he shot himself			1
a large white tiger was sitting 5 feet away			0
it appeared the cat had fed on @entity15 's flesh , @entity18 said			1
it was impossible for the deputies to approach the body because of the tiger			1
the deputies called for more help and got out on foot			1
right behind @entity15 's large barn , at the top of hill near the house , they saw several large cages where the larger lions had been kept			1
the deputies secured the heavy wooden doors but as they got closer , they realized the cages had been cut open			1
a lion came out just 3 feet away			0
@entity48 said he was forced to shoot it dead			0
another deputy encountered a lion hissing at him and baring its lethal teeth			0
behind the lions were pens that held bears and wolves but , instead , a tiger and bear came out			0
it , too , had to be put down			0
the deputies were able to save a black panther and a spotted leopard			1
at 11:30 , the deputies gave up the search for the night			1
@entity48 said sheriff @entity133 told him his replacement would arrive at 6:30 in the morning			2
but @entity48 was not out of danger yet			0
he and deputy @entity136 were walking down to the back of @entity15 's property when they encountered a tiger hiding in the brush			1
they radioed it in and were informed that a @entity145 zookeeper was on her way to tranquilize the cat			0
it took 15 minutes for her to get there			0
it was going to take another 10 minutes for the tranquilizer to take effect			0
@entity48 and other deputies stood by with assault weapons			2
the tiger jolted when the dart hit , but it did not get up			0
but after a few minutes , it charged directly at the zookeeper			0
the tiger backed off and laid down			0
they gave it another 15 minutes for the tranquilizer to take effect			0
the zookeeper then felt it was safe to approach			0
but when they were less than 10 feet away , the tiger thrashed again			0
this time , it was shot dead			0
in all , deputies shot 49 of @entity15 's menagerie			1
some , like the bengal tigers , were endangered species			0
@entity15 's wife , @entity176 , chose a burial site , according to the police reports			1
the animals were placed in a single grave			2
@entity181 , who worked as a caretaker for @entity15 's animals , said that he had last seen @entity15 the day before he died , according to the police reports			1
@entity15 told him then that he had received a letter about @entity176 cheating on him			1
he told @entity181 : " i have a plan to find out and you will know when it happens			0
" no one may ever know what @entity15 's plans included -- his death is still under investigation and not all records have been released			1
the @entity196 said that under the circumstances , it did not fault the deputies for using deadly force			2
but a public debate was sparked over exotic animals and the laws that govern ownership			2
the bizarre events that day were seen around the world			0
and @entity10 will forever go down as the small @entity11 city with the really big animals .			1

owner @entity15 cut their cages and then killed himself
