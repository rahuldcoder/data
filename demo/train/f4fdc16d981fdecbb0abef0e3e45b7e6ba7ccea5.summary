-- a herd of hulking @entity3 bison huddles to keep warm during a prairie blizzard in @entity5			1
it 's an image that 's as vintage @entity7 as a @entity9 painting			1
the bison , often referred to as buffalo , teetered on the brink of extinction in the 19th century			1
but the bison 's destiny changed in 1883 when a young @entity16 first came to @entity17 's @entity5 for the sole purpose of hunting one			1
though @entity16 eventually got one for his trophy case , the lessons from that trip became his inspiration to ignite a conservationist movement that would help save the bison and pave the way for the national park system to evolve into an important @entity3 institution			1
8 amazing outdoor music venues today , @entity5 serves as a monument to a president who had the foresight to preserve and protect this country 's pristine wilderness			1
it 's also a testament to his ability to make such places accessible to all			1
@entity5 stats : the park was established in 1947 as @entity42 , but it was not officially designated as a national park until 1978			1
its two busiest years were 1972 , when it was about 1,100 guests short of 1 million for the year , and 1976 during the @entity48 , when it again flirted with 1 million visitors			0
the park has averaged slightly less than 600,000 visitors per year since 2008			1
the location : @entity16 consists of more than 70,000 acres in the @entity5 , which are not to be confused with the @entity55 in @entity56			1
the difference , according to park ranger @entity57 , is @entity17 's @entity5 are older , look different and have heavier vegetation			1
there are a number of ways to access the park , which is divided in three parts : @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67			1
@entity68 is the entrance to the @entity66 and is about a two - hour drive from the state capital , @entity72			0
the @entity74 entrance is about 14 miles south of @entity75 and is about three hours from @entity72			0
the two badlands are not contiguous , she says			2
throwback lodging : 5 historic stays the @entity67 is 35 miles north of @entity68 , but the only road access is on gravel roads			0
the park service recommends speaking with a ranger and getting a map before driving out to @entity67			2
if you are feeling more adventurous , you can access the ranch from the east by fording the @entity88			0
if you go : entrance fees are $ 10 for private noncommercial vehicles			0
individual passes ( hikers , cyclists and people on horseback ) are $ 5			0
the park offers a variety of events , places to visit and outdoor activities			2
the park is open every day except @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103			2
parts of the @entity105 and @entity106 close during winter			0
there are three visitor centers : @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity109			0
@entity110 and @entity109 are open seven days a week			0
however , the @entity74 visitor center is only open on weekends from september 2 to may 31			0
meet our ranger : @entity57 , 55 , was born in @entity115 , @entity116 , and says she knew in high school that she wanted to be a naturalist			0
in 1973 , she passed through @entity16 on one of many vacations she took with her parents			1
but her mother did n't share @entity57 's immediate interest in the park and they quickly moved on			1
" i was enthralled with the landscape in this park , " she says			2
" but i thought , ' that 's ok , i 'll come back here someday			2
' " she returned in 1979 as a volunteer for a student conservation association			0
she then worked as a seasonal park employee for two years and later used the park as a research laboratory for a master 's degree in biology at the @entity138			1
@entity57 became a full - time @entity140 employee in 1985 and returned to her " home park " in 2003 as superintendent			2
" the @entity88 , the prairie and the wildlife make it exceptional , " she says			2
" it also has the history of @entity16 , who was a great conservation president			1
" @entity57 has also worked at @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity55 , @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151			0
for a day trip , do n't miss : hiking the @entity153 in the @entity65			0
the park website lists the 4 - mile trail as moderate to strenuous			2
less experienced hikers can take the @entity157 , a 1.5 - mile shortened version			0
be sure to go in the early morning or late evening to maximize the chance to see wildlife , says @entity57			1
favorite less - traveled spot : the @entity67			0
@entity57 says the 218 acres are the most historically significant part of the park because it 's where @entity16 built his second ranch			1
@entity16 's first ranch was centered around the @entity168 , which has been moved from its original site and is now a museum			1
he made a second trek to @entity17 's @entity172 in 1884 after his wife and mother died on @entity175			1
with one cattle ranch already established in @entity17 , he chose a trek of land next to the @entity88 for the @entity67			1
" it 's a beautiful unspoiled place along the @entity88 that is much like it was when @entity16 first found it in 1884 , " she says			1
" and we 're trying very hard to keep it that way			0
" favorite spot to view wildlife : prairie dog town in the @entity66			1
in addition to prairie dogs , the park is home to a several species of deer , a variety of birds , coyotes , bobcats , beavers , badgers , rattlesnakes , elk , wild horses and bison			1
" prairie dogs provide food and shelter for so many animals that they are a great place to see other wildlife , " says @entity57			1
@entity57 says prairie dog holes are used by snakes , amphibians , burrowing owls and insect			0
the holes also cause vegetation changes , which provide grazing for bison			2
most magical moment in the park : in the summer of 1979 , when @entity57 spent her first year as a volunteer working in the visitor center conducting programs and sharing park history with guests			2
" i did not intend to make it a career , " she says			0
" but after spending the summer working at a national park , i had no other aspirations			2
and it was this park that did it for me			2
" funniest moment at the park : seeing a bison calf become confused about his mother 's identity			1
" i once watched a bison calf run across the prairie to mom -- fast as he could go , " she says			2
" when he got about 15 feet , he stopped , turned 90 degrees and ran to another one			0
that was one of the most amazing things i have seen			0
it was both interesting and funny			0
" a ranger 's request : the park is home to a variety of wildlife			1
understand that the bison are the most dangerous animals in the park , even though they look docile and calm			1
" they can run faster than a horse and turn on a dime , " she says			0
" generally , if an animal reacts to your presence , you are too close			0
they ( bison ) do charge humans			2
" another park she 'd like to visit : @entity272 in @entity273 , @entity274			0
located in the high desert of @entity274 , it is known for @entity278 cave art and as one of @entity281 's most continuously occupied geographic areas			0
@entity57 says her goal is to visit every national park and estimates she 's been to more than half of them			1
" i like large , wide - open landscapes , and it sounds like a fascinating place , " she says			0
" i like to go anywhere i have n't been before			0
