-- three decades ago @entity2 leaders unleashed a series of economic reforms that helped lift millions of people out of poverty and transform the @entity8 country into an industrial powerhouse with a mighty foreign reserve arsenal			1
the transition , however , was far from smooth			0
" particularly the first 10 years , it was really tough and hard , " explains @entity12 , @entity13 's special representative on @entity14			1
" so many businesses , factories , go ( into ) bankruptcy , millions of workers were being redundant or unemployed			0
" before becoming today 's economic behemoth , @entity13 was mainly an agricultural economy that boasted huge reserves of natural resources -- quite similar to many parts of @entity25			1
so are there any lessons that @entity25 countries can learn from @entity13 as they bid to boost their economies and achieve their development goals ? according to @entity12 , long - term economic success does n't come without short - term cost , and that is the message he is keen to get across to @entity25 leaders			1
" when we introduce our experience to @entity25 countries , on one side we need to say what you should do and need to do , and probably on the other side we should emphasize what you could expect			2
" @entity0 's @entity43 spoke to @entity12 about trade , investment and what lessons can @entity25 learn from @entity13 's rise to a superpower			1
an edited version of the interview follows			0
@entity0 : what can @entity13 teach @entity25 ? @entity52 : i can tell you a lot of things about what happened in @entity13 , what we have learned and what we experienced			1
personally i think that probably for the last few years when we try to impress people that we are successful with this open reform policy , we emphasize too much on what we have achieved			0
@entity66 's goal in @entity25 : @entity13 this is good because you need to prove you are successful but i think a little bit thing that 's being ignored is how much we 've paid for that			1
and if you are ignoring the price you pay for this kind of success , and particularly for @entity25 countries , if they understood that ' you @entity2 have some tricks , teach me the trick and then i will be as rich as you are ' and then we , particularly myself , look back and say " geez , these 30 years how did we experience that ? " particularly the first 10 years it was really tough and hard ; so many businesses , factories , go ( into ) bankruptcy , millions of workers were being redundant or unemployed			2
so probably when we introduce our experience to @entity25 countries , on one side we need to say what you should do and need to do , and probably on the other side we should emphasize what you could expect			2
@entity0 : do you think @entity25 leaders are ready , willing and able to make those sacrifices ? @entity52 : i will not answer on their behalf ; i would rather let them to answer that			1
but what we can contribute is to share what we have experienced			0
this could possibly happen anywhere if you want to have a reform			0
i think @entity25 countries , if they want to reform the structure of the economy , want to come forward and to become developed , this kind of challenge probably will come to them sooner or later			2
read this : can @entity13 transform @entity25 ? @entity0 : @entity13 in many ways is part of this reform in @entity25 , a relationship that is becoming more criticized			1
@entity117 's @entity116 governor wrote , for example , recently that @entity13 's relationship with @entity25 whiffs of colonialism			1
@entity52 : i fully understand him			2
i think he has the reason to be anxious , sometimes be angry			0
but i say that do n't jump to the conclusion so easily			0
colonialism is a heavy word ; when i think about colonialism i think about the six cents a barrel of oil being exported from this continent , leaving this continent with only poverty			0
but now what 's happening is changing this whole continent			0
because with the commodity trade with the world , it can generate its own development and foundation for infrastructure			0
this is the change , it 's happening			0
read this : @entity66 ' plays catch up ' in @entity25 but i really admire the governor for his courage to say in his article that " we need to compete with @entity13			1
" this is something i see as a very bright point in his article because i think eventually @entity25 people should be confident enough to stand up , to compete with any country of the world			2
without that kind of competition @entity25 can never develop itself and i always say that there is no loser in this competition ; everyone benefits from this kind of competition because this competition means development			1
i think the same thing will happen in @entity25			2
i 'm glad to see that ; our opportunity is to help them to compete with us , to help them win this competition			0
that 's the future ; it 's called a win - win situation			0
@entity0 : so what does @entity13 want from @entity25 ? @entity52 : we want a more prosperous world ; without that @entity13 can not develop itself			1
what the more prosperous world means is to lift this continent out of poverty			0
repeat what happened in @entity13 ; [ a ] repeat [ of ] what happened in @entity13 benefits @entity25 , and @entity13 itself will also benefit from that .			1

@entity25 will have to face short - term pain for long - term economic gain , he says
