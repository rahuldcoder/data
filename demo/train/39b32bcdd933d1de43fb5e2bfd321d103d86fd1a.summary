@entity0 -- for at least 10 minutes , it looked as if it could have been a fairytale night for the home side			1
within only the first few minutes , @entity0 's league winner @entity5 found itself in the jarringly unfamiliar position of being a goal to the good against star - studded @entity12 football champion @entity10			1
natural order reasserted itself shortly after , however , with @entity10 winger @entity15 scoring a well - taken goal as the crowd erupted			0
it was the first of six for the @entity20 side , including a hat - trick for star striker @entity22			2
as the wisdom of arduous preseason tours is being questioned in some quarters , especially as exhausted players return from the @entity27 , @entity10 was in bullish form here in @entity0 , and its growing popularity in evidence			2
indeed , wading through the crowds before kickoff , it was almost impossible to tell which team held home advantage in tuesday 's match , with @entity10 replica shirts -- mostly sporting the number 10 and @entity22 's name splayed across the back -- easily outnumbering any other sartorial choices			0
" this is the first time i 've seen them live , " says @entity43 , a finance professional who wears his navy - blue psg jersey over his white business shirt			0
" i 've been a fan for around two years , ever since they started buying up international stars			0
" regular trips the @entity52 preseason tour has become an annual ritual for many of @entity56 's top teams , although this year many @entity58 high - flyers , having won over @entity52 fans through years of visits , are instead turning their attention to that other great untapped market , the @entity63			1
the popularity of @entity58 teams in @entity0 , as in so many other @entity52 markets , far outstrips that of their @entity69 neighbors , even @entity72 winner @entity70 and fellow @entity74 giant @entity73 , as well as @entity77 titleholder @entity75			1
" it 's exciting to see these matches live ( in the stadium ) , " says 16 - year - old @entity78 , who is wearing a @entity10 replica shirt with @entity81 's name on the back , a throwback to when the @entity58 superstar played half a season in the @entity12 capital			1
" i 'd also come and watch if it was @entity91 or @entity92 , though			0
" it is through tours like @entity10 's mini-excursion into @entity0 , and onto @entity96 , that the marketing departments of these clubs hope to redress this balance			1
playing catch - up " we are quite lagging behind the @entity105 clubs and you need to catch this distance so i think it 's important to be here , even though it 's a long ( way to ) travel , " @entity10 's executive vice-president of business operations @entity101 tells @entity1			0
it 's not just the clubs that are targeting @entity52 fans as the financial future			2
the @entity12 league moved this season 's traditional opener , the @entity117 , in @entity118 , echoing the @entity121 @entity120 's decision to hold its version , the @entity123 , abroad in recent years			1
it is the the first time the @entity12 curtain - raiser has gone to @entity52			1
previously , the trophy winners had met in @entity128 ( 2009 ) , the @entity63 ( 2012 ) and @entity126 ( 2010/11/13 )			0
these games , featuring the league and domestic cup winners , are a step up from preseason friendlies like @entity10 's match against @entity5			2
saturday 's @entity135 clash with cup - winning @entity136 presents an opportunity for @entity10 to cement the allegiance of soccer fans in the @entity96 capital			0
despite the travel time from @entity12 , and the relative lack of recuperation time that the players have had in this @entity27 year , @entity101 says it makes " perfect sense " to serve up an exhibition match in @entity0 , en route to @entity118			1
" since the @entity12 @entity20 decided to come to @entity52 to play the @entity117 it makes sense to come earlier , " he says			1
" to come here and to meet with our partners and sponsors			0
" tours criticized this year , there has been criticism of the demands of summer tours from other top managers , including @entity58 side @entity91 's @entity159 and new @entity92 boss @entity160			2
@entity10 's head coach @entity161 , however , argues that the commercial aspects of the club 's summer plans do not interfere with his players ' fitness , or their preparation for a grueling season ahead			0
" it was always ... a good opportunity for the squad to come to @entity52 , especially @entity0 , ahead of the @entity174 ( @entity117 ) in @entity118 so it was all planned , there is no problem at at , " the @entity170 winner told @entity1			1
he also said that the team did n't need to stoop to scrapping for the allegiance of fans in @entity52			0
" without any ( arrogance ) , @entity10 is one of the greatest football teams in @entity56 , so it 's already ( a jewel ) of the football world ... there 's nothing to pretend , nothing to compete			0
" visiting fans while other top managers bemoan the travel time and physical demands that these tours put on their squads , @entity10 is a relative newcomer to the @entity52 market and welcomes the opportunity to meet potential devotees -- and convert some undecideds			1
" it 's part of being a great football club , " says @entity101			0
" you have to come and see your fans , otherwise you can not expand and you can not compete			0
" he added that there were further plans to travel to the @entity205 , home of the club 's wealthy @entity207 backers , in the @entity12 season 's winter break , a time traditionally reserved for teams to recuperate			2
and with a 6 - 2 scoreline to take to @entity118 for next week 's @entity215 , and a host of potential fans who will be increasingly likely to tune into @entity10 's @entity12 and @entity220 games next season , overseas detours like this are n't going away any time soon .			1

@entity12 @entity20 champion beats @entity0 's @entity5 6 - 2 in a friendly in the @entity52 city
overseas tours -- especially to @entity52 -- are part of the *landscape* of *modern* football
this year 's @entity117 , the traditional season - opener , was moved to @entity118
