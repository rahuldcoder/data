-- overweight people with a history of heart disease who take the prescription weight - loss drug @entity5 may be at increased risk of heart attack or stroke , according to a study published this week in the @entity10			1
the study confirms longstanding concerns about the safety of @entity5 in people with heart disease and other heart problems , who are already warned against taking the drug			1
a @entity19 ( @entity19 ) advisory committee is scheduled to meet later this month to discuss the possibility of increased regulation for @entity5			1
the meeting was prompted by the preliminary results from the study , known as @entity26 , which were released by the agency in november 2009			0
@entity0 : 9 surprising heart attack risks in the study -- which was sponsored by the drug 's maker , @entity32 -- researchers followed 10,744 overweight and obese people who had heart disease or type 2 diabetes and a risk factor for heart disease ( such as high blood pressure ) for about 3.5 years			1
during that time , 4.1 percent and 2.6 percent of the people taking @entity5 had a nonfatal heart attack or stroke , respectively , compared with 3.2 percent and 1.9 percent of the people taking a placebo pill			1
that translates into a 28 percent increased risk of heart attack and a 36 percent increased risk of stroke , according to the study			1
however , @entity5 did not appear to increase the risk of heart attack or stroke in diabetics with no history of heart disease			1
nor did the researchers find any differences in the death rates from heart attack , stroke , or other causes in people taking @entity5 versus placebo			1
@entity0 : heart trouble ? 30 herbal remedies to avoid lead researcher @entity66 , @entity67 , an obesity expert at the @entity69 , in the @entity70 , says that the study underscores that @entity5 should not be prescribed to people with existing heart problems			2
but , he adds , " it does not prove that you should extrapolate the data to the normal population for which the drug is intended			0
" the active ingredient in @entity5 , sibutramine , suppresses appetite by affecting levels of the brain chemicals serotonin and norepinephrine			0
the drug is designed to be used by overweight and obese people , not by people who are a bit chubby and are trying to slim down			0
@entity0 : 25 diet - busting foods you should never eat @entity5 has been shown to slightly raise blood pressure and heart rate , and the cardiovascular risk associated with the drug has been known for years			2
since being approved by the @entity19 in 1997 , @entity5 has carried a warning on its label that says the drug should not be used in people with a history of heart disease , heart failure , heart - rhythm problems , or stroke			1
in january 2010 , after reviewing the preliminary data from the scout study , the @entity19 asked @entity32 to strengthen the warning			0
the @entity107 -- the @entity109 equivalent of the @entity19 -- chose to suspend sales of the drug in the @entity112			0
in an editorial accompanying the study , three @entity10 editors suggest that the heart risk associated with @entity5 is not justified by the weight loss seen in the study -- about 9.5 pounds ( or 4.5 percent of initial body weight ) after one year , on average			2
" [ @entity123 ] t is difficult to discern a credible rationale for keeping this medication on the market , " the editors write			0
@entity0 : three new weight - loss drugs : will they work ? the @entity19 would be going too far if it pulled the drug from the market , says @entity131 , @entity67 , associate executive director for clinical research at the @entity133 , in @entity134 , @entity135			0
she notes that the patients taking @entity5 who were at greater risk for heart attack and stroke in the scout study -- those with preexisting cardiovascular disease -- are already precluded from taking the drug			1
the study should not be interpreted to mean that the drug should n't be used at all , says @entity146 , who prior to 2008 served as a consultant for @entity32 and other manufacturers of obesity drugs			0
" the study does n't really support that , and indeed , in the population where you did n't have preexisting cardiovascular disease ... there is no increased risk , " she says			2
@entity156 , @entity67 , the director of the health research group at @entity158 , a consumer advocacy organization that petitioned the @entity19 to ban @entity5 for safety reasons in 2002 , says that even people who have n't been diagnosed with heart disease should avoid @entity5			1
some obese people have unrecognized heart problems that may be aggravated by the drug , he says			0
@entity5 " should never have been approved in the first place , " @entity166 adds			0
the @entity19 's advisory committee on endocrinologic and metabolic drugs will discuss @entity5 on september 15			2
the agency is not required to follow the committee 's recommendations , but it typically does			0

those with a history of heart disease who take @entity5 may be at high risk of heart attack
the @entity19 is scheduled to meet this month to discuss increased regulation for @entity5
the study showed a 28 percent increased heart attack risk and a 36 percent increased stroke risk
