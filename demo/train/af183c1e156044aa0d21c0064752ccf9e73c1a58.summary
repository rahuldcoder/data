-- fresh accusations that the @entity3 regime has used chemical weapons in the ongoing civil war have led many to renew calls for the world to take stronger actions to stop the growing humanitarian crisis			0
but recent polls have shown @entity12 are very reluctant to support military interventions in @entity14			1
in a @entity18 / @entity17 poll , as few as 5 % of respondents were willing to commit troops to the cause			0
the @entity22 administration has been similarly hesitant to get involved in @entity14			2
@entity23 : is @entity14 war escalating to wider conflict ? while the administration has made some efforts to respond to humanitarian crises elsewhere in the world -- the @entity12 joined @entity31 in its successful mission to assist @entity34 rebels , military advisers have been sent to @entity35 to combat the @entity36 and to @entity37 to help @entity14 rebels -- full - scale military intervention in @entity14 does not appear to be on the table			1
read more : opposition source -- @entity14 rebels get @entity12 - organized training in @entity37 president @entity22 's varying view on humanitarian intervention is in keeping with over 20 years of inconsistent @entity12 policy on the issue			1
over the last 20 years , the @entity12 government has chosen to intervene in @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , and @entity34 while resisting calls to take action in @entity55 and @entity56			2
read more : 5 reasons @entity14 's war suddenly looks more dangerous to better predict whether the @entity12 will intervene in @entity14 , or any other similar crisis , we must understand why @entity61 selectively engages in humanitarian intervention missions			1
our recent research on when and why the @entity12 engages in humanitarian intervention emphasizes two factors that might force the @entity12 government 's hand on humanitarian intervention : public opinion and @entity71 partisanship			1
we analyzed public opinion polls and congressional votes during four episodes of humanitarian intervention -- @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity49 and @entity50 -- and found , as recent debates seems to suggest , humanitarian intervention is mired in the mundane world of politics			1
contrary to conventional wisdom , politics do not end at " water 's edge			0
" there is some good news to report : both the general public and individual legislators understand and are responsive to the moral imperative of stopping humanitarian crises			0
the public is generally supportive of humanitarian missions			0
even in the recent polls on @entity14 , respondents believe something should be done , even if they are unsupportive of military action by the @entity12			1
opinion : give peace talks in @entity14 a chance further , @entity71 is not wholly unresponsive to public preferences regarding intervention in humanitarian emergencies			1
legislative support is more likely in cases where public opinion generally favors intervention			0
those who push for more humanitarian missions can increase support for such missions by raising public outcry for action			2
but the bad news is that humanitarian crises , like in @entity14 , which should rise above politics as usual , are often mired in that very spot			2
opinion : why the @entity14 quagmire threatens @entity115 although public opinion appears to have an influence on legislative behavior , traditional factors such as partisanship have the strongest influence on how legislators cast their votes			0
humanitarian intervention is most likely when the @entity12 president enjoys a majority in @entity71			1
in the case of the 1990s , humanitarian interventions failed to get off the ground when president @entity130 lost majorities in @entity71			0
if @entity12 politics is becoming increasingly partisan , future administrations should have an even harder time galvanizing the domestic support they need to address any humanitarian crises			1
opinion : @entity22 's no - win options in @entity14 this does not mean , however , that humanitarian intervention will only occur when a president enjoys a majority in @entity71			1
as the recently launched humanitarian missions suggest , politicians are learning the lessons of the 1990s and circumventing @entity71			0
this helps explain why president @entity22 's decision to contribute the @entity12 military to @entity31 operations in @entity34 proceeded without @entity71 authorization ; the president was surely aware that such a vote would go down to defeat in a @entity156 - controlled @entity155 and deeply partisan @entity157			2
@entity71 was similarly bypassed in october 2011 when the administration deployed military advisers to @entity35			0
@entity71 was similarly bypassed in 2011 and 2013 when the administration deployed military advisers to @entity35 and @entity37 , respectively			0
for those who advocate for a strong humanitarian intervention in @entity14 , our research does not paint a completely gloomy picture			1
instead , it simply suggests that domestic political will is a necessary precondition for intervention missions and should not be overlooked			1
it is important to recognize that partisan bickering and political jockeying shape responses to humanitarian crises just as in trade policy , arms control , and immigration politics			0
while the atrocities are singular in their importance , the politics of dealing with them are not			0
for those eager to craft a uniform and effective international response to humanitarian crises as in @entity14 , they must first turn their attention to domestic politics			1
the political elites who must decide when , whether , where and how to fulfill the responsibility to protect , face their own domestic political battles			2
ignoring these contexts threatens to over-simplify both the problems and the promises of humanitarian intervention			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 , @entity200 and @entity201 .			0

*experts* : @entity61 selectively engages in humanitarian intervention missions
domestic political will is a necessary precondition for intervention missions , they say
polls show @entity12 are very reluctant to support military interventions in @entity14
