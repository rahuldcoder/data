-- " he who has not climbed the @entity3 is not a real man , " the @entity0 like to say			1
i 've taken up that challenge many times over			1
i first climbed the @entity3 in august 1971 , soon after i arrived in @entity0 as a tourist			1
i still remember my excitement and awe when i scaled its @entity12 section , 85 km northwest of @entity13			1
it is , after all , the longest man - made structure in the world , stretching 8,851 km ( 5,500 miles ) long			2
it is said to be one of the @entity20			2
i 've lost count now but in the 40 years that i 've lived in @entity0 , i must have climbed it about 80 times			1
that includes a trip onto the @entity26 section , where the wall starts near the seaside resort of @entity29 in the east and a trek to the @entity32 in @entity33 , where the wall ends in the west			2
in @entity13 and its surroundings , the @entity3 is 629 km ( 391 miles ) long with five sections , including the @entity12 , the first one opened to tourists in 1957			1
i 've climbed the major sections but one thing remained on my wish list : to sleep overnight on the @entity3			1
it 's one of those rites of passage , especially for adventure enthusiasts , history buffs and adrenaline seekers			1
one sultry summer day recently , i joined members of the @entity52 ( @entity52 ) , a group of professional and amateur camera buffs , and embarked to realize my wish			2
we rented a mini-bus that took us at the foot of @entity58 section , located in the mountainous areas in @entity60 , @entity61 province , 125 kms ( 78 miles ) northeast of @entity13			2
the @entity58 section was first built in 1368 during the @entity63 and was rebuilt and restored over the centuries			2
now it is 10.5 km ( 6.5 miles ) long with five passes , 67 towers and two beacon towers			2
i traveled light , with one backpack ( spare clothes , boiled eggs , fruit , chocolate bars , and bottled water ) and a sling bag ( cameras , a whistle , small flashlight , knife , wipes , pen and notebook , and a photocopy of my passport			1
) of course , i lugged a sleeping bag			1
we were lucky to have several trained mountaineers among us who gently reminded us of their maxim , " take nothing but picture , leave nothing but footprint , kill nothing but time			2
" it turned out to be a moderate trek , although some sections were steep and treacherous			0
bricks and rubbles in some parts were loose due to wear and tear			0
some 4,632 steps later ( according to my mini-pedometer ) , we reached the @entity103 , a two - storey watch tower built in 1579			0
we chose as our camp site			0
on top of the tower , half as big as a tennis court , we staked our sleeping areas			1
we caught our breath and took pictures to catch the spectacular scenery as the light fades			0
gazing at the panoramic view atop the rampart , i was reminded of an ancient phrase , " land is under my feet ; the world is mine			0
" i felt like a real man			0
come nightfall , we looked up the sky dotted by stars and listened to the silence of the night			0
we took a lot of pictures			0
combining long - exposure and light - painting techniques , our intrepid @entity52 photographers took stunning souvenir photos , including a few frames featuring our favorite acronyms , @entity1 and @entity52 , in the background			0
as we all tried to sleep , someone suggested that i recount to the group how i came to @entity0 40 years ago and what i 've been doing since then			1
it turned out to be a good way to put some members to sleep			1
we all woke up to an overcast day , but still one with unique hues			0
as we walked home , @entity58 beckoned like a dragon snaking along the lush and rugged hills			0
all these years , the @entity0 government has used the @entity3 as an iconic symbol of national pride and unity			1
still , @entity0 struggles with how to manage and protect the @entity3 as it promotes mass - market tourism			1
during the climb , we encountered several workers who were repairing the steps of one steep section of @entity58			0
" we are doing this to make it safe for hikers , " one worker told me			0
i pointed at a half - collapsed rampart nearby and asked if they planned to restore it too			0
" no , " he said , " we will keep its original state			0
what makes climbing the @entity3 , specially the unrestored sections , so special ? " appreciating history and escaping the hustle and bustle of the city and the pollution , " @entity52 stalwart @entity169 tells me			1
a professional photographer , @entity169 has climbed the wall more than a dozen times and has camped on it three times			0
what advice can we offer to people who wish to follow our steps ? " three tips , " says @entity169			0
" food and water ( to share ) ; a sleeping bag or a warm hug ( to share ) and friends and stories ( to share )			1

the @entity3 is symbol of national pride and unity
@entity0 struggles with how to manage and protect it as it promotes mass market tourism
there are rites of passage *attached* to the @entity3 ; one is to sleep on it
those who do should bring food and water to share , a sleeping bag and stories
