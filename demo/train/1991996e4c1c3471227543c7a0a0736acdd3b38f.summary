@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 turns eight years old this week			1
his birthday will be anything but normal			0
last thursday his @entity10 adoptive family put him on a solo , trans - @entity8 flight from the @entity10 to @entity0			1
they hired a @entity1 driver to deliver the boy from the airport to the @entity1 @entity17			1
@entity1 officials allowed @entity2 to see a copy of a letter addressed to the @entity17 and signed by @entity22 's adoptive mother , @entity21 , which the little boy carried when he arrived			1
" to whom it may concern , " the letter reads , " this child is mentally unstable			0
he is violent and has severe psychopathic issues / behaviors			0
i was lied to and misled by the @entity1 orphanage workers and director regarding his mental stability ... after giving my best to this child , i am sorry to say that for the safety of my family , friends and myself , i no longer wish to parent this child			2
as he is a @entity1 national , i am returning him to your guardianship and would like the adoption disannulled [ sic ]			1
" @entity1 officials are fuming at these accusations			1
" how can you imagine that a 7 - year - old boy can be [ a ] menace or danger for the family ? for the adult people ? " said @entity50 , @entity1 's @entity51			1
" [ @entity53 ] is in very good mental and physical condition , " @entity50 said			2
" he 's a very nice boy			0
and he 's very communicative			0
" @entity50 met with @entity56 several times since he arrived in @entity0 , as have officials from the @entity10 embassy			2
" when we saw him , he looked like a very tired little boy off a long trans - @entity8 flight , " said @entity59 , the @entity10 ambassador in @entity0			1
the case of @entity22 comes after the @entity1 media focused intense attention on several previous cases in recent years of abuse involving adopted @entity1 children in the @entity10			1
not surprisingly , some @entity1 are calling for an end to the practice of foreign adoption			2
" i am against the idea of sending our children abroad , " said a woman , who gave her name only as @entity75 , as she watched her grandchildren play on a sunny day in a @entity0 park			1
@entity1 officials have made public appeals for a temporary freeze of @entity10 adoption of @entity1 children until a proposed bilateral treaty has been signed to allow monitoring of children after they are brought to the @entity10			1
" we do n't have any instrument or tools to control our children which are living in adoptive families , " said @entity50			0
" in this situation we have a kind of legal vacuum ... we have to freeze all activity in the adoptive process for the @entity10			2
" those are ominous words for thousands of desperate @entity10 families who end up waiting years and spending tens of thousands of dollars trying to adopt @entity1 children			1
according to the @entity101 in @entity0 , more then 50,000 @entity1 children have been adopted by @entity10 families in the last 16 years			1
the @entity103 offered to send a delegation of diplomats to @entity0 later this month to address the adoption issue			0
" the @entity1 government has now told us informally that that 's acceptable			0
we 're actually working out the dates , " said @entity59			0
" so i would say to @entity10 families that are in the process of adoption not to worry too much			0
we 're working on this , and we really do n't think that this will have any long - term effect on the ability of @entity10 families to adopt here			2
" @entity1 has no shortage of orphans			0
the @entity120 @entity119 reported that in 2008 , some 714,000 @entity1 children were living in state institutions			2
unlike many @entity126 societies , the vast majority -- 83 percent of these children -- are " social orphans " taken from biological parents who were deemed unfit by @entity1 state agencies , said @entity130 , @entity131 's representative in @entity0			2
" what is important to draw out of this [ @entity22 's ] case is to conduct a thorough analysis on the adoption of the child , then to [ learn ] what happened when he was put back on the plane , " @entity130 said			1
he also called for a bilateral treaty to prevent future cases of abuse from occurring			0
both @entity10 and @entity1 officials predicted it might take a matter of months to hammer out this proposed agreement			1
but that offers little consolation to @entity148 , who has now lost two families before reaching the age of 8			0
" he lost his native family , his mother			0
and he lost his adoptive family , @entity21 , " said @entity50			0
" now the best way is to place him in a new family which can give him attention and love			0
" but @entity50 made it clear any new family for @entity22 would be a @entity1 one .			1

@entity1 officials allowed @entity2 to see a copy of a letter sent to @entity1 with 7 - year - old @entity22
official " how can you imagine that a 7 - year - old boy can be [ a ] menace or a danger ... ? "
@entity171 *shared* now by many @entity1 : " i am against the idea of sending our children abroad "
@entity1 media have focused on several previous cases of abused adoptees in @entity10
