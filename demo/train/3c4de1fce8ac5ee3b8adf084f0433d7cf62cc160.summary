@entity1 -- " lift the siege			0
" " stop the rockets			0
" the dialogue of the deaf continues after nearly three weeks of conflict and well over 700 deaths			1
@entity8 has rejected one @entity10 proposal to silence the guns			2
it wants assurances that any deal includes an end to the blockade that has wrecked @entity18 's economy and impoverished its people			2
no , says @entity20 : stop firing rockets and then we 'll talk about it			2
@entity8 is a resilient organization			2
fighters of its military wing have put up stiff resistance to the @entity20 ground incursion			1
but it has few friends in the @entity32 world , and the @entity32 street has not risen in solidarity			0
and this time , @entity20 leaders are publicly and persistently demanding what they call the ' demilitarization ' of @entity18 as the price for peace - so that @entity20 is spared another barrage of rockets like those that fell on its soil in 2008 and 2012 - and are again now			1
to that end @entity20 wants to ensure that @entity8 can acquire neither the raw materials it needs to make thousands more rockets nor get its hands on more advanced missiles			1
it is also determined to eradicate the maze of tunnels that @entity8 uses to support its infrastructure and infiltrate the border			2
@entity20 military officers say they believe most if not all the tunnels have been identified -- more than 60 access shafts leading to some 31 tunnels as of thursday			1
in other words the @entity20 aim is a lasting change in the landscape			2
the @entity63 and @entity64 have warmed to the idea			0
" one of the results , one would hope , of a cease - fire would be some form of demilitarization , so that again , this does n't continue , " said @entity63 deputy national security advisor @entity66			2
so how do you define ' demilitarization ? ' what sort of weapons does it include ? who guarantees and polices it ? is it even conceivable @entity8 would give up in negotiation an arsenal it has spent years building up ? @entity83 -- leader of @entity8 political wing -- insisted tuesday : " nobody can break the will of the resistance and no one can get rid of its weapons			1
only two conditions can get rid of the weapons of the resistance -- firstly the ending of the occupation and second the demilitarization of @entity20			1
" obviously impossible demands , but @entity98 , senior analyst with the @entity99 of the @entity100 , says " there 's no way @entity8 will ever accept demilitarization in exchange for changes in @entity18			1
" is there a halfway house which would provide @entity20 with sufficient security guarantees ? nothing yet on the horizon			1
the trouble for @entity8 is that its main ally , @entity10 's former president @entity113 , is now in jail			2
and the man who ousted him , president @entity115 , has moved to isolate @entity8 , economically and militarily , by closing the smuggling tunnels into @entity18			1
crudely put , he shares @entity20 's view that @entity8 is ruining the neighborhood			1
so @entity10 is in the driving seat , as @entity63 secretary of state @entity121 has recognized by making @entity123 the first port of call in his latest shuttle			0
his ' phone - bashing ' has been intense -- bringing in @entity20 , the @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , the @entity131 foreign minister and more			1
but one of his predecessors , @entity134 , told @entity2 that one problem was working out " who has any influence over @entity8 in order to get them to accept a cease - fire			2
" for @entity8 any deal must include what it calls the " lifting of the siege " -- the blockade of @entity18 that has turned it into an open prison for the last eight years			1
" we will not accept any proposal that does not lift the blockade , " said @entity83			2
a truce in @entity18 perhaps , but he would not agree to a lasting cease - fire unless blockade terms had been negotiated			2
at issue then , how can each side get enough to wave in front of their people as victory ? and what 's the sequence : truce , then negotiations , and only then a full cease - fire ? the whispers and hints suggest so			0
@entity8 is wary of being trapped like it was in 2012 , when a truce was agreed but longer - term issues never resolved			2
@entity8 is aware that above all the people of @entity18 are gasping for the chance to breathe a more normal life			1
" we would rather be dead than live this life			0
" @entity2 correspondents in @entity18 have heard that and similar refrains time and again			0
the detailed terms of any opening of @entity18 will probably not be agreed as part of an initial truce			0
there are too many questions			0
who monitors the border crossing with @entity10 at @entity182 ? the @entity183 ? the @entity10 military ? @entity20 officials seem ready at least to consider a force from the @entity187 , says @entity98 of the @entity100			0
and he believes that @entity20 " may be moving -- albeit grudgingly -- towards accepting a reconciliation government among the @entity127 that allows @entity189 ' @entity187 to regain a foothold in @entity18 , " not least because @entity10 will only talk to @entity189			1
what sort of goods would be allowed in from @entity20 into @entity18 via the @entity194 crossing , which handles freight ? @entity20 complains that most of the cement smuggled into @entity18 in recent years from @entity10 ( and some allowed in from @entity20 ) has been used for @entity8 tunnels -- not houses			1
what about the port of @entity18 ? there are other issues -- including the release of @entity8 supporters arrested in the @entity205 since the abduction and murder of three @entity20 teenagers last month and the ability of farmers to tend land along the fringes of @entity18			1
fishing rights of @entity127 in @entity18 would also likely be discussed			0
some in the @entity214 have expressed surprise at the scale and intensity of the resistance they have met and the extent of the tunnel network , dubbed by one @entity20 official as " @entity18			1
" rather than prod the @entity20 government towards a cease - fire , the resistance may make it more determined to degrade @entity8 ' capabilities for a while longer			1
@entity228 has no problem with that			0
but a deeper invasion into @entity18 is fraught with peril , says @entity98			0
the @entity20 , he notes , are just one kilometer inside @entity18 and taking much heavier casualties than they did in 2008 - 09			1
@entity8 is not without friends altogether			0
the wealthy emirate of @entity128 is close to the @entity236 , from which @entity8 sprang , and has embarked on a diplomatic drive with @entity131 to bring peace and reconstruction to @entity18			1
but @entity131 's prime minister , @entity240 , has made incendiary comparisons between @entity20 's conduct in @entity18 and @entity243 -- and described the incursion as " systematic genocide , " ruling himself out of any role as the region 's ' honest broker			1
' and @entity20 ministers see @entity128 as complicit in bankrolling @entity8			1
one long - term proposal that was floated before the latest conflict involves the international community demilitarizing @entity18 in return for massive investment -- 50 billion dollars -- in the territory			1
it comes from a former @entity20 defense minister , @entity256			0
" people say demilitarization is unrealistic , but the alternatives of going through this again in a year or two or capturing @entity18 are unacceptable , " @entity256 told the @entity257			1
[ @entity187 president @entity262 ] " @entity189 would be in a better position if he came into @entity18 with $ 50 billion than if he was brought in on an @entity214 tank , " @entity256 said			0
he 's looking to @entity265 and the @entity266 to lead that process			0
few believe the @entity187 has the resources to administer such a @entity269			0
such an ambitious vision seems far away right now , almost impossible , some say			0
@entity63 officials say they are focused on the next days , not weeks nor months nor years			0
" right now our focus is on stopping the rocket fire so that we can begin a serious negotiation on the key issues			0
what we 're trying to figure out is how do we get to a point where the violence can stop and these bigger , key issues can be addressed over the long term , " said a senior @entity63 official			0
writing in foreign policy , @entity283 is deeply pessimistic about the long term			0
" when it comes to @entity18 , " he says , " do n't dream about demilitarization or economic miracles			1
in fact , forget the endgame			0
right now , summoning the urgency , the right mediator , and a deal to stop the killing will be hard enough			0
" but that 's what the people of @entity18 most desperately need -- before they can even dream of greater freedoms .			2

the @entity18 conflict has lasted almost three weeks with over 700 deaths
@entity20 leaders are demanding the ' demilitarization ' of @entity18
@entity83 -- leader of @entity8 political wing -- is against this
is there a halfway house providing @entity20 with security guarantees ?
