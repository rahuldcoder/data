-- there is little argument that @entity4 's respect in the @entity6 world has lessened as we enter our 10th year of war against a deadly shadow enemy of religious extremists who wear no uniform , wave no flag and who use their holy book as sword and shield against fellow @entity6 as well as all things @entity4			1
so what does @entity18 , pastor of the @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21 , hope to accomplish by calling for a " @entity23 " this saturday , september 11 , the ninth anniversary of the worst sneak attack on @entity4 soil in our 234 - year history ? the answers are as obvious as they are ominous : he will bring total contempt from the world 's fastest - growing religion against the world 's oldest democracy			1
he will destroy the goodwill generations of @entity4 have worked to create in almost every nation			1
he will -- in just a few seconds of self - proclaimed glory and protest -- paint a target on the backs of @entity4 troops , diplomats , foreign service employees , humanitarian relief workers and @entity4 tourists			1
worse , still , @entity18 and his followers will provide our enemies with a propaganda tool that will outlast our lives and those of our children and their children			0
burning a quran will instantly undo everything good that @entity4 has done in the world			2
@entity4 's top general in @entity58 , @entity59 , recognizes the consequences of such an act			2
" images of the burning of a @entity54 would undoubtedly be used by extremists in @entity58 -- and around the world -- to inflame public opinion and incite violence , " he said in a statement released from his headquarters in @entity64			0
no one will remember when a half - dozen @entity6 nations joined a multinational coalition that included the @entity4 to free @entity73 back in 1991			2
no one will remember @entity4 's huge humanitarian response in @entity76 after the devastating 2004 tsunami or in @entity78 after this year 's disastrous flooding			2
no one will remember countless other projects to build schools and roadways and efforts to bring clean drinking water to people			0
no one outside the @entity4 will recognize or even care that burning a quran was the act of a single or small group of individuals			0
the only thing the @entity6 world will remember and our enemies will exploit is that the @entity4 government allowed @entity4 to burn the @entity97 holy book in protest without consequence			1
the @entity100 may protect the pastor 's right to protest , but nothing is to be gained and everything is to lose from this self - serving act			1
our nation was founded on religious freedom and tolerance , yet a man of the cloth wants to invoke memories of a not - so - proud history when a developing @entity4 did n't want @entity113 or @entity114 but did want slaves			2
if the good pastor wants to protest something on the side of the righteous , i would suggest he divert his energies against the rev. @entity121 and the @entity122 of @entity123 , @entity124			0
for the better part of this decade , @entity125 and his followers have been protesting around the country at the funerals of fallen military members , carrying signs that say " thank @entity132 for @entity133			0
" he is now the subject of a @entity100 case scheduled before the @entity4 @entity136 next month			0
[ @entity137 ] religion has been the rallying cry of almost every war in recorded history , and there are those in our country as well as in @entity6 countries who truly believe that this is the start of a war between @entity97 and nonbelievers			0
" @entity4 is not at war with @entity97 " is a statement that has been repeated publicly and repeated often by presidents and members of @entity153 from all political persuasions , not because it is politically correct but because it is true			1
@entity4 is at war , however , against a small number of religious extremists who hide behind women and children and kill indiscriminately without remorse			1
we must not allow an equally small number of religious extremists in @entity4 to widen the war by burning the @entity54 ... or @entity166 or @entity167			1
@entity4 is far better than that			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity171 .			0

@entity173 : pastor 's plan to burn @entity176 on 9 - 11 *endangers* @entity4 *soldiers* , tourists , diplomats
it will undo all goodwill @entity4 has built up , @entity171 argues , for generations to come
*dangerous* extremists will exploit the act planned by @entity4 religious extremists , he says
" @entity4 is not at war with @entity97 " is not politically correct , @entity171 says ; it is true
