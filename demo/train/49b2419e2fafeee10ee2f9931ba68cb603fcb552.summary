-- @entity1 have been repeatedly shocked by school violence this year -- first in @entity3 , where in october a student shot and killed a teacher and wounded two students before taking his own life ; then days later by the news that the body of a young teacher was found behind her school in @entity12			1
the images of traumatized parents and a campus surrounded by police tape shake us profoundly -- our hearts break for the families of those who died			0
for them , this is the beginning of an unwanted journey			0
in my education research i have focused on the question of what happens in the lives of the people still connected to a school that has endured such a trauma long after the media and law enforcement move on			1
school shootings affect teachers , school secretaries , maintenance people and anyone else on campus at the time			1
how the school , the community and families work together is critical to the long - term recovery of those who witnessed the nightmare			1
it 's important to consider two aspects of life after a school shooting			1
first , what do teachers go through as the days stretch on and , second , what can we learn from past shootings to help the educators in @entity57 ? for teachers who witness school shootings , one diagnosis stands out , and it is well - known in the field of psychology : post-traumatic stress disorder , or @entity66			1
teachers who see a shooting will experience the trauma of the activating event and a series of other emotions : pain , confusion , guilt , shame , a questioning of self - worth , fear , anger , depression , and , sometimes , acute anxiety			1
they may question their very sense of how the world works around them			0
they struggle to find a sense of safety			0
teacher slayings hurt view of schools as safe havens if @entity66 is not dealt with , the quality of the teacher 's life can degrade rapidly			2
psychiatric clinician @entity94 has described how , left untreated , these changes can become permanent			0
victims of untreated ptsd can degrade into rigid thinking , paranoia , defensiveness , over-reactivity and health problems			0
this can have serious ramifications for students in their classrooms			0
they might find their teacher more and more withdrawn , less willing to engage intellectually or emotionally , defensive , sarcastic , inflexible and perhaps emotionally unstable			2
teacher absenteeism -- meaning more substitute teachers -- might become a problem			1
what can we learn from previous shootings that might help the educators in @entity3 ? the most important factor in recovery is quick access to professional crisis counseling			2
crisis counselors must discern how each individual witness deals with @entity66			0
in their trauma research , psychologists @entity124 and @entity126 found that adjustment to trauma is a dynamic process influenced by the intensity of the incident but also by pre-trauma factors -- for example family stability , socioeconomic status			2
personal resilience , which is effected by such things as social support , personality and native coping abilities , plays a role			2
this is why past experience teaches us it 's important to get quick professional psychological treatment , tailored to each individual			1
more severe ptsd symptoms , such as recurring nightmares , can arise over time ; it 's crucial that counseling continue to be available and actively offered			2
after the first few weeks have passed , witnesses still need support			2
one of the worst things anyone can do is pressure the witness to " just get over it			0
" past experience suggests that teachers who witness shootings and who have these layers of support from family and community recover more fully and quickly than those who are more isolated			1
and then there is time			0
each person heals at a different pace			0
there will be teachers who will be able to return to their duties in a week or so ; some may need months or years of support and therapy			1
in my own study i compared two teachers recovering after witnessing a school shooting			1
one was able to return within a week and had extended support from district and local mental health professionals for some time			2
a mental health professional checked in on him weekly , even a year later			0
the other teacher had no such support			1
she was not even offered counseling			0
her world , demonstrating van der @entity94 's assertions , descended into defensiveness and health problems			0
she was unable to function after a month back on the job			0
school administrators should understand that a teacher going back into the classroom may be an unknown ; their post-shooting self may still be struggling in many ways			1
unfortunately a 2005 study found that 75 % of school districts affected by campus shootings did not require counseling for teacher witnesses			1
coordinating a re-entry plan with a professional psychologist can be fundamental to restoring a witness to a productive and healthy life			0
finally , research indicates that the more connected a witness feels to the school , to his or her family , and to the community , the better the possibility for long - term healing			1
school administrators , by routinely fostering relationships through off - campus faculty parties , softball games and other group activities , could be setting up a safety net that could smooth over a transition for future trauma victims			1
one of the participants in my study regularly went on recreational events with co-workers			0
he mentioned how these same people felt connected to him and were there for him after the shooting			0
they knew him , knew when he needed alone time and when he needed to be around people			0
while this can not prevent a tragedy , it can set up mechanisms to assist in healing			0
in the weeks and months that follow , administrators , community members , family members and colleagues should be sensitive to events , objects and other factors that may cause heightened anxiety and panic attacks			2
to guide teachers , administrators will need professional advice from psychologists			2
beyond these things , what can the rest of us do to help ? first of all , be a part of your local school			2
teachers , students , administrators and other school workers need to feel valued and respected			1
be a part of the process to find ways to make schools safer			0
secondly , encourage your local school leaders to develop school morale , to develop crisis management plans and to foster a community feeling around the school			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity277			1

@entity277 : after school violence , teacher trauma must be addressed
he says psychological help , community support crucial for these teachers
he says without treatment teachers ' *behavior* can suffer
@entity290 : fostering strong school communities aids recovery in the event of trauma
