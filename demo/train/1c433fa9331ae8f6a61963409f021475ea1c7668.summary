-- i once met a mother who named her newborn daughter @entity3			1
yes , like the car			2
apparently she had one and liked it so much that she wanted to be reminded of it each time she said her baby 's name			2
as we stood there , i could tell this was something she was very proud of , and so i tried my best not to look embarrassed for her			2
besides , who was i to judge ? i 'm named after a useless , deadbeat father			1
at least the car had resale value			2
one day , the new mom may regret her decision			2
one day , her daughter may stop talking to her , opting to let the therapy bills do the talking for her			0
or maybe it 's the beginning of a new family tradition that lasts generations			0
who knows ? it 's different , but ultimately what we name our children is no one else 's business			1
it certainly is n't something the government should ever be involved with , which of course means it recently became something the government got involved with			0
in an egregious abuse of power , @entity42 , a child support magistrate serving the 4th @entity43 of @entity44 , recently took it upon herself to rename @entity48 's child because according to @entity42 , the name @entity50 originally chose " has only been earned by one person , and that one person is @entity53			1
" now admittedly if you 're going to name your child " messiah , " as @entity50 did , you should expect some raised brows			1
maybe even from the father , though reportedly the case was brought to @entity60 because of a dispute over the child 's last name , not the first			1
" i was shocked , " @entity50 said			0
" i never intended on naming my son @entity64 because it means @entity66 , and i did n't think a judge could make me change my baby 's name because of her religious beliefs			1
" she can -- and did -- but should n't have			0
in all likelihood , @entity42 's ruling naming the child " @entity73 " will be overturned in an appeal , and the fiasco will go down as a waste of taxpayer dollars			1
all of which serves as an uneasy reminder that separation of church and state is an ongoing process			0
while the judge overstepped her boundaries , she is right when she said the name messiah " could put him at odds with a lot of people			0
" a similar impulse might help explain why @entity93 , a @entity94 man who named one of his sons @entity97 , does not have custody of his children			1
" @entity102 " is going to be alright because her parents -- @entity103 and @entity104 -- are rich and famous			1
but for us regular folks , when you name your son something peculiar such as " @entity53 " -- as 29 moms did in 2012 according to the @entity111 -- you 're opening the kid up for unnecessary ridicule			0
i spoke with a handful of @entity118 professionals who told me off the record they would be hesitant to bring in someone with a controversial name such as " messiah " if they were hiring for a conservative company			0
it is very similar to the impact of having an address based in a poor neighborhood on the resume			0
and consider this : researchers combing through @entity134 records found that more than 100 years ago , the 20 most popular names were largely the same for blacks and whites , but after the 1970s , that number became much smaller			1
and a study conducted by the @entity140 did show that the " whiter " sounding names on a resume were 50 % more likely to get a call back from an employer than a more ethnic sounding one			2
another analysis by that group suggests the reason for this is n't directly because of the applicant 's race but rather over the past 20 years , certain names have been linked to certain socio - economic status			2
and we know other minorities such as @entity157 and @entity158 have been known to ditch their more ethnic name to blend in and / or avoid having constantly to tell people how to pronounce their name			0
" @entity164 " may be a boring , but it is burdenless			0
then again , you ca n't get more ethnic sounding than " @entity167			0
" and he has a pretty good job			0
maybe there 's room for @entity64 and @entity172 at the top as well			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity176 .			1

@entity176 : parents are entitled to name their children as they choose
a magistrate renamed a child whose mother had named " @entity64 "
@entity176 says the ruling will be overturned on appeal and was a waste of tax dollars
@entity190 : parents should think about *consequences* of names they choose
