-- when @entity2 works with teenage girls in @entity4 as part of her job at @entity7 , she relies on her upbeat , positive nature and styling expertise to get her through an occasional tough appointment			1
" i admit there are some who are very specific and will not try anything other than what they want , " @entity16 says , " those i really have to work harder with and i 'll try and find something to please them			2
" but @entity16 says many of the girls that come to her are so excited to just get a prom dress that they put away any preconceived notions			2
" the majority of my young ladies that come in are open			2
they trust me , they trust my opinion and they 're able to find something that they really like			2
" as was the case with 19 - year - old high school student @entity34 , who came to @entity16 to find a dress a week before her prom			2
@entity34 is getting her dress for free because of the work of @entity7 , a nonprofit organization that helps teens in financial need , or who are sick or disabled , get formal wear for no cost			1
after selecting a few bright colors from her collection in her equally brightly colored private studio , @entity16 gently encourages @entity48 to try on strapless dresses , a style she would n't normally choose			1
" again i always advise the young ladies that come in just to try on a dress because some things do n't have great hanger appeal , " @entity16 tells @entity48 , " but once you put it on you will probably fall in love with it , so let 's just try			1
" @entity34 ended up choosing a short , white , strapless dress that day to attend the @entity61 prom , with @entity16 throwing in accessories and a free hair and makeup session			0
for @entity34 's family , it could n't have come at a better time			1
@entity34 's adoptive mother , @entity69 , says an expensive prom dress was just out of reach for her			0
she 's a single mom with two other children and adopted @entity34 , who has cerebral palsy , 2Â½ years ago			0
they came to the @entity75 last year , and this year are again amazed by the outreach of the organization			0
@entity69 says @entity16 and @entity7 are doing a phenomenal job of helping parents who are not fortunate enough to spend thousands of dollars on the whole prom experience for their children			1
not having thousands of dollars for prom is something that @entity16 can certainly relate to			0
there was a time when @entity16 herself had to face starting over with very little			0
in august 2005 , @entity16 thought what many in @entity88 did at the time			2
that @entity90 was just another storm so she 's take a break for a while and visit friends and family in @entity4			0
it turned out to be anything but just another storm			0
because they left everything back home in @entity102 , @entity16 and her family had to make a new life in a new city			0
" coming ( to @entity4 ) and having to start over , it was a tedious experience for my family , but i 've grown up with some very strong women so there 's nothing that we ca n't tackle			1
" after @entity90 hit and @entity16 finally got back on her feet , the economy dealt her a second blow			0
@entity16 lost her job working as a corporate trainer , and says after those experiences she decided that she never wanted to feel like she was backed up against a wall with nothing to fall back on			0
" i think with @entity90 and moving here to @entity4 i always said to myself , i do n't want to ever not have a second option			2
" now styling girls like @entity48 is just one part of @entity16 ' busy schedule			0
she has a full - time job as the owner of @entity133 , a formal dress boutique in @entity4			2
she is also a personal stylist and shopper			0
the styling goes hand in hand with her job as the @entity4 chapter director for @entity7			1
@entity16 does " wardrobe audits " with her clients and encourages them to donate dresses that are sitting in their closets			1
she also rents dresses to clients for formal occasions and donates those , as well			1
@entity16 says she got involved with @entity7 so she could reach out to young women in the community and use her talent in the fashion industry to help people			1
as a business owner and a " promologist , " @entity16 is one of many chapter directors making a difference for @entity7			1
formed in @entity161 in 2005 , @entity7 was born when founder @entity162 saw a need in her own community in @entity166			1
" i was an event planner and i was meeting with brides and bridesmaids who had these gorgeous bridesmaid dresses that they spent a lot of money on that they were never going to wear again , " @entity162 says			1
this discovery inspired her to start collecting those unused dresses and donating them her alma mater , @entity177			2
now @entity7 has several chapters across the country , each one with their own " promologist , " a term @entity162 says she came up with to describe the chapter directors because " they know everything there is to know about prom			1
" and @entity7 's reach goes far beyond just dresses			1
this year they paired with the @entity192 to offer free tuxedo rentals for guys			0
it 's just another way @entity162 and her promologists try to think of every angle that may be an added expense for teens			2
" we want them to have the entire prom experience so it 's not just the tuxedo , it 's not just the dress			0
if we can purchase their ticket for them , we 'll do that as well , " @entity162 says			0
" if they need transportation we 'll try to seek out local limousine companies or taxi services			0
" everything that @entity7 gives to students is free , but it does come at a price			1
@entity7 requires that teens who receive their services fill out an application showing that they 're in good academic standing and are eligible to graduate			1
@entity162 adds that the organization does require that students demonstrate financial need , but she says she also realizes that with today 's economy , many families are facing tough times			0
" as long as they complete an application they can come to one of the dress giveaway events , " @entity162 says			0
preparing thousands of dresses across the country is a tall order for @entity7 , so they hold fundraisers , work with retailers and rely on personal donations and a huge army of volunteers to keep afloat			1
a night of glitz and glamour is n't reserved just for students struggling financially			2
@entity7 also reaches out to a hospital in the @entity247 , where each year they transform the cafeteria in to a dance hall			1
they give the 13 - to 18 - year - olds patients the total prom experience for one night including , dresses , tuxes , hair , makeup and dancing			2
" some of the patients there have told their nurses that they completely forgot they were in the hospital , completely forgot they were sick for that night they had so much fun			0
" @entity162 says her all her chapters also work with their local @entity266			0
through the social workers , @entity7 is paired with students who are in foster care or are wards of the state to provide them with formal wear , as well			1
beyond just dresses and tuxedos for a high school rite of passage , @entity162 says @entity7 has always been meant for much more			1
when she created the organization , she decided prom would stand for @entity279			0
to fulfill that goal , @entity7 grants one $ 1,000 leadership scholarship per year and also holds school - supply drives			1
for @entity34 and @entity2 , the simple thrill of matching the right dress with the right girl is something they both leave feeling good about			1
" it definitely made me feel really good because this is what our mission is , " says @entity16			0
" we want to make young ladies have a dream prom			0
