-- do you dare to overshare your kids ' exploits on social media ? from bragging " mommyjackers " and smug " sanctimommies " to pictures of poop - smeared kids and placenta art , blogger @entity5 has seen it all			1
in fact , she 's made a career of cataloging examples from the worst parental offenders on her website @entity17 , @entity20			1
@entity5 has collected examples of the most frequent and flagrant web etiquette violations into a new book , " stfu , parents : the @entity25 , self - @entity26 , and @entity27			1
" read an e-mail q&a with @entity5 below , edited for clarity and brevity : @entity0 : what inspired the website ? @entity5 : i started the site in march 2009 after noticing a lot of " kidformation " in my @entity38 newsfeed			1
several of my friends were new parents , and my feed was suddenly filled with updates about fluctuating fevers , diaper changes and nap times			1
i began thinking this was something others might be experiencing when a friend ( and mom of two ) sent me a few screen shots of her old college friends talking about their " perfect " children in their status updates			1
i had no idea back then just how much parents truly overshare about their kids			1
the examples that inspired the site now seem very tame			2
but regardless of what gets posted , the purpose of the blog has always been to highlight modern parenting trends while having a laugh			2
i 'm interested in discussion and etiquette , but i also want it to be entertaining			2
@entity0 : who contributes the photos and notes ? @entity5 : i 've heard from everyone you could possibly imagine being @entity38 friends with : friends of friends , co-workers , siblings , old high school acquaintances			1
for a long time , the majority of submissions came from nonparents , often people who worked with kids , like nannies , baby sitters and teachers			2
but a couple of years ago , i started getting a lot of submissions from parents , many of whom have parent friends that they find annoying			1
more often than not , the person does know the " offending " parent and has been pushed to the edge			2
if a submitter says , " this person never usually overshares , " i 'll take that into consideration and might not run the submission			2
but most of the time , that 's not the case			2
once a poop picture oversharer , always a poop picture oversharer			2
@entity0 : what are some common types of overshare ? @entity5 : the aforementioned poop pictures are probably the most common type of submission i receive			1
i have categories within subcategories because i get so many submissions about poop and potty training			1
but aside from that , i consider " overshare " anything a person probably should have kept to herself			2
this can include hostile complaints about the @entity126 man waking the baby ( @entity128 is @entity129 ) , self - righteous updates about being a " supermom " ( @entity132 ) and hijacking a friend 's status update to talk about your baby in the comments ( @entity138 )			0
i also get a lot of graphic labor and delivery pictorials			0
some people have no filter			0
@entity0 : do parents ever share their own overshares ? @entity5 : i get e-mails from parents who say they 're " reformed " and submit old examples of their oversharing ways			1
i 've also heard from parents who say they read the blog because it makes them feel better about their own parenting ! @entity0 : how do you tread the line between being antagonistic to parents and just highlighting when they go too far ? @entity5 : to me , humor is n't good if it 's hateful			1
the trends i highlight are inherently ridiculous , and i try to emphasize the difference between sharing and oversharing			1
if you 're just posting a cute picture of your kid eating ice cream , it wo n't get featured on @entity17 , @entity20			0
@entity0 : do you ever get backlash against your posts from parents ? @entity5 : if there 's a backlash , it 's not really from parents			1
it 's more general , like people who just disagree with the blog 's existence			0
the mom blogger community has unleashed some fury against me and the site , but even in those cases , i think it was just one segment of that community			1
i 've rarely received hate mail , fortunately , and i get a lot of nice e-mails from parents			2
one parent did send me a death threat , though			0
it involved killing me with a piano			0
@entity0 : do you think social media has created a whole new breed of oversharing or just provided more immediate access to it ? @entity5 : social media is the gateway drug to oversharing			1
give people a @entity38 or @entity205 account and tell them to post whatever they want , and soon you will see a total devolution of acceptability			0
after all , you 're behind a computer or on your phone , and you 're almost tricked into thinking that what you post can simply be erased later			0
but in reality , once you post something online , it 's there forever			0
@entity0 : some of the blog 's content has to do with sharing potty training pictures			1
what 's the most disgusting example of oversharing that you 've been sent ? @entity5 : that answer depends on the person , because some people do n't find poop disgusting but are completely repulsed by vomit or long strands of green snot			1
you name it , i 've seen it			0
bloody noses , diaper blowouts , crowning newborns , and i 'm slightly embarrassed to admit that i have a whole folder dedicated to " finger - painting with poop " submissions			0
some people will even make art prints with their placentas to frame and hang in their homes			0
it 's all pretty gross			0
@entity0 : what does the book offer that the blog does n't ? @entity5 : the book is broken out into 34 short chapters that each represent a different category			1
it 's like a funny field guide to parent overshare , and i think it 'll be an essential baby shower gift			0
it also includes a glossary of words you might encounter in modern parenting culture ( like birth art , dipe and @entity262 ) , and there are helpful pointers , lists and a quiz to help you determine if you overshare			0
the blog is great for random doses of laughter , but the book is a cohesive guide that can be used like a " what not to share " manual			0
@entity0 : do you think your perspective or tone will change if you choose to become a parent ? @entity5 : there are two kinds of people on social media : those who post too much information and those who do n't			1
the ones who do are n't in the habit of considering their " audience " when they post			0
they just see social media as a digital scrapbook of their lives			1
i see it as a way to connect and share relevant information , and i do n't think a child 's poop texture is of any relevance to people other than a child 's parents			2
i also think there 's a difference between crowdsourcing the best type of car seat to buy and crowdsourcing an toddler 's mysterious , full - body rash			0
@entity0 : many people baby their pets			0
do you have any plans to start a stfu , @entity314 site ? i 've been collecting pet examples for over three years , and i can report that " pet parents " can be just as bad as human parents			2
some people even take pictures of their pet 's poop			0
none of it makes sense to me , and i 'm excited to share my confusion with readers			0
for instance , i recently received a series of submissions about a " dog mom " who celebrated her dog 's birthday and documented the whole shebang on @entity38 , " tagging " him in every photo			0
that kind of stuff deserves to be seen			0
follow @entity5 on @entity205 @ stfuparents			1

submitters are often friends of the oversharers , says blogger @entity5
she says potty training photos are among the worst offenders
some parents have reformed their ways , @entity5 notes
@entity5 : social media is the gateway drug to oversharing
