@entity0 -- police arrested more than a hundred protesters during an anti-war demonstration outside the @entity6 fence thursday			1
the event was part of a rally that also was in support of @entity12 founder @entity11 , whose website has revealed secret @entity15 documents about @entity16 , @entity17 and other countries			1
" this lynch mob mentality is @entity15 at its lowest , " said @entity19 , a former military analyst who , a generation ago , leaked the " @entity22 " to the @entity21			1
@entity19 , now 79 , told reporters this would be his 80th arrest for civil disobedience in the time since his revelations helped shed light on how badly the war in @entity32 was going for the @entity15			2
after a noisy but peaceful demonstration involving a few hundred people , police ordered the group to disperse			0
those who refused were then placed in plastic handcuffs , led to a processing tent during a snow shower , photographed and placed on a bus for transport			0
police continued to clear the demonstrators nearly two hours later			0
@entity15 @entity44 spokesman sgt. @entity46 later told @entity1 a total of 131 people were arrested and charged with failure to comply with a police order			0
most , if not all , were expected to admit guilt , pay a $ 100 fine and be released			0
before the protest began in nearby @entity54 , @entity19 held a news conference with an @entity57 group that had placed a full - page ad in the @entity21 calling for fair treatment of @entity11 as he fights potential legal action as publisher of secret materials his website received			1
the activist group @entity64 said nearly 95,000 of his countrymen have signed a statement of support for him and for the concepts of free speech and presumption of innocence			0
@entity19 said there are parallels in the @entity12 case with what he went though in 1971 when he supplied the @entity21 with details of a top - secret @entity79 study of @entity15 decision - making during the @entity81			1
he said of the latest leaks , " i regard it as a very admirable act , " and added he believes the person who supplied the information to @entity12 acted out of the same obligation " to inform the @entity15 people			1
" and where the @entity90 administration had the @entity21 as a clear target for the @entity22 , he said the " effort now is to distinguish @entity12 from the establishment press in order to prosecute			1
" he called that effort " a fool 's mission , " since @entity11 is a digital publisher			0
the right of the @entity21 to publish the @entity22 was eventually upheld by the @entity15 @entity101			2
" when i revealed the @entity22 , i thought at most there was a very small chance that it might have an effect on the war , just as sure @entity106 did n't have any guarantee what he 's doing would have any effect , but he was ready to go to prison for life to have some small chance of doing it , " @entity19 said			1
@entity106 , a @entity115 private first class , is a suspect in the @entity12 disclosures			2
he is awaiting trial in a @entity119 stockade in connection with earlier @entity12 revelations he is accused of involvement with			2
he has not admitted guilt in either incident , his supporters say .			0

the anti-war protest also was a rally in support of @entity12
@entity19 , of " @entity22 " fame , was among those arrested
@entity19 says he regards the latest leaks " as a very admirable act "
