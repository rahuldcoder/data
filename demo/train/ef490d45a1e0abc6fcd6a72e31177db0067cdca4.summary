@entity0 -- president @entity2 has signed a law that specifically bans so - called " crush videos " -- depictions of small animals being tortured to death by humans			1
the legislation came in response to a @entity12 ruling this year striking down a broader congressional law dealing with animal cruelty			1
the @entity15 criminalizes the creation , sale , and marketing of these specific kinds of videos , which lawmakers had labeled as " obscene			1
" penalties of up to seven years in prison would be possible			0
the videos mostly depict women -- with their faces unseen -- stomping helpless animals such as rabbits to death with spiked - heel shoes or with their bare feet			0
the videos apparently satisfy a sexual fetish for those who produce and watch them , said animal rights activists who supported the new bill			2
" by cracking down on the creation and distribution of crush videos , this bipartisan law effectively protects both animals and free speech , " said sen. @entity38 , @entity39 , one of the co-sponsors of the bill			1
sens. @entity48 , @entity49 , and @entity50 , @entity51 , also helped draft the legislation			0
supporters said the high court ruling opened the door for @entity56 to craft a " narrowly tailored " bill aimed at banning this specific type of commercial activity			0
" we are thankful that countless animals will now be spared from intentional torture for sick entertainment and profit , " said @entity60 of the @entity61 , which has worked for years to stop the mostly underground activity			0
the justices by an 8 - 1 margin struck down a broader 1999 federal law designed to stop the sale and marketing of videos showing dogfighting and other acts of animal cruelty , saying it was an unconstitutional violation of free speech			1
that specific case dealt with a @entity80 man who sold videos of dogs fighting each other at an overseas location			2
but the lone dissenter , justice @entity86 focused his attention on crush videos			1
" the animals used in crush videos are living creatures that experience excruciating pain			1
our society has long banned such cruelty , " he said			0
the courts , he said , have " erred in second - guessing the legislative judgment about the importance of preventing cruelty to animals			0
" alito at the time predicted mores crush videos would soon flood the underground market , because the ruling has " the practical effect of legalizing the sale of such videos			1
" lawmakers had promised to craft bills banning those types of videos			2
it was unclear if further legal challenges would result , following the president signing it into law			2
when it came to dog - fighting videos , " @entity119 itself reflects a judgment by the @entity123 people that the benefits of its restrictions on the government outweigh its costs , " said chief justice @entity118			1
he concluded @entity56 had not sufficiently shown " depictions " of dogfighting were enough to justify a special category of exclusion from free speech protection			0
nearly every state and local jurisdiction have their own laws banning mistreatment of wild and domesticated animals , and usually handle prosecutions several media organizations had supported @entity143 -- the man behind the dogfighting videos -- worrying the federal law could implicate reports about deer hunting , and depictions of bullfighting in @entity151 novels			1
@entity143 has defended his dogfighting videos as educational in nature , and has said the confrontations themselves did not violate any state laws since they were taped overseas			2
the @entity157 , other animal rights groups , and 26 states backed the government 's original high court challenge appeal			0
if that 11 - year - old law had been upheld , it would have been only the second time the @entity12 had identified a form of speech undeserving of protection by the @entity119			2
the justices in 1982 banned the distribution of child pornography			0
there was no immediate criticism of the president 's action , but even this new more narrowly written law may face future legal challenges			0
the crush videos do not specifically depict a sexual act , and so there may be questions over whether the videos are in fact " obscene , " at least by traditional legal and social standards			1
the justices are currently considering a separate case dealing with so - called " violent " video games , and a @entity187 law that would ban the sale of such material to minors			1
the high court is being asked to treat violent material -- as defined by the state -- the same as obscene material , when imposing restrictions on their sale .			0
