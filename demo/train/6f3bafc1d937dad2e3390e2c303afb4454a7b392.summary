the " @entity7 " was a whaling ship used during the @entity1 of the 1800s and then run aground to be used for storage and as a hotel in a place now known as @entity6			2
as the city grew and changed , the ship was built over and around many times , becoming part of the foundation of the city and now residing , at least in part , in the @entity15			2
a group at @entity17 has adopted that ship 's name , with the goal of crafting apps that encourage users to explore the world around them and , in the process , discover such hidden gems			1
the idea , according to @entity26 , vice president of product development for @entity27 , was to get people moving , exploring , and having fun during the normally stationary act of playing on their phones			1
" the theme of the group was the things around you that just lie beneath the surface , the unseen world , " @entity26 said			1
" the information exists on the @entity39 , but these are probably things you do n't notice in the real world			1
the information , although it is there , is often difficult to get to			2
" @entity27 has been working on two apps -- " @entity47 " and " @entity48			1
" " @entity47 " links 130 different information sources to your smartphone 's gps , resulting in alerts to interesting things currently around you			1
the app , which is available for @entity57 and @entity59 phones , has been out for about a year , but is now available for use with @entity61 as well			2
the advantage of @entity61 , @entity26 said , is that it lets users walk around , hands - free and experience things in a new way			1
" the idea ( with @entity61 integration ) is that the information can get to you in a way that is n't disruptive with what you are doing , " he said			2
" you can still interact with the people around you ; you can glance up and see it ; you can have it read to you			2
but you have that awareness of ' this is what that place is , this is what used to be here			0
' " during a demonstration in @entity86 , the app alerted me to nearby restaurants in the @entity61 display			0
i could choose to ignore them or go deeper into the information without pulling out a phone or bothering the people around me			0
in another example , the background and history on an unusual building popped up and could be read to me as i studied the building			0
" you 're not lost in your phone			0
you can get ( the information ) read in your ear			0
you now know that information and you can do with it whatever you want , " @entity26 said			0
" it 's kind of like having a smart local ( person ) walking beside you telling you where everything is			0
" if " @entity47 " is meant to be a helpful app for a leisurely stroll , " @entity48 " offers something else entirely : a competitive , worldwide game for the @entity59 phone where the enemy could be the person next to you on any given street corner			1
while encouraging fierce competition , " @entity48 " has organically evolved during its beta run into an app that brings people together socially and creates connections between players beyond the game			1
recently , @entity17 has been touring the world for an in - game event called @entity128			1
the goal of the game , according to the elaborate , sci - fi inspired story @entity7 has crafted for " @entity48 , " is for groups representing the two warring factions -- the @entity133 -- to create virtual fields that blanket an area and control the people therein			1
virtual hot - spots , called " portals " in the game , appear at the gps locations of real landmarks like public art , historic buildings , museums , local institutions and churches			1
players must be in the real - world location of these portals to " capture " them for their team			0
@entity26 said his original plan was to create an @entity152 ( massively multiplayer online ) game where people all over the world could play in their own time toward a common goal			1
but when people started gathering in cities to capture portals , he says , something amazing happened			0
" getting together in the real world , people are going out and playing for an hour -- or sometimes all night -- and then having beers or breakfast together , " he said			0
" people are doing that ; i never expected them to when i designed this game			1
" in " @entity48 , " there is always competition on a local level , as well as the occasional special event , with a specific , time - sensitive goal , that can draw dozens of players from both factions			1
recently , @entity17 has been hopping from city to city for major gatherings , though , drawing player numbers in the hundreds			1
@entity182 , @entity183 ; @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity86 , and @entity187 and @entity188 in @entity189 , have all been the sites of such events			0
@entity192 , one of the main organizers in @entity86 , said that while she is n't normally a competitive person , the social aspects of the game make it fun			1
" you have so many different socio - economical backgrounds in the players and we 've all become dearest friends , " @entity198 said			0
" you really ca n't do it alone			0
you have to work with other people and we 've all become good friends , no matter what side you 're on			0
" @entity209 , a tech researcher for the @entity211 @entity210 , said the game is addictive , but not so much that she wo n't invite everyone , even opponents , out for brunch afterward			1
" you 're meeting strangers and you 're sharing a bond when we 're playing , " @entity209 said			0
" it grows and you start hanging out even when you are n't playing			0
" the launch video for the game nearly six months ago showed two people eyeing each other warily at a portal , wondering which side the other was on			2
@entity26 said he expected some of that to happen , but what he did n't expect was for those people to actually start talking to each other			0
said @entity26 : " on social media , and even in the real world , people started doing that and walking up to other people and saying , ' you 're playing ' @entity48 , ' are n't you ? ' " " then these local clubs began to form and they started sending us pictures of their meet - ups			1
we started planning these events around that organic phenomenon			0
" one player described hanging out with other players from both sides as " friend - ponents , not frienemies			2
" " there is a rivalry , but there is also a camaraderie , " said @entity248			0
" there is a feeling of being together when you are doing something as a team			0
i found i was going to see exhibits around @entity86 just because of ' @entity48			1
' " the @entity59 - only game is still in closed beta and by invitation only , but @entity26 said his team is handing out invitations as quickly as they get requests			2
he thinks the game will be ready soon to be opened to players everywhere and hopes the hive mind , collective intelligence of the world will enjoy solving his puzzles			2
" people were sending us videos of players trudging through the snow ( in @entity277 ) playing ' @entity48 , ' " he said			1
" that blew our minds people were doing that			0

@entity17 lab works on apps that help users discover interesting things
@entity27 has created travel adviser " @entity47 " and *mobile* game " @entity48 "
" @entity47 " uses @entity291 to point out interesting things you are near
@entity48 uses public landmarks in a worldwide game between two sides
