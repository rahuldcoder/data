@entity0 -- a leather - faced @entity3 fruit seller said it best : " the revolution was like a beautiful woman			1
she charmed us , and we fell in love with her and killed the tyrant to marry her , but she was just a trick -- another burden to add to our heavy load , and we are falling out of love			2
" strolling through the streets of my native @entity0 for the first time in four years , i can see the heartbreak on every face			2
from the lines at gas stations to the crowds at public metros , every @entity3 looks exhausted and disappointed			1
@entity25 , the epicenter of revolt last year , now looks miserable , too			1
the icon of defiance has been reduced to just a bare patch of dry sand with a few dilapidated tents			2
as one driver told me , " if you want drugs , hashish or to hire a thug , go to @entity25			0
" the legacy of the revolution now lives in the streets , where a lack of security means many women feel less safe and are less likely to leave their homes by themselves after dark			0
it lives in the abandoned tourist sites and four - star hotels , where managers with only 20 % occupancy rates struggle to stay afloat amid numerous worker strikes and an uncertain economic climate			0
it lives in the cafes , where youngsters angrily dismiss our cameras , tired of the spotlight , irritated with the attention and seemingly embarrassed with the revolution that was once a point of pride			0
@entity0 is both familiar and unrecognizable since my visit to the city in 2008 when my grandmother demanded i destroy a pamphlet on workers ' rights out of fear the @entity3 authorities might harass me			1
this time , before i can even finish asking a question about elections , my family erupts into a furious debate , each member siding with a different candidate and attacking each other for supporting " fellul " -- or remnants of the old regime			0
no one , however , seems certain of their loyalties to any particular candidate , and even the weakest of arguments or the strangest of rumors can shift public opinion overnight			1
in a park in the posh neighborhood of @entity92 , activist @entity89 asks a ticket seller , " who will you vote for ? " the middle - aged man replies , " @entity97 , " a presidential candidate and former prime minister in the dying days of @entity101 's regime			1
unhappy with the answer , @entity89 tells him to vote for moderate @entity104 candidate @entity103			0
" if you really thinks he is better , then i will vote for him , " the ticket seller responds			0
@entity3 's fickle voters repeat the scenario every day in buses and offices			1
so each morning , it seems residents have chosen a different president -- only to abandon him the next day			0
this has left analysts and citizens alike without any clear expectation of who will win @entity3 's first - ever free elections			1
read more about @entity3 's historic presidential elections @entity3 's indecision lies in its limited range of candidates , essentially leaving constituents with frontrunners who are either former members of @entity101 's regime or @entity104			1
" it 's like all these years we have had these soccer players sitting on the sidelines , and now that we see them in the field playing we can see all their weaknesses and failures , " one student at a downtown cafe said			2
the country of 81 million seems so distracted with who has the soccer ball , many seem completely unaware of what or where the ultimate goal for @entity3 's future stands			1
the day @entity101 stepped down in february 2011 , i cried in the @entity1 newsroom , feeling for the first time ever that my people -- crippled by 30 years of dictatorship -- could not just walk but actually run towards freedom			0
but some @entity3 have lowered their expectations , moving from the revolutionary chant of " bread , freedom and social justice " to the murmured remark , " just let us live			1
" the revolutionary movement -- splintered and fragmented under the pressure of rebuilding the country -- failed to create a unified coalition or a clear post-revolution strategy			1
" i know the revolutionaries are hated right now			0
the country is blaming us for everything , and at the same time we have seen so much blood we feel conflicted about calling upon people to demonstrate , " protester and blogger @entity164 said			2
some @entity3 say the situation has deteriorated			1
" everything is worse ! the price of everything has increased			0
people ca n't make a living			0
the situation is awful , and the hardships are greater , " one woman said at a @entity0 metro			2
the @entity181 , the target of many demonstrators ' rage , has pledged to hand over executive power to a civilian president by the end of june , completing the transition to a freely elected government almost 16 months after the revolution started			0
far from the headscarves and @entity196 beards dominating @entity0 's streets , female protesters in jeans and free - flowing hair said the revolution is ongoing , but admitted the downfall of @entity101 's regime had yet to accomplish much for @entity3			1
the military stole the revolution , and we are struggling to win it back , " said @entity202 , a member of the group @entity203 for @entity204			0
" but we will continue fighting and continue to struggle against the regime until every last corner of the country is liberated			2

a year after @entity3 's revolt , many are disappointed with the situation in the country
some voters have been shifting *allegiances* to different presidential candidates
@entity222 : the revolutionary movement failed to create a clear post-revolution strategy
" nothing changes overnight , " one activist says
