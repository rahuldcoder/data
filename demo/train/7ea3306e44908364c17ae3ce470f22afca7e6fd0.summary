@entity0 , @entity1 -- threats of another perilous outbreak of tornadoes appeared to fizzle sunday , a day after powerful storms tied to the same weather system tore through the @entity9 and @entity10 states			1
the @entity11 had issued widespread tornado watches for several states including @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			1
and several big cities -- including @entity20 , @entity21 ; @entity22 , @entity16 ; and @entity23 and @entity24 in @entity14 -- were thought to be in the line of another stream of powerful storms			1
yet while people in many of those areas experienced inclement weather and a handful of tornadoes were reported in several states , the impact paled compared to what others had experienced saturday and into the early morning hours of sunday			1
survivors in hard - hit @entity1 town : ' we are truly blessed ' as of 10 p.m. ct , the service 's @entity40 had received 10 reports of tornadoes on sunday			1
most of those were from mid-day -- the latest being a reported touchdown at 5:30 p.m. ( 6:30 p.m. et ) in @entity48 in @entity14 -- but there was no immediate word of any significant damage during the day and night sunday , especially in more populated located			1
the numbers of reported twisters were well below the 122 that the weather service said happened saturday			1
