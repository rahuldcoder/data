tuesday saw @entity6 president @entity5 announce the annexation of @entity8 , two days after voters in that semiautonomous territory approved a hastily called referendum on separating from @entity12			1
@entity5 told a joint session of @entity6 's @entity14 that the nearly 97 % of @entity8 residents who voted to join @entity6 over the weekend was " an extremely convincing figure			1
" " in our hearts , we know @entity8 has always been an inalienable part of @entity6 , " he said			1
@entity12 prime minister @entity21 called it " a robbery on an international scale , " one that @entity3 will never accept			2
" one country has come and temporarily stolen part of of the territory of an independent country , " he said			0
" it will be difficult to find a quick resolution to this problem , but @entity6 is now isolated by the whole international community			2
" and after a member of its military was killed , another wounded and more captured when masked gunmen seized their base near the @entity8 regional capital , @entity4 , @entity12 's defense ministry authorized its forces to open fire			1
@entity21 warned that the crisis was shifting " from political to the military form , and the blame is on the @entity6 military			0
" @entity8 , which has an ethnic @entity6 majority , has long been a semiautonomous region within @entity12			1
it has had its own @entity14 , but the @entity12 government had veto power over its actions			0
after the revolt that forced @entity53 president @entity52 from office in february , @entity6 troops poured into the @entity8 , effectively cutting it off in support of a @entity53 government that took power in @entity4			1
@entity5 said tuesday that @entity6 had to act as @entity12 's new government , backed by the @entity60 and @entity62 powers , prepared " to seize the state through terror and murders			1
" " the main executors of this were nationalists , @entity6 - phobes and anti-semites , " he said			0
" those people define what is happening today in @entity12			0
" but international observers have said @entity2 saw its chance to annex a strategic territory , one that was transferred to @entity12 in the @entity77 era and which still hosts the home port of @entity6 's @entity79			1
@entity12 's interim president , @entity80 , told reporters that @entity5 is " mimicking the fascists of the last century " by annexing @entity8			1
" the political leadership of @entity6 will have to answer before the whole world for crimes they are committing today in our country , " @entity80 said			0
@entity89 : annexation sends ' a chilling message ' @entity5 declared tuesday that " we have not used our armed forces in @entity8 , " despite what has been stated by international observers and the government of @entity3			1
he said the 22,000 @entity6 troops in @entity8 did not enter during the current crisis , but " were already there , " in accordance with previous international negotiations			1
@entity6 forces were allowed in @entity8 under a treaty that allowed the @entity79 to be based there , but the movements of its forces within @entity8 are supposed to be agreed upon with @entity3			1
@entity5 praised those forces for avoiding bloodshed , but the tensions appear to have boiled over into violence tuesday			2
masked gunmen killed a member of @entity12 's military , wounded another and arrested the remaining staff of @entity12 's military topographic and navigation directorate at @entity4 , @entity111 spokesman @entity110 told @entity0			0
after that , the @entity111 authorized its forces in @entity8 to use weapons " to protect and preserve the life of @entity12 soldiers , " according to a statement posted on its website			1
@entity125 , a @entity12 member of @entity14 and former foreign minister , said tuesday that his country stands at " the beginning of a very dangerous conflict , and we should do our best to stop this process			1
" " several weeks ago , we had a guarantee that nothing [ would ] happen with the @entity8			0
several weeks ago we had [ a situation ] that there is not any military presence on @entity12 territory , including the @entity8 , " he told @entity0 's " @entity135 " program			1
now , he said , " i strongly believe that this is not only @entity12 territory is now threatened			0
" " now under attack can be any country in the @entity146 , including other parts of @entity12 , " said @entity125 , a billionaire and leading potential candidate for president			0
" that 's why we should think that it can never happen again			0
" @entity60 and @entity146 officials imposed sanctions on more than two dozen @entity6 and @entity8 officials monday and have urged @entity6 to avoid escalating the crisis , but @entity2 has ignored those calls			1
tuesday 's annexation brought a new round of condemnation from the @entity158 , with @entity159 prime minister @entity89 saying it sends " a chilling message across the continent of @entity162			0
" " it is completely unacceptable for @entity6 to use force to change borders , on the basis of a sham referendum held at the barrel of a @entity6 gun , " @entity89 said in a statement issued by @entity164			2
" president @entity5 should be in no doubt that @entity6 will face more serious consequences , and i will push @entity62 leaders to agree further @entity146 measures when we meet on thursday			1
" @entity6 faces ' more than just sanctions , ' @entity178 says the @entity181 group of industrialized nations had already suspended preparations for a planned @entity184 in the @entity6 city of @entity186			2
now , @entity60 president @entity189 has invited his counterparts from the other @entity181 countries and the @entity146 to a meeting of next week on the margins of a nuclear security summit in @entity195 , @entity188 spokeswoman @entity187 said			0
the planned meeting comes amid speculation that @entity6 will get kicked out of the @entity184 -- which comprises the @entity181 countries plus @entity6 -- because of its actions in @entity8			1
in @entity201 , @entity60 secretary of state @entity200 criticized " this rise of a kind of nationalism that is exercised unilaterally , to the exclusion of the international legal process			0
" " that 's what we have worked hard to avoid ever since @entity210 , " @entity200 said			0
he acknowledged that @entity6 has interests in @entity8 and " an enormous historical connection to @entity12 , " but said he was " really struck and somewhat surprised and even disappointed " by @entity5 's case for annexing the territory			1
" with all due respect , it just did n't ( jibe ) with reality or what 's happening on the ground , " @entity200 said			0
" the president may have his version of history , but i believe that he and @entity6 , for what they have done , are on the wrong side of history			1
" @entity228 chancellor @entity227 has said the " so - called referendum " and the acceptance of @entity8 to the @entity6 " goes against international law , " while @entity233 foreign minister @entity232 and a @entity233 delegation have postponed a planned visit to @entity2 because of the @entity12 situation , the @entity226 said			1
and @entity60 vice president @entity178 , dispatched to reassure @entity239 allies in @entity162 , said @entity6 faces " more than just sanctions " unless it abandons its " land grab " in @entity8			1
" we 're talking about @entity6 putting itself on a path that undermines long - term confidence and creates obstacles for its full participation in the global economy , " @entity178 said after talks in @entity244 's capital , @entity245			0
" that path that they 've placed themselves on does nothing to help the next generation of @entity6 compete and succeed in a world that will be led by the most dynamic and open economies			0
" condemnation abroad , cheers at home but lawmakers in @entity2 met @entity5 's address with regular and enthusiastic applause			0
the @entity6 leader accused the @entity158 of " double standards " and cynicism in its response to the @entity8 crisis , citing @entity269 -- which split from @entity6 's historical ally @entity271 over fierce objections from @entity273 -- as a precedent			2
" it 's absolutely in favor of their own interests -- black today , white tomorrow , " he said			0
@entity6 's @entity14 is expected to vote on ratifying @entity8 's accession to the @entity6 by the end of the week			2
the speaker of @entity6 's upper house of @entity14 , @entity283 , told state - run @entity6 - @entity284 that the process of adding a new member to the @entity6 " can be done rather promptly			0
" and hours after the annexation announcement , @entity5 appeared at a huge celebration on @entity289 organized by his supporters -- a sign of his widespread popularity at home			2
an opinion poll by the @entity2 - based @entity295 puts his approval rating at 72 % -- the highest in more than three years , and the second - highest point of his presidency			0
the highest point came in 2008 , during @entity6 's conflict with @entity301 , another former @entity77 republic			2
" @entity5 in many senses , on many levels , crystallizes the @entity6 national consciousness , " biographer @entity302 told @entity0			2
" for the past 100 years perhaps , we have never had a leader who would appeal to the @entity6 soul ... as much as @entity5			2
" most @entity6 and @entity309 feel @entity8 " is coming back home , " and a country that can produce " pretty much anything " has little fear of sanctions , he said			2
" it is absolutely not in the @entity60 interest to impose sanctions on @entity6 , because who will take @entity60 astronauts to space if not us @entity6 ? " @entity302 asked			0
@entity8 's vote : was it legal ? opinion : @entity189 ca n't have it both ways on @entity8 @entity158 's sanctions on @entity6 : are they just for show ? opinion : @entity5 wo n't stop at @entity8 @entity0 's @entity330 reported from @entity2 and @entity331 wrote in @entity332			1
@entity0 's @entity333 , @entity334 , @entity335 , @entity336 and @entity337 contributed to this report .			0
