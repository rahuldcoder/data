@entity0 -- two hours after first being notified of an attack on the @entity6 diplomatic mission in @entity7 , @entity8 , a government e-mail to the @entity10 , the @entity2 and the @entity3 said an @entity12 group had claimed credit , according to a copy obtained by @entity1			1
an initial e-mail was sent while the attack was still underway , and another that arrived two hours later -- sent from a @entity2 address to various government agencies including the executive office of the president -- identified @entity22 as claiming responsibility for the attack on its @entity26 page and on @entity27			1
the group denied responsibility the next day			1
however , the e-mails raise further questions about the seeming confusion on the part of the @entity34 administration to determine the nature of the september 11 attack that left @entity6 ambassador @entity37 and three other @entity6 dead			1
two @entity10 officials , speaking on condition of not being identified on wednesday , said the government e-mails about the attack were not an intelligence assessment			1
they also noted that there was conflicting information about @entity22 denying responsibility			1
read what @entity6 intel sees is an @entity49 in @entity51 link " they were a part of the many different reports we were receiving that day , " one of the @entity10 officials said of the e-mails			1
" there are always multiple and conflicting reports in the initial hours of an attack			1
that 's why you have an investigation			0
" secretary of state @entity64 advised reporters to wait until a review panel she appointed to investigate what happened completed its work			1
" @entity71 is already hard at work looking at everything , not cherry picking one story here or one document there but looking at everything , which i highly recommend as the appropriate approach to something as complex an attack like this , " @entity70 said wednesday			1
" you know , posting something on @entity26 is not in and of itself evidence			0
i think it just underscores how fluid the reporting was at the time and continued for some time to be , " @entity70 said			0
she repeated her earlier pledge to " take whatever measures are necessary to fix anything that needs to be fixed , and we will bring those to justice who committed these murders			0
" meanwhile , @entity10 spokesman @entity98 noted the e-mail about the claim of responsiblity " was an open - source , unclassified e-mail referring to an assertion made on a social media site that everyone in this room had access to and knew about instantaneously			1
" @entity98 added that " the whole point of an intelligence community and what they do is to assess strands of information and make judgments about what happened and who was responsible			2
" the day after the attack took place , president @entity34 referred to it as an " act of terror			1
" what the administration has said but in the following days , @entity98 maintained there was no evidence suggesting the attack was " planned or imminent			2
" in attack aftermath , disagreement over how it began the administration also suggested that an @entity132 video produced in the @entity6 likely fueled a spontaneous demonstration in @entity7 as it had in @entity134 , where the @entity6 @entity135 also was attacked			1
@entity70 , @entity2 spokeswoman @entity137 and @entity138 , @entity6 ambassador to the @entity139 , all cited the video as a motivating factor in the attack			1
on september 13 -- two days after the attack -- a senior @entity6 official told @entity1 that the violence in @entity8 was not the work of " an innocent mob			1
" " the video or 9/11 made a handy excuse and could be fortuitous from their perspective , but this was a clearly planned military - type attack , " the official said			0
however , it was n't until september 19 that @entity151 , the nation 's counterterrorism chief , told senators that it was a terrorist attack			2
the next day , @entity98 also said it was " self - evident that what happened in @entity7 was a terrorist attack			2
" the e-mails obtained by @entity1 provide additional insight into the @entity7 attack			0
the first one , sent at 4:05 p.m. et , or 10:05 p.m. in @entity8 , described a diplomatic mission under attack			0
" approximately 20 armed people fired shots ; explosions have been heard as well , " the e-mail said			0
@entity37 and four other mission staff were in the compound safe haven , it added			2
less than an hour later , at 4:54 p.m. et , another e-mail reported " firing at the @entity6 @entity135 in @entity7 has stopped and the compound has been cleared			2
" it said a search was underway for consulate personnel			0
the final e-mail , at 6:07 p.m. , noted the claim of responsibility for the attack			0
the subject line said : " update 2 : @entity182 for @entity183			0
" " @entity185 reports the group claimed responsibility on @entity26 and @entity27 and has called for an attack on @entity185 , " the e-mail said			1
the @entity26 claim of involvement was subsequently denied by the group at a news conference in the following days , but not very convincingly			0
" we are saluting our people for this zeal in protecting their religion , to grant victory to the prophet , " a spokesman for @entity22 said at the time			0
" the response has to be firm			0
" it is common for one or more claims of responsibility to follow high - profile attacks on @entity6 targets , and intelligence officials analyze them for validity before declaring any legitimate			2
for example , groups make false claims to seek publicity and raise their profile			0
analysts examine a group 's history , whether it made previous claims that were legitimate , whether it has the capacity to carry out such an attack , and whether known members of the group participated in the attack in assessing the validity of claims of responsibility			2
@entity1 's @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227 and @entity228 contributed to this report			0
