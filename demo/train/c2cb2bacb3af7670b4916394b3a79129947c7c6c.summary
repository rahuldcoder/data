-- few would argue that football is the planet 's true global game			1
from @entity5 to @entity6 it is watched , played , argued about , loved and hated with an intensity that no other sport can match			2
its ubiquity also brings a tremendous amount of power			2
dictators and politicians have long tried to harness its ability to inspire unity and national pride for more nefarious political purposes -- be it @entity22 's junta who used the 1978 @entity24 to inspire the kind of loyalty that its regime had failed to do , to current @entity29 president @entity28 , who feared and respected football 's power to spark change in equal measure			1
" [ @entity39 ] has caused at least one war and many battles , often tragic , off the pitch , " wrote @entity34 , nominating the @entity35 , the football 's first official code , in his " @entity38			1
" but sometimes a single match has been at the center of huge social and political changes			1
ahead of the start of the @entity47 , @entity0 gives you some of the games that changed the world			1
@entity51 versus president 's @entity52 ( 1864 ) when 22 men gathered in @entity55 , @entity56 , in the winter of 1864 for a game of football , no - one could imagine the worldwide sporting revolution that would follow			1
this was the first game played according to the @entity63 , written by the embryonic @entity64 and the first attempt to unite and codify football 's different , not to mention competing , strands			1
the forward pass had n't been introduced yet , there were no such thing as crossbars and the offside rule was still three years away from being introduced , but the @entity75 @entity74 need for imprimatur and order meant that the simplified , slimmed - down rules -- just 13 laws -- were easily exported			2
which the @entity75 did with a proselytizing zeal throughout its colonies and the rest of the world			1
one such football missionary was @entity86 , who in the mid- 1890s took a copy of the rules and a football to @entity89 , from where it caught on like wild fire			1
" a @entity89 taxi driver told me that @entity94 had invented football			1
in other words , he 's a legendary figure [ in @entity89 ] , but no - one is quite sure what the legend actually is , " explained @entity96 , author of " @entity98 is @entity89 , " a biography of @entity86			2
" in @entity105 , there is a square named after him			2
it 's the square outside the stadium where @entity110 play			2
" and the match itself ? the secretary 's @entity52 won 2 - 0 , with both goals scored by @entity115 , who would himself go on to organize the very first international fixture , between @entity118 and @entity119 , seven years later			2
@entity120 versus @entity121 ( 1954 ) post-war @entity120 was a haunted , broken and divided place			2
although it was devastated financially by the folly of @entity126 and the split between east and west by the emergence of the @entity130 , @entity123 were in a soul - searching funk over their role in the @entity133			2
the singing of the national anthem was actively discouraged and the country 's new , unloved flag was rarely seen			2
and then came the " @entity139 " at the 1954 @entity24 , held in @entity138			2
despite being trounced 8 - 3 in their first match against @entity121 , @entity120 made it to the final of the @entity24 to face the same opposition			2
the team was made up solely of amateur footballers , while @entity121 -- the best team in the world at the time -- boasted the likes of @entity151			1
no - one gave them a chance , but they won 3 - 2 , sparking scenes of jubilation back in @entity120 and the first positive , collective nationalistic outburst since the war			2
" it was a kind of liberation for the @entity123 from all the things that weighed down upon them after the @entity133 , " @entity123 historian @entity160 wrote			2
" july 4 , 1954 is in certain aspects the founding day of the @entity166			0
" from there @entity120 boomed economically , becoming the leading nation in @entity169			0
as newspaper @entity170 pointed out before a united @entity120 hosted the 2006 @entity24 : " in one 90 - minute match against @entity121 , modern - day @entity120 was born			0
" @entity172 versus @entity173 ( 1966 ) @entity174 is infamous for its most revered prisoner : @entity176			0
but the jail , which held what the apartheid @entity179 state viewed to be the most dangerous political prisoners , also gave birth to an unlikely football league			1
the @entity185 was set up by a group of prisoners desperate to break the monotony of prison life			0
every week from 1964 onwards a prisoner would ask for permission to play football , and then be punished by the authorities as a result of his temerity			1
but by 1966 the prison warden relented and a football league was set up based on one of the only books in the prison library : the @entity202 rule book			1
scores , leagues , disciplinary records and even the results of disciplinary hearings from on - pitch indiscretions were kept , although no record exists of the score between the @entity172 and @entity173 in the first - ever match			0
as well as giving the inmates hope during desperate times , the @entity212 had a more important impact : honing the administrative skills of @entity179 's future leaders			0
@entity218 , the current president , was a tough - tackling defender for the @entity173 and a future @entity212 referee			0
" it taught them administration ... @entity174 created the new generation of people that struggled for freedom , " explains professor @entity223 , author of " @entity224 : football vs. @entity230			1
" " and those men thought football was very important in maintaining their sanity and hope for the future			1
by definition , football is absolutely essential in the way the struggle for freedom is won			1
" the @entity212 , although long abandoned , was given honorary @entity202 membership in 2007			1
@entity241 versus @entity242 ( 1990 ) @entity243 was already on the brink of imploding by the time @entity246 's @entity242 played @entity247 's @entity241 at the latter 's @entity248			0
pro- independence parties had already won recent @entity252 elections			0
but the events that unfolded on march 13 , 1990 are regarded by many as the opening salvo of the most vicious @entity169 war since the @entity257 were defeated in 1945			0
during the match , future @entity259 and @entity247 captain @entity258 launched a kung - fu kick at a policeman who was attacking a @entity264 fan			0
riots broke out between @entity264 's " @entity268 " ultra group , and @entity242 's " @entity269 " -- led by the brutal war - lord @entity267			0
@entity267 's @entity270 's , the paramilitary group he ruled during the war , recruited heavily from the @entity269			0
@entity267 himself was indicted by the @entity274 for war crimes , but was assassinated in 2000 before he stood trial			0
later , @entity258 explained what was going through his head			0
" here i was , a public face prepared to risk his life , career and everything that fame could have brought , all because of one ideal cause : the @entity252 cause			0
" for the rest of the soon - to - be - non - existent country , it was a symbolic moment			0
" it was the most important match in @entity243 history , " explains dr. @entity289 , author of " @entity290 : the end of a @entity293			0
" " it has political implications and is a clear sign of the forthcoming violence and war that this unfinished match provided to the population			1
" the war went on to rage for five years , with the @entity302 estimating that 140,000 people were killed			0
its effects are still evident today , not least outside the @entity248 , where a statue depicting a group of soldiers stands			0
on it is the inscription : " to the fans of the club , who started the war with @entity246 at this ground on may 13 , 1990			0
" @entity315 versus @entity316 ( 2007 ) @entity317 ran the length of the pitch to celebrate with the handful of fans that had made the long journey to the vast , half - empty stand in @entity325 's @entity324			1
the captain of the @entity315 national team -- a team of @entity329 , @entity330 and @entity331 -- had just scored the only , decisive goal in the @entity334 final on july 29 against @entity316 , but it meant much more than the first piece of major silverware for the " @entity337			1
" back in @entity5 , tens of thousands of @entity315 poured into the streets , firing celebratory bullets into the air , with many clutching something that had not been seen in numbers since the fall of @entity344 : the @entity315 flag			1
football had achieved what no politician or general had managed to achieve : a semblance of national unity			1
according to the @entity354 military , there were 1,700 sectarian attacks in @entity5 alone in june 2007			1
that had almost halved after the final , to 960 by the end of august			0
but the victory came at a price			0
minutes after @entity315 had beaten @entity362 in a penalty shoot out in the semifinal , a suicide bomber blew himself up in a crowd of cheering fans , killing 50 people			1
at the @entity47 , the victorious team sat , stunned , in the dressing room and contemplated pulling out of the final			1
but then the players watched the carnage on television			0
" one of the victims was a 12 - year - old child , " recalled @entity317 to the press afterwards			0
" his mother , when his body was laid in front of her , she did n't weep , but she said : ' i present my son as a sacrifice for the @entity315 national team			1
' we have to win			0
" they chose to continue , and the rest is history .			0

the @entity47 kicked off in @entity389 earlier this month , with 16 teams taking part
the *holders* @entity315 *shocked* the world by winning in 2007 and violence there fell afterwards
