the historic six - month agreement over @entity2 's nuclear program may begin a new era of relations with @entity5 , but it will be a long road back for the country 's most vital sector , oil			1
@entity5 produces about two and half million barrels a day -- far off its 4 - million - barrel - per - day peak a decade ago			1
output is hovering at a level last seen at the end of @entity5 's war with @entity14			2
with @entity18 crude averaging over $ 100 a barrel for a record three years running , the sanctions on energy alone are costing @entity2 about $ 50 billion in lost annual revenue			1
despite the deal breakthrough , @entity22 secretary of state @entity21 said most of the sanctions will stick as the world gauges the intentions of this relatively new administration in @entity2			1
" during the six month phase , the oil sanctions that will remain in place will continue to cause over $ 25 billion in lost revenues to @entity5 or over $ 4 billion a month , " he said			1
the message is clear : the pressure remains , but if all goes well , in a half year 's time @entity5 can expect more in return for transparency			2
the last few years have been filled with uncertainty			0
tensions around the @entity39 with the on - and - off threats by the previous government of @entity42 to block oil shipments in the @entity44 have kept what strategists call a 10 - 15 % risk premium on global energy prices			2
@entity5 sits on about 9 % of the world 's proven oil reserves , claiming a few years back that it has nearly 150 billion barrels and the world 's largest gas field			1
but its top four customers -- @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 -- have all had to cut back their energy imports by a third or more in the past few years due to @entity22 and @entity61 pressure			0
with every year that has passed , the screws have been tightened by @entity64 and the countries of the @entity66			0
it was not only sanctions against oil , but also blocking @entity5 's ability to secure shipping insurance and to trade in @entity22 dollars and euros			1
that economic isolation , many @entity74 strategists i have spoken with suggest , is what brought @entity5 's new government to the negotiating table			2
in 2012 , the @entity5 rial plunged by up to 80 %			0
basic staples of life , poultry and bread skyrocketed in price and the economy went through a period of hyper - inflation			0
with rising import prices due to a plummeting currency , industrial @entity5 is no longer able to compete			0
there are reports that the state manufacturing sector had laid off up to 800,000 workers in 2012 and those who have kept their jobs saw their wages eroded by skyrocketing prices			0
oil executives with experience in the country say this initial agreement would help lift a cloud of uncertainty over the oil market , but that president @entity105 and his cabinet have to establish much better contract terms if this honeymoon period lifts sanctions			0
the blunt - speaking chief executive of @entity112 energy group @entity111 , @entity113 , told me at an energy conference in @entity116 this month that @entity5 needs to try and create a better climate for investment if this weekend 's breakthrough is sustained			1
" i can tell you with the experience we have from @entity5 it does n't always bring as we say in @entity112 partie de plaisir ... a win - win			0
" oil giant @entity125 has expressed doubts about signing a deal with @entity2 , which will introduce more challenges within @entity130			2
@entity14 plans to double production by 2020 to six million barrels a day and with @entity5 wanting to rebuild exports , the @entity133 may have trim its own production to defend prices			1
it is still early days , but this country of nearly 80 million people has been described as potentially being the @entity139 of the @entity74 with plenty of natural resources -- that is , if it can emerge from years of economic isolation .			0
