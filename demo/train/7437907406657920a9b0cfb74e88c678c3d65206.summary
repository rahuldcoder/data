-- president @entity1 on tuesday tried to draw a distinction between himself and @entity4 challenger @entity3 on contraceptives			1
he boasted that @entity1 's @entity6 gives insured women free contraception coverage , and said @entity3 thinks employers should decide whether women can get contraception through insurance			1
@entity1 made the statements at tuesday 's presidential debate in @entity15 , @entity16			0
@entity3 , who has said he wants to repeal the @entity6 and also takes issue with part of the contraceptive coverage rule , countered that @entity1 misrepresented his stance			1
the statements : @entity1 : " a major difference in this campaign is that gov. @entity3 feels comfortable having politicians in @entity25 decide the health care choices that women are making			1
i think that 's a mistake			0
in my health care bill , i said insurance companies need to provide contraceptive coverage to everybody who is insured			0
... gov. @entity3 not only opposed it , he suggested that in fact employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage			1
" fact check : @entity3 , women and jobs @entity3 : " i do n't believe that bureaucrats in @entity25 should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not , and i do n't believe employers should tell someone whether they can have contraceptive care or not			2
every woman in @entity51 should have access to contraceptives , and the president 's statement of my policy is completely and totally wrong			0
" the facts : to make sense of the statements , we should examine what the @entity6 's contraceptives rule does , and what @entity3 has said he objects to			0
the rule initially required most insurance plans to provide free contraception coverage to women			1
by august 2011 , the rule was amended to exempt certain religious employers , such as churches , synagogues and other houses of worship , from offering such coverage			2
but other religiously affiliated organizations , including colleges and hospitals , were not exempt , and religious groups objected			0
so , in february , the @entity1 administration announced what it called a compromise in which free contraception coverage still must be offered to employees of religiously affiliated colleges and hospitals , but health insurers -- rather than the employers -- would have to cover the cost			1
churches and other houses of worship retained the full exemption , meaning women who worked there had no guarantee of full contraception coverage			1
the requirement went into effect august 1 , though the non-exempt religiously affiliated institutions such as colleges and hospitals can have up to august 1 , 2013 , to comply			0
some conservatives and religious groups , including some affiliated with the @entity104 , continued to object , saying the rule still infringed on religious liberty and set a dangerous precedent by distinguishing between church and church - affiliated groups for conscience clauses			1
@entity3 has said he would repeal the @entity6 , which includes the contraceptives rule			0
he also opposes the contraceptives rule specifically			0
in august , his campaign released a tv ad accusing @entity1 of mounting a " war on religion , " saying that the health care law forces religious institutions to " go against their faith			2
" on february 10 , the day the @entity1 administration announced the compromise , @entity3 said the rule still was " an assault on religious conviction , " and suggesting that the insurance companies that would be forced to pay for contraception for employees of religiously affiliated colleges and hospitals could try to pass the cost on to the employers			1
around the same time , @entity3 said he supported a proposed amendment that would have allowed employers to opt out of providing health care coverage they disagreed with on moral grounds			2
the proposal , which was killed in the @entity138 in march , was @entity138 @entity4 ' response to the controversy over contraception and religious employers , though it did n't specifically mention contraception			0
the proposal stated that the health care act imposes requirements that infringe on the rights and conscience of insurers and plan sponsors , and it would have established that an entity refusing coverage on religious or moral grounds is not in violation of the law			0
conclusion : @entity1 's health care act does require most insurers to provide free contraception coverage to women , as described above			1
@entity3 , while not opposing the availability of contraception , opposes the contraception rule , arguing it forces some religious institutions to go against their faith			2
complete coverage of @entity0 's @entity167 @entity0 's @entity168 , @entity169 and @entity170 contributed to this report .			0
