-- you know the old saying -- if a deal is too good to be true , then it probably is too good to be true			0
that 's what happened to a major retailer 's online shoppers friday afternoon			0
@entity8 inadvertently advertised @entity10 's @entity9 for $ 69 , much less than the regular advertised price of $ 744.99			1
that low price got the attention of web shoppers and the deal went viral on @entity16 and other social media websites			0
many people took advantage of the unbelievable deal , though a @entity8 spokesperson could n't give an exact number			1
friday night , @entity8 posted a statement online telling customers the error was made by a third - party vendor and the deal will not be honored			1
" we want you to know that , unfortunately , today one of the @entity31 third party sellers told us that they mistakenly posted incorrect pricing information on two @entity10 @entity9 models on the @entity31 portion of the website			1
if you purchased either of these products recently , your order has been cancelled and your account will be credited , " the statement said			0
@entity40 of @entity41 , @entity42 , was one of the disappointed customers			0
her son has @entity46 's syndrome and relied heavily on his @entity9 for his schoolwork , until it was stolen a few months ago			2
so when @entity40 's friends told her about the great deal on @entity8 , she said she jumped on it			1
@entity40 said immediately after she paid for the @entity9 , she received e-mail confirmations from both @entity52 and @entity8			1
about six hours later , @entity8 sent her an e-mail to tell her that her order was canceled because of the mistake			1
" i shop online all the time and i 've never had anything like this happen , " @entity40 said			0
" they want to blame a third party , but the order confirmation e-mail i got was from @entity8			2
" " they are a huge company i thought i could trust and rely on , " @entity40 said			0
" but if they do n't honor this , i wo n't ever shop at @entity8 again			2
i just want my order honored			0
