-- this is @entity2 's last summer off			1
when school starts in august , it will be her last year to think about high school classes , advanced placement tests and calculus			1
if all goes as planned , this will be her last year teaching at @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11			1
she does n't want to go			1
after 13 years of teaching high - level math , she has a tested stable of learning methods that helped all her students pass the @entity17 calculus exam			1
her room is a popular place for students to escape the drama of the high school cafeteria			1
few jobs can indulge her excitement for linear functions and matrix calculus			1
" i hate to have to leave it , " @entity2 said			1
" i really thought i was going to be that teacher , 65 years old and retiring from the education field			1
that 's not going to happen			1
" she 's quitting , she said , because she ca n't afford to stay			2
two years ago , a divorce left 47 - year - old @entity2 with a single income			1
rental properties she owned only caused more financial strain as @entity11 's real estate market fell apart in recent years			2
despite her years of experience , she earns $ 38,000 , she said , less than she made in the past , when teachers received larger supplements for additional certifications			1
once she made a budget , she realized she did n't make enough money to cover her expenses and save for her future			1
changing careers felt like the only wise financial move , she said			2
@entity2 is n't the only one			1
attracting the best students to teaching -- and keeping them -- is tough for schools across the country			1
average starting teaching salaries are $ 39,000 , and rise with experience to an average of $ 54,000 , according to " closing the @entity55 , " a 2010 report by @entity57			1
teacher salaries ca n't compete with other careers , the report said , and annual teacher turnover in the @entity62 is 14 %			2
at " high - needs " high schools , it is 20 %			1
the @entity66 data from 2007 said the @entity62 ranks 20th out of 29 for starting teacher salaries , and 23rd out of 29 for teacher salaries after 15 years			2
but it 's not just the pay , @entity2 said , " it 's the way we 're treated			1
" her colleagues have waited until just before school starts to learn what courses they 'll be teaching , she said			1
uncertainty makes it impossible to prepare , hard to succeed			1
" five years ago , 10 years ago , kids would ask me , should they become teachers ? i was like , ' oh , @entity78 , yes , i love what i do , ' " she said			2
" now , i tell my kids , ' you 're really , really bright			2
why do n't you think about going into ( this or that ? ) ' they have the potential to be doctors , lawyers , nurses , @entity90 and scientists			2
why would i recommend to my kids , who i absolutely love , to struggle for years ? " this year , she 's finishing the prerequisite courses needed to enroll in nursing school			1
@entity2 hopes to spend a couple of more years learning , then work in emergency care nursing to gain experience			1
" it 's challenging , " she said , " but there 's not a whole lot that 's more challenging than doing upper level mathematics			2
" here 's what @entity2 had to say about her decision to leave teaching			1
@entity0 : why did you go into teaching ? @entity2 : when my son was 6 years old , the school system that he was in in @entity109 , it did not allow the teacher to take her planning days unless she could find a volunteer sub			1
she had to ask for parental volunteers			2
i told her at the beginning of the year , ' i work at night			1
i 'll take every single one of your days			2
i can substitute for you			2
' i really enjoyed working with the kids			2
then i read an article in the paper , and it said that ( most ) boys get the same educations as their mothers			2
i had not gone to college			2
i wanted my son to be college educated			2
it was time for me to go back to school			2
i knew that math was an area where i would never , ever worry about getting a job as a teacher			2
if you 're in math or physics or chemistry , you can write your own ticket			2
@entity0 : had you always been interested in math ? @entity2 : i was not a good student in high school			1
i really needed a teacher to take me under their wing and go " look , you have potential			2
" i did n't have that teacher			2
i missed a lot of school			0
you ca n't be good at math unless you are present to learn it			0
when i went back to school , my first math class was pre- pre-college math ... you did n't even get a grade for it , you just got pass or fail			0
i remember starting in negative numbers ; i never even knew negative numbers existed , except in my checking account			0
whatever i did learn in high school , i had forgotten			0
i was 29 years old			0
i had been out of school for 11 years			0
i had a teacher for developmental math named ms. @entity158 , and she was amazing			0
out of my entire career , she was the best math professor i ever had			1
i loved math. @entity0 : did that influence how you teach ? @entity2 : i did n't take ms. @entity158 for granted			1
the way she made it so elemental , and gave me that strong base to go ahead and succeed			0
what i have found is most people are n't awful at math , even if math is not your strength			0
you can be successful , given the right mentor			1
it definitely influenced the way i teach			0
i have always had a very open relationship with my students			1
i do n't believe i deserve respect because i 'm older			0
i deserve it because i 've earned it , and you deserve it because you 've earned it			0
the majority of the really , really amazing techniques i have came from students			1
i worked summers for years			0
i taught a six - week class where students could either remediate or jump ahead			1
you taught it for an eight - hour day			1
i had a young man , @entity192			0
he came up to me , " ms. @entity194 , we 're just learning and learning and learning			0
we 're just forgetting and forgetting and forgetting			0
we need to practice it			0
" i asked " what do you think we should do ? " he said , " i think we need to go to the boards			0
" every day , except on test days , my kids go to the board ( to work math problems in front of each other )			0
if they finish and they get it right , i give them a thumbs up and they go help another student			0
the best teaching technique i have -- it came from @entity192			1
@entity0 : why did you decide to leave teaching ? @entity2 : i have had to learn how to budget			1
in those thoughts , i came to the realization that the money i make is n't enough			0
it is n't enough to live alone			0
as educators , we make what we make , nothing more , nothing less			0
in industry , if i 'm valuable , my company can keep me by making the package they offer me more attractive			0
in education , the principal 's hands are tied			0
you just never know what the future holds			0
i still need to plan for the future			0
@entity0 : why did you choose nursing ? @entity2 : i 'm happiest when i feel like i 'm making a difference in another individual 's life			1
there are other things i could do			0
i could take actuarial exams			0
i could easily pass those ; it 's math. do i want to be an actuary , doing risk assessment for an insurance company with no human contact ? no , thank you			0
what 's really amazing is that nurses , with a two - year degree , make $ 20,000 more than i do			1
@entity0 : how did your students react when they learned this would be your last year teaching ? @entity2 : my students were the first ones to know			1
one student comes to mind : just the other day , he e-mailed and asked me to call him			0
he wanted to confirm again i would be there next year			1
the ones who were leaving , they do n't care			0
i 've already done for them what i needed to do			0
my juniors moving up to calculus , they were distraught			0
they know i know what i 'm doing			0
they know what it 's like to have a teacher who does n't know what they 're doing			0
they 've all had bad teachers			0
@entity0 : what do you hope your students take away from their time in your classes ? @entity2 : kids come into my classroom , and everyone thinks they 're all math geeks			1
i have so many kids who take my class because they want the calculus credit for college , but they 're not the kind of kid who could go to a college calculus class and meet with success			0
i want them to get a love not of mathematics , just knowledge , just learning			0
i want them to always remember how anything was possible .			0

after a successful 13 - year teaching career , @entity2 plans to quit .
she earns about $ 38,000 per year -- too little to cover expenses , she says
*nationally* , attracting the best students to teaching is hard because of low pay .
@entity2 plans to *pursue* nursing , which is likely to pay $ 20,000 more per year .
