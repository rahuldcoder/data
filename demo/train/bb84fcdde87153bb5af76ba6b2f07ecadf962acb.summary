-- a @entity2 couple never planned to turn their trip to @entity5 into a mission to help educate girls			1
but that 's exactly what happened			0
@entity10 and @entity11 had traveled to the @entity13 country often			1
during a 2002 visit , a taxi driver asked the @entity16 if they wanted to see " the children			1
" not really knowing what he meant , they agreed			0
the driver took them about 25 minutes outside the capital of @entity24			0
on their arrival , they saw hundreds of people on giant mountains of garbage			2
" there were flies everywhere , " @entity10 said			1
" there were snakes and rats and the stench ; you were just gagging			0
" his wife added , " i had to breathe through my mouth not to smell it			0
" but they said they were most shocked by all the young children going through the garbage			2
these kids were scavenging for metal , plastic , glass and anything else they could sell to a recycler to make money			1
each child would make about $ 10 a month at the dump to help out their families , @entity10 said			1
a photographer for @entity2 sports teams including the @entity56 and @entity57 , @entity10 started snapping pictures of the dump			1
but the experience haunted him and his wife			1
" we were just tourists , " he said			0
" but we thought we could help one person			0
" they came back the next day and decided to focus on a child to save from the dump			1
one girl stuck out in @entity11 's mind , she said			1
" i remember seeing this little girl with the red hat			0
and i do n't know if it was the red hat or it was her eyes ... these big eyes ( that ) ... just looked kind of hopeless			2
" through their driver , who spoke some @entity76 , they found out the girl 's name was @entity79			0
they drove her home to talk to her mother about a way to get the 10 - year - old out of the dump and into school			2
when they arrived , they met her sister @entity90 , 12 , and decided they would help them both			0
they made a deal with the girls ' mother			0
" we 're going to pay you whatever they would make at the dump , " @entity10 recalled telling the mother			1
" we 're going to make sure you have food at the table , and in exchange for this you have to promise us that you 'll make sure they go to school every day			0
you 'll make sure they stay in school , and you 'll make sure they never go to the dump again			0
" the mother agreed , and the @entity16 gave their trusted driver money to fund the plan for the girls for the next six months			1
the couple also found two other girls they decided to sponsor during their trip			1
returning home to @entity2 , the @entity16 showed their photos to friends and family and told them what they were doing with the girls			1
many decided they wanted to help , too , and gave the @entity16 money to fund more children			1
@entity10 also started doing fund - raisers with a slide show called " from the @entity128 to the @entity129			1
" he would show his photos of the sports teams he covered and then scenes of orphanages , landmine survivors and the children at the dump in @entity5			1
" by now , the whole room 's in tears , " @entity10 recalled			2
a newspaper wrote an article about what the @entity16 were doing , and soon they were getting donations from all over the country			2
they ended up starting a nonprofit organization called @entity146			1
today , the organization has two centers where they house about 100 girls and boys			2
and the concept is the same as it was from the start			0
the group pays the parents what their children would make at the dump in exchange for the kids going to school			2
and these efforts are paying off			0
today , the sisters the @entity16 initially helped are attending @entity163 in @entity2			1
@entity79 is studying hospitality , with hopes of working in the hotel and restaurant industry			0
@entity90 is studying @entity76 and wants to become a teacher			0
over the years , they became close to the @entity16 , spending a lot of time together traveling			2
@entity90 says she feels like they are her second family			0
without the @entity16 and an education , it 's hard to say where the two girls would be now			1
" education is really important to me personally , because i see it as a bridge , " @entity79 says , adding , " education to me is like a second life			0
