" so far , @entity6 armed forces have exercised restraint and refrained from active resistance to the aggression , but they are in full operational readiness , " @entity6 ambassador @entity19 said			2
as diplomats at the meeting asked @entity0 to withdraw its troops and called for mediation to end the crisis , @entity0 ambassador @entity25 insisted his country 's aims were preserving democracy , protecting millions of @entity0 in @entity6 and stopping radical extremists			1

" " people are being persecuted for language and political reasons , " the letter said			0
" so in this regard , i would call on the president of @entity0 , mr. @entity50 , asking him to use the @entity51 to establish legitimacy , peace , law and order , stability and defending the people of @entity6			1
" @entity59 ambassador @entity58 said @entity0 's claims about the situation in @entity6 are untrue and warned that sending military forces " could be devastating			1
" @entity35 , she said , abandoned his post last month and was then voted out of office by @entity6 's democratically elected parliament			1
" @entity0 military action is not a human rights protection mission , " @entity58 said			2

what they planned to do next remained unclear			0
analysts told @entity96 the apparently growing presence of @entity0 troops in @entity17 means there 's a risk the tense standoff could escalate			1
" there are lots of unintended consequences when you have armed men staring at each other in places like you do in @entity17 , " said @entity102 , the former @entity59 ambassador to @entity0			1

" @entity50 's moves into @entity6 come as the @entity0 leader struggles to deal with a political crisis in the neighboring country that did n't unfold as his government hoped , according to @entity0 analyst @entity123 , formerly @entity96 's @entity125 bureau chief			1
" @entity50 has been trying to figure out what to do			0
so now he 's taking these steps , " @entity123 said			0
" and i think that he probably thinks that they 're carefully calibrated			0
but he really is playing with fire			0
" in one ominous incident , a @entity131 spokesman said the commander of @entity0 's @entity135 fleet boarded a blocked @entity6 warship and issued a threat			1

... there are no grounds for the use of force against civilians and @entity6 , and for the entry of the @entity0 military contingent , " he said			1
" @entity0 never had any grounds and never will			0

how is the rest of the world reacting ? east vs. @entity236 @entity6 , a nation of 45 million people sandwiched between @entity80 and @entity0 's southwestern border , has been in chaos since @entity35 was ousted on february 22 after bloody street protests that left dozens dead and hundreds wounded			1
anti-government demonstrations started in late november , when @entity35 spurned a deal with the @entity244 , favoring closer ties with @entity125 instead			0
