@entity0 -- enhanced security pat - downs that have been vilified by travelers as legal groping are here to stay , at least for now , the federal official in charge of transportation security told @entity1 on sunday			1
@entity8 , the administrator of the @entity9 , said he understood public discomfort over having a stranger touch the buttocks , breasts and genitals in trying to find possible hidden explosives , but he called the extra screening necessary			1
" we 're not changing the policies , because of ... the risks that have been identified , " @entity8 said on @entity1 's " @entity17			2
" " we know through intelligence that there are determined people , terrorists who are trying to kill not only @entity23 but innocent people around the world			0
" travelers who set off metal detectors at airport security are asked to undergo extra screening			2
if they refuse to go through an enhanced visual device that shows the body through clothing , they are required to submit to the thorough pat - down in order to fly			1
incidents such as last december 's failed bombing of a @entity23 - bound flight by a man with explosives in his underwear and the recent detection of explosives in air cargo packages from @entity44 prompted the enhanced screening			1
but the more thorough pat - down process has generated alarm and anger , with some travelers complaining they were given little warning of the procedure and that they felt violated by the touching of private parts			1
critics , including conservative @entity55 who generally oppose government regulation , say the enhanced screening is a knee - jerk and excessive reaction			2
" i do n't think the roll - out was good and the application is even worse , " rep. @entity59 , @entity60 , said sunday on " @entity17			0
" " this does need to be refined			0
but he 's saying it 's the only tool and i believe that 's wrong			0
" @entity67 also acknowledged the difficulty of the issue			0
asked if she would submit to an enhanced pat - down , secretary of state @entity70 told the @entity73 program " @entity74 " : " not if i could avoid it			1
no , i mean , who would ? " on the same program , rep. @entity79 of @entity80 , the second - ranking @entity82 @entity81 , said , " i do n't think any of us would want to undergo that , " but added that " most people understand that we 've got to keep airplanes safe			2
" @entity85 called for continuing study of the security situation to come up with the proper balance between protecting the public from terrorists and avoiding excessive screening			2
" if there is a way to limit the number of people who are going to be put through surveillance , that 's something that i 'm sure can be considered , " she said			0
@entity8 also spoke of seeking a balance between safety and public comfort			1
" i think it is situational , frankly , " he said on @entity1			0
" so for you , you may say , ' i want this level of security because i want to know that everybody else on that plane has been screened thoroughly			0
' somebody else may say , ' well , i would rather manage some risk and say i do n't want that thorough of screening , so i would rather take a higher risk			0
' " for the @entity9 , he said , " it comes down to how do we give the highest level of confidence to everybody on that flight that everybody else has been properly screened , including you and me ? " @entity8 noted that few passengers face the enhanced pat - down -- only those who trigger an initial safety alarm in the metal detector or document - screening , and then refuse to go through the advanced visual screening			1
" the advanced imaging technology is designed to detect non-metallics , " @entity8 said			0
" so you just have to make sure you take everything out of your pockets			0
so if there 's no alarm , there 's no pat - down			1
" he also complained of " horror stories " about the enhanced pat - down that he said are " frankly inaccurate , either misinformation or whatever			1
" at the same time , @entity8 acknowledged that travelers received little warning of the enhanced screening procedures , and therefore those who faced the more thorough pat - down were likely caught by surprise			1
" that 's my responsibility , because i did not advertise this , if you will , and say we are going to do this new type of pat - down , because i did not want to provide a blueprint or a road map to the terrorists to say , ' here 's our new security procedure , so here 's all you have to do to , ' " @entity8 said			1
@entity59 and other conservatives call for easing the use of enhanced screening for travelers who clearly pose no security risk			2
@entity59 cited @entity164 's use of passenger profiling based on travel history , age and other factors to determine more likely security risks			0
@entity8 , however , said the @entity23 does n't use the same kind of profiling , and he also noted that travelers who trigger a security question in @entity164 also undergo a rigorous pat - down			1
" that is top - notch security , " @entity8 said			2
" the question is , do we profile here in the @entity23 ? no , we do n't			0
so how then do we use intelligence that informs the decisions and judgements ? and given what we saw from last night in terms of this new web publication that describes in detail how the cargo bombs were done , how the design concealed , and how they are using technology to disguise and defeat the screening mechanisms we have in place ; look , it 's a difficult question			0

air travelers upset over more rigorous screening , touching
@entity8 says small number of travelers have to undergo enhanced pat - downs
screening tries to balance public safety with *personal* comfort , @entity8 says
