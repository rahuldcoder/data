-- @entity1 scored his first goal for @entity3 as the @entity5 champions defeated @entity7 winners @entity6 2 - 0 in @entity8 to win the @entity9 on friday			1
@entity11 international midfielder fabregas rejoined @entity3 from @entity12 for a fee in the region of $ 55 million earlier this month			1
and although he was not named in the starting side by @entity3 coach @entity16 , @entity1 showed his class after coming on as a substitute , bursting into the penalty area two minutes from the end to superbly chest down @entity23 's inch - perfect lobbed pass , before volleying home			1
what now for @entity12 and @entity1 ? @entity23 , who on thursday was handed @entity28 's inaugural @entity27 in @entity29 , celebrated that honor by opening the scoring in the 39th minute			1
a defensive mix - up left @entity23 through on goal , and the @entity35 maestro dummied @entity6 goalkeeper @entity36 before expertly sliding the ball home			2
the @entity40 side , who won their domestic league without losing a game last season , had two free - kick opportunities in the opening 45 minutes , but @entity48 striker @entity47 missed on both occasions			0
there was nothing to choose between the sides after the break , but @entity3 showed their squad depth by bringing on new signings @entity56 and @entity58 winger @entity57 , and they started to take control of the match			0
with four minutes to go , @entity6 had @entity61 sent off for hacking down @entity23 , and the 10 men then fell behind to @entity1 ' effort			2
and @entity6 's misery was complete in the final minute when @entity65 was also shown a straight red card for a late challenge on @entity68			0
the result gave @entity3 the trophy for the fourth time in their history and second in three years .			0

@entity3 defeat @entity6 2 - 0 to claim *victory* in the @entity9 in @entity8
