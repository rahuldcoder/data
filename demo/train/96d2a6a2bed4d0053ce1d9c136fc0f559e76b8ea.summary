-- @entity1 used to be a big deal for the @entity3			1
for much of the 20th century , organized labor was at the heart of @entity3 politics			2
unions were a driving force that gave the party its heart and its muscle			0
unfortunately for @entity3 , the importance of organized labor has diminished dramatically since the 1970s			2
union membership has declined from nearly 30 % of the workforce in the 1960s , according to the @entity16 , to what the @entity17 pegs at about 11 % today			1
politically , unions have become more controversial among @entity3 : once the status quo among @entity3 , now they are often seen as outliers			1
many democrats since the 1960s , including some environmentalists and civil rights advocates , concluded that unions were too often in opposition to their goals			1
even though he came from a progressive background , president @entity30 has repeatedly disappointed union leaders with his failure to support key proposals that would make it easier for unions to grow			1
the loss of organized labor 's clout within the workforce and among the @entity3 has been a devastating loss for the party			1
as the party turned away from this constituency and hesitated to support policies that would reverse the damaging trends that have hindered union membership , they have lost an animating force that could help sustain them in their struggles against a rightward bound @entity52			1
the relationship has a long , important history			0
the union movement was pivotal to the success of @entity58 's @entity57 in the 1930s			2
@entity58 and northern @entity3 pursued policies greatly benefiting the organization of industrial workers in @entity64 states like @entity65 and @entity66			2
in 1935 , @entity67 passed the @entity68 ( also known as the @entity68 ) , which formally gave workers the right to join a union and created the @entity72 , ensuring that employers allowed legitimate elections to take place			2
in 1936 , @entity58 said : " the @entity76 commemorates our political freedom			0
@entity1 symbolizes our determination to achieve an economic freedom for the average man which will give his political freedom reality			0
" while @entity58 's policies benefited workers , including the new @entity67 , or cio , labor came out in droves for the @entity3			1
they rallied workers on @entity91 , encouraged their members to show support for the party that had helped them , raised money to help @entity3 succeed , and their lobbyists on @entity98 constantly helped round up votes for a liberal agenda that ranged from bills that directly benefited workers to other measures with even greater constituencies			2
at the height of its power , the civil rights movement relied heavily on union leaders like @entity109 to win support for legislation in @entity67			1
unions were not simply useful allies ; their core mission embodied the basic goals of the @entity3 after @entity58			1
the entire point of collective bargaining was to create an economic system that would ensure a base of financial security for a large number of workers			1
unions could fight for the kinds of jobs that would create a ladder for hardworking @entity127 to enter into the middle class			0
without unions and the kinds of policies they helped @entity3 find support for , leaders like @entity109 realized , there would be very little to prevent the middle class from gradually withering away			1
from a very early moment in the centuryâ € ” long before economist @entity137 was publishing his controversial book on inequality , " @entity142 " â € ” unions insisted that the organizational basis of economic opportunity depended on workers acting in unison			2
the situation for organized labor took a terrible turn starting in the 1970s			0
many of the industries that were most heavily unionized in @entity64 states weakened			0
owners moved factories and their jobs to @entity153 , which had tough right - to - work laws that made it illegal to force workers in an organized workplace to join the union and pay dues , or transported business overseas			0
many of the most vibrant parts of the economy , such as the service and high - tech sector , did not offer unionized jobs			0
federal policies were no longer hospitable to unions			0
conservatives turned to legislation like the @entity174 ( 1947 ) to squeeze union power			0
some workers from unions turned to the @entity52 as part of the backlash to liberalism that unfolded after the 1960s			1
as labor became less important , a large number of @entity3 became cool to unions			2
president @entity185 angered union leaders in the late 1970s when he pushed for fiscal austerity and did n't back legislation that would have protected boycotts			1
president @entity190 clashed with unions over issues , including the @entity194 free trade treaty , while president @entity30 disappointed many when he did n't push for the @entity196 in 2009 and 2010			0
this tension is one that @entity3 need to ease			0
not only would the party benefit from healthier , more harmonious ties to the union movement , but also benefit from making the expansion of union membership and protection of labor rights a more central part of its national agenda			1
in an era when so many @entity127 worry about growing economic inequality and are desperate for answers to how the federal government and the private marketplace can stop the damage to the middle class , stronger support for unions would be a powerful step for @entity3 to take			1
" as unions shrank , " wrote @entity220 , " inequality grew			0
" democrats could offer a real alternative			0
it would offer a stark contrast to a @entity52 that has been extremely aggressive , at the national and state level , in its attacks on unions and the organization of the workforce			2
only if @entity3 take this step will they be able to nurture the part of their political coalition that was once so strong but is now so frail			0
only then will @entity3 once again start to celebrate and appreciate the importance of @entity1 to their party .			0

@entity239 : democrats and unions used to link their fortunes for *mutual* gain . that 's declined
he says union membership down , @entity3 *shy* away , vexing union leaders
but unions ' core mission *reflects* @entity3 ' basic goals : financial security for workers , he says
@entity239 : in era of income inequality , dems , unions should be allies , especially as @entity52 is n't
