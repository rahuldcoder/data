-- since @entity2 took over as ceo of @entity4 last year , there 's been a lot of talk about how the famously detail - oriented @entity7 will " refocus " the company			1
but it 's becoming increasingly clear that @entity10 is broadening , not narrowing , @entity4 's scope , cementing its once passé reputation as the original internet " portal			1
" the latest sign of this trend came just this past weekend , when multiple reports had @entity10 in talks to acquire the online television hub @entity19			1
less than one week earlier , @entity4 announced it would pay $ 1.1 billion for microblog network @entity20			1
two months ago , the company paid a reported $ 30 million to buy news digest app @entity23 from a @entity26 teenager			0
the common thread : @entity4 keeps expanding into new areas , even though it was already a sprawling internet conglomerate when @entity10 took control , with everything from movie listings to stock quotes to a photo - sharing social network to a news hub to a search engine			1
( and do n't forget the " @entity39 ! " section			0
) @entity4 's mission creep is a useful case study in why web companies like @entity43 and @entity44 continue to grow their functionality and why startups keep selling to the seemingly bloated leviathans , even though tech advances have made it cheaper and easier than ever for software companies and web services to go it alone , and despite the fact that consumers are migrating to highly specialized mobile apps			1
once upon a time , the idea of agglomerating lots of functionality in one website seemed like an obsolete throwback , a vain attempt to carry forward the glory days of the online portal in the late 1990s			1
portals had their time and place , but it was in the past , the thinking went , during a transitory period when it was expensive to build the most basic interactive website			0
that financial barrier gave well - capitalized internet companies the opportunity to dominate many verticals at once			2
the way of the future was going to be focused sites , like @entity76 , whose ultra-bare homepage was about nothing but search ( and whose guardian angel of minimalism was reportedly named @entity2 )			1
at one point in 2006 , a top @entity4 executive even issued a famous memo comparing @entity4 's extremely broad offerings to peanut butter , " a thin layer of investment spread across everything we do and thus we focus on nothing in particular ... we lack a focused , cohesive vision for our company			1
" interestingly , that executive , @entity96 , has since recanted his diagnosis of @entity4 , saying the company 's real problem was a lack of " passion and entrepreneurial zeal			1
" so why is @entity4 in the midst of purposely transforming itself into an über portal even as computer users are migrating to super-focused mobile apps and even when its leader made her name touting simplicity and minimalism ? and how did @entity43 , once the poster child for focus , end up as a sort of accidental portal , with its own social network , webmail site , online map , and video sharing service , to say nothing of its smartphone manufacturer or set of operating systems ? because we live in a world where the most valuable information -- and especially the demographic and tracking data coveted by online advertisers -- does not want to be free , and in fact is hoarded in proprietary databases that can only be assembled if you 're a portal , or look a lot like one			1
or at least this is part of the reason			0
the company historically derives virtually all its revenue selling ads around keywords , either the ones you type into its search engine or those you embed in your email messages and web pages			0
but then @entity44 came along and began selling ads around social information , like your birthday , what movies you like , and whether and where you want to college			0
that turned into a multi-billion - dollar business			2
then @entity151 came along and released the @entity152 , which has helped turn mobile advertising into another multi-billion - dollar business			1
both of these new online ad businesses threatened to replace or at least disrupt @entity43 's bread and butter keyword ads. and @entity43 was locked out of them ; the company ca n't get at your social data on @entity44 , and by default it does n't get your location data or @entity164 searches on the @entity152			1
while certain data is freely or routinely shared on the internet — ip and email addresses , search keywords you click on , browser and operating system identifiers — social and mobile data is locked away			2
so @entity43 went out and built its own social and mobile silos			2
the results have been mixed , but it 's better than nothing			0
hyper - focused startups face the same dilemma			2
consider the @entity184 mapping company @entity182			0
@entity182 makes an app that lets you easily share and view road traffic conditions , creating a nifty symbiotic relationship between users : you tell me what traffic is like where you are , and i 'll tell you what traffic is like where i am			0
but neither of us has an incentive to share data of value to @entity182 , information like demographics and shopping preferences that might help the company place high - priced ads within its free app. as a result , @entity182 has reportedly entered into acquisition talks with both @entity44 and @entity43 , two portal - like companies that could instantly monetize @entity182 by connecting the app to their trove of user dossiers			1
which brings us back to @entity4			2
you 'll notice @entity4 has no world - dominating social network like @entity44 , or even a respectable runner up like @entity216			1
it has to cobble together information about you from various sources , like information you 've attached to your @entity221 photo account , in your @entity223 signup , within your @entity225 portfolio tracker , via your @entity4 search history , and so on			2
@entity4 is motivated to expand , not narrow , the pool of potential information sources			2
buying @entity20 gives the company potentially valuable data on the interests of sophisticated young computer users ; @entity23 lets it see what news you are interested in while mobile ; @entity19 would provide insight into what television shows you prefer			1
meanwhile , each information source also doubles as an ad delivery channel			0
there is a real elegance to the idea of focused companies with clear missions and simple products			0
it is similarly attractive to imagine we can improve our complicated lives in this complex world by stitching together highly specialized apps that do one thing and do it well			0
" i 've always liked simplicity , " @entity10 once told a reporter			0
but software gets messy fast , and so it is with technology companies			0
it turns out that even on the open platform of the internet , where it 's never been easier or cheaper to launch an app , real benefits still accrue to large organizations with inelegant mashups of functionality and huge proprietary data sets			0
the portal is dead ; long live the portal			0
