-- we grew up in project buildings			1
we grew up at the end of cul - de - sacs			2
we grew up five miles from the nearest house			2
we grew up in @entity6			2
we come from backgrounds of luxury and struggle			2
we finished school with honors , and we dropped out			2
we voted for the first time , and we only just registered			2
we did n't understand red states or blue states			1
we understood that these are the @entity6			2
and as a generation , we millennials must be united in the fact that the collective power we possess will allow us to do great things for this country that we call our home			1
we must show this power en masse on @entity24 , one vote by one vote			1
millennials to candidates : talk to us we are bombarded with television analysis , newspaper opinions , blogs , tweets , @entity34 posts , radio commentators and street corner preachers that all offer some perspective about who will decide the election between president @entity41 and former @entity43 gov. @entity42			1
over the course of months , this commentary puts the power in the hands of various constituencies			1
every day , some new group gets handed the magic wand that will choose the winner of this year 's battle			2
opinion : why this election is so personal but , let me be straight			1
the battle begins with millennials , those much - maligned 18 - to 29 - year olds for whom so much is at stake			1
for this is our future			2
the future arrived yesterday , and the present presents us with an opportunity to dream big			2
dreams that in reality will uplift our entire generation , not just a percentage of us			1
dreams that are so deeply rooted in compassion , that there is no way we leave anyone behind			0
the undecided millennial our dreams from last night become our marching orders as we awake to the understanding that this election will be decided by millions of young people , our people , in states across this country			1
in @entity89 , @entity90 , a young woman will cast her ballot for the first time			0
in @entity94 , @entity53 , a university student will be the first in his family to vote in a presidential election			1
in @entity99 , @entity50 , a young couple will enter that voting both for the second time in their lives , this time not just voting for themselves but voting for their child			0
both campaigns have simplified their efforts to focus on 10 swing states			1
they will spend millions of dollars over the next few weeks targeting those states , as well as undecided voters			1
but some of us are not included in that game plan			0
some of us were left off the roll call			0
you know what means ? ' gen xer ' @entity117 makes case to young voters that means , like @entity123 said , we have the chance to shake up the world			0
show them who is the greatest			1
not just of this time , but of all time			0
show up in numbers that no one can believe			1
however you have to pull that lever , pull it			0
for this is our future			0
it is our brothers and sisters who are the ones coming home from @entity141 and @entity142 , many of whom feel like we have let them down			0
it is our colleges that are becoming too expensive for us to attend , leaving us with monthly payments that empty our bank accounts			0
it is our compadres who are impacted by the @entity152 and want only to live without fear in a country they , too , call their home			0
it is our @entity158 and @entity159 that might disappear before we even make it to the finish line			0
it is our boyfriends and girlfriends who just want to walk down the aisle and say two simple words : " i do			0
" it is our planet that is being destroyed by big business and politicians with oily pockets lined with dirty coal			0
this is what is at stake			0
not just an election to elect a president but an election to elect the destiny of our generation			1
have the youth given up on @entity41 ? so , let us promise to each other that we will not sit this one out			0
we will not watch this one pass us by			0
we will not move on to the next one			0
we will cast our ballots like our generation depended on it			1
for if we depend on one another , we will be united			0
not in red states or blue states , but in the @entity6			1
@entity189 is the editor - in - chief of @entity191 and the political director to @entity193			1
