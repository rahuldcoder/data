the number of @entity4 cases in @entity5 has not reached worst - case scenario predictions , but until it drops to zero , the world remains at risk , the @entity1 director said monday			1
speaking to reporters after a visit to @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 , @entity15 director dr. @entity14 said he saw " real momentum and real progress " in combating the virus			1
" it 's going to be a long hard fight , but i am hopeful that we are going to see continued progress			1
the challenge is not to let up , not to be complacent and to really double down , " he said			0
last week , the @entity25 put the number of reported deaths from @entity4 at 6,915 , with more than 18,600 cases of the disease reported			1
asked about the @entity1 's report in september that in certain scenarios , @entity4 cases could reach 550,000 by january , @entity14 said : " the projections we released a few months ago showed what could happen if nothing more were done -- in fact an enormous amount has been done			1
" he said what had changed was the world 's reaction response to not letting that happen			2
@entity11 had the " most hopeful picture " of the three countries , @entity14 said			1
" as of today , it has the upper hand over the virus			0
" this was due to the country 's implementation of the @entity4 approach , he said			1
extensive challenges remain , however , in @entity13 , he said			0
" @entity13 has by far the largest number of cases of the three countries at this point and is in a rapid scale - up phase			2
" this is in part a result of the " challenge of complacency , " he said			0
as the number of cases fell , he said , health care workers were " relaxing their grip " , by , for example , not wearing protective clothing or ignoring the possibility of @entity4 infection when treating patients for other ailments			1
three actions were important to combat the next phase of the outbreak , @entity14 said : first , break the cycle of exponential growth			2
second , trace every chain of transmission and ensure the intensive followup of every patient with @entity4			2
and third , strengthen the areas that were now @entity4 - free to prevent outbreaks there , he said			2
" the next phase is in many ways harder -- it 's tracing every single case to break every single chain of transmission including in highly mobile urban areas and that 's going to be challenging , " he said			0
" the problem is there are clusters all over and new ones popping up all the time			0
till each of the three countries get to the last cluster , the last case , then we 're at risk			0
" a lot had been done to combat @entity4 , @entity14 said , but it was still a " work in progress , " with -- for example -- more @entity103 - speaking health care workers needed in @entity12 to stop the spread there			1
tools on the horizon included a new point - of - care diagnostic kit that would allow health care workers to diagnose the virus on the spot -- rather than having to make sometimes arduous trips back from remote areas for lab testing of suspected cases			0
@entity14 said that another new initiative in @entity13 would allow the vaccination of thousands of health care workers -- if and when a safe vaccine was developed			0
but he said with new tools -- especially the vaccine -- " we have to ardently hope that they work urgently , but we ca n't count on them working			0

@entity1 director dr. @entity14 has just *returned* from @entity5
he described seeing " real progress " in the countries fighting @entity4
but @entity14 *warned* that until there were no more cases , the world was at risk
" it 's going to be a long , hard fight , " @entity14 said
