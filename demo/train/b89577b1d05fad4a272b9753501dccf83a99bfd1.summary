@entity0 -- when the pepper spray came out , the students only had moments to react			1
@entity5 , a wiry 23 - year - old engineering student , was at the front of around 2,000 young protesters on a highway when he was hit -- but what he remembers most is the way protesters cooperated with one another			1
" give umbrellas to the people in the front , " he heard people yelling			2
" the word spread like wildfire , " recalls @entity5 , who declined to give his last name			2
within moments , the crowd passed hundreds of umbrellas forward so that the most vulnerable protesters could shield themselves			0
high above on an overpass , onlookers opened their umbrellas and parachuted them down to waiting hands			0
" the cooperation was incredible , " he says			0
@entity0 protesters passionate but gullible that night , police fired 87 tear gas rounds into the crowds of unarmed students â € ” including @entity5 , who says protesters stuck together even as explosive blasts of stinging smoke blanketed the streets			1
luckily , he was n't injured			0
" we yelled to each other , ' go slowly , and look after others , " he says			0
" we relied on each other to get out safely			0
" in a city whose people have often been accused of being self - centered and materialistic , a palpable spirit of mutual aid has captured @entity0 's democracy movement			1
shaken and outraged by the police 's use of force sunday , tens -- if not hundreds of thousands of @entity49 have organized a movement that has stunned even activist leaders with its sophistication and size			1
coordinating themselves via @entity60 , @entity62 spreadsheets , and group messaging apps , citizens have set up a system of first aid stations , supply lines , rest areas , and barricades that now spans five major occupation sites			1
and the umbrella , unarmed students ' method of defense against pepper spray and tear gas , has turned into an iconic international symbol of peaceful resistance			1
meanwhile , police have staged a dramatic withdrawal			1
as a result , the civil disobedience movement has turned into what feels like a self - governed street utopia			1
early each morning , demonstrators stroll up and down , handing out free buns and drinks to their bleary - eyed companions			1
as the day progresses , they clean up trash and sing songs			0
" before sunday , people were numb , hopeless			0
but after the tear gas , we all came out to support each other , " says @entity5			1
@entity96 , a retired 60 - year - old nurse , decided to help after she heard students were tear gassed			1
" i was outraged at how casually the government could hurt young people			0
" now , she uses her medical skills to care for protesters , some of them who suffer symptoms of heatstroke after consecutive days of sitting in the humid heat			0
" democracy means we do n't just care about ourselves , but we care about everyone around us , " she says			2
@entity0 chief executive @entity110 : raw emotion ' will get us nowhere ' " we 're trying to understand each other " a few blocks away , a 54 - year - old democracy supporter surnamed @entity114 is volunteering at his church to provide a resting place , fully stocked with snacks , drinks , air conditioning , and tv for anyone in need â € ” even those on the other side			1
" the people who support the government might feel very hurt			0
we want to pray with them , we want to calm their hearts			0
" our religion tells us to love our enemy , and we want to respect them even though we have different opinions			0
" but even democracy supporters disagree with each other			2
what you need to know about the protests while sitting on an occupied highway on - ramp , a small group of protesters , including @entity5 , debate whether protesters are getting too relaxed			2
one , a college student , worries police want protesters to " soften and let their guard down " in order to come in and forcibly evict everyone			2
another , a middle - aged man , says he dislikes how some protesters are hosting barbecues and soccer games â € ” accusing them of making the movement seem unserious			1
" besides , if tear gas hits the barbecue flame , it could be really dangerous , " he says			1
@entity5 disagrees , believing the protest ought to be " joyful			2
" but , he points out , these discussions are exactly the sort of thing @entity0 desperately needs			1
" i just met those guys , but i know them better now			0
we have different ideas , but we 're finding a way to accept each other , " he says			0
" democracy is n't just about voting for our next leader			2
it 's about seeing the equality of others			0
" we 're trying to understand each other , and in that process , we 're coming to understand ourselves			0

@entity0 police fired 87 tear gas rounds at unarmed students , *enraging* the *public*
citizens have responded by *flocking* to protest sites
the movement has turned into what feels like a idealistic , self - governed street utopia
democracy is about " seeing the humanity of others , " says protester
