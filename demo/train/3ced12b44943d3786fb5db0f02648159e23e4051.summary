@entity0 -- president @entity2 got some political cover sunday for his upcoming announcement on sending more troops to @entity6			0
a report released by the @entity9 staff of the @entity10 blamed the @entity12 administration for failing to capture or kill @entity13 when the @entity15 leader was cornered in @entity6 's @entity17 mountain region in december 2001			1
the report , released sunday , said the situation in @entity6 presented greater problems today because of the failure to nab @entity13 eight years ago			1
@entity13 had written his will , apparently sensing he was trapped , but the lack of sufficient forces to close in for the kill allowed him to escape to tribal areas in @entity27 , according to the report			1
it said former defense secretary @entity30 and top @entity32 commander gen. @entity31 held back the necessary forces for a " classic sweep - and - block maneuver " that could have prevented @entity13 's escape			1
" it would have been a dangerous fight across treacherous terrain , and the injection of more @entity32 troops and the resulting casualties would have contradicted the risk - averse , ' light footprint ' model formulated by @entity30 and @entity31 , " the report said			1
when criticized later for not zeroing in on @entity13 , administration officials , including former vice president @entity46 , responded that the @entity15 leader 's location was uncertain			2
" but the review of existing literature , unclassified government records and interviews with central participants underlying this report removes any lingering doubts and makes it clear that @entity13 was within our grasp at @entity17 , " the report said			2
on tuesday , @entity2 will travel to @entity60 , @entity61 , to announce his decision on a request by his commanding general in @entity6 for up to 40,000 additional troops			0
@entity2 is expected to send more than 30,000 @entity32 troops and seek further troop commitments from @entity68 allies as part of a counterinsurgency strategy to wipe out @entity15 elements and stabilize the country while training @entity6 forces			1
by releasing the report sunday , sen. @entity74 , chairman of the @entity10 , focused attention on the past failure of the @entity12 administration to take out @entity13 , saying that had created a greater problem today			1
" our inability to finish the job in late 2001 has contributed to a conflict today that endangers not just our troops and those of our allies , but the stability of a volatile and vital region , " @entity74 , @entity81 , wrote in a letter of transmittal for the report			0
when @entity74 was the @entity9 presidential nominee in 2004 , he argued that the @entity12 administration botched the pursuit of @entity13 and that then - president @entity12 " took his eye off the ball " in @entity6 to invade @entity98			2
the accusations were hotly disputed by @entity12 supporters and @entity101			0
however , @entity102 , the @entity103 operative who led the pursuit of @entity13 at @entity17 , said in 2005 that his request for up to 800 @entity32 troops to cut off the @entity15 leader 's escape route was denied			1
sen. @entity107 , the ranking @entity108 on the @entity109 , told @entity1 's " @entity110 " that the new report " does serve as a convenient way for , perhaps , @entity9 to say once again , there 's another failing of the past administration " and that " all the problems have accumulated			0
" " i think we have to accept that there were many failings , " said @entity107 , of @entity117			0
" but the problem right now is , what do we do presently ? what will the president 's plan be ? how much confidence do we have in this president and this plan ? " @entity9 sen. @entity130 of @entity131 , responding to @entity107 's comment , told @entity1 that @entity2 faced " the culmination of decisions that were made eight years " earlier , which he said " made the situation much more difficult " today			0
according to the report , " removing the @entity15 leader from the battlefield eight years ago would not have eliminated the worldwide extremist threat			0
" " but the decisions that opened the door for his escape to @entity27 allowed @entity13 to emerge as a potent symbolic figure who continues to attract a steady flow of money and inspire fanatics worldwide , " it said			2
the report called @entity13 's escape " a lost opportunity that forever altered the course of the conflict in @entity6 and the future of international terrorism , leaving the @entity32 people more vulnerable to terrorism , laying the foundation for today 's protracted @entity6 insurgency and inflaming the internal strife now endangering @entity27			1
" the report also highlighted @entity13 's will , dated december 14 , 2001 , as an indication of the dire situation he faced			2
" @entity13 expected to die , " it said , noting that a copy of the will that surfaced later is regarded as authentic			1
" @entity168 commended to us that when death approaches any of us that we make a bequest to parents and next of kin and to @entity180 as a whole , " the report quoted @entity13 's will as saying , adding that he " instructed his wives not to remarry and apologized to his children for devoting himself to " holy war			2
however , the report said , " fewer than 100 @entity32 commandos were on the scene with their @entity6 allies and calls for reinforcements to launch an assault were rejected			0
" " requests were also turned down for @entity32 troops to block the mountain paths leading to sanctuary a few miles away in @entity27 , " it continued			1
" the vast array of @entity32 military power , from sniper teams to the most mobile divisions of the @entity196 and the @entity197 , was kept on the sidelines			0
instead , the @entity32 command chose to rely on airstrikes and untrained @entity6 militias to attack @entity13 and on @entity27 's loosely organized @entity202 to seal his escape routes			1
" on or around december 16 , two days after writing his will , @entity13 and an entourage of bodyguards walked unmolested out of @entity17 and disappeared into @entity27 's unregulated tribal area			0
most analysts say he is still there today			0
