-- @entity3 plans to consider all its options after it reviews a jury verdict that found it was negligent in a 2007 shooting rampage that left 33 people dead , including the gunman , a university spokesman said			1
the move follows wednesday 's verdict by a seven - member jury in @entity13 , @entity14 , that awarded $ 4 million each to two victims ' families who sued the state for wrongful death in the shooting massacre			1
" we are disappointed with today 's decision and stand by our long - held position that the administration and law enforcement at @entity3 did their absolute best with the information available on april 16 , 2007 , " @entity20 , a university spokesman , said in a statement			1
" we will discuss this matter with the attorney general , carefully review the case and explore all of the options available			0
" the jury found @entity3 failed to notify students early enough following the discovery of two shooting victims at @entity38 dormitory			1
the two students were the first victims of @entity40 , who went on to kill 30 more people at @entity42 -- home to the @entity44 -- after chaining the doors closed			1
he also wounded 17 people before killing himself			1
the families of @entity49 and @entity50 , who were killed in @entity42 , argued that had officials notified students , faculty and staff earlier of the shooting at the dormitory , lives might have been spared			1
@entity49 died while in her @entity58 class ; @entity59 was shot while attending an advanced hydrology class			2
the @entity49 and @entity59 families did not accept a portion of an $ 11 million settlement between the state and the families of victims , opting instead to sue for wrongful death			1
" it certainly was the end of a long process for us where we just said we wanted to get a little bit more truth			0
a little bit of accountability and we were n't just going to go away , and so we came here and this is what happened , " @entity59 , @entity50 's father , told @entity0 affiliate @entity73 of @entity74 , @entity14			0
while the jury awards the families $ 4 million each , an attorney for the state has asked the judge to reduce the verdict to $ 100,000 per claim			1
state law limits awards to $ 100,000 , though the judge approved a request by an attorney for the family to file a motion on the matter			0
the university does not believe the evidence presented during the trial showed there was an increased danger on campus , @entity20 , the university spokesman , said			0
@entity3 president @entity102 , in a letter to the school 's faculty , staff and students , said the killings " were an unprecedented act of violence that no one could have foreseen			2
" the evidence presented during the trial " established that it was the unanimous decision of three law enforcement agencies that the mass shooting was simply not foreseeable			0
only with hindsight can one conclude that @entity40 's unprecedented acts were foreseeable , " @entity114 , a spokesman for the state attorney general , said in a statement following the verdict			2
authorities initially believed the shooting at the dormitory was a case of domestic violence , a jealous boyfriend who shot the couple			2
while police were questioning a possible suspect , @entity40 opened fire at @entity42			2
the @entity130 found , in a 2010 report , that @entity3 did not notify students in a " timely manner " -- as dictated by what is known as the @entity135 -- after the shooting at the dormitory			1
