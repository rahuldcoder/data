-- a federal judge 's ruling wednesday cleared the way for a controversial mosque in @entity5 to open in time for the start of the @entity8 holy month of @entity9			1
county officials must conduct a final building inspection at the mosque in @entity15 , near @entity16 , @entity11 district judge @entity10 said in a temporary restraining order			1
the order will allow the mosque to complete the inspection process so it can use its building in time for the religious holiday of @entity9 , which starts at sunset thursday , the @entity18 said in a statement			1
" this is a great victory not just for the @entity27 of @entity15 , but for people of all faiths			0
no house of worship should be kept from meeting just because the neighbors do n't like their religious beliefs , " said @entity30 , deputy general counsel at the @entity32 - based fund , which represented the mosque in a federal lawsuit			2
the @entity41 and the @entity42 filed separate lawsuits this week , arguing that @entity45 officials violated federal laws when they denied requests for a final inspection and certificate of occupancy for the mosque			1
the center argued that it was being unconstitutionally blocked " merely because local @entity55 protests have made the mosque controversial			0
" @entity41 officials coordinated the timing of their lawsuit with the local case because they thought there would be " irreparable harm " if the mosque were not allowed to open for @entity9 , spokesman @entity57 said			1
plans for the mosque have resulted in threats to the center and a lawsuit that led to a county judge 's order shutting down the project in june			1
county officials had cited that order when they denied requests for the final inspection			1
the construction site had been vandalized multiple times , including by an arson attack in 2010 , and federal authorities have charged a @entity81 man with calling in a bomb threat to the center before last year 's anniversary of the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on @entity85 and @entity32			2
@entity5 mosque 's fate up in the air after court ruling the center 's lawsuit argued that it was ordered to meet " a heightened standard of notice in the zoning process " because of objections by some @entity15 residents , a standard no other religious institution has been asked to meet			0
" this double standard for the mosque has deprived @entity42 of its legal rights under federal law and the @entity103 , serves no public purpose and threatens to cripple @entity42 's ability to observe @entity9 , " the lawsuit states			2
the project had been approved by a planning commission and was under construction when @entity110 reversed that approval because of what he said was the insufficient notice			0
the county followed its normal practice of publishing notice of the hearing in the local newspaper , but @entity110 said more should have been done because the mosque was " an issue of major importance to citizens			0
" four county residents filed suit to block the mosque in september 2010 , arguing it posed a " risk of terrorism generated by proselytizing for @entity8 and inciting the practices of @entity131 law " and that planning commissioners violated their due process rights			0
they also demanded the judge bar any approval until the @entity42 center showed that it was not interested in " the overthrow of the @entity11 system of government , laws and freedoms guaranteed by our @entity103			0
" on wednesday , @entity10 ruled that the @entity41 had " demonstrated that the mosque is necessary to accommodate the number of worshipers , especially during the holy season of @entity9 , which begins july 20			2
the new building , which is ready to serve the community , eliminates the facilities problems , providing ample space for prayer , holiday celebrations , religious meetings and children 's play			0
" @entity156 said in a statement that the center was " delighted by the judge 's decision			2
" " we look forward to celebrating @entity9 with our neighbors , " he said			1
opinion : @entity11 , how can @entity8 - @entity11 reach non-muslims ? living under the headscarf @entity0 's @entity166 and @entity167 contributed to this report .			0
