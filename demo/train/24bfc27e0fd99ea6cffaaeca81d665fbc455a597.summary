-- life was good for @entity2			1
a handsome man with a big smile , he was well - known in his town of @entity6 , @entity7			1
he had a loving wife , two beautiful , college - age children and was the co-owner of a multimillion - dollar contracting business			1
at 49 he had it all			1
but then he began to change			1
at first the family thought @entity2 had alzheimer 's disease ; he had all the signs			1
but they got a diagnosis that turned out to be more devastating			1
@entity2 has a condition known as frontotemporal dementia , or @entity20			1
when doctors told @entity2 's wife , @entity23 , she was relieved			1
" i was thankful it was n't @entity25 's , " she said			1
" clearly , what did i know ? " she noticed the first changes more than four years ago			1
" he was stumbling over words , " she said			1
" and he would forget what he was saying -- but at almost 50 , i think we all tend to do that			1
" @entity2 's personality was n't the same , either			1
he grew distant , more agitated			1
@entity23 thought it was stress , that the pressure of work was getting to him			1
but as the months went by , his condition got worse			1
he was put on medication for depression			1
although it helped , @entity23 said , " he just was n't @entity2			1
" his children also noticed the change			1
during a family trip to @entity44 , he hardly spoke			2
his son , @entity45 , knew this was n't his dad			2
" he 'd tell stupid jokes all the time , " said @entity45			2
" and on this trip , he was n't telling jokes			2
he was sitting there with a blank stare on his face			2
" his daughter , @entity53 , noticed that @entity2 did n't care about his health any longer			2
" he exercised all the time			2
he would swim constantly and he ate well , " she said			2
" and all of a sudden he was downing gallons of ice cream			2
gallons ! " watch more of the @entity60 ' family odyssey but it was his inability to communicate that finally pushed @entity23 into action			2
" we were working on a project ... and he turned to me and asked me , can you give me that screwdriver with the little cross on top , " she recalled			2
" and then i knew : this was a man who built his house from the ground up and he could n't ask for a @entity78 screwdriver ? " @entity23 got @entity2 to the doctor			2
during the course of numerous cognitive tests , @entity23 learned details about her husband that were shocking			2
" he could n't draw a clock and put the numbers or hands on it , " she said			2
doctors told her , @entity20 would rob @entity2 of his personality , his speech and eventually his life			1
" they told me , ' if you are going to travel or do anything with your husband , you 'd better do it in the next few years , ' " she said			2
" and that 's when i fell apart			2
" @entity99 dementia is an umbrella term for a group of degenerative disorders that damage the cells in the temporal and / or frontal lobes of the brain			1
doctors believe certain proteins in the brain attack the cells			1
they do n't know why			2
the disease is typically diagnosed in people in their 50s and 60s , but can strike people in their 40s or younger			1
it affects areas of the brain responsible for reasoning , communication , social awareness and memory , causing changes in personality and judgment			1
although its symptoms can vary depending on the parts of the brain affected , @entity20 eventually leaves a patient in a state of confusion and helplessness			1
it also leaves affected families feeling helpless			2
" many patients will lose their inhibitions ; they 'll act totally inappropriately , leaving their families to wonder what is wrong , " said dr. @entity131 , a neurologist with the @entity132			1
" some patients will have no problem spending the family fortune , taking all their money and putting it into scams , get - rich - quick schemes , or going off and buying an expensive car or boat the family does n't need			1
the patients lose their reasoning			1
" " what 's particularly frustrating for family members is , the patients do n't seem to have much insight into the difficulties they are having or causing for others , " @entity131 said			2
@entity20 affects approximately 250,000 @entity154 -- about 10 percent to 20 percent of all dementia cases -- and misdiagnosis is common , according to the @entity157			1
" there 's a great lack of awareness among physicians			0
so on the journey to diagnosis many of our families take five or six years [ before they find out ] , and they go through a series of misdiagnoses , " said @entity162 , director of the association			0
@entity131 said misdiagnoses can cause trouble			0
" many patients take on symptoms of a stroke and , of course , @entity25 's or even severe depression and are misdiagnosed , which can be dangerous because many of the medications used for these conditions can make @entity20 worse , " said @entity131			1
" so correct diagnosis is critical			0
" " and when they do get the news , it 's very difficult , " said @entity162			0
" they are told , ' your loved one has @entity20			0
it 's a neurological degenerative disease			0
it 's fatal , and there is no cure			0
now go home and deal with it			0
' " and that 's what @entity162 wants to change			0
the association is trying to get the word out by offering resources for physicians and information on support groups for families through its organization and on its web site			0
@entity162 says 40 support groups have been formed so far , " most of them started by families and volunteers			0
" " because many of our patients are diagnosed in the prime of their lives , families are faced with financial problems			0
where do they go for help ? how can they better deal with this disease ? " said @entity162			0
" that 's what we are here for : to help them find resources and ways of coping			0
" the association also wants to raise money for more research			0
although at this point there are few treatments and no cure , dr. @entity131 says there is hope			1
" the good news is that as we learn more about the condition we are developing treatments that are specific , that we hope can change the natural history of the condition , " he said			1
" so there are medications in development that go after the proteins that accumulate in the brain cells that cause this condition			1
" in the four years since his @entity20 was diagnosed , @entity2 has taken trips with his family			0
until recently he was able to ride a bike and get around , although he ca n't drive a car			0
he has become progressively more dependent on @entity23 , who quit her job to be with him 24/7			0
" his need to be with me is constant , because he feels safe , " she said			0
although @entity2 goes with a caretaker several times a week to give @entity23 a break , keeping up with him can be exhausting			0
" he ca n't read a clock			0
so he 'll get up at 3 a.m. , and that 's when we start our day , " said @entity23			0
right after the diagnosis he had good days and bad days , @entity23 said			0
" and when he had bad days , they were very bad			0
" now , he 's more like a child , most times			0
" when @entity2 's children visit , it can be hard for them to see him slip away			0
" when he has his bad days and he lashes out it makes it hurt more , and that 's when you have to blame the disease , " said daughter @entity53			0
" you 've got to understand your dad is actually gone , and it 's the disease			0
" @entity23 looks at it differently			0
" our doctor says if we do n't take this on with a sense of humor our family will be destroyed , " she said			0
" in so many ways we 've been blessed			0
so we 've got to keep going with a good heart			0
" " a lot of our friends and family do n't understand this illness			0
but we do , " she said indicating her children			0
" and we have to deal with it			0
" " there is no one hardest part , " @entity23 said			1
" well , for me , knowing that the man i thought i was going to grow old with -- i 'm not , i guess			0
" @entity23 stopped , and with tears in her eyes , realized , " yes , that 's the hardest part			1

@entity99 dementia affects part of brain responsible for personality , memory , reasoning
250,000 people in the @entity154 have it , representing 10 - 20 percent of dementia cases
the condition is often misdiagnosed , resulting in wrong medications
hope on the *horizon* as researchers target the proteins that accumulate in the brain cells
