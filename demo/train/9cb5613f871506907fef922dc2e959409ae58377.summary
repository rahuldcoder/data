@entity0 -- president @entity2 launched a major assault tuesday on the @entity6 - passed @entity5 budget proposal embraced by front - running @entity5 presidential candidate @entity7 , calling it " social darwinism " that would stifle the @entity10 dream			1
in a speech to a media luncheon , @entity2 described the measure -- prepared by @entity15 chairman @entity14 , @entity16 , and passed by the @entity6 -- as a " @entity17 " that is disguised as a deficit reduction plan but actually imposes a " radical vision			1
" " it is thinly - veiled @entity21 , " @entity2 said			2
" it is antithetical to our entire history as a land of opportunity and upward mobility for everyone who 's willing to work for it -- a place where prosperity does n't trickle down from the top , but grows outward from the heart of the middle class			0
" he added that " by gutting the very things we need to grow an economy that 's built to last -- education and training ; research and development ; infrastructure -- it 's a prescription for decline			0
" the remarks signaled @entity2 's full engagement in his re-election campaign for the november vote as @entity7 has seized an apparently solid grip on the @entity5 nomination			1
for the first time this year , @entity2 mentioned the former @entity50 governor by name in a speech , noting @entity7 's support for the @entity14 budget plan			1
" one of my potential opponents , gov. @entity7 , has said that he hoped a similar version of this plan from last year would be introduced on day one of his presidency , " @entity2 said			2
" he said that he 's very supportive of this new budget and he even called it marvelous , which is a word you do n't often hear when it comes to describing a budget			0
" @entity14 and other @entity5 leaders immediately criticized the @entity2 speech as a politically motivated appeal to populism , rather than a serious approach to budget deficits			1
" history will not be kind to a president who , when it came time to confront our generation 's defining challenge , chose to duck and run , " @entity14 said in a statement			1
" the president refuses to take responsibility for the economy and refuses to offer a credible plan to address the most predictable economic crisis in our history			2
instead , he has chosen tired and cynical political attacks as he focuses on his own re-election			0
" according to @entity14 , @entity2 used his speech to " distort the truth and divide @entity10 in order to distract from his failed record			1
" @entity2 , however , blamed a polarized political climate for an inability to make progress on such key issues as deficit reduction and entitlement reform , arguing that @entity5 have shifted to the right and dropped support for moderate proposals acceptable to @entity103			1
" the problem right now is not the technical means to solve it			0
the problem is our politics , and that 's part of what this election and what this debate will need to be about , " @entity2 said in response to a question at the end			2
" are we , as a country , willing to get back to commonsense , balanced , fair solutions that encourage our long - term economic growth and stabilize our budget ? " @entity2 has increasingly portrayed the upcoming election as a choice between maintaining his policies and vision for continued economic recovery and investment in future growth versus what he calls failed @entity5 policies of the past based on deep spending cuts and lower taxes intended to benefit the corporate class			1
" in this country , broad - based prosperity has never trickled down from the success of a wealthy few , " @entity2 said tuesday			1
" it has always come from the success of a strong and growing middle class			0
" in particular , he focused on the @entity14 budget proposal for 2013 recently passed by the @entity5 - led @entity6			1
the $ 3.5 trillion plan would lower tax rates and cut spending while reforming the @entity148 and @entity149 government - run health care programs for senior citizens , the disabled and the poor			2
@entity14 and other conservatives argue that major reforms are needed to subdue increasing federal deficits and debt , with particular focus on entitlement programs that are the main contributors to the budget imbalance			2
for example , the @entity14 budget would convert federal @entity149 funding for states into block grants			2
such a step could increase the cost burden on states , but would give them more autonomy about how to set up their @entity149 programs			0
as a result , a state could reduce how many people are eligible or increase enrollees ' cost - sharing obligations			0
" if the president were serious , he would put forward a plan to deal with our debt crisis and save @entity183 , @entity148 , and @entity149 for future generations of seniors without raising taxes on small businesses that are struggling in this economy , " house speaker @entity175 , @entity176 , said in a statement tuesday			2
" instead , he has chosen to campaign rather than govern , and the debt crisis he is presiding over is only getting worse			0
" @entity2 , however , called the @entity14 budget an attempt to shift the burden of deficit reduction to the middle class and the needy			1
he outlined what he said would be cuts in government programs that provide early education , student loans and research grants as examples of the sweep of the @entity5 proposal			0
the @entity205 's proposal to alter @entity148 -- the government health care program for senior citizens -- would provide vouchers to help pay for health coverage rather than the universal plan of today , @entity2 said			0
people would have to pay any cost increases or expenses beyond the vouchers , which amounts to shifting the cost burden to senior citizens , the president asserted			0
" it 's a bad idea and eventually will end @entity148 as we know it , " @entity2 said in targeting one of the most politically sensitive provisions of the @entity14 plan			1
@entity2 also criticized tax cuts in the @entity14 budget that he said would cost $ 4.6 trillion over the next decade			1
such a move would benefit the wealthy while reducing tax breaks relied on by middle class families , such as the mortgage interest deduction , the president said			0
" this is supposed to be about paying down our deficit ? it 's laughable , " @entity2 said			0
he repeated his longstanding support for a balanced approach to deficit reduction that includes increased tax revenue through higher rates on the wealthy			0
@entity2 again called for adoption of the so - called @entity241 rule , a proposal that would have all @entity10 making more than $ 1 million pay at least a 30 % tax rate			2
the @entity245 is expected to vote on a form of the proposal named for billionaire @entity241 , who has complained that the current tax code allows him to pay a lower tax rate than his secretary			0
the @entity2 speech to a luncheon by @entity253 at the @entity255 convention occurred on the same day as primary elections in @entity257 , @entity258 and the @entity0			1
@entity2 also scheduled high - profile events on previous primary days this year , including a speech at a @entity262 conference on the day of the @entity264 primary in february , a news conference on @entity266 in early march and a visit to an opening @entity269 basketball tournament game with visiting @entity271 prime minister @entity270 on the night that @entity272 and @entity273 voted			1
@entity275 's @entity274 and @entity1 's @entity276 , @entity277 and @entity278 contributed to this report .			0
