@entity0 -- few answers have emerged to the myriad questions about the @entity5 bombing and its aftermath , but that did n't stop political leaders from clashing about what happened and why it did on sunday talk shows			1
@entity13 members of @entity14 played up a possible connection to global terrorists and said the lone surviving suspect should be designated an enemy combatant to allow unfettered questioning and unlimited detention			1
@entity22 legislators called for handling the 19 - year - old suspect as a crime suspect rather than a war enemy , allowing the @entity28 citizen the right to legal representation under federal law that could impose the death penalty			1
a closer look at their statements and arguments showed how politicians blend facts , conjecture and spin to push their side 's agenda while countering arguments from across the aisle			2
the facts so far tell a still - convoluted story			0
@entity49 and @entity50 , brothers of northern @entity47 origin who had lived in the @entity28 for years , allegedly set off two bombs near the finish line of monday 's @entity5 , killing three people and injuring more than 170			0
@entity54 : ' @entity55 was dropped ' in probe of @entity49 after the @entity58 released video footage and photos of the pair on thursday , they allegedly shot to death a university police officer and carjacked a getaway vehicle , leading to a wild chase through @entity66 and its suburbs that ended with @entity49 dead and @entity50 on the lam			1
he was captured friday night to culminate a day of door - to - door searches in an unprecedented manhunt in parts of @entity66 and its suburbs			1
with authorities still trying to nail down exactly what happened and why , the political chatter on sunday provided more partisan posturing than solid answers			1
republicans focused on a six - month trip last year to @entity79 and perhaps his former @entity81 homeland and other @entity84 regions by @entity85 , the elder brother who some family members said had become a radicalized @entity87 in recent years			0
timeline : a look at @entity49 's past the chairmen of the powerful @entity93 committees focused on @entity49 's travels , insinuating links to terrorist training without making any definitive declarations or accusations			0
" he , we believe , may have actually traveled on an alias to get back to his home country , " rep. @entity99 , the @entity100 @entity13 who chairs the intelligence panel , told @entity103			1
" ... so you know he had some radicalization before he left			0
you know that he did n't probably travel on his own name or some variation of his own name			0
and when he comes back , he has a renewed interest in that radicalization belief process			0
" add it all up , @entity99 said , and " it would lead one to believe that 's probably where he got that final radicalization to push him to commit acts of violence and where he may have received training on what we ultimately saw last monday			0
" rep. @entity128 , the @entity13 from @entity129 who chairs the homeland security committee , hinted to reporters that @entity49 made additional trips to the northern @entity47 than the 2012 visit made public by authorities			1
' enemy combatant ' can be tried in civilian court " we know he 's starting to radicalize in 2009 , which would lead me to the , um , yeah , i could speculate that he was probably going over there more often , " said @entity128 , who is privy to congressional briefings on the matter			1
" we do n't have -- i do n't have the evidence of that just yet			2
but that 's obviously an area of focus			0
" asked specifically about confirmation that @entity49 made other trips , @entity128 acknowledged that " it 's unconfirmed at this point , " but added : " my judgment is we 'll probably see there were other trips to the region			0
" such conjecture seeks in part to raise the specter of international terrorism at a time when @entity14 is wrestling with deficit reduction issues including forced spending cuts to the military and other government services			2
while concerns of an international terrorism link to the @entity66 bombers remains high , conservatives seek any opportunity to reinforce the need to maintain military readiness and national security in order to protect it as a spending priority amid the austerity debate in @entity0			1
@entity177 rep. @entity177 , who has complained that @entity28 let down its guard against terrorism , told " @entity180 " he was referring specifically to @entity14			0
" some of my own party want to start cutting funding for homeland security because they think this war is over , " @entity177 said			0
" meanwhile , @entity22 legislators pushed back against @entity13 calls for designating 19 - year - old @entity50 a war enemy to allow unfettered interrogation and possible indefinite detention , like terrorism suspects at @entity192			1
instead , they argued the suspect , who is hospitalized in serious but stable condition with wounds that included a gunshot to the throat , should be treated as a crime suspect with the right to legal representation			2
" i do n't think we have to cross the line and say he should be an enemy combatant , which could be challenged in court , " @entity22 sen. @entity202 of @entity203 told @entity1			1
@entity66 's week of terror the issue dates to the " war on terror " from the @entity213 administration after the 9/11 attacks , and remains a sore point for liberals who question the constitutionality of designating a naturalized citizen such as the younger @entity85 as an enemy combatant			1
@entity202 and follow @entity22 sen. @entity220 of @entity221 emphasized that a federal criminal charge against @entity85 could carry the death penalty in an effort to show their party was n't soft on terrorism			2
" the federal law allows the death penalty , " @entity202 said , noting that he wrote it in 1994			0
" this is just the kind of case that it should be applied to			0
in fact , the only other time it 's been used since ' 94 is on ( @entity238 bomber ) @entity239 and given the facts that i 've seen , it would be appropriate to use the death penalty in this case and i would hope they would apply it in federal court			0
" @entity220 told reporters that @entity85 could be interrogated now for any information on possible further terrorism threats under a public safety exception to immediately informing a suspect of @entity253 rights			2
" if he 's not mirandized , it ca n't be used in a court of law , " she said , noting authorities already had " plenty of evidence " that can be used to convict him			2
suspects initially questioned under the public safety exemption and then later tried in civilian court include @entity263 , the " underwear bomber " who attempted to blow up a @entity268 - bound airliner on christmas day in 2009 , and @entity264 for his 2010 attempt to detonate a bomb in @entity271			0
conservative @entity13 sen. @entity54 of @entity272 made a similar argument to @entity1 in calling for @entity85 to be declared an enemy combatant for now , then later being criminally charged and put to trial in a civilian court			1
according to @entity54 , a public safety exception to reading @entity253 rights will expire , meaning the ability to continue interrogating @entity85 could be jeopardized by his right to remain silent and be represented by an attorney			0
the public safety exception to the @entity253 rule allows investigators to question suspects before apprising him of their rights when they believe there is an imminent public safety threat			0
did one brother brainwash the other ? despite @entity54 's warning that the exception will expire , attorney general @entity291 has opened the door to longer interrogations for that purpose in cases involving " operational " terrorists			0
another political dispute stemming from the @entity66 bombings involved calls by some conservative republicans to put off consideration of bipartisan immigration reform legislation for now			1
@entity13 sen. @entity305 of @entity306 said sunday that @entity14 should wait until the emotional reaction to the bombings subsides before tackling the volatile issue of immigration			1
his comment to @entity311 followed a similar call last week by fellow @entity313 sen. @entity313 of @entity314 , who noted the @entity85 brothers were immigrants			0
" it 's important for us to understand the gaps and loopholes in our immigration system , " @entity313 said , asking " how can individuals evade authorities and plan such attacks on our soil ? " @entity202 , one of the " @entity327 " senators who drafted the immigration plan , said some on the right who opposed the bill were using the @entity66 bombing as an excuse to stall the legislation			1
" if they have a reason , a suggestion as to how to change it based on what happened in @entity66 , we 'll certainly be open to it , " @entity202 said			2
" but we 're not going to let them use what happened in @entity66 as an excuse , because our law toughens things up			2
" @entity54 , a @entity13 co-author , agreed it was time to tackle the immigration issue , saying " we need to move on			1
" immigration reform resonates with the @entity350 - @entity28 community , which is the nation 's fastest - growing demographic and heavily supported president @entity354 's re-election last year			1
@entity58 disputes mother 's claim they tracked elder bombing suspect @entity1 's @entity358 and @entity359 contributed to this report .			2
