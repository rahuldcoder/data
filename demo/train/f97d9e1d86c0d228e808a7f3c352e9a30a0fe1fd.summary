@entity0 -- her social security card is in the name of @entity5 , and so is her driver 's license			0
but her birth certificate has the name @entity9			1
this is not a case of identity fraud			0
@entity5 said she has been trying to get the gender listed on her birth certificate changed for years			1
" i know what was on my birth certificate was a mistake			1
it was an error , " @entity5 said			0
" you did n't necessarily have to have medical testing ( to say you were born male or female			0
) all they did was take a look at you			0
" states that already allow gender changes on birth certificates without proof of surgery include @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , the @entity34 and the state of @entity0 -- but not @entity36 , says @entity37 , staff attorney for the @entity40 's @entity39 project			1
in @entity36 , for @entity5 to get her gender changed on her birth certificate , she would have to show proof of " convertive surgery , " or what some call gender reassignment surgery			1
but a proposed change in the health code would mean that anyone who wants to change the gender listed on their birth certificate will no longer need proof of surgery to make that change			1
instead , someone can simply get an affidavit from a licensed health professional confirming the need for a gender change			1
@entity36 councilman @entity60 , who sponsored the bill , said a proposed list of professionals who could sign off on the change ranges from physicians to mental health counselors			1
the proposal has the backing of council speaker @entity69			2
" for me , this is catching up with what other states and municipalities have done , " @entity60 said			1
both @entity60 and the @entity40 agree that the change would benefit those who struggle financially and need public assistance with food , medical care and housing			1
" birth certificates are often the only form of @entity82 that low income @entity36 have when applying for jobs or public benefits , " @entity60 said			1
at the federal level , @entity37 said people who opt to change their gender classification on social security cards and passports no longer need surgical proof of a surgical gender change			1
@entity5 has not been able to have the surgery because of health issues , she said			2
despite losing 75 pounds , she said her weight is still too high and surgery would not be safe			2
it 's the same situation for @entity99 , 57 , of @entity100			0
his identification cards label him a female and he had hoped to get surgery so that he can legally identify himself as a male			2
but @entity99 said a prior stroke keeps him on the medicine @entity107 , which the @entity108 warns increases the risk of bleeding and can be a risk during some surgeries			0
@entity115 's ' real name ' policy both @entity99 and @entity5 point out : surgery is also expensive			2
@entity37 said a full genital reconstructive surgery can cost anywhere from $ 5,000 to $ 75,000			2
worse , @entity37 said , @entity36 's language about the kind of surgery it requires to make a legal gender change is n't specific			1
" there 's no such thing as one surgery related to gender surgery , " @entity37 said			1
@entity37 pointed to the fact that some people making transitions choose to do full genital reconstructive surgery , others do what is called " top surgery , " where only the chest area is changed , while others simply take hormone therapy			1
but @entity137 , of the @entity33 - based @entity138 , said he believes that changing your gender on your birth certificate is a completely different issue			1
" this is a record of a particular historic event , " @entity137 said			0
" if you change that record , you are essentially falsifying the record of that historic event			0
" the historic event is that a child was born , " she said			0
@entity5 does n't like labeling her transition as being from " male to female			0
" instead , she believes she was born transgender and is now a female who is " surgically unchanged			0
" " i know who i am , " she says			0
transgender veteran 's documents @entity137 said his organization is against the idea of sex changes as a whole and does n't believe the law should recognize them			0
" the only time we believe you should be able to is , if you can demonstrate medically that the doctor at the time ( of birth ) made an incorrect determination of your biological sex , " @entity137 said			0
" that 's not really what we 're talking about here			0
" some members of the transgender community may be like @entity5 and have driver 's licenses , social security cards and even passports with the gender they display outwardly			2
but knowing that one document exists with a gender they do n't identify with can be psychologically damaging , @entity37 said			0
" if you live as one gender and this one document that you can never change , that lists you in a different gender , that can cause significant psychological harm that i think [ is ] also important to weigh , " @entity37 said			2
@entity36 's @entity186 will allow public comments at a hearing november 17 .			2

proposal would allow transgender people to change birth certificate gender
@entity36 now requires proof of gender reassignment surgery to make change
many @entity199 states allow gender changes on birth certificates without surgery
