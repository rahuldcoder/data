@entity27 was far from the only category of the night , as the awards ceremony honored teen favorites in movies , tv , music and on the @entity34			1
here 's what else you should know about the 2014 @entity1 : 1			1
@entity38 remains the best " @entity40 " actor @entity38 won the @entity1 for best movie villain , and he arrived on stage to show exactly why			1
" you voted me most villainous ? " @entity38 , who plays the calculating president @entity44 in the " @entity40 " series , asked the roaring crowd			1
" i 've been married for 42 years			2
my wife asked me to tell you that she agreed with you			2
@entity49 , on the other hand , do not			2
i think , on the contrary , that i am very nice			0
sweet - tempered , and generous			0
" so generous , @entity38 continued , that he 'd even brought the crowd " souvenirs " from the " @entity40 ' " @entity53			1
and with that , he opened a bag to toss out berries at the audience -- which in the " @entity40 " world tend to be poisonous -- with the warning , " i would n't eat them if i were you			0
@entity63 gets personal when @entity63 accepted her surfboard for the ultimate choice award -- a top prize that in the past has gone out to stars like @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 -- she surprised the audience with an unexpectedly emotional speech			2
" i have to be honest , especially this month , i have to thank you guys , because you remind me -- amidst the stuff that we deal with personally -- you remind me of what 's important , " @entity74 said to her fans			0
" and that 's giving , and loving and caring about each other			0
i 'm not trying to preach ... it 's just that you guys make me better			0
" there was one more thing , @entity74 continued : " i want to thank my mom so much , because she 's the greatest human being in the world , " @entity74 said			0
" she 's strong , and she 's given up her life for me , and she 's so beautiful			0
i want all of you to love your mom and give her everything , because she 's incredible			0
@entity14 is a breakout star on top of the other honors 20 - year - old @entity14 won on sunday , the actor also snagged the choice movie breakout star surfboard			2
" @entity3 , " adapted from @entity104 's novel about a pair of teen cancer patients who fall in love , is just @entity25 's third credited movie role , following 2014 's other hit , " divergent			1
" if you do n't know the actor 's name yet , the @entity1 is telling you to get used to it			2
the @entity113 still have a young audience with @entity115 's " @entity113 " now in its ninth season , you might assume that teens in 2014 would be more interested in watching the newest @entity119 star than the @entity122 family 's escapades			1
but in reality , they 're watching both			0
on sunday , @entity122 joined her younger sisters @entity125 and @entity126 to accept the surfboard for choice reality show , trumping " @entity129 , " " @entity130 , " " @entity131 " and " @entity132 : a @entity133			0
