-- the @entity1 , @entity3 's acerbically arresting fifth feature , is a tasty contradiction : a clear - eyed , empathetic look at people the movie does n't even pretend you can like			1
it 's a true - life drama of @entity12 youth culture gone mad			1
based on a 2010 @entity15 article by @entity16 , the film tells the story of a pack of @entity20 teenagers ( four girls and one boy ) who in 2008 began to break into the homes of their celebrity idols ( like @entity24 and @entity25 ) to steal their clothes , shoes , and jewelry			1
we see them troll the @entity31 to find out which stars are going to be out of town , and they then sneak in easily , climbing over security fences			0
once inside , they basically go shopping			0
they rifle through designer dresses , find roomfuls of necklaces , and get to @entity41 when they reach the sacred chamber where @entity44 keeps her shoes			1
designer pieces worth stealing : 17 picks inspired by ' @entity1 ' the characters are presented as a new species of mutant			0
they care about nothing â € ” nothing ! â € ” but fashion , star gossip , consumer goods , and the way these things mash together to a grinding hip - hop party beat			2
but where a lesser filmmaker might have turned the members of the @entity1 into warped rebels , @entity3 sees that they 're acting out a sociopathic version of the obsessions that now rule far too many of us : they 're the first generation to worship actors purely for being celebrity - endorsement show ponies			1
given what a debased view that is , the clever beauty of @entity72 is its scandalous yet never mocking tone , its refusal to satirize			0
for a while , the girls ' personalities seem almost interchangeable , but that 's part of the texture			2
@entity82 gives the leader a ripe synthetic glow , and @entity85 does a remarkable job of demonstrating that glassy - eyed insensitivity need not be stupid			0
