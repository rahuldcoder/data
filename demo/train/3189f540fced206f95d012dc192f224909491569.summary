-- it was @entity2 who warned his opponents he would " float like a butterfly and sting like a bee "			0
now , perhaps @entity8 can claim similar after crushing @entity9 4 - 1 in the first leg of its @entity12 semifinal wednesday			1
decked out in black and yellow , it swarmed around @entity9 from the start with a buzz and infectious enthusiasm to be marveled at -- but it was left to one man to administer the fatal sting			2
@entity21 , the @entity22 striker , was already one of the most feared forwards in @entity25 football before his took the field			2
he left with his reputation enhanced four-fold , his asking price at an all - time high and his team within touching distance of next month 's @entity12 final			1
his four goals lit up an extraordinary encounter in which @entity8 went from young pretenders to serious contenders			1
barring the prospect of miracles at @entity38 and the @entity39 next week , @entity8 will contest the first ever all - @entity41 final against @entity42 at @entity43 on may 25			1
" it was an unbelievable , " @entity8 boss @entity44 told @entity45			2
" it was a great game by my team			0
it was so difficult today because they are so strong and fast and they are so brilliant on the counterattack			0
" the first 25 minutes were great and then we lost a bit of our game			0
not so much but enough to let them come up			0
" they got ( level ) and at the break we told the players : ' maybe you think there was a wrong decision by the referee but in the last game we had a wrong decision from the referee and we had the winner			0
go back to the strong first 25 minutes '			0
" @entity68 : what would you ask @entity70 ? forget that @entity9 , the nine - time winners and richest club in the world , was expected to qualify for the final			1
forget that @entity9 , boasting the mercurial talent of @entity76 , failed to produce their normal level of performance			1
instead , focus on one of the most exciting and vibrant sides to have emerged in @entity25 competition for many a year			0
the fresh faced innocence , the youthful zest , the unbounded energy , all these traits have helped shape a @entity8 side , which is quickly winning the hearts of football fans across the globe			1
@entity91 football is enjoying a stellar spell in the spotlight with fan ownership , cheap tickets , high attendances and huge television audiences making the @entity99 one of the most popular leagues in the world			2
if @entity42 's 4 - 0 win over @entity104 on tuesday night was supposedly the beginning of a power shift from @entity107 to @entity91 , then @entity8 's dominance confirmed it			1
everywhere you looked on the field , @entity8 was in control			2
@entity21 led the line , a lone warrior refusing to be tamed by a real defense appearing more and more desperate as the night progressed			1
the prodigiously talented @entity114 , who shielded his defense with an authority and maturity way beyond his 22 years , ran the midfield			0
@entity119 , playing just over 24 hours since his $ 48 million move to @entity42 had been confirmed , showed just why incoming manager @entity121 was so keen to lure the gifted playmaker to the @entity123			0
alongside the fleet footed @entity126 , the pair tore into a @entity9 side which looked anemic inside the red hot atmosphere of the @entity129			1
@entity9 would have expected @entity8 to start at breakneck speed , but even it was taken aback by the pace , power and ferocity of the @entity91 side			1
just seven minutes had elapsed when the wonderfully talented @entity126 danced his way through the @entity9 defense , before unleashing a rasping effort which was parried away by @entity138			1
that was a warning of what was to follow and less than 60 seconds later the home side forged ahead when @entity119 produced a sublime cross from the left for @entity21 to poke home			1
the buzz and energy with which @entity8 played appeared to overwhelm the @entity107 champion , which was swept away with consummate ease			2
but while @entity8 dominated , it was unable to add to its advantage and was made to pay as @entity9 struck back with just two minutes of the half remaining			1
with the home players still appealing for a penalty for what they considered to be a foul on @entity126 , the visiting team took advantage in devastating fashion			0
a long ball was misjudged by @entity160 and @entity161 ran clear to square for @entity76 to roll the ball home			2
@entity76 's strike , his sixth in six consecutive @entity12 games , appeared to have left @entity8 in a daze			1
but whatever @entity44 said to his side at the break worked a treat as they produced one of the most enthralling second half displays in recent times			0
it was @entity21 who led the charge , firing home his second within five minutes of the restart after taking @entity126 ' deflected effort in his path			1
his third followed soon after , and when it came , it was worth waiting for			0
@entity185 's cross-cum - shot found the forward inside the penalty area and the striker produced an exquisite turn before sending an unstoppable effort into the roof of the net			0
@entity8 were rampant and the hugely impressive @entity114 almost added a fourth when his fierce effort was brilliantly tipped away by @entity138 in the @entity9 goal			1
that fourth goal was not far away , however , and when @entity196 fouled @entity126 inside the penalty area , @entity21 stood up to power home from 12 - yards			1
not since the legendary @entity200 striker @entity199 in 1960 had anybody scored four times in a @entity12 semfinal or final			2
that tally could have been greater but @entity138 produced another stunning save to push the @entity206 's fierce effort over the crossbar			0
@entity9 did rally late on with @entity76 and @entity209 both going close , but @entity211 's men must now hope for an incredible turnaround next tuesday			1
only once has a team emerged victorious after conceding a three goal deficit in a @entity12 knockout stage			0
on that occasion , @entity216 came back from a 4 - 1 defeat at @entity219 to win 5 - 4 on aggregate courtesy of a 4 - 0 home win			1
" i think @entity8 were the best team by far , " @entity9 boss @entity211 told @entity45			1
" they won every individual battle on the pitch , they were stronger physically and mentally so i think they deserve it			0
how did it go from 1 - 1 to 4 - 1 ? i do n't know			1
" everything happened in a short space of time			0
we lost easy possession and we could n't cope with their counter attack and their transition			0
" we know everything about @entity21 , every detail possible and we lost him in three goals			2
" when we lose and we do n't deserve to lose , with me , it 's a drama , when i do deserve to lose i accept it			0
of course the boy deserves credit for what he did but we gave him every support for man of the match			0
" a 3 - 0 win would take @entity9 through to the final and keep alive its hopes of winning " @entity253 " -- the club 's tenth trophy in the competition			2
but the task looks nearly impossible following its abject showing in @entity8			0
" it will be very difficult in the return leg at home but we must remain confident and try to react , " @entity9 captain @entity259 told reporters			2
" when the draw for the semifinals was made a lot of people thought this was going to be easy for us , but this is a @entity91 team we are talking about			2
they are a great side			0
