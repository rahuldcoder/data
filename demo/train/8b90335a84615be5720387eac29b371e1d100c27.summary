-- remember when @entity1 was the next @entity2 ? or @entity3 ? or even @entity4 ? while that last comparison is still being bandied about -- for better or for worse -- today there is more buzz about " will she stay clean ? " and " can she stay out of trouble ? " than her talent			1
@entity1 's latest 90 - day rehab stint , which ended this week , was taken as an alternative to three months of jail time for two misdemeanor convictions and a shoplifting probation violation finding in march			1
@entity1 the actress seems to have been replaced by @entity1 the perpetual comeback kid			1
and although she has continued to work sporadically , those roles have mostly been of troubled women , not unlike @entity1 herself			2
" at this point , we 're not even sure she 's still an actress , " said @entity23 , co-host of @entity25 's " @entity24			0
" " can @entity1 get sober and have a healthy and happy life ? of course she can			2
but can she be believable as a character that is not like herself ? i do n't know			0
" in " @entity39 , " the new film written by @entity34 ( " @entity35 " ) and directed by @entity36 ( " @entity37 , " " @entity38 " ) , @entity1 plays @entity40 , a woman who has a lot going on -- not least of which is that her boyfriend ( played by porn star @entity44 ) likes to invite other men and women home to have sex with them			1
the low - budget film had difficulties finding a distributor , and the @entity52 documented @entity1 's on - set antics , which nearly got her fired from the film before shooting even began			2
" @entity39 " is set to be released this week via video on demand , and it has been savaged by critics for both the film and @entity1 's acting			1
" @entity1 's performance is certainly terrible , but her steady slide started long ago , " wrote @entity62 's @entity61			1
" ' @entity39 ' has nothing on the awesomely horrendous 2007 ' @entity66 , ' a ultra-campy fusion of art house and crime movie tropes that fell apart in several directions at once			1
" before that , @entity1 made critics ' hit list for her turn as @entity3 in the made - for - television movie " @entity76 , " about the late actress ' love affair with @entity79			1
" @entity1 , who has squandered years of promise and talent as a sullen - faced party girl and irregular arrestee , has been cut so many breaks , it 's difficult to root for her anymore , " @entity80 wrote in @entity81			1
while @entity1 is reportedly doing well post-rehab , her biggest projects do n't quite reflect the work of someone who was once on track to become the greatest actress of her generation			1
instead , @entity1 is slated to open up to talk show queen @entity94 while also appearing on an eight part docu - series chronicling her comeback			2
she 's also guest - hosting for @entity97 on " @entity98			0
" @entity1 ca n't even lay claim anymore to the title of @entity102 's most troubled ingenue , as that role has now been filled by @entity104			2
so where does that leave her ? @entity36 wrote in an essay for @entity108 that he believes @entity1 and the late @entity4 have a lot in common			1
" i think @entity1 has more natural acting talent than @entity4 did , but , like @entity4 , her weakness is her inability to fake it , " he wrote			1
" she feels she must be experiencing an emotion in order to play it			0
this leads to all sorts of emotional turmoil , not to mention on - set delays and melodrama			0
" we call them " troubled , " " tormented , " " train wrecks " -- but we ca n't turn away			0
we ca n't stop watching			0
they get under our skin in a way that controlled performers ca n't			0
" her father , @entity128 , recently told @entity130 news he believes his daughter will be " another @entity133 , " referencing the @entity135 - nominated actor who famously turned around his life and career after several arrests and rehabs			0
" i 'm very , very proud of what she 's accomplished , how far she 's come and how seriously she 's taking her sobriety and her future , " he said			0
but @entity1 has been here before			2
in 2012 , a highly publicized guest appearance on " @entity146 " and shots of the actress dining with iconic director @entity149 led to speculation that @entity1 was on her way to a career resurgence			1
then there was chatter that the actress was " a diva " on the " @entity146 " set , and nothing appeared to come of the chats with @entity149			0
one year later , @entity1 was back in rehab			2
all the public can count on is that @entity1 is willing to take any shot given to her			0
" she is great at making attempts at a comeback , " @entity23 said			0
" is she great at having career longevity ? the jury is still out			0

@entity1 has new projects coming up , but critics savage new movie
a *celebrity* expert questions whether she can pull off *diverse* characters
her " @entity39 " director wrote that she is more talented than @entity4
