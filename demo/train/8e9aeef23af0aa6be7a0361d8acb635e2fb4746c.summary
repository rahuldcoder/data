-- @entity2 world champion @entity1 overcame a collision with a seagull to set a lap record in qualifying for sunday 's @entity7 @entity2 , but will face a new challenge in the race itself			1
due to concerns over safety on the new surface at @entity17 's @entity16 circuit , officials have decided to cut the event to 26 laps and require a mandatory change of bikes for the first time in the history of motorcycling 's elite division			2
the @entity2 website reported after saturday 's qualifying , which @entity1 topped ahead of rookie championship leader @entity28 , that tire supplier @entity30 could not guarantee the safety of its rear slicks beyond 14 laps			1
" every rider will be required to enter the pits and change to their second machine with fresh tires at least once during the race , " the statement said			0
" no rider is permitted to make more than 14 laps on any one slick rear tire			0
" @entity1 , who trails @entity28 by 43 points , needs to finish at least second to take the title race into the final two events of this season in @entity47 and their native @entity48			1
the two - time @entity2 champion will head his 20 - year - old @entity51 rival and @entity53 teammate @entity52 on the front row of the grid , having beaten @entity57 's 2008 lap record on saturday			1
he had set an early leading time despite having a seagull stuck in his front fork after colliding with the bird , but needed to come back after pitting to reclaim pole position from @entity28 with a sizzling lap of one minute 27.899 seconds			1
" i had an impact with a bird on the first few laps on the bike , luckily we could take it off and i could make a second attempt without a passenger -- maybe because of this i went a little bit faster and was able to make pole position , " said the @entity65 , who sealed last year 's title at @entity16 but has only won at the circuit in 250cc racing			2
" i 'm very happy because i pushed to the limit to make the lap and i made a very good time			0
we have some problems with the tire because the new asphalt makes a lot of graining			0
if we can make a good start we will try to get away at the beginning			0
" @entity28 is seeking to become the first rookie to win the title since @entity91 @entity90 in 1978			0
" the goal today was to get a front - row start , and we achieved it , " he said after clocking 1:28.120 and confirming his status as the best overall qualifier this season			0
" we knew that @entity1 and @entity52 would both be very fast over a single lap with the new soft tire compound , something that they showed today			2
" seven - time world champion @entity52 will be on the front row for the second successive race , though he will be seeking to improve on his fourth placing in @entity105 last weekend -- when @entity106 won from teammate @entity28 , with @entity1 third			1
" it looks like in the last races we have found a better solution for qualifying because at the beginning of the season i struggled a lot , " said seven - time world champion @entity52 , who is fourth overall behind @entity106 after returning to @entity53 following a disappointing two years with @entity109 .			2
