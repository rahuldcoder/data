new documents show appointees of @entity3 gov. @entity2 tried to stem other officials ' anger and stonewall media queries about a hastily crafted plan to close access lanes to the @entity9 , closures that wreaked traffic havoc on the @entity3 side of the nation 's busiest bridge			1
in a terse e-mail , the executive director of the @entity17 and @entity3 @entity16 expressed anger for not being told about the lane closures in @entity3 that led into the @entity9			1
he used his authority to override the decision four days after traffic logjams crippled commutes			2
he also expressed concern the lane closures may have resulted in critically slow emergency response time and may have violated the law			1
" reversing over 25 years of @entity33 ( @entity16 ) @entity9 ( @entity9 ) operations , the three lanes in @entity32 eastbound to the @entity9 were reduced to one lane on monday of this week without notifying @entity32 , the commuting public we serve , " wrote @entity29 , the executive director , on september 13 to other @entity16 officials			1
" i am appalled by the lack of process , failure to inform our customers and @entity32 and most of all by the dangers created to the public interest			0
" in his e-mail , which was sent to a number of high ranking officials on the @entity16 , @entity29 said , " i pray that no life has been lost or trip of a hospital - or hospice - bound patient delayed			1
" he also wrote that he believes the " hasty and ill - advised decision violates federal law and the laws of both states			1
" " i will get to the bottom of this abusive decision which violated everything this agency stands for , " he wrote			0
read the documents the revelations are part of more than 2,000 pages of documents released late friday by a @entity66 committee as part of its investigation of top @entity2 advisers , who are accused of closing down access lanes to the country 's busiest bridge as an act of political retribution against @entity32 mayor @entity76			1
the documents also show that @entity2 spokesman @entity79 had dinner with @entity81 , then - director of interstate capital projects for the @entity16 , two days before the transportation official resigned in december over questions around the now - notorious multiday traffic jam in @entity32			1
@entity81 thanked @entity79 for his " sound advice " and the two men later e-mailed back and forth about how to announce his departure from the @entity16			0
in one e-mail , @entity79 said the governor approved the final statement			2
@entity29 was enraged by the decision to close the lanes and his e-mail resulted in many e-mails back and forth between @entity16 officials			2
@entity96 , a @entity2 - appointed @entity16 official who resigned in december over the controversy , replied to @entity29 , saying he was " on way to office to discuss " and that there " can be no public discourse " on the controversy			1
in response , @entity29 tersely wrote , " @entity104 that 's precisely the problem : there has been no public discourse on this			0
" after the @entity29 e-mail was leaked to the @entity109 in september , @entity110 , the @entity2 - appointed chairman of the authority , wrote to another official on september 17 , " i am told the @entity113 ( executive director ) leaked to the @entity109 his story about @entity32 issues â€” very unfortunate for @entity17 / @entity3 relations			1
" @entity110 , in an e-mail on september 18 , wrote , " this is yet another example of a story , we 've seen it before , where he distances himself from an issue in the press and rides in on a white horse to save the day			2
" according to the documents released friday , drivers began complaining about the traffic near the bridge immediately after the lanes were reduced			1
an e-mail to @entity133 bridge general manager @entity132 from an associate described the types of complaints that came in			2
it describes one angry resident who wrote that her husband , who had been out of work for more than a year , was 40 minutes late to his new job			0
the @entity16 is " playing @entity142 with people 's jobs , " she wrote			0
@entity3 officials realized early on that the lane closures had morphed from a traffic nightmare into a major safety concern			1
" specifically traffic conditions required @entity153 officers to remain out on corners , managing traffic instead of attending to public safety issues , " @entity132 wrote in an e-mail on september 9 , as traffic continued to back up			1
@entity132 also expressed concerns about the " inability of emergency response vehicles ... to traverse the borough while responding to emergencies			0
" " @entity32 is not happy , " @entity132 said in another e-mail			2

@entity76 said that @entity16 and @entity3 @entity166 were telling residents of his @entity32 community that he was responsible for the closures			0
" many members of the public have indicated to me that the @entity166 officers are advising commuters in response to their complaints that this recent traffic debacle is the result of a decision that i , as the mayor , recently made , " @entity76 wrote in a september 12 letter to @entity96			2
@entity2 , who has denied involvement in the bridge scandal , apologized to @entity76 in a meeting on thursday after a news conference in which the governor said he knew nothing about suggestions that top appointees orchestrated the gridlock to punish the mayor politically for not supporting @entity2 for re-election			1
plenty in his own party happy to see @entity2 get comeuppance the documents also suggest that @entity81 was aware that there might be political fallout from having helped orchestrate the traffic logjam			1
before he resigned , @entity81 forwarded e-mails about the bridge lane closures in september from his official account to his personal @entity201			1
on one occasion , @entity81 forwarded the e-mails after a member of his staff told him a @entity109 reporter was asking questions about the lane closures			1
he did the same when @entity210 rep. @entity209 sent a letter inquiring about traffic getting onto the bridge			2
the documents also include e-mail messages between top officials of the @entity16 and @entity3 that reveal that another senior @entity2 aide , @entity218 , director of the authorities unit and a member of his senior staff , was aware of concerns the lane closures were not part of an ongoing traffic study			1
@entity29 , the transportation agency 's executive director , wrote a scathing e-mail that expressed concerns the lane closures did not follow protocol and created " dangers to the public interest			1
" @entity96 , the @entity2 - appointed @entity16 deputy director , forwarded the e-mail to @entity218 three hours after it was sent on september 9			1
officials in @entity3 and @entity17 were also angry and shocked that the lanes were shut during a @entity238 holiday , according to the documents			0
@entity240 , vice chairman of the board of commissioners of the @entity16 and @entity3 , e-mailed other representatives on the transportation authority that he was disturbed that traffic was snarled " without regard to this being the @entity238 high holiday weekend			0
" @entity240 was appointed by @entity17 gov. @entity246			0
" this is terribly disturbing and incomprehensive to me , " he wrote			0
" how can a decision like this be made without it being discussed and considered at the highest levels ? " legal woes lurk for gov. @entity2 over bridge scandal the scandal forced an " embarrassed and humiliated " @entity2 to apologize over the alleged political retribution			1

@entity76 , the @entity210 politician allegedly targeted because he did n't endorse @entity2 's re-election bid , said the tie - ups in september caused residents " misery and agony " in his town			1
he met with @entity2 on thursday and told @entity290 that the governor was gracious and that he accepted his apology			1
but @entity76 believes the matter is far from finished			0
an uncharacteristically low - key @entity2 appeared chastened at a news conference before his meeting with @entity76 , and said he was stunned by the revelations			1
@entity2 and his staff originally blamed traffic snafus on a transportation study they said had been mishandled			1
@entity2 said he found out about the more troubling reason for the disruption on wednesday when the e-mails surfaced publicly			2
@entity2 's political star hangs in the balance , with multiple investigations immediately clouding any future aspirations of a presidential run in 2016			2
