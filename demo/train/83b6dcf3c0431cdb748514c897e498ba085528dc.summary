-- as admitted @entity3 leaker @entity2 bides his time , presumably in @entity5 , president @entity1 expresses hope that other countries will follow the letter of the law and turn over the former national security contractor to the @entity11			1
truth is , there are n't many real options for the @entity11 in getting @entity2 back to face espionage charges			1
here are actions the @entity11 could pursue and why they most likely would n't work : demands for @entity2 to return @entity1 risks his and national prestige by directly calling for a country to release @entity2 to the @entity11 and to have those demands fall on deaf ears			1
" it 's dangerous for the president to become overexposed , " said @entity22 , chairman of strategic studies at the @entity24			0
" if he takes a stand , if he makes threats , if he calls on other countries to essentially return something like @entity2 , the problem is he can compromise his prestige , that of the country , and basically be exposed to all kinds of statements about free speech , " he said			1
@entity22 said there 's not much to gain and lots to lose by making a high - profile push to get @entity2 back in the @entity11 to face charges			1
" we have forced him effectively into exile -- there 's not much to be gained from pushing this issue , particularly if you can not be certain of success , " he said			0
" the harder you press , the more you publicize this issue , the more you have effectively put @entity11 's prestige at stake			2
" @entity22 said the effort to get him back may hinge on what @entity2 may know , if anything new			2
" what does he know about sources and methods , which are not really of interest to the media or the @entity61 or the @entity11 public			2
but often very small amounts of information he may have as to how the intelligence community operates can be put in the context of other counter intelligence efforts in countries like @entity70 and @entity71 , " he said			2
@entity2 keeps much of the world guessing extradition while it 's true that the @entity11 has treaties and agreements with @entity70 and other countries , those agreements are n't always followed			1
after the @entity11 charged @entity2 with espionage and revoked his passport , @entity79 still allowed @entity2 to board a flight for @entity70			1
officials later said they had n't been informed that his passport had been revoked			2
" this is much more of a political and diplomatic matter than it is a legal matter , " @entity0 legal analyst @entity84 said			0
" in an ordinary case , sure , you need a passport to get around			0
but here , where this case is causing increasing embarrassment for the @entity11 , governments that want the @entity11 to be embarrassed are only too happy to waive some of the technical legal rules			2
" @entity84 said the matter is going to be decided by whatever government controls @entity2			0
" he is now in @entity70 , a country that has very frosty relations with the @entity11 now			1
he 's thinking of going to @entity98 , to @entity99			0
it 's obvious why he 's picking those countries , because those are countries that have frosty or even worse relationships with the @entity11			2
" so it 's really not a question of the legal -- the legal rights of the @entity11 to extradite him , it 's a question of do these governments want to turn him over			0
he 's in a country that does n't want to turn him over , at least not now			0
and he wants to get another country that does n't want to do it , " @entity84 said			0
interactive : en route with @entity2 diplomacy quiet negotiation between the @entity11 and @entity70 , or wherever @entity2 ends up , is the most likely scenario , experts say			1
" it would probably be that there would be some arrangement through whatever country he ends up in where the @entity11 , through diplomatic means , offers some kind of quid pro quo , some kind of guarantee as to his status and how he will be prosecuted and there is essentially the same kind of implied debt as there is when we exchange spies , " @entity22 said			0
" it has to be taken at the diplomatic level , there have to be quiet quid pro quos , and the more they are kept from the media , the better , " he said			0
that 's probably already going on behind the scenes because there is a better chance of getting @entity2 back from @entity70 than from some of the other countries in which he 's reportedly seeking asylum			1
@entity2 's no - show leaves reporters stuck on plane military action highly unlikely , experts say			1
the @entity11 military could take the extraordinary stop of trying to intercept @entity2 's flight and force it to land or if it entered @entity11 air space , air traffic controllers could tell the pilot to land			1
" that would create a colossal international incident and i just do n't believe the president wants to do that , " said @entity168 , a law professor at @entity169			0
why would @entity2 head for @entity99 ?			0

demands , diplomacy , extradition are among options to get @entity2 back to face charges
@entity70 may be best option ; other countries mentioned have difficult relations with the @entity11
@entity2 flew from @entity79 to @entity5 ; his passport has been revoked
military option of forcing any plane carrying @entity2 to land is unlikely , expert says
