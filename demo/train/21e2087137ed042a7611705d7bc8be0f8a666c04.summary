-- why shoes are called " pumps " and other strange - but - true stories behind the clothes and accessories you know and love			1
so , how did the trend for pointed - toe shoes start ? @entity10 who ? long before they ever made an appearance on the tv show " @entity14 , " pointed shoes were favored by @entity17 nobles , who introduced the fashion to @entity19 on a diplomatic visit in the 1300s			1
the shoes , dubbed " crackowes " or " poulaines " -- after @entity25 , @entity17 -- were so long that a chain running from the toe to the knee was often required to keep them from dragging			1
in 1363 the @entity19 attempted to rein in the look by law , assigning shoe spans to social classes			2
commoners could sport footwear with toes of up to six inches , while those in the royal ranks were allowed a full two feet in length			2
who invented the sports bra ? in 1977 @entity43 student @entity42 was running 30 miles a week -- and her bra was n't holding up			1
with the help of two classmates , @entity42 sewed together two jock straps and -- presto ! -- the sports bra was born			1
the coeds founded the company @entity49 a year later , garnering eternal gratitude from exercise - loving women everywhere			2
almost 40,000 sports bras are now sold annually			1
@entity53 : best bras for every figure is there a real @entity57 behind @entity57 shoes ? not quite : the most widely held theory is that the single - strapped footwear was named for a character in " @entity62 , " a children 's comic strip that was popular in the early 1900s			1
@entity57 was either @entity62 's sweetheart or sister , depending on which source you consult			2
what 's the connection between @entity70 and raincoats ? @entity72 , a water - repellent fabric invented by @entity74 , got its first mention from @entity70			2
the @entity70 used the word in @entity77 to refer to a coarse cloak worn as protection from storms			2
during @entity84 , @entity82 officers on the front lines kept warm and dry in a uniform coat made of the material -- the original @entity74 trench			1
who was the first person known to have pierced ears ? no one knows who originated the style , but there 's evidence that as early as 2500 b.c. @entity98 women wore pierced earrings -- gold half - moon hoops			1
and guys tired of defending their diamond studs can rest easy : men have been wearing earrings since ancient @entity104 , where the jewelry was introduced in 1500 b.c. @entity53 : best way to clean jewelry what was the inspiration for @entity111 's colorful printed dresses ? bored @entity112 socialite @entity111 opened a juice stand in 1959 to pass the time , but she found one drawback : the citrus concoctions discolored her clothes			1
she instructed her dressmaker to create a uniform that would camouflage the bright stains , and the " @entity124 " design -- sleeveless cotton shifts in vibrant prints -- was born			0
the style was an instant hit with customers , who soon began placing more orders for dresses than juice			0
how did pumps , stilettos , and sneakers get their names ? the term pump first popped up in 1550 in @entity19 , where male servants sported the style			0
it is said that the noise they made while wearing the loose - fitting shoes resembled the sound of a water pump			1
the word sneaker entered the language in the 1870s ; the rubber soles made the shoes quiet and therefore " sneaky			1
" the modern usage of stiletto , a @entity153 - era @entity152 word for an assassin 's narrow - bladed knife , made its debut in 1953			0
the word turned out to be especially appropriate , because the shoes ' pointy heels were murder on wooden floors			1
when did folks start toting around umbrellas ? for thousands of years , in such places as @entity104 , @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 , and @entity168 , umbrellas were used exclusively to shade the heads of dignitaries from the broiling sun. ( when it rained , the well - to - do stayed dry in covered carriages and sedan chairs			1
) umbrellas were n't employed in inclement weather until the late 17th and early 18th centuries			0
and another hundred years passed before advances in manufacturing made them lightweight , portable , and available to average joes			0
have bikinis always been so popular ? hardly ! named for the nuclear - testing site @entity186 , the suits first appeared in 1946 , but @entity188 women thought them immodest			0
not until the 1960s were they accepted , possibly helped by the hit song " @entity191			0
" were @entity193 cuffs really created for the battlefield ? it is said that the cuffs were designed to be used as handkerchiefs in combat			0
but , in fact , @entity193 royalty invented the style in the 1500s , when flowing sleeves were the rage ; nobles would tie their sleeves back with fasteners			1
amusingly , the competitive @entity19 tried to take credit for the fashion , which to this day they refer to only as " double cuffs			0
" have women always carried purses ? once upon a time , ladies stored their essentials in a little waist sack tied under their clothing ( sort of an early ancestor of the fanny pack ) and accessible through slits in their skirts			0
around 1800 , thinner , silkier fabrics and slimmer cuts came into vogue , and women could no longer hide the bulging sacks around their midsections			0
the solution ? they began carrying their belongings in small pocketbooks instead			0
why is underwear nicknamed " drawers " ? in the 16th century , drawers became a common term for both men 's and women 's underpants			2
made of linen , the items were no - frills and looked more or less interchangeable ( this being well before @entity243 ever had a secret ; decorative lace trim started appearing on the garments only in the middle of the 19th century )			0
most likely , underwear earned this distinctly unsexy epithet because it describes the way that people put on their unmentionables -- drawing them up and over the lower part of the body			0
