-- the hostage situation at @entity3 's @entity2 has raised four fundamental issues			2
these are @entity7 's thinking on security , its state of preparedness , state responsiveness and the regional security dimensions			2
given the death toll , it is tempting to seek easy answers or adopt quick options , including perhaps withdrawing @entity7 troops from @entity17 or scaling back @entity7 's role in regional security matters			1
@entity7 has no option but to remain the central cog in the struggle to restore normalcy in @entity17			1
there are historical reasons for this -- in addition to the fact that @entity7 defense forces are already entrenched in @entity17			1
for better or worse , history connects @entity7 intricately with @entity31 in ways that are difficult , if not impossible , to separate			2
not only is @entity7 the gateway to several @entity31 countries , some of them are @entity7 's main trading partners			2

as an ethnic group , @entity17 are separated into five different nations in the horn of @entity31			2
@entity7 has citizens of @entity17 ethnicity living in its north east , a historically marginalized part of the country that at one point preferred an irredentist option			1
@entity7 's poorly policed border with @entity17 is over 600 kilometers long			1
some @entity17 are concentrated in @entity58 estate in @entity3 while many others have spread across @entity7 for trade and related purposes			1
given the @entity17 refugee population in @entity7 , it is difficult to differentiate citizens from non-citizens with certainty			1
indeed , since @entity7 defense forces entered @entity17 in october 2011 , north - eastern @entity7 towns have experienced the highest number of attacks from @entity38 -- to which there has been minimal government response			1

over the years , terror networks have borrowed tactics across regions			0
their attacks are increasingly synchronized and @entity38 is no exception to this process			2
this means that the threat that faces @entity7 is real and complex and withdrawal from @entity17 is not an option			1
but can @entity7 's response be different ? the tendency in counter-terrorism action has been to borrow strategies from other places and deploy them locally			0
@entity7 has borrowed extensively from the @entity94 and relied on @entity95 to mount a counter-terror programme in which security is thought of in military and defense terms			1
here , the use of extra-judicial force is preferred and replaces intelligence and surveillance			0
locally , the police still think of security as synonymous with secrecy			0
they therefore never mobilize communities as key pillars of intelligence gathering and community support for security provision			0
@entity7 's main challenge is therefore to address the lack of a visible security strategy and / or policy framework			1
this was apparent in the state of preparedness ( or the lack of it ) and responsiveness to the attacks at @entity2			0
to be certain , @entity7 's security establishment is well organized and impressively presented			2
the problem is the absence of a clearly articulated security vision and policy framework around which its citizens can collectively rally			0
three layers of strategic response must pave the way toward a @entity7 strategy that can potentially deal effectively with @entity38			1
@entity7 needs to think beyond defense or purely military approaches , to ensure coherent and better use of security apparatus , and to mobilize society around a unifying security consciousness			1
read more : @entity38 grew amid @entity17 's lawlessness @entity7 's anti-terrorism plan is heavy with legislative action that anchors the military approach			1
this is important but hardly sufficient because there is an inherent danger in packaging security bills that polarize society into " us versus them			0
" this is the problem that has stalked @entity7 's proposed anti-terrorism legislation			0
civil society and political opposition have contended the proposed law contains provisions that might roll back hard won civil liberties and sanction the profiling of innocent people			0
this view had a valid basis given the arrest and rendition of people to @entity95 where the anti-terror law is more draconian			0
but such extra-judicial approaches simply lead to a dead - end			0
the story of the @entity17 sketched above suggests there is obviously no place to chase " them " away to			0
@entity7 needs to bring its citizens together to recognize security threats , to mobilize them into a common security consciousness and surveillance system that they trust and have confidence in			1
this will require intricate work			0
but @entity7 will not be the first country to think in such terms			0
other societies have lived through decades of terror and collectively mobilized to challenge it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 .			0

@entity7 shares a 600 kilometer border with @entity17 and has many @entity17 *residents*
