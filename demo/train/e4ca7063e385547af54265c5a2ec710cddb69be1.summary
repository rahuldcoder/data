-- several sitting governors might be contenders in the 2016 presidential election			1
@entity4 gov. @entity3 and @entity6 gov. @entity5 have given indications they are thinking of running , although they have n't announced candidacies at this very early stage of the contest			1
@entity3 , a @entity14 , has demonstrated his ability to handle the heat from the national spotlight and he has positioned himself as a tough , northeastern budget cutter who can appeal to moderate @entity14 voters and disaffected democrats			1
@entity5 , a @entity22 , has earned considerable praise for advancing a brand of pragmatic liberalism by championing issues like same - sex marriage , progressive tax reform and rent regulation while also fighting to reduce spending , taking on public unions and reforming government			1
each governor faces some difficult challenges within their states			0
over the past week , @entity5 has watched as a massive political scandal has unfolded within the @entity37 , centering on an official who tried to bribe his way into becoming a candidate in the mayoral election of @entity6			1
the stories coming out of the state suggest the culture of @entity45 might not have become as different as @entity5 has claimed			1
@entity3 also finds himself in the national spotlight after the release of a shocking video showing the coach of the @entity52 basketball team berating and hitting his players			1
the revelation that @entity52 officials knew about this behavior for at least a year has led to calls for the resignation of top administrators at the state - funded university , including the president			1
thus far , @entity3 has backed away from calls to have the president removed , though he has used some tough rhetoric in his comments about the coach			1
other governors are thinking of running as well			0
for example , @entity68 gov. @entity67 , a @entity22 , is gaining some national attention by pushing his state to the left on a number of key issues , including a proposal to repeal the death penalty and the recent passage of sweeping gun control legislation			2
@entity79 , governor of @entity80 , has long been considered a potential superstar for the @entity14			2
@entity67 has received some flak from the right for his fiscal record in the state , while @entity79 's falling approval ratings in @entity80 could pose a big problem for a national run			1
the governors need to handle these challenges with extreme caution and each must make sure that his record as the chief executive of his state , always one of the biggest selling points for governors running for president , does not turn into an albatross that brings his candidacy down			1
in 1988 , @entity101 gov. @entity100 ran for the presidency against vice president @entity103			1
@entity100 started his campaign by touting his role in bringing about the " @entity106 , " the revitalization of the state 's economy around high - tech industries along @entity111			1
at first , @entity14 were worried that his record could allow the governor to position himself as a new kind of @entity22 , someone who understood how to nurture economic growth and whose economic policies offered a model of smart government investment as an attractive alternative to @entity122 's free - market economics			2
but @entity101 , miracle and all , soon turned into a nightmare for the @entity22			2
vice president @entity103 and his aggressive campaign staff found ways to rip apart his record in the state and they used it to defeat him			2
some of the attacks were vicious , taking aspects of the state government 's record and twisting them into devastating campaign arguments			1
the @entity14 , for instance , pointed to a law that @entity100 had vetoed as governor that would have required teachers to conduct the @entity140 with their class			2
@entity100 had been told in no uncertain terms that such a law would be unconstitutional			2
the @entity14 highlighted the veto to paint @entity100 as a liberal of the far left variety			2
@entity103 adviser @entity147 also put together a television ad focusing on a program that a @entity14 governor who served before @entity100 had put into place that granted prisoners short furloughs			0
one prisoner , @entity154 , had killed a man and raped his @entity156 © during his time out of prison			0
the famous ad , playing on racial fears , focused on the program , presenting it as one of @entity100 ' legacies			0
vice president @entity103 targeted the pollution in @entity166 to question @entity100 ' environmental record			1
" two - hundred years ago tea was spilled in the @entity166 in the name of liberty			0
if tea were spilled in the @entity166 today , " @entity103 said , " it would dissolve in the residue of my opponent 's neglect and delay			0
" as economic conditions changed , @entity103 pointed to evidence that the state was starting to falter			0
combined with reports of a looming budget deficit , republicans used the data to challenge the very centerpiece of @entity100 ' campaign			0
in 2012 , another man who served as @entity101 governor , @entity186 , suffered from similar challenges			0
@entity186 's signature legislation as governor , the health care program of @entity101 , undercut some of his ability to challenge president @entity194 on this issue			0
his record of increased " fees " in the state and problems with the economy also became fodder for the primaries and general election			0
the condition and record of their states almost always becomes the prism through which presidential candidates who are sitting governors are evaluated			0
sometimes governors use this to their advantage , like @entity214 in 1992 and @entity215 in 2000			0
but often the states can turn into a problem			0
@entity5 , @entity67 , @entity79 and @entity3 , who still have to decide whether to run , need to handle these challenges with extreme caution			1
if they do n't , they might find themselves suffering the fate of @entity100 , who , like them , was once touted as the most exciting voice of his party			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity229 .			0
