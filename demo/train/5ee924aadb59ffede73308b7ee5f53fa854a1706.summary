editor 's note : @entity2 is the author of a new book , " @entity4 : getting down to the business of @entity6			1
" he provides commentary on @entity10 's " @entity9 " daily from 4 to 7 p.m. et. you can also visit @entity2 's @entity13 blog			2
@entity2 says people are losing faith in their ability to realize the @entity18 dream			1
@entity19 ( @entity10 ) -- there is a chill wind blowing across this land of ours			0
people are losing faith in their ability to realize the @entity18 dream			1
while @entity26 pays out $ 165 million in bonuses to people who arguably contributed to the need for the federal government to hand them $ 170 billion of our money , and while politicians lie about who crafted the language that allowed this kind of stuff to happen ( are you listening @entity39 ? ) , the average @entity18 is seeing his future disintegrate in front of his eyes			1
here are some numbers that suggest we are losing hope : a @entity48 poll shows 39 percent of those surveyed say they 're very confident they 'll be able to keep up their quality of life			1
that 's down from 45 percent a year ago			0
fifty percent of homeowners with a mortgage say they 're very confident they can keep making their house payments			2
again , that 's down from 58 percent a year ago			0
also down are the percentages of @entity18 who are confident they can pay their other debts , things like credit cards and car loans			1
when it comes to saving for long - term goals , it 's even worse			0
only 24 percent of parents say they 're very confident they 'll be able to pay to send their children to college , and only 22 percent of those who are still working think they 'll be able to save enough for retirement			1
this used to be the country where each succeeding generation could look forward to a better quality of life than their parents enjoyed			1
in the meantime , as the federal government continues to print money that is n't worth the paper it 's written on and as our national debt soars past $ 11 trillion , a @entity86 panel is set to recommend that the world ditch the @entity18 dollar as its reserve currency in favor of a shared basket of currencies			2
one of the enduring strengths of the dollar has been that it has always been the currency of choice in times of crisis			0
but that 's not the case anymore			0
our ballooning deficits have driven down the value of the dollar so much that the @entity110 government recently asked for guarantees from @entity112 that the @entity114 bills they own are safe			0
all of this is n't lost on the average @entity18			2
last week there were protests and demonstrations by taxpayers in cities all around the country who are beginning to object in increasing numbers to runaway government spending , taxes , bailouts and our growing national debt			0
these protests were called tea parties			0
has a familiar ring to it , does n't it ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : people are losing faith in their ability to *achieve* @entity18 dream
he says poll found fewer are very confident they 'll maintain quality of life
@entity18 *worried* about paying off loans and sending children to college , he says
@entity2 : idea that next generation would have a better life is now at risk
