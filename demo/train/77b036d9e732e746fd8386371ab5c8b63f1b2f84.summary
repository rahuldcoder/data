@entity0 is at the threshold of a revolution			2
no , i am not referring to the movement colorfully dubbed the " @entity6 " by the international media			0
true , having faced police tear gas and efforts to dislodge them , students and the " @entity9 " group have captured and are holding parts of @entity0 -- main thoroughfares in @entity9 , @entity16 and @entity17			1
they are also demanding the resignation of the territory 's chief executive @entity21 and a back - down from @entity24 on their recently announced plans on political reform for 2017			2
orderly fashion the revolution i am referring to is that of the silent majority , the nondescript middle - aged and conservatives who prefer change in an orderly fashion -- the segment usually ignored by the media and the " haves " of the society as " aging and not sexy			1
" you see , while as many as 70,000 students and " @entity9 " group supporters occupy the streets now , only six weeks ago , 1.5 million @entity45 boldly came out from their cocoons to sign their names on a petition to demand peace and reject " @entity9			1
" that 's one in almost every five people in our city of seven million			2
the campaign was organized by " @entity55 " of which " @entity59 for @entity0 , " a group i co-founded , is a member			0
so are all 1.5 million of us stooges of @entity24 ? hardly likely			1
we are just as diverse and politically divided as any silent majority group in other cities			1
the only difference is we came out before things turned ugly			0
we want peace and democracy -- universal suffrage in 2017 -- but we abhor and reject " @entity9 " for trying to hold @entity0 hostage in the fight for its brand of democracy			1
we believe political reform should be negotiated and then the people can decide for themselves , conservatives and progressives alike			0
after all , the pan-democratic group , which is backing " @entity9 " to the hilt , is holding the trump card -- it has enough votes to veto any reform packages they deem unacceptable in the @entity83			0
unwilling pawns we believe " @entity9 " and its vow to paralyze our financial center by occupation and blockages are for real , and it will hurt the middle class and common folks more than the wealthy			1
we do not want to be held hostage and be unwilling pawns in a political game , and we do not want the same fate as tens of millions in other parts of the world who suffer financial losses , injuries and even deaths in turmoil brought about by the politically aggressive and adventurous			1
now that " @entity9 " has happened , we are feeling the effects of its strangulation			0
the stock market is down , shops are closed , people 's daily lives are disrupted -- and this is just the beginning			1
some say it is a small price to pay for " true democracy " â€” so why do n't we accept it for the good someone else is chasing ? hostages are always told that and then left to suffer			0
but we are not hostages : 1.5 million people have said no already , and we wo n't sit and suffer			1
people are walking up to the occupiers and telling them to go home			0
the @entity55 has openly asked for " @entity9 " to desist from occupation of @entity17 and @entity16 as a show of goodwill to the people			2
the silent majority 's anger and demands are a trickle now , but may turn into a tidal wave			1
the question one must face in a civilized and democratic society like @entity0 , where guns are near nonexistent , is : the will of the majority or the ruthlessness of the minority ? we can not foretell the outcome			2
@entity0 is a divided society now			0
but the minority can not hold the majority hostage , unless they surrender			0
whatever happens , we hope it will be peaceful			0
a social revolution is brewing , and when it ends in success and peace , it may inspire a whole generation of the silent majorities in this world to think : what if we break our silence and control our fate .			0
