@entity0 , @entity1 -- six months after more than 1,000 people lost their lives in the deadliest garment factory accident in @entity1 history , the @entity4 country continues to mourn the deaths of workers in other avoidable incidents			1
earlier this month , at least seven people were killed and dozens injured in a large fire that broke out at a knitwear factory on the outskirts of the capital , @entity0			0
while the cause is not immediately known , the owner of the company said in a press briefing that the fire had originated in the chimney of a heating machine			0
he suggested the way the fire quickly spread through factory was mysterious			0
as always with these incidents , a committee of government officials and representatives from the garment manufacturers ' association convenes to investigate			2
but ultimately it 's never guaranteed that these findings will be made public and corrective measures taken			0
aging safety equipment the knitwear factory , which supplies leading brands across the world , was recently cited for unsatisfactory safety standards , according to local news reports			1
though firefighters told reporters the factory was properly equipped to deal with such an incident , @entity43 , president of the @entity44 , which advocates better treatment for factory employees , said she found out of date firefighting equipment when she visited the site in the wake of the october fire			0
opinion : the bloodshed behind our cheap clothes after the @entity61 accident earlier this year , which left 1,129 people dead and more than 2,500 injured when the entire building collapsed , safety standards at garment factories across @entity1 came under the spotlight amid concerns they had been lax or ignored			1
the incident was an eye - opener for many			2
it led to many changes in the garment sector in the months that followed			1
the country 's labor laws were amended with provisions requiring employers to introduce adequate safety measures for workers , while an agreement was signed by the government and representatives of @entity1 employers ' and workers ' organizations to ensure a more integrated approach to improving safety			1
substandard global brands supplied by @entity1 factories were also moved to take action to ensure suppliers complied with suitable safety standards			1
but in june this year , @entity95 president @entity94 said @entity1 had not been taking steps to " offer internationally - recognized rights to workers in the country , " while announcing the suspension of the @entity101 ( @entity101 ) for @entity1			1
this agreement gave @entity1 duty - free access to @entity95 markets for some items , though garment products were not included			1
one of the biggest issues is compliance , in part due to the shortage of inspectors in @entity1 able to cover the vast number of factories spread throughout the country			1
while steps are being taken to recruit more inspectors , it 's impossible to overlook the failures of the government 's accountability mechanisms			0
this has created a culture of impunity among factory owners			2
the failure of successive governments in @entity1 , ranked in the bottom tier of the @entity127 ( @entity127 ) of global anti-corruption watchdog @entity128 , to curb wrongdoing in the garment industry has created an environment where disasters will happen			1
a sector that started to grow quickly in the 1980s , the garment industry has never been accountable to the country 's labor laws and regulations			1
this is because owners are mostly from powerful sections of society who seemingly did n't bother to follow rules			1
according to one @entity1 media report , 10 % of lawmakers in the national parliament are owners of garment businesses in @entity1			1
according to @entity43 , the number is actually even higher			2
rules ignored the @entity150 ( @entity150 ) is considered to be one of the most influential trade bodies in the country , with links to all of the major political parties			0
but such is the dependence of @entity1 's economy on this industry as its largest export earner , demands to improve working standards and wages are often ignored			1
some labor leaders have alleged that during any crisis in the industry , the body takes the side of owners			1
in the case of the @entity170 fire in november 2012 , the role the @entity150 played in protecting the owner raised many eyebrows			0
the body was criticized for failing to provide a report into the fire , which claimed the lives of more than 100 people			0
despite gradual amendments to labor laws , workers ' rights are still far from guaranteed			0
@entity184 , while welcoming efforts to improve the legal framework , expressed concern that international standards for workplace safety are not being met			1
@entity184 also said the government " has consciously limited basic workers ' rights while exposing workers to continued risks and exploitation			0
" crucially , the provision to punish factory owners in cases of accidents was not properly mentioned in the amended law			0
though the law mentioned that " adequate " measures have to be taken to ensure air circulation , light , drinkable water and sanitation , the term " adequate " is not properly defined , leaving it to the discretion of owners			0
many factory owners still arbitrarily sack their employees as they do not give contracts to them , thus making it impossible for the workers to demand compensation at the labor court			2
@entity43 says most workers in the garment sector are women , so their rights and entitlements are grossly ignored			2
female workers are also frequently subjected to sexual harassment and often lose their jobs so that they can not claim maternity benefits			0
owners fight back factory owners also have their say in this whole saga			0
many i have spoken to said that with such a competitive market worldwide , they simply ca n't give in to the demands of workers			0
they say persistent corruption and political chaos in @entity1 has driven up the cost of doing business there			1
" the buyers , despite our repeated failures to ensure compliance , come to @entity1 as they can get the cheapest rate here compared to neighboring countries , " one owner , who asked not to be identified , said			1
" they will keep on coming as long as we offer this rate and we ca n't afford to lose it by increasing salaries of the workers or ensuring compliance , " he added			2
" this whole industry has grown ... to make profit for both the owners and foreign buyers , " added @entity43			2
" they ca n't think of the workers as their working partners			0
the mentality of the colonial era still exists			0
" with only a few initiatives by the government and no real evidence of the political will to improve safety standards at work , disasters will continue to happen			1
measures will keep being promised without effective action			0
the workers , who keep the economy running , will continue to bare the brunt of injustice and deprivation			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity271 .			2

@entity271 : six months on from @entity61 collapse , conditions for workers remain poor
compliance with safety standards *difficult* to manage due to number of factories
owners of all - powerful garment industry influential in @entity1 politics
corruption in @entity1 very common , according to @entity128
