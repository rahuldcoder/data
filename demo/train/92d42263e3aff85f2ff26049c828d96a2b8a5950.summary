-- gov. @entity2 , we watched as you lashed out at former @entity5 physician dr. @entity4 this week for calling you out about your weight during a recent @entity0 report			1
it 's none of her business , you proclaimed			1
she 's just a " hack , " you offered			1
she needs to just " shut up , " you said			1
governor , you might not want to dismiss her so quickly			1
yes , she has never examined you and maybe it 's not her job to be pointing out the obvious : that morbidly obese men have a significantly higher chance of dying early than the population at large			1
but , still , she was probably doing you a favor			1
how do i know ? seven years ago , governor , i was you			1
sure , i was n't the popular chief executive of a major state and a leading @entity26 possibility for president			2
but , back then , i was busy , with a pretty full life in my own right			2
in 2006 , i was a corporate executive of a major media company			2
i had just helped lead the team in @entity32 , @entity33 , covering @entity34 , an effort that led to @entity35 winning the @entity36 for public service			1
i was the president of the @entity38 , the largest journalism organization of people of color in @entity41			2
and , at 6 feet 4 inches tall and 441 pounds , i was morbidly obese			1
i 'm not going to get into your specific health situation -- you said your numbers are " great " and you were the " healthiest fat guy you 've ever seen in your life " -- and no lay person can speak confidently about the state of another person 's health			1
all i can say is that i and thousands of other morbidly obese men in their 30s and 40s have uttered exactly the same words			1
we have plenty of energy			2
low cholesterol , blood sugar , blood pressure			2
@entity61 , blah , blah			2
then , i ended up in intensive care , on the edge of a coma			2
nearly a decade ago , after having received a pretty decent physical a few months earlier , i was in @entity66 for a conference			2
one morning , i was unusually thirsty , lethargic and tired , and ended up being rushed to the emergency room at the @entity69 in @entity70			2
@entity72 , the doctors said			2
significantly elevated blood sugar levels , too much for the body to process			0
@entity76 , they told me , you were in serious trouble			0
and that got my attention			0
governor , like you , i have kids whom i cherish -- they were 5 and 4 at the time			1
but the doctors told me if i kept going down the path i was headed , i would likely not be around to watch them graduate from high school			0
i certainly did not like hearing that -- thought they were being rude and overly blunt -- but i knew the doctors were right			0
opinion : what you thought you knew about obesity is wrong so , in 2006 , i made a pretty major decision to have gastric bypass surgery			0
and i believe it saved my life			0
since then , i have lost more than 170 pounds			1
now , i 'm not @entity97 - skinny -- i still need to drop another 30 or 40 more to hit my goal -- but i am much happier and healthier			0
and i can now hang with my 11 - year - old son on the basketball court			0
my decision , like yours , was deeply personal			0
but i 'm also a reporter			0
i knew that obesity was the single biggest health risk in this country , and that more than one of every three americans are obese , according to the @entity109			1
for @entity108 , obesity is the largest contributor to deadly complications -- hypertension , diabetes , heart disease , amputation , blindness -- that our community has ever known			0
i knew that the most morbidly obese men who were successful enough to lose 100 pounds or more tended to gain all of it back -- plus another 20 % more -- within five years			1
it was n't that they were lazy or bad or undisciplined			0
it was just plain , biological facts			0
so , at seven years out , i feel lucky			0
now , i am not about to proselytize about such a dramatic move			0
while techniques have improved considerably in the past 20 years , the bariatric option is still a major procedure in which as many as two out of every 100 patients die on the operating table or soon after the surgery			1
it 's still a big deal			0
if i could have been successful with more traditional means , i would have been happy			0
i had tried everything -- the @entity138 diet , the all - juice diet -- and spent more money on gyms , trainers and treadmills than my accountant would approve			0
but , after a lifetime of fooling myself about this plan or that diet -- i could easily lose 30 - 40 pounds at a time , only to have it creep back -- i had to make a tough choice			1
at the end of the day , each obese person needs to choose his or her own path to get down to a more reasonable and healthier weight			1
but the alternative , doing nothing , is a recipe for disaster			0
( how many morbidly obese people in their 80s have you seen lately ? ) for me , it was n't a cosmetic or vanity thing			1
it was a choice i made so i 'd be around to walk my daughter down the aisle or see my son win the heisman trophy			0
gov. @entity2 , you talked about being angry that your kids were watching tv when the doctor said she was concerned you 'd die in office			1
let me tell you something : it 's much better that they hear that and then have you around to explain it to them than have to experience the scary alternative			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 .			1

gov. @entity2 says a doctor who commented on his weight should " shut up "
@entity182 says the governor should not dismiss her *advice* so quickly
@entity182 says he was morbidly obese until he experienced a health *crisis*
he says decisive action led him to lose 170 pounds , which improved his health
