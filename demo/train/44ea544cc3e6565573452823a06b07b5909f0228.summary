@entity0 , @entity1 -- international aid groups were feverishly trying to get supplies into quake - ravaged @entity1 on thursday to prevent the situation from going from " dire to absolutely catastrophic			1
" the search - and - rescue efforts are the top priority			1
" the ability to get people out of that rubble is paramount , " said @entity9 , a spokesman for the @entity10			2
" you have a very limited time to accomplish that before people die and before you start to get into issues of diseases			1
" behind the scenes , a massive coordination effort involving dozens of aid groups , the @entity1 government , the @entity21 and the @entity23 military was under way to get food , water , tents and other supplies to survivors of the 7.0 - magnitude earthquake			1
@entity34 , a senior emergency adviser for @entity35 , said aid efforts were at a " tipping point			1
" " people are without water ; children are without food and without shelter , " he said			2
" what we will see with the lack of water is the possibility of diarrheal diseases and , of course , that can kill children in a matter of hours if not tended to appropriately			2
" it is very possible , " @entity34 said , " that the situation can go from dire to absolutely catastrophic if we do n't get enough food , medicine and work with children and their families to help them			2
" in the @entity23 , president @entity59 promised the people of @entity1 that " you will not be forsaken			2
" " today , you must know that help is arriving , " @entity59 said			2
@entity65 casualty estimates were impossible to determine			2
@entity1 president @entity66 said wednesday that he had heard estimates of up to 50,000 dead but that it was too early to know for sure			2
the @entity1 prime minister said he worries that several hundred thousand people were killed			0
the country 's infrastructure has been devastated , the scope of the calamity enormous			0
" the government personnel that would normally lead these types of responses , they themselves have been affected , " @entity34 said			0
the @entity1 government stopped accepting flights thursday because ramp space at the airport in the capital city , @entity0 , was saturated and no fuel was available , said @entity88 spokeswoman @entity87			1
meanwhile , the pier used for delivery of cargo to @entity0 was " completely compromised " by tuesday 's earthquake , said @entity2 's @entity93			1
three ships filled with medical supplies , food , clothing and water were turned away , he said			1
roads leading into the city from the dock were bucked about 5 feet high by the earthquake , he said			0
relief agencies are focusing on food , shelter , medical care and communications , all of which will help establish a sense of security , @entity9 said			0
" the people will at least know that the world is paying attention to them			0
" supplies and security a bottleneck of supplies has built up while authorities have tried to get @entity1 's main airport functioning			1
rubble - strewn roads , downed trees and a battered communications network have hampered humanitarian efforts			0
aftershocks continue to jolt the region , causing further fear and panic among residents			0
" we 're going to have to wait for this pipeline of aid coming in from various places around the world to be set up and put into full gear before @entity1 can get all the help that they need , " @entity9 said			1
" you 're going to start seeing some progress on that today			0
" while planes were able to bring in the first round of supplies , the question became , @entity9 said , " how do you get it to the folks who need it ? " @entity147 : how you can help @entity1 is n't accustomed to quakes and does n't have the heavy equipment or specialized machinery to help clear the rubble , @entity9 said			1
aid groups and government agencies are coordinating to get the equipment in			1
" it 's basically a matter of clearing out the rubble , making sure that areas are workable , that you have security that can protect these supplies and that you have security in place to help people , " @entity9 said			1
@entity23 secretary of state @entity164 said a contingent of 2,000 @entity23 @entity166 will help the international peacekeeping and police force established after the 2004 ouster of then - president @entity170			0
" we 'll try to support them as they re-establish authority , " @entity171 said			0
the @entity10 emptied a warehouse in @entity177 that had been filled with everything from cooking kits to toiletries to medical supplies and tents			1
that load of supplies is likely to make it into @entity1 on thursday , @entity9 said			1
" our effort is immediate relief and supplies			1
" " the needs are overwhelming at this point in time , " @entity34 said			1
" we are going to be doing our best to respond to that , but obviously that 's a big task at hand			0
" medical emergency hospitals in @entity0 have collapsed , and the few facilities still open ca n't handle the needs of the injured			1
the @entity23 and other countries were dispatching medical supplies , facilities and personnel			1
people who suffered broken bones from falling debris have been unable to get treatment ; there 's simply too many of them			0
" we need medical help , " @entity1 president @entity66 said			0
" some of the hospitals , they collapsed			0
the hospitals , they are full , and they put people in the outside			0
" @entity171 said , " just getting to people to provide the medical assistance they need is proving to be very difficult			0
" see @entity2 's complete coverage of the quake @entity218 , the former commissioner of health for @entity220 , said the coordination between the @entity23 military and groups like the @entity10 is essential to treating the sick and injured			2
" making sure that the right hand knows what the left hand is doing is really , really critical here , so that there is n't further chaos and confusion			2
" @entity9 said officials would assess the situation on the ground and coordinate medical efforts			0
as the days go by , health concerns will grow about diseases , like cholera and tuberculosis , from the thousands of corpses on streets and in the rubble			1
the bodies also can affect the water supply and sanitation			2
" you can have airborne diseases , " @entity9 said			0
" you can have animals carrying [ diseases ] feeding off these corpses			0
" @entity1 could also have a humanitarian crisis since tens of thousands of homes have been destroyed , forcing residents onto residents			1
" there needs to be a place to put people and to set up a structure like a refugee camp , " @entity9 said			0
" that 's all part of this			0
" but he said , for now , the priority is to rescue as many people as possible -- and get supplies in as quickly as possible .			1
