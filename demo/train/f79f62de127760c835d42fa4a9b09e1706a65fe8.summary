-- to look at @entity1 , a statuesque 61 - year - old beauty , one would never know she has conquered both obesity and cancer			1
the ms. senior @entity6 contestant glided through the @entity8 with the humility of someone who underestimates her beauty			1
little did she know , she was about to be crowned ms. senior @entity6 2014			1
@entity1 's platform is one of self - acceptance and self - improvement : " it 's a message to the woman in the audience who thinks ' i 'm always going to be heavy ' or ' i ca n't dance ' ... yes you can , " she said during dress rehearsal			1
while we 're accustomed to beauty pageants featuring women in their 20s strutting in bikinis , the ms. senior america pageant seeks women with " dignity , maturity and inner beauty , " who are older than 60			1
there 's no upper age limit and no bikinis are required			0

the contestants evolved before @entity51 's eyes			2
" most of the ladies have never even talked into a microphone before rehearsals , " she said			0
the granny of yesteryear , sitting in a rocking chair knitting , is a thing of the past if the pageant is any indication			2
today , women over 60 are rocking it on stage : singing , dancing , sharing their inventions and even belly dancing at senior beauty pageants around the country			1
the ms. senior pageants give contestants a chance to do something many of them never dreamed of doing in their 20s , 30s or even 50s -- take the spotlight and share their wisdom and talent with hundreds of people			2
in addition to the crown , @entity1 won " @entity96 " for singing and playing " @entity98 " on the piano			2
@entity1 faced a long journey to get where she is today			2
overweight most of her life , 10 years ago , she lost 100 pounds and kept it off			0
" i decided to enter the competition after a lot of thought and prayer , when i realized that it was an opportunity to reach my dream to touch women across the country , to inspire them to take better care of themselves , and to set goals , dream dreams , and do what it takes to reach those goals , " said @entity1 she wants to encourage other women to become physically fit even as seniors , which is a message she will take to the @entity49 this october at the @entity121 in @entity122			1
" it has been my dream to reach women across the country to encourage them that we ' ai n't dead yet ' ! " said @entity1			1
the second runner - up was @entity128 , a 60 - year - old baton twirler who leads a 105 - person senior citizen baton twirling team that performs in about 55 shows a year			0
the oldest twirler is 95			0
" it 's nice to get together with these ladies because we all bring something very different , but this pageant brings us together , " @entity131 said			0
each of these women has a distinct philosophy , and if laughter is the key to longevity , @entity144 " @entity143 , " will live forever			2
" when i used to date , men used to open the car door for you , " she told the audience in her standup comedy routine during the talent competition			0
" now , i 'm glad if they even stop the car			0
" then there was , @entity154 , who at 81 went from modeling to art dealing to inventing , but believes " the best is yet to come			0
" @entity157 - haired contestant @entity156 is a 79 - year - old @entity159 beauty who still gets carded for proof of her senior citizenship			0
( full disclosure : this lovely lady is my grandmother , and i attended the pageant to support her			0
) encouraging young women to be more confident , she added that , " it 's not who you are but who you perceive yourself to be			0
" last year 's winner , @entity172 , stopped by to encourage the women			2
an ovarian cancer survivor , @entity174 wrote a book , " a @entity176 of @entity177 and how it made me well , " and encourages women to share their inspirational stories , which can come from hardship			0
" you ca n't get through life without having some event that happens that challenges one deeply and emotionally , " she said			0
" as you get to know the ladies , you realize that everyone does have a story and that they were survivors			0
" @entity174 had high praise for 2014 's ms. senior @entity6 contestants : " i came away this year thinking these women all have a lot to offer , so they should all get out there and do something ! "			1
