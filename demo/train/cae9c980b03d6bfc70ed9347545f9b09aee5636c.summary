-- @entity1 officially arrived at @entity2 from @entity3 on friday , declaring he was " honored " to be spearheading the @entity6 club 's hunt for a 20th @entity8 league title			1
the @entity10 striker is in line to make his @entity2 debut in monday 's @entity14 fixture against @entity15 after signing a four - year deal until 2016			1
he has never won a league title with @entity3 -- where his only trophy was a domestic cup seven years ago -- or at his previous club @entity20			1
" i am looking forward to following in the footsteps of so many great strikers , bringing my experience and playing my part to help the team compete for the biggest trophies in the game			0
i ca n't wait to get started , " the 29 - year - old said in an official statement			1
@entity30 , who finished last season as the @entity8 first division 's top goalscorer with 30 goals , moved to @entity3 from the @entity35 in 2004			1
he went on to score 96 goals in 194 appearances , being named club captain last season			0
which clubs will win @entity42 's top leagues ? he had been linked with @entity2 's crosstown rivals , @entity14 champions @entity44 , as well as @entity47 league winners @entity45			1
" in these situations , when you have to make a hard decision in your life , i always listen to that little boy inside me			0
what does he want ? that boy was screaming for @entity2 , " @entity30 told reporters on friday			1
" everyone knows me by now			0
i am quite principled in that perspective			0
it is always difficult to find the perfect match but i do feel this is the perfect match for me			0
if you look at all the players from @entity2 , the stadium and manager , my choice was made very soon			1
" @entity44 's @entity69 acquisition @entity2 manager @entity70 hopes @entity30 can combine with @entity72 forward @entity71 , who finished second behind his new teammate in the goalscoring stakes last term with 27 goals			1
" @entity1 is a world - class striker with a proven record in @entity72 and in @entity80 football , " said @entity70			1
" his talents need no introduction to our fans -- he has scored a number of goals against us in some classic battles with his former club			0
his movement , finishing and all - round ability are outstanding			2
" if you go back six months ago , i could n't see us getting him			0
i thought @entity3 are not going to let him go			2
when i read he had refused a new contract , that is when we acted			0
it has been a long haul			0
" following the recruitment of @entity30 , @entity70 drew parallels with @entity2 's current strike force and the group of goalscorers he had at his disposal when the club won a treble in 1999 , being crowned @entity80 champions and @entity8 league and @entity108 winners			1
" in 1999 i had @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 , the four best strikers in @entity42 , " @entity70 told reporters			2
" we are going towards that now			0
they ( @entity71 and @entity30 ) are two fantastic players and it will be great to have both of them			2
it gives us more strength and more combinations up front			0
" it is a fantastic collection of players and hopefully i pick the right combinations			0
it is great to have a player of @entity1 's qualities to come into the squad			2
" his arrival will almost certainly mean the departure of @entity133 striker @entity132 , who was the @entity14 's joint top scorer in 2010 - 11 but spent most of last season on the bench as @entity136 and @entity137 partnered @entity71			2
@entity3 manager @entity138 will look to new signings @entity140 of @entity141 and @entity143 's @entity142 to fire the @entity144 to a first trophy since beating @entity2 in the 2005 fa cup final			1
" we have regret because we have lost a great player , " @entity138 told a press conference ahead of @entity3 's season opener against @entity149			2
" he had only one year left on his contract and he wanted to go			0
we had anticipated this situation might happen therefore we have bought @entity140 and @entity142			0
" @entity30 may not be the last player to leave the @entity155 this transfer window , with reports suggesting midfielder @entity158 is on the verge of a move to @entity69			1
when asked about @entity158 's possible departure and a potential @entity3 move for @entity164 's @entity163 , @entity138 responded : " both can happen			1
" meanwhile , @entity167 international @entity166 is expected to leave @entity14 club @entity168 , having been linked with @entity169			0
