there 's a scene in my satirical film " @entity4 " in which social misfit @entity5 is asked to write a black culture piece by the editor of a campus newspaper staffed with mostly white people			1
@entity5 accepts the assignment with some trepidation			0
despite the benefit of being black , large @entity14 and all , he feels underqualified , because he has yet to find a pocket of culture he identifies with at the fictional @entity18			1
@entity5 's dilemma is one many black @entity21 share : a deep desire to have an identity rooted in black culture coupled with the knowledge that what 's seen as " authentically black " in popular culture does n't reflect our actual experience			1
we 're left in a sort of no - man 's land , because we do n't often see ourselves reflected in mainstream culture , nor in popular " @entity33			1
" in making the film and engaging in debates about the state of " black film , " here are five things i 've come to know about black culture now : 1			1
there is a difference between black culture and " @entity33 " black culture , sans quotes , is the sum total of cultural contributions to the mainstream by the black subculture			1
it 's a fluid and a multifaceted , often contradictory thing			0
meanwhile " @entity33 " is a lifestyle standard made of assumptions about black identity , often used successfully by marketers , studio heads , fashion brands and music labels to make money			1
it can be the " cool factor " that makes kids line up for hours to spend their last dime on brand new @entity66 sneakers			0
or the thing that makes white people call me " brotha " and blast @entity70 when i hop in the car			0
it 's what people assume about black people and how they should sound , live and act			1
black culture may have been born in black communities , or created by black @entity21			1
but when appropriated for commerce , there is a danger of mistaking " @entity33 " for actual cultural experience			1
that 's where the myth begins , and it can devalue real human experiences			0
" @entity33 " oftentimes employs , but is not always defined by , actual black people often by the time " @entity33 " is being used to sell a product or idea , it 's already been reinterpreted by white people			1
this is n't necessarily malicious , but it 's something to note			2
we are often told what being black is by people who are n't			1
up and coming black hip hop artists are molded to appeal to the masses by white label executives			2
television shows with black characters might have no black writers or directors			2
i 'm reminded of a time in college when a white roommate insisted he was " blacker " than i was , by showing me he could successfully " crip walk			0
" it was a feat i could not do , nor cared to match			0
but in that moment i was made to wonder if i was indeed " black " enough , despite being the only actual black person present			2
in that moment , i felt alienated by a culture i had a need to be rooted in			1
the black experience can sometimes be so concretely defined in the mainstream that it feels suffocating			2
the reality of being black is much more nuanced and fluid			2
black culture is multicultural black culture draws from a variety of influences born both in and outside black communities			1
@entity122 's album " electric lady " demonstrates this : it is a brilliant amalgamation of artistic references as disparate as @entity127 and @entity129 's @entity128			0
being black in @entity21 involves a process of moving through and adopting from many different cultures			2
to define what 's authentically black is virtually impossible , as there are as many ways to be black as there are black people			2
black culture is not proprietary to black people many observers had a tough time when rapper @entity140 won the @entity142 for best rap album over @entity144			1
there is similar discontent over the lack of black artists being recognized or rotated on radio in categories once " owned " by black musicians , like r&b or hip hop			2
but this is not new			0
once communities of black artists birth something to the mass culture , in many ways it is no longer ours			1
for every @entity163 there is a @entity164			0
it can be a tough pill to swallow			0
particularly when a culture we feel ownership over reaches new heights of success in more mainstream , i.e. whiter , hands			2
there is something unsettling about the fact that black artists doing things associated with " @entity33 " ( rapping , twerking , ) does n't seem to capture the mainstream 's attention as potently as when white artists do it			1
( see : @entity182 )			0
personally , i happen to enjoy both @entity144 and @entity184 -- @entity164 and @entity163 -- and even a couple of @entity186 jams from time to time			0
but i do n't define my black experience in something as transient as music or fashion			1
i get much more infuriated when presented with an overtly defined and limited depiction of what being black represents			0
like being told i " talk white " in school			0
or , more egregiously , seeing white kids in college dress as black stereotypes and post pictures of it on @entity201 on a day meant to honor a civil rights icon			0
black culture is a starting point culture of any kind can be grounding and comforting , creating a home for nourishment and rules for understanding ourselves			1
but at a certain point a cultural identity too tightly defined keeps us from growing			0
i 'm grounded in , but not limited by , my blackness			0
when i began trying to get my film made , the confines of " @entity33 " seemed to suggest that if a black movie was n't broadly comedic , a historical epic tragedy or a street story , there would be no audience for it			1
but i made it anyway			0
after millions of @entity228 views for the trailer , and several sold - out screenings at @entity231 , my quirky rumination on race and identity has been warmly received by audiences and critics of all races			0
and that is really the genesis of any culture : ultimately , it 's created by individuals and communities with the courage to do something different and unexpected			0
