@entity0 , @entity1 -- the first distress call from the ferry @entity6 came not from the crew , but from a boy who used a cell phone to contact emergency services from aboard the sinking ship , the @entity1 coast guard confirmed to @entity2 tuesday			1
@entity2 affiliate @entity12 reported that the boy dialed @entity1 's emergency number , telling dispatchers for a local fire service , " help us			1
" the boy 's fate was not clear			2
it was not until three minutes later , the coast guard told @entity2 , that the ship 's crew made a distress call to maritime officials			1
the revelation is likely to add to questions about the conduct of the crew , nine of whom are facing charges in last week 's sinking			1
among other things , authorities have questioned why an inexperienced third mate was guiding the ship at the time of the accident , why so few of the ferry 's life rafts were deployed and why crew members ordered passengers to don life vests and stay put			1
at least 146 people are confirmed dead , according to the joint task force leading the search			1
earlier , when the death toll was reported to be 128 , authorities had said that 174 people were still missing			1
the death toll had been expected to climb as divers were able to reach the ship 's cafeteria , where many passengers were thought to be when the ship began to have troubles last week			1
but early wednesday , the coast guard said no bodies had been found in the cafeteria			1
search for survivors goes on rescuers will continue to focus on the third and fourth decks of the five - level ship , said @entity66 , a spokesman for the joint task force			0
above the ship , two buoys marked its location in the water , surrounded by dozens of vessels , ranging from dinghies to warships			0
inflatable powerboats zipped across the sea , ferrying divers to the area			0
searchers used guide ropes to lead them into the submerged ferry			2
" divers ca n't even see their hands , " @entity66 said			0
@entity83 , one of the divers , said conditions are so bad " my heart aches			0
" " we 're going in thinking there may be survivors , " he said			0
" when we have to come back with nothing , we ca n't even face the families			0
" on shore , relatives of missing passengers waited anxiously , many of them parents of high school students who were on a field trip			0
as bodies come in , they are called into white domed tents to identify the remains of their loved ones			2
authorities said the efforts are still a search and rescue operation , but no survivors have been found since 174 people were rescued soon after the ferry went down			1
captain and crew criticized as the search continues , investigators are trying to figure out what happened to make the ship list before finally capsizing and sinking into the ocean			1
initial criticism has focused on the captain and some crew members			1
@entity1 president @entity119 said monday that their actions were " akin to murder			2
" the captain , @entity123 , has defended his decision to tell passengers to stay put as the ferry began sinking , saying he was concerned about the sea 's strong currents and cold water as well as the lack of rescue ships			2
questions have been raised about why the third mate was steering the ship when it ran into trouble on its way to a popular vacation island			0
the captain was in his cabin at the time			0
@entity140 , which operated the ferry , has posted an apology on its website			2
" we pray for the @entity6 victims who lost their precious lives due to the accident , " it said			0
" we prostrate ourselves before the victims ' families and beg for forgiveness			0
" in recent maritime disasters , captains did n't hang around students remember vice principal who took own life murky waters cloud the horror facing rescue divers @entity2 's @entity159 and @entity160 reported from @entity0 , and @entity2 's @entity161 reported and wrote from @entity162			2
@entity2 's @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 , journalists @entity168 and @entity170 , and translator @entity171 also contributed to this report .			0
