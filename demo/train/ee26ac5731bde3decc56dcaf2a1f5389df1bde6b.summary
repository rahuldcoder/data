acting va secretary @entity0 said he is frustrated and expects to have a plan in place to take " personnel actions " against employees responsible for manipulating patient wait lists at one @entity7 medical center by the end of this week			1
he would n't identify the location of the center , but said it is not the @entity13 facility that has been at the epicenter of a wait - list scandal			1
@entity0 , the top official of the @entity7 , said the investigation process " takes a long time			1
and nobody is more frustrated about that than i am			0
" he added that investigators at the @entity20 are on the ground at more than 70 locations , and he needs to wait for each investigation to be complete before anyone can be fired			1
the investigations came after months of @entity26 reports on deadly delays for veterans waiting for care at @entity7 hospitals			1
@entity0 was put in place temporarily after the ensuing firestorm forced the resignation of the former @entity7 secretary , @entity34			2
@entity0 said he believes the behavior of @entity7 employees has begun to change across the nation , but he wants to hold accountable the individuals responsible for fraudulent practices as soon as possible			1
" until people actually see those consequences i think they still do n't trust it 's a serious thing , " @entity0 said			0
" i want to set the tone			0
" @entity0 spoke to @entity26 outside a hearing before the @entity45 on @entity7 on wednesday ; the acting secretary described an ongoing culture within the @entity7 of faulty scheduling , long wait times , retaliation against whistle - blowers and lack of accountability for the leaders who have perpetuated these issues			1
in order to curb these failures , @entity0 requested $ 17.6 billion over the next three years to hire 10,000 doctors and medical providers , pay for private health care appointments and increase the agency 's infrastructure to meet veterans ' needs			0
" i believe in as little as two years , the conversation can change , " @entity0 said , indicating his confidence that his proposed solutions can transform the @entity7			2
about $ 10 billion of the requested funds would cover the costs of additional @entity7 staff and private care for veterans while about $ 6 billion would pay for new clinics and medical space , @entity0 said			2
sen. @entity75 , @entity76 , challenged @entity0 's request for additional funds , however , noting that @entity79 repeatedly approved more money at the request of former va secretary @entity34 in years past , yet the backlog of appointments persisted			0
highlighting the severity of the issues , the committee 's chairman , sen. @entity84 , i - @entity86 , said more than 600,000 veterans are still waiting at least a month for appointments and about 8,000 are waiting at least four months			0
" what are the legitimate needs ? what are the real needs facing the 22 million veterans in this country ? " @entity84 asked			0
" we have an immediate crisis			0
" the @entity99 has reached out to more than 160,000 veterans to get them off wait lists and into medical centers , @entity0 said , but he added that the @entity7 needs to take drastic steps to restore trust with veterans and the @entity107 public at large			1
sen. @entity108 , @entity109 , said he has called for a criminal investigation by the @entity111 into allegations that @entity7 leaders intentionally manipulated patients ' appointments			1
" i do think that criminal responsibility has to be applied if there was ... destruction of documents , fraud in reporting , " @entity108 said			0
@entity0 told senators on wednesday that he will not tolerate retaliation against whistle - blowers , but a panel of @entity7 employees told the @entity127 last week that the threat of retaliation continues to silence individuals who have knowledge of wrongdoing			2
after @entity34 's resignation , president @entity133 nominated the former chief executive of @entity136 and @entity138 graduate , @entity139 , to lead the @entity7			2
@entity139 will face a @entity45 confirmation hearing next week .			0
