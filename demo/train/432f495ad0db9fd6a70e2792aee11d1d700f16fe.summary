-- whoever is running the social media strategy for the @entity3 needs to be fired because that person has no idea how to follow the rules of social media			1
on tuesday , the @entity3 's @entity10 account , @ @entity8 , asked @entity11 to " tag themselves " in photos with @entity11 police officers using the hashtag # @entity16			1
before midnight , more than 70,000 tweets containing photos or stories of police brutality flooded the @entity21 , replacing # @entity22 as the trending topic by late tuesday evening			0
instead of igniting a positive viral @entity27 campaign , a single tweet managed to set the @entity3 's reputation on fire			2
they should have seen this one coming			0
@entity10 is a great tool to read breaking news , research prospective clients , connect with friends , discuss live events or gain access to your favorite celebrity			2
but it 's a terrible place to try to control a conversation because you simply ca n't			1
social media disasters are becoming a regular occurrence			1
remember the pr executive from media company @entity45 who sent out a racially offensive tweet and raised a firestorm ? or when @entity50 's account got hacked and fake tweets referencing race and drugs were posted ? it 's like rubbernecking an accident on the highway -- we ca n't help but stare and comment before we move on with our lives			1
and while # @entity16 will be largely forgotten by you and me , the @entity3 will feel the pain for months to come			2
rule 1 : every social media platform has a very specific demographic facebook users are a different demographic than @entity10 users , just as @entity68 users are different from @entity70 users			1
@entity10 users are the youngest demographic of all major social media outlets			1
if you tweet , you 're speaking to 18 - to 29 - year - olds , not middle - aged moms on @entity68 and @entity76			0
and those millennials are unforgiving -- they care more about " social expression " than " social obedience , " which means they 'll tweet what they feel with no filter			0
rule 2 : you will never control the conversation on @entity10 tweets are like roaches ; once you spot a contrarian or sarcastic reply , you know there are hundreds more right behind it , and there 's no way to exterminate them			1
if you need to control the conversation , use @entity76			0
on @entity76 , you can delete individual comments that do not contribute to your overall social goal			0
on @entity10 , the users are in control			2
rule 3 : social media is often ruled by the haters social media is a love - hate world , and among your followers you 'll have just as many fans as foes			1
even @entity107 , one of the most dominant brands in the @entity110 , is probably publicly hated more than it 's praised			0
the @entity3 has a well - organized social media savvy hater : occupy @entity113			1
and they jumped all over # @entity16 using the @entity116 @entity10 account			0
in fact , they are credited with making the photos of the police brutality start to trend nationally			0
rule 4 : if you ask people on social media what they think ... they 'll tell you people on social media are ruthlessly honest , way more so than they would be in person			1
ask their opinion about your brand and you 'll get an instantaneous barometer ( the good , the bad and the atrocious )			0
forget the user - generated pr campaign			0
it 's better to monitor your reputation on @entity10 using reputation management software and reply directly to people who tweet bad things about you			2
rule 5 : the odds are not in your favor to get good news despite the overwhelming success of viral positive news websites like @entity146 or @entity147 ( disclaimer : i 'm the founder ) , most content that gets shared online is negative , funny or sarcastic			0
and , unless you request that people tell you their positive experiences , research shows that humans are more likely to remember negative experiences			0
but obviously , there are exceptions , like @entity3 's @entity10 fiasco			2
what 's the moral of this story ? if you want to use social media to promote a brand , either use the rules to pick the right platform and own the conversation or social media will own you			1
@entity3 should have solicited feel - good user generated photos through a contest on @entity76 , @entity70 and @entity68 and then published them on @entity76 where they could delete the negative and sarcastic responses			0
now that you know the rules , answer this question : what do you think will happen if you invite the youngest and most urban demographic on @entity10 ( and @entity177 who happens to follow you ) to post photos of cops in @entity11 ? unfortunately , common sense , safe driving and social media rules are a lot like deodorant , the people who need it the most do n't use it .			1

an @entity3 social media campaign on @entity10 *backfired*
@entity192 : you ca n't control a conversation on @entity10
she says social media is often ruled by haters , and people can be brutally honest
@entity201 : moral of the story is that to promote a brand , you have to know the rules
