-- this week , health care professionals and scientists from around the world met in @entity4 to present the latest cutting - edge research on alzheimer 's disease for the annual @entity7			1
there was a lot of buzz about new studies , including drug advancements that could be potential treatments in the future			0
but for the average patient with @entity16 's , or for their caregivers , it 's easy to get lost in the abundance of abstracts and scientific minutia			1
the ravages of the disease -- memory loss , mood swings , depression and poor judgment , to name just a few -- not only affect the 5.4 million @entity28 with @entity16 's but also the 15 million - plus unpaid men and women who care for them			1
symptoms of the disease can manifest themselves differently in each patient , but ultimately most people living with @entity16 's will end up unable to function independently			1
they will have to rely on spouses , siblings , children , friends , neighbors or paid professionals for help			0
" alzheimer 's disease is really difficult for everybody , and families can really struggle , " said @entity41 , vice president of constituent services at the @entity7			2
if you 're a caregiver for someone with @entity16 's , how can you use the information from the conference ? here are some takeaway messages : the power of engagement @entity52 and social stimulation are key for someone dealing with an @entity16 's diagnosis			1
experts have known for a while that remaining engaged in hobbies or social activities can fend off feelings of isolation and depression , both of which can further the disease 's progression			1
one new study presented at the conference takes this knowledge a step further			0
led by dr. @entity73 , researchers at @entity72 tracked the amount of time 148 patients with mild cognitive impairment and with an average age of 84 spent outside their homes during a period upward of three years from when their activities were initially measured			2
mild cognitive impairment increases a person 's risk of developing @entity16 's but does not guarantee someone will get the disease			1
photos : the past and present of @entity16 's patients in the abstract , researchers found that participants with mild cognitive impairment " had a greater decline in time out of home over time compared to cognitively intact patients			1
" put another way , the people who were cognitively impaired eventually spent more time in their homes than the other participants did			1
more time at home translates to less outside stimulation , and presumably , more isolation and depression			2
for caregivers , this means two things			2
first , it 's vital that a loved one 's engagement in hobbies , social events , projects or community activities does not wane once he or she is diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment , @entity16 's or any type of dementia			1
second , if a loved one becomes withdrawn or starts to spend less time interacting in ways than he or she used to , it may be a sign of a larger problem			0
" this study shows the importance -- from the very beginning of someone 's diagnosis -- of staying engaged , " @entity41 said			2
" it really makes a difference in their cognition and therefore their quality of life			0
" resistance training can improve cognition exercise is one of the more promising things people at risk of developing dementia , or who have been diagnosed with it , can do to affect their cognition			1
but research presented at the conference suggests that not all exercise is created equal for maximum benefit in @entity16 's patients			1
@entity147 of the @entity148 and her team conducted a randomized , controlled trial comparing the effects of resistance training , aerobic activity and balance - and - tone training on cognition			1
eighty - six women between the ages of 70 and 80 were divided into three groups -- one for each type of exercise -- and they worked out twice a week for six months			0
the women who had resistance training showed the greatest improvement on cognitive tests			1
plus , the study found that resistance training " led to functional changes in three regions of cortex involved in the encoding and memorization of nonverbal associations			1
" aerobic exercise improved the women 's balance and mobility and had a greater effect on their cardiovascular health			0
" what that translates to for caregivers is that if a person does n't have an exercise program , this is something to look in to , " @entity41 said			0
" @entity184 " can sound daunting , but @entity41 said that even daily walks can help			0
it 's as much about the physical benefit of exercise as it is about the structure it provides			0
" it will make them feel less overwhelmed , " @entity41 said			0
" if a person gets exercise , we know exercise may help them sleep better			0
the longer that patients can maintain that ability ( to do things for themselves ) , the better for them , their self - esteem and their caregivers			1
" alcohol and dementia do n't mix how alcohol affects the cognition of a person with dementia is n't completely understood , but four new studies presented at the @entity7 shed a little more light on their relationship			1
one study looked at binge drinking ( defined as four or more drinks on one occasion ) and followed more than 5,000 people ages 65 and older for eight years			0
dr. @entity214 at the @entity216 in the @entity217 led the study			0
he and his team found that participants " who reported ( binge drinking ) once a month were 62 % more likely to experience the greatest declines in cognitive function and were 27 % more likely to be in the group experiencing the highest amount of memory decline			0
" binge drinking twice a month more than doubles cognitive function decline ( 147 % ) , and memory decline could increase more than fivefold ( 149 % ) , according to @entity235 's study			0
rare genetic mutation protects against @entity16 's disease those are alarming numbers since patients with moderate or severe dementia can forget how many drinks they 've consumed in a sitting , leading them to binge drink without realizing it			1
if you 're caring for patients in that position , how do you stop them from drinking too much ? since each one is different , @entity41 said instead of stopping the patient , caregivers need to reframe this question by thinking , " what can i do to keep this person safe ? " for example , ensure the person does n't wander off or can safely navigate a staircase , or do n't let him or her drive			2
for patients asking for a glass of alcohol , @entity41 recommends some distractions to keep them engaged so they forget about the drink for which they 're asking			0
when it comes to medication , she said caregivers should learn about the disease so they can anticipate those situations and eventually take over the job of distributing pills			0
caregivers also need to think about how drugs will interact with alcohol : " talk to his doctors -- what medications is he on ? can alcohol get in the way ? you do n't want him intoxicated ; he 's already impaired			2
" @entity41 said one of the first steps to take when someone you love has been diagnosed with @entity16 's or another type of dementia is " to get educated about the disease			1
the more people can plan ahead of time , learn ahead of time , the better you can handle situations later			0
" to help you plan ahead , you can check out a tool from the @entity7 called the @entity16 's navigator			1
caregivers must care for themselves , too " when you 're in a caregiving role , it 's hard to think about yourself , " @entity41 said			2
" it 's very , very common for people to say , ' this is n't about me			0
' " but if you do n't take care of yourself , you wo n't be around to continue to take care of your spouse , your mom , whoever it may be			0
" according to the @entity7 , 15.2 million @entity28 provide nearly 22 hours of unpaid care per person per week			1
that 's the equivalent of a part - time job			2
sixty - one percent of caregivers say the emotional stress of the job is " high to very high , " while 43 % say the same about the physical stress			2
" they 're not getting enough sleep ; they 're not eating right ; they 're not getting enough exercise , " @entity41 said			0
@entity41 said it 's easy for people to lose touch with their social networks or to lose interest in old hobbies when they 're juggling so much			2
that can lead to isolation , which can be just as dangerous for caregivers as it is for the people for whom they 're caring			2
the @entity7 has a 24/7 help line for caregivers with questions			1
the number is 800 - 272 - 3900 .			0

there are 15 million - plus unpaid @entity16 's caregivers in @entity28 , @entity7 says
social interaction can help the cognitively impaired fend off isolation , depression
resistance training helps dementia patients maintain cognition , research shows
the @entity7 has a 24/7 help line for caregivers
