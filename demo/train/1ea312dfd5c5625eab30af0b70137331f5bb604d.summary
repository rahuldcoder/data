a five - year - old ban on the use of trans fats in @entity6 restaurants has sharply reduced the consumption of these unhealthy fats among fast - food customers , a study by city health officials has found			1
in 2007 , the @entity10 , spurred on by the administration of mayor @entity12 , adopted a regulation that forced restaurants to all but eliminate the use of partially hydrogenated vegetable oils and spreads , the main sources of trans fats in the @entity21 diet			1
the ban appears to have had the intended effect			2
a new analysis of thousands of lunch receipts , collected at fast - food chains before and after the ban went into effect , estimates that the average trans fat content of customers ' meals has dropped by 2.5 grams , from about 3 grams to 0.5 grams			1
additionally , the proportion of meals containing less than 0.5 grams — an amount generally considered negligible — increased from 32 % to 59 % between 2007 and 2009			0
" for consumers , the transition was seamless			0
most @entity6 did n't even notice , " says @entity38 , a coauthor of the study and the director of the city 's @entity41			2
" and now we know that it has really made a difference			0
" @entity46 : the 22 worst foods for trans fat the study is the first to examine the real - world impact of trans fat restrictions in restaurants , @entity49 and her colleagues say			2
and it suggests that health regulations at the local level can have a measurable effect on public consumption — an important finding at a time when another pending citywide ban , this one on large sodas and sugary drinks , is generating headlines and controversy			1
the study included fast - food chains such as @entity70 's , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74			2
although the analysis was limited to @entity6 , many of those chains have chosen to eliminate trans fats nationwide as a result of the ban , @entity49 says			1
" it 's a big health benefit for @entity6 , but really we 're looking at a much broader impact , as well , " she says			1
restaurants and food manufacturers use partially hydrogenated oils and fats in baking , frying and food processing			0
( small amounts of trans fats also occur naturally in meat and dairy products			2
) trans fats have been shown to raise " bad " ldl cholesterol while lowering " good " hdl cholesterol , and even moderate consumption has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease			1
@entity46 : high cholesterol ? know the good and bad fats as of 2006 , the @entity103 ( @entity103 ) has required food manufacturers to include trans fats on the nutritional label of packaged foods			2
but because @entity21 eat more than one - third of their meals outside the home , this regulation addressed only part of the problem			0
the @entity6 ban , which was phased in between 2007 and 2008 , was the first of its kind to target trans fats in restaurants , bakeries and other food - service establishments			1
the ban prohibits restaurants from serving foods or using ingredients that contain 0.5 grams or more of trans fats per serving			1
( the 0.5 - gram cutoff is a nod to the @entity103 , which allows foods containing less than that amount to claim " zero " trans fats on their labels			1
) the restaurant industry initially opposed the ban , arguing that eliminating trans fats would be expensive and would alter the taste and texture of foods			1
despite these early concerns , most restaurants were able to meet the new requirements by reformulating their recipes , reducing portion sizes and introducing new and healthier menu options , @entity49 and her colleagues say			0
@entity46 : easy food swaps that cut cholesterol , not taste in the new study , published this week in the @entity148 and funded by the @entity6 and the @entity149 , researchers at the city 's department of health estimated trans fat intake by comparing nearly 15,000 lunch receipts from 168 fast - food locations with the nutritional info for the corresponding menu items			1
at the time the ban went into effect , some health advocates , including the @entity160 , expressed concern that reducing trans fats would lead to an increase in the use of saturated fat , which also contributes to heart disease			1
but that does n't seem to have happened			0
the average saturated fat content of lunchtime meals showed only a slight increase , 0.55 grams , between 2007 and 2009			0
the study provides a partial picture of the ban 's effect , however			2
the researchers looked only at large fast - food chains , which are generally required to publish the nutritional content of their products , so they ca n't say how the ban has affected trans fat content at non-chain restaurants and other establishments			1
@entity46 : 10 states that consume too much fast food the new study comes just weeks after mayor @entity12 announced plans to restrict the sale of sugary drinks larger than 16 ounces in @entity6			0
while the two bans address different health issues — fat versus sugar — the soda restriction could have a similar impact , says @entity199 , a professor of nutrition science and policy at @entity202 , in @entity203			0
the trans fat ban worked because it gave consumers a healthier default option and did n't require them to make a conscious change in their eating habits , @entity199 says			0
a ban on large sodas would accomplish much the same thing by eliminating an unhealthy menu item , although it will still address just one aspect of a much larger issue			0
" the biggest health threat we face is our total caloric intake within the context of our physical activity levels and sedentary lives , " says @entity199 , who wrote an editorial accompanying the study			0
" these changes are just small drops in that bucket , but we have to keep an open mind and try multiple approaches if we want to find more strategies that really work			0

there is a five - year - old ban on the use of trans fats in @entity6 's restaurants
health regulations at the local level can have a measurable effect on public consumption
many chains have chosen to eliminate trans fats nationwide as a result of the ban
