@entity1 , @entity0 -- the score was tied at the start of the game 's second half			1
@entity7 and @entity8 had both scored three goals apiece			0
" i 'm getting so nervous , no doubt about that , " said @entity10			0
he was on his feet with the rest of the crowd in the @entity7 section of the stands , surrounded by a rowdy group of fans who were beating traditional @entity21 drums , banging cowbells , dancing and singing syncopated chants in support of their team			1
just a few meters away , a more subdued group of @entity8 supporters was also standing and cheering , one of them waving a @entity8 flag			0
the two teams had history			0
@entity7 and @entity8 faced each other in the finals during last year 's tournament , with the @entity7 ultimately capturing the championship			0
despite the intensely competitive game , @entity10 was thrilled that the gathering demonstrated a show of @entity21 unity for expats in @entity0			1
" it 's a good time , it 's a time of happiness , " said the @entity7 , who runs an import - export business			0
" it 's an important thing for us to do here in @entity1 , to make @entity21 happy and show that we are all one , that all blacks are still one wherever we are			1
" this is the @entity52 -- an annual tournament held in the heart of @entity0 's largest city , and thousands of miles from the homelands of the competition 's players and fans			1
for a few afternoons in the summer , these games give @entity1 's @entity21 community -- which is n't always made to feel welcome here -- a chance to feel at home			1
and with the exception of the occasional interruption of the call to prayer from a nearby mosque and the line of curious @entity0 watching the match through the outer fence , for a few moments the stadium looked and sounded like a pocket of @entity81 -- especially when the @entity7 players danced , some of them waving their shin - pads in the air , while performing a full - throated song in the crowded locker room before the match			1
" the way the country is , the way life for @entity21 here is -- this is the only place we ever get to come together to have fun , " said @entity87 , one of the @entity7 - born organizers of the championship			2
when he first helped launch the @entity81 cup nearly a decade ago , he could barely raise enough money to rent the field			1
on at least one occasion in the early days , police were summoned to restore order , after the sudden influx of large numbers of @entity21 for a cup game raised tensions with residents here in @entity108 , a working class neighborhood in the center of @entity1			1
women 's football in @entity0 but after eight years , the championship has become a tradition that has attracted sponsorship from local businesses and even @entity0 talent scouts and sports columnists			1
more importantly , @entity87 said the games offer a chance to better integrate new waves of @entity21 immigrants showing up on @entity1 's shores			1
" this competition is a platform whereby you educate the new ones coming not to be involved in illegal things like crime , " @entity87 said			0
" we are concentrated on the community , those who are legal here and those who are not legal ... trying to educate them			0
" @entity0 is a major gateway for migrants who struggle to illegally cross its @entity138 borders and reach @entity140			2
according to @entity0 police statistics , authorities caught more than 32,000 illegal immigrants in @entity0 in 2010 alone			2

how match fixing ruined the beautiful game the majority of the migrants are from the @entity152 , as well as central and southern @entity153			0
while @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 have little trouble blending in with @entity0 society , @entity21 represent a visible and often persecuted minority of the foreign migrant population			1
" there is a sort of double - marginalization that @entity21 migrants are confronted with , which is the discrimination and mistreatment that is sometimes directed at them by local populations , combined with a lack of protection from the police or actual violence that is directed at them by the police , " said @entity161 , a lawyer and co-founder of the first legal clinic to defend refugee rights in @entity1			1
she pointed to the case of @entity178 , a @entity7 immigrant who was shot dead after being taken into custody in an @entity1 police station in 2007			2
stenciled portraits in memory of the slain @entity7 are still spray - painted on some streets and alleys of @entity1			2
a police officer is facing charges of negligent homicide in a @entity0 court , but to date , @entity0 authorities have not convicted anyone in connection with the killing			2
@entity161 said @entity1 's @entity194 marked a success for integration of the @entity21 community in at least one sector of @entity0 society -- football			1
" it is an incredible sense of progress over the last eight years that this tournament has been going on , because it started out with a really scrappy group of guys playing football and it has developed into something that is a very significant sporting event that has been sponsored , " @entity161 said			2
at least one of the @entity0 watching the @entity7 - @entity8 match described himself as a fan of the annual african immigrant championship			1
women 's football in @entity81 taxi driver @entity212 , 66 , said he had been coming to see the @entity21 play for the last five years			1
" sometimes i even watch them training in the morning			0
i like their football and i like them as people , " @entity212 said			0
not all the @entity0 were as enthusiastic about the @entity21 players and fans			1
sound-wise , they make noise and shout in ways we do n't understand and scare small children , " said @entity221 , a 22 - year - old @entity0 university student who watched the match through the bars of the stadium			2
" but their football is nice			0
" like many of the players competing in @entity1 's @entity81 cup , @entity87 , the tournament 's @entity7 organizer , first came to this city with dreams of breaking into professional @entity0 football			1
instead , he found himself engaged in community activism and working for a local company			0
from the sidelines of the match , where he commanded a team of volunteer security guards with the help of a walkie - talkie , @entity87 said he too had been subjected to harassment from @entity0 police in the past			2
" there was a lot of harassment , " @entity87 said , adding " but now things are better			0
