-- a recent warning from the @entity2 about hackers targeting guests ' data when they log into hotel @entity6 overseas was a salient reminder to travelers of the risks to data security on the road			1
the alert , from the @entity2 's @entity14 , was addressed to @entity16 executives , government workers and academics but did not specify a particular country of threat			1
it warned of a spate of incidents of travelers encountering bogus software update pop - ups when they used hotel internet connections overseas			1
when they clicked on the " update , " malicious software was installed on their computer			0
@entity33 connections are particularly risky , said @entity34 , @entity35 security strategist at @entity36 , because they are often set up without proper security settings			1
but they are merely one data - security threat among many facing business travelers			1
from a data - security standpoint , travel is inherently risky , and the likelihood of private personal or corporate data being compromised is greatly increased the moment you hit the road , she said			2
" one of the major ways data loss happens is when people are traveling , " she said			1
" you 're not in a secure area ... that is where the risks tend to arise			0
" see also : why are we still paying for hotel @entity33 ? @entity60 said a major risk was that in getting online while on the road , travelers often turn to free @entity33 internet connections -- in hotels , but also at airports , conference centers and business facilities			1
while security settings vary from network to network , many are left open and unmonitored , and travelers are frequently unaware that they could be unwittingly exposing themselves to data loss by logging on			1
" anyone can connect to them , which means anyone can look at the traffic going across them , " she said			0
" it 's very easy to sit on one of these things and pick up the traffic going through them			0
there are devices out there that let you hijack them			0
" @entity89 , @entity91 's director of global consumer marketing , said there was a growing trend of hackers setting up mock @entity33 hotspots in public places , which appear at the top of the list of available @entity33 connections			1
" people will see ' free @entity6 ' and click on it , and when they do that they open themselves up to great exposure , " he said			0
the best approach is to be wary and steer clear of @entity33 hotspots that do not seem legitimate -- " something ( that ) looks like it 's not quite right , not the proper name they might expect , " he added			2
once compromised , hackers can take total control of a device , including removing all the data contained on it			2
android devices are currently the devices most targeted by hackers , @entity89 said			2
" we saw a 1,200 % increase in malware targeting @entity119 devices just in the first quarter of this year , " he said			2
@entity60 said the best approach for business travelers when using public @entity33 is to remotely log into their employer 's virtual private network , or @entity126 , which ensures all data received and sent from a device is encrypted			1
travelers can also better protect themselves by using encrypted protocols -- simply typing " https : " instead of " http : " at the beginning of @entity132 -- although " https : " is not supported by all websites			2
and they should avoid transmitting sensitive information , such as work documents or credit card details , over public @entity33 spots			1
" i would be cautious of doing anything sensitive on them , " @entity60 said			0
but the risk of data loss begins even before logging on , she said			1
" people forget about the over-your - shoulder problem when traveling , " she said			2
travelers engrossed in their work in cafes , departure lounges or on transport are often unaware of prying eyes around them			0
" most people do n't have a privacy screen on their laptop still , so anyone sitting next to you can look over your shoulder and see what you 're doing			0
" see also : @entity164 's best airport restaurants another common cause of data loss is travelers losing their device outright , particularly when passing through security checkpoints			1
" people put it in a tray and forget to put it back in the bag , " she said , adding that hundreds of laptops are left in busy airports each week			2
for that reason , some companies -- particularly in sensitive fields such as finance , pharmaceuticals and defense -- often issue top executives working with blank travel laptops especially for the trip			0
" when they come back , the company can then analyze what , if anything , happened on the devices , wipe them and reuse them , " she said			0
while the techniques used by hackers could be hard for @entity198 professionals to detect , the best defenses against data loss are surprisingly common sense			1
make sure security updates are completed before traveling			0
keep a close eye on your possessions			0
and , like any traveler , give a wide berth to anything that seems slightly off			0
while there have been major cases of data loss as a result of deliberate corporate espionage , @entity60 said , " there are also many , many instances of carelessness			1
" " wherever you 're traveling , take care of everything you 've got , " she said			0
" people take care of their passport -- you need to take the same care of your information technology			0

@entity2 has warned travelers that hackers are targeting their data via hotel @entity33
@entity231 experts say the risk of data loss is much *higher* when traveling
@entity235 in airports , conference centers and other public places is also risky
data loss also commonly occurs through lost laptops and ' shoulder *surfing* '
