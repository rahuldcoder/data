-- growing up in @entity2 , the common joke was that one day a giant earthquake would tear @entity4 out into the @entity5 and then we 'd all have oceanfront property			1
so we made a lake in @entity10			2
the truth is that @entity4 is n't going anywhere , and , now , as it continues to grow as a political superpower and cultural trend - setter , some people want to figure out just what the hell to do with our nation 's weirdo @entity21 uber - state			1
i say we give it a funny hat			2
but noted technology investor @entity28 has a different idea that 's both bold and arguably insane			1
and he 's quite serious about it			2
@entity28 wants to turn @entity4 into six separate states			1
his initiative , @entity34 , quietly started bouncing around the @entity35 , but is getting more and more attention now that @entity28 's actually moving forward , trying to make his dream a reality			1
i 've been told this phenomenon is called " follow - through			2
" i 'd be inclined to try it some day , but it sounds like it requires effort			2
that said , @entity28 appears up for the task , and he recently shared his big idea with @entity48 writer @entity47 , who reports that @entity28 is " submitting a polished version to the state 's attorney general in the form of a ballot proposition proposal within the next 48 hours			1
" now , that does n't necessarily mean anything			2
theoretically , i could submit a proposal that requires all @entity57 to wear @entity59 t - shirts on wednesdays , but it does n't mean it 's going to happen			1
mind you , it should			2
because it would be awesome			2
the reality is that trying to get an initiative on the state ballot is both difficult and expensive			1
and i just do n't hold the cash to push forward my @entity59 plan			0
however , @entity28 might just have the wherewithal to make the possibility of @entity34 an actual thing			1
but why ? his major argument is that , currently , @entity4 is n't represented properly in @entity73 -- that two senators simply can not speak for the massive population of the entire state			1
additionally , @entity28 argues that creating six @entity34 would encourage more business competition and allow the separate states to make decisions and regulations that are more appropriate to their respective populations			1
" so , uh ... who wants some weed ? " of course , debating , here , the serious pros and cons of this initiative are far beyond my pay grade			0
i mean , i guess it makes sense			0
but , then again , so does the mcrib			0
clearly , i 'm not the man with the answers			0
unless , of course , those answers pertain to @entity97 trivia			0
in which case , i 'm your @entity99			0
i really have no idea whether this would be good or bad , but , still , it 's easy to identify at least one of the major points of debate within @entity28 's plan , which is turning @entity107 into its own state , stretching from the @entity109 to the shores of the @entity111			1
again , i 'm not smart enough to truly understand the actual impact of something like this , but it seems that that particular state might be disproportionately amazing compared to the other five			1
" do n't mind us			0
we 're just going to take all the pretty and successful parts			0
but , hey , good luck with @entity120 ! " in @entity28 's plan , the other five states that do n't get to be @entity107 would be known as @entity122 , @entity4 , @entity123 , @entity34 , and @entity124			1
now , at this point , having shared the basics of @entity28 's vision , i want to go firmly on the record as saying i absolutely , 100 % disagree with this idea			1
it 's simply the worst			0
not so much because of any sound political or social reasons , but because i 'm terribly @entity132 and could n't , even for a second , fathom 55 states			1
this would drive me crazy			0
and what would we do with our flag ? it would be chaos ! that said , i do support cutting the state in half			2
at least so long as we eliminate one of our current states to keep the stars on the flag just as they are			2
in a perfect world , i suppose @entity4 would be divided into two states -- @entity4 and @entity150			1
and then we would combine @entity151 into just @entity151			0
which , as a name , actually sounds quite pretty without the directional prefixes			0
and i 'm sure all seven people who live there will learn to get along as one			0
but more importantly , @entity158 gets to sleep at night			0
and , really , dividing @entity4 is not a completely far - fetched idea			1
@entity28 notes in his proposal that , " voters overwhelmingly approved the splitting of @entity4 into two states in 1859 , but @entity166 never acted on that request due to the @entity168			1
" no matter what happens -- if anything -- it 'll be a while before a vote actually occurs			0
but it 's fun to think about			0
and i bet @entity59 would play the big constitution - signing party in @entity150			0
