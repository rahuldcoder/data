-- every other year in july , the small town of @entity2 in @entity3 hosts the biggest names in the aviation world			1
exhibitors and visitors mingle with the latest technology to hit the skies			0
below , @entity12 editor - in - chief of @entity14 's @entity13 , @entity10 highlights the themes and big players to watch out for at this year 's @entity17			1
touch and go as f - 35 aims for international d√©but costly white elephant , or next - generation , sensor - fused superfighter ? whatever your view of the @entity23 , @entity2 could be the first opportunity for the general public to see the @entity27 's latest stealth fighter outside of the @entity28 that 's , of course , only if the aircraft overcomes a last minute fleet grounding following an engine glitch to fly across the @entity34			1
the @entity12 , as a key industrial and strategic partner for the @entity23 , is set to acquire the fifth generation fighter , in its ' b ' vertical - lift version for the @entity12 's @entity39 and @entity41 's @entity40			1
this @entity12 visit , then , could see an order being placed for the first 14 @entity44			0
while the fighter will wow the crowds with its vertical hovering in the air display , for the military top brass the most exciting features -- including its advanced sensors , helmet display and stealth -- are under the skin			0
should the @entity23 miss the showcase of @entity2 , this will provide extra ammunition for its detractors -- and its absence would be a big talking point			1
one positive point however , for the aircraft 's recent engine fire , is it happened on the ground where engineers can study and solve the problem			0
new contenders while the home team will be riding high -- thanks to the @entity12 government 's support for its r&d and space sector -- @entity2 is truly a global airshow and showcase for the aerospace industry around the world -- with over two - thirds of 1,500 exhibitors coming from outside the @entity12			1
new countries represented this year include @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83			0
while @entity85 and @entity86 continue to dominate the commercial aircraft industry , new entrants will be using @entity2 to show off their progress			2
expect updates from @entity91 's @entity90 -- which will have a mockup cabin for its re-engined @entity94 airliner , @entity96 's @entity95 , whose @entity97 is now in final assembly , and @entity101 's @entity100 -- developing the @entity102 -- a rival to the @entity104 and 737			0
however , one airliner in development that will be notable by its absence at the show is @entity110 's @entity109			0
this suffered a serious engine failure on the ground at the end of may , and although ground - testing has resumed , the aircraft now will miss the show			2
finally , the airshow will also see a new military type from the @entity28 making its international debut - the @entity121			1
the two - seat , jet ' fighter ' is a low - cost attack and reconnaissance platform -- aimed at bridging the gap between supersonic expensive fast jets and slower , cheaper turboprops			2
will it find a niche ? read this : a century of commercial aviation rise of the drones from book delivery by @entity136 drone , to @entity138 and @entity139 's acquisition of ' high - altitude , long endurance ' ( @entity143 ) makers , commercial uavs ( unmanned aerial vehicles ) are now going mainstream -- and this year 's @entity2 will reflect this with a focus on autonomous ' intelligent systems ' and indoor and outdoor @entity143 flying areas			1
civil uavs are now possibly one of the fastest growing sectors in aerospace , with one estimate that in five years , commercial uavs just in the @entity28 could be a $ 13bn industry			2
however , despite the enthusiasm , challenges remain ; in certification , in sharing airspace with manned aircraft and in the business models and structure of this emerging sector			0
so far the majority of activity has been in small @entity143 like quad - and multi-copters -- but the bigger , established global aerospace players are now looking hungrily in the direction of the commercial uav market			0
can they break into this ? or will , in this fast - growing sector , the big primes be outmaneuvered by these tiny start - ups ? read this : 15 ways drones will change your life			2

@entity2 airshow is one of the biggest aviation industry gatherings
international presence is expected to be at an all - time high , says aviation expert @entity10
the @entity23 will make its international debut ; civil drones are on the rise
