editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and website based in @entity7 , @entity8			2
@entity9 is @entity5 's broadband television network			1
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			2
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			2
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- @entity5 visited @entity19 to document the country 's prestigious , internationally recognized film culture			1
it was april 2009 , just a few months ahead of the national elections that sent the country into a series of bloody revolts , clearly the calm before the storm			1
there were no signs that national discontent was brewing			0
instead , there was the sense that the country was ready to dispense with its own personal @entity35 -- @entity36 -- through free and fair elections			1
people would politely smile and shrug when we mentioned his name			0
it was the spring , and the @entity42 had just released their new album that month , and i had " zero " in heavy rotation on my @entity46			0
things were so calm and nonchalant that i even contemplated shooting a music video for the song on the streets of @entity52			1
the idea was to get some local girls to push regular gestures like waving and walking to the point of dance , to see how far we could push dance out into a public sphere , where it would clearly be frowned upon , if not worse			0
pretty cool concept , right ? it was n't until a few months later , after seeing bloody young @entity65 protesters in those same streets , that i realized how risky that music video would have been			0
see the rest of @entity69 at @entity9 @entity19 is a place of many , many rules			1
dancing in the streets in the @entity73 of @entity19 is not something i would recommend			1
lots of things are taboo in @entity19			1
it 's a nation of laws			0
lots and lots of written , otherwise stated , largely assumed , often implied , always religiously motivated laws			0
the country is a curious confluence of laws , divine and terrestrial			1
the country is caught in the grip of a clerical elite that takes its cues as much from the pages of an orwellian dystopia as it does from the pages of any sacred text			2
this is what makes @entity65 film so amazing			2
it is an industry and a culture that thrives to international acclaim and prestige in the face of all of those rules and laws ( or maybe because of them )			0
the @entity65 filmmakers we met on our trip were working under conditions that we simply ca n't really appreciate in our free and freely decadent @entity109			0
one of the most vivid memories of the trip was a visit to an acting school where young @entity65 learned the very idiosyncratic style of acting for the @entity65 screen			0
men and woman should n't touch each other in suggestive ways , like hugging or dancing cheek to cheek , and of course onscreen kissing is strictly forbidden			0
there has n't been a filmed kiss in @entity19 since the revolution			1
but the actors in this acting class were incredibly expressive , huffing , puffing , crying on cue and expressing pain and love and happiness through the cracks in the code			2
watching them , i felt like i was like watching silent film actors of a hundred years ago			1
and i really could n't help but think , what do they think of @entity140 ?			0

@entity19 producing *critically* acclaimed work amid *renewed* passion for film
films offer rare *glimpse* of cultural , individual *diversity* in country
