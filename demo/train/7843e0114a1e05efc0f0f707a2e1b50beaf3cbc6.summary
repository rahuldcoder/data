a trumpeter played a @entity7 - style " @entity6 " as protesters sparred around him in an @entity3 city that 's become the latest flashpoint in the national immigration debate			1
@entity8 will soon house several dozen detained unaccompanied immigrant children from @entity11			2
in the city about 100 miles north of the @entity17 border , word of their impending arrival fueled passionate demonstrations tuesday from supporters who welcomed them and critics pushing for their deportation			1
video from @entity25 affiliate @entity23 showed a man holding a neon poster with the famous phrase inside the pedestal of the @entity30 written with a marker : " give me your tired , your poor , your huddled masses yearning to breathe free			2
" another demonstrator held a sign that said , " send ' em to @entity37 , " describing the @entity39 president with a popular term used for smugglers who help immigrants illegally cross the border			1
" i 'm protesting the invasion of the @entity39 by people of foreign countries			1
this is about the sovereignty of our nation , " @entity8 resident @entity47 told @entity25 affiliate @entity48			2
" you 're just lucky			2
you 're not better , " a pro-immigrant demonstrator shouted at protesters , according to @entity23			1
" none of you are better than them			2
" have you witnessed protests or taken part ? share your images demonstrators who supported the immigrants said they were worried that protests would create a negative national image for their town			1
" we are concerned that @entity8 not be viewed as monolithically anti-immigrant , anti-children			2
we think the angels of our better nature need to be reflected through efforts like this one , " @entity70 , a 35 - year resident who 's also president of @entity72 parish council , told @entity25 affiliate @entity73			2
the face - off is taking place after a similar demonstration in @entity81 , @entity82 , led to vitriolic exchanges about how the @entity39 immigration system is being overwhelmed by a tide of @entity11 migrants			1
the @entity81 protesters blocked three busloads of detained immigrants from entering the town for federal processing			1
the demonstrations in @entity8 come as activists organize a nationwide movement protesting the immigration surge with at least 260 protests scheduled this weekend			1
" we are being invaded ! " says a flyer distributed by 11 groups organized as @entity99 of @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102			2
" our @entity103 is overwhelmed by the massive flow of illegal aliens crossing our border daily			2
" local sheriff worries in @entity3 , protesters were lining up on both sides of a road where the vehicles of detained juvenile migrants were expected to pass			1
protesters positioned themselves to block the road and held " no open borders " signs			2
@entity117 , however , held " bienvenidos welcome " signs			2
@entity121 sheriff @entity120 said he told protesters to stop blocking the road			1
but the sheriff has entered the fray by expressing concern about how the federal government has n't told his agency about the transfer of the detained youths to his county			1
he 's also drawn criticism for publicly revealing the location where the minors are being taken			2
" i believe the public has a right to know , " @entity120 told @entity25 's @entity135 tuesday			1
" i would rather err on that side , rather than to be secretive , as this whole operation was initially done			2
" @entity120 has said he wants the federal government to provide more information about the migrants			2
some of them , he said , may have gang affiliations			2
" my question to @entity146 was , ' give us a sense of the profile of these individuals , ' " he said			0
the @entity152 was recently " informed by ' whistle blowers ' in the @entity39 @entity146 they plan to transfer between 40 and 60 unaccompanied illegal minors to the ' @entity159 ' in @entity8 , " the office said in a statement on its @entity155 page			1
" if you 're going to send unaccompanied juveniles to another state in another jurisdiction , there 's legitimate concern that other members of this community have about public safety and public health , " the sheriff said			1
" give us the information			0
" the @entity172 in @entity8 aims to help young men who may be struggling at home or in school			0
but it 's not where the expected group of immigrant children should go , @entity176 said			0
" these children should be returned to their home country -- not to @entity8 , @entity3 paid for by @entity39 taxpayers , " @entity120 said in the statement			1
" we understand there will be protesters who support and oppose @entity186 ( @entity186 ) bringing the foreign juveniles to @entity8			1
the sheriff 's office will work to ensure the peace is maintained at these lawful assemblies			1
" a mix of poverty , violence and smugglers ' false promises has led to an influx of @entity11 -- including minors -- illegally entering the @entity39			1
tuesday 's protest came a day after the federal government deported its first group of the recent wave of undocumented @entity11 immigrants to @entity203			1
they were about 40 adults and children who had been recently held at a facility in @entity207 , @entity17			0
more deportations to @entity203 , @entity209 and @entity210 are expected soon , the @entity39 @entity146 said			1
not alone the tensions in @entity8 mirror the strife this month in @entity81			0
on july 1 , a wall of angry protesters blocked three buses of undocumented immigrants from entering their community and forced them to turn around			1
demonstrators in @entity81 quarreled with counterprotesters over the country 's immigration system			0
" i just wish @entity11 would be @entity11 again because it 's not , and it 's not just pointed to the @entity223 , " protester @entity222 said			0
" everybody needs to go through the legal ways			0
" but immigration rights advocate @entity226 likened the migration to a refugee crisis and suggested that racial antipathy was motivating protesters			0
" if these children were from @entity234 , we would not be having this interview , " he told @entity25			0
" the parents have had enough			0
they are saying , ' if i do n't send my child north , they are going to die			0
' " a national protest day this weekend , at least 11 groups are organizing what they describe as " the largest coordinated protest against all forms of amnesty , comprehensive immigration reform , and the government 's failure to enforce immigration laws and secure our borders will begin , all across @entity11			1
" at least 260 protests will include demonstrations at state capitols and @entity255 consulates and on freeway overpasses			1
groups in @entity82 , @entity258 and @entity259 scheduled the lion 's share of events			0
among the sponsoring groups are the @entity263 , which describes itself as a resource on illegal immigration ; and the @entity266 , which calls itself " a conservative hub for sharing ideas			0
" their flyer makes strong assertions : " illegal aliens with communicable diseases and conditions such as tuberculosis , scabies , and head lice are entering our country unabated			0
there is a very real security risk to @entity39 from drug cartels , gang members , and terrorists -- all of whom can cross our border with no resistance			1
adding insult to injury , @entity39 taxpayers are being forced to pay for transportation , housing , schooling , legal assistance , and more for the illegals crossing our border			1
" the organizers did n't immediately respond to a @entity25 e-mail seeking further comment			0

@entity303 mayor @entity321 @entity320 also opposed any local agency 's plans to house the youths and blamed @entity37 for the crisis , saying he is " a president that you ca n't trust , you ca n't believe him , " the affiliate reported			1
" we are not insensitive , we are not a bunch of white racists out here , like they like to portray us			0
otherwise , if we did n't care of about kids , we would n't have let @entity332 and @entity333 22 years ago , " @entity320 said , according to @entity308			0
he was referring to the @entity332 and @entity335 , which is a youth program of @entity337 , the agency proposing to house the youngsters , the affiliate said			0
