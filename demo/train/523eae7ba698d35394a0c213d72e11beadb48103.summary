-- after months in hiding , @entity1 was finally tracked down in @entity3 's southern desert by fighters from the western @entity6 mountains			1
once seen as a potential successor to his slain father , @entity9 , @entity1 's capture may mark the end to hopes held by loyalists that the @entity9 family might seize power again			1
as the unrest in @entity3 began to swell earlier this year , @entity1 emerged as one of the regime 's most visible defenders			2
he was the first to address the nation about the unrest and detail a plan to address it			0
@entity1 later made very public vows to fight to the " last bullet			2
" his alleged involvement in the bloody crackdown led the @entity25 to accuse him of crimes against humanity , including murder and persecution			2
it is not yet clear whether he will be brought to trial in @entity3 , as many military commanders would like , or handed over to the @entity25 in the @entity33 , in the @entity34			2
his support for his father , if not altogether unexpected , surprised some who had previously seen the 39 - year - old as the opposite of the elder @entity9			2
whereas @entity9 years ago launched a program to " destroy imported ideologies , whether they are eastern or @entity43 , " his son speaks fluent @entity44 , earned his ph.d. from the @entity46 , wrote an op - ed in the @entity49 and was a frequent go - between in talks with international officials			1
@entity9 rarely went anywhere without an ornate @entity54 tent and wearing distinctive tribal dress			0
the well - traveled @entity1 , meanwhile , was more likely to appear in western business attire : a suit and tie			0
while the father ran the nation , his son 's main job -- at least before his 2009 appointment as general coordinator , a position like many in the nation 's government with few guidelines -- was heading a charity , the @entity71			0
and lastly , while the elder @entity9 was known for his heavy - handed rule in @entity3 and its restrictions on civil rights and more , @entity1 fashioned himself as a human rights advocate and pushed for democratic and institutional reforms that could give more power and freedoms to the people -- at least before the popular uprising			1
yet for all their differences , @entity1 's standing in the world was always defined by his father 's role			1
while some saw the son as more open to change , there was little question -- particularly after the uprising began -- that his loyalty remained first with his father			0
at one point during the war , sources close to the elder @entity9 said that any transition in @entity3 would have to involve @entity1 , long seen as a possible successor to his father			1
he denied having any such desire to rule			0
@entity1 had been on the run since shortly after the fall of his father 's @entity101 in the capital in august			1
his promised fight to the end was finally stopped in its tracks by rebels who had pursued him across the desert			0
his hand apparently bandaged from previous clashes but in good health , his final battle may now mean explaining his family 's actions before a judge and jury			0
responding to news of his capture , @entity119 , the @entity25 's chief prosecutor , said @entity1 had been a principal actor in the violence seen in @entity3 after february 13			1
" he 's arrested , he 's alive , and now he will face justice			1
and that is the most important news			0
" @entity0 's @entity123 in @entity124 and @entity125 in @entity126 contributed to this report .			0
