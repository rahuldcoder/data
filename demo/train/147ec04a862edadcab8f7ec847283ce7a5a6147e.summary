-- three years ago , director @entity1 tried to do prestige , directing an oscar - bait biopic about @entity5 political dissident @entity4 titled " @entity6			1
" it did n't work out for anyone , but at least @entity1 is back where he clearly feels more at home : stylized violence punctuated by surreal chaos			1
in " @entity14 , " @entity13 plays an @entity16 party girl studying in @entity17 who is kidnapped and forced to be a drug mule for an @entity21 gangster ( @entity20 )			2
but when the pouch of mysterious blue crystals ruptures in her gut — following a savage beating — the wonder drug begins to expand her human potential at an alarming rate			0
first , she 's transformed into a sexy @entity31 , out for revenge			0
then she becomes @entity33 , a superhero with near omnipotence			0
and her ultimate destiny , before the high can wear off , might be complete transcendence			0
on paper , " @entity14 " is nothing more than a standard @entity42 action movie , but @entity1 amps it up by going way past the recommended dosage of cinematic insanity			2
the whiplash imagery and frenetic editing give the audience a contact high of sorts — was that a freakin ' dinosaur ? — transforming what should be ridiculous into genuine bizarro excitement			1
he has successfully crossbred the superhero film with the @entity21 - gangster genre , and the film 's car chase through the streets of @entity60 might be one fetishists celebrate from now on			1
@entity14 is a thinly drawn character , just someone who needs to survive , but @entity13 vividly conveys the initial terror of her dire circumstances before shifting into the calculating , almost robotic mode of an alien being flicking away mere mortals			2
by the time the film exhausts itself — in a brisk 89 minutes — it feels like there 's literally nowhere that @entity14 and @entity1 ca n't go , no boundaries , no laws , no logic			1
@entity76 : b see the original story at @entity0			0
