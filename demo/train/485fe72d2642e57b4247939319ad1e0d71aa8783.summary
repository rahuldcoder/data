members of the @entity96 dissident group wondered why @entity6 might target @entity7 , particularly because " there are many more important opposition leaders " in the @entity97 , according to group member @entity100			1
" there are groups who have their own tv stations , groups who lobby in @entity106 , groups who actually plot in @entity6 to do different things			2
not us , " @entity100 said			0
" why us ? " two years ago , @entity110 reported on what local police in @entity112 , @entity113 , said was @entity6 involvement in the attempted assassination of an @entity6 dissident radio broadcaster			1

@entity121 , a former @entity126 expert on counterterrorism , said the fact that the victim lived in @entity22 and traveled widely in @entity21 could have made her far more important to @entity6 intelligence than her dissident activities in the @entity97			2
" you have a 30 - year - old woman who 's spent time out of @entity6 , in @entity22 for example , " he said , " what has she been doing ? was she more active overseas , for example , than we understand here ? the @entity6 intelligence service has a very strong network , a very strong collection network in @entity22 specifically			2

" @entity13 police said they are stuck and will follow any lead , even those involving @entity6 conspiracies , if it will lead them to the killer .			1
