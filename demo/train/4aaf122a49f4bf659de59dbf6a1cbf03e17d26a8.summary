-- the five @entity3 figures who got out of @entity5 in exchange for @entity9 sgt. @entity8 's release would be taking an " enormous risk " if they return to the battlefield , secretary of state @entity1 told @entity0 in an interview that aired sunday			1
" i 'm not telling you that they do n't have some ability at some point to go back and get involved ( in fighting )			0
but they also have an ability to get killed doing that			0
