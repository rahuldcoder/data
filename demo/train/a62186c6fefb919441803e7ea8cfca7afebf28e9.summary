-- when @entity2 introduced @entity3 , the talking , voice - activated " personal assistant " that will come with its new @entity5 , the @entity1 leaped to the obvious , rational conclusion : that it 's a sinister , potentially alien artificial intelligence that 's bound to kill us all			1
" if you 're wondering , ' @entity3 ' can be pronounced two ways : ' @entity11 ' and ' @entity12 , " wrote @entity14 user @ @entity15			1
that 's a reference to 1 ) the computer system in the " terminator " stories that gains self - awareness and unleashes killer robots on mankind and 2 ) the talking , sinister artificial - intelligence system that puts players through their increasingly life - threatening paces in the " portal " video game series			1
to be sure , @entity3 's coming - out party tuesday at @entity2 's @entity31 , @entity32 , headquarters seemed the stuff of science fiction			1
when @entity2 vice president @entity36 asked @entity3 where to find a @entity39 restaurant in @entity40 , a monotone female voice responded that she 'd found five and had listed them for him in order of their customer - review rankings			1

" do i have any meetings friday at noon ? " @entity36 asked			0
" you do n't have anything on your calendar , " @entity3 replied			2
she even knew where he was			0
@entity36 said he could ask her to remind him to call his wife when he left work			0
using global positioning , he said , @entity3 would see when he left @entity2 's campus and speak up			1
but , for anyone who 's ever pondered the inevitable rise of our digital overlords , here 's the real kicker			0
@entity36 asks this simple , if existential , question : " who are you ? " @entity3 's answer ? " i am a humble personal assistant			2
that 's what they all say			0
" @entity3 may be the beginning of @entity11 , " wrote @entity14 user @ @entity75			1
" i swear , if my @entity5 asks me if i am @entity77 ... " that was n't the site 's only reference to the famous scene in which @entity83 , as a robot assassin , hunts for @entity85 's @entity84			2

" of course , some folks go for a more classic approach to menacing , monotone			0
enter @entity99 9000 , the digital antagonist in @entity101 's " 2001 : a @entity102			1

" cute female computer but she talked too much			0
" then @entity99 had an apparent fit of jealousy ( which can not be a good thing )			0
" @entity3 thinks she 's so cool because she has voice recognition but can she lip read ? " @entity99 wrote , a reference to a famous " 2001 " scene			1
" that 's the sign of a truly awesome computer			0

its meaning in the frozen northlands : " victorious beauty			1
" plus ... do we really want to make her mad ?			0
