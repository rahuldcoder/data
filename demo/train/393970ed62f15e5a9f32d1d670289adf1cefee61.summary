but for a few days every year in july , it 's also one of the most important places on the planet to discover the next best thing in the world of fashion design			1
since launching in 2002 , the @entity18 ( @entity19 ) contest has invited students from 70 countries -- spanning a network of nearly 1000 schools and universities -- to compete for a breadth of awards , celebrating not just clothes , but jewelery , accessories and , for the first time this year , art. in doing so , it 's become a ganglion for industry honchos who , if they 're not otherwise adjudicating the awards , can be found trawling the vast exhibition hall for indications of the next @entity40 , @entity41 or @entity42			1
" this is all about young creativity , " says its director @entity43			0
" they 're the future , so of course we must offer them friendship and support			0
" being a fashion event , no one is ever more than a few feet away from a poised camera - phone , and so the highlights are a dish best served on social media ... .			0
