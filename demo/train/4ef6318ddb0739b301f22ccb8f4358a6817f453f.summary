@entity0 -- a series of civil lawsuits against defense contractors @entity5 and its former parent company @entity6 claims the companies endangered the health of @entity10 troops and contractors in @entity12 and @entity13 by unsafely burning massive amounts of garbage on @entity10 bases			1
burn pits produced thick black smoke and toxic fumes , according to plaintiff @entity20			1
six lawsuits were filed tuesday and three more are scheduled to be filed wednesday in state courts on behalf of current and former military personnel , private contractors and families of men who allegedly died because of exposure to the fumes from the burning garbage			1
attorneys for the plaintiffs also are seeking to file a class - action suit			2
the lawsuits are the first coordinated effort by plaintiffs to extract damages for the claimed health effects from the burn pits			1
the military has acknowledged the concerns but said its own test of the most notorious case , the @entity43 air force base burn pit , found there is no prolonged health risk for those who were exposed for a year or less to the fumes			1
but the military 's report on the fumes also acknowledged it can not account for all the items burned in the @entity43 pit			1
at one point the open pit burned everything from plastics and food to medical waste , with jet fuel used as an accelerant at times			2
the lawsuits , filed tuesday in @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 , seek damages " in an amount sufficient to strip defendants of all of the revenue and profits " earned			1
@entity5 and @entity6 were paid millions of dollars to oversee the waste management for the military			2
one plaintiff , @entity20 of @entity78 , @entity64 , said he lived in a tent close to a burn pit while deployed by the @entity81 to @entity82 , @entity13			1
@entity20 's suit describes winds blowing " the thick black smoke and toxic fumes from the burn pit " into the tent where he lived from march 2004 to march 2005			1
the suit claims @entity20 suffered a series of health problems , from severe chest pain and diarrhea , to asthma , sleep apnea and debilitating migraine headaches			1
a lawsuit filed for @entity98 of @entity99 , @entity65 , claims the plaintiff was exposed to " toxic fumes " while deployed to the @entity102 in @entity12 in 2005 and 2006			2
@entity98 lived " less than 50 yards " from the burn pit , according to the suit			2
his suit claims he developed a chronic cough while there that woke him with coughing and choking			0
ultimately he was evacuated and diagnosed with severe sleep apnea and breathing problems			0
according to the filing , @entity98 previously " was in excellent health and physical shape , running six miles every day			0
" in all there are 70 plaintiffs who will file suits , according to lead attorney @entity117			0
the lawsuits filed tuesday and wednesday represent 21 plaintiffs , with an addition 50 or so suits to still be filed , according to @entity121			1
" they sought profit in lieu of safety , " @entity121 said of the @entity5 and @entity6			0
@entity5 had not reviewed the complaints and would not comment to @entity1 on the specific allegations			0
" the general assertion , however , that @entity5 knowingly harmed soldiers or contractors is unfounded , " @entity5 said in a statement given to @entity1			0
" the safety and security of all employees and those the company serves remains @entity5 's top priority			0
" a @entity6 spokeswoman told @entity1 the company had not been served with the suits and therefore could not comment on any of the allegations directly			0
however , spokeswoman @entity142 said if the allegations are in regard to @entity5 activities in @entity12 and @entity13 , then @entity6 believes it has been improperly named			0
" we would expect @entity6 to be dismissed from the suits as @entity6 would have no responsibility , legal or otherwise , for the actions alleged			0
further , it would be inappropriate for @entity6 to comment on the merits of a matter affecting only the interest of @entity5 , " @entity142 said in an e-mail to @entity1 .			0
