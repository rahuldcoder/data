-- @entity2 media on wednesday played up the positives in @entity5 's visit to @entity6 , avoiding mention of @entity9 criticism of human rights but broaching issues of trade and @entity9 discontent with the strength of the @entity2 currency			1
a commentary in the official @entity17 said @entity9 president @entity18 was deflecting criticism of his own domestic political problems by drawing attention to the rivalry over the currencies , but that the @entity9 administration had little heart for an open fight over the issue			1
" when the @entity31 was about to vote on a bill to punish ' currency manipulators ' last fall , the @entity30 put it off with strong words and possibly behind - the - scene political maneuvers , " the newspaper said in a commentary			0
" senior economic officials in the @entity18 administration know that unless all the major @entity43 currencies increase in value , even a drastic revaluation of the yuan would simply mean @entity9 imports from @entity2 would just switch to the other countries in the region			1
" the @entity9 has long called for the @entity2 currency , the yuan or renminbi , to be floated to gain its true value			1
the administration claim that an artificially suppressed currency is unfair to @entity9 exporters , making it cheaper for suppliers to source @entity2 manufactured goods			2
the timing of the visit was not lost on the pro-government @entity60 which said the @entity63 meeting showed all the complexity of a romantic story			0
" @entity2 is a newcomer on the diplomatic stage of major powers			0
it is still unfamiliar with how to use its power and how to deal with provocations from smaller countries , " the newspaper said in an editorial			0
" facing giants like the @entity9 and @entity75 , @entity2 is accustomed to acting with care			2
it never stirs up trouble willingly , instead , when a crisis occurs , @entity2 's first reaction is to seek to defuse tension			2
" a common theme in @entity2 diplomacy and in its official media is that when backed into a corner , @entity2 must pursue its own interests			0
" @entity2 does not need to satisfy the @entity87 at the expense of its own interests			0
@entity2 will not provoke the @entity9 and @entity75 , but it has its own principles to follow , " the editorial said			2
" @entity2 officials should take opportunities to make the world understand these			0
" while the @entity2 also have trade complaints against the @entity9 , in particular @entity9 export controls on high - tech exports , there was no mention of issues that have seen @entity2 excluded from @entity9 preferential trade right status			1
similarly , there was little mention of @entity9 criticism of @entity2 's human rights record or its position on @entity106 , both of them sticking point in @entity2 - @entity9 relations			1
@entity5 -- who is being groomed for the @entity2 presidency - is the highest - ranking @entity2 official to visit since @entity18 launched a new @entity9 policy in @entity43 in november designed to reassert its influence in the @entity115			1
@entity116 has expressed misgiving about the @entity9 " pivot " which is pushing for a new free - trade agreement with at least eight countries in the @entity43 region and has secured military basing rights in @entity123 .			0
