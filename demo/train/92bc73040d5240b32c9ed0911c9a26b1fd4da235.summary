@entity0 -- a strong earthquake in @entity3 shut down a nearby nuclear power plant tuesday afternoon and sent out seismic waves felt by millions from @entity6 to northern @entity7			1
three aftershocks were reported by tuesday evening			1
no major injuries or extensive damage were reported after the 5.8 - magnitude earthquake , which struck about 40 miles northwest of @entity12			1
the quake prompted evacuations of office buildings and the precautionary closing of monuments in the nation 's capital			1
a surge in calls by cell - phone users after the event affected service in many areas , federal officials said			1
aftershocks of magnitude 2.8 and 2.2 were recorded later in the afternoon , followed by one of 4.2 just after 8 p.m. et , officials said			2
more aftershocks are possible in the coming weeks			2
" it 's one of the largest that we 've had there , " @entity33 seismologist @entity32 said of the quake			2
most federal buildings in @entity0 had reopened by late tuesday afternoon , but officials were taking all precautions before giving the all - clear to some of its most iconic structures			1
the @entity47 @entity46 was cleared for employees to come back to get their belongings , but inspectors asked people to limit their time inside the building while engineers continue to work around the complex			2
a helicopter inspected the @entity58 , and it was found to be structurally sound , the @entity56 said			2
but a secondary inspection revealed cracking in the stones at the top of the monument			2
structural engineers on wednesday will determine the best way to repair the monument before it is reopened , the agency said			2
the grounds have been reopened except for an area about 100 feet outside the plaza			2
@entity47 @entity71 spokesman @entity70 said to his eye , the monument was " clearly not leaning			2
it 's standing tall and proud			2
" the @entity76 and @entity77 memorials reopened tuesday evening			1
witnesses reported a number of buildings were evacuated as far away as @entity81 and @entity82 , where a 5.8 earthquake struck in 1944			1
the quake , which was recorded at 1:51 p.m. , was shallow -- just 3.7 miles deep -- and located 88 miles southwest of @entity0 near the town of @entity86 , @entity3			1
the magnitude was initially reported as 5.8 , then revised to 5.9 , and then revised again back to 5.8			1
with so many on the @entity90 unaccustomed to earthquakes , many people were left wondering whether all that rumbling could have been caused by a truck , helicopter , an explosion or some other force			2
@entity97 was in an office building elevator in @entity99 , alone , when the shaking started			2
" i have never felt a quake before			0
it was scary having no idea what the cause was , " she said			0
" i felt the vibrations and the elevator stopped for a period of about five minutes			0
" the earthquake triggered the automatic shutdown of a nuclear power plant less than 20 miles from the epicenter after it lost electricity			0
the quake signaled " unusual events " at 12 other nuclear facilities across the @entity90 and @entity118 , @entity47 authorities reported			1
@entity120 said both reactors at its @entity123 plant shut down after the first tremors			0
@entity125 said the plant vented steam , but there was no release of radioactive material			0
@entity131 , senior vice president of nuclear operations for @entity120 , said there was no damage to the spent fuel pool			0
officials were restoring full power to the site , which was operating on diesel generators			1
@entity131 said that might happen by late tuesday , but that was before the evening aftershock			0
the @entity142 was monitoring the plant			0
relatively minor damage was reported in a few @entity3 counties , including @entity146 , nearest to the epicenter			1
several school buildings had damage , as did town hall buildings , @entity146 spokeswoman @entity125 told @entity1			1
an unspecified number of minor injuries were reported in the county			1
@entity154 , a resident of @entity86 in @entity146 , said the quake arrived with a rumbling " that sounded like a train coming to a stop			1
" it knocked down two chimneys on the converted 1900 - vintage home that now houses her parcel - shipping business			0
tuesday 's incident occurred in a known seismic zone in central @entity3 , said @entity166 of the @entity33			1
but the strength of the earthquake was a bit surprising			0
a 5.9 event occurred in 1897 near @entity172 , he said			0
at @entity0 's @entity174 , spokesman @entity173 said three 5 - to 8 - foot pinnacles had broken from the central tower			1
he said stone masons and engineers would assess the damage , which also included other pieces that broke and fell on the surrounding lawn			0
the building was evacuated and closed to the public			0
@entity184 , the secretary of the @entity185 , said the national museum 's landmark castle on the @entity188 had cracks in interior walls			0
there was no immediate indication of structural damage , but the 150 - year - old building will need closer examination , he said			0
" you want to do an inspection to be sure about that , " @entity184 said			0
@entity184 , who 's also an earthquake engineer , said the geography of the @entity90 helped transmit the shock from the @entity201 to @entity7			0
the underlying bedrock is largely a solid sheet , " so you get a lot more travel out of earthquake waves than you would in @entity207 , " he said			0
those waves extended to downtown @entity82 , where court buildings were evacuated			1
" i was trying to figure out what was going on , like everyone else , " said manhattan district attorney @entity210 , who said he had been through many earthquakes when he lived in @entity207			0
mayor @entity214 said at an afternoon news conference that the earthquake was felt " across the five boroughs " of the city , but there were no reports of injuries and " virtually no reports of damage			1
" the quake was also reported to have been felt on the island of @entity226 , where president @entity227 was playing golf			1
he did not feel the earthquake , according to the @entity231			0
the earthquake slowed but did n't halt major transportation services			2
service at major airports throughout the region was disrupted , but all were reported to have resumed normal operations about 75 minutes after the earthquake struck			1
at @entity243 and @entity244 , control towers were evacuated , the @entity240 and @entity241 said			0
@entity245 on tuesday evening said service between @entity0 and @entity247 had returned to normal speeds following inspections			1
in @entity251 , @entity3 , @entity250 said she was spooked and staying outside for the moment			1
" i used to live in @entity207 , so i know shaking and this felt big , " she said			0
" i grabbed my dog and raced outside ; my first thought is always that the furnace might explode or a cabinet crashes down on top of us			0
" @entity1 's @entity260 , @entity261 , @entity262 , @entity263 , @entity264 , @entity265 , @entity266 , @entity267 , @entity268 , @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity271 , @entity272 , @entity273 and @entity274 contributed to this report .			0
