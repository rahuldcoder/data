-- @entity1 has another hit on her hands ? it must be tuesday			1
at midnight , the 24 - year - old pop star released a new track cowritten with fun			1
's @entity8 called " @entity10 , " and it 's skyrocketed to no. 1			1
it 's the second release from her upcoming album , " 1989 , " and like other @entity1 songs delves into personal territory			1
" this song is about the fragility and breakable nature of some relationships , " @entity1 explained to " @entity16 " on monday , probably prompting speculation as to which of her ex-boyfriends she could be writing about ( early buzz points to @entity22 's @entity21 )			1
" this was a relationship where -- it was kind of ( like ) living day - to - day , wondering where it was going , if it was going anywhere , if it was going to end the next day , " @entity1 recalled			1
" it was a relationship where you kind of never feel like you 're standing on solid ground			0
that kind of feeling brings on excitement but also extreme anxiety , and kind of a frantic feeling of wondering			0
... this song sounds exactly like that frantic feeling of anxiety and questioning			2
" we can actually hear @entity1 's critics rolling their eyes			1
but here 's one of the best things about the star : even when she 's mocked for writing thinly veiled songs about her love life or criticized for going completely pop and not sticking to her country roots , @entity1 still follows her own path			1
this is a woman who will tell her record label , when instructed not to venture too far off in a new direction , sorry , " but this is how it 's going to be			2
" she knows what she wants			0
she knows who she is			0
and if you do n't like it , she 'll just shake off the criticism and write a song about doing so that you secretly wo n't be able to stop singing			2
that 's pretty gutsy in an industry that 's running scared			0
here are five other reasons why you ca n't help but like @entity1 , even if you 're not a fan : 1			1
the catch factor have you ever caught yourself singing a catchy ditty and not even remembering how you know the lyrics ? it was probably a @entity1 track			1
her music has a way of permeating every facet of popular culture , to the point that you do n't have to buy her albums to recognize the twang from " @entity85 " or sing the hook from " @entity87			0
seven @entity89 later , still more likely to be found baking with cats @entity1 is one of the most recognizable pop stars on the planet , and we can only imagine the access that kind of fame can yield			1
we would not be at all surprised if the singer could jet from @entity99 to @entity100 in the blink of an eye in a private jet with seats lined in mink			0
but instead of the usual shenanigans you hear about from the very young , privileged and wealthy , @entity1 is more likely to be found baking cookies or playing with a new kitten			2
in other words , probably the exact same things she 'd be doing if she were n't famous , which is a rare thing to witness			0
she obsesses over the same tv shows speaking of those cats , one of them is named @entity117 , as in one of the starring detectives on " @entity120 : @entity121			0
" another one of the star 's feline friends is named after @entity125 on @entity127 ' " @entity126			2
" many celebrities claim to be fans of their famous peers work , but @entity1 appears to be just as obsessed with your favorite tv shows as you are , almost as if she forgot that she , too , is on the a-list			2
she 's bffs with everyone , including her fans it 's not hard to rattle off @entity1 's famous friends , because she has a growing collection that includes everyone from @entity142 and @entity143 to actresses @entity145 and @entity146			1
but what makes @entity1 win over in the skeptics is her connection with her fans			2
she knows at least one of her supporters so well that she could make a surprise appearance at the fan 's bachelorette party with complete ease , posing for pictures and handing over a gift that she knew her fan would like			0
we 'll say that again : she knows her fans well enough that she can buy them personalized presents			0
who does that ? 5			0
her parties are as dorky as yours while some stars are always sharing photos of their exclusive vacations in exotic faraway locales , @entity1 's get - togethers look like they could 've been photographed in your neighbor 's backyard			1
@entity175 ? she 's baking a holiday - themed cake and hitting the @entity177			0
christmas season ? she 's constructing homemade holiday cards with actress @entity179			0
and of course , as endlessly chronicled on @entity181 , you know @entity1 will always dance like no one 's watching			1
