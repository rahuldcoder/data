-- she 's mentioned by name only once in 85 pages , but former secretary of state @entity4 was back under a @entity6 microscope after a @entity8 report on the killings of four @entity10 in @entity11			1
" sounds like the 2016 presidential race has now started , " sen. @entity12 , @entity13 , told @entity0			1
@entity16 leads early polls of potential @entity19 presidential contenders			1
@entity6 leaders quickly focused their fire on her after the @entity23 concluded that the 2012 assault on the @entity10 diplomatic outpost in @entity26 was " likely preventable " based on known security shortfalls and prior warnings			1
@entity10 ambassador @entity29 , @entity31 computer specialist @entity30 and security contractors @entity33 and @entity34 were killed in that attack			2
the @entity8 report spread the blame between the @entity31 and the intelligence community			1
@entity31 officials should have beefed up security in @entity11 's second - largest city because of general warnings that @entity10 personnel were at risk			0
the intelligence community could have flagged potential threats on " extremist - affiliated social media , " the report says			2
in addition , the report says intelligence officials inaccurately reported that a protest might have led to the attack , and took too long to correct the erroneous reports -- " which caused confusion and influenced the public statements of policymakers			1
" it follows a 2013 report by the @entity31 's @entity59 , which resulted in the reassignment of four @entity31 officials			2
but questions around security and intelligence as well as the changing explanation in the days that followed the attack -- which occurred in the heat of the 2012 presidential race -- led to allegations of a cover - up and repeated @entity6 calls for more explanation from the @entity73 administration			1
wednesday 's report did little to quiet them			2
" it raises questions that i think need to be answered before we can put this to rest , " said @entity12 , one of five @entity6 who blasted @entity16 in a statement of " additional views " tacked onto the end of the report -- the only part of the document that identifies her directly			1
they argued that as secretary of state , @entity16 bore " ultimate accountability " for security at the @entity26 mission , " and we believe there should be a full examination of her role in these events , including on the night of the attacks			1
" " in this case , there are a lot of finger pointing elsewhere as to failures of the process and failures of the agency , et cetera , " @entity12 said			0
" but no one really has stood up and said , ' i take responsibility for this			0
the @entity10 people want justice done here and closure to this issue			0
" @entity16 , who left office in february 2013 , has said she accepts responsibility for the @entity26 deaths			1
speaking on condition of anonymity , a @entity16 adviser told @entity0 , " four @entity10 lost their lives			1
we have never and will never approach this tragedy through the prism of politics			2
if others continue to do so for their own gain , they 're going to have to do it without us			0
" but sen. @entity133 , @entity135 - @entity134 , told @entity0 that @entity16 " has to clear the air on @entity26 " if she wants to be president			1
" she has a lot of accomplishments			0
she 's a very accomplished woman			0
but , under her leadership , the consulate became a death trap , " said @entity140 , who does n't sit on the @entity23			0
and sen. @entity144 , @entity145 , said , " the @entity10 people hold all of us accountable who are in responsibility			0
she should be held accountable			0
" but comments like that drew a sharp response from the committee 's chairwoman , @entity155 democrat @entity153 , on thursday			2
in a statement issued by her office , @entity153 said claims that the report blames @entity16 for the @entity26 deaths are " patently false , " and that the @entity6 addendum " unfairly criticizes secretary @entity16			1
" wednesday , @entity153 told @entity0 's @entity162 that " it 's interesting that the first thing out of the box is something that 's political			0
" and at the @entity168 , spokesman @entity167 criticized what he called " a very politicized effort on this that has seen a lot of conspiracy theories floated , reported on as fact , and then debunked			0
" " our interest is in getting those who are responsible , bringing them to justice , and taking the steps necessary to ensure that this kind of thing ca n't happen again or is far less likely to happen again , " @entity167 said thursday			0
but efforts to bring the perpetrators -- identified as members of a variety of @entity189 militant groups , some affiliated with @entity191 -- to justice have been frustrated by the lack of " political incentive or will " by @entity11 authorities to prosecute those believed responsible , the @entity8 report states			1
in addition , it noted , up to 15 people who had assisted the probe have been killed since september 2012 , though it was n't clear if the deaths were related to the probe			0
@entity0 's @entity204 and @entity205 contributed to this report .			2
