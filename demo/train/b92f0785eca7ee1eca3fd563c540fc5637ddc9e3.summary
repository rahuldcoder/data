@entity0 -- on the streets of @entity0 , something strange is afoot			1
gone are the blank stares , business suits and gray skies -- in their place : warm smiles , bright outfits and even the odd glimpse of sunshine			1
@entity13 fever has transformed the city			1
nowhere is this feeling more pronounced than at the @entity16 , scene of some of home side @entity20 's biggest triumphs and source of the nation 's new - look cheery mood			1
a few short years ago , this corner of east @entity0 was a post-industrial wasteland , blighted by pollution and contaminated ground and scarred by decades of neglect			1
now it 's a park , packed with wildflowers , public art and world - class sports facilities			2
walking to the site , thousands of face - painted , flag - waving , colorfully - dressed sports fans are met by an army of purple and red - clad volunteers dancing , joking and welcoming them			0
inside , riverside walkways teeming with flowers , all the colors of the rainbow , lead visitors to the venues : the spiky @entity48 , the sweeping @entity49 and the wave - like form of the @entity52			0
gritty @entity53 is @entity0 's gold standard along the way , officially - sanctioned buskers and street entertainers are on hand to amuse the crowds , and music pumps from speakers -- though it ca n't drown out the cheers of fans inside the arenas			2
" it 's just great -- what they 've done is fantastic : the venues are stunning and the landscaping looks great , " said @entity13 visitor @entity66			2
@entity72 said she had been lucky enough to see the park during its construction phase : " the transformation from all the mud and machinery back then is amazing , " she told @entity1			0
" the atmosphere is lovely , really friendly and positive , and it feels so well run , everything is so convenient and easy , right down to the fact there were n't even any queues for the toilets			0
" it 's all a far cry from the gloomy pre-games predictions : transport chaos , ticketing debacles , security shambles -- and fears of impending sporting disaster			1
@entity92 hopeful @entity91 earned the ire of @entity95 prime minister @entity94 and @entity0 's mayor @entity96 when just days before the torch was lit , he sounded a note of caution , claiming problems in the run - up to the event had been " disconcerting			2
" lesson from history for @entity13 missile row ? but former @entity107 director @entity106 said such pre-olympic jitters were only to be expected , and were common in host countries prior to the opening ceremony			1
" in many nations , in the two weeks before the @entity113 , there 's a sense of paranoia , that it 's not going to work , we 're going to embarrass ourselves on the world stage , it 'll be a disaster , " he said			0
it 's a view echoed by @entity66 : " i had so many problems getting tickets -- it was farcical -- so i was a bit down on the whole thing beforehand , but once i was there , i absolutely loved it			0
" @entity106 said such concerns were quickly forgotten once the @entity113 began : " it 's all paid off , and frankly has gone a lot smoother than they even dared hope			0
" one @entity131 visitor to @entity0 said the @entity13 were a welcome distraction from less positive national and international news			1
" there 's a lot of negativity going on just now in the @entity95 and worldwide , with the recession , but this has been phenomenal -- it 's brought everybody together , " he said			0
and while brits are always happy to cheer on the plucky underdogs -- wherever they are from -- it is clear that @entity20 has benefited from a huge home advantage			1
@entity143 : @entity16 's red ' roller coaster ' @entity147 - winning rower @entity145 credited the support of the positive crowds with helping him and his fellow competitors make it to the podium in larger than expected numbers			0
" winning in @entity0 , doing it in front of a home crowd , was extraordinary , " he told @entity1			1
" i always thought it could be big , but i did n't imagine it would be this big -- we were lifted right up from the beginning			0
" @entity20 's medal gold rush has certainly helped the host nation 's mood , but so has the sense that the games have done @entity95 proud			1
for a few short weeks , the eyes of the world were on @entity0 and -- to everyone 's surprise -- it went well			2
the hard graft paid off , and the country can , albeit temporarily , cast off its carapace of cynicism , sit back and simply enjoy the moment			0
so , will this unexpected good mood last once the torch has been extinguished and the last @entity176 has packed their bags and moved out of the village ? will a renewed optimism be one of the legacies of @entity183 , alongside the green spaces , the arenas and the thirst for sporting success ? @entity66 is among those who hope the @entity113 will have a lasting impact on the city and its people			1
" the levels of happiness and optimism around at the moment may not last , " she admits			2
" but i hope it will neutralize some of the cynicism around , and help people see what is possible when everyone pulls together			0

@entity13 fever has transformed @entity0 into a *sea* of cheery smiles and bright outfits
security shambles and pre-games predictions of transport chaos left @entity210 worried
*performance* of home side @entity20 has done host nation proud
hopes renewed optimism will be among the lasting legacies of @entity183
