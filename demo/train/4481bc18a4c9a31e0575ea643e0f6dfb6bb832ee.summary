@entity0 wore body armor and a gas mask			1
he brandished an assault rifle , an assortment of grenades , " all kinds of ammunition " and even used his silver @entity8 as a weapon of sorts , according to authorities			1
the 48 - year - old man toted his own water supply and flexible handcuffs , presumably to corral hostages once he got inside the north @entity17 courthouse			1
as @entity20 sheriff @entity19 said , " he came prepared to do this			0
" but @entity0 never even made it inside			1
a nearly three - minute long gunfight friday ended with @entity0 dead , after being confronted by a swarm of law enforcement officers			1
they seemingly came from everywhere -- from the jail across the street , as part of a swat team that happened to be nearby and even inside the courthouse where they busted out windows in order to get more angles to target the attacked			0
@entity36 singled out one officer in particular -- a veteran sheriff 's deputy who first confronted @entity0 , who then tried to run the deputy over -- for his vital part in deterring the attacker			1
shot twice in the leg , the deputy was the only person wounded despite what the sheriff called " a full frontal assault			1
" " it was very close to being a major catastrophe , " @entity36 said			1
" the deputy that was shot ... averted what , i think , would have been a lot more deaths			1
" @entity53 , significant response to attack @entity0 was supposed to be at the @entity56 in @entity57			1
court documents show he faced 11 felony charges -- 10 of them related to the manufacture , possession and sale of illicit drugs , including marijuana , plus one count of having a firearm while in the commission of a felony -- dating back to august 2011			0
according to the sheriff 's office , he was expected to enter a plea friday before chief superior court judge @entity71			0
needless to say , he never made it			0
instead , around 10 a.m. friday , @entity0 drove up to the courthouse , threw out " homemade spike strips " to delay any police response , and tried to run over the deputy , @entity36 said			1
the deputy -- a 30 - year veteran whose duties include canvassing the scene outside the courthouse -- opened fire , and @entity0 returned fire through his windshield			1
he did n't stop with bullets			0
according to the sheriff , @entity0 tossed tear gas grenades , smoke grenades and pepper spray grenades -- something he could do more easily with his gas mask strapped on			1
despite this barrage of weapons , the sheriff 's deputy was able to distract @entity0 , to slow him			1
even a little delay made a big difference , as officers armed with assault rifles came over from the jail across the street			2
a swat team pulled up about 30 seconds into the firefight and engaged the attacker , according to @entity36			0
the sheriff initially estimated the whole thing took 90 seconds but , after watching more video , he doubled that time			0
however long it lasted , it ended with @entity0 dead of multiple gunshot wounds			2
with eight officers opening fire at one point , authorities do n't yet know which one of them fired the fatal shot			0
' he was there to occupy the courthouse ' afterward , the wounded deputy -- identified by local media as @entity120 -- was transported to a local hospital			2
there , the officer had surgery for fractures to his fibula and tibia in the lower right leg , injuries @entity36 said were n't life - threatening			2
but his colleagues still had to work to do			0
they went to @entity0 's home in @entity57 , a small city about 35 northeast of downtown @entity133 , with every expectation that it was booby trapped			2
as @entity36 said : " last time we were at the home , we were suspicious because it had been booby trapped before			0
" once they finally made their way in and cleared the house , they found homemade explosives , according to a law enforcement source			0
it was n't clear whether those were attempted booby traps			0
a preliminary investigation found that @entity0 had n't been in his @entity57 home for about 10 days			2
besides that , little is known about him beyond that he began working at the @entity151 in october 2002 , according to a @entity153 official , and left either the next year or in 2004			0
the sheriff said friday that he and others were n't ready yet to discuss @entity0 's motive or his thinking			1
that said , @entity36 said it was evident that @entity0 " came prepared to stay a while			2
" " we do n't know who he was coming to the courthouse for , but with the flex ties and the restraining devices he had with him , " said the sheriff			2
" we have to assume that he was there to occupy the courthouse			0
" who is the student who pounded on the @entity170 gunman ? @entity172 shooting : suspect yelled ' i 'm done ' at time of arrest @entity176 seals off @entity178 military hospital in hunt for stabbing suspect			0
