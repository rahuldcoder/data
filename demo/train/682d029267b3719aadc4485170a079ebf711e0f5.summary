-- the changes to @entity3 's singing competition shows have only just begun			1
after weeks of dramatic headlines about " @entity11 's " slipping ratings and " @entity10 's " talent departures , @entity3 's president of alternative entertainment @entity8 spoke to @entity0 about the challenges faced by " @entity11 " and " @entity10 " -- and his strategy for remaining on top			1
given their large number of hours and consistent ability to win time periods , one could argue that " idol " and " factor " are the no. 1 network 's most important shows			1
so what does it mean when the bulk of the " factor " cast abruptly gets pink - slipped and " @entity11 " has @entity31 ' " @entity30 " nipping at its heels on thursday nights ? with " factor " , the sudden exodus of host @entity33 , judge @entity35 â € @entity34 € ¬ and executive producer @entity37 's longtime tv - spouse @entity36 may have stunned observers ( @entity39 will return )			1
yet the move was somewhat less surprising to followers of the @entity43 version , which sheds judges every few seasons			0
in a genre where tough - love auditions are the heart of the format , @entity8 described being a star on " @entity10 's " debut as not entirely dissimilar to being a contestant			1
" season one was basically an audition act , " said @entity8 late last week			0
" @entity37 got one big new star out of it -- @entity39 , and that was great casting			0
there 's going to be a natural reassessment			2
" viewers largely accepted the departure of @entity33 and â € @entity63 , yet the loss of @entity65 raised concern			0
she may not have been the strongest contributor to the show , the reasoning went , but she did n't seem to be an overt problem either			2
" @entity36 was an interesting call , " @entity8 said			0
" she and @entity37 are great friends , so it was just a dynamic conversation about what 's the nature of the group going to be			2
and i think we decided to pull the band - aid off as quickly as possible			0
" @entity3 hopes to fill the spots over the next several months			1
it 's reasonable to expect the network will pursue big music stars , with the caveat that prospective judges also should also have workable chemistry with @entity37			1
the bottom line is that @entity3 wants to take a show that was already typically winning its night and find every way possible to improve it -- including brainstorming creative changes apart from the on - air talent			1
" there definitely will be lots of different changes in the show , " @entity8 said			1
that said , @entity8 dismissed one tv critic complaint that the show seemed " inauthentic			2
" " that 's the kind of stuff that pundits talk about that does n't mean anything to the audience , " he said			2
" it was a very consistent audience for that show			2
the audience that stuck with the show loved it			2
" over on " idol , " @entity8 faces the trickier challenge of keeping an 11 - year - old hit feeling fresh and compelling without altering its popular fundamentals			0
asked why " @entity11 's " ratings have softened , @entity8 agreed with tv analysts who point to the flood of singing competition shows			1
@entity11 used to be an annual event			1
now there 's wide - eyed young singers , brutal judges and suspenseful eliminations on tv all year around			2
the other programs include @entity3 's own " factor , " of course ( when @entity37 decided to launch a @entity131 version of his @entity43 hit , @entity3 had little choice but to get on board , lest risk losing him to a rival network )			1
" there 's no question there 's a glut of [ singing competition shows that are ] affecting the numbers for @entity11 , " @entity8 said			1
" it 's the granddaddy , it 's run is unprecedented			2
i think that considering all the other shows and its age , it 's doing quite well			1
having both shows on our air has put us in an incredibly strong position as a network			1
" " idol " is still a no. 1 for the season and averages about 20 million viewers a week			1
while " @entity30 " and @entity160 's " @entity159 " are closing the gap , " idol " generates more than 50 hours per season compared to roughly 11 for half - hour comedies ( no drama series come close to @entity11 's numbers )			1
like with the recent " factor " headlines , @entity3 has weathered plenty of second - guessing media coverage over the past several years of " idol " panel changes			1
some pundits predicted @entity37 exiting the show two years ago would be a fatal blow , especially since the ratings were already declining			2
yet when looking at the ratings , " idol " changes over the years seemed to help offset audience erosion			0
" idol " typically only dropped about 10 - 12 percent each season despite its age , often returned better than most industry observers expected			0
after last year 's well - received addition of judges @entity185 and @entity186 , making further alterations would have appeared foolish -- why fix a show that was n't broken ? but with the new season 's ratings down more than 20 percent , it raises the question : is " idol " at a point where it now requires major changes each season to keep fans ' interest ? though making a judgement on next year 's " idol " panel is months away , @entity8 noted viewers can expect to see some twists this season			1
" there 's always freshening up , " he said			2
" we 've done rule changes , we 've eliminated the middle rounds , we put in the judges ' ' save			0
' and there will be some changes coming to the show this year that no one knows about yet , [ though ] they 're more modest than last year			0
what you try to do generally is if you have a year of big changes , you try to let those settle for at least another year			0
@entity219 can help , or it can kill you if it 's the wrong change			1
you never want to change the core of the show , no matter what the competition is doing , because that 's what people come back for			1
" one frequent point of viewer debate is the number of good auditions vs. humorously bad auditions			0
as with every aspect of his shows , @entity8 has given the matter plenty of thought and experimented with different possibilities			0
" we used to have more bad than good , " he said			0
" over the last three years we 've gone the opposite direction			0
i think it 's a balancing act			0
one of the things that separate ' idol ' from the other shows is that we have the fun and funny auditions , that 's why those [ opening weeks ] numbers are usually big			1
if you go too far in one direction or the other , that 's a mistake			0
and you have to be careful about which bad auditions are shown			0
the @entity252 of the world work , but people dressed as bananas do n't			0
they have to be sincere auditions			0
" and if the unthinkable happens			0
if " idol , " after eight seasons as tv 's top - rated entertainment program , should slip ... @entity8 predicted the network -- and the show -- will survive just fine			1
" it would be nice to reign forever as no. 1 , " @entity8 said			1
" but if ' idol ' ever becomes a second - or third - place show , it still has a much bigger impact and value than most other shows because it accounts for so many more hours			2
obviously all shows come down , but to still be at this level is amazing , and we 're really grateful for that			0
