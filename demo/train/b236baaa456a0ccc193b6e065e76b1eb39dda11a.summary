-- president @entity1 announced that 300 companies -- including @entity3 , @entity4 and others -- have signed a pledge to help the long - term unemployed by making sure they do n't have barriers in their hiring practices			1
this is good news , but it wo n't solve the problem			0
the best we can hope for is that the companies now will make special efforts to seek out and employ those who have suffered long - term joblessness			1
that 's a nice start , but feel - good gestures wo n't cut it when there are almost 4 million @entity21 who have been out of work for more than six months			1
that 's a big number			0
what 's disconcerting is that the current long - term unemployment is more serious than in previous economic downturns			1
data from previous business cycles show people suffering from long - run joblessness at worst accounted for about 20 % to 25 % of the unemployed			1
in recent months , that percentage has jumped to nearly 40 % -- an all - time record ! indeed , @entity21 is beginning to look like @entity33			2
it used to be that long - term unemployment in the @entity21 was only a fraction of @entity33 's , but the latest data from the @entity39 show that the @entity21 has caught up to many of @entity33 's welfare states			1
that 's not a race we want to be part of , much less win			0
so what 's the solution ? there 's no silver bullet , but economic growth is the single most important key			2
all forms of unemployment get worse when the economy is weak			0
but when the economy is booming , the job market gets better for everybody -- including those who have been unemployed for long periods			2
unfortunately , economic growth has n't proven easy			2
the recession may have ended officially in the summer of 2009 , but we 're still suffering through a sluggish economic cycle			0
recent improvements in the overall employment rate are in large part the result of people dropping out of the labor force , and the problem of long - run unemployment has barely budged			2
to boost employment , we need the kind of strong growth @entity21 enjoyed during the @entity76 and @entity77 years , when millions of new jobs were created and the unemployment rate fell dramatically			2
to get there , we need a return to the types of free - market policies we got under @entity76 and @entity77 : a lower burden of government spending and less intervention from @entity87			1
unfortunately , we 've been moving in the exact opposite direction			0
under both presidents @entity92 and @entity1 , the size and scope of government has expanded , and the @entity21 -- which had the world 's third-most free - market economy when @entity77 left office -- has now dropped to 17th in the @entity97 rankings			1
we also need to make sure the unemployed do n't get lured into long - term dependency			1
one glaring example of misguided big - government policy is the argument to endlessly extend unemployment benefits			0
that sounds compassionate , but according to economists such policies discourage the unemployed from aggressively seeking new jobs			2
there is also persuasive evidence that employers are reluctant to hire people ( regardless of any " pledges " they may sign ) who have been out of work for lengthy periods , which makes the president 's preferred approach of more unemployment benefits akin to an overprotective parent who hinders a child 's development			0
moreover , @entity1 's proposed hike in the minimum wage would actually counteract any good his pledge would do			0
why ? increasing the minimum wage is the equivalent of sawing off the bottom rungs on the economic ladder			0
simply stated , businesses create jobs when they think a new employee will help the bottom line			0
artificially raising the cost of workers -- particularly those with marginal skills -- is a recipe for creating more unemployment			0
the president 's effort to get companies on board with hiring the long - term unemployed should be applauded , but he should n't for one second think that it will solve the problem			1
in fact , too many of his other proposals would serve only to exacerbate the problem the long - term unemployed are facing			1
instead , @entity1 should take a page out of the @entity76 and @entity77 presidencies and take action to get to the root of unemployment : economic growth			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity154 .			0

300 companies pledged to aid @entity1 initiative to help the long - term unemployed
@entity154 : this is a nice gesture , but nearly 4 million @entity21 need jobs
he says economic growth is key and free - market polices are what we need
@entity154 : the unemployed should not get lured into long - term dependency
