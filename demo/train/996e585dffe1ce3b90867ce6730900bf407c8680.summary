@entity0 -- concerns about the effects of toxins emitted from burning trash at military installations in @entity9 and @entity10 have members of @entity3 demanding more tests and research			1
the @entity14 military burns waste -- including medical waste -- in pits near an air force base in @entity9			1
the members of @entity3 want information from the military to see if there is statistical validity to complaints about illness and disease suffered by troops who served in those countries			1
the emissions , from what are known as " burn pits , " have been a concern for troops , especially those who served at @entity32 in @entity9			1
many of the soldiers who went through @entity32 since the beginning of the war became used to " @entity9 crud , " as they dubbed the symptom of excessive coughing and black phlegm			1
soldiers complained of respiratory problems and skin infections , and in some cases believe they developed leukemia and tumors from the exposure			0
the pits at @entity32 were at one point open and burning everything from plastics and food to medical waste			2
in later years , incinerators were installed at @entity32 , but many other bases in @entity9 and @entity10 still use the pits without incinerators to burn garbage			1
various tests by the military concluded that emissions are not harmful			2
the military said smoke from the pit exposed troops to toxic emissions , including low levels of cancer - causing dioxins			2
but its tests indicate there is no long - term danger , officials said			0
" the data indicate that there are no substances above a health threshold that should generate any long - term health risks , including cancer , " @entity75 of the force readiness and health assurance office at the @entity78 said			0
at the @entity78 's @entity86 , officials analyzed more than 160 air samples and concluded , in a soon to be released report , that the only risk is of temporary respiratory distress , nothing that poses a long - term threat			0
but many -- including some members of @entity3 -- remain unconvinced			2
" after years of helping veterans of the @entity100 and @entity101 wars cope with the health effects of toxic battlefields , we have learned that we must take exposures to toxins seriously to ensure that this generation of service members does not face the same difficulties , " the congressmen say in the letter to be sent monday to the @entity97			0
the letter , signed by six representatives including rep. @entity111 , @entity113 - @entity112 , asks for data from the military about tumor rates to see if a pattern of problems can be ascertained			0
@entity1 was given a copy of the letter in advance			0
" we are collecting this data in order to help better understand what is happening to our troops in @entity9 and @entity10 , " the letter explains			1
" this would help to ensure specific benefits for service members who have been discharged from service if they become disabled because of certain diseases			0
