-- several potential @entity2 presidential contenders are heading to @entity3 this week , hoping to hit the jackpot			1
and that 's before they hit the casinos			2
they hope the political payoff will come in appearances before some of the party 's most influential donors attending the @entity14 annual spring meeting			1
former @entity16 gov. @entity15 and current @entity17			1
@entity18 of @entity19 , @entity20 of @entity21 and @entity22 of @entity23 will speak before the group , which seeks to promote @entity26 causes among @entity2			1
many of the nation 's leading @entity2 fundraisers and donors are part of the organization			1
some donors estimate about a third of the party 's most important fundraisers are active in the coalition , so it 's a major audience for the possible presidential candidates attending			1
@entity15 is getting a lot of attention because he has been tapped to speak at a private , vip dinner with major financiers on thursday night -- giving him top billing for the event and a major platform as he considers whether to seek the party 's nomination			1
while he has said he wo n't make a decision until the end of this year and wo n't engage in further talk about the subject , @entity15 has recently picked up the pace with his political schedule , appearing in the past two weeks at fundraisers for sen. @entity56 , @entity57 , and @entity17			1
@entity59 , @entity60 , and @entity61 , @entity62 , both running for re-election , as well as at an event for @entity65 helping him build a network of supporters if he needs one			0
" @entity15 has something to prove at this meeting , " one influential @entity2 donor who will be attending told @entity0			1
" it is pretty significant " for him to come to the event because he has refused to tip his hand any more about his intentions , the donor said			0
" @entity15 has to do a good job of handling that issue			1
" another party money man said the event is a " great opportunity for him " with decision - makers			0
" showing up and speaking is showing ' i am taking this seriously , ' " is how he put it to @entity0			0
@entity15 , who served as @entity16 's governor from 1999 to 2007 , is liked by many in this key group			1
during his tenure , and his father 's and brother 's time in the @entity90 , they built good relations with the @entity93			0
@entity15 , @entity94 together again to talk education many eyes on @entity18 as well @entity18 , who speaks on saturday , is also known to many in this group			1
" most of the people will be making a judgment on @entity18 " during his appearance , one of the donors told @entity0			0
" we are not absent ' @entity105 , ' " referring to the scandal over the closing of access lanes to the @entity109 last year in an apparent act of political retaliation by some of his aides			0
@entity18 has said he was not aware of the closings until they happened			0
" people are going to want to have the hallway conversations ... private meetings " to discuss where the controversy stands , the donor said			1
a different major party fundraiser said that @entity18 so far has emerged fine among many of the donors , who like his political accomplishments and policies			0
" i do n't think in the long term this will harm him , " the fundraiser said			0
as @entity18 travels around the country raising millions as head of the @entity136 , he is building up support among the donor class			2
besides their public appearances at the meeting , @entity18 , @entity22 and @entity20 all can be expected to have smaller individual sessions with some influential attendees			0
@entity18 : bridge scandal does n't change anything about 2016 will @entity146 tip his hand ? the host for the weekend activities is @entity2 mega-donor @entity146 , owner of the @entity150 where the meeting is taking place , and active in the @entity14			1
@entity146 and his wife gave $ 93 million to various groups and candidates in the 2012 election cycle , according to the @entity157 , making them the biggest individuals financiers of outside groups			2
the thursday dinner will be at the airport hangar @entity146 uses			0
while candidates and groups would love to have his support , several @entity2 donors said they doubt @entity146 will tip his hand any time soon			1
one said he is " very hard to uncover ... he likes to support existing groups with real structure			0
" @entity146 did support the super pac winning our future that backed former house speaker @entity174 in 2012 because of his pro-israel stance , a majority priority for @entity146			0
besides @entity146 , some of the more influential @entity2 fundraisers include businessman @entity179 , former ambassador @entity180 , former @entity182 chairman @entity181 , and former ambassador @entity183			2
@entity184 ' very open ' to another presidential run all over the place unlike four years ago where most of these donors ended up supporting @entity189 , this go - around is expected to be much different			2
" you still have the donor groups all over the place , " said one of the fundraisers while also emphasizing just how early in this process things stand			0
the amount of activity by the field of possible 2016 contenders reaching out to prospective financial backers is at about the same pace it was four years ago , several of those interviewed said			2
what is different , they said , is that the field at this stage appears to be shaping up to be much stronger than last time around -- meaning the battle for support among these key supporters will likely be intense			2
" i think the difference is in the quality of the candidates , " the fundraiser said			0
@entity0 has learned @entity219 gov. @entity218 and @entity221 gov. @entity220 , who have been traveling the country as part of their official duties , met recently with some prominent @entity2 donors , but did not indicate their future plans			1
one of the most active republicans considering a @entity90 bid has been sen. @entity230 of @entity231 , who has met with donors and who has been working to broaden his appeal beyond his father 's libertarian base			2
desire to break glass ceiling big part of aura around @entity240			0
