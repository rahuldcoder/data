-- sticks are the new boxes , at least when it comes to getting the internet on your television			0
on tuesday , @entity7 released its latest tool for streaming 1080p content directly to a tv			1
like the $ 100 @entity13 set - top box , the new $ 50 @entity11 has a large selection of apps for streaming content , including all the major online services such as @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			1
the new @entity13 stick is about the size of a pack of gum and will be available in april			1
as game consoles , cable boxes and other bulky accessories pile up in living rooms , the smaller , more discreet stick approach is becoming an appealing choice for consumers who want to watch @entity4 content on their tv screens without adding to the clutter			1
this is not @entity13 's first foray into the stick form factor			1
but unlike its 2 - year - old $ 90 version , the @entity11 will pop into any @entity40 port , making it compatible with many more televisions			1
the @entity43 will compete directly against @entity45 's well - received @entity44 , released last year			1
the @entity45 dongle costs only $ 35 and also plugs into any tv hdmi port			1
to watch @entity4 content on the @entity44 , you hit a button on compatible apps from an @entity53 or @entity54 smartphone or tablet			2
both sticks require a separate power source , either through a usb port on the back of the tv or by plugging into a wall			0
the @entity43 will cost a few bucks more than the @entity44 but includes a dedicated remote control , like other @entity13 products			2
for people who prefer navigating with soft buttons to swiping a smartphone screen , this can be a big plus			0
@entity13 's biggest advantage is content			0
because the service has been around for a while , it has many more streaming options than the @entity44			2
there are currently about 1,200 available apps for @entity13			0
@entity45 recently opened up its @entity44 device to outside developers , so it 's possible a wave of new content is on its way			1
for now , its big names are @entity18 , @entity82 , @entity19 , @entity83 and @entity84 , plus a handful of smaller apps			0
a third major competitor in the streaming - to - tv space is @entity89			2
@entity91 's offering is still an old - fashioned box , but it could just be a matter of time before the company jumps on the stick - shaped bandwagon			2
it has more content options than a @entity44 but still lags behind the @entity13			0
of course , an @entity91 device would appeal to people already deep into the @entity91 ecosystem			0
cable companies have been slow to update their set - top boxes , and smart tvs have n't caught on in the same way that easy - to - use @entity89 , @entity44 and @entity13 have			0
@entity7 is also working directly with television manufacturers to integrate its technology into their tvs .			0

@entity7 's new @entity11 is a small device that plugs into a tv
the $ 50 device is a direct competitor to @entity45 's $ 35 @entity44 stick
the device can be ordered now and will ship in april
