the @entity6 @entity5 announced via @entity7 that he is formally seeking the 2012 @entity5 presidential nomination			1
@entity9 is widely viewed as the most serious official @entity5 candidate so far			1
" i 'm announcing my candidacy for president of the @entity15 because i believe we can return @entity15 to hope and opportunity , " the former speaker said in a campaign video posted online			1
" we @entity15 are going to have to talk together , to work together , find solutions together , and insist on imposing those solutions on those forces that do n't want to change			2
" the candidate called for more jobs , a balanced budget and decentralized government			2
" there are some people who do n't mind if @entity15 becomes a wreck so long as they dominate the wreckage , " @entity9 said			2
" but you and i know better			2
" " let 's get together , look reality in the face , tell the truth , make the tough choices and get the job done , " he declared			2
" there 's a much better @entity15 future ahead			2
" @entity41 majority leader @entity40 , @entity42 , said earlier wednesday that " the discussion around the presidential race will obviously increase " when @entity9 entered the race for the @entity5 nomination			2
" i think @entity9 has always been an ideas man , and i 'm sure that will provide a lot of positive input to the debate , " @entity40 said			2
@entity9 's online announcement followed a recent trend by national politicians to make major announcements through the @entity56			2
@entity57 first announced his selection of @entity59 as his running mate in 2008 on his campaign website and in a text message to supporters			1
then - sen. @entity64 announced her presidential candidacy in 2007 with the release of a statement and video on her campaign website			1
asked about his embracing of technology to make his announcement , @entity9 told @entity75 ' @entity74 on wednesday night that " there are a lot of principles that have n't changed			1
" he came out swinging against @entity57 , the " elite " media and @entity80			1
@entity57 should be ashamed of himself for " dishonest scare tactics " in comments about @entity5 approaches to the budget and immigration , @entity9 said , adding he wanted to " clear away the liberal policies			1
" the candidate has traveled to key early voting states trying to build a network of support and has met with fundraisers			2
he has assembled a campaign team and told supporters he aims to raise $ 100 million			1
during his appearances , the former speaker has pushed a wide array of policy proposals in his bid to lay the foundation of a campaign and prove he is a serious candidate , not just a symbol of the past			1
" i expect the @entity15 people in the end will be remarkably fair			2
they 'll render judgment , and they 'll decide whether or not @entity2 is somebody that they think can solve the country 's problems and be the kind of leader they want for this country , " @entity9 told @entity75 in march			1
he has given his audiences a lot of political red meat and has not shied away from controversy			2
speaking at the @entity120 event in march , he said there is a difference between a majority of @entity15 and " the secular socialist people around ( president @entity57 ) @entity57 and the degree to which they do not understand @entity15 , can not possibly represent @entity15 and can not lead us to success			1
" @entity9 has an agenda the includes overturning the health care reform bill , eliminating the @entity131 , pushing more development of energy sources and advocating tax cuts			1
" he is a polarizing figure ( who ) comes with a fair degree of baggage , " @entity135 , who worked on the 2008 @entity136 , told @entity1			1
he said @entity9 has to make himself relevant to the current political climate			2
" he does represent the past but has to show why he represents the future , " @entity135 said , adding that he thinks right now @entity9 is having difficulty doing that			0
" if he can demonstrate why he is relevant to the future in the current political climate , " @entity135 said , " the baggage will dissipate			0
" some @entity5 activists not affiliated with a campaign have said @entity9 might not be disciplined enough to focus his ideas to run a successful campaign			1
pollster @entity152 , who worked with @entity9 during his years in the @entity41 , said he can			0
" there is n't any question @entity2 is a person with lots of ideas , " @entity152 told @entity1			1
" the step for @entity2 here is to not just merely focus on the future ... ( but to ) focus on the problems the country is most worried about			1
" @entity9 told @entity74 he is better equipped to be president than when he left office 12 years ago			1
" it 's fair to say i am more mature , " he said			0
" i have had time to reflect on what worked and what did n't work			0
" he declined to list who his strongest @entity5 foe might be , instead saying the focus is on the president			1
the former @entity41 speaker , who converted to @entity173 , the religion of his current wife , has especially reached out to the social conservative wing of the party , a segment critical to success in the key states of @entity181 and @entity182			0
many of those activists are skeptical of @entity9 because of his two divorces			0
" there 's no question at times of my life , partially driven by how passionately i felt about this country , that i worked far too hard and things happened in my life that were not appropriate , " @entity9 explained to the @entity187 's @entity186			0
after the @entity6 @entity5 lost two runs for @entity196 in the 1970s , his third attempt in 1978 was successful			0
he was aggressive and rose to the second spot in the @entity41 @entity5 leadership			0
he was instrumental in helping to craft the @entity199 , a blueprint that helped the @entity5 take control of the @entity41			0
he was elected speaker but , after a disappointing @entity5 showing in the @entity41 elections in 1998 , he decided to retire in 1999			0
he then went about rehabilitating his political career , forming a conservative policy think tank called @entity15 solutions , starting a string of successful businesses and becoming a political commentator			0
he has an impressive record of fundraising , he has developed a large network of supporters and he has authored almost two dozen books and produced movies on a wide range of topics			1
@entity9 still has some work to do on his reputation			0
forty - four percent of those surveyed in a recent @entity222 poll said they had an unfavorable opinion of him , while 30 % said they had a favorable one			0
that gives him one of the largest unfavorable rankings of the @entity5 presidential contenders , although it also shows he has high name recognition			0
when republicans are asked who they favor for the nomination , 10 % choose @entity9 , tying him with rep. @entity235 of @entity236 but behind @entity237 , @entity238 , @entity239 and @entity240			0
" he brings a lot to the debate			0
but there are a lot of candidates in the process of going through a presidential primary			0
we 'll sort out the good from the bad , and we 'll end up with a good candidate , " house speaker @entity248 , @entity249 , said on @entity251 's " today " show tuesday regarding a @entity9 candidacy			0
it has not been all smooth sailing as @entity9 tested the waters			0
he admitted his advisers flubbed the initial announcement in march that he was exploring a run and starting a website , when expectations were built up that they would announce a more formal step			0
" it led to unfortunate confusion , " he told the @entity265			1
" i wish we had been a little more structured ... but i do n't take it as a serious problem			0
" @entity9 also drew some criticism for not giving a coherent critique of the @entity57 administration 's policy on @entity274			1
he told @entity75 on march 7 , when asked what he would do , that he would " exercise a no - fly zone this evening			1
" but later , after a no - fly zone was put in place , he said on @entity251 's " @entity280 " that " i would not have intervened			0
i think there are a lot of other ways to affect ( @entity274 leader @entity285 ) @entity284			0
" for his part , @entity9 has denied he flip - flopped , saying he was just commenting on the circumstances as they changed			0
he posted on his @entity290 page : " president @entity57 said publicly that ' it 's time for @entity284 to go			1
' prior to this statement there were options to be indirect and subtle to achieve this result without @entity15 military forces			0
" " the president , however , took those options off the table with his public statement , " he continued			1
" that 's why during a march 7th @entity304 interview , i asserted that the president should establish a no - fly zone ' this evening			1
' " @entity1 's @entity307 and @entity308 contributed to this story .			0
