@entity0 has been known to go into the grocery store , buy fried chicken and eat four pieces of it in the parking lot			1
but that was the old her			2
now when she has that craving she buys a rotisserie chicken , takes the skin off and eats only one piece			1
she does n't actually know how much weight she 's lost over the last year - and - a - half because she previously was too embarrassed to get on a scale			1
she knows she once wore a size 20			1
now she 's a size 4			1
a former dance teacher , @entity0 never thought about what she was eating because she burned so many calories with aerobics , jazz , clogging , tap and ballet			1
then a broken foot landed her on the couch			0
she remembers sitting in her house for weeks , eating her sorrows away			0
" every time there was a crisis i turned to food for solace , " the @entity27 resident says			0
and once she started , she could n't stop			0
her weight went up and down as her foot healed and her husband recovered from two different life - threatening illnesses			1
@entity0 would lose 20 pounds then put it back on , then lose and gain again			1
two years ago , she was shopping for a dress to wear to her son 's wedding			1
everything she tried on she thought looked like a potato sack			0
when she finally found a dress , the saleswoman told her it would look better if she lost 5 pounds			1
@entity0 remembers thinking the woman really meant 35 pounds			1
with five months until the wedding , she went home and decided to try to lose five pounds by watching what she ate			0
those five pounds disappeared pretty quickly			0
she started questioning all her food choices			0
" is it worth it to eat this piece of cake ? " she would ask herself			0
the answer was usually " no. " she soon realized she did n't need what she calls the frills , such as croutons and mayonnaise - based dressing on salad			0
she became more and more careful about what she put in her mouth			0
she stopped sampling her recipes while cooking			0
people often say to her , " you ca n't lose weight that way , " she says , and she proudly tells them , " yes you can because i did			1
" soon that dress for her son 's wedding in june 2012 was too big			2
she needed a size 16 and was elated to fit into a " normal " size			2
" i did n't look like the fat lady anymore , but i did n't look like the skinny lady either , " she says			0
she kept at it by making simple changes -- a strategy she continues today			2
at breakfast , for example , she 'll go for low sugar instant oatmeal , which is 110 calories instead of 160 calories for the regular packet			0
all those extra calories add up over the course of a year , @entity0 says , and to save them you are n't really giving up anything			1
upwave : try it now ! cut back on added sugar portion control is also important , she says			0
instead of eating a sandwich or two for lunch , she has soup and tuna salad or cottage cheese			0
because she lacks discipline , she buys individual cups of cottage cheese instead of a big container to prevent herself from eating twice as much as she should			0
she wants people to know eating healthy does n't have to be horrible : " you just have to think about what you are doing			0
" these days she does n't even have the urge to eat anything fattening , although she did enjoy some chocolate cake with ice cream on her birthday			0
she shared it with her husband , @entity113 , who is also reaping the benefits of his wife 's change in lifestyle			2
@entity113 has lost 85 pounds			2
@entity0 lost 25 pounds before she even added exercise into the equation			1
now she takes a @entity121 class twice a week and walks several miles to and from her synagogue to attended religious services on saturday			1
she says that walk is much easier at her current size than it used to be			2
she 's tried other exercise routines such as walking on the treadmill , but says that bores her and she ends up going home and eating afterward			2
one year after trying to take off five pounds to fit into that size 20 dress , @entity0 was wearing a size 8			1
on a recent shopping trip , she came out of the fitting room in a dress and the saleswoman told her it was too big			0
@entity0 laughed and showed the woman a picture of the old her			1
then she bought a size 4			1
she says she was happy when she got down to a size 10 , but she 's happier at a size 4			1
" this is the first time in my life that i feel like i do n't need to lose weight , " she says			2
@entity0 , now 65 , worries about gaining the weight back but knows it 's different this time			1
she 's still getting used to her new body but says it 's definitely not temporary			2
" i did n't go on a diet , " she says			2
" i changed my lifestyle			0

@entity0 wore a size 20 ; now she 's a size 4

she takes a @entity121 class twice a week and walks to her synagogue on saturdays
