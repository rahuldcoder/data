-- one day after @entity5 last year , my mother , brother , cousin and i gathered in my 87 - year - old grandmother 's room at the nursing home			1
we knew it would be one of the last times we would see her alive			1
she knew it , too			2
" i do n't know when , i do n't know how , i do n't know why , " my grandmother @entity14 said that day			1
" but i know one thing			2
@entity16 is going to take me home			2
he 's going to take me home			2
" home is comfortable : warm like a hug and familiar like the smell of my grandmother 's seasoned greens			1
but so often the ease of intimacy slips into taking our loved ones for granted			1
it 's what crossed my mind as i listened to her that day			2
what did n't i know about her life ? what had i not said ? how much of this moment would i remember ? grandmother @entity14 had not been able to sit at the @entity5 table that year , confined to a bed as she recovered after a medical procedure			1
we visited her on @entity5 and afterward to bring home to her			1
two months later , she was dead			2
we knew that she knew how much we loved her			1
we made sure of it			0
but there is still the absence of an everyday presence that requires adjusting -- slippers found that bring back a story and smile , a song or smell that triggers a forgotten memory			0
for decades , our family had incorporated a friendly inquisition into our @entity5 gatherings , much to the amusement of guests			1
friends , neighbors and travelers joined us , an ever - changing mosaic of characters			0
but a few traditions stayed the same			0
there would be an element of service -- volunteering at a soup kitchen , preparing meals to share , hosting those without homes , a visit to the less fortunate			1
and of course , delectable , savory food : sweet potato pie , yummy stuffing paired with cranberry sauce , gooey macaroni and cheese , luscious candied yams , soupy greens and warm , buttered rolls			0
but my favorite part of the meal had less to do with what we put in our mouths and more with what came out of them			0
we are a communicative family , but @entity5 always provided a special time to vocalize for what , and for whom we were grateful , and why			1
around the table we went , naming the people , places and opportunities that we appreciated that year			0
it was an exercise in acknowledgment -- and patience			0
the lists could be long			0
my grandmother often had the longest list			1
she had a lot to be grateful for , and this year , these rituals will take on even more meaning as we hope to honor her life , and each other			1
giving thanks we start the meal with a prayer of gratitude for blessings past and present			1
the affirmation sets the stage for the appreciation of what we have , where we are and who helped us get there			0
tell loved ones why you love them it 's often taken for granted that those closest to us know that we love them			1
but it is always nice to be reminded why			0
no matter how old we are , my parents still get excited when their children return for a visit			0
we kids like to roll our eyes , and sure , it can be a little embarrassing , but we love it			2
to have accepting parents that are demonstrative of their love -- no matter their shortcomings -- never gets old			2
let loved ones get to know you what 's great about family is that they know you			1
what 's frustrating about family is that they assume they know everything about you			2
it is the inevitable tension that comes with being known but still yearning to be discovered			0
in the past few years , our family added a new question to the @entity5 discussion : what 's on your bucket list ? my very grounded and sensible brother surprised us all when he shared that he wanted to skydive			1
another mentioned a dream to write books , though they had worked in social work their entire life			0
the lovely surprise about this question is the novel things learned about those that are familiar : an opportunity to get to know who we think we know best all over again			0
share how you want to be remembered after the loss of our grandmother , this ritual will resonate even more this year : we share how we would like to be remembered			1
perhaps because how we perceive ourselves can be different than how others do , this tends to be the most revealing and a window to how we might experience one another			0
" where we aim is n't where we always hit , " my mother likes to say			0
thus , those " encouraging " reminders may be taken as nagging			0
" keeping it real " truth - telling can be experienced as criticism			0
displays of affection can be seen as smothering			0
when all along , it might be that the intention was in the right place and simply misinterpreted			0
when we are gone , loved ones can only relive encounters with us via their memories			2
it can be hard to put into words , but sharing how you want to be remembered -- and living it -- is a gift to loved ones in the time we have together now			1
how would you like to be remembered ? " as a family man , " my dad shared			2
family , dear friends and cherished memories are what i will be remembering at @entity5 this year -- and what i hope to not soon forget .			1
