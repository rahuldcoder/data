-- what 's going on in @entity2 ? it 's been nine days since @entity4 was killed , and his family is still waiting for information from investigators about what happened to their young man			1
eyewitnesses and cell phone videos recount the minutes after his death -- before @entity4 lay dead for five hours , uncovered in the street -- but the state ca n't provide the family with any information ? no state autopsy reports			1
there 's something seriously wrong here			0
imagine having to conduct an autopsy on your son while his body lies in a funeral home so you can know how he died before you bury him			0
the @entity28 was implicated in racial profiling in a 2013 attorney general of @entity32 report , so how can anyone possibly think they would want to investigate one of their own in a shooting ? the @entity38 should have been on hand from the beginning			1
while the @entity42 is deploying to @entity2 , i implore local law enforcement to deploy common sense -- withdraw from the investigation			0
state highway patrol captain @entity46 , appointed to coordinate security operations , has been a tremendously important presence in the community and now we need the same on the prosecutorial side			0
the attorney general should immediately appoint a special prosecutor working jointly with the @entity54			1
the first and " very preliminary " autopsy results have just been released , and they paint a very grim picture of how @entity4 died : he was shot at least six times , including twice in the head , according to acclaimed pathologist dr. @entity62 , who conducted the autopsy at the request of @entity4 's family			1
( let that sink in , the family had to hire a private pathologist to get answers			1
) at least one of the bullets appear to have entered and exited several times , shattering @entity4 's right eye , traveling through his face , leaving through the jawbone and re-entering through his collarbone , said @entity62			1
the final shot was apparently the fatal one , which hit @entity4 on the top of the head			1
with 50 years of experience ( he has conducted some 20,000 autopsies ) , @entity62 spoke with calming authority about his findings ; he said that the state medical examiner was a trusted colleague who would likely make very similar findings			1
but since @entity62 did not have access to @entity4 's clothing ( to examine gun powder residue ) , or x-rays , or witness statements , or toxicology reports ( and i ca n't help but wonder why he was n't given access to this ) , he could not respond to the calls for justice in @entity2			1
he said that @entity4 was shot from anywhere between one foot and 30 feet away			1
he said bullet wounds to @entity4 's arms could have been sustained by @entity4 putting his hands up or making a defensive gesture by crossing his arms			1
from where i sit , six bullets pumped into an unarmed kid in broad daylight is excessive force			0
but that only moves us slightly closer to truth			0
the eyewitness ' accounts vary so widely -- and eyewitness testimony is notoriously unreliable , often refuted by the scientific evidence produced at trial			0
at least one witness , @entity116 , told @entity0 that it " looked as if " the officer tried to pull @entity4 into the car , then was " chasing after the boy " until @entity4 turned around and was shot			1
but others say @entity4 was shot in the back			1
at the moment , the case hinges on the accounts of two conflicting witnesses : @entity125 and officer @entity126			0
@entity46 was walking with @entity4 when the shooting occurred and gave this account , reported by @entity129 : @entity46 said a police officer approached as he and @entity4 were walking in the middle of the street and told them to use the sidewalk			1
they complied , and the officer began to drive away , but then threw his car into reverse and came back alongside the teens , nearly hitting them			0
@entity46 said he heard @entity126 say something like " what 'd you say ? " before trying to open his car door and slamming it into @entity4			2
then , @entity46 said , the officer reached out and grabbed @entity4 by the neck with his left hand			2
the two men struggled briefly , and then @entity126 , still in his car , shot @entity4 once , @entity46 said			2
@entity46 said that he and @entity4 " took off running together , " but @entity4 was shot a second time " striking him in the back , " he said			2
after the second shot , @entity4 turned around , putting his hands in the air and saying , " i do n't have a gun			1
stop shooting ! " according to @entity46			0
he said that @entity126 then approached @entity4 and fired several more shots until he " crumbled into a fetal position			2
" as the news conference for the autopsy was taking place , a caller to a @entity161 radio station , who identified herself only as " @entity163 , " told listeners she knew @entity126 's side of the story			1
here is a summary of what she said : he says the boys were walking in the street , @entity126 rolled the window down and told them to get out of street			0
@entity126 may have called for backup when he pulled over			0
he heard the call for the strong armed robbery and saw the teens carrying something that might have been cigars			0
he pulled over and when he tried to get out of the car , twice he was pushed back into the car by @entity4			2
@entity4 then punched him in the face and @entity126 reached for his gun			2
@entity4 grabbed the gun and at one point had the gun pushed again @entity126 's hip so @entity126 pushed the gun away and the gun went off			2
@entity4 and his friend ran and @entity126 got out of the car and pursued			2
he told them to freeze and @entity194 and his friend turned around			0
@entity4 started to taunt him , then bum rushed @entity126 , coming at him full speed			2
@entity126 said the final shot was in the forehead and @entity4 fell two or three feet in front of the officer			0
a source with detailed knowledge of the investigation into the shooting told @entity0 that " this account is accurate			0
" where witness accounts differ , an autopsy can provide certainty , as it will allow us to recreate the crime scene and -- with certainty -- know how far apart the men where , what @entity4 was doing when he was shot and whether he ever had his hand on @entity126 's gun			1
there was one important question that @entity62 could answer for certain			0
@entity4 's mother wanted to know whether her son had suffered when he died			0
@entity62 assured her that the bullet to the head had rendered him unconscious and in his opinion " he had not suffered			0
" i hope the local authorities recuse themselves from the investigation and turn it over to a special prosecutor with the attorney general			1
and for crying out loud , hurry up and complete the three autopsies , the investigation and the grand jury proceedings			0
what @entity2 and @entity4 's family need right now are answers , and until we have them , there will be nothing but more heartbreak , chaos and uncertainty .			1

@entity246 : 9 days later , investigators still have n't told @entity4 family what happened
@entity38 should have been there from start ; attorney general should tap special prosecutor , she says
she says *confusing* story has varying accounts ; investigators should tell what they know
@entity246 : @entity62 autopsy best information family has gotten so far ; they need more answers
