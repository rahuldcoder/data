-- if body language is a good gauge of political standing , @entity1 is looking very much like @entity6 's premier - in - waiting			1
last monday , vice premier @entity1 delivered the keynote speech at the @entity8 , a meeting of business and political leaders held yearly in southern @entity13 province			1
looking relaxed and confident , he ad - libbed briefly , gesticulating with both hands before he read his prepared speech			0
" @entity6 's reform has entered a crucial juncture " , @entity1 said , stressing that " reform and innovation " are the driving force to promote economic and social development			1
@entity1 said reforms will focus on taxation , finance , prices and income distribution			2
no big pronouncements , no off - the - cuff remarks , no mistakes			0
barring unforeseen political reversals , @entity1 ( whose name is pronounced @entity34 - cheeyahng ) is expected to become the @entity6 premier in march next year , succeeding @entity36			1
as the current executive vice premier , @entity1 already oversees important portfolios , such macro economic planning , health care , energy and housing			1
he is already making an impact			0
unlike his predecessors , @entity1 's speaks fairly good @entity45			1
when he visited @entity46 last year , he delivered part of his speech in @entity45 -- a gesture that prompted debate in the mainland			1
video clips of his speech went viral on social media			0
some netizens thought it was " inappropriate " that he spoke in @entity45			2
others praised him for " open - mindedness " and for breaking away from the stoic style of @entity6 leaders			2
how far @entity1 will break away from old conventions , experts say , remains uncertain			1
@entity1 is considered a carbon copy of president @entity63 , his mentor and benefactor , because of similarities in background , priorities and style			1
the son of a minor county official in @entity71 , a poor province where @entity63 was also born , @entity1 was a teenager when the decade - long @entity72 interrupted his schooling			1
as an educated youth who need " reeducation through labor " , he worked on the farm for four years			0
there , at age 21 , he joined the @entity80			0
in early 1978 , less than two years after chairman @entity81 died , he entered @entity82 to study law -- a discipline which in earlier years was reviled as " bourgeois			0
" @entity82 in the late 1970s was a hub of intellectual and political ferment			0
i saw that up close when i studied there from 1977 - 81			0
@entity6 then was at the end of the @entity93 era and the beginning of @entity96 's reform			2
inside and outside classrooms , students and faculty debated big topics like " where to , @entity6 ? " " like everyone in our generation @entity1 was keen for new ideas , " recalls @entity101 , an international politics major			1
" he had the social experience from the @entity72 , so he was also pragmatic			0
" @entity1 collaborated with @entity101 and another student in translating " the @entity109 , " a book on constitutional law by the noted @entity113 judge lord @entity112			2
" he was smart , intelligent and hard - working , " recalls @entity114 , a former law - school classmate and now a partner at @entity117 law firm			0
" he was already a student leader at that time			0
" in 1980 , @entity82 held competitive elections for " people 's representatives " to the local legislature			0
@entity1 did not stand for elections -- he happened to have an off - campus internship -- but as chairman of the student federation he spent time with politically active students like @entity126 , who campaigned but failed to get a seat			1
" he had the typical traits of @entity82 students then -- idealistic and independent , at times very out - spoken about certain issues , " recalled @entity126 in a recent essay			0
after graduation , @entity1 decided to work for the @entity134 ( @entity134 ) , a training ground for party and government officials			2
" since then , we 've stepped on different paths and our paths rarely crossed , " wrote @entity126			0
" in the 1980s , as the @entity134 cadre in charge of student movement he handled several incidents , still in the old style like his college days -- control the scale of protests but never resort to political prosecution			0
" in 1989 , however , their paths went in different directions			0
@entity1 rose through the ranks of @entity134 while completing a master 's degree in law and then an economics doctorate under @entity158 , the guru of market reforms in @entity6			1
@entity126 was jailed as a " black hand " for his role in the student protests that culminated in the bloody @entity164 crackdown			0
@entity126 has been in exile in the @entity166 since 1994 and is now co-chair of the @entity168 , which advocates radical change in @entity6			2
at @entity134 , @entity1 's career intersected with @entity63 , who headed @entity134 for many years			1
under @entity63 's patronage , @entity1 has been on a fast track to the top			1
in 1998 , @entity1 at 43 became @entity175 's provincial governor , the youngest in @entity6			1
his brief stint there led to criticisms related to an outbreak of @entity180 when the government - run blood banks infected tens of thousands of blood - sellers , some with @entity185			0
most of the infections actually happened before @entity1 arrived in @entity175 , but critics accused him of tolerating the cover - up of the scandal			2
@entity1 also survived three major fire accidents in @entity175			2
in 2004 , he was appointed party chief of @entity193 , a rust - belt province in northeast @entity6 , and was tasked with reviving its ailing state - owned enterprises			1
as @entity6 's executive vice premier , @entity1 remains a stalwart supporter of @entity63 's " seek a harmonious society " dictum			1
he advocates social equity and is skeptical of bureaucracy			0
a confidential @entity166 , embassy memo published on the @entity205 website describes @entity1 telling the then - @entity166 ambassador in @entity207 that local economic data are " for reference only			2
" he acknowledged official corruption as the biggest source of public anger and thought the effective solution was to create transparent rules and adequate supervision			0
like his mentor @entity63 , @entity1 has risen to his high position more by avoiding big mistakes than through bold ideas and major accomplishments			1
still , in substance and in style , expectations are high			0
@entity6 microblogger " @entity224 " tweeted : " @entity1 is a better speaker than many @entity6 top leaders but still needs to work on his stage presentation and body language			1
it 's part of @entity6 's national image ! "			1

@entity1 is expected to become @entity6 premier next march
in a @entity234 speech last year , he delivered part of it in @entity45
whether he will break away from old conventions is not clear , @entity238 writes
@entity1 hails from the same province -- @entity71 -- as his mentor , @entity6 president @entity63
