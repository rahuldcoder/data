-- @entity1 is not a name many associate with commercial flight			2
the @entity5 plane manufacturer , which for years has based its business on its smaller , regional jets , has not traditionally been in a position to challenge the likes of @entity10 and @entity11 when it comes to providing larger carriers			1
all of that could to change , however , as the company is scheduled to test fly its first c - series jet this june			1
@entity1 is banking a lot on their new planes , which cost them $ 3.4 billion to produce			1
the sizable investment seems paltry , however , when compared to the size of the market they hope to penetrate : aircraft that seat 100 to 150 make up a $ 2 trillion industry			1
@entity1 is hoping to scoop up half of that			0
with their c - series priced considerably below their competition ( the $ 61 million price tag is 30 % cheaper than what @entity10 and @entity11 charge for similar models ) , they stand a pretty good chance			1
" it 's an aggressive world			0
we 've got to differentiate ourselves with the right product , " notes @entity35 , the president of @entity36			0
the company claims the new planes will not only burn 20 % less fuel , but will also have 25 % fewer operating cost than their rivals '			1
they 've already pulled in over 350 orders , with @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 first in line to add the planes to their fleet			1
first , however , the new planes need to undergo certification , a process that is expected to be much more stringent in light of the recent problems of the @entity56			2
@entity57 , the vice president and general manager of @entity1 's c - series , insists they are n't jumping the gun			1
" it 's actually a thin line where you have to support the flight test plan as fast as you can , give yourself the flexibility to introduce any changes that may arise , and at the same time be ready to ramp up the production aircraft as soon as possible , " he says			1
moreover , he expects the new planes will pass with flying colors			2
" we already have a very rigorous process			0
we throttle ( each plane ) more than any aircraft will see in its entire history			1
we pull ( the wings ) up , pull them down , add weight to them and take them right to the point of breaking			0
" the planes , he says , must be 150 % stronger than the worst forces they could face during a flight			2
furthermore , when presented with the opportunity to use a lithium battery back in 2011 , @entity1 instead opted for something more conventional			0
" we studied ( the battery ) quite extensively , " says @entity57			0
" we decided in the end that the technology was really not mature for us			0
it was a risk versus reward ( scenario ) , and there was a lot of perceived risk			0
" the company has also introduced a couple of features that will make flying easier and safer for pilots , most notably the screen area in the flight deck is more than double the surface area than on other aircraft			1
" the advantage of that is that you can have more information available to the pilot directly , without having to cascade menus , " explains @entity57			0
" you always want to lower the pilot 's workload so that he can really manage the aircraft well			2
" it 's too early to tell if @entity1 's gamble on the new series will pay off , but @entity115 is optimistic about their chances			2
" we 've just started to fight , " he says			0
" we said we were going to have about 300 firm orders when the aircraft goes into service			1
we are well on our way to achieving that objective			0
