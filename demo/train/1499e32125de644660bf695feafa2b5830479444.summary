@entity6 has withdrawn her name from consideration for @entity9 's @entity8 seat			1
the source told @entity0 that @entity4 did not think @entity6 was " ready for prime time , " citing her efforts , at times awkward , to try to win the appointment			1
" she clearly has no policy experience and could n't handle the pressure , " said the source , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation			0
" why would he pick her given how badly she handled herself in recent weeks ? " @entity6 , 51 , cited personal reasons for her decision not to continue pursuing the @entity8 seat			1
she informed the media at midnight , as wednesday turned to thursday			0
@entity4 is charged with naming a replacement for @entity30 , who resigned her seat to become the secretary of state in president @entity35 's administration			1
@entity4 will appoint someone to hold the seat until a new election is held in 2010			2
a @entity6 ally , though , denied @entity6 had any indication @entity4 was leaning against choosing her to fill out @entity30 's term			1
and another @entity6 confidante said @entity6 allies are getting frustrated about what they perceive as the governor 's insiders slighting her			2
@entity4 , who is expected to name his choice friday , has been coy about who he will pick to replace @entity30			2
@entity6 had been very public in expressing her interest in the seat by meeting with state and community leaders throughout the state			2
her uncle , sen. @entity54 , @entity55 , was rushed to the hospital on tuesday following @entity35 's swearing - in ceremony			0
but an aide to @entity6 indicated sen. @entity6 's health was not the reason she decided to withdraw			2
by early thursday afternoon , there was still confusion over how and why @entity6 withdrew her name from consideration			2
the source close to the governor told @entity0 that @entity6 initially called @entity4 in the afternoon to tell him that " she was feeling unsure about her candidacy " and " asked him for 24 hours to think about it			1
" a @entity6 aide said that during the call with the governor , it was @entity4 who told her to take more time to think about her decision			1
later wednesday evening , the governor started getting phone calls from the media saying they heard she had withdrawn			0
at around 11 p.m. et , the source close to the governor said @entity6 called @entity4 and " said she was issuing a statement saying she was in the race			1
" one hour later , the source said @entity6 issued a statement withdrawing from the race			1
@entity4 's office finally addressed the matter late thursday afternoon in a prepared statement			2
" last night @entity6 informed the governor that she was withdrawing her name from consideration for an appointment to the @entity8 for personal reasons , " @entity4 's office said			1
" this decision was hers alone			0
" @entity4 's office acknowledged the wednesday afternoon conversation between the governor and @entity6 , but did not divulge what was said			1
" out of respect for her decision making process , the governor 's @entity101 did not respond to any inquiries in order to allow her time to deliberate , " @entity4 's office said in the statement			1
" the governor considers @entity6 a friend and knows she will continue to serve @entity3 well inside or outside of government			2
we wish her well in all her future endeavors			0
" @entity4 's office also noted that he is " now entering the final phase of his selection process			2
" @entity6 was widely considered the front - runner to replace @entity30 , who won the @entity119 seat in 2000 , and almost all of the buzz about a replacement centered around her			0
but as the weeks dragged on , polling showed her popularity among @entity124 dwindling			0

however , " celebrity magazines and cocktail party chatter do n't build support for senators , " @entity130 national committeeman and @entity0 contributor @entity129 said thursday			0

her handlers " did n't demonstrate they had a real plan of action , " he said thursday			0
" the disorganized way she dropped out was reflective of the very disorganized campaign she pursued in seeking the @entity8 seat , " he added			0
@entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 have also been mentioned as possible replacements for @entity30			0
all three drew single - digit support in the january poll			0
@entity4 's office also said the governor had not obtained any information during the selection process that might prompt a candidate to withdraw			0
there has been much speculation as to why @entity6 , a member of @entity35 's vice presidential search committee , withdrew her name			0
despite the governor 's public statement , a source close to @entity4 told @entity0 that @entity6 did have potentially embarrassing issues including problems with her taxes and with her nanny			1
people who move in @entity3 political circles were buzzing thursday about the endless finger pointing between people loyal to @entity4 and those loyal to @entity6			1
contacted by @entity0 to address the allegations of problems with taxes and a nanny , @entity6 's spokesman @entity174 said in a prepared statement : " @entity6 withdrew her name for consideration from the @entity8 for personal reasons			1
any statements to the contrary are false			0
