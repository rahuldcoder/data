@entity0 -- did @entity3 @entity2 have too much bubbly on @entity4 and pass a bill to avert the fiscal cliff that some in the @entity8 insist includes too much in new taxes without cutting spending ? are @entity11 @entity2 so stubborn in their pursuit of spending cuts that they 're ready to go to war with members of their own party ? in trying to avoid the fiscal cliff , @entity11 and @entity3 @entity2 put the @entity19 -- and the country -- on the brink of a political one			1
it 's never good for party unity when a @entity11 lawmaker jokes that his @entity3 colleagues passed a late - night measure because of " partying and revelry and drinking " in the wee hours			1
yet , that 's what @entity34 representative and @entity36 chairman @entity33 said in an interview on @entity1 's " @entity39			2
" when @entity40 asked @entity33 if he was suggesting that @entity3 @entity2 were drunk when they voted , @entity33 backtracked and said : " of course not			1
i was just having a little fun with you , @entity44			0
this guy must be the life of the party			0
but the rest of us still have to wonder whether , after the raucous fiscal cliff negotiations , his party has any life left in it			1
politics : debt debate starts now the @entity11 adjourned on monday without voting on a bill to avoid the automatic tax hikes and deep spending cuts set to take place that midnight			1
the @entity3 burned the midnight oil and passed -- by a vote of 89 to 8 -- an emergency bill with more than $ 600 billion in new revenue over 10 years			1
the legislation also allowed the @entity66 - era tax cuts to expire for families making more than $ 450,000 annually			0
on @entity68 , @entity11 @entity2 struck back and rejected the @entity3 bill as insufficient in its spending cuts			1
only 85 @entity2 voted in favor , while 151 voted against			2
with plenty of @entity75 support , the measure passed			0
but it was over the objections of most @entity2 , who will surely fight for more cuts in spending during the fast - approaching debt ceiling negotiations			1
the bigger drama is still playing out			0
we 're seeing a civil war between @entity2 , although at this point you really ca n't call it " civil			2
" this is not a simple difference of opinion that can be papered over by inserting a few paragraphs into a bill			0
this is about different visions for what republicans think their role should be when they 're out of power			0
speaking of power , house speaker @entity97 appears to be fresh out			1
after failing to get enough support from those in his own party for an alternative plan in the @entity11 , @entity97 wound up going " all in " on passing a bill			1
he must have thought that his speakership depended on not coming up empty - handed			0
politics : are the days of @entity108 ' going big ' over ? but @entity97 might have lost a good deal of the support and confidence of his @entity113 colleagues			1
the formal vote on whether to keep him in the speaker 's chair is set for thursday			1
@entity11 majority leader @entity118 just might be biding his time in the wings , after he split from @entity97 and voted no on the @entity3 bill			1
@entity97 let the pressure get to him			2
just ask senate majority leader @entity124 , who is never at a loss for words , and usually the wrong ones			0
@entity124 accused of @entity97 of running the @entity11 like a " dictatorship			1
" so when @entity97 happened to bump into @entity124 , a few days before the fiscal cliff deadline , in a hallway of the @entity132 , witnesses say the speaker told the @entity75 majority leader to " go f --- yourself			1
it also does n't help build support or confidence in the speaker that he has proved to be no match for the chess skills of president @entity146 , who always seems to have a pretty good idea of the opposition 's next move			2
so , when @entity146 staged a press event on @entity4 to press for higher taxes on the wealthy as the @entity11 was deliberating , he had to know that the stunt would scuttle the process			2
that would have sent us over the cliff and ensure that @entity2 got the blame			2
the trouble is , that 's not leadership			0
on this issue , as with many others , @entity146 the @entity165 confuses the two			0
to avoid the fiscal cliff , @entity3 @entity2 offered a @entity169 ; those in the @entity11 wanted to treat the wound			1
it would have been no excuse for shirking their duty and not passing a bill , but the @entity2 in the lower chamber were on the right track			2
we have to deal sooner or later with the federal government 's runaway spending , but there 's no appetite for that in @entity108			1
in fact , for all the talk about whether to raise taxes on the wealthy , the real sticking point in this debate was what to do about spending we can no longer afford -- especially on programs such as @entity192 and @entity193			0
politics : new congress tackles old leftovers lawmakers in both parties , who respect and fear the senior citizen lobby , wo n't have this conversation			0
so they would just as soon keep @entity202 distracted with an argument over who should pay what in taxes			0
do n't be taken in			0
what @entity202 should really be thinking about at this moment is where all that money is going and whether we can keep paying those bills no matter how high the tax rates soar			0
remember how it works with your own household budget			0
it 's not only how much comes in that matters ; just as important is how much goes out			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity222 .			2

@entity222 : @entity3 and @entity11 @entity2 are warring over fiscal policy
@entity222 : @entity8 offered a band - aid for fiscal cliff ; @entity11 @entity8 wanted to treat the wound
he says the @entity11 @entity8 is on the right track in trying to cut back federal spending
@entity97 's role as speaker could be *damaged* by his vote on fiscal deal , he says
