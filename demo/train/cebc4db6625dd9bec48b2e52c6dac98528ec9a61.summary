-- jurors in the capital murder trial of @entity3 had a front - row seat this week to the vivid yet imaginary world the @entity7 mother created in the weeks after 2 - year - old daughter @entity3 disappeared in 2008			1
the jury heard detailed stories from her mother , her brother and finally , @entity13 herself , of her business trips to @entity15 and visits to an old flame that later proved to be false			1
through recordings of @entity13 's police interviews , jailhouse visits and a 911 call , the silent woman at the defense table finally spoke			1
throughout the conversations , one sentiment is conveyed to @entity13 again and again : stop lying , or face the worst of consequences			2
@entity7 prosecutors say the lies did not end , and now @entity13 could face the death penalty			1
she is charged with seven counts , including first - degree murder , aggravated child abuse and misleading police in the 2008 death of daughter @entity3			1
the last time the little girl was seen was june 16 , 2008			0
she was not reported missing until july 15 , 2008 , by @entity3 , @entity3 's mother			2
her body was found in december 2008 , in a wooded area less than a mile from the @entity43 home in eastern @entity44			0
@entity13 , 25 , has denied harming her daughter or having anything to do with the little girl 's disappearance or death			1
her lawyer has said that once all the facts were known , it will become clear his client is innocent			0
in a july 16 , 2008 , police interview , which the jury heard thursday , @entity44 sheriff 's sgt. @entity54 told @entity13 the time had come to reveal the truth			1
" by burying this ... you are not going to get yourself to a better place , ok , " @entity54 said			0
" what you 're going to do is you 're going to cause everybody else around you to suffer			0
and at some point this is going to come out ; it always does			0
" after arrest , @entity3 insisted focus was on finding @entity3 @entity13 heard the same sentiment again during in a jailhouse phone call to her mother , also on july 16 , 2008			1
when @entity13 blames her mother for her being in jail , @entity3 fights back			1
" well , whose fault is your sitting in the jail ? " she asked her daughter			0
" blame yourself for telling lies			0
" the excuses testimony earlier in the trial , which began last week in @entity85 , @entity7 , revealed that @entity13 lied to her parents and avoided them for 31 days in the summer of 2008 while @entity3 was supposedly missing			1
this week , jurors learned more about what @entity13 told her parents during that time and what she was actually doing			1
from the witness stand tuesday , @entity13 's mother described heated confrontations with her daughter on july 15 , 2008 , after she learned she had been lying about her whereabouts for a month			1
those stories began with @entity13 saying she was having a sleepover with a nanny named @entity99			1
then , @entity13 was out of town on a work trip to @entity15			1
by the fourth week , @entity13 's story was that she was out of town visiting an old boyfriend named @entity106			1
@entity3 caught her daughter in her lies by discovering she was , in fact , in @entity109 with a different boyfriend			1
by the time her mother called 911 to report @entity3 mising , @entity13 had a new story			1
" i know who has her			0
she 's been my nanny for about a year - and - a - half , almost two years , " @entity13 told the operator in the july 15 , 2008 , call , which jurors heard tuesday			1
when asked by the operator why she waited so long to report her daughter missing , @entity117 replied , " i have been looking for her and have gone through other resources to try to find her , which was stupid			2
" the characters in the following days , @entity99 's alleged role would expand from an occasionally mentioned nanny to a central character in @entity3 's disappearance			1
when initially questioned by @entity44 detective @entity126 on july 16 , 2008 , about @entity99 , @entity13 provided a description of her without hesitation			2
that interview was played wednesday			0
@entity13 said she 'd known @entity131 for four years after they met working together at @entity133			1
she provided a physical description of @entity99 , her address , even her mother 's name			0
other characters were also fleshed out			0
@entity106 , a former @entity133 co-worker , according to @entity117 , lived in @entity139 and had a son named @entity141 who played with @entity3			1
and then there was @entity143 , another co-worker at @entity133 , who now lived in @entity145 , @entity13 said			2
she also had a daughter @entity3 's age			1
@entity13 claimed she called @entity148 and @entity106 when she realized caylee was missing			2
but prosecutors claim @entity13 was not looking for her daughter in the month she was missing			1
instead , she was staying with her boyfriend , spending time in @entity109 with friends , attending parties , going shopping and hitting nightclubs , according to testimony from friends , her former boyfriend , and acquaintances , who also said that she did not mention her daughter being missing during that time			0
@entity13 's frustration level with her parents , particularly her mother , was rising around the time @entity3 disappeared , friend @entity161 testified tuesday			1
friend : @entity3 was ' frustrated ' with mother " i remember she told me her mom had told her she was an unfit mother			1
she was extremely upset about that			0
" but @entity13 also was agitated at her mother because she had to cancel plans " fairly frequently " when no one was available to watch her daughter , @entity161 testified			2
in late june , @entity161 said , @entity13 told her that she was keeping @entity3 away from her parents , as they were having marital problems and were considering divorce , and " she wanted to keep @entity3 out of the drama			1
" ' fessing up on thursday , @entity126 described the day @entity13 was finally forced to admit her lies , at least in part			2
on july 16 , 2008 , @entity126 worked with @entity133 to scour the employee database			0
@entity13 was in the database , but she had n't been affiliated with @entity133 for years			2
@entity126 also found no record of @entity99 or @entity148			0
a @entity183 was found , but never worked for the company at the same time as @entity117			0
@entity99 's supposed apartment had also been found vacant			0
@entity13 voluntarily met @entity126 at @entity133 to discuss the matter			2
@entity126 testified thursday that he watched @entity13 try to enter the park without a badge then attempted to lead him to her office before being forced to admit she did n't have one			2
" i can tell you just for certainty everything you 've told me so far has been a lie , " @entity126 said in a recorded interview played for the jury on thursday			2
" i 've gone to every address that you 've told me			0
i 've looked up every name , i 've talked to every person that you wanted me to talk or try to			0
and found out all these names you 're giving me are people that either never worked here or been fired a long time ago , ok			0
" @entity13 conceded she did n't work at @entity133 and that the people she had described as her co-workers did not exist			0
yet she continued to blame @entity99 for the disappearance of her child			0
the breakdown : @entity3 's " imaginary friends " @entity3 said her daughter had been telling her about @entity99 along with numerous other people -- a boyfriend , a co-worker and a man named @entity217 , whom she believed to be @entity3 's father -- for years before @entity3 went missing			1
at the time , she said , she never had a reason to believe those people were fictitious			0
" i just found out they were imaginary people , " she testified			0
a @entity222 was later found , but she had no affiliation with @entity13 aside from having filled out a guest card at the @entity109 apartment complex where @entity13 claimed the nanny lived			2
the apartment where @entity13 said @entity99 lived was found to be vacant , and there was no record of @entity99 in the @entity133 employee database			0
as week two concludes , it now appears @entity54 was right in his prediction that @entity13 's stories ultimately would lead to suffering for others			0
however , it is yet to be seen whether the second part of his prophecy will be realized : that the truth will come out .			0
