in fact , most of the country just moved an hour forward			1
the time change coincides with the conclusion of the @entity7 , known as @entity7			1
the activists attending the conference are the @entity11 's shock troops , but some @entity11 strategists do n't want them to shock mainstream voters this fall			1
still , the gathering proved somewhat of a litmus test for a schizophrenic conservative base trying to figure out where it stands as the 2014 midterms approach , all the while struggling with change in a country that is changing quite rapidly			1
it tells you something that one of the biggest applause lines of @entity7 was n't even an applause line			1
it occurred when @entity29 senate leader @entity29 held a rifle on stage			1
( the rifle was presented to sen. @entity33			1
) it also tells you something that @entity37 gov. @entity36 was invited to @entity7 this year , now that he is embroiled in the @entity39 scandal , but he was not invited last year , when he was on his way to re-election in a @entity43 state			1
it seems like @entity7 's test is whether you 're making the right enemies			1
if the mainstream media is going after you , then @entity7 will invite you			1
@entity36 's @entity7 speech was directed to the conservative @entity11 base ; he did n't talk beyond them , to a wider audience , as he did last year when he was running for re-election			1
he referred repeatedly to his anti-abortion positions			2
he attacked the news media and defended the @entity57 brothers			2
but in between the back - slapping and pontificating in the ballrooms and back rooms at @entity7 , a new rift emerged inside the @entity11			2
there appears to be a real division and a real debate in the @entity11 between the isolationists and the interventionists			1
in 1952 , it was between sen. @entity67 and gen. @entity68			2
that debate still is n't settled			2
in order for president @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 to be moderates , they just have to present themselves between the extremes of @entity78 sen. @entity77 's isolationism and @entity81 sen. @entity80 's hawkishness — the difference between living in a cave or conducting ourselves so that we 're in need of one			2
and , so far , the conservatives at the conference seemed to be picking up what @entity77 was laying down			1
in the annual @entity7 straw poll , @entity77 appeared to be as popular as his father , former rep. @entity92 , was in 2010			2
@entity77 won 31 % of the votes this year ( but history shows @entity7 straw polls are n't always the best predictors of who will be nominated )			2
sen. @entity98 of @entity99 , who used his time before @entity7 to imply that former @entity11 presidential nominee @entity101 was unprincipled , got 11 %			2
@entity80 , who came in second in 2013 , took a nosedive after recommending mild reform of immigration laws , and placed seventh with 6 %			0
@entity98 clearly displayed a tin ear and a lack of basic humanity by attacking " president @entity101 " as a failed moderate nominee , now that @entity101 , an @entity111 hero , is in his 90s and out of politics			0
@entity98 is clearly running against the @entity115 @entity11 establishment			0
this strategy may serve him well until the point in the primaries when establishment figures like @entity120 will unleash millions in negative commercials , the likes of which sank @entity124			0
meanwhile , @entity99 gov. @entity125 gave a pulse - quickening speech that brought the crowd to its feet			0
@entity125 praised @entity11 governors and hit @entity115 , saying , " it is time for @entity115 to focus on the few things the @entity132 establishes as the federal government 's role			0
... defend our country , provide a cogent foreign policy , and what the heck , deliver the mail , preferably on time and on saturdays			0
" @entity125 may have forgotten that the @entity142 has been independent of @entity143 since 1971 and is run , by law , as a " revenue neutral " ( nonprofit ) agency			0
he also apparently forgot the clauses " insure domestic tranquility " and " promote for the general welfare			0
" @entity125 also ignored the duties of @entity143 , which is just as well			0
the third branch of government is , by political strategy , so gridlocked that it has all but ceased to function			0
@entity125 's emphasis on the role of governors underscores the political reality that mayors , governors and the president must engage in executive workarounds for this nonfunctioning @entity143			0
the @entity11 has been struggling to attract minorities for decades			1
the party was trounced by the @entity43 , who in 2012 got 93 % of the @entity166 - @entity111 vote , 73 % of the @entity168 vote and 71 % of the @entity170 vote			1
@entity7 held a panel discussion on minority outreach ; a photo 10 minutes into the event embarrassingly showed row upon row upon row of empty chairs			0
the @entity11 did poorly in its outreach to female voters in 2012 , who voted 55 % for @entity71 and only 44 % for @entity11 @entity182			0
in 2014 , at @entity7 , attention to the ladies was also wanting			1
@entity186 writer @entity185 took a challenge from @entity7 's chairman , @entity188 , to count the number of male and female speakers at @entity7			0
it came out lopsidedly for the men — by 78 %			0
by definition , conservatives struggle with change			1
@entity7 was proof of the old saying that " the more things change , the more they stay the same			0
" join us on @entity199 / @entity198			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity202 .			1

@entity202 : conservatives trying to figure out where they stand as 2014 midterms approach
some see themselves as isolationists , while others call for intervention
the party is still struggling to attract women and minorities
