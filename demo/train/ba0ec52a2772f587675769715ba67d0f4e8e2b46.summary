-- in june , @entity1 , the man behind the proposed ground zero mosque , was asked on live radio if he believed @entity4 is a terrorist organization			1
this is n't a difficult question : @entity4 employs suicide bombers and fires incendiary rockets at civilian targets within @entity10			2
it calls for the destruction of the jewish state followed by the establishment of a potentially fundamentalist and repressive regime			0
governments all over the world , including the @entity18 and the @entity19 , rightfully consider @entity4 to be a terrorist organization that willfully and indiscriminately targets innocent civilians			1
yet @entity1 , after being asked this simple , straightforward question , refused to state whether or not he believed @entity4 to be a terrorist organization			1
he said : " i will not allow anybody to put me in a position where i am seen by any party in the world as an adversary or as an enemy			0
" now @entity1 wants to build and lead a $ 100 million , 13 - story community center and mosque			1
it would be constructed on property currently occupied by a historic 150 - year - old building that was seriously damaged by the landing gear of one of the hijacked jetliners that flew into the @entity36 on september 11 , 2001 , and he wants to unveil it on september 11 , 2011			0
i oppose the center and mosque 's construction because i believe there should be an investigation into the sources of its funding			1
the main group behind its construction , @entity47 , which is headed by the @entity1 , is a registered charity in @entity49			1
it is the responsibility of @entity49 's attorney general @entity51 to ensure the mosque 's funding is coming from reputable sources			1
the radio show comments were not the first time @entity1 has said troubling things or been associated with troubling activities			2
on @entity60 ' " @entity59 , " less than a month after the attacks , he said @entity18 policies were an " accessory " to the crime of 9/11			0
" in fact , " he added , " in the most direct sense , @entity67 is made in the @entity18			0
" @entity1 is also listed on the website of the @entity69 as a " role player and contributor			2
" this group was a financial backer of the @entity75 flotilla , which attempted in may to break the @entity10 's blockade of @entity75			0
the @entity47 has reported less than $ 20,000 in assets			2
where the $ 100 million for his project would come from is anybody 's guess			0
furthermore , it 's fair to ask why , exactly , @entity1 has insisted on building the mosque so close to ground zero , and why he wants to unveil it on the 10th anniversary of the attacks			1
this not an issue of religious freedom , but rather , a question of safety and security			0
@entity93 deserve to be safe and to feel safe , and we have a right to know who 's footing the bill for @entity1 's project			1
are foreign governments or other organizations involved ? and why is there such secrecy about the source of the money ? the @entity47 is legally required to file disclosure reports with the office of the attorney general , and it could easily be asked under state law to open its books for the office if @entity51 would simply make that request			1
we need to know who is paying for the center and mosque			0
we need to know what their motives are , and we need to know if the @entity1 is promising any potential benefactors anything in return for their support			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity125 .			0

@entity125 says the @entity1 behind the planned @entity127 refused to call @entity4 terrorist
@entity130 : other associations also make him wary of center 's funding sources
he says @entity93 have a right to know where money is coming from to feel safe
@entity130 : the state attorney general should request @entity47 open its books
