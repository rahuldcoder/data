-- here 's where things went wrong : on tuesday , january 28 , 2014 , at 1:30 in the afternoon , in response to the sparkle of several snowflakes in the air above @entity10 , virtually the entire adult population of @entity5 's ninth most populous metro area stood up , left their workplaces , got into their cars , and created a traffic deadlock of legendary proportions			1
good news for @entity19 gov. @entity18 that he was nowhere near here at the time , nor could he be linked via administrative assistants to our wintry surprise			1
but among @entity23 of the @entity24 , move over @entity25 , @entity19			1
my friend @entity26 , a @entity28 grad student , tried to leave her parking place on a downtown parking deck and traveled -- in one hour and seven minutes -- 23 feet			2
my friend @entity31 posted on @entity32 : " six hours and 18 minutes to get home from @entity34			1
wish my car made it , too			2
" my husband 's law partner , @entity37 , inched along @entity39 north toward home from 5 p.m. tuesday until 1 a.m. wednesday , at which point his car ran out of gas			1
he abandoned it and set off on foot through the snowdrifts , reaching his home at 2 in the morning			1
what other cities can learn from @entity10 's ice debacle by all accounts -- i was n't going out there -- the city 's throughways on wednesday looked like parking lots , where cars with empty gas tanks sat frozen in the @entity58 air			1
( it was 16 degrees fahrenheit wednesday morning			1
) some of the cars had been abandoned ; others might have still had people in them			2
" if you are stranded and can not get through to 911 , " announced the @entity63 , " please send the @entity63 a message through @entity32 or @entity66			1
" one can only imagine : # @entity68			2
a special @entity32 page , " @entity70 , " was created to connect the cold , stranded , and demoralized with the warm , housebound , and generous			1
people in vast traffic jams , with taillights twinkling in endless lines toward every horizon , not only sat in cars steadily running out of gas , they called for help and comfort on cell phones running out of juice			1
thus most people seeking help online did so for third parties : " my boyfriend has been stuck in traffic for nine hours now , " wrote a woman named @entity87			1
" he has a heart condition and told me he 's starting to feel lightheaded			1
" some posted longingly : " my husband left work yesterday at 4 p.m , " a woman wrote in at 9 a.m. wednesday morning			0
" of all days he left his phone at home			1
... he had no means of getting in touch with me			0
if anyone has seen or heard from him , please reply			0
" scores of people wrote to offer beds and meals to freezing , stranded travelers			1
many offered to drive to pickup points to meet the strangers			0
@entity111 announced all stores would remain open all night , offering warmth and shelter			0
photos surfaced of people in their business clothes asleep on the floor in the aisles of @entity121 drugstores			0
a bakery owner offered to donate goods to any place stranded people were gathering			2
" warm home , food , and phone to anyone who needs it ! " posted a woman in @entity127 , @entity128			2
was @entity10 asleep at the wheel ? " my sister has been stuck in her car since 4:30 p.m. yesterday , " posted a woman named @entity138 on wednesday , 17 hours after her sister got on the road			1
she 's nearly out of gas			2
does not have her meds			0
can someone please help ? she 's at @entity147 by @entity148			2
please somebody ? " " lawd i 'm praying ! " was the first response , from a woman named @entity152 , after which a woman named @entity154 posted : " i can walk to her ! call me			0
trying to find insulin ! " then : " sending people that way now			0
what kind of car and where ? " " @entity163 - brown @entity162			2
she made it to the gas station across from @entity167			0
" " my friend @entity168 is walking that way right now			0
" " thank you ! you found her ! " posted @entity138 ; then , a bit later : " she made it home ! praise @entity175 ! ! ... good people still left in this world ! " the landscapes and language of apocalypse -- many headlines compared @entity10 to a scene in " @entity184 " -- bore no relation to the footage , the yardage , the square ... inchage of snow actually dumped on the city			1
how much snow fell ? what quantity of snow do you think it takes to paralyze a metropolitan area of 5,490,000 citizens ? what kind of whiteout does it take to halt every artery and interstate of this national traffic hub , this city that is home to a highway intersection known as " @entity206 " and to a college ( @entity205 ) and a former @entity208 player ( " @entity205 " @entity207 ) both named after @entity209 ? how much snow did it take to strand thousands of children overnight in their schools , send trucks and buses spinning out of control on surface streets and highways , decree that a baby should be born in a car trapped by traffic gridlock , and inspire gov. @entity222 to declare a statewide state of emergency and to call out the @entity224 ? it was 2.6 inches , ok ? or , as some news sources reported , " up to 3 inches , " a bit of forgivable inflation that would seem to suggest it might have been quantities up to and including 2.9 inches			1
nearly 3 ! but it does n't take depth of snow to ice the streets , and it does n't take a blizzard to panic the citizenry in a city without snowplows , snow shovels , windshield ice scrapers , or even , seemingly , a product known as " salt			0
" just a sprinkling of snow will do , a delicate frosting , a few curlicues from @entity246 -- and here we are , immobilized , freezing , turning in desperation to strangers and @entity111			0
opinion : stranded in @entity10 i was n't on the road tuesday			1
and i woke up to 46 - degree weather , not 16			1
but the 46 - degree weather was in my bedroom because our furnace died during the night			1
two weeks ago , when a deep freeze rolled across @entity10 , our pipes burst			1
we seem to be living in close synchrony with every national weather event			2
so while tens of thousands of our fellow citizens rumbled nowhere , i screened " how to @entity262 " videos on @entity264			0
inspired , i descended into the freezing basement and spent 15 minutes trying to remove the front of the furnace			0
then my husband unscrewed a protruding screw and it fell off			0
i peered deep into the machinery of the still and very cold machine and confirmed by phone that no repair person south of the @entity275 could travel the treacherous roads to our house			0
my husband , children , two dogs , two cats , and i huddled around electric space heaters all day			0
as i type , my feet are wrapped in a blanket and a space heater is warming a 4 - inch stretch on the side of my right leg			2
my teenage daughter has spent the day wrapped in an electric blanket on the sofa , with the dachshund wrapped inside it , too			0
but it could be worse			0
i could be on @entity209			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity297 .			0

@entity299 : @entity25 , @entity19 , traffic jam was nothing compared with @entity10 's
@entity303 : everybody tried to go home at once with the first snowflake in 16 - degree weather
@entity303 : " @entity70 " connected the stranded with help from those at home
@entity303 woke up to 46 - degree weather , but that was the *temperature* of her bedroom
