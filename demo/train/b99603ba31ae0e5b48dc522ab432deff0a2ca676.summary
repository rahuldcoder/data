-- @entity2 's name has been flung around the movie stratosphere with @entity5 - worthy momentum since his superhero blockbuster " @entity7 " staked a claim on the box office this summer			1
but the " @entity10 , " " @entity11 " and " @entity13 " creator still feels relatively nervous , modest , yenta - ish and excited when it comes to film festivals			1
his equally modest , black - and - white shakespeare adaptation " @entity17 " premieres saturday at this year 's @entity18			1
the festival runs from thursday through sept. 16			2
" i 've been to two festivals in my life , and i 've never been to @entity18			1
i have n't really been making festival movies			2
this is new territory for me , " @entity2 told @entity24			1
" i 'm kind of festive			2
@entity18 has an amazing rep. the entire cast is coming			1
that 's so exciting for me , since they 're all my buddies			2
i would like to find a distributor and would really like to see other people 's movies			0
" what 's next for @entity2 ? " @entity17 , " starring " @entity11 " alums @entity37 and @entity38 as sparring lovers @entity39 and @entity17 , and " @entity13 " alum @entity35 as comically incompetent constable @entity41 , is as far from " @entity7 ' " large sets and booming action as you can get			1
the movie was shot over 12 days at @entity2 's home in @entity47 , @entity48 it 's the first feature from @entity50 's mini studio @entity49 , which he created with his wife @entity53			1
@entity37 , who has flown somewhat under the radar since her role as wide - eyed @entity56 on " @entity11 , " did a reading of " @entity17 " with @entity58 years ago at @entity2 's house			1
hopefully the film version will land @entity37 back in the spotlight			2
" @entity37 's the best actress i 've ever worked with			0
get ready for an ace star performance			0
people were speechless , " gushed @entity2			1
" we started the home shakespeare readings 10 years ago or more			0
it was season five or season six of @entity10			0
@entity67 did not do the readings			0
a smattering of writers and actors from the shows did them			0
with @entity17 , eventually the technology changed to the point where you can make a movie , and not just a stage reading , but an actual production at home			1
" as for @entity35 , @entity2 said the @entity81 star had never read @entity82 , before filming the movie , and that @entity35 was scared			1
" but he was so assured , and so funny			0
people are thinking spinoff ! " said @entity2			1
@entity2 also mused about the connections between @entity82 and " @entity7 , " which has grossed more than $ 650 million domestically at the box office since its may debut , according to @entity88			1
apparently a knack for dry , snarky , intricate language and twisting , turning plot lines spans generations , tv , movies and plays			0
" there 's a reason @entity99 makes fun of @entity5 , and mentions @entity101 in @entity7 , " said @entity2			1
" it 's great to play high drama and comedy alongside a modern story			0
@entity82 was shameless about that stuff , pop culture references			2
much @entity108 is very much in the vein of the movies i make , which surprised me			0
it 's not that different from @entity7			2
it 's about finding why everyone is in the movie			0
what makes @entity118 the maid shine ? it was oddly similar			0
" as for making other independent films , with @entity2 's mega stuffed @entity123 schedule working on " @entity7 " sequel and tv spinoff " @entity125 , " will there still be time , or even room in his @entity123 contract , for the multitasking writer - director to feed into @entity49 ? @entity2 said yes			1
" the agreement with @entity123 carved out room for movies like ' @entity134 , ' which my wife produced , which we 've finished post on			0
and dr. horrible 2 , " said @entity2			2
" anything that is not movie and tv			0
i can do web , comic books , @entity144 © , art. " see full story at @entity24			0
