-- twenty years ago this month , @entity1 , @entity2 , the @entity3 and the @entity4 signed an agreement that represented a major step in global anti-proliferation efforts			1
under the deal , known as the @entity9 , @entity1 voluntarily surrendered the third largest nuclear arsenal in the world , which it had inherited after the collapse of the @entity13			1
but fast forward two decades , and an agreement once heralded as a breakthrough is gradually being undermined by one of the very countries that signed it			0
as part of the agreement , @entity1 willingly gave up more than 1,000 strategic and 2,500 tactical nuclear weapons , and agreed to the destruction of 176 silos used to launch intercontinental ballistic missiles			2
in return , @entity1 was offered security assurances by @entity2 , the @entity3 and the @entity4 in a document that highlighted the inviolability of @entity1 's existing borders and its sovereignty , called for the abstention from forceful actions that could threaten @entity1 's territorial integrity and prohibited economic pressure being placed on @entity1			1
unfortunately , @entity2 has disregarded each of these provisions			1
@entity2 aggression against @entity1 , first in @entity37 and soon after in eastern regions of @entity1 , has created an unprecedented challenge to international peace			1
indeed , rather than simply being a domestic or even regional crisis , what has been unfolding this year constitutes a violation of international law , undermining the existing checks and balances of the international system			0
for many years , the @entity9 served as a practical model for the implementation of the international nonproliferation regime			2
but recent violations of the agreement now risk undermining a system that safeguards states against national security threats through diplomatic means			0
as a result , many states may start to view the possession of weapons of mass destruction as the only effective means of safeguarding against external risks , in the process provoking a new arms race and ultimately increasing the threat of nuclear disaster down the road			0
none of this is to suggest that @entity1 is not grateful for the effort behind the memorandum ; other nations offered decisive support for our country 's independence			2
more recently , there has undoubtedly been practical assistance in our efforts at countering @entity2 aggression , and the @entity4 and @entity3 have both remained reliable and virtuous partners on the international stage			1
and yet , despite this assistance , it has become increasingly clear that the power of the @entity9 to guarantee our national security has taken a hit			2
it is that realization that has prompted @entity1 in recent months to push for closer integration with @entity91 , a cause that is popular both with the @entity1 people and which is also gaining political support			1
as president @entity99 noted last month , " it is clear that the non-bloc status of @entity1 proclaimed in 2010 could n't guarantee our security and territorial integrity			0
... this position has led to serious losses			0
that 's why we 've decided to return to the course of @entity91			0
" there is , of course , much work to be done if we are to reach the alliance 's compatibility standards , which is why the government has formulated a six - year plan for meeting membership requirements			0
but in the end , it seems only fitting that the status of @entity1 's relationship with @entity91 be left to the @entity1 people , and any decision in this regard will only be taken after consulting them in a form of referendum			1
more broadly , recent events in @entity1 have underscored the need for a rethink of the existing global security architecture			2
and while @entity2 aggression is clearly the catalyst , any changes should not be seen as simply directed at a single country , but as part of generally much - needed changes			1
it is imperative in our fast - changing world that states are granted new means of defending their territory , and that the most effective mechanisms are in place for preserving international peace			0
it 's a conversation that @entity1 , now more than ever , is keen to take part in .			0
