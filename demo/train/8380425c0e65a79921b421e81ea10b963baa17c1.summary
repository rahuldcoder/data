inspired by real - life butler @entity7 , @entity2 ( played by @entity8 ) witnesses the rise of the civil rights movement , the rev. @entity13 's assassination , @entity14 and the election of the @entity16 , all while simultaneously balancing the highs and lows of his family life			1
tracing the evolution of 20th century @entity3 society through the lens of one man 's life , this passion project from director @entity21 and screenwriter @entity22 drew @entity29 's top talent			1
along with @entity8 -- @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and more signed on to the film			1
the star - studded cast opened up to @entity0 about what it took to make one of summer 's most buzzed about movies , and revealed the behind - the - scenes secrets on the set of " the @entity46			2
" set secret no. 1 : @entity21 despises his name in the film 's title following an extensive battle with the @entity52 over the movie 's original title " @entity6 , " also the name of a 1916 short , @entity21 reluctantly agreed to differentiate his film by using the title " @entity6			1
" yet the director admits he does n't like seeing his name on the marquee , and says the title change broke his heart			1
" i do work for kids that are impoverished , that come from where i come from , which is the projects , and i do n't want them to feel that your name is more important than your work , " @entity21 said			1
" i do n't feel comfortable with it			2
i do n't feel like i 'm @entity70 , or @entity71			2
i 'm just a filmmaker trying to tell a story			0
" set secret no. 2 : @entity32 was up for the role of @entity2 @entity32 once eyed the role of leading man @entity2 , and even did a screen test for the part before @entity8 was cast as the butler			1
" but after watching the movie , " @entity32 said , " i could not picture anybody else other than @entity8			1
" set secret no. 3 : @entity35 avoided looking ' too pretty ' by removing a fake tooth @entity21 wanted to cast his pal @entity35 in " @entity6 , " but thought he was " too pretty " for the role of @entity2 ' feisty neighbor			1
that is , until @entity35 removed a fake tooth he 's had for 25 years to toughen up for the part			2
" @entity21 called me and he was like , ' @entity86 , i 'm having trouble			1
i want to put you in this movie , but i ca n't now			1
there 's this one character left but you 're too pretty for him			2
i do n't know what to do ! ' " @entity35 recalled			2
" and he 's like , ' can we cut your hair off or maybe give you an eye patch or a scar or something ? ' and i was like , ' you know what , i got a crown on this front tooth , you know , i can take that out			2
' he 's like , ' do n't you do it ! do n't you do it ! ... i 'll set up a dentist appointment right away ! ' " set secret no. 4 : @entity32 jumped into a pool sans swimsuit at a ' @entity46 ' kick - off party @entity21 says his lips are sealed about many of the behind - the - scenes moments on the set of " the @entity46			1
" yet he does indulge in one story about a raucous launch party			0
" @entity121 , @entity121 ... " @entity21 reminisced			1
" at our opening party for the cast , @entity30 was there and everybody was there , and @entity121 decided to jump into the pool naked			1
let 's just say that was the beginning of " the @entity46			2
" oh , " @entity6			1
" set secret no. 5 : @entity30 took @entity21 ' direction with a smile ... until he asked her to get into her underwear @entity21 said he felt very protective of @entity30 on the set , as she readily took his direction and allowed herself to become vulnerable			1
but the duo did clash once : when @entity21 asked the @entity138 to bare it all			1
" i had her in her bra and panties , " @entity21 said			1
" she was like ' no ! ' and i said ' oh , ok			0
' i would have fought her on it , but the only reason why i did n't is because it was a @entity144 movie			1
' " set secret no. 6 : @entity35 thinks he and @entity30 have chemistry @entity35 and @entity30 share a hot and heavy scene in " @entity6 , " and @entity35 brags they teamed up well on screen because they have chemistry in real life too			1
making out with @entity30 , he said , is " the greatest dream for any man			1
a guy can get the prom queen , but to get @entity157 or get @entity158 ? that 's the notch in the belt			2
" but really , he insists , " she was into me ! she had to approve me in that role			2
you 're not going to pick somebody to kiss and have a closeness like that with , that you do n't have a potential attraction for ! " set secret no. 7 : @entity36 faced incredible pressure to get his @entity171 accent right to prep for the enormous task of playing @entity173 , @entity36 kept podcasts of the president 's iconic speeches on his @entity177 , which he listened to as he went to sleep			1
the actor said getting the accent right was crucial in accurately portraying @entity173			0
" that was a really defining part of @entity183 : his accent , " @entity36 said			0
" it was n't necessarily @entity185 -- it was a little bit of @entity186 , it was all these things mixed in			2
it was the @entity173 accent			0
and i knew that was going to be the barometer by which you 're measured			0
and then beyond that you just hope to bring something else that you might not have ever seen -- capture sort of his essence , his intelligence , his charm			0
but i knew that all those other pieces would not have fallen into place if you did not have the accent			0
" set secret no. 8 : @entity202 nearly vomited after being spit on during a dinner sit - in scene when @entity202 played a black college student engaged in a sit - in at an all - white lunch counter , she was actually spit on by another actress during filming			2
@entity202 reveals she had an overwhelming reaction to the degradation			0
" the things that happen in the body when something like that happens in real life happened on set			0
you 're acting , it 's make believe , but the lines get blurry in scenes like that			0
especially when you 're using real saliva , " @entity202 said			0
" i actually had to jump up after cut , run out to the street and get some fresh air			0
i thought i was gon na vomit			0
i just gagged a bunch and washed my face probably four times			0
it took a while energetically to cleanse as well			0
but it was always great to remind ourselves as difficult as this was , it was nothing compared to the people that really sat at these lunch counters and endured this time and again , and again , and again			0
they could n't go back to their hotel rooms and just shake it off			0
" set secret no. 9 : @entity8 referenced high - profile news stories to play @entity2 @entity8 said he examined today 's racially charged cases , and internalized these stories , to get better into the mindset of his character			1
" i had to take this whole shape of history and make it a part of myself personally , " @entity8 said			1
" to be able to take these experiences we 're experiencing today ; what people are feeling about @entity259 or @entity260			0
these things are affecting people and they 're affecting their lives and their souls			0
we have to remember when you talk about ' @entity6 , ' we 're talking about the civil rights movement , which is continuing			2
it 's a living history , it 's not a dead history			0
" set secret no. 10 : the movie portrays a first in @entity29 history while " @entity6 " chronicles the evolution of the civil rights movement throughout the 20th century , it is also a story about family			1
with the film , screenwriter @entity22 strove to portray @entity3 - @entity3 families in a way that @entity29 has historically ignored			0
" we do n't ( usually ) see the black family in this situation ; intact and loving and talking , and being			0
we do n't see that on the screen , " @entity22 said			0
" i had a moment with @entity21 in the editing room ; we were watching the scene where they send @entity289 ( @entity31 ) away to college and he turned to me and said , ' never in the history of cinema has there been a scene of a black family sending their kid off to college			1
' he said , ' you should be really proud of yourself			0
' and i started to tear up			0
