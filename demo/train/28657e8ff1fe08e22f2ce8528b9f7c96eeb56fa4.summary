" after a fast - paced even start , @entity1 took control near the midway point of the first period , firing eight shots to two by the @entity3 over the next 12 minutes			1
the @entity1 maintained the advantage the rest of the way , using a smothering team defense to stifle the @entity3 after @entity49 's second - period goal			2
