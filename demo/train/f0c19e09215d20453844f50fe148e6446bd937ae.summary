-- as most parents of adolescents know all too well , text messaging has become the preferred method of communication for @entity8 teenagers , with one in three teens sending more than 100 texts a day , a new survey says			1
the survey by the @entity13 's @entity12 illustrates the indispensable role that text messaging , and mobile phones in general , play in the lives of today 's teenagers			1
three - quarters of 12 - to 17 - year - olds own cell phones , up from 45 percent in 2004 , and daily text messaging to friends has increased rapidly in recent years			1
the research , made public tuesday , confirms that teens make and receive far fewer phone calls than text messages			2
they primarily use their phones for voice calling when communicating with parents , although they prefer text messaging when it comes to communicating with their peers			2
although teens make or receive about five calls a day , half of them send a minimum of 50 text messages a day , the survey found			1
" texting is so functional and efficient , " said @entity38 , a senior research specialist at @entity13 , when asked to explain the survey results			2
" it 's convenient and fits into those small spaces in daily life			0
you 're not talking about much , but you 're telling people you 're connected to them			0
" how do teens manage to send so many text messages while spending the better part of monday through friday in the classroom ? forty - three percent of teens who take their phones to school reported sending at least one text message from class a day , despite the fact that many schools have banned cell phones in class			1
@entity38 said this just goes to show how important text messaging is to teens			0
" teenagers have been looking for ways to skirt around rules and defy administrators for millennia , whether it 's passing notes in class or passing digital notes in class through cell phones , " she said			1
and teenage girls are doing most of the texting			0
girls send and receive about 80 text messages a day , while boys send and receive only 30			1
this is not a surprising find , according to @entity13 , as females also use other communicative tools more than males			0
girls will text for social reasons more so than boys will , the survey found			1
for example , 59 percent of girls text their friends multiple times a day " just to say hello , " as opposed to 49 percent of boys who do the same			2
the fact that girls use their cell phones more than boys might be one reason that of the 64 percent of parents who have monitored their teens ' cell phones , the vast majority are parents of 12 - to 13 - year - old girls			1
" it 's a historic relationship			0
... parents tend to regulate girls more than boys for a variety of social and gender reasons , " @entity38 said			0
teens are using their phones to record and share their daily experiences , @entity38 said			0
in addition to texting , 83 percent of teens use their mobile phones to take pictures , and 64 percent of teens share their pictures with others			2
during focus groups , @entity38 said , she asked teens what they liked to take pictures of with their cell phones			2
the most common answers : their pets , the people in their lives and the funny things they want to share with their friends			0
@entity38 said the growth of wireless carriers ' unlimited texting plans has made it easier for teens to communicate via text message			1
" it 's like the all - you - can - eat plan , " she said			0
teenagers " do n't have to worry about cramming everything into 160 characters anymore			0
... it does n't cost 20 cents to send ' ok ' to a friend			0
