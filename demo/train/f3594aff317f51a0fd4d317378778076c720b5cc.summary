-- @entity1 has defended his preparation for this week 's @entity3 as he bids to win back - to - back majors without playing any competitive golf since his @entity7 triumph at @entity8			1
the 22 - year - old from @entity10 has drawn comparisons with @entity12 for the manner of his eight - shot triumph , but has not lifted a club in anger in the intervening three weeks			1
it has led his former @entity19 captain @entity18 to question the wisdom of the lack of match practice , but @entity1 was adamant tuesday that his approach worked for him			1
" i mean , i 've prepared the exact same way that i 've prepared for the last few major championships , and i feel it 's a process that works for me , " he told of the official @entity25 @entity7 website			1
" coming to the course the week before , getting a couple of practise rounds in , and then not really getting to the course until tuesday afternoon			0
" that works for me			0
i used to do it to sort of keep under the radar			0
i 'm not sure i 'll be able to do that anymore			0
but it works for me			0
caddying for the world number one " it might not work for other people , but i feel as if it 's the best way for me to approach a tournament			2
it seems to have worked the last few times , so i just need to keep doing that			0
" @entity1 has also had to cope with being catapulted into celebrity ranks , with a high - profile appearance at the wimbledon tennis championships plus a host of other media commitments			2
he admitted the reaction to his first major success had been something of a surprise			2
" i did n't realize how much of a fuss it would create or how much of a buzz , " said @entity1			2
" i 've already sort of noticed over the past three weeks it has been a bit of a life - changing experience , and it 's just something i 'm going to have to deal with			2
" @entity1 tees off at @entity62 's in the 140th edition of golf 's oldest major at 9.09 local time with @entity67 of @entity70 and fellow young gun @entity68 of the @entity71			1
he will be looking to match the spectacular 63 at last year 's @entity3 at @entity72 which gave him the first round lead , but not the second round 80 which ended his chances of victory			1
meanwhile , world number one @entity78 bids for back - to - back victories of his own after claiming the @entity80 at @entity81 at the weekend			1
@entity78 , who took over the mantle from fellow @entity84 @entity83 , admitted he was in the form of his life			1
" this is probably the best i have ever played , " he said as he reflected on a stellar 2011 which has seen him claim three victories and a clutch of top - 10 finishes			0
it was kickstarted by his victory at the @entity95 tournament in @entity96			0
" as soon as you get that one win , it kind of opened up the door , gave me a lot of confidence , and i 've been playing very well since then , " he added .			0
