@entity0 , @entity1 -- it was a confident and forthright address by the new @entity1 president			1
with his wife , @entity7 , and one of his four children looking on -- as well as @entity11 vice president @entity10 -- @entity12 set a new course for @entity1 , one that was unabashedly @entity15			1
but he also had a warning for anyone who threatened his country : " any aggressor at the border of @entity1 must recall the evangelical wisdom : @entity22 who comes with the sword will fall from the sword			1
" in an address to @entity26 that lasted nearly 30 minutes , @entity12 , 48 , frequently returned to the theme of peace , security and independence for @entity1 , and vowed to preserve the territorial integrity of the country			1
that integrity has come under threat in the last two months by what amounts to a rebellion in the eastern regions of @entity38 and @entity0 , one that 's led by groups of @entity42 separatists who have declared " people 's republics " in both areas			2
the speech appeared intended both to rally his supporters , with parliamentary elections imminent , and offer an olive branch to opponents			0
@entity12 said he was ready to talk to @entity1 of all viewpoints , and directed remarks in @entity54 to the 6 million people living in the eastern @entity57 region			1
he promised recognition of minority rights and the @entity54 language , and support for previously announced decentralization reform , which was one of the earlier demands of protestors in the @entity65			0
but there would be a limit , he suggested			0
" new powers will be granted to local governments , but @entity1 was , is , and will be a unitary state , " he said			2
the new president struck a resolute note in dealing with armed groups in the @entity65			0
he promised amnesty for anyone who puts down their arms but repeated he would not negotiate with anyone who had blood on their hands -- people he described as " gangsters and killers			0
" he accused former president @entity85 -- who fled @entity86 in february -- of financing terrorism in the @entity65 , which had been brought to the brink of disaster			0
@entity54 who had crossed the border with weapons would be granted safe passage home			0
the message to @entity54 and to president @entity94 , whom @entity12 met on the sidelines of the @entity97 commemorations in @entity98 on friday , was twofold			1
@entity1 could never be reconciled to the annexation of @entity101 " which is and always will be part of @entity1 , " he said , drawing a standing ovation from parliamentarians			2
but at the same time , he acknowledged that " citizens of @entity1 will never enjoy the beauty of peace unless we settle down our relations with @entity54			2
" @entity12 had said friday that he hoped negotiations would begin with @entity54 as early as sunday to defuse the confrontation in the @entity65			2
@entity94 responded that the @entity1 government should really be talking with its own people			2
how those relations can be settled while @entity1 steams ahead toward integration with @entity15 will be @entity12 's greatest challenge			1
but of his ultimate vision for the country , he left no doubt			0
the association agreement and visa - free travel for @entity1 to the @entity122 were but the first steps " towards fully - fledged membership of @entity1 in the @entity122			1
" again , there was prolonged applause from his audience			0
whether the @entity122 is prepared for the cost and political risk involved in accepting @entity1 as its 28th member is very much open to doubt			1
but as an entrepreneur -- a billionaire who has made his fortune in the candy business -- @entity12 made clear that he believed only massive investment and a sustained war against corruption could create a " modern , high - tech and defensible " @entity1 -- a plan that could only be accelerated by looking to @entity15			1
he also promised a special program of investment aimed at eastern @entity1 , which suffers from high unemployment , a declining coal industry and decrepit manufacturing plants			0
but the immediate response from the self - declared leaders of the eastern regions was dismissive			0
a spokesman for @entity148 , prime minister of the @entity149 , told @entity2 that there would only be negotiations with @entity12 's government when the @entity1 military left the region , a demand already expressed by his counterpart in @entity0 , @entity157			1
@entity12 later went to @entity158 in @entity86 to receive a multi-confessional blessing			0
at a military ceremony outside the cathedral , he seemed briefly overcome by the occasion -- and perhaps the weight of office -- with tears in his eyes			0
@entity1 's president vows to defend territory ' no matter what ' @entity170 vows to stand with @entity1 as he meets @entity171 in @entity172			1

@entity1 's new president sets course toward @entity122
@entity12 made his fortune as the *chocolate* king
he talked tough on separatists in his inaugural address
