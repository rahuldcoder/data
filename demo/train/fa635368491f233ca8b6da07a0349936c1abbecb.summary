" i am standing tall for my sons			1
" on sunday , authorities said @entity14 met a foster - care worker who had brought his two boys -- ages 5 and 7 , having both celebrated birthdays in january -- to their father 's residence for what was supposed to be a supervised visit			1
as the children got close to the door , @entity14 brought them inside but prevented the case worker from getting in as well , according to @entity11			1

@entity11 said the sheriff 's department has copies of a brief e-mail that had gone out to @entity14 's family and friends , " stating that he could n't live with what was going on			1
" authorities have n't confirmed the message came from @entity14 , but " we have no reason to believe it was not from him , " he said			1
" it shows that there was intent , and this was what he intended to do -- which is to kill his children and kill himself , " @entity11 said of the e-mail			0
in the affidavit seeking custody of his children from his wife 's parents that was filed last week , @entity14 claimed that his sons " sustained severe injuries in the care of their grandparents , " adding that , " for the sake of my sons , we can all do better			1
" " if anyone wants to be honest with themselves and the situation , the real story is not that anyone is a bad person , including me , " he said			0
" the story is one of overcoming and rising above what many people think are insurmountable challenges			0
" the @entity4 court denied the motion from @entity14 to gain custody , said @entity151 , a @entity4 lawyer who was representing @entity14			2
@entity11 said a judge also ordered @entity14 to " go through different types of evaluations and counseling , " though supervised visits could continue			2
