-- i 'm writing this from a @entity3 in northern @entity4 the day after @entity5 blasted through , wiping out power to millions of homes , including my own			1
my 13 year - old daughter sits across from me , doing her homework on her laptop			0
i 'm very grateful that @entity3 ' is open and has some outlets in the wall and a decent wireless connection -- though for some reason , they do n't have any donuts			2
so , maybe i 'm not in a great place , but i 'm lucky			0
for many families , the storm brought real tragedy , in some cases loss of life and livelihood			1
not only is there flooding , with communities devastated , but homes , businesses , and cars have been damaged or lost ; for many there are days of missed work -- and missed paychecks			1
@entity32 on tuesday morning , with cars strewn about , looked like a scene from " @entity35			0
" politics : disaster relief -- @entity38 , @entity39 differ on federal role i 've seen rough loss estimates of up to $ 20 billion , of which perhaps half will be replaced by insurance payouts			1
the realization of how quickly such a natural event can occur should lead us to consider what all this means in terms of responding to this much devastation			0
when states face disasters of this proportion , one of the first places they turn for help is the federal government , specifically the @entity58			1
politics : will you be able to vote on @entity61 ? this is as it should be			0
in fact , it 's a great example of why we need a centralized federal government that can respond to states in their time of need			1
kind of like an instant recession , a natural disaster is an unexpected event that causes great disruption to the lives of its victims and their communities that is often well beyond the capacity of states to reliably bear			2
we should of course expect states , as well as private citizens , to respond , and @entity85 have consistently risen to such moments , showing our deep generosity			0
it 's times like this that " there but for the grace of @entity94 ... " kicks in for many of us			0
but neither we as individuals nor our cities or states can do it all ourselves			0
imagine , as @entity39 has advocated ( though not on tuesday , apparently ) , that @entity58 were eliminated , privatized , or handed off to states in a block grant			1
or consider the @entity104 @entity103 budget -- authored by rep. @entity105 and endorsed by @entity39 during the primaries -- a proposal that would cut 22 % from the part of the budget that supports this type of aid to the states , amounting to a loss of $ 28 billion in 2014 , including a $ 2 billion cut in @entity115 alone			1
further imagine -- and if you 've been following the hundreds of thousands of state layoffs of key personnel in recent months , this should n't be a stretch -- that a disaster like @entity5 occurred at a time when state budgets are already under great strain ( as are many families ' budgets )			2
remember , a block grant is a fixed amount that by definition is unable to expand in times of need			0
in many ways , it 's a fair - weather ship that does fine in calm waters but founders in a storm			0
@entity138 ( work - based assistance for poor families with kids ) , for example , was block granted in the mid- 1990s , and it worked adequately when the economy was humming			2
but when the recession hit , it failed as a safety net , especially compared with federal programs like food assistance or unemployment insurance that handily expanded to meet the recession - induced need			0
opinion : @entity5 debunks ' nanny state ' it 's unimaginable that we could administer federal disaster relief this way			1
states like @entity115 and @entity158 would unquestionably need more help in a storm like @entity5 , yet we 'd have to tell their governors : " hey , we 'd love to help , but if your block grant does n't cover it , there 's nothing we can do about it			1
" that 's obviously ludicrous , and it 's also why you 'll see avowed partisans like @entity158 gov. @entity171 , a @entity103 , showing real decency as he stressed tuesday how helpful the president has been and how important the federal response is in addressing @entity5 's impact in his state			2
i hope the storm is a good reminder that when we hear candidates ' soothing words about shedding federal government functions , whether it 's @entity58 , @entity183 , or safety nets in recession , we must think about what that actually means in practice			1
disasters happen , recessions happen -- like it or not , there are market failures and natural disasters in our future			0
if anything , it seems as though these 100 - year storms come about every six months these days			0
( which reminds me -- here 's a great idea for a big , national infrastructure project that will create millions of jobs for white - and blue - collar workers and save billions in lost output : @entity207 the power lines ! ) at the end of the day , we do n't need " big " government or " small " government			2
what we need is an amply funded federal government to meet challenges like those we 're facing today , something i 'm afraid @entity39 and @entity105 do not understand			1
opinion : do n't let superstorm sway your vote the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity223 .			2

@entity223 says @entity5 brought loss of life , devastation to homes , businesses , lives
he says *over-burdened* states *rightly* turn to federal government for help from @entity58
he says @entity39 , @entity105 have proposed block grants for states instead , or privatizing relief
writer : disasters can *outstrip* block grants ; states *strapped* . in practice , these ideas wo n't work
