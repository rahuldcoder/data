-- president @entity2 's response to the @entity4 insurgency , including his recently declared state of emergency in three northern @entity7 states , is eerily reminiscent of previous approaches to sectarian violence in that region			1
the @entity12 uprising of 1980 is perhaps the single most important precedent - setting example			2
in december 1980 , the confrontation between the @entity18 @entity17 sect -- which advocated purity in the practice of @entity17 -- and the people of @entity22 came to a head			2
the @entity7 army and air force mounted a campaign against the sect			2
in the end , more than 4,000 people were dead with double this number injured alongside massive destruction of property			2
@entity35 's population has doubled since the @entity12 uprising			1
@entity35 continues to experience the " youth bulge " -- a growing youth population -- that was not planned for			1
the resulting pressure on socio - economic systems is evident in limited education and health and dwindling economic opportunities for young people			2
poor policies and bad planning have produced youth vulnerability and exclusion from mainstream life			0
this is doubly so in northern @entity35 , where class divides have further created a community of people with nothing to lose			1
read this : @entity7 ask , are we at war ? the global environment has also changed amid growing transnational threats			0
@entity61 continues to lurk in the neighborhood			0
excluded groups in the region with affinity for @entity4 are potential support networks amid an ever - rising flow of illicit weapons into the region			1
one thing has hardly changed : elite behavior			0
@entity35 's power elite remains far removed from the realities of life experienced by ordinary citizens			1
the ruling elite 's framing of the @entity4 challenge lends itself easily to just one set of responses -- the use of force to rout @entity4 , although more recently the federal government of @entity35 proposed an amnesty for @entity4			1
to be certain , a military approach is only part of the solution			0
it is by no means a panacea			0
this military campaign , coupled with amnesty , rings hollow			0
it does not offer much hope for dealing comprehensively with the underlying causes of the @entity4 phenomenon			1
it is no wonder @entity4 has treated the offer of amnesty by the @entity2 - led government with disdain			1
for one , it may be worth holding out for a greater prize , knowing that it probably has this regime by the jugular			0
besides , how could it trust that the offer of amnesty -- which will unveil @entity4 -- is not a ploy by the regime to round them up and execute them ? the allegedly extra-judicial killing of the sect 's late leader , @entity109 , serves as a constant warning			1
watch this : who are @entity4 ? perhaps more importantly , this military solution and current state of emergency is potentially damaging for the military			1
the @entity7 military only recently managed to repair its image , winning accolades abroad for its peacekeeping role			0
asking it to employ maximum force in internal operations -- causing casualties in the process among the very people it is meant to protect -- has repercussions			0
surely , this will diminish its stature abroad and reduce citizens ' confidence in the military at home , while drawing more support to @entity4 and weakening troops ' morale			1
that said , it is also the case that @entity7 far removed from the locus of the crisis may not see the military 's role in such negative terms			0
this crisis will potentially deepen religious and regional cleavages			0
perhaps the country 's saving grace is that for the time being , @entity35 's youth population mostly buys into these divides			1
they do not yet have a common narrative about who their " real enemy " is			0
barring a small number of states , where genuine effort is being made to confront serious governance deficits , the picture of elite marginalization and widening inequality is consistent countrywide			0
@entity4 commands the loyalty of the excluded at several levels			1
at this moment , @entity4 is obviously asserting influence , and that assertion of influence is accepted by a significant number of people who see no change in their primary condition			1
this factor partly attracted large crowds to the preaching of @entity4 's late leader , @entity109			1
his narratives about the ills of @entity181 education were enriched by evident gaps in governance			0
the breakdown of the education system , growing youth unemployment and insecurity amid rampant corruption swelled the ranks of @entity4			1
when the sense of " nothing to lose " is mixed with these strong narratives , the issue is not whether or not they are true but that there are no strong counter-narratives or genuine counter actions			0
a lasting solution to the crisis in northern @entity35 might lie in a missing trinity : a meaningful but powerful narrative to counter @entity4 's narrative ; an action plan akin to a " @entity203 " for northern @entity35 ; and isolation of what @entity2 has described as @entity4 sympathizers in the government and security forces			1
developing a powerful counter narrative will demand a measure of sincerity and consistency among the country 's ruling elite			0
such a narrative must stand up to the seeming lure of @entity4 and have the ability to hold a young population captive for the foreseeable future			1
an action plan akin to a @entity203 for northern @entity35 must be developed to suit the context			1
the federal government 's investment in regeneration of northern @entity35 , with a focus on youth sensitization , education and development of social and economic entrepreneurship , will be key			2
this might entail deliberate forms of youth cantonment , census - based planning , community - based programs , and innovative education schemes to kick start regeneration			0
to be sure , an action plan for northern @entity35 will not be sustainable in an environment where youth exclusion is a countrywide problem even if it is more chronic in the north			2
expressed intention to do this nationally in due course might persuade a captive youth audience			0
the question remains as to whether alleged @entity4 sympathizers among the elite can be dislodged from this process			2
this might be the single most important obstacle in a situation where retaining political power in 2015 seems more valuable to the regime than the welfare of a few million disposable citizens			0
in the immediate term , we can expect the @entity7 military to record successes against the @entity4 sect			2
but the victory will be hollow			0
without the trinity of measures earlier described , @entity2 's government risks sacrificing the ordinary people of northern @entity35 , the military 's reputation , and innocent bloodshed			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of ' @entity272 .			2

response to @entity4 insurgency has echoes of the past , says ' @entity272
she says @entity4 commands loyalty of the excluded
@entity35 needs a " @entity203 , " she argues
