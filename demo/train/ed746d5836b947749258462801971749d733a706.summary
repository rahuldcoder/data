-- @entity1 hosted the @entity2 and @entity3 and @entity4 this week , marking the first visit of a @entity6 to @entity7 in 28 years			1
the @entity9 nation has positioned itself as an attractive destination for @entity12 investment over the last decade , with a number of big projects in the pipeline			0
one of them is the @entity12 - funded @entity19 - @entity18 bridge over the @entity21 river which was ceremonially opened by @entity12 premier @entity22 and @entity1 prime minister @entity23 thursday			1
@entity1 is increasingly looking to invest in big infrastructure projects in @entity25 in order to ease the passage of its goods from the @entity30 port of @entity31 , which is under a 35 - year concession by @entity12 shipping giant @entity33 , to western @entity4			1
@entity0 's @entity34 sat down with @entity23 in @entity7 ahead of the summit to discuss the government 's efforts against corruption , @entity1 's strategy for @entity41 membership and the @entity43 issue			1
an edited version of the interview follows			0
@entity0 : strategically , why is it so important at this point in time to be having this summit and to invite so many different countries ? @entity23 : it is actually the third summit in a row that is taking place here in @entity7 and we are very satisfied because of that fact			1
i 'm really jubilant to see 16 prime ministers in our country , in @entity7			2
it means that @entity7 once again became a very open , connected city			0
many people from all over the world would associate @entity1 with some past times , with the wars , and some terrible times not only for @entity1 but for the whole region			1
i dare to say today that @entity1 is renewing its energy , @entity1 is once again a very open society and a very open place for all our guests			1
@entity0 : what is @entity12 getting out of it ? some wonder if they will have undue influence in this country , because of the strong economic ties ? @entity79 : they get our money			1
it 's capitalism ; they invest something , they earn money and that 's it -- it 's a market economy			0
@entity0 : you 're all in competition , i would say , in these @entity94 countries for that @entity12 investment			2
do you think there 's enough around to go for everyone , or do you feel that it is a competitive environment right now ? @entity79 : we do our best			0
of course there is competition , that 's something very normal between countries and @entity1 is not afraid of competition			1
from @entity1 you have a very open market of one billion people , which means that we have free trade agreements with the @entity41 , and on the other hand we have free trade agreements with @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 , as well as @entity113			2
we also have a very good relationship with many @entity116 countries , including @entity12 and @entity117 , and i think we still have many ties in the non-alignment movement			0
as former @entity121 , we were founders of the non-alignment movement and i think that many investors should come to @entity1 to use our unique position			2
also , we have very competitive labor costs , very high - skilled labor , and very educated and knowledgeable people			0
@entity0 : one of those important reforms is your anti-corruption pledge			2
what is the situation now ? @entity79 : there is no problem with political will			0
there are no protected persons , there are no protected tycoons , protected politicians			0
the problem is that we still have an old system where people can work on each case for years , not to say for decades ... and that 's something that will have to change			0
@entity0 : turning to @entity41 membership , is 2020 the year that you 'll be able to fulfill all of @entity1 's requirements to gain membership ? @entity79 : if you ask me whether i do hope for my country to become a new member state , yes i do			1
but it 's not something that i would like to promise to my people to gain some more political points and then not to deliver			0
what we can promise to our people is our deliverance -- to finish all the needed reforms to create a sustainable and great business environment in this country , a very good investment climate ... that will have a growth rate in 2016 and 2017 that we will be able to boast with			0
@entity0 : i want to ask you , will you categorically recognize @entity43 without any caveats , if that 's the condition for @entity41 membership ? @entity79 : i 've never heard of that condition			1
to say you have to recognize @entity43 as an independent state ... would be the kind of condition that would be saying or conveying a message to @entity1 , " ok , we do not expect you in the @entity41 very soon			2
