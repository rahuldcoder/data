@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 said wednesday that it had put a satellite in orbit for the first time , giving a lift to its homegrown space industry and matching a feat achieved last month by its hostile neighbor , @entity10			1
amid a billowing plume of smoke , the @entity12 rocket blasted off from a launch site perched on the edge of an island near the country 's southern coast			0
@entity1 television footage showed it ascending into the clear blue sky			0
@entity1 officials : @entity10 rocket could hit @entity25 mainland officials and technicians watched the launch intently to see if it would succeed in delivering its payload into orbit			1
a crowd of onlookers near the site applauded and waved national flags			0
about an hour after takeoff , science minister @entity37 declared the launch a success			0
@entity10 on @entity41 : monuments , nuclear complex , gulags the pressure on the @entity1 rocket scientists to get the satellite into space increased after @entity10 carried out its own successful launch last month in defiance of @entity52 resolutions			1
only weeks before that , the @entity1 was forced to suspend its previous attempt to launch the @entity12 rocket after finding problems with the electronic signal just minutes before it was due to take off			1
the country 's previous launch attempts in 2009 and 2010 had failed			1
after threats against @entity25 , @entity10 turns ire to @entity1 wednesday 's successful effort comes at a delicate time on the @entity63 : @entity10 said last week that it plans to conduct a new nuclear test and carry out more rocket launches after the @entity52 voted to tighten sanctions on the secretive regime			1
@entity68 did n't say when it intends to carry out the nuclear test , which follows previous underground detonations in 2006 and 2009			0
although the @entity10 's rocket launch last month managed to put an object in space , it was widely considered to be a test of long - range ballistic missile technology			1
it 's unclear whether that satellite is functional			0
@entity10 says new nuclear test will be part of fight against @entity25 saber - rattling statements in its saber - rattling statements last month , @entity10 said its missile and nuclear programs were part of a new phase of confrontation with the @entity25			0

@entity1 authorities say their latest attempted satellite launch is a crucial step for the development of the country 's civilian space program			1
the satellite carried by the launch vehicle is mainly intended for gathering climate data and other atmospheric information , they say			0
is @entity102 on cusp of space race ? analysts have said the @entity1 launch is different from that of the @entity10 because it is more transparent , clearly focused on civilian applications and does n't contravene @entity52 sanctions			1
the development of the @entity1 rocket program , using @entity113 technology for the first - stage launcher , began in 2002			2
@entity0 is aiming to develop its own thruster by 2021 through a program estimated to cost 1.5 trillion won ( about $ 1.4 billion )			2
the successful launch puts @entity1 among the small group of nations that have sent a rocket into space from their own soil			2
others include the @entity25 , @entity113 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity10			0
@entity1 already has a number of satellites in space , but they were launched in other countries using foreign rocket technology			2
opinion : rescind @entity10 's license to provoke @entity2 's @entity138 reported from @entity0 , and @entity139 reported and wrote from @entity140 .			2

new : @entity1 was forced to suspend its previous attempt weeks earlier
other launch attempts in 2009 and 2010 had failed
@entity10 successfully launched its own rocket last month , *defying* @entity52 resolutions
@entity0 says it is trying to develop its own civilian space program
