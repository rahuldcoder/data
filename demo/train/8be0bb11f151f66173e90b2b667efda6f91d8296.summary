@entity0 -- from movie stars and business moguls to politicians and pop stars , the @entity3 press has never shied away from picturing famous figures in compromising positions			2
until now , that is			0
@entity15 , grainy shots of celebrities flashing their birthday suits or falling out of skimpy outfits were the stock - in trade of titles like @entity19 and the @entity20			0
and the royal family was by no means immune : prince @entity22 , prince @entity23 and the @entity24 , @entity24 , have all been caught up in tabloid scandals -- with or without embarrassing photos to accompany them -- in the past			0
but offered the chance to splash images of prince @entity30 cavorting in the nude with a naked woman during a trip to @entity34 across their front pages this week , the @entity3 's papers have hesitated , apparently genuinely puzzled as to whether to " publish and be damned			1
" so what has changed ? the @entity3 media landscape has altered beyond recognition since the death of @entity30 's mother , princess @entity42 , killed in a car crash as she fled a crowd of photographers in @entity46 15 years ago			1
the shock of that accident provoked an immediate backlash against both the paparazzi , and the tabloids that bought their pictures			0
but its impact was not a lasting one : within months , the papers were back to their old tricks , and the punters were happy to pay for them			0
photos of naked @entity30 published the real watershed has come in the last 18 months , with the discovery of the full scale of the phone - hacking scandal ( initially revealed by the hacking of prince @entity65 and prince @entity30 's mobile phones ) , which forced the closure of the @entity69 , and prompted the @entity70 into press standards			1
following months of evidence detailing the dirty tricks and devastation wrought by some members of the gutter press , @entity72 is currently deciding whether to recommend new rules and regulations , governing the conduct of the @entity3 media			1
until his report is ready , analysts believe , editors simply do n't want to upset the applecart			0
@entity88 columnist @entity86 wrote in her blog that newspapers have been " painted into a corner , with one eye on their budgets which mean they need to avoid unnecessary court costs , and another on the line they do n't want to cross before that report is written , just in case they make things any worse			0
" @entity102 , former deputy editor of @entity19 and the now - defunct @entity69 , tweeted that the pictures were the " perfect example of how # @entity72 has cowed our media ... rest of world discussing pix no - one dares show you here			1
" in a blog for the @entity111 , @entity102 said the dilemma over whether to use the prince @entity30 photographs was " nothing to do with journalistic merit , nothing to do with the merits of the story , nothing to do with legal issues , nothing even to do with journalistic ethics ... " the decisions are being reached on the basis of : ' what will @entity72 think ? ' and that is shocking , it is outrageous , it is a disgraceful affront to free speech			0
" political blogger @entity127 -- whose site was one of the few in the @entity3 to run the pictures in defiance of requests from the palace -- wrote that " the old media have been scared into submission by the @entity70			1
" much of the debate over whether to run the pictures or not centers on the question of privacy : despite his very public role , prince @entity30 was on a private visit to the @entity142 , and the photographs were taken in his hotel suite			1
pending any changes in the wake of the @entity70 , @entity3 newspaper editors are bound by the @entity149 's @entity148 , which insists that " everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private and family life , " and that " it is unacceptable to photograph individuals in private places without their consent			1
" there is a get - out clause , in the shape of exceptions for cases " in the public interest			0
" in the past , the fact that the prince was supposed to be being watched over by a very large and very expensive security team at the time the pictures were taken would certainly have been enough to ensure their publication			0
royal correspondent @entity168 said that team of minders had questions to answer : " why did n't royal bodyguards ask anyone going into @entity30 's suite to handover their phones for security , " he tweeted			2
" would prevent all this			0
" but long - time royal expert @entity179 said both @entity30 and his entourage should have known they could not expect what went on in @entity34 to stay in @entity34			2
" privacy when you 're prince @entity30 and globe - trotting does n't exist , " he tweeted			2
" it was a private trip but he 's a loose canon [ sic ] and should n't be left alone			0
" embarrassing pics could harm a soldier 's career several ways some commentators also suggest part of the reason for the @entity3 media 's hesitation is the fact that , in the wake of a series of good news stories including the @entity203 , the royals ' stock is higher now than it has been in decades			1
writing in the @entity205 , @entity204 claimed the papers were refusing to use the pictures not out of " fear of regulators but fear of their own readers , " adding that @entity30 and his kin " are celebrities , like others , but untouchable ones			1
" and @entity217 , former features editor of the @entity69 , said @entity30 's popularity -- which endures largely because of his @entity220 image , not in spite of it -- means he is unlikely to suffer any lasting damage from the incident			2
" public love @entity30 & we should n't forget his bravery in serving , " @entity217 tweeted			0
we 'll forgive him cos we like him & he puts his life on line for us ( albeit in [ a ] protected way )			0
" whether or not the @entity3 tabloids decide to publish the photos in their print editions , the fact remains that they are freely available -- anyone who wants to see them simply needs to search the internet			1
the old rules no longer apply , and how @entity3 's " old media " deal with this challenge may set the tone for a long time to come			1
a tale of two brothers as journalist and royal watcher @entity247 tweeted : " the whole world will be seeing - and laughing at these pictures - so will @entity3 papers run them ? this is a massive watershed moment , both for the royals and the @entity3 press post phone hacking scandal			1
" it seems the front covers of thursday 's papers may show the direction that @entity88 is heading in -- even if they do n't reveal the bare buttocks of a @entity3 royal			2
