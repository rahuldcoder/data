-- from the responses to our story thursday on how tablets are paving a rough road for the future of dedicated e-readers , one thing was clear : we still love our e ink			1
hundreds weighed in with comments , and the overwhelming majority argued that while tablets offer a range of nifty features , they still have n't caught up with @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 or @entity19 for curling up with a good e-book			1
many folks said they 've found a spot in their digital lives for both types of devices			1
" i have a tablet and an e-reader			1
they both have their place , " wrote a commenter called @entity30			1
" i would n't give up my e-reader because for one , the battery life is amazing			1
and two , its e-ink makes it almost look like paper			0
" ( @entity9 is a proprietary type of electronic paper that 's found in most e-readers			1
) seventy - six of you voted up the comment			0
@entity30 's clearly onto something			0
" my kobo is so small and light that i can hold it and click on it to turn the page with one hand , " wrote the ominously monikered @entity44			0
" and the battery lasts about 1 week even if i use it a lot			0
for reading a book , e-ink is best , for web browsing and video , a bigger tablet is much better			1
trying to make one device for everything leads to a device that does nothing well			0
" experts quoted in our report painted a rosier picture for tablets			1
while the devices have n't yet matched the easy - on - the - eyes look of @entity9 , most of the new ones have high - definition screens , and it may only be a matter of time before they catch up			1
for now , it 's the glare from a tablet 's screen that 's keeping some folks from spending hours on the devices , streaming @entity79 and looking up definitions of big words while wading through , say , the bloody " @entity83 " book series			2
" do n't forget that some of us are light sensitive			2
if i sat down for a long reading session on a tablet , i would get a headache , " commenter @entity86 said			2
" for this reason , my e-reader is great			2
i really do fear that tablets will kill off both paper and e-ink and will diminish the pleasantness of the reading experience			1
" still , some folks agreed with what the analysts quoted in the report were saying			2
" i can go to any of a dozen sites and order a cheap tablet from @entity105 for $ 50 to $ 75 ( including delivery ) that does everything a reader does plus hundreds of things a reader ca n't do , " wrote @entity102			2
" so why waste money on a inferior product just because of the brand name ? " added lasertekk , " it 's only a matter of time before an e-ink screen gets combined with a lcd , giving you both devices in one package			2
" and some of the biggest fans of the readers noted that , in a way , they 're victims of their own success			0
@entity130 : " @entity132 thing about an e-reader is you do n't have to get the latest and greatest one every six months			1
" and @entity134 : " i agree			0
the real problem with e-readers is that they last ( nearly ) forever , that people do n't need to replace or upgrade every few years or so			0
i still have the kindle with the keyboard , and it still works great			0
" so is there much hope for e-reader fans ' beloved devices ? some of you seem to think so			1
writing with the screen name guiwhiz , one commenter echoed a scenario voiced by analyst @entity149			0
this is where they are going to be relevant , " he wrote			0
" giving young teenage children tablets is a big investment not just in hardware , but in all kinds of other costs / headaches as well			0
give a kid an e-reader with the textbooks pre-loaded , the ' limited browser ' locked down to the school websites / proxy server and then you have a potential replacement for textbooks			0
" just my two cents of course , but boy that is where i would be focusing my ( research and development ) money if i was @entity17			1
" that , and several suggestions about improving web browsing and other features , might keep tablets from killing electronic readers			1
" maybe not kill , " wrote @entity181			0
" but put on life support maybe			0

report on how tablets are hurting the e-reader *market* got @entity0 readers talking
tablets are booming , but many *remain* loyal to @entity17 , kindles and the like
tablets still have n't caught up for a pure reading experience , some commenters say
many have found a place in their digital arsenal for both devices
