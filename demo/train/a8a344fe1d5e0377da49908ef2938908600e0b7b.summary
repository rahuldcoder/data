-- ever since " bridge-gate " threatened to derail the once " inevitable " nomination of @entity4 gov. @entity3 as the @entity6 presidential candidate for 2016 , @entity1 has been hinting that he might jump into the fray			1
and with last week 's @entity11 announcement , the former @entity9 governor has emerged as a serious contender -- if he chooses to run			0
the announcement of an exploratory committee has generated instant excitement because many republicans feel that the former governor stands a very real chance of winning both the @entity6 nomination and the general election			1
though the pundits have pored over all of his liabilities , most importantly the damage that his older brother inflicted on the family name , @entity1 brings a lot to the table for 2016			1
if he handles this process the right way , @entity1 has the opportunity to put together a strong campaign			1
democrats and his @entity6 opponents should be worried			1
the most important asset @entity1 offers is that he is a known commodity , someone who is greatly respected in @entity6 circles			1
in this day and age of freewheeling primaries , the comfort level that experience and familiarity provides to potential donors and voters means a lot			0
@entity6 are desperate to win back the @entity42 after eight years of @entity31 rule			1
their recent success in the midterms whet their appetite for gaining control over the government			0
@entity6 know that the electoral math will be extremely difficult for them in 2016 as more voters , particularly among @entity31 , are likely to come to the polls and the electoral college map favors blue			1
@entity6 have watched many of their candidates crash and burn in recent primaries , so they are eager to find someone who make it through to the finish line for the nomination and present a strong case in the general election			1
@entity1 can survive the pressure from the right in the primaries			2
all the speculation as to whether someone like him will be done in by the @entity69 in primaries is vastly overblown			0
most importantly , other than on immigration reform and education policy , @entity1 is a conservative and has a record to prove it			1
as @entity75 of the @entity76 recounted , moderate is not really a label that fits his record			0
he has a rather conservative record on tax cuts and gun rights , one that would be quite appealing to the right			2
he is a staunch opponent of abortion rights and same - sex marriage			0
much " of his record in @entity9 is that of the ' headbanging conservative ' he claimed to be during a first , unsuccessful campaign for governor in 1994 , " @entity87 writes			0
he attacked affirmative action and gained national prominence when he fought against @entity92 who wanted to remove the feeding tube of his wife @entity92			0
with @entity96 , he stuck to the traditional hardline position in response to president @entity100 's recent announcements on normalizing relations			0
@entity1 will be able to make a strong case in the primaries that he is as conservative as anyone else in the bunch			1
and even if there are still questions about his conservative credentials in the age of the @entity69 , the power of the right in the @entity6 primaries has not really proven to be debilitating to candidates who are trying to build a broad coalition			1
in 2008 @entity6 picked @entity116 sen. @entity115 who famously had been in conflict with the right wing of his party			1
@entity123 gov. @entity122 , despite all the predictions that he would never survive , did just fine on his way to the 2012 nomination			0
these candidates were able to make enough statements to please conservatives without radically transforming who they were			0
this year will be no different			0
most @entity6 activists are thirsty for a candidate who can win rather than one who would be 100 % pure on ideological issues			1
then there is the power of money			0
during the recent midterm primaries , the @entity6 establishment showed that money matters			2
in 2014 , tea party candidates fared very poorly when confronted with republicans who had the backing of big money conservatives eager to support candidates who could win and avoid those whose devastating sound bites would energize @entity31			2
the same dynamic that was on display in the midterms will be true in the presidential primaries			0
@entity1 is likely to draw considerable support from key players in the @entity6 fund - raising machine			1
as soon as he made his announcement , @entity153 reported , a group of prominent @entity6 donors expressed their excitement			1
" he 's got proven executive experience , " said @entity6 bundler @entity158 , the finance chairman of the @entity159 that @entity3 currently heads			2
" he 's a uniter			0
he 's got political courage			0
" @entity1 will also be able to tap into many endorsements from prominent republicans who have been champing at the bit to have him run			2
while @entity1 is a conservative , without question , his record on the issues of immigration and education along with his demeanor will probably be enough to make a pitch that he is a coalition builder			1
politics : @entity1 will defend expanded immigration while his conservative record will be sufficient to counteract @entity69 frustration , @entity1 will be able to sell himself as part of a @entity6 cohort that is seeking to bring new people into the @entity6 fold and who is sensitive to the ways in which social and cultural issues have changed where the party stands on these issues			1
his record on immigration , as well education ( he supports @entity191 , the program that is controversial with many , including conservatives ) , combined with his immediate family will make it much tougher for @entity31 to paint him as far right of center , the strategy that has worked so well for them in recent years			0
it is less clear how well he will be able to deal with some of the economic concerns facing the @entity202 electorate			0
like most republicans , he will face @entity31 pointing to the evidence of economic recovery under president @entity100 , and he has close tied to the business , anti-tax establishment faction of the @entity6 that hurt @entity122 in 2012			1
the housing market started to crash in @entity9 toward the end of his term , though it did n't really take effect until after he got out			0
at the same time , he still will be able to tap into some of the anxiety of the middle class about the stability of this recovery , surely claiming credit for the current state of the @entity9 economy			0
finally there is the question of @entity1 fatigue			2
the biggest obstacle that @entity1 faces is his last name			2
the controversial ending of @entity227 's presidency and his terrible popularity ratings were a shadow that loomed over another @entity1 candidacy			2
but , especially in the short - attention span politics of the @entity202 , 2008 is a long time ago			0
the intense controversy over president @entity100 has redirected much of the political heat toward the @entity31 leader , while the traditional waves of nostalgia about the last president have started to set in			0
continued problems with foreign policy and the economy , as well as the extension of much of the homeland security program under president @entity100 , has undercut some of the claims that @entity1 was wholly to blame for the problems that bothered @entity202			1
the success of the @entity69 at shifting the @entity6 further to the right allows @entity1 's supporters to claim that the previous @entity6 president was not as extreme as his critics said			1
@entity1 is a good campaigner and he should n't be taken lightly			2
if he puts his full heart into this race , and it still remains unclear thus far that he will , @entity253 and other @entity6 contenders should be worried that the 2016 election could be another year for the @entity1 family			1
note : an earlier version of this article incorrectly described former president @entity227 ; he is @entity1 's older brother .			2

@entity261 : @entity1 may be @entity6 ' strongest candidate for 2016
he says @entity1 can get support of @entity6 donors and unite the party
@entity1 has conservative credentials while also appealing to larger electorate , he says
he says @entity1 may face opposition over economy and *baggage* over @entity1 name
