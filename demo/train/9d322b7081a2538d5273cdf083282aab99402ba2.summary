-- former @entity2 president @entity1 will be transferred to the @entity3 to serve a 50 - year sentence for aiding war crimes in neighboring @entity6 , the @entity3 @entity7 said			1
no date for his transfer was provided by the ministry			0
the announcement comes two weeks after @entity13 - backed @entity12 ruled to uphold the sentence , rejecting an appeal			0
another country like the @entity3 had to offer to enforce the sentence against @entity1 because the special tribunal does n't have a prison facility			1
@entity1 , 65 , was found guilty last year of supplying and encouraging rebels in @entity6 in a campaign of terror , involving murder , rape , sexual slavery , looting and the conscription of children younger than 15			1
he was also convicted of using @entity6 's diamond deposits to help fuel its civil war with arms and guns while enriching himself with what have commonly come to be known as " blood diamonds			1
" both the defense and prosecution lodged appeals after the court convicted the former president of all 11 counts against him , following a trial lasting nearly four years			2
@entity1 's defense appealed the court 's judgment and sentence on multiple grounds , arguing that the trial chamber had made mistakes in evaluating the evidence and in applying the law			1
but the appeals judges rejected those arguments , saying that the trial chamber had " thoroughly evaluated the evidence for its credibility and reliability , " and that its assessment of @entity1 's criminal responsibility and liability was in accordance with international laws			1
the appeals judges also dismissed defense claims that @entity1 was not given a fair trial			0
the defense also argued that the 50 - year sentence handed down was " manifestly unreasonable , " while the prosecution had argued that it should be increased to 80 years to adequately reflect the gravity of his crimes			1
the appeals judges dismissed both claims , saying the sentence was fair and reasonable			0
rights group @entity74 welcomed the ruling , saying it sent a clear message to leaders around the world			0
" @entity83 's landmark ruling underlines that no one is above the law , " said @entity79 , head of @entity74 's @entity80 in the @entity81			2
" the conviction of those responsible for crimes committed during @entity6 's conflict has brought some measure of justice for the tens of thousands of victims			1
the conviction of @entity1 must pave the way for further prosecutions			2
" role in atrocities @entity1 was the first former head of state to be convicted of war crimes since the @entity99 that followed @entity100 the trial chamber heard that rebels from the @entity103 , which the former president backed , committed horrendous crimes against @entity6 civilians , including children			1
some were enslaved to mine the diamonds used to fund the rebels ' fight			0
the presiding trial judge described @entity1 as responsible for " aiding and abetting as well as planning some of the most heinous and brutal crimes recorded in human history			0
" but @entity1 said during his sentencing hearing in may 2012 that his role in the conflict was much different than represented			0
" i pushed the peace process hard , contrary to how i have been portrayed in this court , " he said			0
a pivotal figure in @entity2 politics for decades , he became president in 1997 and was forced out of office under international pressure in 2003			1
he fled to @entity126 , where border guards arrested him three years later as he was attempting to cross into @entity128			0
the @entity13 and the @entity6 government jointly set up the special tribunal to try those who played the biggest role in the atrocities			0
the court was moved to the @entity135 from @entity6 , where emotions about the civil war still run high			2
opinion : do war crimes trials really help victims ? @entity0 's @entity141 contributed to this report .			2
