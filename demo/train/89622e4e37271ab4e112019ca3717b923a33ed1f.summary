-- sitting in her trailer between filming scenes for " parenthood , " @entity1 is still in hair and makeup , but dressed in what could be considered her casual uniform : a pair of stretchy jeans tucked into boots , a tank top , and a current / @entity14 denim shirt			1
she 's nearly cornered the market on playing young , cool single moms , and it 's no accident : the 43 - year - old is warm , naturally pretty , and self - deprecatingly funny			1
but her devotion to living healthy is no joke			1
today , as she eats a lean lunch of brown rice and tuna , @entity1 talks to @entity23 about staying body - confident in @entity25 , and just how she earned herself the nickname " @entity27			1
" q : what does being healthy mean to you ? balance , and i think that is something you 're always aspiring to have			1
sometimes i 'll think , " that was a really nice day			1
i ate well , i exercised , i called some friends , was n't working too hard , " but i rarely have one of those			1
] they 're more often , " i 'm too tired , i did n't run as far as i wanted			2
" and so that 's something i 've gained peace with			1
i expect now for the day to be imperfect in some way			2
@entity0 : 25 shocking celebrity weight changes q : what 's your go - to power meal ? i guess it 's protein and vegetables			1
i 've pretty much always been on a diet since i was born			2
and the women in my family struggle , so i find the less i think about food , in a way , the happier i am			2
in general , i think i eat less the less i think about it			2
q : in what areas of your life are you most and least healthy ? i 'm probably most healthy in exercise			1
i 've always really liked being active			2
i do spinning classes , i run , i have a trainer , i do @entity66 with my sister @entity67			1
and i think work has been an area , historically , where i 've way overworked myself			2
but [ in the past ] i 've definitely spent a lot of time worrying about work , taking jobs when i maybe could have taken some time off - really pushing myself			1
although i 've gotten way way way better			2
q : what 's your favorite healthy - life advice ? just keep moving			1
someone said this to me a long time ago			2
it 's a @entity85 saying , i think : " there is no wasted effort			1
" it applies to so many things			2
it applies to being physical , like , " let 's take a walk outside			1
" and i never go take a walk outside , but it 's such a good idea ! no , you did n't burn 1,000 calories , but you got up after dinner , you walked outside , had fresh air			1
q : do you have a go - to way to lose a quick few pounds ? one thing i think is underrated is eating soup			1
i did this movie with @entity104 , and i do n't know if he was trying to lose weight or not , but he would carry around this thermos of soup			1
also , the best investment i made in the last year was a @entity109			2
you can put raw kale in the @entity109 , and you do n't even taste it when you put some fruit and ice in			2
it comes with all these insane recipes			2
you can make your own peanut butter			2
you can grind your own flour			2
] q : wow , have you done that ? no. are you kidding ? but i gave one to @entity119 for his 50th birthday , and he was like , " you 've made the peanut butter , right ? " and i was like , " nooo			0
q : are there any ways you stay fit that are more surprising than regular workouts ? i just had a vacation , and we went skiing			0
it was such a cool vacation because the whole day is around something active			0
and occasionally we 'd go to the gym at night			0
@entity0 : celebrity - inspired workout tips q : you really worked out after skiing ? yeah			1
that 's my boyfriend [ co-star @entity141 ] who works out like crazy			1
you would go to the gym at night because you 're tired , but you 've worked the strangest muscles , so you do n't feel like you 've worked out			0
q : if you 're ever feeling down about your looks , how do you get the body confidence you need ? well , part of my job is pretending			0
and i 've honestly never led with my looks			0
i 've always thought my strengths were i 'm smart , and i have a good sense of humor			0
i definitely struggle with feeling confident			0
we went to a party last night , and i always still feel like i 'm in high school : " did i wear the right thing ? do i look ok ? did i walk funny ? " like , i never feel comfortable , but i 've done this for so long that i just know i 'm not going to feel comfortable			0
that 's not the real me , you know ? @entity0 : @entity161 : curvy , confident , gorgeous q : any embarrassing fashion moments that tested your confidence ? i wore something this year that i got criticized for , and [ laughs ] it killed me ! and i was like , " but why did n't they like it ? " you want people to feel you made the right choice			1
but , i am who i am			0
i mean , honestly , i was such a tomboy as a kid			0
people were taking from their mothers ' closets -- i was taking from my dad 's closet			1
it was the ' 80s , so it was n't terrible , but i was wearing my dad 's dress shirts over jeans from the @entity184			1
and not the @entity184 now , but the gap when it was jeans and flannel shirts			0
that , to me , was a really good outfit			0
i have more access to beautiful clothes and help , but everybody makes mistakes ; that 's why there are worst - dressed lists			1
] q : what 's your go - to style now ? i think it 's @entity204 meets @entity205			1
growing up [ in @entity204 ] , i can remember a girl coming to me and saying , " do you want to be preppy with me ? " and i was like , " yes			0
" back then , you were disco or preppy			0
but then you come to @entity205 , and it 's a little more laid back and @entity210			1
my boyfriend has a friend who calls me @entity27 because i wear jeans tucked into boots 9 times out of 10 ! i have way too many jeans			0
but i never seem to have a top to wear			0
q : how do you feel about plastic surgery ? i do n't ever plan to do it , but i do n't know how i would feel			0
like , if you have worked with and hung out with , as i have , @entity222			0
she 's in such good shape , you know ? she , to my knowledge , has never had anything done			1
and why would you ? she looks great , and she does n't look fake			0
the standards have changed , and people do much more in that world than they used to			0
it 's not a fair playing field , in a way			1
i have an interest in looking good , but i have a fear of not looking like myself			0
i 've had much more success than i ever thought not being iconic in the beauty sense , so maybe i 'll just continue to rest on my personality			0
] q : is there a celebrity whose body and looks inspire you ? @entity245			0
she looks really great and not fake			0
and i think she has dignity and has handled her public life really well			1
q : do you have any beauty tricks that do n't come from a bottle ? i really think if you 're trying to look good , do something athletic			0
i have a little mini tramp , and sometimes i 'll just try to jump for 20 minutes			0
it gets your blood circulating and that always looks really pretty			0
q : what 's your ideal saturday night ? cooking for friends at my house -- although i always break that rule about not trying to cook something new when you are entertaining , so the results can be mixed			1
someday i will learn ! @entity23 2011			0
