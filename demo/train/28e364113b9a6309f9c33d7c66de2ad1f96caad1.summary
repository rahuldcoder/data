-- @entity2 scientist @entity1 almost did n't get the chance to make one of the greatest medical discoveries of the 20th century			1
she shared the 2008 @entity6 with her colleague @entity7 for identifying @entity8 , the virus that causes @entity9 , a plague that has killed about 35 million people since the 1980s			1
" never before has science and medicine been so quick to discover , identify the origin and provide treatment for a new disease entity , " according to the @entity17 committee			1
because of their discovery , scientists quickly developed a test for the virus			1
their discovery also led to the development of drugs that dramatically increased the life expectancy of hiv - positive patients			2
but had @entity1 listened to one leader at the lab where she would eventually find fame , she may never have been a scientist at all			1
natural aptitude @entity1 has loved science since she was a girl			1
but coming from a family of modest means , she decided to forgo a more expensive medical school to take the research route at the @entity35 at the @entity36			2
but she says she ended up spending little time in class			2
" this is not the advice i would give young people			2
university is important , " she warns			2
but she had another interest : she had fallen in love with lab work			1
about two years into her studies , she grew tired of the theoretical			2
she wanted to test her mettle in a lab. " it just was not done at the time , but i wanted to try , " she says			2
after dozens of rejections , she reached the famous virologist @entity51 at the @entity52			2
he made her an unusual offer			2
" he said , ' ok , if you want to be a volunteer here part time , that would be fine with me , ' " she recalls			2
" suddenly , i understood that 's what i really wanted to do			2
" her research then focused on the same family of viruses as @entity8			1
she worked to find a connection between retroviruses , cancer and leukemia in animals			2
friends shared their class notes so she could study late nights and weekends while spending full days at the lab. incredibly , she passed her exams with top marks			1
she stayed at @entity52 and earned her doctorate			2
at the end of her @entity77 in the late ' 70s , she made an appointment with another head of the institute			2
she wanted to know if she could continue working there			2
she remembers the indignant tone of the man 's response			2
" he said , ' you are expecting to have a position at @entity52 ? ' i said , ' that is one of my dreams			2
' and he said , ' a woman in science , they never do anything			1
they are only good at caring for the home and babies			2
' " instead , that conversation left her more determined to succeed			2
she went to do post-doctoral work at the @entity101 in @entity102 , @entity103			1
about a year later , she won a large grant , which meant a return to @entity52			2
she returned to @entity7 's unit ; his lab was one of the few still examining the connection between retroviruses and cancer			0
it was her dream job , and she 's been doing it ever since , eventually becoming the head of the @entity115 in 1992			0
nearly a decade earlier she performed the experiment that would change her life			0
the year that everything changed a clinician named @entity120 delivered a lunchtime lecture at the hospital at @entity52			0
he talked about a new mysterious disease that seemed to be rapidly killing his patients			0
many were young gay men who should have been at their healthiest			0
at the end of the lecture , he asked , " does anyone here deal with retroviruses ? " no one responded , said @entity1 , who was n't at the lecture			1
@entity120 went back to his clinic and complained to a friend that no one at @entity52 could help			0
his friend corrected him , telling him about the work of @entity7 and @entity1			1
in december 1982 , he met with their team and told them about the disease			1
@entity142 - @entity1 says she and @entity7 had never heard of it then , but they agreed to do some research			1
everything they could observe in the clinic told doctors that the virus was attacking patients ' immune cells , leaving them vulnerable to rare cancers and pneumonia			1
but there was a problem			0
as the disease progressed , it was hard to find enough @entity160 lymphocytes , or t cells , to use in the lab tests			0
it made isolating the virus extremely difficult			1
the following month , a patient agreed to let the researchers do a lymph node biopsy			0
@entity1 tested the sample every two days for activity			1
the first week there was nothing , but in the second , there was weak enzymatic activity			0
it started to increase quickly but just as suddenly dropped			0
the t lymphocytes in the culture started dying			0
" that was a really worrying day , " @entity1 says			1
she changed out all the reagent chemicals they were using , but that did n't stop the t cells from dying			0
the team was n't able to see the virus ; it was getting away			1
" so we knew it had to be something else , " @entity1 says			1
" we ran across the street to the blood bank and asked if we could get samples for our experiment			0
we knew it was urgent			0
" she added lymphocytes from the blood donation , and it worked			0
the virus was still there			1
the researchers knew because it started to infect the new lymphocytes from the blood donation and there was enough that a colleague was able to take the first actual image of the virus			1
the team named it lymphadenopathy - associated virus -- the name human immunodeficiency virus , or @entity8 , came later			1
" i called my good friend in the @entity214 , my former boss , and i told him what i thought we had and he joked with me and said , ' throw it all away , ' " @entity1 remembers			1
" ' this discovery will change your life forever			0
' " and it did			0
@entity1 and @entity7 quickly put a paper together about the results			1
it ran in the may 1983 issue of @entity226			0
she presented her findings at an international conference and was invited to talk about her results at the @entity101 and the @entity230			0
" so many people ask me if we were excited about the discovery , but so many young people were dying , " @entity1 says			1
hospitals were too afraid to accept patients because they did n't know how the virus spread			1
she recalls seeing young men in @entity239 with telltale signs of the illness			0
others , including the actor @entity243 , heard about the lab 's discovery of @entity8 and came to @entity52			1
some of them , she says , had only a suitcase and often no money			0
" they just wanted to be close to the place that made the discovery , " she says			0
" we knew we had to work to do , and it was urgent			1
" at the same time , an @entity214 lab claimed to have discovered the virus			1
a large legal battle and diplomatic fight raged for years			0
ultimately , after @entity2 and @entity214 heads of state intervened , in 1987 they were all named co-discoverers and split the royalties from the blood test			0
the @entity214 , however , did not win the @entity6			1
in 2008 , when the @entity6 winners were about to be announced , the @entity17 committee could n't find @entity142 - @entity1 to tell her			1
she had been working with doctors in @entity265			0
ever since she co-discovered the virus , she had traveled the world to try and help health professionals understand @entity8 better			1
she says the @entity17 committee called her lab and her home without luck			0
a reporter tracked her down first			0
" when i picked up my mobile , she said , ' @entity1 , have you heard ? ' and then she started to cry , " @entity1 says			1
" i thought something tragic had happened			0
i had already lost my husband that year and thought someone else must have died			0
" these were tears of happiness , the journalist said , delivering the @entity17 news			0
@entity142 - @entity1 says she could n't believe it			1
" it was like a dream , " she says			0
no resting on her laurels some people might retire after such an honor but not @entity1			1
she has used her fame to open more doors			0
she is president of the @entity291 and continues working with clinicians , patients and activists -- particularly those from the gay community and those who try to help people in the developing world -- as they fight to eliminate the stigma of the disease and get patients the care they need			0
" this is a good thing of the @entity6 -- it is easier for me to get an appointment with the first lady or the president of the country , " @entity1 says			1
" it gives me the opportunity to try to be the voice for others			0
this is something that for me seems to be my responsibility , my duty			0
" she says she has high hopes for a vaccine , noting that recent developments show some promise			0
" a total cure -- the total eradication of the virus will be extremely difficult if not impossible , " she says			1
" although in my language we say ' impossible ' is not @entity2 , so i can not say impossible			0
" the attention her discovery has brought @entity1 has changed everything , just like her friend warned , she says			1
it even won over the man who told her at the start of her career that a life in science would be impossible for a woman			1
he contacted her many years after the @entity8 discovery			1
" he called me to congratulate me and said how impressed he was , " she says			0
" after a while of him saying these positive things , i finally interrupted him and said , ' you mean , because a woman can actually do something in science ? ' " of course , he did not understand			1
he did not remember saying anything			0
i told him what he said			2
he could n't believe it			0
he said he felt so bad			0
' but you did , ' i told him			2
' and i 'm so glad i did not listen			0

@entity1 co-discovered @entity8 , the virus that causes @entity9
@entity1 shared the @entity6 for her work in 2008
a male colleague once told her that women in science " never do anything "
