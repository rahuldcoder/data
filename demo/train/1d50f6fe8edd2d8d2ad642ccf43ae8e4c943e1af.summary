-- the @entity1 : @entity2 twenty years ago , a friend and i were visiting the @entity5 in @entity6 and saw an exhibit of @entity9 quilts			1
i 'll never forget one particular piece by the artist @entity11 -- a family sitting at a @entity13 table , with their thoughts sewn into the fabric			1
i just knew right away : i wanted to tell stories with cotton			1
it 's exciting to start on a quilt			1
i tape paper to my wall and sketch patterns and notes			1
going to the fabric store for the right colors or prints feels as important as the actual sewing			1
and then i clear out a huge empty space in my family room , and i get busy			1
i do n't know how to draw , so it amazes me that this magical , creative part of me comes out			1
here 's an example : a few years ago , when i was yearning for a date on a friday night , i asked myself , " how can i capture this feeling in fabric ? " so i made a quilt that reads " @entity39 praying for a @entity40 to share my quilt			1
" the image is of a black woman , and if you look really closely , the background pattern is filled with couples			1
i love layering the story like that			1
i probably could n't make a living quilting , and i 'm glad of that			1
my 9 - to - 5 job as a product manager means i do n't have to make quilts to sell			1
there 's a freedom to being pure to the art , to not being motivated to pay the mortgage with it			1
my quilts are motivated only by my need to tell my story			1
@entity0 : the 4 - step plan to get your life on track the coach : @entity67 as a kid , i was a horse nut , a real barn rat			1
i would spend every saturday at the stables , grooming horses , mucking stalls -- anything for extra rides			1
but when i went to college , my obsession fizzled out			1
i got a job in book publishing and started spending my days in front of a computer , stuck in my head			2
i like what i do , but as time passed , i just began to crave something wildly different			2
then , three years ago , i came across a video about horses helping children with disabilities			1
i felt like it was speaking directly to me			2
on my first day as a volunteer , i was paired with a 9 - year - old girl who had severe developmental and physical disabilities			1
my job was to walk alongside her for support			2
when she got in the saddle of a big brown swayback , her face lit up			2
she could n't stop laughing ! i saw other kids in wheelchairs -- kids who spend all day looking up at people -- sitting in the saddle and grinning like they were on top of the world			2
there 's no office equivalent , no matter how much you enjoy your day job			2
i 've since become a certified riding instructor			2
for six months a year , i 'm at the stable on saturdays from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. it 's something i do n't technically have time for -- i 've missed weekends away with friends , and i schedule " summer " vacations for march because the program starts in april -- but you make time for things that matter			2
@entity0 : 26 ways to tell your story and share it with the world the cheese - maker : @entity124 my family is from @entity126 , so i 've always liked cheese , but my interest did n't get intense until a few years ago			1
i felt antsy at my desk job , so i started a club : each week a coworker would bring in a few cheeses to share			2
for my turn , i visited a cheesemonger in a specialty shop			2
we shared a piece of @entity138 -- sort of like a @entity139 ¨ re -- and i could taste hay and onion			2
he said , " oh , the cow must 've gotten into an onion patch			2
" i was standing in this busy , fancy shop in @entity147 and tasting a connection to a cow in @entity150 -- it blew my mind			0
@entity0 : 6 words that can change how you look at your life i started talking to other cheesemongers			0
they can be a grumpy group , but i 'd visit again and again and ask for offbeat offerings			0
the more i learned , the more i wanted to try crafting simple ingredients into amazing flavors			1
making cheese turned out to feel like a big brain stretch			1
you focus on basic things , like watching milk change , and your mind gets quiet			0
my apartment is tiny , but it has become something of a workshop			0
a kitchen hook drains soft cheeses into the sink			0
two small fridges age my wheels of @entity175 and @entity176			0
i make cheese every week , and i 've been teaching mozzarella classes as well , so huge pots and bowls are perched on shelves			1
anyone who walks in can tell who i am : i 'm a cheesemaker			0
@entity0 : 4 ways to be happier on the job the pianist : @entity187 the first time i saw a piano , i was in first grade			0
my teacher played " @entity194 , " and that was it : i wanted to play			1
when the others ran to recess , i would practice scales			0
my parents did n't go to church , but i went with my art teacher , to play piano there			0
i begged for lessons and finally began at age 9			0
at 11 , i told my teachers that i wanted to be a concert pianist			1
they said the odds were slim , and that i 'd have to win the @entity209 -- a one - in - a - million shot			0
that was pretty discouraging , and as time passed , i grew away from music and instead pursued mathematics			0
for years i worked as an astrophysicist and had time for little else			0
but three years ago , when i switched jobs , i found myself thinking of the piano			0
at age 34 , i decided to begin again			0
as soon as i sat at the keys , i felt as if i 'd entered a room made just for me			0
in the beginning , i used an electric keyboard and pretended i was on a grand piano			0
buying a used @entity225 last year was a real commitment			0
it makes such a booming sound , my husband and i moved to a bigger apartment so i can play for an hour or two every day			0
since i started practicing on my concert grand , i 've won an international competition and performed at a fund - raiser at @entity234			0
onstage , i could feel myself filling with light			0
these are the best moments of my life			0
