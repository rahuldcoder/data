@entity0 -- @entity3 presidential frontrunner @entity2 chose to spend the final day of his first round campaign in the @entity5 , an area famous for that most @entity6 of luxuries -- champagne			1
some of the vintners he met there may well be disappointed to learn the @entity14 candidate chose not to crack open that ceremonial bottle of bubbly after sailing to victory on april 22			0
@entity1 was informed he toasted with red wine instead			0
with 28.6 % of the initial vote , @entity2 will be pitted against incumbent conservative president @entity20 's 27.2 % in a run off on may 6			1
does @entity20 need a miracle ? before the final showdown , each side will try to win support from the eight other parties who failed to make the cut			1
key to their success will be proposals to tackle immigration , the eurozone crisis and , above all , @entity3 's domestic economy			1
high times , hard times nestled in the north east of the country , near the border with @entity41 , @entity3 's champagne belt provides a unique glimpse into one of @entity45 's most protected agrarian economies			1
the region is something of a national treasure while also being heavily reliant on exports abroad			0
at its heart is the picturesque town of @entity0			0
the champagne business is big money			1
revenues last year amounted to â‚¬ 4.4 billion ( $ 5.8 billion )			1
and despite finances being fragile these days , the champagne industry 's trade body , the @entity59 du @entity58 , says the world quaffed around 323 million bottles of the stuff last year			1
but champagne producers remain aware of potential challenges on the horizon			1
@entity20 relishes tough battle " how can i put it ? " says @entity68 , owner of the 300 - year - old champagne house -- or " maison " -- @entity73			1
" to make champagne you need good weather , good soil , good grapes but you also need a good economic climate			2
" @entity68 's firm has survived two world wars and one revolution			2
now into its 12th generation , centuries of investment have left the family well placed to weather the storm			0
annual revenues reach around $ 4 million			2
but with net income only hitting a tenth of that figure , making this finite commodity is n't cheap			2
only 33,500 hectares of prize vineyards can give rise to the wine that will ultimately become champagne			2
just three varieties of grape are used : one white and two red			0
though the actual process of making the champagne may be standardized , the ( often secret ) blends are not -- thus leading to a plethora of distinct champagnes to sample for anyone lucky enough to visit the region			1
pricey to drink and expensive to make producing champagne requires extensive experience , and the bottles must mature for three to six -- sometimes even nine -- years before consumption			2
the result : a vibrant wine carrying the promise of high labor and storage costs			0
not to mention concerns about varying levels of stock from one year to the next			2
over a glass of his fresh and fruity @entity124 ( $ 40 a bottle ) @entity122 explains why , after 20 years at prestige houses like @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 , he decided to go it alone			2
" my wife , @entity132 , and i are from this region			0
our family had land and it made sense			0
we were passionate and convinced we could make great wines , " he said			0
economy : @entity3 election 's unspoken issue and the @entity142 are finally reaping what they sowed			1
after six years of hefty investment , @entity144 is posting a profit			0
into only their third year of trade , the @entity142 now count top hotel groups among their clients , like @entity150 and the @entity151			2
@entity152 in @entity153 can find @entity144 on top tables , like @entity156 's eponymous culinary mecca in the 8th arrondissement , a winner of 3 @entity160 stars			2
what @entity122 would really like to see from the next @entity3 government is support for those who take risks to start a business			1
with ambitions to expand his foreign customer base , @entity122 also reckons the viability and stability of the common currency are crucial			0
" we need the euro			0
as champagne producers @entity3 is n't the only market for us			1
much of the champagne we make in this region is sold elsewhere , " he said			0
wine of kings and the king of wines last year , six out of the top 10 foreign markets for the luxury liquor were outside the eurozone			1
the rest include supposedly cash - strapped countries like @entity189 and @entity190 , which also make their own rival sparkling wines			0
yet @entity3 still has the biggest thirst for its royal nectar			1
in 2011 domestic demand swallowed 56 % of bottles sold			0
as such , talk by @entity2 of a 75 % tax on the nation 's wealthiest citizens risks eroding demand for @entity58 in its target market			1
how @entity203 sex scandal boosted @entity20 rival " it will probably not hurt the big fortunes too much but effectively it 's a concern , " concedes @entity122			1
if anything , he says , unlike his latest vintage this year 's elections have left him rather flat			1
" no one seems to be tackling the real issues that matter to people , " he said			0
both @entity20 and @entity2 aim to balance the books but they differ on how to achieve that goal			1
the center - right says controlling spending is the way forward whereas those on the left would rather focus on growth			0
the one thing they do agree on -- much to @entity68 's delight -- is a proposed tax on financial transactions , which the winemaker says should rein in " speculators who do nothing to contribute or support @entity3 's economy			1
'' the economist @entity231 , famed for encouraging governments to spend their way back to health , once quipped that his " only regret in life " was that he " did n't drink enough champagne			0
" @entity58 socialists the world over -- or the @entity238 in @entity3 -- have often trotted out his rhetoric as justification for splashing the cash during a downturn			2
so , is @entity3 ready for its first left - wing leader in 17 years ? " i 'm not sure , " muses @entity68			1
" mind you , it could be a bit like @entity58			0
it 's cold up here and we make white wine out of red			0
" he adds : " on paper it should n't work but somehow it does and now this region is rich			0
