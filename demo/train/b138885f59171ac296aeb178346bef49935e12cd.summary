-- @entity2 has " successfully " test fired its newest version of the @entity6 missile , state media reported saturday , touting the accomplishment despite international concerns about @entity10 's growing military capabilities			1
footage from state - run @entity12 showed a missile on a rocket launcher in a desert area being fired into the air , before seemingly falling somewhere over the horizon			0
gen. @entity19 said that the test launch of the missile -- a " fourth generation " of the @entity6 -- was a success , according to the official @entity24			1
" @entity2 is among few ... countries capable of producing such missiles , " the minister said in the @entity24 report			2
the latest @entity6 version -- which was tested two years after @entity2 successfully tested the previous model -- is capable of traveling 300 kilometers ( 185 miles ) and " can target spots without any diversion , " @entity24 reported			1
the defense ministry plans to have all home - made missiles with " this new capability , " said @entity19			0
@entity2 's developing missile program has been a hot topic in @entity39 and elsewhere in recent months , with a new @entity41 report last month finding that @entity10 may test a missile that could reach the @entity44 mainland within three years			1
" @entity2 has boosted the lethality and effectiveness of existing systems with accuracy improvements and new submunition payloads , " which allow missiles to drop explosives over a wider area thus causing more destruction , according to the @entity41 report			2
the report , which was signed by @entity44 defense secretary @entity56 and sent to senators and @entity44 representatives on defense committees , said @entity2 is continuing to develop other missiles that can hit @entity61 and @entity62 , including an extended - range @entity63 and a medium - range ballistic missile called the @entity65 that can fly more than 1,200 miles			1
@entity2 is still capable of testing a long - range intercontinental ballistic missile by 2015 " without sufficient foreign assistance , " the report added			2
the @entity44 and @entity70 have begun to field an anti-ballistic missile shield in the southern and eastern parts of @entity62 to protect from such a threat			0
but @entity74 , a weapons analyst with the @entity76 research group , said the missile shield is not yet fully operational			0
@entity39 has led international efforts aimed at stymieing @entity10 's nuclear program , as well as its ballistic missile proliferation activities			0
but despite widespread sanctions , @entity2 officials have been publicly defiant and regularly highlight developments in both arenas .			0
