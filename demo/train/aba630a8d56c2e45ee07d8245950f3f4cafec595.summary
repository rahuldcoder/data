" actresses having to appeal to impossible physical standards ? @entity36 lost 45 pounds for " @entity37 , " or " what actresses call ' being in a movie			1
' " the only downside of their hosting was there was much less of it than there could have been			0

we have our @entity6 front - runners			1
" @entity58 " won best motion picture drama			0

but the @entity96 - born actor , who has given his acting career new life with such films as " @entity100 , " " @entity101 " and a small but pivotal performance in " @entity103 of @entity104 , " has put himself in the forefront of the best actor conversation			2

@entity114 apologies for @entity117 ' @entity116 ' during @entity1 4			1
it 's a long walk to the winner 's circle			2

@entity133 disses estranged dad @entity135 's @entity1 tribute 5			1
