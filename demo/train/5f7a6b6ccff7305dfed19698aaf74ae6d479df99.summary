@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity6 winner @entity5 will be represented friday at the ceremony bestowing the honor by an empty chair , the second time such a symbol has been used in the event , the chairman of the @entity4 said thursday			1
@entity13 told reporters that the gesture is not a protest			0
" it is a signal to @entity19 that it would be very important for @entity19 's future to combine economic development with political reforms and it is support for those people in @entity19 who are struggling for basic human rights , " @entity13 said at a news conference			1
@entity5 , a professor of literature , is serving an 11 - year sentence in a @entity19 prison for what the government called " inciting subversion of state power			1
" he was not allowed to travel to @entity1 to accept the prize , nor was his wife , @entity33			2
@entity19 has responded furiously since the @entity4 committee announced its peace prize winner on october 8			1
officials have repeatedly called @entity5 a common criminal and declared the award a @entity40 plot against @entity19			2
@entity41 also put pressure on its allies and other countries not to attend the peace prize ceremony , and it hastily announced its own honor -- the @entity47 , which was awarded thursday to former @entity49 vice president @entity48			1
that award was accepted by a 6 - year - old girl on @entity48 's behalf			2
@entity48 did not know about the prize , his office said			0
@entity13 said the pressure from @entity19 was not a surprise , and that it was up to @entity41 to decide on its own behavior			2
" there are several peace prizes in the world , " he said			0
" if someone wants to compete with the @entity6 , i welcome that competition , it only makes us better			0
" the last time an empty chair was used to represent an absent winner was when @entity68 peace activist @entity67 won the 1935 award , according to @entity70 , director of the @entity71			1
@entity67 was under " protective custody " in @entity73 and could not come to accept the award in person , nor was he represented by anyone			0
three other @entity4 peace laureates were also unable to attend their ceremonies due to political reasons -- human rights activist @entity80 , @entity82 trade union leader @entity81 , and @entity85 @entity84 dissident @entity83 -- but spouses or other relatives were able to accept the awards on their behalf			1
as for @entity19 's pressure on other countries to boycott the ceremonies , @entity13 said the committee expected a " harsh reaction " from @entity41			1
but " we are very glad to see that two - thirds of the nations that have embassies in @entity0 will be attending the ceremony , and most of them are very big , very important countries , " he added			0
@entity70 said of the 19 countries that declined to come to the ceremony friday -- including @entity19 , @entity85 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 -- two had now reconsidered : @entity109 and the @entity110			1
the ceremony will include songs by a children 's choir -- a special request made by @entity5 through his wife , according to @entity70			0
and @entity1 actress @entity117 will read one of @entity5 's " most interesting and beautiful texts , " @entity13 said			0
he predicted that keeping @entity5 , 54 , in prison for the entirety of his 11 - year sentence may prove to be impossible for @entity19 once the prize is awarded			1
" the pressure from the outside world will be on @entity19 to release him			2
in today 's world , it is totally impossible to close a country			0
we already know that a lot of @entity19 know about the prize , and this is creating a huge pressure on @entity19 , " @entity13 said			1
" i believe this is one of the most influential @entity6 that have been awarded through the years			0
" " the demand now from the world community must be that these economic reforms ( by @entity19 ) are being followed up by political reforms , " he added			1
several foreign news websites -- including @entity2 and @entity140 -- were blocked in mainland @entity19 thursday			1
broadcasts of @entity142 are being blacked out intermittently , when news of the peace prize is reported , according to @entity2 beijing bureau chief @entity145			1
" we are required to beam our signal through a @entity19 satellite station before it is broadcast to mainland @entity19			1
that creates a 12 - second delay			0
authorities use that time to black out specific parts of the signal , " he explained			2
@entity145 said most @entity19 are likely not aware that @entity5 has been awarded the prestigious award			1
" whatever they may have read about him has been through official talking points and state commentary , " he said			0
@entity161 said it had received report that @entity19 diplomats in @entity1 have been pressuring @entity19 residents into joining @entity166 demonstrations when the award ceremony is held friday			2
the human rights group did not say how it learned of this , only offering that it has been " informed by reliable sources			0
" answering critics who claim that the award is based on the @entity40 standards of human rights , @entity13 said the criteria are from the universal rights and values described in the @entity179 @entity178			0
" all the dissidents in @entity19 , they are advocating over common universal rights , " he said			2
" yes , there are different parts to a democracy , but one thing is absolutely clear : you can not have democracy without freedom of expression , and that is clearly stated in the declaration of human rights			0
" @entity2 's @entity194 contributed to this report .			0
