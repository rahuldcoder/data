-- @entity2 ceo @entity1 expects @entity3 , the world 's most populous country , to become the no. 1 market for the company			1
equally heavyweight tech companies @entity7 or @entity8 can only watch with envy			1
it is not because of lack of effort that they are nowhere near the success of @entity2 in @entity3			1
their businesses are just too different			0
the @entity3 government 's tight control on freedom of information flow applies especially to the @entity22			2
web access is filtered on a regular basis			0
social media websites such as @entity8 and @entity26 are blocked because the government deems them as potential hot spots for facilitating politically sensitive or socially inappropriate content			2
meanwhile , @entity7 is operational in @entity3 but has to route all searches to its @entity32 site , and the access is often interrupted			1
so , it is fair to say that the @entity3 government is the reason why companies such as @entity7 and @entity8 are not doing well in @entity3			1
in contrast , @entity2 mainly sells hardware , so it has not run into any censorship problems			1
@entity3 consumers love electronic gadgets			2
@entity2 is doing incredibly well because its products are so much more attractive and pricy			2
the @entity45 quickly become a status symbol product in @entity3 social circles since its debut			1
likewise , the @entity49 also joined the must - have list as soon as it was launched			2
if someone wants to lubricate his " guanxi " -- relationship -- with an important person , these two products are often the gift of choice			0
before the @entity49 reached @entity3 , a businessman in @entity60 told me that in the back of his car trunk , he had stocked at least 20 @entity49 , all bought in @entity32			1
" it is the most - loved present for government officials , " he claimed			0
the social pressure of having an @entity2 product is strong , especially as the wealthy elites set the trend			1
if a middle class @entity3 consumer can not afford an expensive car or watch , sporting an @entity45 may be just as good			1
even the bad press surrounding @entity76 , the main manufacturer of @entity2 products , did not make too much of a dent on the company 's sales			2
there is no doubt that @entity3 will be an important market for @entity2 in the coming years			1
among the three main telecommunications companies in the country , @entity84 is the only one without @entity2 's @entity45 support despite the fact that it is the largest operator with nearly 700 million subscribers			0
many high - end @entity84 customers still stay in @entity93 because @entity84 's @entity94 does not have iphones			0
if @entity84 gets its own version of @entity45 , as rumor has it recently , then it would be a shot in the arm for @entity2			0
interestingly enough , @entity2 's growth in @entity3 is all from its hardware			1
its @entity107 store sales from music , videos , books or apps downloads are almost negligible			0
this has nothing to do with the government			0
there is no censorship of @entity107 other than @entity2 's own self - screening mechanism			2
poor sales from @entity117 owe more to the fact that the @entity3 are habitually reluctant to pay for intellectual properties			0
to make things worse , there are so many websites that offer " jailbreak " tips so that people can easily bypass @entity2 and get free downloads elsewhere			0
there are rumors that @entity2 might consider adding a cheaper version of the @entity45 for the @entity3 market			1
in light of the fast growing smartphone market , cheaper phones seem to make sense especially since there are still millions of @entity3 who can not afford a pricy iphone of 5000 yuan ( roughly $ 800 dollars )			2
but @entity2 should stay away from the idea			0
it does not make sense to sacrifice profit margin just for a greater market share			0
doing so would tarnish the premium image of @entity2 and erode the love and loyalty of the elites			2
one lesson that @entity2 can learn is that not long ago , @entity148 used to own the @entity3 market but it became so popular that it lost its appeal to the elites			1
@entity148 ended up trying a new brand , @entity152 , to entice consumers , but it was not very successful			0
by building more retail stores in @entity3 , @entity2 would certainly accelerate its growth			1
but the challenge is to maintain its prestige so that consumers would not lose interest and crave for a new elite brand			0
@entity2 might also want to rethink its @entity117 business model in @entity3 so that it can generate sales in other ways			1
one day , @entity2 products can and will be replaced			0
but demand for books , movies , music , and apps is ongoing			0
will @entity2 find a way to tap into the @entity3 consumption for content ? we 'll just have to see			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity177 .			0

@entity2 ceo @entity1 expects @entity3 to become the no. 1 market for the company
@entity177 : @entity7 or @entity8 can only watch with envy
he says @entity2 mainly sells hardware , which does *n't* run into censorship problems
@entity177 : iphones and @entity49 are also considered status symbols among elites
