@entity0 -- ten years ago , teen @entity2 shot a man during an attempted robbery and was sentenced to six to 12 years in prison			2
during his time behind bars , @entity6 racked up almost 30 disciplinary infractions , was kicked out of two separate facilities for bad behavior and reportedly spent hundreds of days in the hole because of his conduct			0
after serving 10 years , @entity6 was released last august			0
according to @entity1 affiliate @entity15 , he allegedly assaulted several police officers days later			0
then , in september , he allegedly killed a @entity18 police officer before being fatally shot by another officer			0
we see classic cases of repeat offenders like this all the time			1
a teen is thrown into the abyss of the corrections system and comes back out no better , if not worse			2
if we had the right intervention for troubled teens , could we reduce their chances of becoming repeat offenders ? the fact that we constantly have to ask that question tells me @entity33 needs to change the way it fights crime			1
as a nation , we 're very good at locking criminals up , yet we still remain one of the most violent and crime - ridden societies in the developed world			1
according to the @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity44 , the @entity33 has the world 's highest incarceration rate , with one in 100 adults behind bars			0
in fact , the @entity33 accounts for less than five percent of the world 's population , but almost a quarter of the world 's prisoners			0
considering how much time , energy and money we spend locking people up , you 'd expect to see a bigger payoff			1
but in the @entity33 there are about 16,000 homicides per year , or roughly six per 100,000 people , based on @entity64 statistics			0
compare that to @entity66 and @entity67 , which do n't even tally 1,000 homicides per year each			2
our current system is broken because it is too focused on tossing criminals behind bars and hoping they get the message instead of rehabilitating them			0
i 'm not saying we need to stop punishing criminals			0
we just need to start peppering in prevention techniques and using creative solutions to identify red flags early			0
quietly , the pendulum is swinging in that direction			0
@entity83 's groundbreaking juvenile justice system is the vanguard			1
it focuses on rehabilitation , therapeutic intervention and conflict resolution rather than force and punishment			0
small groups of youths stay in dorms with a couple of adult facilitators to emphasize individual treatment			0
according to @entity98 's @entity97 , the youths attend daily meetings with peers , partake in educational and volunteer programs and serve as role models for each other			2
this approach appears to be bearing dividends , as the @entity64 points out over 90 percent of @entity83 youths avoid further incarceration for at least three years after graduating from the program			1
thanks in part to these detention alternatives , @entity83 's adult prison population decreased from 2005 to 2007 after increasing each year from 1997 to 2003 , according to the @entity113			1
other states are catching on to the @entity83 model			1
the @entity116 , a leading supporter of alternative juvenile justice , says there are more than 100 sites using juvenile detention alternatives in 24 states and the @entity123			0
the proliferation of these alternatives may be having nationwide effects			0
the national juvenile arrest rate has decreased nearly 10 percent from 2000 to 2007 , according to @entity129 arrest statistics			0
obviously the @entity83 model is n't the only factor at play , but imagine the impact if we could spread those programs to the other 26 states			1
so how will we get the remaining " tough against crime " politicians to implement similar systems ? by showing them how it will fatten up the government 's coffers			2
the @entity83 model has been shown to reduce recidivism , meaning states will have fewer repeat offenders to incarcerate			1
and the best way to reduce prison costs is to reduce incarceration			2
i think certain aspects of the @entity83 model must be expanded beyond corrections systems			1
after all , why should juvenile offenders be the only ones learning conflict resolution and peer counseling ? we should offer similar tools -- such as group therapy -- in public high schools to help all troubled kids before a potential descent into criminality			1
in these school - based programs , no topic should be off limits			2
alcohol , drugs , sex , money -- whatever is bothering these children , they should have a place to share experiences , learn to cope with adversity and simply have someone willing to listen			2
such a program would also enable children to discuss issues that they are unwilling or unable to share with their parents			0
as a recovering alcoholic , i know how powerful and effective therapeutic programs are			2
they help you dissect a problem and uncover its cause			1
therapy helps millions of people with a variety of issues , yet most kids are n't exposed to these incredible tools when they need it most ( unless they have rich parents to pay for therapy sessions )			1
it is very promising to see that @entity33 is moving toward a balance of punishment and prevention , thanks to inventive ideas like the @entity83 model			1
no matter how many prisons we build and criminals we lock up , the fact remains the best way to fight crime is to stop it at the source			1
and that is exactly what these creative solutions aim to do			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity218 .			1

@entity218 : locking up teen offenders wo n't solve problem of repeat crimes
she says teens need therapy to help uncover source of their problems
@entity83 has *lowered* repeat crime by using innovative programs for teen offenders
she says such efforts can not only reduce crime but also save money
