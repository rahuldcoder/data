in additional taxes on monday , while denying any fiscal " irregularities " in its purchase of @entity7 superstar @entity6 , which is now under investigation by a court			1
@entity1 announced the surprise payment on its website , which it called " voluntary , " just four days after a judge at @entity15 's @entity14 in @entity16 filed preliminary charges against the fan - owned club for alleged tax fraud in the @entity6 deal			1
" the board ( of @entity1 ) denies the existence of any tax - related crime in relation to the fiscal obligations arising from the signing of the player ( @entity6 ) , " the club 's website said			1
" throughout the process , the club was receiving expert advice and at every moment the club 's auditor was informed and had access to all the documentation concerning the negotiations			0
" last thursday , judge @entity39 expanded his investigation against the club , as requested a day earlier by a prosecutor , who alleged the club avoided paying 9 million euros ( more than $ 12 million ) in taxes on @entity6 's signing and transfer , corresponding to contracts signed in 2011 and 2013			1
the judge is already investigating whether a former @entity1 president committed financial irregularities in the signing of @entity6			1
the club said on its website monday : " given the existence of a possible divergent interpretation of the exact amount of tax responsibility arising from the signing , and to defend the club 's reputation and good name , @entity1 has this morning made a complementary tax declaration of a total of 13,550,830.56 euros			0
" the reason , the club added , was " to cover any potential interpretation made concerning the contracts signed in the transfer process for @entity6 , although we remain convinced that the original tax payment was in line with our fiscal obligations			1
" judge @entity39 said in his writ last thursday that the investigation would include a look at an alleged " contract simulation presumably carried out by the parties which signed the contracts			0
" the expanded investigation would hold @entity1 responsible as an entity or business enterprise if found guilty of tax fraud , said a @entity14 spokesman , who by custom is not identified			1
the judge ordered @entity15 's tax collection agency to examine @entity1 's tax filings for 2011 , 2012 and 2013 , the writ said			2

@entity1 's former president , @entity90 , who resigned last month after a judge agreed to investigate a lawsuit against him for alleged irregularities in the @entity6 deal , has denied any wrongdoing			1
@entity39 began the investigation last month after a legal complaint from one of the club 's members			0
prosecutor @entity101 last wednesday formally asked the judge to expand the investigation			0
in his writ , @entity101 alleges that he 's " become aware of a series of economic transactions by the club , and in favor of various companies , related to the signing of @entity111 , based at times on simulated contracts			0
" the investigation originally came after season - ticket holder @entity115 complained that the amount paid to bring @entity6 from @entity7 side @entity118 was more than the reported fee of 57.1 million euros			0
a day after @entity90 resigned , the club released figures that showed that @entity1 actually paid 86.2 million euros for @entity6			2
cases ' lawyer , @entity121 , earlier told @entity0 that other @entity1 executives , still working at the club after @entity90 's resignation , also allegedly signed some of the contracts that brought @entity6 to the club			2
