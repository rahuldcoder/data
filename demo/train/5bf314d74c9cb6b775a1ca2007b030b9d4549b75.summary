catch you later , @entity3			0
and all of you @entity4 can take a hike			0
after several years of success with vampires , zombies and ( to a lesser extent ) werewolves , @entity6 now ca n't seem to get enough of witches			1
@entity14 debuted its high - profile series " @entity16 " on sunday night , and tonight comes the premiere of the third season of " @entity19 , " also focusing on witchcraft , subtitled " @entity21			1
" on the big screen this year , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 bewitched @entity26 in the smash hit movie " @entity29			0
" even the @entity31 's much - hyped " @entity32 " spinoff , " @entity33 , " focuses on spell - casters in a big way			1
and this is all taking place while there is a @entity40 season surge in popularity for @entity43 's " @entity42 , " celebrating its 20th anniversary			1
what 's behind this interest in witchcraft on the big and small screens , right as we approach the 50th anniversary of " bewitched , " no less ? " witchy women with magical mysterious powers suggest a wealth of storylines , " said tv critic @entity51			2
" and since ' bewitched , ' witches have seldom been entirely out of the tv mix. it also helps , of course , if you 're a comely , voluptuous witch			2
@entity61 from the old - school ' @entity62 ' mold need not apply			0
" @entity51 recalled a line from " @entity16 " : " you only have one superpower , and it 's your breasts			1
" @entity67 of the @entity68 noted that @entity6 's modern witches all tend to be uniformly attractive as well			1
" the current female witches on tv ( there are no high - profile male wizards or warlocks , like a @entity76 figure ) are also really sexy , " she said			2
" so , maybe they 're a kind of gendered response to the suave , seductive male vampire figure			0
or maybe it 's just cyclical , and all of the childhood fans of ' @entity42 , ' ' @entity83 ' and ' charmed ' are writing for tv now ! " @entity67 thinks it 's a positive trend overall			1
" vampires , zombies and werewolves have all gotten so much attention lately , i think we 're definitely reaching a saturation point , " she said			0
" the featured supernatural characters on those shows are usually men , too ( not exclusively , but overwhelmingly )			0
these new witch characters are giving women more power and agency to control their destinies , instead of just being objects of desire in need of saving , which is a nice change			0

witches seem to be the latest trend to take @entity6 by storm
" @entity19 : @entity21 " set to debut just days after " @entity16 "
@entity6 's new witches have more sex appeal than in years past
