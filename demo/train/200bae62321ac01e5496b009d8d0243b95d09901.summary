imaginations everywhere have been stoked since @entity2 ceo @entity1 announced his company plans to start offering 30 - minute deliveries via drone - like " octocopters			1
" what 's not fascinating about a near future in which fleets of whirring sky robots can drop our every impulse buy on our doorstep faster than we can get @entity13 delivered ? ( you know , aside from accidental strayings into restricted air space or the rise of the machines			2
) but when @entity1 took to " @entity21 " on sunday to introduce the world to @entity23 , his idea prompted more questions than it provided answers			1
so how close are we , really , to door - to - door drones becoming a reality ? and how would they work ? we reached out to @entity2 , where official details are still scarce , and chatted with drone expert @entity31 , an associate professor at @entity32 and one of the @entity35 's first female fighter pilots			1
here 's some of what we 've been able to piece together on a project that @entity2 says is , at the very least , a couple of years away from takeoff			1
could drones really be delivering packages by 2015 ? that 's what @entity1 said is the best possible scenario			1
but @entity31 , a longtime advocate for the commercial use of drones , thinks that 's optimistic			1
the @entity47 needs to sign off on @entity2 's flight plans , and @entity31 says the agency has n't been quick to move on the domestic use of drones			2
" i think they ( @entity2 ) are stepping out in a typically naive way , ( but ) maybe they have some secret insight to the @entity47 that i do n't have , " she said			2
@entity31 predicts the company will get approval to start @entity23 in other countries before the @entity58 , but she says that having a retail and technology giant like @entity2 pushing for it could speed things up for everyone			1
" i do n't want anybody to think this is right around the corner , " @entity1 warned during the " @entity21 " interview			1
how will i know if i 'm eligible for a drone visit ? @entity1 said the octocopters will have a 10 - mile radius			1
so , it 's likely that folks in big cities near @entity2 distribution sites would be a lot more likely to qualify than those in more remote areas			0
he says they 'll initially carry items up to five pounds , which is roughly 86 % of all deliveries @entity2 makes			1
the best @entity82 jokes about @entity2 's drones but for even that 10 - mile range to work , @entity2 better be onto something about battery life that the rest of us do n't know			1
@entity31 said drones the size of the octocopters have a battery life of about 30 minutes , and the weight of their cargo could make that even shorter			1
what will keep people from shooting them down ? ok , it 's perhaps a little off - topic			0
but every single conversation we 've had about the @entity2 drones has , at some point , ended up focused on the innate human desire to knock stuff out of the sky , preferably with a loud bang			0
@entity31 joked about producing a reality show in which marksmen from different states compete to see how many octocopter targets they can bag			0
at least , we 're pretty sure it was a joke			0
perhaps not surprisingly , @entity2 does n't directly address its drones becoming high - tech clay pigeons in a statement about safety			1
" the @entity47 is actively working on rules and an approach for unmanned aerial vehicles that will prioritize public safety			1
safety will be our top priority , and our vehicles will be built with multiple redundancies and designed to commercial aviation standards , " the statement reads			1
but @entity31 says it 's a real issue			0
" it 's not just people who hate drones , " she said			0
" it 's people who want those packages			1
" she speculated the drones will need to fly at an altitude of at least 300 feet for as long as possible to avoid attracting pot shots from target shooters or thieves			0
she also envisions safe " drop spots , " at least at first , instead of delivery to any address within range			0
" there are lots of details that need to be worked out , but nothing that is technologically overwhelming , " she said			0
will the drones work when the weather is bad ? @entity2 's official statement does n't address this obvious question			2
but @entity31 says that to make the drones reliable in most weather conditions , @entity2 would need to improve on currently available technology			2
" they can fly in some precipitation , but certainly not heavy precipitation , " she said			0
" @entity156 or snow ... would obscure some of the sensors			0
it 's hard to make it a really solid business if the weather holds you back			2
they 're going to have to work on that			0
" what could come next ? @entity2 is n't the only company at least toying with the idea of using unmanned aerial vehicles for commercial purposes			1
@entity171 's posted video of the " @entity173 " delivering two pizzas in the @entity175 earlier this year			2
in june , the @entity176 , the creation of a couple of engineers from @entity180 , demoed its ability to fly that tasty treat to your doorstep as well			0
and in @entity185 , @entity186 , a textbook company , is already using drones for deliveries			2
@entity31 hopes that 's all just the beginning			0
using drones for beneficial civic or commercial purposes , instead of military actions , is a growing trend			0
" medical supplies , wildlife monitoring , cargo , firefighting -- it 's a pretty long list of things that drones can do , " she said			0
" it 's reinvigorating a dying aerospace industry			0

@entity23 would use unmanned flying vehicles for delivering packages
ceo @entity1 says drone deliveries are at least a few years away
drone expert thinks approval will be easier outside the @entity58
weather , safety and battery life all will have to be addressed
