@entity0 -- the owner of the stricken nuclear power complex in northeastern @entity4 said saturday that it will hike the radiation exposure limit for its workers at the plant from 100 millisieverts per shift to 150 millisieverts , @entity4 's public broadcaster @entity11 reported			1
@entity12 said some workers at the @entity15 plant have already been exposed to more than 100 millisieverts and that the company , citing the unprecedented nature of the crisis , has raised the limit to 150 millisieverts for some outdoor workers			1
" this is a considerable amount of radiation , " said @entity23 , a medical physicist and professor of radiology at the @entity26			1
" the limit for radiation workers in the @entity31 is 50 millisieverts per year , but we try to keep them to less than 5 millisieverts per year			1
" @entity12 said it is doing all it can to protect workers ' health and that it will not return to the plant any worker already exposed to more than 100 millisieverts			1
@entity4 's @entity38 said friday that several hundred workers , including @entity41 employees , remained on site			2
after a single acute exposure of 1,000 millisieverts , people tend to start feeling nauseated and vomiting , @entity23 said			1
at 5,000 millisieverts over the course of a few hours , " people start dying			1
" after exposure to 150 millisieverts per day , " you 're definitely in the range where you have significantly increased risk of radiation - induced cancers			1
" for work involving recovery and restoration in an emergency operation , the @entity52 recommends no more than 50 millisieverts in any given year			1
but in cases where the lives of a great number of people may be at stake , the @entity52 says it recommends no restriction on dose as long as " the benefit to others clearly outweighs the rescuer 's risk			2
" @entity12 managing director @entity72 , upon leaving a news conference friday in @entity15 at which worker exposure levels were discussed , burst into tears			1
the announcement came a day after the country 's nuclear safety agency adjusted its assessment of the disaster			1
@entity38 raised its rating for the most serious issues from 4 to 5 -- putting those problems on par with those in the 1979 incident at @entity86 's @entity85			1
@entity12 president @entity87 said friday in a written statement that he was taking " very seriously " the increase in level of seriousness			1
" we sincerely apologize to all the people living in the surrounding area of the power station and people in @entity97 , as well as to the people of society for causing such great concern and nuisance , " he said			2
according to the @entity103 , a level 5 indicates the likelihood of a release of radioactive material , several deaths from radiation and severe damage to a reactor core			1
each step on the scale indicates an increase of 10 times the severity of the step below it , the @entity111 says			2
the chernobyl nuclear accident in the @entity119 rated a 7 , the highest level on the scale , while @entity4 's other nuclear crisis -- a 1999 accident at @entity124 in which workers died after being exposed to radiation -- rated a 4			1
the partial meltdown of a reactor core at @entity85 was deemed the worst nuclear accident in @entity31 history			2
but the rating change was not due to new problems at the plant , said @entity134 , deputy head of the nuclear safety agency			1
in fact , the situation at the plant -- while still serious -- did not worsen friday for the second consecutive day , according to the @entity111			0
the change instead came after engineers reviewed images showing damage to fuel rods and other structures inside the reactor buildings , @entity134 said			0
despite the more serious assessment , no expansion of the 20 - kilometer ( 12.4 - mile ) evacuation zone was necessary , @entity134 said friday at a briefing			0
earlier evacuation orders took into account the possibility of greater damage to the plant , he said			0
@entity111 director general @entity155 cautioned against reading too much into the raised disaster assessment			2
he said it 's too early to compare the plant 's situation to @entity85 , and he said the disaster unfolding at @entity15 is not like what happened at @entity162			0
but @entity163 , a member of the @entity164 when the @entity85 incident occurred , said @entity15 is worse than @entity85			0
" in terms of severity , this accident left @entity85 in the rear - view mirror several days ago , " he said			0
@entity155 also appeared to defend @entity4 's evacuation response , saying that @entity111 guidelines call for exactly what @entity4 has ordered -- an evacuation radius of 20 kilometers in the event of a reactor meltdown and a suggestion that people 20 kilometers to 30 kilometers stay inside			0
@entity31 officials have urged @entity31 to evacuate to a radius of 50 miles			0
the level 5 rating applies to the plant 's no. 2 and no. 3 reactors			0
the @entity4 nuclear agency assigned a rating of 3 to the problems with the used storage pool at the no. 4 reactor			1
that 's the spent - fuel pool that a @entity31 nuclear official on wednesday said had run dry , dangerously exposing fuel to the air			1
@entity12 reported friday that " we have confirmed that the water level of the pool is secured			1
" the decision to raise the level was announced as @entity4 authorities came under fire friday over the lack of timely information on the unfolding disaster			0
people near the plant , which is 240 kilometers ( 150 miles ) north of @entity0 , have expressed frustration over the lack of information from authorities , an official with a city government near the plant said			1
" evacuees , and that can be said of myself as well , are feeling anxious since we are not getting the needed information from the government in a timely manner , " said @entity208 , a spokesman for the government of @entity210 , about 20 kilometers from the nuclear facility			2
work at the plant friday focused on restoring electricity and trying to fill the spent - fuel storage pool at the no. 3 reactor			0
soldiers and utility employees sprayed about 50 tons of water from seven fire trucks into the no. 3 reactor building in an effort to refill the pool there , @entity230 reported			0
it was unclear how effective the effort was , said chief cabinet secretary @entity233			0
" we observed vapor after the water was ( shot in ) , so we believe that water did reach the pool , for sure , " he said			0
the storage pool at the no. 4 reactor also remains a concern , @entity241 , special assistant to the @entity111 director , told reporters friday			0
but efforts to cool three damaged reactors with sea water appeared to be working , @entity241 said			0
despite damage to the nuclear core at each reactor , each appeared relatively stable , the @entity111 reported			2
of the plant 's other three reactors , one had no fuel in it and two were being cooled by emergency generators that crews got working on friday , the @entity111 said			0
they were helping restore water to the reactors ' spent - fuel ponds and lower the reactors ' temperature , the agency reported			2
the effort to restore offsite power to the site also continued			0
officials had hoped to have power to part of the plant restored by friday , but the work was progressing slower than expected , they said			0
@entity4 officials have studied a plan to dump tons of sand and concrete on the plant to encase it , putting out any fires and preventing further radiation from escaping , @entity134 said			2
but he said they have ruled out such a course as " not a realistic option " and will focus instead on restoring power and cooling fuel			0
significant amounts of radiation were released after the 9.0 - magnitude earthquake on march 11 was followed by a tsunami that knocked out the plant 's backup power generators			2
radiation levels thursday hit 20 millisieverts per hour at an annex building where workers have been trying to re-establish electrical power , " the highest registered ( at that building ) so far , " a @entity12 official told reporters			1
by comparison , the typical resident of a developed country is naturally exposed to 3 millisieverts per year			2
the company said friday afternoon , though , that radiation levels at the plant 's west gate , at 0.26 to 0.27 millisieverts , had been fairly stable over the prior 12 hours			1
as of friday , monitoring of radiation levels at 47 sites across @entity4 showed minor increases in radiation , but at doses that are " far from levels which would require action , " @entity241 said			1
an initial sampling of the air in @entity0 by @entity111 monitors on friday found no evidence of radioactive materials there , @entity241 said			0
a second sampling was scheduled for saturday			0
@entity1 's @entity319 , @entity320 and @entity321 contributed to this report .			0

new : limit raised from 100 millisieverts to 150 millisieverts
@entity12 president apologizes
