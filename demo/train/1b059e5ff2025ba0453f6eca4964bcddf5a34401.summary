-- the @entity1 approved a new prescription diet drug called @entity3 on tuesday			1
the medication produced dramatic weight loss in clinical trials , but some are concerned over potential side effects , including increased heart rate , birth defects and other issues			1
@entity3 ( pronounced kyoo - @entity12 - uh ) is the second diet drug approved this year			1
the @entity1 approved a weight - loss pill called @entity15 on june 27			2
@entity3 had been known as @entity3 until its approval			2
the @entity1 asked the company to change the name to avoid confusion with another drug on the market , according to the company			0
patients in clinical trials experienced more dramatic weight loss with @entity3 than with @entity15			2
on @entity3 , patients went from an average 227 pounds to 204 pounds ; on @entity15 , the average weight dropped from 220 to 207			2
some consumer advocates worry that the weight loss comes with a price			0
some patients in the clinical trial suffered an increased heart rate and a condition called metabolic acidosis , which can lead to hyperventilation , fatigue and anorexia			1
concerns have also been raised about birth defects			1
one of the ingredients in @entity3 is topiramate , an anti-convulsant that has been linked to birth defects such as cleft lip and cleft palate in babies born to women who have taken it for migraines or seizures			1
@entity3 's other ingredient is phentermine , an appetite suppressant			2
" our belief is that women will be invited to compelling advertising and marketing messages to experiment on themselves with a drug that has some effectiveness with healthy weight loss but possible serious risks , " said @entity55 , executive director of the @entity56			0
@entity3 's manufacturer , @entity65 , says that the drug helped lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels in obese people and that people taking it were less likely to get type 2 diabetes			1
not enough good data to back obesity drug , panel says " obesity is not being adequately addressed by diet and lifestyle changes or currently available therapies , " the company said			2
" the need for new options is urgent , particularly nonsurgical options			0
" the @entity1 approved @entity3 only for obese people or for overweight people with a body mass index greater than 27 who also suffer from weight - related conditions like hypertension and diabetes			2
doctors are free to prescribe the drug to anyone , however , and there are concerns that physicians will open " pill mills " and prescribe @entity3 to people who just want to lose a few pounds			1
that 's what happened in the 1990s with fen - phen , another diet drug combination that includes phentermine			1
an @entity1 advisory committee voted against @entity3 's approval in 2010			2
the panel recommended the drug 's approval with a 20 - 2 vote in february , after @entity65 proposed a risk management program to limit @entity3 's distribution and published additional results from one of its three clinical trials			1
@entity65 will at first offer the pill only through mail order , so doctors ca n't sell it directly , said dr. @entity116 , @entity65 ' vice president of scientific communications and risk management			0
" there will not be dispensing from doctors ' offices , " she said			0
" seeing that issue and what has happened in fad and diet drugs in the past , that is not a path that we 're going to be taking			0
" the 4,430 overweight and obese patients in the @entity3 studies experienced various levels of weight loss			2
about half of patients on the recommended dose lost 10 % of their weight , while four - fifths lost 5 %			0
that amounts to about 12 pounds for a 227 - pound person			0
@entity139 , one of the patients , started out at 230 pounds and lost 48 pounds her first year on the drug and another two pounds the second year			0
" i loved it , " she said			0
" i was n't hungry			0
i almost had to remind myself to eat			0
" at 5 feet 9 inches tall , @entity143 , now 63 , describes herself as having been " @entity146 - like " in college , weighing 120 pounds			0
then she gained weight after having four children			0
an avid cook and eater , she said the drug made it easier to resist tempting foods			0
@entity1 advisers recommend diet drug " if i saw a chocolate chip cookie , it was easy enough for me to say , ' i 'm not really hungry			1
i can pass on it , ' " @entity143 said			0
she said the weight came off gradually , about four pounds a month , and her blood pressure went down almost immediately			0
despite the pill 's apparent ability to help people lose weight , some critics expressed concerns because of the possible side effects			1
" i believe that if the public were to ' buy ' ( @entity3 ) after @entity1 approval , it would run the risk of severe , even fatal , consequences from another diet lemon , " dr. @entity168 writes in @entity169 , also noting that the drug led to a slight increase in heart rates			1
in february , @entity168 was one of two @entity1 advisory committee members who voted against @entity3 's approval			2
the @entity1 and @entity65 both acknowledge that the three clinical trials meant to measure @entity3 's safety and effectiveness were not designed to properly assess cardiovascular risk			1
the @entity1 has required @entity65 to do a study on the drug 's cardiovascular effects			1
@entity65 said it would be done after the drug 's approval			1
despite the label 's warning that women of childbearing age should use birth control while on @entity3 , there are concerns that women will still get pregnant while on the drug			1
the @entity1 recommends a pregnancy test every month while on @entity3			2
in the drug - maker 's two - year clinical trial , 34 women on @entity3 became pregnant , even though they were told repeatedly to use contraception			1
no birth defects happened in those pregnancies , according to the company			1
previous clinical trials of topiramate , one of the ingredients in @entity3 , have shown a risk of about five birth defects for every 1,000 pregnancies			1
comparing the anti-obesity drug to treatments for other chronic diseases , @entity116 said patients will probably need to continue taking @entity3 long - term , though the new drug is not expected to be widely covered by health insurance plans			2
@entity1 rejects another obesity drug @entity143 , the patient who lost 50 pounds on the drug , said she has gained back about 20 pounds since the clinical trial ended two years ago and looks forward to going on @entity3 once it 's approved , even though it can have side effects			1
" there are side effects to everything , " she said			1
she added that the drug was n't the only reason she lost weight			0
weekly counseling on nutrition and exercise were a big factor , too			0
the counselor helped her change her diet -- choosing a salad for lunch instead of a burger , forgoing pasta and potatoes at dinner -- and encouraged her to walk a few times a week in addition to her regular exercise as goalie in a women 's soccer league			0
" before the medicine , i had been telling the girls they 'd have to find a new goalie , because i could n't dive for the ball like i did before , " she said			0
" then i lost the weight , and i was diving and bouncing back up and having a great old time again			0

@entity3 , formerly known as @entity3 , is second diet drug approved since june
drug 's side effects in clinical trial included increased heart rate
concerns have also been raised about the risk of birth defects
