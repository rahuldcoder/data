-- @entity1 helped @entity2 bounce back from @entity4 heartache as he came off the bench to score twice against @entity6 on sunday and edge the @entity8 club closer to the @entity10 title			1
the four - time world player of the year was an unused substitute in the 3 - 0 defeat by @entity13 in wednesday 's second leg of the semifinal at the @entity16 , apparently not yet recovered from his hamstring problem			0
but he made an instant impact after coming on just before the hour mark against @entity6 , as @entity21 was the man to make way straight after leveling the score at 2 - 2			1
the @entity24 star curled in a superb free - kick on 59 , then hit the crossbar with another set - piece before -- in the 70th minute -- finishing off a low cross from @entity29 , who had been put in space on the right by an exquisite backheel from @entity33			0
it put @entity2 11 points clear of second - placed defending champions @entity36 with four games to play , meaning victory at third - placed @entity39 next sunday will be enough to seal a 22nd domestic crown			1
@entity1 has now scored 60 goals this season , 46 of them in @entity44 -- where he has found the net in his past 21 appearances			1
@entity2 had made the worst possible start as seventh - placed @entity6 took the lead in under two minutes through @entity50 striker @entity49 , who scored his sixth goal since joining on loan in january			2
@entity29 equalized inside 10 minutes , heading his ninth league goal this season from @entity33 's cross , and @entity2 almost took the lead just before halftime when @entity57 smashed a shot against the underside of the bar -- the ball appeared to hit the line before bouncing to safety			2
however , @entity6 hit back with an even better effort as midfielder @entity65 -- on loan from @entity39 -- fired in a piledriver from long range to give his side the lead at the interval			0
that lasted until the 55th minute , when @entity73 found space at the far post to nod in @entity77 ' right - wing cross before @entity1 took over			0
@entity78 moved up to eighth place with a 3 - 0 win over @entity81 that further dented the @entity2 - based side 's faint hopes of @entity85 qualification			2
@entity86 moved out of the bottom three with a 3 - 0 win that left @entity88 behind @entity78 on goal difference , while bottom club @entity90 drew 1 - 1 with midtable @entity91 .			0

@entity2 two points away from league title after sunday 's 4 - 2 win over @entity6
@entity1 scores twice after @entity2 twice come from behind at @entity16
@entity1 takes his tally to 60 goals this season , 46 of them in @entity44
@entity2 can wrap up 22nd league title with win over @entity39 next sunday
