@entity0 , @entity1 -- on monday morning , the sirens went off in @entity0 , warning of an incoming rocket from @entity5			1
i was asleep and in that foggy state of mind made the mental calculation not to get out of bed and seek shelter , despite the blaring red alert			1
this happens so often on @entity1 's side of the @entity5 border that sirens are just another part of your day and it 's easy to become complacent			1
seconds later , a distant boom			1
i 've only been here for little more than a week , but i 'm already falling into this strange routine			1
the beach in front of my hotel here is gorgeous : blue water , kids playing in the surf while their parents soak up the sun. in the quiet moments , it 's hard to believe there 's a war going on less than a 20 - minute drive away			1
but then another siren will go off			1
some people quickly walk to shelters			2
most rockets fall into open areas or get intercepted by @entity1 's @entity45 anti-missile system			2
the rockets from @entity5 are wildly inaccurate , but the rare direct hit can be deadly			1
when i talk to residents , they often try to describe this distant but constant threat , more psychological than physical			1
being driven to madness by rocket fire is a common problem here			1
inside a @entity56 tunnel support for the @entity1 operation few believe any form of negotiation will work , and nobody is shy about telling you what they think			1
many not only believe the @entity5 offensive is justified but want the @entity66 to escalate the operation , to demolish @entity56 and its rockets once and for all			1
two recent polls in @entity1 showed more than 80 % of respondents rejected a cease - fire as long as rocket attacks continued and the tunnel network in @entity5 remained , even while supporting the continuation of @entity75 until @entity56 is overthrown			1
on the roads , blue and white banners flap their support for @entity66 soldiers			2
tour buses of civilians come to hand out ice cream and care packages to resting soldiers , stuffed with socks and underwear , favorite snacks and sweets			2
@entity90 caravans are parked alongside the highway to offer spiritual support			2
one man at a gas station offered me this unsolicited metaphor on dealing with @entity5 and @entity56 : " when your child is young , you can beat him when he does something wrong			1
but when he is older , then it 's too late			2
beating him will do nothing			2
" i was left wondering what " more " could be and whether violence could end the threat forever			2
every day , the casualty count in @entity5 rises			1
it 's now more than 1,000 dead and thousands more wounded			2
the vast majority are @entity109 civilians caught in the relentless shelling of their neighborhoods			2
people here are aware of the pain and suffering the @entity1 military has inflicted			2
most i spoke to do n't take any joy in it			2
there is , instead , a grim determination to get the job done , however brutal			2
one kibbutz member told us he had been hoping to host a family exchange , allowing members of a @entity109 family in @entity5 to live in an @entity1 home for a while , to start a dialogue			1
but then the war happened			2
a group of @entity56 militants managed to burrow under the border and infiltrate only a few hundred meters from his home			1
an @entity66 patrol engaged the militants , killing most of them , but he and his wife spent that night in their safe room , listening to the deafening sounds of battle outside			2
he still wants dialogue but , unsurprisingly , only after the @entity66 has dismantled the tunnel network that came so close to his home			2
big reminders of war during the day , we drive down the 232 border highway and see a country mobilized for war			1
merkava tanks kick up dust rumbling alongside the road			0
armored personnel carriers are transported by trucks			0
giant armored bulldozers wait for orders			0
usually , we get off the highway and drive through the sunflower and melon fields to catch sight of a military unit or artillery position			1
last week , we happened upon a unit nestled in a green orange grove , just a few hundred meters from the @entity5 border			1
they had just pulled out of @entity5			1
our cameraman shot video of the tanks returning from the border and the troops relaxing in the setting sun. it was strangely peaceful			1
overhead , planes and helicopters dropped flares and we counted the booming pattern of artillery fire and wondered where the shells were falling on the other side			1
the soldiers next to us did not look victorious in any way			0
they just looked exhausted and dusty			0
more than 40 @entity1 soldiers have been killed so far			0
this is the biggest loss the @entity1 military has suffered since its 2006 war in @entity190			0
but it has not diminished the appetite for war and may even strengthen @entity1 's resolve			0
i was struck by how one military family , whose eldest son was killed in an ambush in @entity5 , spoke through their grief to describe the righteousness of their cause , a conviction that blends fervent nationalism and religious devotion			1
" the @entity208 people are the most moral people			0
those people on the other side are the ones without morals , " the father told me			0
and when i asked about the possibility of peace , he just laughed : " who are you going to make peace with ? @entity56 ? we gave @entity5 back to them 10 years ago			1
and who is sitting there now ? not the good people			0
" ' we came here to see it with our own eyes ' in the evenings , we set up our live shot location near the @entity5 border to see the skies light up with flares and feel the ground shake with the sound of outgoing artillery			1
we are n't the only ones			0
plenty of residents from nearby towns come to watch : teenage girls in summer dresses			1
men with barbeques and shisha pipes			0
professional journalists and amateur photographers with cameras and microphones in hand			0
sometimes the crowd is rowdy , angry			0
one night , a group of men cheered the bombing on , whooping whenever a shell landed			0
they were not fans of @entity2			0
and when they found out who we were , they threatened our engineer and grabbed our camera			0
but that 's not always the case			0
one night , a group of @entity264 watched the surreal light show next to a group of former and serving soldiers			0
the mood was somber , subdued			0
the soldiers did not want to talk			0
they watched the scene with grim intent			0
" we came here to see it with our own eyes , " explains one of the @entity274 men , " they are our brothers , @entity264 like us			0
it hurts us to know that they suffer like this , especially during @entity282			0
" monday is actually the end of @entity282 , leading to @entity284			0
and when i got up monday morning , after the siren sounded , there was a faint hope of de-escalation on this holiday			0
overnight , the rocket attacks had subsided somewhat and there was only the occasional @entity66 strike			1
by late afternoon , the lull in fighting had disappeared : a rocket barrage from @entity5 , then @entity1 airstrikes			1
and even as i type this , another siren blares and i can see the children on the beach flatten themselves in the sand or sprint for shelter			0
the boom sounds in the distance			0
and , then , life here resumes as normal as can be under the circumstances			0
but somewhere in @entity5 , the military 's response is swift and devastating and i can not help but wonder how many more will die today			1
@entity311 knows no holiday .			0

in @entity0 , rocket attack sirens go off so often , the sound is just another part of the day
few in the city say negotiation will work , and many think the @entity5 offensive is justified
in the evenings , residents *gather* near the @entity5 border to see flares , feel outgoing artillery
