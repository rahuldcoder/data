-- @entity1 showed off a host of visual and search enhancements to its search engine @entity5 , in hopes that better packaging will help it eat away at @entity9 's online dominance			1
" we are neck - to - neck in terms of search quality , " said @entity5 head @entity10			1
" why would an end user , if you are neck to neck on search quality , use @entity5 ? that 's the question we ask ourselves every day			1
" the answer the company is betting is a combination of a prettier interface , results informed by what your friends think , and focussing on helping people do things faster , whether that 's finding a product review or buying an airline ticket			0
wednesday 's announcements includes a new mobile app for @entity37 and the @entity38 , that brings some of the design feel of @entity40 to their competitors ' devices , along with some nifty maps , real time bus directions , and an easy way to make beautiful panoramas			0
you can also easily make reservations via @entity49 and take a virtual tour of a restaurant 's interior when a restaurant shows up in map search results			2
@entity1 also redesigned its browser - based image search and maps , reducing the latter 's reliance on the @entity60 plug - in and instead doing more with the power of modern browsers and @entity63			1
traditional search also got a slight makeover , with visual changes being made to how results are returned for musical artists , destinations and movies , among other types of search			0
one particularly good new search result that @entity1 demoed , but which is not yet live , is for movies that are no longer playing in theaters			2
the movie page for that movie will , like those for in - theater movies , show you a preview and links to reviews			0
but it substitutes direct , deep links to places to watch the movie online , including @entity88 , for the typical showtime listings			0
@entity5 now has 11.8 % of the @entity91 search market , a 48 % hump growth since @entity5 replaced live search in the summer of 2009 , according to @entity94			2
but even better , he said , is that @entity5 is now gaining adherents , particularly younger users , who like its visual emphasis , use the site regularly and perhaps , most importantly , recommend it to other people			2
wired : picture this -- @entity9 chases @entity103 certainly , its rival @entity9 has taken notice of @entity5 's visual splashiness -- and even disastrously tried to imitate the background images on its famously sparse search home page , only to cut short the trial within hours			1
@entity9 also revamped its image search earlier this year , clearly imitating @entity103 's innovations			1
while @entity9 's visual search technology still trumps @entity103 's when it comes to identifying images , @entity5 's new @entity113 makes it very easy to browse through large images , not just thumbnails			1
perhaps most importantly , @entity103 now has a partnership with @entity119 , and one out of five @entity5 users are candidates for " instant personalization , " since they are logged into @entity119 and have n't chosen to opt - out			2
what that meant for searchers when the partnership launched in october was n't much			0
for instance , if you search for " how to quiet a baby " and one of your friends on @entity119 has liked one of the articles that shows up in the search results , you will see their picture next to that result			0
but now @entity5 is going further			0
when you search for say " @entity136 " , @entity5 actually looks into what your friends are interested in , finds stories they have liked via little " like " buttons all over the net , and then inserts that into the top results -- even if that story would n't have shown up in @entity5 's natural search results			1
wired : @entity145 adds @entity103 to list of search engines that could turn into a huge advantage for @entity5 , if over time there is enough information in social networking profiles to really make search better			0
" even if only a small percentage of queries have moments where the social graph informs and improves search results , it 's a huge difference , " @entity10 said , adding that it is only the beginning of using social sites like @entity119 to improve search			2
@entity119 , which sees @entity9 as its biggest rival , is unlikely to share its core user data with @entity9 , which itself is at work on a social add - on to its services			0
overall , @entity1 's emphasis on finding new ways to group information and make doing things easier seems to be stealing a page from its old rival @entity173			0
since @entity9 's design sense heavily relies on minimalism , that leaves lots of room for @entity1 ( and its search partner @entity181 ) to experiment with alternative , graphics - heavy designs			1
being in second place also lets @entity1 play with new visual approaches to search faster than @entity9 can , as there are fewer users who will get upset when the location of a link moves			1
wired : @entity5 will add video , animation to homepage @entity1 did n't announce anything today on par with @entity9 's recent announcement of " @entity197 , " a huge engineering feat that lets users see search results before even finishing typing their query			1
but @entity1 showed today they are still in the lucrative search game , even if they are n't making money at it yet , and if you have n't used @entity5 in recent months , it 's definitely worth giving it another test spin			1
