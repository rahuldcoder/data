@entity0 , @entity1 -- every year , we hear stories of global warming advancing and the effects that has on the earth 's climate patterns			1
one phenomenon that is often used to illustrate ice melt in the @entity11 is giant icebergs , often the size of whole towns or even small countries , breaking off the ice shield and drifting south			0
in reality , icebergs constantly break off both the arctic ice shield and @entity1 's inland glaciers , a process that scientists call calving			1
to find out whether that process is accelerating a @entity2 crew traveled to southern @entity1 , to the small village @entity0 , where the @entity27 ( @entity27 ) keep a unique unit of experts			1
they are called the @entity31 and the unit consists of ship navigators and pilots who fly across the south of this vast island to monitor the movement of icebergs , to prevent collisions with cargo ships navigating in the waters around @entity1			1
" we keep an eye out for icebergs that are bunched together in narrow waterways , " said ice observer @entity43 on an airborne mission around the southern tip of @entity1			1
while big icebergs can pose a threat to vessels going through here , surprisingly it is smaller ice pieces that are even more dangerous			2
" the smaller icebergs are much harder to detect , " @entity57 said as she was surveying the ice with her binoculars , " especially if the icebergs have been traveling in the water a long time they become almost colorless and nearly invisible in the ocean			2
" flying over the majestic landscapes of this part of @entity1 , observers see a huge amount of icebergs , some almost the size of aircraft carriers and several stories tall , others shaped in a distinctive blue coloring because the air has been pressed out of the ice in its glacial journey			1
some experts believe that the glaciers in @entity1 are calving at a higher rate as temperatures rise , but the ice observers say their observations are not long term enough to speak of a general trend			1
" in the past two years there have been more icebergs here , " @entity57 says , " but then again in the years before there were a lot fewer so it really varies from year to years			0
" however , other observers point to the fact that @entity1 's glaciers have been receding for years , pointing to increased ice melt in the polar region			1
but even on fairly clear days it takes an experienced captain to navigate a ship through the waters around @entity1			0
@entity57 is also an officer on the @entity102 , @entity1 's own shipping company and says it takes years to understand the challenges involved sailing in @entity1			2
" when you encounter masses of icebergs you can either try and go through it or you can go around it , " @entity57 said			0
" in most cases the captain will usually try and go around it if he can because no matter how slow you go and how careful you are there will always be damage to the ship and then the weather can get much worse very quickly and you do n't want to be in a field of icebergs if it does			0
" her experience as a ship 's navigator make her so valuable as an ice observer for the @entity27 , but the everyone in the crew needs to be at the top of their game			2
@entity131 pilots the helicopter through the fjords and hills in this extremely rugged terrain			0
a difficult task as he often deals with severe weather while having to make the ride smooth enough for the observers to do their job			0
" yeah , there are some pretty heavy and gusty winds here , " @entity131 said shortly after landing at a @entity142 weather outpost right at the southern tip of @entity1			2
" the other thing is that the weather changes so quickly here , you always have to call ahead to all the airfields and weather stations and keep yourself updated			0
otherwise you can be in severe weather in no time			0
" the observers fly missions three times a week if the weather permits			1
afterward they file reports on the location of dangerous ice clusters with photos that show vessels what they are in four if they try to get through			1
the @entity31 's reports are vital and may have already saved lives			2
the unit was founded after a ship sank off the coast of @entity1 in 1959 , killing all crew and passengers on board			1
the @entity173 disaster is known as the " @entity174 " in this part of the world			0
@entity177 , the chief ice observer during @entity2 's stay with the unit said : " just like the @entity174 , it was her maiden voyage			1
to this day we do n't know exactly what happened , but we do know that she hit an ice berg and sank with all souls on board			0
she did manage to send an sos and later some rescue equipment was recovered			0
" there has n't been a major incident in the waters off @entity1 since the ice patrol was founded			2
better satellite images and more advanced ships will also have played a role in this improved track record , but there is no doubt that captains navigating the cold and often treacherous water of the @entity11 value the detailed and up to date information the observers provide .			0

@entity2 's @entity208 joins @entity142 *meteorologists* as they chart the passage of @entity1 icebergs
more icebergs have been observed in recent years but experts *unsure* of long - term trend
observers fly missions three times a week before filing reports on dangerous ice
@entity31 founded after " @entity174 " sank off the island 's coast in 1959 killing all crew and passengers
