-- @entity1 marches forward to the next @entity3 primary battle with wins in @entity5 and @entity6 , throwing cold water on rival @entity9 's prediction that his campaign was reaching a " desperate end			1
" @entity9 , rejected again by @entity14 conservatives in the tuesday primaries , was battling for second place with @entity17			1
the latter had staked his campaign on a @entity14 strategy after winning @entity20 and @entity21			0
in @entity5 , @entity1 won 35 % of the vote			1
@entity23 and @entity9 both had 29 % -- although @entity23 was about 2,000 votes ahead with 99 % of the vote counted -- and @entity25 had 5 %			0
with 99 % of the vote counted in @entity6 , @entity1 had 33 %			2
@entity23 was at 31 % , @entity9 at 30 % and @entity25 at 4 %			0
in another of tuesday 's races , @entity9 claimed victory in the caucuses of @entity30 , picking up the @entity33 territory 's nine delegates , according to local party officials			2
@entity0 also projects he will win the @entity36 caucuses			2
@entity30 territories play a significant part in the @entity3 presidential race in march			0
last saturday , @entity9 won caucuses in @entity41 and the @entity42			0
he also picked up a majority of the delegates in the @entity45			0
the next contest on the @entity3 primary calendar is @entity48 on sunday			0
" we did it again , " @entity1 told supporters tuesday night in @entity50 , @entity51 , which will hold a @entity3 primary on march 24			0
@entity1 , whose @entity5 and @entity6 victories give him 10 wins to @entity9 's 18 , poked at the frontrunner as he reiterated his stance that he is the viable conservative alternative to the former @entity63 governor			1
" people ( said ) , ' you 're being outspent ( by @entity9 ) , ' and everybody 's talking about all the ( delegate ) math , and that his race is inevitable			2
well , for someone who thinks this race is inevitable , ( @entity9 ) has spent a whole lot of money against me for being inevitable , " @entity1 told supporters			2
earlier in the day , @entity9 , who still holds a large overall delegate lead , said @entity1 's campaign was trying to resuscitate a losing effort			1
" sen. @entity1 is at the desperate end of his campaign and trying in some way to boost his prospects , " @entity9 said on @entity0 's " @entity78			1
" as news was breaking of @entity1 's win in @entity5 , @entity1 communications director @entity83 replied to @entity9 's statement , saying , " it 's just the beginning			1
" @entity1 , a former senator from @entity89 , was coming off a big win in @entity91 on saturday and has given himself a bigger boost in the battle to be the conservative alternative to @entity9 by beating @entity23 in @entity5 and @entity6 , in @entity23 's home turf in the @entity20			1
the wins are somewhat of a surprise , because polls released monday showed @entity1 running 8 to 10 points behind @entity9 and @entity23 in the two states			1
still , because @entity5 's 47 delegates and @entity6 's 37 delegates will be awarded proportionally , @entity9 appeared to maintain his delegate lead and may add to it after more moderate @entity106 's 17 delegates are distributed			1
a @entity0 delegate estimate early wednesday showed @entity9 with a 489 - 234 lead over @entity1 , giving him a 255 - delegate margin			1
the estimate had @entity23 at 139 delegates and @entity25 at 66			0
the number of delegates needed to clinch the nomination is 1,144			0
@entity23 , speaking to supporters in @entity116 , @entity5 , focused on the amount of votes that @entity9 did n't get , and said that " the elite media 's effort to convince the nation that @entity9 is inevitable just collapsed			1
" " the fact is that in both states , the conservative candidates got nearly 70 % of the vote , and if you 're the frontrunner and you keep coming in third , you 're not much of a frontrunner , " @entity23 said			0
" and frankly , i do not believe that a @entity63 moderate who created @entity129 as the forerunner of @entity131 is going to be in a position to win any debates this fall , and that is part of the reason i 've insisted in staying in this race			0
" @entity23 , who was under the most pressure to take both states , said he still had time to persuasively argue that he is the conservative who should go against president @entity142 in the fall			0
the former @entity145 speaker has won contests in @entity20 and @entity21 , which he represented in @entity147 for two decades , but has finished third or worse in most contests outside the region and campaigned intensively in @entity5 and @entity6 over the last week			2
@entity9 's campaign has been holding up its large lead in delegates as a reason for @entity23 and @entity1 to get out of the race			1
but @entity9 , who flew to @entity155 on tuesday ahead of a fundraiser and did not plan to address supporters tuesday night , would n't have turned down a win in a region dominated by social conservatives , who have been hesitant to support his candidacy			2
@entity162 , a @entity9 campaign senior adviser , said the campaign met its goal of taking roughly one - third of the @entity6 and @entity5 delegates			1
" once the dust clears , you 'll be able to look and see that there really will be no ground that our opponents have made up against @entity9 , " @entity162 said tuesday night			2
" and as you look at the upcoming contests on the calendar , there are no opportunities for them to have significant wins that allow them to accumulate large numbers of delegates so that they can close that gap with @entity9			2
" election night blog @entity183 , a @entity145 press secretary under president @entity184 , said , " there is no end in sight			0
" " i think the real impact ... tonight is that for @entity3 who thought that maybe @entity9 could come @entity20 and make this race look like it was coming to an end , this race is going on and on and on , " @entity183 , a @entity0 contributor , said			2
delegate tracker delegate calculator @entity5 exit polls exit polls from @entity5 and @entity6 show that @entity9 still has some ground to make up to win over conservatives : in @entity5 , 55 % of those polled said @entity9 's position on the issues was n't conservative enough ; in @entity6 , the number was 49 %			1
in another trend that has continued throughout the campaign , more voters saw @entity9 as the best choice for defeating @entity142 in the general election			2
in @entity5 , 46 % saw @entity9 as being the most likely to beat @entity142 , while both @entity1 and @entity23 were the favorites of 24 % ; in @entity6 , 50 % of those polled saw @entity9 as having the best chance of beating @entity142 , compared to 24 % for @entity23 and 23 % for @entity1			1
as results were coming in tuesday night , @entity0 chief political analyst @entity210 said that hardcore conservatives ' persistent preference for @entity1 or @entity23 means @entity9 benefits from the presence of both			1
" gov. @entity9 needs @entity1 and @entity17 right now			1
... if it were n't for them splitting the conservatives -- the very conservative , the evangelical , the @entity218 voters -- @entity9 would not be within sort of a position to win in either of @entity6 or @entity5			1
so the fact that they 're splitting the vote ... he ought to pay them both to stay in for a little bit longer			0
" @entity6 exit polls results of all races @entity1 and @entity9 are expected to split the next few contests on the calendar			1
@entity1 won the nonbinding primary in @entity234 in february and is expected to take the state 's caucuses on saturday			0
@entity9 is expected to win @entity48 's primary on sunday but @entity1 will now travel there to try to make it harder for @entity9			1
polls in @entity241 , which votes on tuesday , show a tight race and @entity1 is expected to win in @entity51 a week from saturday			0
then the race turns north and eastward â € ” the @entity244 , @entity245 and @entity247 vote on april 3 and @entity9 is the early favorite there			0
but that 's three weeks away and much has changed in such a span in the most volatile @entity3 race in generations			0
@entity5 results county by county map @entity6 results county by county map @entity25 , a congressman from @entity260 , did n't campaign over the past week in either @entity5 or @entity6			1
