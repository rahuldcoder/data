-- @entity1 jokes that his home is " in @entity3 in a nice , big plane			0
" the 57 - year - old car dealership consultant is a mega-frequent flier who has racked up 9.7 million miles during 5,000 flights over the past three decades -- and he 's got the stories to prove it			1
" i 've experienced aborted takeoffs , aborted landings , near misses and passenger deaths on three different flights			0
" sure , his status as frequent - flier king earns him royal treatment			1
but the @entity21 commercial airline system often leaves him stranded like millions of other travelers			1
to deal with potential gridlock from the 1 billion @entity21 air passengers expected to crowd the skies by 2021 , the @entity23 is overhauling its traffic system , which has remained largely unchanged for 30 years			1
the overhaul is called @entity30 and components of the air traffic program are already in use or being tested at airports in several @entity21 cities including @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 , @entity40			1
that 's none too soon if you ask @entity1 , who like many travelers believes the current traffic infrastructure is showing signs of stress			1
@entity1 , who lives in @entity48 and @entity49 , usually flies out of @entity51 's @entity50 and @entity54 's @entity53 airports bound for @entity55 or @entity56			1
he 's spent countless hours on airport tarmacs waiting to take off -- only to return to the gate when the flight is canceled			1
" when i 'm sitting in first class , i ca n't complain , " he said			0
but what really frustrates @entity1 are flights that fail to arrive on time			0
" it 's the missing of connections which is so screwed up , " said @entity1			1
" the airline on - time ratings are so low -- even since 9/11 when air traffic went down			1
" in fact , from 1990 to 2008 , the national average for all delayed flights increased from 41 minutes to an hour , according to the @entity72			0
millions of consumers are so frustrated with the airline experience that they 're avoiding it , and delays are part of the problem			0
some 41 million potential fliers chose not to travel by air from may 2007 to may 2008 , according to @entity82 of the @entity83			1
that translates into $ 26.5 billion in lost spending that could have boosted a recession - dogged economy			0
" the result is less travel , less spending , fewer @entity21 jobs , " he said			0
but as the nation emerges from recession , air passenger traffic will explode , say experts			1
the @entity30 overhaul is so complicated and massive that it 's often compared to the space race of the 1960s			1
it will take until at least 2025 to complete and will have an estimated total price of $ 22 billion			0
however , long delays and additional costs are threatening to add hundreds of millions of dollars to the project , according to the @entity105			0
when it 's done , technology and communication improvements in aircraft and at airports promise to save consumers time , money and headaches			1
a major pillar of @entity30 involves tracking aircraft			1
currently , aircraft are tracked by radar , a technology that dates to before @entity119 @entity30 aims to switch its tracking system to a technology that millions of travelers have had in their pockets for years : global satellite positioning , or gps			1
tracking aircraft by satellite is more accurate than radar			1
currently , planes must fly zig - zag routes to stay close to ground - based radar tracking stations			1
with gps technology called @entity133 ( automatic dependent surveillance - broadcast ) , planes can be tracked while flying in straight - line routes			0
they save thousands of hours of travel time , millions of gallons of fuel and millions of dollars			0
" there are some estimates that flights could be 10 % to 20 % shorter in the short distances and a few percent better in the long distances , " said air industry consultant @entity141 of @entity142			2
shorter routes use less fuel , which could cut airline costs			2
" it could eventually bring down airfares , but not until the entire system is upgraded , " @entity141 said			1
@entity154 has been using the technology about a year and expects to save $ 60 million in annual fuel costs by 2020 , when @entity133 is mandated for use nationwide			2
@entity158 has been using gps - based @entity30 technology since the mid- ' 90s to enable planes to fly safely through mountainous terrain in low visibility weather			0
this technology , called @entity165 , allowed @entity158 to avoid canceling low - visibility flights , saving it $ 15.8 million last year			2
on the ground , @entity30 calls for new cooperative systems between airports , traffic controllers and airlines			0
airlines sharing precise information about where their flights are on the tarmac and exactly when aircraft are expected to depart their gates can save up to 4Â½ minutes per flight in delays , said @entity181 , the @entity23 's top @entity30 official			1
travelers may have more flights to choose from on certain routes because of @entity30			0
more accurate tracking with gps technology ultimately would allow more aircraft to follow each other safely at closer range			2
" but we 're not just going to throw capacity where it does n't make sense , " warns the @entity195 's @entity194			2
" we will be much more able to respond to that consumer demand			0
" this all sounds like good news to a frequent flier like @entity1 , but he knows dealing with congestion wo n't solve the whole problem			2
" whether a person travels once a year or 300 times a year , it will make their ongoing travel more seamless , " @entity1 speculated			2
" but you 've still got the problems on the ground			0
you 've still got the actual boarding of the plane and getting in line -- i mean , that 's where the frustration comes from , you know ? " @entity1 admitted he does n't spend much time waiting in line these days , thanks to his mega-frequent flier status			1
when facing a tricky connection , he 's greeted at the terminal by helpful golf - cart drivers who whisk him to his next flight			1
if the connection is really tight , the airline will actually escort @entity1 directly from the plane to the tarmac where a vehicle will drive him to his next gate			0
" they treat me like i own the airport , " he said			0
but @entity1 is quick to remind himself that he 's not too disconnected from his coach - class traveler days			2
increased capacity and demand could affect even him			0
airports say they 're watching developments carefully			0
officials at the nation 's busiest airport , @entity242 's @entity242 , do n't know when the @entity23 plans to unveil @entity30 there			1
but they do n't expect to see it reduce aircraft delays for many years			2
takeoffs and landings at @entity21 airports are expected to top 69 million in 20 years			2
@entity1 said he expects to cross the 10 - million - mile mark sometime in august			2
when @entity30 takes hold , he 'll still be dreaming of his favorite destination in the entire world : " home			0
" if @entity30 goes as planned , he 'll get there quicker and arrive on time			0
this is part one of a three - part series of stories surrounding the @entity23 's " @entity30 " overhaul of the @entity21 air traffic system			1
check back on wednesday for more on the technology involved and how it might be used in other fields			0
@entity0 's @entity263 , @entity264 and @entity265 contributed to this report .			0
