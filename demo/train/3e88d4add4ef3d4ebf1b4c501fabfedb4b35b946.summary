-- 49 years of age and still going strong , @entity1 's @entity0 delighted the @entity5 galleries to lead the @entity6 at the halfway stage friday			1
@entity0 , a real crowd favorite with his flamboyant approach both on and off the course , drew on all his experience to card a level - par 71 for three - under 139			1
a strengthening wind and fast running greens and fairways made the famous links course in @entity16 a brutal test , with only a few golfers passing a stern examination			2
among them , chasing his elusive 15th major , was @entity22 , who also carded a 71 to be in a select group on two - under , one off the lead			1
woods rolled in a confidence boosting birdie on the 18th and admitted conditions had been tough			0
" it was difficult out there today , " he told gathered reporters			0
@entity22 said patience would be the key over the weekend with conditions predicted to stay the same			1
" just continue plodding along			0
just continue being patient , putting the ball in the right spots , " he said			0
" we 're not going to get a lot of opportunities out there			0
" @entity22 has good company in the chasing group with 40 - year - old @entity45 @entity44 , who shot a joint best of the day 68 , @entity48 @entity47 and fellow @entity50 @entity49			1
overnight leader @entity51 fell away with a 75 but is still in contention in the pack at one - under - par with @entity55 's @entity54 , @entity56 of @entity1 and @entity58 veteran @entity57			1
@entity0 , who became the oldest winner on the @entity60 earlier this season , said age should not be a barrier to success on the course			1
" only the young people can do it ? i love what i 'm doing			0
i play golf for a living			0
i enjoy myself , " he told the official @entity74 @entity6 website			2
" i keep elastic and flexible			0
i 'm still able to shoot low and still here			0
tomorrow if i can not shoot low , i will not be here , you do n't worry , " he added with a smile			0
@entity50 @entity78 looked set to take closer order , but a four - putt nightmare on the 16th showed the speed of the surfaces and set him back in his tracks			1
he ended with a three - over 74 for one - over 143 , bracketed with reigning @entity85 champion @entity85 of @entity86 , former masters winners @entity87 and @entity89 , 2011 @entity6 winner @entity90 and @entity45 's @entity91			1
but there will be no back to back major wins for @entity95 as the @entity45 star missed the cut after his @entity99 heroics at the @entity100			2
former @entity102 's @entity101 and @entity103 will also not be around for the weekend despite the cut being made at seven - over - par. but defending champion @entity104 of @entity105 scraped in at six - over , along with former winners @entity106 and @entity108 .			2

49 - year - old @entity0 leads @entity6
@entity111 on 139 -- three under par -- at @entity5
@entity22 *firmly* in contention just one *adrift*
@entity78 drops back after four - putt green
