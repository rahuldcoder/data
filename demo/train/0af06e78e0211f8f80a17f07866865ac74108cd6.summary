-- the lab mishaps at the @entity2 are having " broad impacts , " compromising care for patients with diseases like tuberculosis and chikungunya and potentially slowing work overseas on @entity4 and @entity5 , according to a @entity2 official			1
multiple improprieties -- including transporting dangerous materials in @entity16 bags and sending a live sample of bird flu to a low - security lab -- prompted @entity2 director dr. @entity20 last week to instruct his highest - security labs to stop transferring out biological materials			1
the transfer moratorium means laboratories around the world can no longer depend on the @entity2 to help them diagnose unusual diseases such as drug - resistant tuberculosis , @entity30 respiratory syndrome , @entity23 spotted fever and typhus , said @entity33 , deputy director of the @entity2 's office of infectious diseases			1
" the @entity2 is one of the only places that can diagnose these diseases , " @entity33 said			2
hardest hit , health experts say , may be @entity41 patients			0
because of the transfer moratorium , some patients have been unable to find out what type of @entity41 they have			0
that means their doctors do n't know which antibiotic to prescribe , according to @entity48 , director of infectious disease programs at the @entity50			2
" the moratorium was the absolute right thing to do ; you 've got to triple - check all your procedures , " said @entity51 , executive director of the association			2
" but if this goes on for another week , we 're going to have even more problems			0
" the @entity2 is one of only three public health labs in the @entity63 that can do quick testing on drug - resistant tuberculosis specimens to see which antibiotic might work the best			1
the other two , in @entity67 and @entity68 , might be able to handle some of the overflow , @entity48 said			0
the @entity2 will also be turning away about 100 samples per week that need to be checked for chikungunya , a mosquito - borne disease that 's risen to record levels in @entity74 , the @entity75 and other parts of the @entity77 , according to @entity33			1
doctors in the area have been sending specimens to the @entity2 to help diagnose the disease , which often has the same symptoms as dengue fever or malaria			0
without answers , doctors on the ground will have difficulty knowing how to treat their patients and whether they need to isolate them from other people , @entity33 said			0
the @entity2 has also stopped a mosquito surveillance program in @entity94 states aimed at detecting whether infected bugs are bringing the disease to the continental @entity63 state labs in the @entity63 also rely on materials from the @entity2 to test substances such as white powders that are suspicious for bioterrorism			1
the labs have enough materials to last a while but at some point will run out			0
internationally , labs that are working on the @entity4 crisis in @entity108 and on @entity30 respiratory syndrome might see their work slowed down because of the @entity2 lab situation			1
those international labs depend on materials from the @entity2 to do their work			1
@entity33 said they also currently have enough but might run out soon			0
the 22 @entity2 labs under the moratorium are in @entity118 ; @entity119 ; @entity120 , @entity74 ; and @entity121 , @entity122			2
the moratorium will be removed lab by lab as each one can prove that it can operate safely again , and some of the @entity2 labs might be able to transport materials in a few days , but others might not not be fully operational for months , @entity33 said			1
" we should n't and we wo n't be doing this work unless we can do it in a safe way , " he added			0
" as soon as each lab can document that policies and procedures and validated protocols are in place , they can resume transporting materials			0

improprieties lead director to instruct labs to stop transferring out biological materials
highest - security labs can no longer send out material
the *ban* means other labs can no longer get the @entity2 's help
