-- perhaps you have done something like this at some stage in your life : you wake up late for work , hung - over , maybe still a little drunk			0
you throw on some clothes and report for duty			0
maybe you even take a little pride in having gotten your act together so fast ? hopefully you did n't snort cocaine to clear your head , and hopefully you were n't piloting a commercial airliner either			0
this is how the morning goes for captain whip @entity16 ( @entity17 ) , who copes with an angry wake - up call from his ex-wife and then has to face down a storm on takeoff			1
as the saying goes , it 's all down hill from here			1
an hour into the flight , the plane goes into a tailspin , and whip has to use his expertise to execute a death - defying emergency landing			1
he 's a national hero -- until the blood test results come in			2
with its spectacular plane crash -- i would rate it fractionally behind the air disasters director @entity37 staged in " @entity38 " and @entity39 in " @entity40 , " but still more than gut - wrenching enough to make you think about taking the train , next time -- " flight " immediately raises the stakes on your typical addiction drama			1
but that 's essentially what it is -- with a courtroom finish for extra lift			2
see , that title refers not just to one doomed trip , but also to whip 's pattern of evasion			2
in the aftermath , he steers as far as possible from public scrutiny , avoids even his own defense team , and like all addicts reserves his biggest lies for himself			0
the first thing he does when he wakes up in hospital is reach out to his supplier for a little extra-medicinal support ( he 's played by @entity67 with much the same gusto he brings to " @entity69 " ) , but whip refuses his offer of booze and goes on the wagon for a spell			2
that resolve crumbles when he realizes the kind of trouble he 's in			0
when he picks up a fellow addict ( @entity79 ) and offers her shelter in the out - of - the - way farm where he grew up , it 's a toss - up whether he 's trying to help or looking for a like - minded screw - up and enabler			0
the relationship is well - acted without ever quite dispelling the whiff of the screenwriting manual			0
and that goes for the movie as a whole , which is always expert and sometimes extremely tense , but maybe a bit too on the nose			0
this is a good movie , but not a great one			0
still , @entity17 is very fine , packing some extra baggage around the midriff here , his customary swagger speckled with resentment and soulful self - doubt			1
whip 's a terrific pilot and a deeply flawed human being -- an atheist who will pray with a surviving crew - member if that 's what it takes to secure a friendly witness for his hearing			1
it 's not too often we find such questionable characters at the heart of big budget movies like this , and there 's a lived - through - it quality to the movie 's observations on alcoholism that helps " flight " transcend its occasional cliches and even its cop - out sentimental ending			1
@entity37 squeezes maximum suspense out of whip 's wobbly sobriety -- the mini-bar has never looked so sinister -- but even he has trouble disguising the hollow dilemma propping up @entity131 ' story : is it okay for a pilot to be drunk in charge of an aircraft ? i think we all know the answer to that one .			1

" flight " stars @entity17 as a flawed airline pilot
*critic* praises the spectacular plane crash in film
there 's also a love story between @entity149 and another troubled character
