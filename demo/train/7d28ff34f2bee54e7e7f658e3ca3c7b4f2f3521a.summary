-- @entity1 and @entity2 are locked in a fierce struggle that has escalated greatly following friday 's downing of a @entity6 f - 4 jet by the @entity2 authorities			1
the two heavily armed neighbors are inching gradually into a military confrontation , one that is unlikely to be isolated and that has the potential to turn into a region - wide conflict			0
consequently it could take just one spark -- an incident such as this -- to ignite a fire between @entity19 and @entity20 , the flames of which could enflame the entire region			1
at this particular juncture @entity1 is refraining from taking any military measures against @entity2			1
in tuesday 's speech to the @entity1 parliament , prime minister @entity26 stressed that his country was adopting a " common - sense " attitude that " should not be perceived as a weakness "			0
@entity1 's new approcah relies on active diplomacy , potent economic sanctions and pschological warfare , and the mobilization of both @entity38 and the western powers , in an effort to isolate the @entity42 regime further			0
security clearance : can @entity1 force @entity44 , @entity38 to attack @entity2 ? it is worth noting that @entity38 members and @entity48 foreign ministers have called on @entity1 to show restraint and avoid action that could escalate into war			2
" military intervention in @entity2 is out of the question , " said the @entity53 @entity52			2
however , @entity26 stressed that " the rules of engagement of the @entity58 have changed			0
" he stated that any advance by @entity2 forces toward the @entity1 border would be seen as a threat and " treated as a military target			1
" what this really means is that @entity1 is establishing a de facto safe zone that hinders @entity2 's ability to move troops close to the border			1
this will allow the @entity2 rebels to gather strength in that the border area and advance toward the @entity2 heartlands			0
@entity74 of course spoke carefully in his speech on tuesday : he stressed that his country talks softly but warned that @entity1 's " wrath is fierce and intense when it needs to be "			0
there is no mistaking the implied threat : the de factor safe zone means @entity1 would not allow @entity2 forces near border , thus allowing the rebels a free movement there			1
so while @entity1 is not threatening to launch a pre-emptive attack on the @entity42 regime it is certainly taking indirect steps to support the @entity2 rebels			2
recent reports claim that @entity1 , along with @entity89 and @entity90 , is channeling arms to @entity2 rebels with @entity44 's implicit consent , though @entity19 denies that it is doing so			1
turning to the actual attack on the @entity1 jet , much remains unclear			0
we do n't know how long it was in @entity2 territory for			0
and was it an innocent mistake on the part of the pilots , or was the plane on a surveillance mission to monitor developments inside @entity2 ? the @entity1 authorities refute such claims , and say the jet was testing @entity1 's own radar capabilities			1
on the other hand , @entity2 acknowledges shooting down the jet , but says the downing of the " unidentitifed object " was not an attack			2
the @entity2 government is trying to de-escalate the crisis by saying it did not know it was @entity1 , and was merely defending its territory and not acting aggressively			2
" we had to react immediately , even if the plane was @entity2 we would have shot it down , " said foreign ministry spokesman @entity117 at a press conference in @entity20			2
" the @entity2 response was an act of defense of our sovereignty carried out by anti-aircraft machine gun which has a maximum range of 2.5 km. " but in its letter to the @entity130 @entity129 , @entity1 says that intercepted radio communication shows that @entity2 units were fully aware of the circumstances of the flight and that @entity2 knew exactly who the plane belonged to			0
by downing the reconnaissance aircraft , @entity2 is trying to send a message to @entity1 -- and the world beyond that is supporting the rebels : be wary : this is not @entity141 and we have the military capability and the will to oppose and resist any foreign intervention			1
@entity26 's announcement signals a subtle and important shift in @entity19 's response to the @entity2 crisis , in terms not only of political , economic and psychological pressure on president @entity42 , but also in creating this de facto safe zone that could in theory be enlarged into a base to provide strategic depth for rebels and allow more defectors to enter			1
@entity2 is flexing its muscles , and even though @entity1 is not retaliating militarily , its actions could be a game - changer within @entity2 , and between the two countries that were once close allies			0
the opinions expressed here are solely those of @entity166			0

tensions between @entity1 and @entity2 rise over shooting down of @entity1 military jet
@entity166 says just one spark could ignite a fire between @entity19 and @entity20
@entity1 establishing " safe zone " that hinders @entity2 's ability to move troops , @entity166 says
@entity178 : @entity2 is sending message : we have capability and will to oppose intervention
