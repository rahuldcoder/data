-- attorneys for @entity2 and @entity3 appeared in a @entity5 court to respond to accusations that searches on their websites link the name and photos of a popular @entity11 model to sexually - oriented websites			1
@entity13 is suing the search engines , alleging they linked her name with terms like " sex " and " pornography			1
" @entity20 told @entity0 her pictures would be wrongly used mainly in two ways : an unauthorized picture could be used to lure internet users to an x-rated site , taking advantage of her popularity in @entity11 , or within adult websites that contain pornographic images of other people			1
@entity20 , 30 , originally sued @entity2 and @entity3 in 2006			2
after an eight - year legal battle , the case has worked its way up to @entity11 's @entity35			1
in 2010 , the model was awarded a combined judgment against both search engines of 120,000 @entity11 pesos , almost $ 15,000			1
the search engines appealed and a higher court later lowered the amount to about $ 6,200			1
earlier this week , @entity20 told @entity0 the use of her image by sexually - oriented websites has deeply damaged her reputation			2
" they have ruined my life and now say that what i 'm asking for is censorship			2
it suits them , but not me			2
truthfully for me , having to explain every day that i 'm not a prostitute is a daily complication , as simple as that , " @entity20 said			2
at the court hearing thursday , attorneys for @entity2 and @entity3 suggested search engines are neutral platforms that do n't create or regulate content on the @entity62 , and therefore , are not responsible for how the model 's image is used by third parties			1
@entity66 , an attorney representing @entity3 , said what the plaintiff is asking goes beyond the search engines ' capabilities			1
" it is technically and economically impossible to before - the - fact monitor millions of pages of content available on the internet because of their volume and because they constantly change			0
to argue against this is to favor before - the - fact censorship and to ignore the economic realities , " @entity66 said			0
@entity80 , @entity2 's legal affairs manager for @entity81 , suggested the entire lawsuit could have been averted had the plaintiff contacted the search engines directly to complain about specific websites that used her image illegally			1
that information , @entity80 said , would 've allowed @entity2 to act by either blocking the pages or unlinking results related to modeling pictures belonging to @entity20			0
" in this particular case , there was a consistent and prolonged refusal to identify the content in question , " @entity80 said			0
" it 's necessary to identify the content by providing urls in every single case for the simple reason that if they 're not identified , neither @entity2 nor anybody else is able to determine what we 're talking about			0
" but @entity104 , an attorney representing @entity20 , said search engines have more power to block content than they were willing to admit in court			1
" search engines can find , with their own , diligently designed techniques , websites linked to child pornography they normally block , " @entity111 said			1
he questioned why the search engines can conform with censorship rules in @entity117 but can not protect his client 's reputation			1
@entity2 attorneys said they index web pages based on more than 200 criteria			0
@entity2 's transparency report posted online says so far this year the search engine has received more than 100 million requests to block pages that violate copyright laws or are deemed illegal or harmful in other ways			2
@entity20 , who 's also an actress and a tv host , is a married mother of two children ages 1 and 3			0
she 's a native of @entity133 , @entity11			2
@entity20 is often mistaken by the media for another model from @entity11 by the same name who works in @entity138			1
@entity20 says the case goes beyond her reputation and honor			0
she describes her legal battle as a modern @entity146 fight			0
" let me be clear , first of all , that i want to clear my image , " @entity20 said			0
" second , i want a precedent to be set so that this does n't happen again			0
i 'm in favor of freedom of expression , but not the kind of freedom of expression that is built on lies			0
i 'm an ant fighting against a giant monster			0
" a ruling by the high court is expected in several weeks .			0
