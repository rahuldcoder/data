@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is a regular at the @entity4 -- grateful for the resource but a bit frustrated she has to keep coming			1
about 900 people a week visit the @entity4			0
@entity1 's unemployment rate is 8.3 percent			1
" i am one of 70 or 80 people putting in for just about every position , " @entity9 told us during a visit this past week			0
" it 's been difficult			1
" @entity9 has been looking for work for more than eight months now , often using the computerized job listings at the state - run jobs center			1
" i put in for probably 10 , eight to 10 jobs a week			0
i 've been interviewed for about four a week			0

@entity20 , the @entity4 , @entity1 , regional manager for the job centers , says about 900 people a week visit the midtown facility			1
that 's up 20 percent to 30 percent from the same time a year ago			1
" we 're a seasonal economy up here , and we 're getting into winter season , " @entity20 said			2
" so tourism is down			2
" and the @entity30 is an international hub for freight operations , and that 's been impacted by the economy turning down			1
" new numbers released friday show that the state unemployment rate is 8.4 percent -- up from 6.7 percent a year ago			1
the job market is so tight that the state now posts a caution on its @entity41 web site suggesting people not move to @entity1 unless they already have work lined up			1
" we have a fair amount of people who think that @entity1 is the promised land , and they have misconceptions maybe about what is up here			1
and they load up the family and head out on the @entity1 highway , and we want to encourage them not to do that until they have something lined up before they get here , " @entity20 said			1
state economist @entity59 says @entity1 is often isolated from national economic trends because its economy is so different : manufacturing is for the most part limited to seafood processing , and the economy is built mostly around the energy sector and federal spending on the military and other government installations			1
but the numbers do n't lie			0
" we are part of it like the rest of the country is , " @entity59 said			0
" we are and appear to be more attached , to be more affected by this recession than we 've ever been in prior recessions in this country			2
" the pain is hardest in the rural , remote communities where energy and food costs are way above the national average because of transportation costs			2
a recent @entity85 at @entity4 analysis said unemployment among native alaskans was approaching 20 percent			1
@entity88 , the director of employment and training at the @entity92 's community center , says this is the toughest stretch she has seen in her 10 years of work at the center			1
among native alaskans , she said education rates tend to be lower and poverty rates higher			0
" we have folks that may not have the credentials or the experience , " she said			0
" as it is more competitive , they are less likely to get those positions			0
so it is making it more difficult to help folks find work			2
" the center has benefited from some federal stimulus money to help families with training , child care and other costs			0
but @entity88 , while grateful for that assistance , still sees a tough stretch ahead			0
" i think we are just starting to feel it here , " she says of the recession			2
@entity123 sen. @entity122 believes stimulus money is helping to cushion the blow			0
" if you drive around town you will see some roads paved , some construction projects , " said @entity122 , a former @entity4 mayor			2
he said the state received about $ 1.6 billion in stimulus funds , about a quarter of which he said is being spent on @entity1 military installations			1
" a lot of that i think buffered us at the right time , " @entity122 said			0
@entity138 gov. @entity137 agrees stimulus money has helped the state , but he says he would prefer @entity141 take steps he says would bring longer - term improvements			2
tax cuts aimed at job creation is one wish , a faster decision on proposals for new exploration leases on the outercontinental shelf is another			0
" outercontinental shelf development is 35,000 new jobs , " @entity137 said			0
" i have some concerns about delays and that we have companies awaiting many federal permits , and we 'd like to see them move forward			0
" as for the stimulus money , @entity137 said , " when they try to pump up the states for a year or two with , you know , new medicaid funds , to then cut the states off two years later leaves every state trying to patch that , or fix that hole			2
" that 's the problem with stimulus funds is that they¹re great when they come in but it 's horrible when they¹re gone			2
so , it 's a dependence that gets created that does n't lead to any more freedom or prosperity in the long run			0
" looking ahead , @entity137 is pushing new tourism marketing incentives to help buffer what , at this early point , looks like another tough tourism season next summer			0
and while he believes @entity1 will not be as hard hit as many other states , @entity137 voices the concerns of many here in saying that the fact that the recession arrived here late leads to worries it could linger too long			1
" @entity1 tends to trail the rest of the @entity192 when it comes to the economy			1
so when the rest of the economy is headed up , it takes @entity1 some time behind it , " he said .			1

recession hurts tourism , construction work , freight operations in @entity1
