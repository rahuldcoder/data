-- watching @entity3 's motley , jewel - toned adaptation of " @entity5 , " the best - selling 2003 young - adult novel by @entity7 , i had the distinct sensation of being a young bookworm again , falling into a world as vividly real as it is impossible			1
@entity12 stars as @entity13 , a literature lover who brings characters to life when he reads aloud			1
in @entity7 's universe -- given voice in a screenplay by fantasy - friendly playwright @entity19 -- a literature lover named @entity13 ( @entity12 ) possesses a dangerous talent for bringing characters from books to life when he reads aloud			1
the downside ? when a fictional figure comes alive , a real person must disappear into the book 's pages			2
that explains the extended absence of @entity33 's wife , @entity32 ( @entity34 )			0
@entity33 has not yet told the truth about @entity32 's disappearance to their intrepid young daughter , @entity37 ( @entity39 ) , just as many a movie adult before him annoyingly withheld information from their children for dramatic effect			1
( maybe @entity13 , a pleasantly square - framed @entity45 among a population of @entity47 , just ca n't bring himself to utter the word '' mummy			0
'' ) it also explains the presence of a rambunctious crowd of fictional interlopers			0
these include a soulful fire juggler ( @entity57 ) who yearns for home ( and why not , when real - life wife @entity60 appears briefly as the juggler 's fairy - tale missus ) , and an acquisitive villain named @entity65 ( @entity66 , always welcome even without his @entity68 suit )			1
a unicorn and " @entity71 's " flying monkeys also make appearances -- as does , briefly , @entity73 too			0
the story is a whirl , a jumble , an effusion -- sometimes flowing smoothly , other times jerking along as if the filmmaker ( " @entity76 , " " @entity77 " ) has been given advice he resents regarding pacing and the balance of sweetness and danger			0
there are close calls , weird whispers , amusing throwaway lines , the ditherings of a distractible author ( @entity92 ) , and cartoon violence undertaken by misshapen scary - comic evil henchmen			0
but most deliciously madcap of all , there are the grand gestures and imperious pronouncements of @entity99 as @entity37 's flesh - and - blood great - aunt @entity100 , a creature of pencil - thin eyebrows and luscious costumery who caws and squawks with very unqueenly abandon			1
@entity99 's all - out display in this distinctly @entity107 absurdo - literary extravaganza had me wishing @entity100 were my own fabulous auntie and that she 'd lend me some magic items from her closet			2
