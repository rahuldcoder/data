authorities have imposed a curfew in @entity2 , @entity3 's second - largest city , following nights of deadly communal violence between @entity6 and @entity7			1
two people have been killed and 14 injured since rioting erupted tuesday , col. @entity10 , @entity12 's @entity11 and security minister , told @entity14 friday			2
the rioting began when a mob attacked a tea shop owned by a @entity19 man accused of raping a @entity21 woman , and continued the following night			2
citing officials , the state - run @entity22 of @entity3 newspaper reported that eight separate conflicts took place in the region on tuesday and wednesday night , involving gangs of as many as 450 people , some armed with weapons including swords , firearms , knives , rods and " incendiary materials			1
" one of the victims was @entity19 and one @entity21 , officials said			2
@entity3 is a predominantly @entity21 country , with @entity7 estimated to account for about 5 % of the population			1
@entity3 has witnessed several outbreaks of violence targeting @entity7 in recent years as the country emerges from decades of authoritarian military rule , threatening the country 's fragile political reforms			1
extremist @entity21 nationalist elements , such as the @entity47 , have been accused of fanning the flames of hatred , and pushing for discriminatory laws , including a proposed ban on interfaith marriage			2
fears of new unrest as @entity3 ponders monk - backed interfaith marriage ban radical @entity21 monks , including the @entity47 's spiritual leader , @entity58 , appeared to have played " a pivotal role " in contributing to the latest unrest , said @entity61 , a senior researcher for @entity62			1
anger against the @entity19 tea shop owner , a @entity19 , had escalated after @entity58 had circulated a report of the alleged rape on his @entity68 page , and called for a harsh government response to " jihadist @entity7			2
" there had also been a significant monk presence among the mob , said @entity61			0
" the area where this happened is 5 - 10 minute drive from where @entity58 's monastery is , " he said			0
" this really is his heartland			0
" @entity79 , executive director of rights group @entity80 , said extremists were " using social media as a platform to spread hateful @entity84 rhetoric and in some cases to incite violence			1
" @entity3 's government had temporarily suspended @entity68 in an attempt to tamp down the unrest , he said			1
" it 's a tinderbox that could erupt to unprecedented levels of violence , " he said			0
" the authorities have n't done nearly enough to stem the rising tide of anti-muslim sentiment , and in some cases the government is contributing to its growth , lending public support to extremists and inflammatory draft legislation while failing to protect at - risk @entity19 communities			0
" however , one positive sign was that activists in @entity3 were beginning to stand up against online hate speech and racial violence , he said			2
one of the most influential voices in this movement is @entity111 , a blogger and former political prisoner who in april launched a campaign to counter hate speech with " panzagar , " or " flower speech			0
" " our campaign is trying to change the people 's mindset and trying to create a good culture , " he said , adding that allowing religious and ethnic conflicts to fester had been a technique of @entity3 's rulers since colonial days			1
in the case of the @entity2 unrest , he said , " we clearly saw that this conflict started from online incitements			0
" the government 's failure to prevent the violence also needed to be questioned , he said			0
religious violence has left hundreds of people dead and close to 150,000 homeless since unrest broke out in in the western state of @entity138 in june 2012 , with the stateless @entity19 minority bearing the brunt of the violence			1
outbreaks of @entity84 violence have occurred elsewhere in the country			1
@entity10 said nine people had been arrested over the violence			0
five were @entity19 and four @entity21 , he said			0
@entity149 's silence on the @entity150			0
