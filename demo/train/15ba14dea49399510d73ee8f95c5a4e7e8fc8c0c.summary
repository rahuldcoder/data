-- @entity2 secretary of state @entity1 will this week make her first visit to @entity4 , a nation barely one year old that is locked in a bitter dispute with its northern neighbor , as part of a six - country tour of @entity10			1
@entity13 sets off tuesday on the 11 - day trip , which is intended to emphasize @entity2 efforts to strengthen democracy , encourage economic growth and further peace and security in @entity10 , @entity11 , a @entity12 spokeswoman , said in a statement monday			2
the visit begins in @entity22 , a small country on @entity10 's west coast that has been an outpost of democratic stability in a region with a history of electoral chaos , civil wars and coups			2
despite outbreaks of violence in @entity22 earlier this year surrounding former president @entity33 's decision to seek a controversial third term in office , power passed peacefully to the eventual victor in the presidential election , @entity39			0
@entity13 will meet with @entity39 and " deliver a speech applauding the resilience of @entity22 's democratic institutions and highlighting @entity2 's approach to partnership , " @entity11 said			1
the secretary of state will then travel to one of the tensest areas of @entity10 : @entity4 , which has edged close to full - scale war with @entity4 , the nation from which it separated in july 2011 after decades of bloody conflict			1
the two @entity53 countries still disagree over the demarcation of the border between them and the transportation and processing of oil from @entity4 , which obtained around 70 % of the formerly united country 's reserves when it became independent			1
the @entity62 is pressuring the countries to find a peaceful resolution of the disputes			0
border clashes have displaced at least 150,000 people and created a huge humanitarian crisis			0
while in @entity4 , @entity13 will meet president @entity69 in order to " reaffirm @entity2 support and to encourage progress in negotiations with @entity4 to reach agreement on issues related to security , oil and citizenship , " @entity11 said			1
@entity13 's next stop is @entity80 , where the authorities are dealing with an outbreak of the highly infectious ebola virus that has killed at least 14 people this month			1
@entity80 is " a key @entity2 partner in promoting regional security , particularly in regard to @entity88 and in regional efforts to counter the @entity90 , " @entity11 said			1
a highly effective celebrity - backed social media campaign earlier this year by the nonprofit group @entity92 focused worldwide attention on the @entity90 and its leader , the fugitive warlord @entity95			0
the @entity96 has stepped up efforts this year to capture @entity95 , deploying 5,000 troops in march after a resurgence in attacks by his forces displaced thousands of people in @entity80 , @entity4 , the @entity104 and the @entity105 , according to @entity62 estimates			2
@entity95 is wanted by the @entity107 at the @entity108 for war crimes and crimes against humanity , stemming in part from allegations of his vicious tactics to conscript children as soldiers and sex slaves in his army			0
president @entity119 ordered 100 troops to @entity10 last year to help in the hunt for @entity95			0
the troops are advising regional forces			0
after @entity80 , @entity13 will visit @entity124 , where she will meet local officials , as well as sheikh @entity127 , president of the transitional government of @entity88 , which is trying to emerge from years of civil war			1
security appears to be improving in @entity88 , long considered a failed state , since @entity96 troops pushed @entity133 , an @entity134 militant group affiliated with @entity135 , out of central @entity136 last year after prolonged urban fighting			2
@entity13 will then head south to @entity138 where she will " discuss economic and political governance , " @entity11 said			2
lastly , she will visit @entity141 to participate in a strategic dialogue between the two countries and pay her respects to @entity145 , the former president			0
the frail icon has not appeared in public for years , but he was celebrated worldwide on his 94th birthday earlier this month for his role in reconciling a country torn apart by apartheid .			0
