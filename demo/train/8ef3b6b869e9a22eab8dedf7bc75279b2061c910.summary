-- so , that happened			2
fresh on the heels of the infamous @entity3 , sunday 's " @entity5 " served up more murderous matrimony			1
but , with what fans have dubbed the " @entity8 , " many of us finally got something we 'd been hoping for since season one			1
as the loathsome @entity12 lay on the ground doing his best impersonation of @entity15 from " @entity16 , " one question sprung to mind after the obligatory high fives : who did it ? certainly there is no shortage of folks who would have loved to off the sadistic , smug boy king			1
here , we run down some of the key suspects and why they may have been behind the deadly deed			1
let us know your theory in the comments ( and , book readers , no spoilers , please ! ) @entity33 he 's obviously @entity34 's top suspect			1
and it 's not like he does n't have reasons			1
there was no love lost between @entity33 and his nephew ( remember the much - celebrated slap ? ) even before @entity12 went out of his way to humiliate him repeatedly , both before and after the wedding			2
slicing up his gift of a rare and priceless book ? check			2
wine on the head ? check			0
trying to force him into a humiliating performance at the feast ? check			0
was it all just too much for @entity33 ? not hard to imagine			0
@entity52 and then there 's @entity33 's wife			1
@entity12 was responsible for the deaths of her father , mother and brother			0
and that 's on top of having her publicly beaten and tossing her aside for a more politically useful marriage			1
( not that she wanted anything to do with him by that point			0
) @entity52 may be as close to an innocent as still exists in @entity68			0
but what better time than @entity12 's wedding day to exact some revenge ? @entity72 " the @entity73 are n't the only ones who pay their debts			1
" when the @entity78 sent fiery warrior @entity72 to the wedding in place of his brother , prince @entity81 , it was a not - so - subtle hint that they have n't forgotten , or forgiven , that @entity72 's sister , @entity83 , was raped and killed by @entity84 " @entity85 , who serves the @entity73			1
it only took hearing a @entity88 song , " @entity92 , " to send @entity72 into an @entity90 stabbing fit at a brothel			0
was murdering @entity12 his plan all along ? the @entity94 the wedding was over			0
but @entity96 and the rest of the @entity99 family , particularly @entity96 's grandmother @entity98 , had no doubts about what a rotten little bastard ( literally ) @entity102 was			1
it 's possible they 've concocted a scheme to off @entity12 , but still press their claim for the @entity68 now that @entity96 has a crown on her head			1
@entity111 and @entity112 as @entity114 told @entity12 , the war is not over			0
we assume @entity12 's transition to a lovely shade of purple was due to poisoning			1
but could it have been more dark magic from the @entity122 instead ? it 's easy to focus on the people who were at the wedding			2
but we 've already seen what @entity112 can do to a foe without having to be in his presence			0
could this have been an otherworldly announcement that @entity111 is down , but not out ? somebody else ? seriously , who does n't have one reason or another to want @entity12 dead ? lord @entity133 is n't called " @entity135 " for nothing			0
he 's sneaky , as well as professing to be the only person in @entity137 who truly wants what 's best for the kingdom			2
he could have decided that 's not @entity12			2
@entity142 - turned - fool @entity141 was obviously up to something			0
was this part of a plan to save @entity52 and avenge his humbling by @entity12 ? it 's hard to imagine how @entity149 could have played a part from across the @entity151			2
but could someone loyal to the @entity153 have made a move to weaken the @entity73 ' hold on the throne ? we can presume it will all become clear in time			0
meanwhile , we 'll make a mental note to never , ever , accept a wedding invitation in @entity137 .			0
