-- while the rest of us were watching two boats battling it out in one of the most thrilling sailing competitions of all time , there was another man soaring 400 meters above the waves watching our every move			1
hanging out of an open - door helicopter flying high above @entity13 , is all part of a day 's work for sports photographer @entity16 , who took these remarkable images of the @entity18			1
it 's not always easy finding an interesting angle when photographing endless blue sea and sky , but @entity16 managed to capture the grace -- and adrenalin -- of sailing , using high - tech equipment on land , sea , and air			1
" i do n't like flying that much , " admitted 39 - year - old @entity16 , a photographer with one of the biggest news agencies in the world , @entity33 , for over 15 years			1
" but having a camera makes being in a helicopter a little easier because i 'm concentrating on my job and trying to get these pictures -- rather than actually thinking ' i 'm flying above the water with no door			2
' " golden backdrop this was one of the first times the prestigious race had been held in a city , rather than out at sea , giving @entity16 a rare opportunity to capture the dramatic skyline of his hometown			1
as @entity52 billionaire @entity51 's yacht @entity53 made a dramatic comeback against @entity55 , in one of the most nail - biting finishes in the competition 's 162 - year history , it was up to @entity16 to capture the drama , with his images used in newspapers across the world			1
" @entity64 is pretty spectacular and the skyline is beautiful			0
so to be able to work those two elements into the picture gave me a chance to get a variety of different images that would n't have been possible in other @entity71 , " said @entity16			2
" @entity13 also has lots of different micro climates -- the fog might roll in one day and they 'd be blue sky the next , which made for interesting images			0
" speed machines but it was n't just helicopters helping @entity16 get a fresh perspective of the historic race			2
the photographer -- who covered last year 's @entity85 -- also jumped aboard a powerboat to get close to the action			0
it was hard work keeping up with the futuristic yachts -- which glide along the waves at 80 kilometers per hour -- not to mention taking photographs on a violently bouncing speedboat			0
" these sailboats go so fast that the motorboats we were on really could n't keep up with them			0
so you have to pick a few key spots on the course , " explained @entity16			2
" i was carrying heavy equipment going out on a boat day after day -- i went to the gym a lot more , " he joked			0
@entity104 it 's an indication of how far sports photography has developed in recent years , with international agencies using everything from helicopters to high - tech underwater camera equipment to get a shot no one else has			1
" one of the guys on the motorboat had been photographing sailing for 30 years and was talking about @entity18 in @entity117 in the 80s , " explained @entity16			1
" he would have somebody bring him more film on the boat because he 'd run out			0
" it 's great shooting on digital , because you 're rocking up and down on a boat so much with these long lenses			0
i 'd be taking thousands of images a day to get it down to 30 or 40 pictures that i would transmit to the @entity33 website			0
" capturing the moment but for @entity16 , the secret to taking a good photograph is n't necessarily gadgets or extreme helicopter rides -- it 's having a good eye			1
" the moment is very important -- one of my photos of the two boats passing behind @entity64 captures them just as they 're between the lines , " he said			0
" great moments in sports photography are very important , where you 're capturing the millisecond of something happening			2
