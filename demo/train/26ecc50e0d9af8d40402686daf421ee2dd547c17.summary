a prankster @entity152 ok , so it 's not the real @entity155 god			0
but every time a @entity157 ship crosses the @entity158 , a crew member who does a very good take on @entity152 hosts a circle - crossing ceremony on the top deck			1
ultimately , this jokester dumps a ladle of ice water down each passenger 's back			0
bowling balls and pins no stale nachos and tacky carpeting at the bowling alleys on @entity174 's @entity173			0
