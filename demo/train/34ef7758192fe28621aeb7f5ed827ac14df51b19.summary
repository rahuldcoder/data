-- seven years ago , @entity1 was established as the online counterpart to @entity3 , a day when internet retailers would band together to lure holiday shoppers to web storefronts through steep discounts , free shipping and other promotions			1
so far , @entity1 has delivered on its mission , becoming the biggest single shopping day of the year for online retailers			1
and it keeps getting bigger : sales on the day amounted to $ 1.25 billion in the @entity15 in 2011 , up 22 % from 2010 ′ s record highs , according to @entity17			0
sales on the second biggest shopping day of the year , @entity3 , tallied $ 816 million			1
but a number of trends — online retailers ' increasing participation in @entity3 offers and the rise of multi-channel shopping , among others — leave many asking : is there still a need for cyber monday ? " it is losing some of its luster , " @entity29 , chief industry analyst at @entity30 , observed in a phone interview			1
in an effort to get a leg up on online retailers and each other , many brick - and - mortar retailers — including some of the biggest , such as @entity39 — opened their stores as early as 8 p.m. the day before this past @entity3 , and advertised their deals online in the days and weeks leading up to the event			1
" as a result , online retailers are moving their sales earlier too , " @entity29 explained			1
many multi-channel and pure - play online retailers now run promotions on @entity50 and @entity3 , as well as cyber monday			1
some have pushed the envelope even further : for the past few years , @entity54 has opened its so - called " @entity3 " store of discounted products weeks before the actual event			0
why start earlier ? in part because consumers are expected to start shopping earlier than ever before — though it 's tough to say whether it 's the consumers or the retailers — with their early promotions — who are driving it			2
in general , launching promotions at an earlier date means retailers do n't have to discount as deeply or for as long later in the season , said @entity71 , an analyst at @entity72			0
cyber monday starts early this year shifts in shopping patterns and consumer technology use are also driving the change			1
shoppers are no longer buying offline on some days , and online on others : they 're shopping on both simultaneously , often whipping out their smartphones or tablets in - store to run price comparisons			0
just take a look at last week 's figures : online sales were up 17.4 % on @entity50 and 20.7 % on @entity3 , according to @entity87			1
@entity88 accounted for 16.3 % of all online sales , up from a record - setting 9.8 % in 2011			2
@entity88 has put online retailers and brick - and - mortar retailers into more direct competition with each other , opening a window for pure - play ecommerce players to compete on @entity3 and other big in - store shopping days like never before			2
as a result , online retailers ca n't afford to wait until cyber monday to make compelling offers ; they need to make them available on friday or before if they want to capture sales from smartphone - touting shoppers in stores			1
" what that does is spread out the sales period , thereby diluting it , " @entity29 said			0
" retailers now have to promote throughout the whole holiday season to stay competitive			0
" cyber monday was , as we mentioned , the biggest online - sales day in the @entity15 last year , but growth is flattening			1
whereas 2011 saw 22 % growth since 2010 , @entity29 said retailers will be lucky to see more than 10 % growth this year , while overall online spending during the holiday period will rise 16.8 % ( per @entity118 )			2
a recent survey conducted by @entity120 found that @entity1 ranks " fairly low " on shoppers ' key days , with only 7 % planning to purchase electronics on that day , and even less expecting to buy toys and apparel			2
what 's an online retailer to do ? @entity71 said the key to any successful promotional period is the quality of the promotion on offer			0
so long as the deals are compelling , online retailers can expect to see " strong double - digit growth " on monday , outpacing the overall growth of the ecommerce industry this year , she said			1
" if retailers are offering the exact same thing on @entity3 [ and @entity1 ] , there 's a problem			2
but i think retailers are smarter than that and i expect to see different offers , " @entity71 said			0
" other days [ of the holiday - shopping season ] are compelling , but that in no way indicates @entity1 is becoming obsolete			2
" she also anticipates that the concept of @entity1 will evolve , and become more multi-channel : " we 'll start to see @entity1 offers not just online , but also in stores			0
" for his part , @entity29 believes cyber monday will be important for years to come , but will phase out eventually			1
" the pure players are n't going to abandon it ; this was a gift given to them just a few years ago , " he said			0
" but it will be redefined , repackaged			0
" in the future , he expects to see online retailers offer more limited - time flash sales to motivate consumers to turn to that channel throughout the holiday season			1
still , online stores will have a " tough time " competing on @entity160 , @entity29 added			0
" online is convenient , yes , but it 's still a solitary process			0
what online retailers need to do is turn it into a much more social event ; it needs to engage families and friends in a much bigger , better way			2
that 's where the stores still beat them			0
" brand strategist explains the end of @entity1 © 2013 @entity0			0

@entity1 has been the biggest single shopping day of the year for online retailers
but retailers are spreading their online sales throughout the @entity50 holiday
as a result , cyber monday 's growth is flattening
analyst : cyber monday will phase out eventually
