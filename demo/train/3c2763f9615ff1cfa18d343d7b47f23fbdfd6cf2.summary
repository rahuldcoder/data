-- talk about being a victim of your own success			0
among several new initiatives announced by @entity5 at the @entity6 was a two - day giveaway of 700 issues of classic @entity5 no. 1 issues via their app. the adventures , new and old , of the @entity13 , @entity12 and the @entity14 would be available free , and the first issues would make it easier for new readers to follow			1
it was an unprecedented offer in the world of digital comics			2
but perhaps it was one that its technology partner , @entity24 , was unprepared for : the servers crashed			1
one day after the freebies were announced at @entity5 's @entity29 panel in @entity30 , @entity31 , it was put to a halt -- at least temporarily -- by @entity24			1
the problem : too much interest			0
" we expected a high degree of excitement for the @entity5 initiative -- and had believed ourselves prepared -- but unfortunately we became overwhelmed by the immense response , " admitted @entity24 's ceo and co-founder , @entity37			1
" we 're still struggling to keep our systems up			0
" @entity37 added , " we do n't like letting you down			0
our teams are working around the clock to resolve these issues so that you can have the experience you 've come to expect			2
" he said the promotion would be " pausing for the time being			2
" comics readers were told to post their e-mail addresses on a form to be notified when the offer would be back up and running			0
@entity5 posted a statement to its website : " @entity5 fans assembled in record numbers to take advantage of the landmark @entity5 # 1 digital comics sale ! the demand has been so overwhelmingly positive , in fact , that a number of technical issues have arisen with our technology partner in getting the more than 700 free issues to each of you			1
when we have further updates from our partner , we will share them			0
" the advent of reading comics digitally , especially on tablets , has been seen by some as the future of the comics industry , as print readership continues to decline			0
to that end , @entity5 has increased its presence at @entity29 , this year announcing products such as the weekly @entity82 , which are specifically designed with the digital reader in mind , and @entity85 , which adds audio to the digital reading experience .			1
