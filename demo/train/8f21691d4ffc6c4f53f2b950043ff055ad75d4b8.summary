-- last weekend 's @entity1 was an encouraging race for @entity3 , with @entity5 's victory lifting some of the gloom which had descended over the legendary @entity8 team after a disappointing preseason			1
but while double world champion @entity5 celebrated an unlikely triumph in one garage , the mood was considerably more sombre in the camp of his teammate @entity14			2
the @entity15 has seen his position at @entity18 's most successful team constantly called into question , having struggled to recapture his best form after fracturing his skull during a freak accident at the @entity23			2
the former @entity26 driver 's downturn continued with a disappointing 15th - place finish at the @entity28 , having failed to finish the season - opening race in @entity30 after colliding with @entity32 ' @entity31			1
but @entity3 's team principal @entity33 has backed the 30 - year - old to answer his critics			1
" i well remember that , four years ago , in fact right after a @entity38 @entity1 , which was won for us by @entity40 , @entity14 was more or less in the same situation as today , " @entity33 told the team 's official website			1
" the papers were demanding his immediate replacement and he managed to react in the best way possible , thanks to support from the team , which saw him win two of the next three races			0
" in 2008 , @entity14 was denied his first world title in heartbreaking circumstances			0
he won the season - ending @entity15 @entity1 and began celebrating , but was denied the championship by one point as @entity58 's @entity57 driver @entity56 overtook @entity59 on the final corner to finish fifth and steal the glory			0
" we remember how that particular season ended , with the @entity15 actually world champion , even if it was just for a few seconds , while we took our sixteenth @entity67 ' title , " @entity33 said			0
he also revealed that , instead of spending time with his family ahead of the next race in @entity70 on april 15 , @entity14 is heading to @entity8 to work with the team at @entity3 's home base			1
" he will be in @entity73 to work alongside the engineers to calmly analyze everything that happened in these past two races , trying to identify why he was not able to deliver what he is capable of , " @entity33 said			2
" that 's the right spirit and we are here , ready to help him			0
" despite a positive result in @entity38 , @entity33 warned there is still work to do to ensure the @entity84 car is competitive ahead of the next race in @entity87			1
" i asked all my people to push to the maximum to try to bring forward as much as possible the developments planned for the next few races , " he said			0
" having @entity5 leading the championship means nothing , and we definitely do n't think all our problems have been made to vanish with the wave of a magic wand			0

@entity3 team principal @entity33 says @entity14 can return to form
