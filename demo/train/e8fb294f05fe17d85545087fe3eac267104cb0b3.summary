the vice president of iraq -- the country 's top @entity1 politician -- pleaded for calm monday following his death sentence in absentia , while lashing out at @entity7 prime minister @entity6 over what he described as a politically motivated case			1
the fallout over the death sentence handed down to @entity12 has generated a political split along sectarian lines in @entity15 , raising fears the conflict will translate into violence in the streets			1
" the verdict is unjust , political and illegitimate and i will not acknowledge it , " @entity12 told reporters in @entity21 , @entity22 , where he has been living since fleeing @entity15 five months ago			1
the verdict was handed down sunday , the same day a wave of bombings across @entity15 left up to 94 people dead and more than 300 wounded			1
@entity29 in @entity15 -- an umbrella group for predominantly @entity1 insurgents -- claimed responsibility for the attacks in a post on monday on a well - known jihadist web site			1
" to my dear people , i say , make sure that @entity6 and those who stand behind him do n't get what he wishes			0
because they want sectarian strife , " @entity12 said			0
" whoever loves @entity12 and believes in my vision , do not target or harm any civilian or any resident in @entity15 either by your action or your speech , " he said			2
@entity48 has vehemently denied charges of overseeing death squads that carried out more than 150 attacks , accusing @entity6 of pushing the case as part of an effort to consolidate power and push the country toward a religious divide			1
" @entity6 is pushing my country to a turning point with a deeply sectarian dimension , " @entity12 told @entity58 in an interview earlier this year			0
at the time , he warned that the @entity65 " will face the same problem as they faced in 2003 " when a @entity65 - led coalition toppled @entity67 , igniting sectarian violence that nearly tore the country apart			0
@entity6 has dismissed the claims , saying there are a number of @entity1 in key government positions			2
critics point to @entity6 's failure to name ministers to key posts , including the ministries of interior and defense			0
months before @entity65 troops withdrew from @entity15 , @entity65 military officials failed to get @entity6 to fill what the ministry positions that are seen as essential to stability in @entity15			2
@entity29 in @entity15 , also known as the @entity85 , warned following a spate of attacks in july and august that it planned to rally @entity1 across the country			1
the claim has raised concerns that the group could unite @entity1 who feel disenfranchised by the political process			1
while sectarian violence has decreased since the height of the @entity65 - led war in 2005 and 2006 , there has been a sharp escalation in attacks in recent months			0
in july , the number of dead hit a two - year peak with 325 deaths reported , according to the @entity102			0
that 's the deadliest single month since august 2010 , it said			0
the timing of @entity12 's death sentence also threatens to upend @entity15 's fragile power - sharing agreement that has been mired for more than a year in political infighting			1
" it was regrettable that the judicial decision against him was issued at this particular time and he is still officially in his position , which could become a factor that does not help or may complicate efforts to achieve national reconciliation , " @entity15 president @entity109 said in a statement monday			2
under the proposal , the three major governmental positions -- prime minister , president and parliament speaker -- were to be filled by members of the country 's three largest ethnic groups : the @entity7 , the @entity127 and the @entity1			1
as late as july , the @entity128 called on @entity15 to carry out long - postponed political reconciliation talks , saying all sides need to refrain from making statements that could aggravate tensions over efforts to push for inclusive political talks and national reconciliation in @entity15			2
lawmaker @entity136 , a member of @entity12 's @entity1 - dominated @entity138 political party , criticized the timing of the sentencing			1
" @entity15 is preparing for a big national reconciliation in the near future in order to achieve stability in this country , " he said			2
" this will not help			0
" there are also questions about what the sentencing means for already tense relations between @entity15 and @entity22			2
the two countries have been divided over @entity153 and the @entity155 militant group @entity154 , which has launched attacks from @entity15 into @entity22 for years in effort to gain @entity155 autonomy			1
shortly after @entity12 's sentence was announced , the @entity159 said he could remain in @entity22 for as long as he wants , according to media reports			0
@entity48 has refused to return to @entity15 , saying he could not get a fair trial from a court backed by @entity6			1
@entity15 's @entity164 sentenced @entity12 to be hung for the killings of a female lawyer and an @entity15 army general , according to a court spokesman			1
@entity48 can appeal the death sentence			1
the arrest warrant for @entity12 was issued late last year after his @entity138 party announced a boycott of @entity173 , saying @entity6 was cutting it out of the decision - making process			0
his sunni - majority party has since ended its boycott			0
the case appeared to largely rest on the purported confession of three men , who were identified as members of the vice president 's security detail			0
@entity15 state television aired video of the confessions in december , though @entity12 's supporters said the confessions were coerced			1
@entity58 has not been able to verify the identities of the three men			0
among the aired confessions was one by a man who detailed @entity12 's involvement in roadside bombings and shootings that targeted government and security officials in 2009			0
@entity48 fled the same day the arrest warrant was issued , first to @entity15 's semiautonomous @entity155 region north of @entity199			1
he then went to @entity22			0
@entity15 asked for help from @entity201 , which issued a " red notice " that calls on the 190 countries that belong to the international police organization to help locate and arrest @entity12			2
no action appears to have been taken to return @entity12 to @entity199			0
he currently is living in a government house in @entity207 .			0
