-- the player tumbles to the ground , writhing around as if he has been mortally wounded			2
television replays , however , show that his opponent has made no contact at all			2
it 's an ever - increasing sight on football grounds around the world , and -- in the @entity9 , at least -- it 's becoming an increasingly emotive issue			1
@entity11 was labeled a " con artist " after his theatricals earned @entity13 a match - turning penalty kick in a game against @entity17 on saturday			1
earlier this season , @entity20 's @entity19 was the subject of countless negative headlines as he went to ground in the penalty area , and @entity26 's @entity25 has been booked four times for diving -- double that of any other @entity9 player			1
the scourge of trying to win free - kicks , and especially penalties , in such a way has long been a thorn in football 's side , with fans often outraged by what they see as sporting fraud			1
@entity0 's very own @entity13 fanatic @entity41 took to @entity42 to decry @entity11 's actions , saying he was " ashamed to see an @entity13 player cheat so badly			1
" one man who has also never been short of opinions on the subject of cheating is former @entity50 chairman @entity49			2
the @entity52 lawyer presided over @entity50 from its inception in 1999 until 2007 , a year when cycling 's governing body tried to sue him for critical comments about its former chief @entity58			1
@entity59 had earned the wrath of @entity61 for saying it could do more to target doping , but his words were comprehensively borne out years later by the @entity66 @entity65 's report into @entity67 , in which everyday items such as butter ( apparently short - hand for the hormone @entity70 ) and olive oil ( the vehicle for absorbing testosterone ) took on very different meanings			1
@entity49 believes there are five main reasons why athletes resort to performance - enhancing drugs -- considered by most sports fans to be the worst form of cheating			1
" there are reasons but then there are also excuses , " he told @entity0			1
a desire to win at all costs -- even if that means lying			0
for financial reasons -- with professionals trying to extend a career			1
national pressures -- as exemplified by the old @entity96 system			0
individual pressure from coaches -- who get paid better if they coach winners , and that can apply for administrations too			0
finally , they dope because they believe they will not get caught -- they believe they are invincible			0
" on the latter point , the sad truth is that many do successfully beat the drug testers , as did @entity67 and his former @entity66 @entity113 teammate @entity112 , who confessed all in a plea bargain in october			0
' leveling the playing field ' " early in my professional career , it became clear to me that , given the widespread use of performance - enhancing drugs by cyclists at the top of the profession , it was not possible to compete at the highest level without them , " said @entity112 , who decided to end his 18 - year top - level career			0
his account tallies with the view of @entity129 , a professor of culture , media and sport at @entity134 in @entity135 who has conducted research into the use of drugs in sport			0
" i do n't think there 's a conscious motivation when people dope to gain an unfair advantage			1
my strong belief is that they are trying to level the playing field , knowing that there are so many others doping that they will be disadvantaged if they do n't , " says @entity144 , whose low opinion of drug testers and high hopes for healthier athletes makes him that rarity -- a public advocate for the use of drugs in sports			1
" i wo n't divulge names but one sprinter , who doped with impunity , told me : ' for several years , i was coming fourth or fifth despite training as hard as i could			0
yet i knew that the people beating me were n't training as hard nor did they have the same athletic capacity			0
' " so the sprinter doped -- with the " leveling the playing field " argument used by many sportsmen , including @entity168 's coach @entity167 , who said the disgraced @entity52 was left with no alternative given the riddled nature of athletics at the time he was winning , then losing , the 1988 @entity173 100 meters final			1
the plunge into drugs is also tempting because it tends to lead to ever - increasing fortunes , with better performances leading to better results and hence greater earnings			0
" if you use drugs , it 's because you want a shortcut -- a shortcut to everything , " says @entity182 athlete @entity181 , a silver medalist at the @entity184 whose career ended in controversy when he tested positive for an anabolic steroid			1
" once you start winning , sponsors will be attracted and then money will come			0
it is an easy way to make money			0
some athletes will dope for four to five years without being caught and will make a lot of money in that time , " the former 800m specialist , now 38 , told @entity0			1
" the big problem in @entity182 is that our sportsmen compare themselves internationally			0
they are young , they 've heard about doping and their mind tells them that they need drugs to beat the rest -- it 's all about meeting goals and people wanting quick money			1
" @entity213 , @entity67 had amassed a $ 70 million fortune according to @entity215 , while fellow @entity66 @entity216 had several multimillion - dollar sponsorship deals before the sprinter 's drug admission prompted her supersonic fall from grace			1
' sophisticated skulduggery ' at the other end of the scale , lying to earn more money is rampant in @entity182 football , where countless " promising " players have concocted false -- and younger -- ages in a bid to appear more enticing to any potential @entity230 suitors ( and thus secure a way out of poverty )			2
this year @entity233 was thrown out of the 2013 african under - 17 championship qualifiers , while @entity235 was disqualified from the 2009 tournament for fielding a 22 - year - old and its host @entity239 dropped several of its squad following age tests			0
while that might seem an almost understandable form of cheating , the infamous actions of @entity244 pentathlete @entity243 at the @entity245 are anything but			0
the three - time @entity244 world champion employed sophisticated skulduggery as he rewired his epee so that it would score points when it did not deserve to , as he tried to turn the silver medal he had won four years previously into gold			0
his " desire to win at all costs " earned him the nickname " @entity256 " -- though little was heard of him after the @entity257			0
it is unclear whether @entity261 had acted with the help of the @entity244 team , a subject that had great relevance at the time given the ideological battles -- and sporting subterfuge -- of the @entity269			2
@entity261 aside , the @entity245 were also notable for the second - place finish in the medal table achieved by @entity96			0
a country of just 16 million , it was one of the dominant powers in sports such as swimming and track in the 1970s and early ' 80s -- which was later explained by the state - sponsored doping system that was uncovered after the fall of the @entity283			2
many athletes were unwittingly doped , with @entity286 newspaper @entity285 reporting in 2005 that an estimated 800 later suffered serious health issues			2
the most public face of the scandal was @entity290 , a female shot - putter who was given so many steroids that she later opted to have a sex change and is today known as @entity293			2
while @entity96 's rulers felt sporting glory suitably reflected the successes of their political ideology , so prompting their top - down approach , soccer star @entity298 did it the other way -- waging war , quite literally , single - handed			1
after his " @entity304 " goal in the 1986 @entity303 helped @entity305 beat @entity135 , one of football 's all - time greats justified his deception by referencing his country 's unhappiness over the 1982 @entity312			1
@entity313 lay claim to the islands , which it calls @entity316 , over which the @entity286 have sovereignty			0
as clearly seen , the pressure to succeed often takes sportsmen and women into unexpected territory			0
we are often told that tiny factors make the difference in top - level sports , yet the measures used to gain them are often anything but insignificant			2
examples abound -- but how many can prove the point better than @entity332 's intentional crash in the @entity333 , following team orders , which enabled @entity336 teammate @entity335 to win the race after the safety car came out ? with @entity347 teams spying on one another , boxers loading their gloves with weights , marathoners crossing the finishing line without running the distance , rugby players using fake blood capsules to feign injury ( and so enable a team substitution ) and @entity345 's 2000 @entity344 basketball gold medalists later stripped of their title after nearly all their team were revealed to have no disability , arguably the very concept of " sport " has been defeated			2
there may even be a measure of sympathy for the international sports bureaucracy -- the men and women running global sport 's governing bodies			1
they would seem to need a full - time investigation unit to weed out all the ingenious methods being used to cheat			2
with that in mind , is it any wonder that @entity377 -- as it tackles the debilitating threat of organized match - fixing in soccer -- has enlisted the help of worldwide police agency @entity379 in recent years ?			0
