she used to go through tampons every hour , excusing herself to go to the bathroom between appointments			2
heavy bleeding made doing what she really loved -- hiking -- especially difficult			1
truth is , she wanted her period to go away altogether			1
in 2003 @entity14 , then age 51 , got her wish			2
she had a minor surgical procedure called endometrial ablation , or by its brand name , @entity19 , to remove her uterine lining and stop heavy bleeding			1
and she has n't had a period since			1
" i was delighted , " she says			2
" up until that time i 'd never missed one period			1
" @entity14 recently hiked 8,000 feet to the ancient @entity25 city of @entity26 in @entity27			2

" your uterus is a muscle , and it squeezes really hard , " says @entity55 , @entity56 , an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at @entity59			0
" sometimes it can squeeze so hard it blocks the arteries coming into it			0
just like in a heart attack , when the arteries are blocked , it causes pain			0
" @entity70 : pelvic pain -- solve the mystery the fixes @entity74 , aspirin , and ibuprofen help by short - circuiting the production of pain - causing chemicals called prostaglandins that are involved in muscle contractions			1
they work best if you start an hour before your cramps hit			1
" load up with a double dose and keep the blood level up , " @entity55 says			0
( the maximum safe daily dose of ibuprofen is 2,400 milligrams , or 12 200 - mg pills			1
take the minimum dosage that works for you			0
) right when you get your period , start with 800 mg and then go to 600 mg every six hours			1

) the five - minute procedure is done in a gynecologist 's office			1
many women report lighter bleeding right away			1
and a recent study found that after seven years , more than 95 percent stopped having periods			1
the 365 - day birth - control pill , called @entity153 , is another way to skip monthly menstruation			0
approved by the @entity96 in may , @entity153 has no placebo pills , so you just keep taking an active pill each day			0
( breakthrough bleeding can be an issue for about 20 percent of users			1
and , since @entity153 contains estrogen , it 's not for women who are prone to blood clots , such as smokers , who get migraines with an aura or who are over age 35 with elevated heart disease risks			1

( @entity240 may help even out hormone levels , although no one knows for sure why it works			0
) besides , most women do n't get enough calcium in their diets anyway			1
she suggests 1,200 mg daily , and not just on the day you 're @entity34 - ing. " it should help take the edge off " over time , @entity216 says			0
@entity250 exercise -- like fast walking , lifting weights , or even dancing -- may be the last thing you want to do when in the throes of @entity34 , but it has proven antidepressant and antianxiety effects			0
@entity257 ( @entity258 , @entity259 , @entity259 , and @entity260 , to name a few ) can relieve severe symptoms			0

to avoid tummy irritation , take it with food			0
all of the above some women experience a combo of excessive bleeding , cramping , breast tenderness , headaches , @entity34 , and other troubles			1
what to do ? the fix stop treating the individual symptoms			0
@entity290 recommends continuous birth control pills -- you just skip the placebo week and move on to your next pack			0
