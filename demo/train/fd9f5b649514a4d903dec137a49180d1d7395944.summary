-- fifty - three determined men and women will sport @entity4 's green and white colors during the @entity5 -- the second - biggest @entity7 team hailing from @entity8 -- carrying the nation 's hopes for the first gold medal in 16 years			1
amongst those bidding for @entity7 glory is canoeist @entity14 , the first athlete to paddle for @entity4 at the world 's major sport event -- the 23 - year - old enters the race on july 29 , just two days after the @entity5 ' opening ceremony			1
born and raised in the @entity22 to a @entity4 father and a @entity22 mother , @entity14 's path to the @entity21 has been as winding as the whitewater courses he navigates			1
he first started canoeing aged 12 in northern @entity27 and in 2006 he emerged as the junior @entity22 national champion			2
but a year later he gave up his top ranking in the country of his birth to compete for the country of his heritage following a visit to his father 's homeland -- a trip he describes as a " baptism of fire			0
" " it was just such a great experience , " remembers @entity14 of his time in the @entity42 country			1

in february this year his @entity7 dream finally came true when he made @entity4 history by winning the 2012 @entity42 slalom championships and securing a place for @entity94			1
