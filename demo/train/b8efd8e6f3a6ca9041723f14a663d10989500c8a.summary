@entity0 , @entity1 -- convicted leaker @entity3			0
@entity4 acknowledged wednesday that by leaking tens of thousands of pages of classified documents he " hurt people and hurt the @entity6			1
" " i understood what i was doing was wrong but i did n't appreciate the broader effects of my actions , " he said during his sentencing hearing at @entity1 's @entity0			1
" i only wanted to help people , not hurt people			0
" the former army intelligence analyst was convicted in july of stealing and disseminating 750,000 pages of documents and videos to @entity18 in what has been described as the largest leak of classified material in @entity6 history			1
he was found guilty of 20 of the 22 charges against him , including violations of the @entity6 @entity26			0
@entity18 founder @entity27 took the military court to task , saying it was out to humiliate @entity4			1
" mr. @entity4 's forced decision to apologise to the @entity6 government in the hope of shaving a decade or more off his sentence must be regarded with compassion and understanding , " a statement from @entity27 , now holed up in the @entity32 's embassy in @entity33 , said			1
" mr. @entity4 's apology is a statement extorted from him under the overbearing weight of the @entity6 military justice system			1
" how many years @entity4 spends behind bars is up to col. @entity45 , the judge in the case			1
she already found him not guilty of the most serious charge -- aiding the enemy -- and she later granted a defense motion that decreased the maximum penalty @entity4 faced from 136 years in prison to 90 years			2
@entity4 has claimed he leaked the material to expose wrongdoing and provoke discussion about @entity6 military and diplomatic affairs			2
but in court on wednesday , he told the judge that he now recognized he should have handled it a different way			0
" i should have worked more aggressively within the system , " he said			0
@entity4 also said at the time he decided to leak the documents , he was " dealing with a lot of issues " -- a reference to his gender identity crisis that the defense has made a focal point in the case			1
but he told the judge it was not an excuse for what he did			0
while @entity4 said he recognized that he has to pay a price for what for he did , he told the judge that he hoped someday to get out of prison and lead a productive life			1
his statement followed testimony from a military psychologist , who said @entity4 appeared to be isolated and under intense pressure as a male soldier struggling with gender identity issues			1
" there would never be a time that he could be openly female , " capt. @entity84 testified			0
" and so seeking treatment for that , treatment was how to adjust to that , not treat the disorder , but how to be comfortable with that in the @entity92			0
" father : my son was ' grandstanding ' with much of the testimony in @entity4 's sentencing hearing focusing on his gender identify issues , the @entity92 on wednesday released a full version of an e-mail he had sent to his sergeant titled " my problem			1
" while @entity4 does not specifically identify the problem he was referring to , the e-mail includes an image of him wearing a long blond wig and makeup			2
" it 's not going away , its haunting me more and more as i get older , " he wrote in the e-mail			0
" now , the consequences of it are dire , at a time when it 's causing me great pain in itself			0
as a result , i 'm not sure what to do about it			0
" @entity4 's sister , @entity122 , and his aunt , @entity124 , asked for leniency in sentencing after providing the court with an intimate look at his upbringing , which they said was characterized by absentee , alcoholic parents			1
but the prosecution has offered a picture of a calculating @entity4 whose behavior was reckless , saying he put the lives of soldiers and civilians in danger			2
during the court - martial , prosecution witnesses testified @entity4 downloaded and leaked 400,000 @entity143 field reports from @entity144 and 90,0000 similar documents from @entity146			2
there evidence also presented that he downloaded and leaked more than 250,000 @entity150 cables			0
the release of the classified material elevated what was once a virtually unknown @entity18 to a globally recognized name			2
outside the courtroom , @entity4 's civilian attorney , @entity155 , said he hoped the judge would see that " @entity4 is certainly a person who had his heart in the right place			1
" earlier in the case , @entity4 testified about his treatment by the @entity163 at @entity164 in @entity165			2
the judge ruled that the @entity163 ' harsh treatment of @entity4 was out of line and granted him 112 days off his eventual sentence			1
