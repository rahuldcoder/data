the man before me is not yet 30			2
he stands , perhaps a little unsure of himself , a nervous tic in his shoulders seeming to betray his unease			2
before him is one of the largest armies on the planet			2
it is a war machine , still fighting a battle from more than half a century ago			1
they move in lockstep , legs kicking and arms swinging as one , discipline and focus measured in millimeters			0
a vast arsenal of weapons , missiles and tanks , pass by			2
the cost of this show of military might has been paid in the suffering of the people it is primed to defend			0
aid groups say thousands have starved here ; meanwhile , the army has grown fat			1
the young man eyeing all of this is master of all he surveys			0
this is @entity36 , and the man is @entity38			1
@entity38 named marshal of @entity36 army this was a rare glimpse indeed of a man who now rules the notorious hermit kingdom			1
in april this year , @entity36 opened its doors to the world 's media			1
@entity48 was there to cover the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the birth of the country 's founding father , @entity53			1
the eternal president and " @entity53 " had passed power to his " @entity57 " son , the erratic , eccentric @entity57			0
now a third generation @entity59 , the so - called " @entity60 , " stood on the shoulders of his forebears			2
he gained power by birthright , but the world is watching as he attempts to rule in his own right			2
" he is the youngest head of state in the world , " said analyst @entity67			2
" there 's still a lot of debate about how much power he has , whether other family members are in control or the military			2
" reading @entity36 tea leaves his soldiers certainly pay lip service to their loyalty			1
these men are combat ready , never forgetting they have a sworn enemy in the @entity84			0
" with the strategy of the great leader @entity53 , the dear @entity57 and @entity38 with our bombs and weapons we will destroy them , " they tell me			1
but beyond the war rhetoric are the realities of leading an impoverished , isolated and paranoid country			1
as i stood below him at this military parade , my mind wandered to the young @entity59 's thoughts			2
what would have been going through his mind ? we 're told he was educated partly in @entity102 , loves music and western movies and is a huge basketball fan			0
but the country he rules is largely sealed off from the outside world			1
people here mostly do n't have telephones ; they never get exposure to foreign television , newspapers or films			0
the world is defined by endless statues , portraits and tributes to the cult of the @entity119			2
what @entity59 's ' mystery woman ' says about @entity36 when @entity48 visited @entity122 , @entity36 was putting on its most intimidating face			1
but amid this display of what the regime called power and prosperity was the lone voice of the young leader			0
for the first time @entity36 heard him speak			1
this is why he appeared nervous			0
@entity38 mouthed the usual threats and warnings , but there was something different : an acknowledgment that @entity36 must find a better future			1
" our fellow citizens , who are the best citizens in the world , who have overcome countless struggles and hardships , it is our party 's firmest resolve not to let our citizens go hungry again , " he said			1
it was an important , if veiled , concession			0
yes , @entity36 people had suffered			1
yes , the regime was responsible -- not just for the past but a better future			0
" this was really his introduction			0
a few years ago no one even knew he existed but they 're being told to worship him , " @entity67 said			0
our government - assigned minders escorted us around the city			0
they were there to make sure that what we saw and heard was strictly according to the party line			0
in @entity36 it is impossible to separate what is genuine and what is just for show			1
in the streets of the capital , @entity122 , we were given a glimpse of the great future @entity38 was promising			1
we were taken to bustling neighborhoods , saw families shopping , cars on the street			0
but all of this only served to hide another harsher reality			0
outside this showcase city , life was so very different			0
in the bleak countryside , aid groups say people continue to starve			1
defectors tell of surviving on little more than corn			0
children are reportedly malnourished and have stunted growth			0
all the while billions of dollars are still spent on high - tech missiles and nuclear weapons			1
this is the essence of this secretive country			2
@entity38 may struggle to emerge from the shadows of his father and grandfather , but the gun here looms even larger			1
as young and green as he is , he knows this much : without it , his rule and the regime itself will not survive .			0

@entity36 's @entity38 is the third generation of a powerful *dynasty*
beyond war rhetoric are realities of an impoverished , paranoid country
country is largely sealed off from the outside world
aid groups describe starvation , as billions of dollars are spent on weapons
