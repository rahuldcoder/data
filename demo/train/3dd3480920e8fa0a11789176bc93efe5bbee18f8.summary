@entity33 aviation authorities have suggested that the plane ascended despite permission being denied because of traffic			2
some experts have speculated that the aircraft might have experienced an aerodynamic stall because of a lack of speed or from flying at too sharp an angle to get enough lift			2
analysts have also suggested that the pilots might not have been getting information from onboard systems about the plane 's position , or that rain or hail from thunderstorms in the area could have damaged the engines			1
