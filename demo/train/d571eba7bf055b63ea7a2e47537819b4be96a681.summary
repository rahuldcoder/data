airplane travelers will soon be able to watch videos and play games with their electronic devices throughout their entire flight -- and not just above a certain altitude -- the @entity6 said thursday in a long anticipated announcement			1
but do n't expect to be chatting on your cell phone			1
a ban on using cell phones for voice communication remains in effect			1
the @entity6 , following months of study by a group of aviation experts , said that airlines can soon allow passengers to use portable electronic devices such as tablets , laptop computers , e-readers and cell phones in airplane mode throughout the flight -- with some circumstantial restrictions			1
can your cell phone bring down a plane ? until now , passengers in the @entity29 were prohibited from using the devices until their plane rose above 10,000 feet			1
the timing of the changes will depend on individual airlines , but an @entity6 statement said it expects " many carriers will prove to the @entity6 that their planes allow passengers to safely use their devices in airplane mode , gate - to-gate , by the end of the year			1
" " each airline will determine how and when this will happen , " @entity6 administrator @entity43 told reporters at @entity45			2
some fliers admit leaving devices on in flight the periods of flight in question are fairly short			0
the ascent of an aircraft to 10,000 feet usually takes 10 minutes or less , depending on the airport and weather conditions , said @entity57 , a commercial airline pilot and @entity59 blogger			1
@entity60 and @entity61 wasted no time announcing thursday morning that both airlines have filed plans with the @entity6 to allow for use of approved electronic devices below 10,000 feet on their flights			1
both carriers had representatives on the @entity6 advisory panel			2
the @entity6 said thursday afternoon that it had already received plans from some airlines			1
" the agency is reviewing the plans to make sure they conform to the guidance we released a few hours ago , " the @entity6 said			1
" depending on the condition of the plan , we could approve expanded use of electronic devices very soon			0
" the @entity6 also permits the use of in - flight @entity82 service if the airline offers and allows it			2
@entity60 said its service will continue to be available above 10,000 feet			1
the @entity6 had long claimed that using electronic devices during takeoff and landing posed a safety issue and that radio signals from the devices could interfere with an aircraft 's communications , navigation and other systems			1
but a panel the @entity6 established last year to study the issue concluded that most commercial airplanes can tolerate radio interference signals			2
before an airline switches to the relaxed rules , it will have to prove to the @entity6 that its aircraft can tolerate the interference			2
airlines have , over the years , built newer planes with portable electronics in mind , hardening them against electromagnetic interference			0
the @entity6 did outline an exception to the new rule : " in some instances of low visibility -- about one percent of flights -- some landing systems may not be proved @entity115 tolerant , so you may be asked to turn off your device			2
" an airline pilots union that participated in revising the rules voiced support thursday for the requirement that airlines prove their fleet 's tolerance to signal interference , but expressed reservations about traveler compliance			2
" we remain concerned that relying on passengers to selectively turn off their devices in areas of extremely poor weather is not a practical solution , " the @entity127 said in a statement			0
enforcing the policy flight attendants ' hard jobs just got harder , said travel blogger @entity137			0
that 's because they 'll have to ensure that passengers are only using devices in " aircraft safe " mode , not downloading anything from the @entity145			2
" no one turns their devices off anymore , " @entity137 says			0
" i do n't say anything ( to fellow passengers about turning them off ) these days because all the studies have shown that it does n't cause any problems , and the pilots are now using stuff ( @entity155 and other electronic devices ) in the cockpit			0
" the @entity158 expressed some concerns , asking in a statement that testing be streamlined to ensure that " airplanes can tolerate electromagnetic interference " from passenger devices			0
development of crew training and passenger messaging is also needed to ensure passengers pay attention to safety messages from flight attendants , the union said			0
opinion : cell phones on planes ? for texting , not gabbing benefits for travelers , electronics manufacturers it 's no surprise that advocates for the travel and electronics industries cheered the easing of the restrictions on devices during flight			1
" we 're pleased the @entity6 recognizes that an enjoyable passenger experience is not incompatible with safety and security , " @entity187 , @entity188 president and ceo , said in a prepared statement			0
" what 's good for the traveler is good for travel - related businesses and our economy			0
" travel blogger @entity199 said he expects a lot of consumer satisfaction related to the new policy			0
" this is exactly what travelers have wanted , " said @entity199 , the @entity204 columnist , via e-mail			0
" it will , however , mean people have more distracting them from paying attention during the safety briefing , so airlines are going to really have to step up their game to make sure people understand how to be as safe as possible			0
" in early october , the @entity216 announced support for an @entity6 committee recommendation that passengers generally be allowed to use typical lightweight electronic devices at all altitudes of flight on airplanes hardened against radio interference			1
about 69 % of passengers traveling with an e-device reported using their devices on a flight , and almost one - third of passengers admitted to accidentally leaving one on in flight , according to a 2013 @entity232 study .			0

@entity6 says it is reviewing plans it 's received from airlines
air travelers will soon be able to use e-devices below 10,000 feet
airlines are already filing requests to grant passengers that ability
a ban on cell phone calls remains in effect
