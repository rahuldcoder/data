how has life changed for new dad @entity1 ? well , for one , he has n't slept more than two to three consecutive hours since his son , @entity2 , arrived a month ago			1
@entity1 gets up with his wife for overnight feedings			2
" i 'm the baby passer , " he told me during an interview when he could have been sleeping instead			1
when the baby wakes up , @entity1 passes him from the crib to his wife , @entity9 , then takes a cat - nap before burping and rocking the baby to sleep when feeding time is over			1
ok , moms , how many of you are jealous right now ? " i do n't want to make myself sound better than i am because there are certain feedings that after i pass him off , i pass out , " he joked			2
fatherhood has clearly changed from when i grew up and dads were about as likely to wake during the night as they were to actually give birth			1
as even prince @entity22 demonstrated in a recent interview with @entity24 , his first since the birth of his son @entity26 , modern dads are more and more involved and would n't have it any other way			1
@entity24 's @entity29 : tired , elated prince @entity22 could be any new dad but there 's a huge learning curve for first - time dads , which can make them feel clueless even as they jump up to help with the diaper changes and bottle feedings			1
i asked dads to share what surprised , delighted and woke them up in a cold sweat during their first days of parenting			1
the fears in conversations with fathers across the country , a common fear -- during those earliest days -- emerged : how exactly do you handle a newborn ? @entity47 , a father of identical twin boys in @entity49 , @entity50 , said he had never changed a diaper before his kids were born			1
" i just thought i do n't know if i am going to be any good at this , " he said in between yawns			2
( his kids are just 6 months old ! ) " it comes to you pretty quick			2
i was changing diapers with no problem , " he said			2
@entity1 , worried his son might stop breathing , did something i actually still do ( even though my kids are 5 and 7 ! ) : he checked the baby 's chest to make sure he was still breathing			1
prince @entity22 and dads everywhere show ' mr. @entity67 ' is outdated now that he 's tackled that anxiety , and considers himself a " master swaddler , " he can focus on what he calls his " future fears			1
" the founder of a video production company called @entity75 ( we worked together previously during my time at @entity78 ) , @entity1 said the pressure of providing for a new family can be overwhelming and lead to lots of questions			2
" like will i remain gainfully employed and take care of this family ? " he said with a laugh			2
" and then the other , i guess , is just i hope i do n't pass on all my neuroses			0
" some new fathers are a bit more freewheeling			1
@entity88 , a successful @entity89 entrepreneur and proud father of 13 - week - old @entity91 , recently spent five days alone with his daughter while his wife was overseas for work			1
" i was thrilled to tell her ... that the kid has all her fingers , all her toes , " he said , describing his phone conversation with his wife			0
" she 's been in a new outfit every day			0
" @entity88 said he was n't worried at all about going solo , and bases his confidence on the logic that kids have been surviving for years without their parents ' sterilizing bottles and everything else			0
" you do n't have to purell your life away , " he joked			0
drop in sex drive is n't exclusive to mothers go - to gadgets for dads to keep tabs on their little ones , some of the dads i talked with have come up with some , let 's say , unusual approaches			1
@entity88 reached out to friends in the security industry , and installed a device on his daughter 's crib , which sends an alert to his phone when there is any motion above the height of the crib			0
" there is something to be said for having a dad who is a complete geek , " he joked			1
@entity1 is resorting to some more traditional devices , calling the " pee - pee teepee , " which covers the boy 's penis during diaper changes , his " savior			0
" " i 've learned the hard way because definitely at 5 o'clock in the morning , there 'd be a couple of times where i forget to put it on and the next thing i know i feel something warm on my shirt , " he said			0
modern fathers face new expectations work - life balance while we often talk about the " work - life balance " issue as mainly a working mom phenomenon , the dads i spoke with made it clear it 's very much a working father issue as well			1
@entity163 of @entity164 , @entity165 , whose little girl @entity166 is about to be 3 months old , said the biggest stressor of being a dad is " finding that way to balance career and fatherhood			1
" certain times of the year , he said , his job as an operations manager for a company providing online curriculums to schools requires a 70 + hour workweek			0
" traditionally , the father is the provider , but also now , you couple that with the additional societal expectation that they 're more involved in the child - rearing , so what 's going to give ? " he wondered			2
photos : bored dads at @entity190 concert dads : forgotten piece of the puzzle ? every father i spoke with said he did more of the child care -- and the housework -- than his dad and his grandfather did			1
" my dad never changed my diaper , i do n't think , and never really did much of the housework to help @entity67 out , " said @entity163			2
" i 'm doing those things ... and i do n't think i 'm unusual in that respect , either			0
" @entity1 said that when older family friends come to visit , he thinks they 're probably a bit surprised			0
" because i am the one changing the diapers and burping the baby and i know it 's totally different for them , " he said			2
" it 's evolution in a very good way			0
" with everything dads are doing now , i wondered if we give them enough credit -- we being society in general , moms , media , etc. no more dumb old dad : changing the bumbling dad stereotype @entity88 said he gets frustrated at the portrayal of dads as clueless and uninvolved			1
he said he once received what he called a " dad - proof onesie " complete with instructions on the clothing for where the arms and feet go			2
" are you freakin ' kidding me ? " he said			0
@entity47 said people often focus on how the baby is doing and how the mom is , and said while that makes sense physically , the emotional effects of parenthood on dads might get overlooked			1
" i had a friend of mine who told me when these babies are born , no one is going to ask you how you 're doing , so i 'm going to make sure that i do , " he said as he fought another yawn			0
" and he 's right , because i do think that happens a bit			0
" how life has changed in his interview with @entity24 , prince @entity22 said a lot of things affect him differently now that he 's a dad , and all the fathers i spoke with could completely relate			1
" the babies have given me sort of a sense there is something bigger than work , " said @entity47 , who works long hours as an attorney in a big law firm			0
" when i come home and i 'm stressed and you see those two and you see the faces , you realize that it 's just work , so i do think it changes everything			0
" it changes everything , indeed , including how little time you now have for each other , said @entity163			0
he and his wife used to enjoy a date night every friday but that went away when @entity166 was born			0
" that 's an adjustment , but the reward is better , " he said			0
