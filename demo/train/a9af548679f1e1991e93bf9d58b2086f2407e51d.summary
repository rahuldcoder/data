-- @entity2 's hopes of snapping a 52 - year title drought in @entity4 were revived by a stunning late winner from substitute @entity6 in a 2 - 1 victory over @entity9 giants @entity8 in @entity10 thursday			1
his sublime 84th minute strike left @entity12 clutching at fresh air to leave @entity8 with work to do in the second leg of the @entity17 semifinal in @entity18 next week			1
the @entity20 champions had looked to be in control when @entity22 scored his first goal in @entity4 competition for five years to level the match at 1 - 1 late in the second half			1
but @entity2 's top scorer @entity30 , on target twice as his side wrapped up their 33rd @entity32 title at the weekend , had other ideas as he converted from @entity35 's pass			2
in a frantic finale , @entity36 was twice denied by home goalkeeper @entity38 and @entity2 might have also added to their tally			0
@entity41 headed home from a cross by @entity44 to put @entity2 ahead after only two minutes , but @entity8 came more into the match after the early setback and highly - rated @entity47 might have leveled before @entity22 struck			2
the @entity49 star , who has plied his trade at both @entity51 and @entity52 , was played through by @entity53 and slid the ball under @entity55 for a vital away goal			0
@entity2 have not won a major trophy since winning the old @entity58 in 1962 , despite playing in seven finals in various competitions since , beaten by @entity61 in the title match of the @entity17 last year			1
by legend , the reason for their failure is a ' curse ' placed on the side by former coach @entity69 , who guided them to that last success then left over an unpaid bonus , vowing that they would never taste the same success for 100 years			0
@entity75 wins over @entity77 @entity76 and @entity79 side @entity78 had left @entity2 with the opportunity to reach another final , but @entity8 have the incentive of a possible title match in their home @entity84 on may 14			0
the @entity20 giants have also waited a long time for a trophy on the @entity4 stage , having not triumphed since winning the @entity58 in 1996			0
the other semifinal is an all - @entity91 affair and in - form @entity92 beat @entity93 2 - 0 thanks to two goals in just three minutes in the first half			1
@entity97 and @entity98 scored for the home side , who have won 13 of their last 16 games , including a victory over @entity103 .			0
