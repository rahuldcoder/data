-- @entity1 cashed out just in time			1
@entity1 sold @entity2 , his portfolio of @entity5 applications , for seven figures in april			1
the 26 - year - old , a former @entity8 employee who helped put together the @entity10 product , founded a company called @entity2 within months of the debut of @entity5 's developer platform in may 2007			1
@entity2 is a portfolio of @entity5 applications , and a few of them , like @entity18 , became genuine viral hits			1
in april , @entity1 sold the 12 - employee @entity20 to the @entity21 , a @entity23 company backed by the likes of @entity25 , the @entity26 , and @entity27			1
he said the price was in the seven figures			0
but @entity1 is the first to acknowledge that for upstart social - platform developers , hailed just months ago as the @entity23 's hottest breed of bright young things , the condition has taken a significant turn for the worse			1
" most people are not counting on anything , " the lanky and bespectacled @entity1 said over lunch at an organic restaurant near @entity38 's @entity37 in early december			1
" they 're just operating from day to day			0
" when @entity5 's developer platform launched , the social network 's traffic began to really skyrocket			1
what had started as a no - frills networking site for students at elite universities became a @entity23 buzz factory with legitimate geek credentials			1
and however gimmicky many of the most popular @entity52 apps were , millions of people decided they now had a reason to join the site			0
when other social networks such as @entity60 , @entity61 , and @entity62 also paraded out developer platforms , the tech world took it as evidence that there was a big future in building platform applications			1
more importantly for developers and ambitious tech entrepreneurs , it looked like there could be gobs of money in it ; the open , anyone - can - play attitude created the notion that there was enough for everyone			1
" the social platform ( on @entity5 ) actually launched the last day that i was at @entity8 ... i was quitting without any idea of what i was going to do , " @entity1 recalled			1
his aims for leaving @entity86 were starry - eyed			0
" i left because i wanted to do a start - up			0
i wanted to see what i could do out there on my own			0
and i wanted to care deeply about what i was working on			0
" but he had no concrete plans to go the @entity5 route initially , he said			2
" i ended up in my parents ' house in @entity96 and was kind of bored , and started building @entity5 apps just out of restlessness and the desire to do something			1
" then , @entity1 continued , he went to the @entity102 conference in @entity103 in march and met @entity21 founder @entity104			2
at the time , he was looking to raise venture funding but had n't thought about selling his apps			0
" we talked for 30 minutes and he was like , ' you sound like the exact type of people we want at @entity21			0
' " @entity1 sold @entity2 to @entity104 's company the next month			1
widgets buzz turns into hush @entity1 got lucky			2
even before the reality of the recession set in , the social - platform craze was subsiding			1
the venture capital buzz about widgets began to quiet over the summer			0
some of the sillier novelty apps wore off in popularity			0
companies that were snapping up small apps and raising huge amounts of venture capital , like @entity125 and @entity126 , grew intimidatingly bigger -- but the glut of independent apps made it more difficult to grab the attention of potential buyers			0
and after new restrictions , a redesign , and then the social network 's focus on expanding through its @entity138 log - in service , it became evident that a social - network platform is still a new phenomenon that can change dramatically , and not always to the benefit of little start - ups			1
" there 's definitely a lot of tightening up , " @entity1 said			2
" there 's a few people that i know that have apps that are relatively small , and they 're selling them for valuations lower than what they could 've sold them for a month ago , and there are just no buyers in the marketplace			2
i think they 're going to have a hard time selling , period -- forget trying to sell at a lower valuation			0
they 're just having a hard time getting rid of them			0
" so would he still be able to sell his company as easily now ? " no , probably not , " @entity1 admitted			1
" if we were the same company we were then , it would be much harder to sell today			0
i think we would 've had to evolve as a company			0
i think we would need to be generating more revenue than we were			0
" but for all his concern about the fate of social - platform developers in a recession , @entity1 is still strikingly bullish on @entity5 -- enough so that his newest project is a fund for @entity5 stock			1
he started purchasing it in november , he said , and is meeting with investors in the hopes of purchasing more			0
he added with surprising gusto that @entity5 's decision to delay direct cash - outs has n't derailed his plan			1
" i think that 's actually good news for us , " @entity1 said			2
" i think that means that the price that we pay will actually go down because there are all these employees who intended to sell stock back to @entity5 , and now they 're not going to be able to sell it to @entity5 , ( so ) they 'll have to sell it somewhere else			2
" he hopes to keep the stock until @entity5 files for an initial public offering , and he still thinks that 's on track , too			2
" i think it 's going to be a function of the economy and when the markets open back up for an ipo , " he said , and cited target dates that had been provided in interviews by @entity5 investor and board member @entity200			2
" from a @entity5 perspective , i think it 'll be ready to ipo in 2011			2
" many critics would say that 's wishful thinking , and that the company will sell -- to existing investor @entity8 , maybe -- for much lower than its $ 15 billion preferred - stock valuation			0
but @entity1 got lucky on @entity5 once already , and even in a recession he has n't given up hope that it could happen again			1
