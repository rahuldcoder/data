the @entity0 is making another attempt at regulating electronic cigarettes and other tobacco products			1
on thursday , the agency proposed rules that call for strict regulation of electronic cigarettes , cigars , pipe tobacco , nicotine gels , water pipe tobacco and hookahs			1
currently , only cigarettes , smokeless tobacco and roll - your - own tobacco come under the @entity0 's regulatory authority			1
when these recommendations are finalized following a 75 - day public comment period , the age limit to buy the products is expected to be at least 18 , although individual states could choose to set it higher			1
health warnings would also be required , and the sale of the products in vending machines would be prohibited			0
initially , the only health warning required for e-cigarettes would be about the potential for addiction to nicotine			1
manufacturers would be required to register all their products and ingredients with the @entity0			1
they would be able to market new products only after an @entity0 review , and they would need to provide scientific evidence before making any direct or implied claims of risk reduction associated with their product			1
companies would also no longer be allowed to give out free samples			0
after the public comment period , and once the proposed rules are finalized , manufacturers will have 24 months to submit applications to allow their products to remain on the market or to submit new product applications			2
e-cigarettes deliver nicotine to the user as a vapor			1
they are usually battery - operated and come with a replaceable cartridge that contains liquid nicotine			2
when heated , the liquid in the cartridge turns into a vapor that 's inhaled			2
most look like cigarettes , cigars or pipes , but some resemble pens or usb memory sticks			2
because they have not been fully studied , the @entity0 says it 's unknown what health risks they pose , how much nicotine or other chemicals are actually being inhaled , or whether there is any benefit to using them			1
last year , the @entity74 reported that the percentage of high school students who reported ever using an e-cigarette more than doubled in one year , from 4.7 % to 10 % between 2011 and 2012			0
as electronic cigarettes have increased in popularity , so have the number of related calls to poison control centers nationwide			2
according to a recent @entity74 report , poison control centers logged 215 calls involving e-cigarettes in february alone			2
of those calls , 51 % involved children			0
" it 's really the wild , wild west out there , " said @entity89 , @entity0 commissioner			1
" because e-cigarettes are increasingly in the marketplace			2
they 're coming in different sizes , shapes and flavors in terms of the nicotine in them , and there 's very worrisome data that show that young people in particular are starting to take up e-cigarettes , especially the flavored ones -- and that might be a gateway to other harmful tobacco products			1
" @entity109 said officials do n't know how many types are on the market , another reason why regulation is critical			0
" we 're already conducting research and working with partners in the research community to better understand patterns of use of these e-cigarettes and to learn more about the way in which they work and the delivery of the nicotine through e-cigarettes			1
but until we can really regulate them , we ca n't have all the information we need and we ca n't take all the actions that we might want to , to be able to best address the public health issues associated with them			0
" @entity131 , president of @entity132 -- considered the second - largest electronic cigarette company in the @entity134 -- said he is encouraged by the @entity0 announcement			1
" we look forward to being a part of this process and believe that science - based and responsible regulations are good for both adult consumers and responsible electronic cigarette manufacturers , " @entity131 said			0
@entity141 opened its doors in 2010			0
the company has nine products on the market , both disposable and rechargeable , but no flavored nicotine products			2
logic implemented rules a year ago similar to the ones the @entity0 has proposed			1
" we support and have already implemented those steps to ensure that adult smokers are the audience and consumer base of our products , " @entity131 said			0
" we work with the retailers to ensure the product is sold to adult consumers of legal smoking age			2
" experts have said that e-cigarettes , if properly regulated , could help reduce the number of people who use conventional cigarettes and die of tobacco - related disease			1
but a lot of unanswered questions remain , according to @entity167 , dean of the @entity168 at @entity169 , one of 14 @entity134 institutions conducting @entity0 - funded research on electronic cigarettes			1
nicotine is a drug , and poison experts say the concentrated liquid form used in e-cigarettes is highly toxic , even in small doses			1
it can be inhaled or absorbed through the skin			0
" how concentrated is liquid nicotine ? are there impurities in it ? is it properly handled like a pesticide ? " @entity167 asks			0
" @entity188 is a pesticide , fundamentally , and we take so many precautions about pesticides for our lawns and how to wear gloves			0
but what precautions do consumers take when they put the nicotine vials in ? people treat it ( liquid nicotine ) as sugar when it 's a toxin			0
" @entity203 , president and ceo of the @entity205 , believes nicotine is highly addictive whether used in a regular cigarette or an e-cigarette			0
so how safe are e-cigarettes ? @entity109 said it 's buyer beware			0
" we think that there 's a lot of information that needs to be understood about e-cigarettes and their use			0
we 're trying to help provide some of that information through research that we 're conducting , " she said			0
" but we need the tools that regulation provides to be able to get critical new knowledge about e-cigarettes and to be able to put in place a framework that will protect the @entity134 public and potentially e-cigarette users , and really address the issues of what are the health consequences and what are the potential benefits			0
" @entity109 believes these new rules will change the landscape			0
if the @entity0 broadens its authority to regulate tobacco products , she said , it will make a major contribution to the health of @entity134			1
but big changes could come slowly			0
" it may be years before much regulation is imposed , " said @entity241 , a law professor at the @entity242			0
" the lobbying at @entity0 and @entity246 will be intense			1
" and some believe the @entity0 has already waited too long			1
" it is inexcusable that it has taken the @entity0 and the @entity253 so long to act , " @entity248 , president of the @entity249 , said in a statement			1
" this delay has had serious public health consequences as these unregulated tobacco products have been marketed using tactics and sweet flavors that appeal to kids , and their use has skyrocketed			0
" the @entity0 and the @entity253 must now move as quickly as possible to finalize this rule			2
