nearly five months ago , president @entity0 spoke to the nation from the @entity3 and declared : " our objective is clear			1
we will degrade , and ultimately destroy , @entity5 ( also known as @entity5 ) through a comprehensive and sustained counterterrorism strategy			1
" since then , the @entity7 has provided advisers to the @entity10 military in its fight with @entity5 and has bombed @entity5 positions			1
but in an interview with @entity1 last week , outgoing defense secretary @entity13 raised the prospect that the @entity7 might need to expand its involvement			1
this week , @entity5 has again dominated headlines and tv news coverage around the world with the release of a video allegedly showing @entity23 pilot @entity22 being burned alive after being captured by the group			2
this followed shortly after the apparent killing of two @entity28 hostages			0
all of which raises the question : how is @entity5 doing as it confronts the @entity7 - led military campaign against it in both @entity10 and @entity32 ? and should the @entity7 get more actively involved on the front lines of the fight , at least in @entity10 , where the government is pushing for greater @entity7 involvement in its fight against @entity5 ? @entity7 officials assert the coalition has killed more than 6,000 @entity5 fighters since the start of the campaign			1
that 's a significant loss when you consider that @entity5 currently has a core force of 9,000 to 18,000 fighters , according to @entity7 intelligence estimates			1
@entity7 officials also estimate that @entity5 can also draw on manpower from other militant groups to bulk up to a force of around 30,000			1
gen , @entity52 , the commander of @entity53 who oversees the campaign against @entity5 , said last week that as a result of the campaign of airstrikes the group is developing a " manpower issue			2
" balanced against this , however , is the fact @entity5 continues to recruit at a fast clip			2
in october , @entity7 officials estimated that there were around 1,000 recruits joining @entity5 per month from overseas			1
underlining the importance of that steady flow of @entity5 recruits , the head of @entity7 @entity67 , gen. @entity68 , said last week that since the @entity32 war began over three years ago , " more than 19,000 foreign fighters from 90 different countries have traveled to @entity32 and @entity10			1
" so if the @entity53 campaign is killing around 1,200 @entity5 fighters a month and yet @entity5 continues -- at least for the moment -- to recruit an estimated 1,000 fighters from overseas a month , the campaign against them has succeeded only to a modest degree			2
@entity82 told @entity1 's @entity83 last week it might be necessary to send noncombat @entity7 troops to help @entity10 troops on the front lines to fight @entity5			1
" we have to look at all the options , and i think it may require a forward deployment of some of our troops -- not doing the fighting , not doing the combat work that we did at one time for six years in @entity10 and we did for many , many years in @entity97 , but to help airstrike precision ( locate targets ) , " he told @entity83			0
indeed , the introduction of @entity7 forward air controllers to call in precise @entity7 airstrikes and of @entity103 embedded with @entity10 units on the front lines will ultimately be necessary if the goal of @entity7 policy is to defeat @entity5 , rather than simply playing for a draw with the group , which is , de facto , the current @entity0 administration policy			1
on friday , @entity5 launched a surprise attack on @entity112 in northern @entity10 , the largely @entity113 city that is a key to @entity10 's oil production			2
the attack appears to be a strategic decision meant to draw @entity113 fighters away from @entity119 , @entity5 's overall base in @entity10			2
@entity5 has controlled @entity119 , @entity10 's second largest city , since june , but in the past month , @entity113 forces have closed in around it			2
@entity113 authorities said last week that they 've cut a key supply line to @entity5 in @entity119 and have taken back some 300 square miles of land around the city from the group			2
beyond the @entity119 area , @entity5 has lost ground in @entity10 elsewhere			2
the @entity10 army pushed the group out of @entity133 province , an important region close to @entity135 as well as more than 1,000 square miles in the @entity137 region in eastern @entity10			0
further , a number of @entity5 's leaders have been killed in @entity7 airstrikes			1
and in @entity32 last week , @entity5 lost control of @entity142 , a small town on the @entity32 - @entity145 border where many of the @entity7 - led airstrikes have been concentrated			1
but overall , @entity5 is maintaining its ground in @entity32 in spite of those airstrikes			0
at least one - third of @entity32 is under @entity5 's control			0
a number of estimates suggest that @entity5 controls a population of around 8 million people in @entity10 and @entity32			1
@entity5 calls itself the @entity155 and while this may seem a tad pretentious it makes more sense when you realize the group presently lords over a population around the size of the population of @entity164			0
militants gain new allies despite setbacks at the same time , @entity5 's influence keeps growing around the @entity170 world			0
in the past six months , @entity5 has drawn into its fold some dozen militant groups from @entity173 to @entity174			1
these affiliates are n't wasting any time in carrying out attacks in the name of @entity5			0
on january 27 , gunmen claiming to be affiliated with @entity5 attacked the @entity179 in @entity180 , @entity181 , which is favored by government officials and foreigners			0
they killed 10 people after storming into the lobby and firing guns at hotel guests			0
five of the victims were foreigners , one an @entity7			0
two days later , at least 32 people were killed in a series of attacks on soldiers and police in @entity196 in eastern @entity197			0
the terrorist group known as the @entity199 of @entity196 has claimed responsibility for the attacks and had pledged allegiance to @entity5 in november			1
@entity5 has recently claimed even more recruits , as it moved into new territory in @entity205 , competing there with @entity206 ( @entity206 )			1
a @entity205 official who spoke to @entity1 in january said that the @entity206 cadre still significantly outnumbers those in @entity5 , but the move into @entity205 is significant for the group as it a country where @entity206 has maintained a presence for more than a decade			0
similarly , in @entity97 in the southern province of @entity215 , a cell of more than 300 fighters loyal to @entity5 is led by a former @entity219 commander , mullah @entity218			0
militant groups across the @entity170 world see the success @entity5 has had so far in @entity32 and @entity10 and opt to join it -- often leaving behind organizations plagued by infighting			0
the perks they get in return for waving the black flag of @entity5 include affiliation with the fastest - growing terrorist group on the planet and a bustling propaganda machine with a strong social media network			0
from @entity97 to @entity181 , militant groups who once would have looked to @entity206 for guidance now look to @entity5			0
the best way to begin to reverse this is to cripple @entity5 in @entity10 , where the group has shown itself to be the most adept terrorist group of the modern era , taking control of cities like @entity119 , whose population numbers 1.5 million people			0
urban warfare is the hardest kind of warfare and it 's hard to imagine that the @entity10 army and @entity113 forces will successfully pull off retaking @entity119 on their own			0
winning @entity119 back from @entity5 will be much more likely if the there are @entity7 air controllers calling in close air support strikes against @entity5 positions and @entity103 working side by side with @entity10 units			1
of course , there are risks associated with this			0
@entity7 troops may be killed or injured , but there are also risks associated with the fact that the longer @entity5 controls vast swaths of the @entity267 , more and more foreign fighters will pour in from @entity270 countries for training with the group and some will seek to bring their skills home to attack the @entity275 .			1

@entity277 : five months after @entity0 pledged to destroy @entity5 , it still controls large territory and attracts support .
he says @entity13 may be right , that @entity7 military may need to be near front lines
