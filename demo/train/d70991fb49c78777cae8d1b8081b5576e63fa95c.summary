-- scientists say they " serendipitously " discovered that a drug used to treat a type of cancer quickly reversed @entity6 's disease in mice			1
" it 's really exciting , " said @entity8 , senior director for medical and scientific relations for the @entity10			0
" they saw very positive and robust behavior effects in the mice			1
" in the study , researchers at @entity16 gave mice mega-doses of bexarotene , a drug used to treat a type of skin cancer called cutaneous t - cell lymphoma			2
within 72 hours , the mice showed dramatic improvements in memory and more than 50 % of amyloid plaque -- a hallmark of alzheimer 's disease -- had been removed from the brain			2
the study was published thursday in the journal @entity33			0
@entity34 , the lead researcher at @entity16 , cautioned that even though his results were impressive in mice , it may turn out not to work in people			1
" i want to say as loudly and clearly as possible that this was a study in mice , not in humans , " he said			2
" we 've fixed @entity6 's in mice lots of times , so we need to move forward expeditiously but cautiously			1
" mice -- and humans -- with @entity6 's have high levels of a substance called amyloid beta in their brain			1
pathology tests on the mice showed bexarotene lowered the levels of amyloid beta and raised the levels of @entity57 , which helps keep amyloid beta levels low			0
@entity34 said he hopes to try the drug out in healthy humans within two months , to see if it has the same effect			2
those participating in the trial would be given the standard dose that cancer patients are usually given			0
researchers tested the memories of mice with @entity6 's both before and after giving them bexarotene			1
for example , the @entity6 's mice walked right into a cage where they 'd previously been given a painful electrical shock , but after treatment with bexarotene , the mice remembered the shock and refused to enter the cage			1
in another test , the scientists put tissue paper in a cage			0
normal mice instinctively use tissues in their cage to make a nest , but mice with @entity6 's ca n't figure out what to do with the tissues			1
after treatment with the drug , the @entity6 's mice made a nest with the paper			1
@entity96 said one of the major advantages of bexarotene is that it 's already been approved by the @entity101 for use in humans , which means the researchers can move into human trials sooner than if it were a completely new drug			2
the @entity10 is funding @entity16 's next phase of research , which will involve using bexarotene at the levels used on cancer patients , @entity34 said			0
since the drug does have some side effects -- it can increase cholesterol , for example -- he hopes to use it in even lower levels as the study goes on			0
@entity34 said his lab had been working on other drugs for @entity6 's for 10 years when a graduate student , @entity121 , decided to try bexarotene , which works on a receptor involved in amyloid beta clearance			1
some other drugs that worked in mice were too toxic to use in humans			0
" we 're really lucky that bexarotene is a great drug with an acceptable safety profile , " he said			0
" this does n't happen very many times in life ' " @entity0 's @entity132 contributed to this report .			0

" they saw very positive and robust *...* effects in the mice , " an @entity6 's *official* says
researchers found improvements in mice 's memories after they got the drug
the lead researcher cautions that not all good results in mice are seen in humans
