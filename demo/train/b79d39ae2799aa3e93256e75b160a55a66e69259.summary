@entity0 -- @entity6 military exercises near @entity7 are raising concerns that @entity9 may be putting troops in position to move across the border if such orders are issued , a senior @entity3 official familiar with the most recent administration assessment told @entity1 thursday			1
but the @entity3 still believes that @entity6 does n't plan to order its forces into its tumultuous neighbor , the official said on the condition of anonymity			1
@entity3 officials -- who are monitoring the area 24 hours a day -- have not yet seen signs that @entity6 is preparing to secure supply and transportation routes that would be crucial to any such movement , the official said			1
@entity6 military activity levels observed by the @entity3 also " appear to be within normal range , " the official said			1
@entity6 foreign minister @entity26 offered reassurances thursday to @entity3 secretary of state @entity28 that the exercises were previously planned and were not being carried out because of the upheaval in @entity7 , echoing an earlier conversation between @entity3 president @entity32 and @entity6 president @entity33			1
the @entity34 has said the combat readiness evaluation is being carried out in territory overseen by the western and central military commands			0
that puts some of the exercises near the @entity7 border			0
" all in all , about 150 thousand military personnel of different services of the armed forces and military commands are involved in the check , " @entity6 defense minister @entity41 said in a statement released by the ministry			2
" up to 90 planes , more than 120 helicopters , up to 880 tanks , over 1,200 defense equipment units and about 80 ships will be used			0
" @entity3 defense secretary @entity54 told reporters thursday in @entity56 , @entity57 , where he was meeting with @entity59 defense ministers , that the @entity3 was following the developments in and around the @entity7			1
" until we really know more details -- what 's really happening there , who is in charge , i think the focus should be ... let 's keep the tensions down			0
let 's see no provocative actions by anyone , any military , " he said			2
one concern is that with @entity6 troops out of their garrisons near @entity7 , they could be in a position to move swiftly across the border -- leaving little time for @entity3 officials to try to mount diplomatic efforts to stop them , the official said			1
but , for now , @entity3 officials believe @entity33 is using the hastily ordered exercises only as a message to @entity3 and @entity7 officials that he has the ability to move his military into @entity7 to protect @entity6 interests if he chooses to , the official said			1
@entity6 has significant interests in @entity7			0
not only does it neighbor @entity7 , the two countries are major trading partners			0
many ethnic @entity6 live in @entity7 's east , and @entity6 has a major military base at @entity95 , @entity7			2
@entity6 officials have complained that opposition figures who have taken control of @entity7 's government are threatening @entity100 @entity7			2
the @entity3 is reviewing @entity6 tactics in its 2008 move into @entity103 for clues about how @entity9 might act in this instance			2
in that incident , @entity6 forces fought troops from @entity103 in a brief conflict that followed @entity6 promises to defend @entity6 citizens in the restive @entity103 province of @entity113			0
@entity3 officials worry about a repeat of that incident , in which both sides perceived provocative actions and @entity6 finally moved in on a large scale			1
any military intervention by @entity6 would be a " grave mistake , " @entity28 warned wednesday			0
" for a country that has spoken out so frequently in the last year ... against foreign intervention in @entity124 , @entity125 , elsewhere , it would be important for them to heed those warnings as they think about options in the sovereign nation of @entity7 , " he said			0
@entity1 's @entity130 and @entity131 contributed to this report from @entity133 .			0
