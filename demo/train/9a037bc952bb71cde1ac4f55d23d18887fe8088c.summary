the international force has been there since 2001 , shortly after the @entity58 attacks on the @entity12 on september 11			0

how long are they there for ? in june 2011 , @entity12 president @entity69 announced that @entity12 combat operations in @entity3 would end by 2014			2

in february this year , @entity12 defense secretary @entity77 announced the @entity12 hoped to end its combat mission in @entity3 in 2013 , transitioning primarily to a training role as @entity3 forces take more responsibility for security			1

how well trained are @entity3 security forces ? the @entity3 forces who fought off an 18 - hour multi-pronged @entity60 attack in @entity8 earlier this week are some of the best trained in the country , according to analysts			1
the crisis response group is based in the capital and has received training from @entity12 special forces			0
@entity3 forces repel attacks " that would be the equal of any other unit of its type in the region , " said @entity119 , a military associate at the @entity120 in @entity121			1
" it 's got it own intelligence assets , which it did n't have three years ago			0
they 've got their own @entity3 aviation assets , helicopters , that can respond to these kind of events			2
so yes , they are getting better at responding to high - profile events in @entity8 -- but the @entity60 are getting better as well			0
" this latter point is picked up by other analysts			0
" i think there has to be a real question mark over the long - term prospects for @entity3 , " said @entity140 , of the @entity141			0
" i think there are some reasons to be cautiously optimistic over the ability of @entity3 forces			2
but ultimately the future of @entity3 will be determined by the factions inside @entity3			0
i think if the last 10 years has shown us anything , then the ability of the outside world to influence the future of @entity3 in the long term is fairly minimal			0

the @entity3 leader is expected to announce that a third tranche of provinces will be handed back to full @entity3 control , including @entity167 , where most of the @entity24 troops are based			1
a clearer split of financial contributions may also emerge at the summit , with the annual cost of funding the @entity3 security forces after 2014 estimated to be $ 4.1 billion			1
" the @entity12 will probably pay a big part of that and i think the @entity53 will also chip in , " said @entity119			0
" you may not see much from the @entity177			0
but there might be some funding commitments from @entity181 , " he added .			0
