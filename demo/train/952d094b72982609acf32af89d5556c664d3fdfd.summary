when no one wanted to build the world 's tallest and fastest water slide , @entity0 built it himself			1
so when @entity7 was completed , and it was time to test the 168 - foot coaster in his @entity11 , @entity12 , water park , the choice of test riders was rather easy			1
the guinea pigs : @entity0 , owner of @entity14 ; @entity0 's assistant ; and head designer @entity16			1
" it was terrifying , " @entity16 said			1
" it was great fun , but it was actually terrifying			1
" the slide finally opened to the public on thursday , july 10 , after several weeks of delays			1
technical glitches forced the original may 23 opening date to be pushed back three times , a park spokesperson said			0
officially certified by @entity28 in may , @entity7 -- which is @entity29 for " insane " -- is 5 feet taller than the previous record holder , a water slide at a @entity33 country club			1
@entity7 is precisely 168 feet 7 inches tall			2
to put that free fall in perspective , it 's longer than a plunge at @entity38			1
@entity16 stressed , however , that the ride is more than a single drop , calling it an " extreme thrill " without comparison			0
" you have three or four experiences on the ride , " he said			0
" there is a 3 - second free fall before you get launched into a weightless situation for a few seconds , and then you come down like a roller coaster and have a long splash down			2
" the origins of @entity7 are as extreme as the ride itself			0
according to @entity16 , owner @entity0 was at a trade show and simply decided he wanted to build the tallest , fastest water slide at one of his five @entity60 water parks			1
he immediately shopped the idea to vendors , who declined , but he refused to be denied			0
" he decided to build it himself , " @entity16 said			0
" we have long experience in building water park rides and developing new technology			2
our park in @entity11 does n't have a height restriction so we decided to put it right here			1
" top 10 @entity72 water parks making a splash officials say top speeds on @entity7 will reach 40 - 50 miles per hour , slightly slower than originally anticipated			1
the ride 's rafts have also been scaled back from four - person rafts to three - person rafts			1
" we always ride our rides first , " @entity16 said			0
" and we found out it was too steep and too short			0
so we were able to redesign it from what we learned			0
we tore down two - thirds of the slide and rebuilt it into the design we have now			1
" " it would have been relatively easy to do ( just one drop ) a long run - out , but to shoot you back over another hill was extremely challenging , " @entity16 said			2
@entity93 is already home to the @entity95 , an uphill water coaster over 1,000 feet in length			2
@entity7 combines that uphill excitement with the thrills of a true water slide			1
if you 're brave , hop on the raft and take the plunge			2
@entity16 is confident the new ride will attract thrill seekers from across the world			0
" we have multiple volunteers to be the first to ride it , " he said			0
" roller coaster enthusiasts will have to try it ... it has a great potential draw			2
" and there 's one more issue : the stairs			0
the climb is " pretty challenging , " @entity16 said			0
" i think its ( about ) 260 steps to get to the top			0
" that 's about 17 stories .			0

@entity125 's tallest water slide to open in @entity11 , @entity12
