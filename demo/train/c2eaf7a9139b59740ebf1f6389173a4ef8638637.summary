-- after seven months of an aerial bombing campaign that helped depose @entity3 , @entity1 said friday it was ending its mission in @entity5 next week			1

" today , we confirmed the decision taken by the @entity15 a week ago , " said @entity1 secretary - general @entity12			2
" our operation for @entity5 will end on october 31			1
until then , together with our partners , we will continue to monitor the situation			0

" but for the @entity26 , and , i think , for the @entity9 @entity8 , this closes what i think history will judge to be a proud chapter in the @entity8 's history			2
" @entity54 foreign secretary @entity53 described the @entity8 passage of @entity56 as " another significant milestone towards a peaceful , democratic future for @entity5			1
ending the no - fly zone and the civilian protection provisions demonstrates that @entity5 has entered a new era			2

" now we will wait and see if the @entity64 is a judicial system which is independent and impartial , " he added			0
@entity1 's @entity5 campaign began in march , after the @entity8 adopted @entity101 , which imposed a no - fly zone in the country 's airspace and authorized member states to take measures to protect civilians			1
meanwhile , @entity26 officials announced plans to transport 30 seriously wounded @entity5 fighters saturday to @entity26 hospitals in @entity112 and @entity113			0
