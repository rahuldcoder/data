the 26 - year - old headed home @entity10 's @entity9 and @entity11 of @entity12 to secure his second maximum - points haul this season and the 16th of his career			1
the @entity17 trails world champion and current standings leader @entity18 of @entity12 by 82 points , and is fourth in the drivers ' championship , but @entity1 is confident he is back in contention for the title he claimed in 2008			1
" the fight for the world championship will be very , very , very hard now , " @entity1 , who started the race second on the grid behind the @entity26 , told @entity2 's official website			1
@entity1 reigns in @entity7 " we 're back in the fight though , and i really hope we can carry this forward and keep the momentum going			2
" @entity1 spent large parts of the @entity36 race battling at close quarters with both @entity11 and the @entity38 @entity9 , and he felt the intense competition helped him to perform at his best			2
" driving lap after lap within tenths of each other was about trying to do everything as perfectly as possible -- yet , being aggressive yet controlled , i felt the moves i made were some of the most precise i 've ever pulled off			0
passing judgment : @entity1 must stay aggressive " being able to drive with your head as well as your heart , and getting it just right , is massively satisfying			0
" @entity18 , 24 , endured his lowest finish of the season so far and only secured fourth after he overtook @entity9 's teammate @entity54 in the pit lane heading into the final lap. it was the first time the @entity7 had finished outside of the top two this season , but @entity18 still holds a 77 - point lead over second - placed @entity11			1
" we 've seen how fast things can change and it is still a long way to go to the final checkered flag , " @entity18 told the sport 's official website			2
latest f1 standings after @entity7 @entity6 " what this weekend has taught me is how fast your race can get spoiled			1
i definitely hope that the next race will be business as usual			0
" of course i would have wanted to please my home crowd			0
i have seen so many fans in @entity12 colors , so of course i would have wanted to win here to see them cheer for me			0
" the next stop on @entity82 's world tour is sunday 's @entity83 in @entity84 , where @entity1 hopes to keep up his momentum			1
@entity11 won at the @entity86 last year from @entity9 and @entity18 , while @entity1 failed to finish			2
" we are only in the middle of the season and so many points are still waiting to be taken , " @entity1 told the @entity82 website			1
" if you look at the results from last year the @entity92 were light years ahead of everyone			0
and if you go back a month to @entity98 , the @entity92 and @entity10 were massively quick in the hot conditions , so i expect them to do the same in @entity101			0
but we will try to improve			0
