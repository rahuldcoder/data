-- floating wind farms could soon be powering thousands of @entity3 homes after a prototype seaborne turbine sailed through technological trials off the coast of @entity7 , @entity8			1
the 54 - meter tall renewable structure sits atop a semi-submersible platform known as a @entity11 situated five kilometers from shore			1
it has been manufactured by @entity14 , a consortium of energy and clean - tech companies including @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			1
the group hopes their primary success will help secure @entity23 funding to add another five turbines alongside the existing model , engendering greater electrical production			0
" the ( initial ) turbine is capable of producing @entity31 ( megawatts ) instantaneously at any one time , given enough wind , " says @entity27 , ceo of @entity28			1
" this is equivalent to 1,300 households			1
the cumulative production thus far in @entity8 has been @entity37 ( gigawatt hours ) , " she adds			0
see also : wind turbine creates water from thin air unlike existing offshore wind farms and underwater tidal turbines , floating structures do not have to be permanently fixed to the ocean floor			1
instead they are kept in place by a drag embedment anchor , much like the devices used to moor oil rigs in deep ocean environments			2
this means @entity53 structures could theoretically be transported to any ocean location where there is a strong wind resource , says @entity27			2
an undersea cable transmits the energy produced on site back ashore			0
the costs for transporting electricity rise the further out to sea the structures are placed			0
" we feel the ideal distance is out of sight from land , typically 12 - 18 miles , " says @entity27			0
" this distance mitigates stakeholder visual concerns yet decreases the exposure to exorbitant transmission costs			0
" @entity27 highlights lower construction costs -- the @entity14 turbine cost â ‚ ¬ 20 million ( $ 24.9 million ) to build and install -- as a major advantage the technology has over existing offshore wind farms			1
see also : who 's funding @entity76 the fact that turbines and their platforms can be assembled on land ( unlike bottom - fixed devices which are assembled at sea on specialized vessels and cost as much as $ 250,000 a day to charter ) means " the cost and risk profile ... is significantly reduced , " she says			1
but while bullish about the technology 's potential , @entity27 admits there remains a way to go before floating turbines become profitable enterprises			2
the initial structure off the coast of @entity8 is merely a pilot installation to prove the device works and is viable , says @entity27			2
" at the moment we are making money but not enough to cover our costs , " she says			0
" there is no doubt in my mind however that this is going to be a profitable technology and profitable venture in the future			0

a floating wind turbine has been *inaugurated* off the coast of @entity7 , @entity18
the 54 - meter tall structure can produce enough energy to power 1,300 households
the consortium behind the turbine hope to install five more devices to create the world 's first ever floating wind farm
