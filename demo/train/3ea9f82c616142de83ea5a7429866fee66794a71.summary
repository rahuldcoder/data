-- who would n't be interested in a choose - your - own - adventure sex farce or " @entity5 : the @entity6 " ? those are just two of the performances on tap at fringe festivals this summer			1
such festivals have their roots in @entity13			1
upon its launch in 1947 , the @entity14 of performing arts was eclipsed by a more grassroots event			2
in makeshift venues around the city -- " round the fringe " of the official performing arts festival , one journalist put it -- artists began mounting small - scale , independent performances			1
the " fringe festival " concept was born			1
this freewheeling style of celebrating the arts is finally gaining a foothold in @entity31 : the @entity31 @entity32 lists 24 annual events in its directory ; of these , half are 5 years old or less			1
fringes are generally distinguished by short , unconventional performances , low - cost tickets and a large share of ticket sales returned to artists			1
many open their stages to amateurs as well as seasoned acts			0
" fringes are supposed to be risky , even for the organizers			1
otherwise , what 's the fun ? " asks @entity49 's @entity48			1
most festivals sell buttons or badges for a small fee that act as a festival pass ; individual shows are priced separately			1
here are nine @entity31 fringes you might dip into for your dose of culture this summer : @entity61 may 14 - 27 in @entity62 perhaps appropriately , given its @entity66 proximity , the country 's longest - running fringe also encompasses the largest kids ' fringe in the @entity31			1
it 's also notable for its international reputation for " innovative @entity73 content , " says festival producer @entity74			1
this year 's tag line is " over 100 @entity77 through @entity78			1
" among them , all chosen by lottery : a " choose - your - own - adventure sex farce , " a historical magic show and a play about a soul - searching @entity87			0
buttons are $ 9 ; show tickets are $ 3 - $ 11			0
@entity90 @entity91 june 24 - 29 in @entity92 , @entity93 since 2012 , tourists have had another reason to descend on @entity93 in summer			0
@entity92 's @entity96 includes 60 acts and more than 100 performances , held in a variety of bars and clubs as well as theaters			1
with staggered show times , patrons can be seen " running from one venue to another ... [ it 's ] a level of energy and excitement you do n't normally associate with theater , " says co-founder @entity112			1
acts are selected by lottery , with local artists heavily represented ; the tentative schedule ranges from puppet improv to " @entity118 " who hands out cheese samples			0
tickets are $ 10 , with discounts on multishow passes			0
@entity123 @entity124 june 12 - 29 in @entity125 taking a " free - for - all approach , " this @entity127 festival does not select artists , but instead facilitates cooperation between would - be performers and willing venues			1
with more than 800 performances and 17,000 seats , its menu is extensive ; this year 's includes a @entity137 - skewering play called " @entity138 " and a one - woman " comedy tell - a - thon / telethon " dedicated to " @entity141			1
" shows are held at small theaters , studios and cafes ; buttons are $ 5 and get you $ 1 off tickets , with other perks			0
performers and venues determine show length as well as ticket prices ( generally $ 10 - $ 15 ) ; many shows have pay - what - you - will performances			1
@entity158 @entity159 july 10 - 27 in @entity160 taking place within three downtown blocks in @entity160 , @entity159 is headquartered with offices and a pop - up " gypsy tent bar " near @entity166			0
this year , a series of inaugural site - specific works have been selected , such as @entity170 's " @entity169 , " a peddler 's cart @entity170 will use to distribute " advanced degrees " to passersby around town			2
buttons are $ 5 in advance , $ 7 during the festival ; show tickets $ 17			2
@entity180 @entity181 june 18 - 22 in @entity182 " @entity186 focused , " according to founder and executive director @entity188 , the @entity181 is concentrated into just a few clustered venues in an effort to bring the larger @entity182 community together			0
" we 're trying to build that critical mass , " @entity188 said			0
" we want people to come to the grounds and linger			0
" selection is determined through a mixture of first - come , first - served and lottery			0
this year 's offerings include a didgeridoo performance , an improvised biography by a comedy troupe and a burlesque show entitled " a @entity201			2
" badges are $ 5 ; tickets are $ 12 or less			0
@entity204 @entity205 july 31 - august 10 in @entity206 and @entity207 since its 1993 founding , this @entity209 festival has remained uncensored and uncurated			2
this year 's lineup includes a @entity213 dance show , a @entity215 adaptation and " @entity5 : the musical			2
" " it 's not uncommon to see groups of people ( often strangers ) huddled in a lobby or on the sidewalk exchanging reviews ... or trying to figure out what the must - see show of the festival is , " says executive director @entity217			1
tickets are $ 12 adults , $ 5 children ; adults also need a $ 4 button			0
@entity232 @entity233 june 5 - 8 in @entity234 this festival picks acts out of an honest - to - goodness hat			2

@entity255 @entity256 august 8 - 24 in @entity257 not surprisingly , the city that 's home to the @entity260 movement -- a reaction to large , commercial theater -- hosts the country 's biggest fringe			1
like @entity257 , this festival is busy , encompassing 1,200 performances ; it 's also high stakes , with commercial producers and casting agents scouting around ( festival alums include @entity271 and @entity272 )			1
entry is adjudicated , with about 20 % of applicant companies accepted to perform			0
established writers , directors and actors participate , but ticket prices are still low by @entity257 standards : $ 15 in advance , $ 18 at the door			0
shows cover everything from multimedia and mime to opera and ballet ; full schedule announced in july			0
@entity289 @entity290 july 31 - august 3 in @entity291 this @entity291 festival takes its name from its area of special emphasis : variety and circus arts			2
