@entity0 , @entity1 -- earthquake victims , writhing in pain and grasping at life , watched doctors and nurses walk away from a field hospital friday night after a @entity10 medical team evacuated the area , saying it was concerned about security			1
the decision left @entity2 chief medical correspondent @entity15 as the only doctor at the hospital to get the patients through the night			1
@entity2 initially reported , based on conversations with some of the doctors , that the @entity21 ordered the @entity10 first aid and @entity23 to evacuate			1
however , @entity10 chief coordinator @entity24 , a doctor who was at the hospital with 60 @entity10 medical personnel , said it was his decision to pull the team out for the night			1
@entity24 said he requested @entity21 security personnel to staff the hospital overnight , but was told that peacekeepers would only be able to evacuate the team			1
he said it was a " tough decision " but that he accepted the @entity21 offer to evacuate after a @entity35 medical team , also at the hospital with @entity35 security officers , left the site friday afternoon			1
the @entity10 team returned saturday morning			1
@entity24 said the @entity21 has agreed to provide security for saturday night			1
the team has requested the @entity10 government to send its own troops for the field hospital , which @entity24 expects to arrive late sunday			1
responding to the @entity2 report that @entity15 was the only doctor left at the @entity0 field hospital , @entity21 spokesman @entity44 said saturday that the world body 's mission in @entity1 did not order any medical team to leave			1
if the team left , it was at the request of their own organization , he said			2
@entity54 , the @entity21 assistant secretary general for peacekeeping operations , told reporters later that local security officers deemed the makeshift hospital unsafe			1
" it seems that we 've heard some reports in the international media that the @entity21 asked or forced some medical teams to not work any more in some clinic -- that is not true , that is completely untrue , " @entity54 said saturday			1
@entity2 video from the scene friday night shows the @entity10 team packing up its supplies and leaving with an escort of blue - helmeted @entity21 peacekeepers in marked trucks			1
view or add to @entity2 's database of missing persons in @entity1 @entity15 -- assisted by other @entity2 staffers , security personnel and at least one @entity1 nurse who refused to leave -- assessed the needs of the 25 patients , but there was little they could do without supplies			1
more people , some in critical condition , were trickling in late friday			0
" i 've never been in a situation like this			0
this is quite ridiculous , " @entity15 said			1
with a dearth of medical facilities in @entity1 's capital , ambulances had nowhere else to take patients , some of whom had suffered severe trauma -- amputations and head injuries -- under the rubble			2
others had suffered a great deal of blood loss , but there were no blood supplies left at the clinic			0
@entity15 feared that some would not survive the night			1
he and the others stayed with the injured all night , after the medical team had left and after the generators gave out and the tents turned pitch black			1
@entity15 monitored patients ' vital signs , administered painkillers and continued intravenous drips			2
he stabilized three new patients in critical condition			0
at 3:45 a.m. , he posted a message on @entity117 : " pulling all nighter at haiti field hosp			2
lots of work , but all patients stable			0
turned my crew into a crack med team tonight			2
" are you in @entity1 and safe ? share your photos he said the @entity10 doctors did not want to leave their patients behind but were ordered out by the @entity21 , which sent buses to transport them			1
" there is concern about riots not far from here -- and this is part of the problem , " @entity15 said			2
there have been scattered reports of violence throughout the capital			0
" what is striking to me as a physician is that patients who just had surgery , patients who are critically ill , are essentially being left here , nobody to care for them , " @entity15 said			2
@entity146 , a @entity1 who has been helping at the makeshift hospital , said the medical staff took most of the supplies with them			2
" all the doctors , all the nurses are gone , " she said			2
" they are expected to be back tomorrow			0
they had no plan on leaving tonight			0
it was an order that came suddenly			0
" she told @entity15 , " it 's just you			1
" a 7.0 magnitude earthquake flattened @entity1 's capital city tuesday afternoon , affecting as many as 3 million people as it fanned out across the island nation			2
tens of thousands of people are feared dead			0
@entity1 , the poorest nation in the @entity166 , lacked adequate medical resources even before the disaster and has been struggling this week to tend to huge numbers of injured			0
the clinic , set up under several tents , was a godsend to the few who were lucky to have been brought there			0
retired army lt. gen. @entity175 , who led relief efforts for @entity177 in 2005 , said the evacuation of the clinic 's medical staff was unforgivable			0
" @entity182 must trump security , " @entity181 said			0
" i 've never seen anything like this before in my life			0
they need to man up and get back in there			0
" @entity181 drew parallels between the tragedy in @entity191 , @entity192 , and in @entity0			0
but even in the chaos of @entity177 , he said , he had never seen medical staff walk away			0
" i find this astonishing these doctors left , " he said			0
" people are scared of the poor			0
" @entity2 's @entity199 , @entity200 and @entity201 contributed to this report .			1
