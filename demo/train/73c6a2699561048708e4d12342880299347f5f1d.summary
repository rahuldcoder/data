@entity0 -- the top @entity3 commander in @entity4 is expected to ask the @entity6 administration for additional troops and equipment , according to a senior @entity3 military official familiar with gen. @entity11 's thinking			1
gen. @entity11 's report on the war 's status will be delivered in august , the source says			1
the request will be for troops and equipment for conducting intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance , as well as more assets to deal with roadside bombs and explosives , said the official , who declined to be identified because @entity11 's request has not been formally transmitted to the @entity27			1
the request could be made in coming weeks after @entity11 completes a " troop - to - task review " to calculate whether there are enough @entity3 troops in @entity4 -- and the right mix of troops -- to carry out the military 's war plan at an acceptable level of risk , the official said			1
the review could also lead to a request for additional troops for either combat or training of @entity4 forces , but the official emphasized @entity11 has not made a decision on that			1
the military already has tasked an additional 4,000 troops to train @entity4 forces			2
the official said @entity11 is likely to submit his recommendations to defense secretary @entity52 as a series of options , with each option having a level of risk attached to it			1
" this will start the discussion " within the highest levels of the administration about whether to send a significant number of additional troops , the official said			2
@entity52 has signaled he would be open to sending more troops if it could be demonstrated they are needed			0
but he also has expressed caution that the @entity3 not send so many troops that it has too heavy a footprint in the country			0
the troop - to - task review will follow @entity11 's assessment of the war , due 60 days after he took command in mid-june			2
that report is expected to be sent to @entity52 and @entity78 's secretary general by august 14 , the official said			0
it will discuss a detailed strategy for success of the counterinsurgency mission , such as the need for @entity3 and @entity4 forces to conduct more integrated operations and the need to focus on population centers			0
it is also expected to call for an increase in the number of @entity4 security forces			0
" this will be a really frank and honest discussion of how things are , and what it takes to get the job done , " the official said .			0
