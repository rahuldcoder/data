@entity0 , @entity1 -- the dinner crowd trickles in slowly at first , some taking time to play a little pool in a recreation area , others just wait patiently in line , or find a spot to sit and strike up a conversation			1
on the street , @entity10 has a reputation for its pleasant and welcoming staff , and , as @entity14 puts it , a place to get a good " feed			1
" and of late , there are many new faces among the familiar			1
at a restaurant , that 's a sign of progress			1
at a support organization for the young homeless -- like @entity10 -- it is a troubling sign of the times			1
more troubling is to take an up - close look at @entity0 's streets and parks after @entity10 shuts down for the day , especially as temperatures drop and the combination of rain and gusty winds makes for bone - chilling conditions			1
" last year we had 2,057 young people , " said @entity34 , the executive director of @entity35 , the organization that oversees @entity10			1
" this year we are on target to serve over 3,300			2
so literally a 50 percent increase in the demand for services			1
" increased demand , but reduced resources -- a painful double whammy of a sour economy : 10.2 percent unemployment nationally , 9.3 percent in @entity48 's latest figures			1
" we 've had family foundations who have been supportive of us for 20 year saying we ca n't this year , " @entity34 said in discussion of how the bad economy hurts @entity35 's bottom line			2
" we 've lost a lot of corporate sponsors this year			2
" the result is an urgent need to do more with less			2
those coming for help range from 14 to 22			2
every now and then , someone younger wanders in with a group			2
" when the economy crashes , what we saw are the families that are barely hanging on , barely able to deal with the stress they were facing every day , people who were kind of on the lowest tiers of the economy -- their families fell apart , " @entity34 told us during an afternoon and evening visit to @entity10			1
" they collapse under the stress of financial woes , " she said			2
" @entity76 may be home too much , people may start drinking too much , and just the day to day stress of living with a young person or adolescent -- and all of a sudden , young people are on the street			1
we 've had people come in and say , ' i 'm here			1
i am 18 years old			2
my family ca n't afford me anymore			2
' " @entity14 considers herself an @entity10 success story			1
she left home because of " a little bit of family problems due to my youth and rebellion , and so i just wanted to experience life			2
you get hungry after a while , so you need to come somewhere to eat			1
" her first visits to @entity97 were just for " the feed , " but then , after living on the street " on and off for about two years , " @entity14 remembers : " i just kind of woke up one day and decided that i 'd had enough , like i was n't happy -- like i thought i was happy			2
" through @entity100 , she worked on her ged , and then joined one of the vocational training programs -- this one for baristas for local cafes and coffee shops			1
it is an 8 - week program , and @entity14 is now job - hunting while working on longer term goals			0
" i want to do social work , go to college for that , " she said			0
" and maybe go to college to get my own business and open my own café			0
" and , importantly , she is back living at home with her mother while looking for work and planning to get her own apartment			0
" i just felt at the time , i could do it by myself and i did n't need any help , " @entity14 told us			0
" but now i know i was naïve			0
" @entity34 measures @entity10 's success in different ways			1
one is by the numbers : " over 12,000 meals a year , 10,000 showers			0
and believe it or not 10,000 pairs of socks to keep those peoples ' feet warm			0
" another is by the improved esteem -- and job prospects -- of many of those who first entered the facility just to get a hot meal or a few hours shelter from the rain			0
@entity143 and @entity144 are from very different backgrounds , but became friends as classmates in an @entity10 technology class			1
@entity143 , now 21 , left home in @entity150 three years ago and came to @entity0 to be with a man he met over the @entity152			0
" i was just , you know , coming out as queer , and i wanted some time on my own to get things sorted out for myself , and work up the courage to actually tell them			0
" but the relationship did n't work out , and " i was hideously ill - prepared when my roommate decided to kick me out			0
and then i was homeless for about two months			1
" @entity144 is a @entity0 - area native who was reluctant to discuss his family circumstances , except to say he sometimes stayed at his grandmother 's but , " i 'm not supposed to be there			0
" he described himself as homeless and on the street " about a month or two , " but mostly bouncing around among friends			1
at @entity10 , both took a course in computer diagnostics			1
finding a job is difficult at the moment ; @entity144 is working as an intern at @entity97 , and @entity143 took a job at a local bowling alley			0
but both are optimistic they will be able to benefit from their new training once the economy recovers			1
" i came here kind of lost , " @entity144 said			0
" and i found myself , a whole lot more than i intended to here			0
" @entity143 said at job interviews , " i show up wearing a suit and tie just like everybody else and i basically just present myself as best i can and try to appear , for lack of a better word , normal			0
" asked if he considered himself something other than normal , @entity143 said his experience without a doubt gives him a different perspective			0
" i 've been cold , " he said			0
" i 've been hungry			0
i 've been soaked to the skin and tired and sick and injured			0
and you definitely learn quite a bit about yourself from that			0
