@entity0 -- scroll through @entity2 , and you 'll get a kick out the sheer variety of projects with tin cups in hand			0
a documentary about the @entity11 fantasy role - playing game , a zombie board game , even a sprouting pencil -- all are looking for handouts via the popular crowd - funded site			0
but one project in particular caught our attention in the @entity1 newsroom			0
called " float , " it gives @entity24 residents the tools to measure air quality for themselves with pollution - sensing kites			1
kites have been flown for recreation , sport and art. but for environmental monitoring ? it is the tethered aircraft that got the best of @entity35 , and it 's now tracking air quality that 's among the worst in the world			1
" there 's a long tradition of kite flying and kite making in @entity46 , " says @entity38 , a masters candidate at the @entity39 and one of the co-creators of @entity22			2
" there 's a large group of enthusiasts , and we really wanted to tap into this existing group of people excited about kites			0
" float raised over us $ 4,500 on @entity2 to hold workshops for @entity24 residents to learn how to build and fly pollution - sensing kites			1
among those taking part , 40 - to - 70 - year - old @entity46 workers and retirees who enjoy flying kites -- including a 72 - year - old kitemaster			1
blog : clearing the air in @entity46 the kites are equipped with small modules that detect carbon monoxide , volatile organic compounds ( @entity69 ) and particulate matter			1
air quality levels are displayed through led lights that change in color -- from hot pink ( which represents the worst air quality ) to green ( which signifies the best )			2
all data from the flight is stored on an sd card			0
@entity38 and her team have held two workshops and a group kite flight in the evening to create a sparkling web of glowing crafts			0
float is keen to highlight the visual and sensory experience of their project with @entity38 telling me , " from the ground looking up , it 's like a kite flash mob because the sky is full of all these kites			2
" but a constellation of pollution - sensors in the sky is more than public art or a reboot of a popular pastime			2
in @entity46 , it can be a political challenge			0
in june , a senior @entity46 official demanded that foreign embassies stop issuing air pollution readings			1
citing the @entity108 , deputy environment minister @entity107 said foreign embassy pollution readings were illegal			0
@entity111 readings challenge @entity46 's smog claims though @entity107 did not name any countries in particular , it was seen as throw - down directed at @entity111 's diplomatic missions which post hourly air quality readings via @entity118 for @entity24 , @entity119 and @entity120			1
the @entity111 readings , which frequently rate @entity24 's air as " unhealthy , " are widely viewed as reliable alternatives to @entity46 's own monitoring reports			1
@entity46 may say only it has the right to monitor its air pollution			2
but @entity22 has untethered @entity46 's official grip on air quality data with its high - flying sensors			1
on its @entity2 page , @entity22 acknowledges the politically sensitive nature of its project			0
the team writes : " urban air quality is a serious issue that affects rapidly industrializing cities globally , and within @entity24 as the capital of @entity46 , it is an issue kept quiet by the government under fear of criticism and protest from the public			1
" @entity38 insists their project is not seen as threatening , and looks forward to future workshops in @entity24 next summer			0
and with a smile , @entity38 tells me : " it 's hard to imagine the government getting upset with a group of retired guys who enjoy flying kites			0

air quality is politically - sensitive in @entity46 , with official readings not considered *accurate*
