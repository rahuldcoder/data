-- it 's always been a mystery to me why @entity5 lawmakers who denounce the evils of government choose to run for office			1
if your belief is that the private sector holds the answers to all that ails us , it seems like you would want to go out and prove the case			0
so the may 9 vote by the @entity18 @entity5 to eliminate the @entity19 , which collects statistics about the nation 's population , is confusing			1
doing away with the data collection would seem to commit two cardinal sins against the right 's ideology : make government less efficient and eliminate a critical tool for profit - driven business			1
you may not know the @entity19 as separate from the @entity32 census			1
while the census takes place once every 10 years , the @entity19 is an ongoing data collection survey administered by the @entity35 to provide more in - depth and current statistics about demographic patterns in @entity32			1
this information is crucial if you care about smart direction of the $ 400 billion in annual state and federal grants to schools , hospitals , infrastructure projects and other critical services			1
the data derived from the survey provides guidance about how to divvy up best those hard - earned taxpayer dollars so that they are spent with as much care and precision as possible			1
apparently , that dynamic is lost on @entity32 rep. @entity54 , a @entity5 who beat @entity55 to win @entity57 's 8th @entity56 in 2010			1
he introduced the amendment to repeal the survey as a way to make good on his campaign promise to " stop wasteful spending			0
" with the affirmative @entity18 vote , he hopes to save $ 2.5 billion over the next decade			2
here 's the rub though			0
if @entity54 gets his way , @entity32 will spend $ 4 trillion in that same time period with no data to guide the funds -- essentially shooting in the dark with a massive amount of money			0
that 's the antithesis of efficiency ; vastly more than $ 2.4 billion is likely to be wasted in the process			0
it seems that along with climate change and evolution , statistical science now appears to be viewed with suspicion by the tea party			1
i 've not heard an alternative : perhaps a dartboard with pictures of all the states on it ? the @entity5 claims the survey is intrusive			1
but i have to wonder if the vote to repeal the survey is just a step toward tea party @entity5 ' @entity90 of eliminating government spending entirely and with it , the $ 400 billion in annual disbursements			1
if that is the path forward , let 's look at where that road functionally leads us : without the @entity19 , we wo n't know where veterans are living , so we ca n't get them the financial assistance they 're owed for their service to our country			1
without the federal and state grants , we simply ca n't take care of them at all once they come home			0
without the survey , we ca n't know where there are pockets of uninsured people , so health care funds can be directed toward offsetting the costs of emergency room visits			2
without the state and federal grants , doctors will be forced either to let people suffer and die or raise costs on all their patients to make good on their @entity121 oath			0
without the survey , we wo n't know where @entity32 still lack flush toilets and therefore risk contaminating the groundwater we all drink			2
without the federal and state grants , we ca n't mitigate the impact of raw sewage on our water supply and prevent disease from spreading when our water gets tainted			0
@entity54 might say : " let the private sector take care of it			0
" on that point , we can agree : the private sector can and should play a larger role maintaining the health of our country			0
the flaw in that plan is that our business sector is very reliant on the @entity19 in making decisions about how best to serve their customers			2
that 's why trade groups , including the @entity32 @entity146 and the @entity147 have voiced their opposition to the @entity54 amendment			0
the data provided from the survey has informed everything from where to locate new stores to what kinds of products are popular with consumers			0
these trade groups are hardly a bastion for government expansionists , and their opposition to this bill reveals the critical wedge in the @entity5 coalition			1
the business - first wing of the party is all too happy to allow government to foot the bill -- in this case , for solid market research -- when it 's convenient for them			1
the small - government ideologues are more than happy to dismantle government piece by piece even when it harms business and creates bad spending strategies			2
when asked about the elimination of the survey , @entity179 economist @entity178 said , " if you 're opposed to the survey , you 're opposed to understanding what 's going on in @entity32			2
" for this reason , it will be an uphill climb to get the measure to pass the @entity189 and get signed by the president			0
still , the initiative and the vote are telling			0
if knowledge is power and ignorance is bliss , eliminating the @entity19 will only pay dividends for those who live in powerful bliss			2
the rest of us would have to suffer through the mess being made of the informed and democratic process			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			2

@entity206 : it 's odd @entity18 @entity5 voted to kill @entity35 's @entity19
she says survey makes government more efficient , is a critical tool for businesses
without it , she says , government will lack crucial information on where *citizens* are , their needs
@entity206 : if it 's a tea party - driven *yen* to cut waste , it will do the opposite by *misdirecting* funds
