-- in the aftermath of the 42 - year rule of @entity4 , the world is left wondering whether the bloodiest conflict in the popular unrest that has swept the @entity7 will signal the rise of democracy in @entity10 or a descent into chaos			1
a group of economists is proposing one solution to help a strong @entity10 emerge from the smoldering ruins of civil war : give all @entity10 direct annual payments from oil revenue			1
call it the ' @entity22 solution			0
' " in 1982 then - governor @entity26 of @entity22 said , ' look , there is no check or balance on our use ( of state oil revenue ) , " said @entity23 , a senior fellow at the @entity24 in @entity25			2
@entity26 started a program to give residents annual checks from the state 's petroleum fund			0
" that held @entity26 and all his successors into account			0
" @entity10 is a textbook example , @entity23 said , of what is known as the " resource curse " - countries whose economies depend on oil , gas or other natural resource exports			1
it 's sometimes known as " the paradox of plenty " - rather than create an economic boom , export cash from resource - rich nations often flows directly to corrupt leaders while most the population does n't share in the wealth			1
how to handle a sudden burst in commodity wealth is an issue that echoes around the globe , from the huge copper and coal mines plumbed in @entity66 , to the offshore gas fields in @entity68 and vast tracts of lithium deposits in the @entity71 of @entity72			1
" of course you have corruption , but i think the key thing about understanding how the resource curse works is it impedes economic and political development , " said @entity73 , a senior fellow at the @entity74 in @entity25			1
resource curse in the @entity7 research shows the more a nation 's economy is dependent on export of natural resources , the less that nation 's economy is likely to grow , says @entity88 , an economist at the @entity89			1
" but it 's a chicken and the egg question - is it natural resources that cause this low growth , or some bad economic and political conditions as a result of just specializing in natural resources ? " @entity88 said			1
the unrest in the @entity98 world demonstrates the resource curse at play			1
" why was the population ( of @entity10 ) not able to get rid of @entity4 by their own , as they did in @entity104 and @entity105 ? one likely part of the answer is that the oil revenues in @entity10 is much more important than in @entity105 and @entity104 , which gives the ruler a much wider menu of political choices to fight the democratic demands from the population , " @entity88 said			1
" and why was the response in @entity115 to hand out large sums of cash to the people ? presumably this was not because suddenly that they cared more about the people - the more likely answer is that this was a move to maintain political power and avoid demands for democracy , " @entity88 said			0
" so i think indeed the varieties of experience in the @entity128 in the last months have much to do with oil revenues			2
" major natural resources are n't necessarily a national curse			1
a recent survey of the 10 most livable cities by the @entity134 is dominated by cities in @entity136 and @entity138 - nations that both have booming commodities exports			2
while @entity143 countries like @entity144 and @entity145 have had moribund economic growth despite resource riches , diamond - rich @entity141 is the fastest growing economy in @entity149			1
" here in @entity151 we are one of the largest oil and gas exporters in the world ; i can observe that in @entity144 oil has been bad , but in @entity151 it is good , " @entity88 said			1
a key difference between nations that do well with natural resources and those that are " cursed " depends on the strength of government institutions before nations strike underground wealth , economists say			1
@entity141 is one of the few @entity143 nations with a parliamentary system of government			2
@entity151 had 200 years of democracy before its off - shore oil industry took off in the 1970s			1
instead of giving direct payments to citizens , @entity151 has plowed all its oil revenues into a public fund for use in education or other public works			1
" we use 4 % of the fund every year , the ambition is you do n't eat the principal but live off the interest , " @entity88 said			0
@entity66 grapples with ' curse ' on the steppes of @entity66 , the land of @entity187 has released a horde of coal and copper in recent years , causing an economic explosion in this landlocked nation in @entity194			2
but worries are rising with its national coffers , @entity66 prime minister @entity195 said			0
" we talk a lot these days , and especially the last couple years , about the resource curse , " @entity195 told @entity0			1
" we have seen the @entity151 experience of sharing the benefit with the people			1
we have seen the @entity206 stability fund , we have seen @entity136 and @entity22 model , " @entity195 said			0
" we should not reinvent the wheel , we should better learn and copy from good successes			0
" for example , @entity66 is using mining revenues to finance child cash benefits			0
each @entity66 citizen will receive 536 shares from the privatization of the @entity217 coal mine in southern @entity66			0
" hopefully , the people will appreciate that they are responsible for an investment in their own future and that they will learn how to treat those shares and use them for benefit for themselves and their children in the future , rather than just selling them , " said @entity218 , president of the @entity219			0
yet the challenges are stark for @entity66 , which has only has 20 years of democracy			0
the nation ranks 116th out of 187 nations in the 2010 @entity234 corruption perceptions			0
one - third of @entity66 's 2.8 million people live below the poverty line			0
corruption " is an enormous problem , but one of things we 're hoping to do with our partnership with the @entity242 is to make certain the listed companies have proper transparency and management , " said @entity218 of the @entity219			0
are taxes the solution ? giving direct payments to @entity10 , @entity73 and @entity23 argue , is a way for a new government in @entity252 to foster closer economic ties with its citizens - through taxes			1
taxes create an incentive for the government to make broad improvements across the economy to increase government revenues			0
and , as the @entity265 phenomenon in the @entity266 shows , taxes create a populace that is deeply interested in how government spends its cash			0
" they are going to watch the government like a hawk , " @entity23 said			0
" if one year people get a $ 500 check ( from oil revenues ) and the next year they get $ 400 , they 're going to wonder why			2
" " people think ( an oil find ) is @entity279 from heaven , so you do n't need to tax , " @entity73 says			2
" but that severs that two - way relationship between the governed and those who are governed			0
" two practical problems to giving away oil cash : convincing leaders it 's in their best interests , and the modalities of getting that cash to citizens			2
" the latter is actually the easiest ... there 's been a lot of advances in biometrics , such as iris scanning and fingerprinting , along with e-banking through cell phones , " @entity23 said			0
trying to talk leaders in resource - rich countries to give it away , however , is another matter			1
both @entity23 and @entity73 have approached leaders in @entity68 and @entity144 , respectively , to distribute it - both were rebuffed			2
still , a new government in @entity10 could have a unique " constitutional moment " to allow its oil profits to flow directly to the populace , @entity73 said			1
" @entity10 is a country that has had virtually no political development for nearly 50 years , " he said			2
adds @entity23 : " when you have a moment of transition , there 's a lot of uncertainty - that 's a moment you can lock into a certain kind of path you may not find for another generation			0
" @entity0 's @entity323 contributed to this report			0

' resource curse ' hits economies depend on oil , gas or other natural resource exports
' paradox of plenty ' can prop up weak or corrupt leaders at expense of economic growth
some economists believe countries like @entity10 could *reform* through sharing oil wealth
many countries , such as @entity141 and @entity151 , have avoided the ' resource curse '
