@entity0 -- president @entity2 signed the budget agreement covering federal spending for the remainder of the current fiscal year on friday , bringing an end to any remaining fears of a government shutdown			1
the bipartisan deal , which won approval thursday from both the @entity12 and @entity13 , cuts $ 38.5 billion in spending while funding the government through september 30			1
in a @entity12 statement , @entity2 expressed his objection to two sections of the agreement , which prohibit the use of funds to transfer @entity22 detainees into the @entity23 and to move detainees into the custody of foreign countries unless specific conditions are met			2
" despite my continued strong objection to these provisions , i have signed this act because of the importance of avoiding a lapse in appropriations for the federal government , including our military activities , for the remainder of fiscal year 2011 , " the president said			1
" nevertheless , my administration will work with the @entity40 to seek repeal of these restrictions , will seek to mitigate their effects , and will oppose any attempt to extend or expand them in the future			2
" the president also said his administration would interpret a section of the agreement so as not to strip him of the right to fund some senior @entity12 adviser positions			0
with its passage , @entity12 and congressional leaders now turn their attention to what are expected to be more rancorous battles over the budget for the next fiscal year and the upcoming need to raise the federal debt limit			1
the deal covering the current year was announced by key leaders shortly before midnight last friday , a mere hour before what would have been the start of a partial shutdown			1
spokesmen on both sides of the aisle portrayed it as a step toward controlling @entity23 's skyrocketing debt			0
the measure passed the @entity75 - controlled @entity12 on a 260 - 167 vote			2
the bill would not have passed , however , without support from members of both parties			0
fifty - nine members of the @entity75 majority opposed it , showing the challenge faced by @entity12 speaker @entity85 , @entity86 , in keeping his conservative @entity88 - infused caucus unified amid politically perilous tax and spending negotiations with the @entity91			0
the @entity12 vote also reflected growing liberal angst and anger over the impending spending reductions			2
only 81 @entity91 backed the measure ; @entity12 minority leader @entity97 , @entity98 , voted no. in the @entity91 - controlled @entity13 , the final vote was 81 - 19			0
@entity12 passes sweeping @entity75 budget cuts under the deal , $ 38.5 billion will be cut from the budget , including funding from a wide range of domestic programs and services such as high - speed rail , emergency first responders and the @entity109			1
as part of the agreement , @entity40 also voted thursday on measures to de-fund @entity113 and @entity2 's health care overhaul			1
as expected , both passed the @entity12 and were defeated in the @entity91 - controlled @entity13			0
one point of concern for conservatives was a report released wednesday by the nonpartisan @entity120 showing that of the $ 38.5 billion in savings , only $ 352 million will actually be realized this fiscal year			1
@entity85 insisted thursday that all of the cuts will take effect eventually , but conceded that the analysis caused a degree of " confusion " among @entity12 members			0
" i 'm disappointed , " said freshman rep. @entity129 , @entity130			0
" i just think we could have gotten more			0
