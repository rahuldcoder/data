-- it was , said @entity2 , the highest level of grand slam tennis he had ever been involved in , an unquestionable highlight of his career			1
no wonder after the @entity7 surpassed such luminaries as his head coach @entity10 on the all - time list of grand slam winners with a seventh career title after edging @entity14 for a second @entity16 crown			1
" it means a lot to me , " @entity2 -- the newly crowned @entity17 -- told @entity0 after his 6 - 7 6 - 4 7 - 6 5 - 7 6 - 4 victory			0

before , the highlight of my career was the 2011 win at @entity16 but this is even more special because of the fact i had lost five of the previous six grand slam finals			1
" i 've been through some tough moments privately and professionally			0
" in a pulsating final , neither player could be separated -- @entity2 seemingly in the ascendancy only to let slip a big advantage leading two sets to one and 5 - 2 , before @entity14 broke back to force a fifth			2
but as two of the defining forces of men 's tennis traded blows in a match complete with 143 winners , it was @entity2 who emerged triumphant , putting him on a par with @entity48 and @entity49 on the list of all - time grand slam winners			2
a year ago , @entity52 had blazed past @entity2 in three sets to win @entity16			2
the @entity7 's chance of redemption went awry in the final of the subsequent grand slam , the @entity58 , this time to @entity59 , who was again his vanquisher at last month 's @entity62 final			1

this was the first big win of his nascent relationship with @entity10 , a partnership that has raised a few eyebrows			0

" @entity2 's victory denied @entity14 an eighth @entity16 title and 18th career grand slam title , leaving the @entity93 without a grand glam win since 2012			1
but @entity2 had words of consolation for his opponent			0
" @entity14 proved why he is a 17 - time grand slam champion and why he has been so successful and dominant in this sport for so many years because he knows exactly what challenges he 's facing and what to play in important moments			1
" he did n't drop his level much in the whole match so he did n't give me too many points but i had to earn everything that i had today and that 's why i thought the level was tremendous and it makes the win even more special			0
