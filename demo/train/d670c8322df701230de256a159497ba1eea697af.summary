ever feel like no one really understands you ? well " @entity3 " could be about to change all that			1
that 's because @entity3 is actually a robot and touted as the world 's first with the ability to read emotions			1
the humanoid robot -- which looks slightly like a shrunken @entity10 -- was unveiled to curious onlookers in @entity13 stores on friday by @entity14 , a @entity16 telecom giant and @entity17 , a @entity19 robotics company			1
@entity3 does n't look much like its name			2
standing under four - feet tall with a tablet computer mounted to its chest , it has human - like hands and a mermaid - like lower torso â€” though its toddler - like voice seems incongruous with this state - of - the - art facade			0
despite the high - pitched voice , @entity3 is able to converse about everything from the weather , to more sophisticated topics like the latest fluctuations in the stock markets			2
yet the great differentiator is the fact @entity3 is fully interactive , making eye contact when meeting people			1
@entity3 is " the first robot to read human emotions , " said @entity14 's ceo @entity42 told reporters at a press conference in the @entity16 capital on thursday			1
" robots like @entity3 are adding a new dimension in our daily lives			2
they would change it with the same magnitude as the pc , @entity54 and mobile phones did			0
" how @entity3 reads your moods using its emotion recognition functions , @entity3 can react to people in its vicinity -- making jokes , dancing and even rapping ( in @entity16 ) , as it did in an onstage demonstration on thursday			1
@entity3 can analyze facial expressions , human voice tones and gestures , then react autonomously through algorithms , its creators say			2
" our vision is to create an affectionate robot that can understand people 's feelings			2
then autonomously , it will take action , " said @entity42			0
he envisions robots playing roles in education , healthcare and entertainment , but their primary goal is n't to work in the industry like existing robots			0
" @entity87 's is not aiming for productivity , but rather at the home or store , where we provide fun and entertainment , " son said			0
@entity3 is designed to be a family robot -- perhaps more like a sleeker version of @entity96 , the household robot on the cartoon " the @entity99			1
" " @entity3 is powered by love inside a family , " son said			0
" not only is he making jokes , making them laugh			0
the robot acts out at its own expense , in natural disaster , it can help them and also comfort those people who are sad or lonely , encourage them or make them laugh			2
" when @entity3 goes on sale @entity3 goes on sale in @entity16 for around us $ 2,000 in february 2015			1
for now , several @entity3 are at @entity14 stores in @entity13 for spectators to visit			1
the creators say before releasing @entity3 for sale , they want the robots to accumulate more knowledge , to evolve and get more sophisticated in its interactions with humans			1
" several thousand @entity3 are going to learn at the store , " son said			0
" everything they learned and gained , is going to be accumulated into the cloud - based service			0
so that can be accelerating the evolution of the collective wisdom			0
" @entity3 functions through cloud - based artificial intelligence			0
@entity14 and @entity17 envision the robot being sold overseas eventually			1
after all , @entity3 is quite the polyglot , speaking 17 languages .			0
