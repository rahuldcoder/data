@entity0 -- in the 2011 suspense movie " contagion , " @entity4 's globe - trotting character dies from a virus that stirred up our memories -- and fears -- of @entity10 , the respiratory epidemic from @entity12 that killed several hundred people around the world in 2003			1
@entity4 played @entity16 , a woman who travels through @entity0 -- where we were treated to scenes of @entity20 , by some accounts the densest concentration of human life on the planet -- from where she boards a plane and subsequently spreads the deadly virus around the world			1
while the movie was fiction , @entity10 was very real			1
it made us feel nervous , vulnerable and afraid			2
but it also made us learn			2
exactly one decade after @entity10 hit , is the travel world ready if a similar epidemic -- a @entity10 2.0 -- were to break out ? experts in the aviation , hotel and health industries agree we 're now much better prepared than before to deal with such a potential calamity			1
but some still prefer to avoid publicly addressing the issue			2
here are five of the most important lessons we 've learned about handling global epidemics , ten years on			1
@entity10 helped the world realize we needed a global plan " the most important change has been the adoption of the @entity54 in 2005 , " says dr. @entity46 , @entity47 for the @entity49 and @entity48 in @entity50 , @entity51			1
the @entity54 , as @entity46 describes , is basically one massive global plan that maps an emergency response effort if a health emergency -- such as @entity10 -- strikes			1
at present , 194 states and territories have signed the legally binding agreement			2
ten years ago , a plan like this simply did n't exist			1
" during @entity10 everything had to be invented , " says @entity46			1
" it was the first time we were dealing with such a disease , such an international threat			1
we had to mount new networks of clinicians and laboratories			2
" and there was no obligation to report anything quickly -- as the world learned from a secretive @entity12 in april 2003			1
on one saturday that month , health authorities in @entity76 claimed just 37 confirmed @entity10 cases existed in the capital			1
one day later , @entity76 revealed 346 confirmed cases with another 402 suspected			2
the international community condemned @entity12 for withholding vital information			2
ten years later , the @entity54 now gives the @entity47 " probing powers " into any signatory country to check in and make sure everything is okay			2
countries are legally bound to report all they know			2
@entity10 helped us be more alert with technology and training while @entity90 , @entity90 , tracks airspace over the @entity92 and @entity93 for potential threats , the @entity47 boasts its own global watch system for brewing health crises			1
like a global plan , the capability for high - tech tracking also did n't exist ten years ago			1
" we now have a system that is constantly screening the web 24/7 for information and rumors , " says the @entity47 's @entity100			0
" we analyze them -- and some turn out to be false			0
however , every single piece of information is touching our attention and bringing the information to a team of people			0
" while the @entity47 has an army of 8,000 health and safety officials , the @entity113 in @entity0 has an 800 - person trained team of employees that both welcome and watch hotel guests			0
" we always want to be alert , but we certainly do n't want to be alarming , " says @entity120 , resident manager at the @entity113			0
the 20 - year industry veteran , who moved from the @entity92 to @entity0 last year , has an old 2003 emergency sars manual sitting on her desk			1
that has evolved into a general emergency response manual that the @entity126 uses to train staff			1
employees are taught to sanitize public areas -- elevator buttons , escalator rails , door knobs and restroom doors -- every hour or based on foot traffic frequency			0
in guest rooms , housekeeping disinfects frequently touched items with special focus on remote controls , light switches and bathrooms			0
" if a guest is ill we may refer them to a nearby clinic and notify proper authorities of any heightened concern , " says @entity120			0
even before hotel guests check in , thermal imaging technology at major airports serves as an earlier field of defense against visitors arriving with a fever			1
the closer your image is to the red side of the visible light spectrum , the warmer you are			0
too warm and you get a visit to the quarantine room for questioning and a potential sick bed			0
@entity10 taught us to appreciate breathing in deeply you board your plane , amble down the aisle , spot your seat and then ... mentally cringe : your red - nosed neighbor for the next several hours is coughing and sneezing into already - moist tissues			1
if air purity is a factor in which airplane you fly , the @entity170 ( battery problems notwithstanding ) is best , according to @entity175 , the @entity176 - based chief correspondent for @entity177			1
the two - decade aviation expert says the @entity170 's technologically advanced systems mean its air is the best - filtered in the skies			1
another benefit of the @entity184 system is a difference in cabin pressure			0
while other airplanes are pressurized at about 8,000 feet in altitude , the new @entity187 are pressurized at 5,000 feet , " so it 's a much more pleasant atmosphere			0
" higher humidity levels also keep that dry cottonmouth feeling at bay			0
the newer @entity194 's and the latest versions of the @entity196 and @entity197 also have well filtered air , adds @entity175			2
" as newer models come out , their internal air purification systems are more advanced			1
" but the 747 - 400 sits on the opposite end of the clean air spectrum because it 's " a relatively elderly aircraft " that 's been in operation for nearly three decades , says @entity175			2
while @entity208 retired its last 747 passenger jet in april 2012 , @entity0 - based @entity207 still has 18 in its fleet , @entity206 operates 23 and @entity211 boasts to be " the world 's largest operator of the @entity215 " -- with 57 aircraft			2
@entity10 taught airlines to be financially more resilient between 2001 and 2005 , an average of more than one major @entity92 airline filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection each year : @entity223 ( 2001 ) , @entity221 ( 2002 ) , @entity220 ( 2002 ) , @entity221 again ( 2004 ) and both @entity222 ( 2005 ) and @entity224 ( 2005 ) on the same day in a coincidence in timing			1
but from 2006 onward , just one major @entity92 airline filed for bankruptcy protection -- @entity228 in 2011			0
the reason is that catastrophic events , such as 9/11 and @entity10 , taught airlines an important lesson			1
when people stopped flying , " airlines recognized the thing that gets them into real trouble is running out of cash , " says @entity238 , head of consultancy @entity239 at @entity0 - based @entity241			0
airlines learned to " make sure they have enough cash flow " to weather turbulent times			0
" over the last five years , we 've seen oil prices hit 150 bucks a barrel , swine flu and a volcanic ash cloud " that all impacted air passenger numbers , says @entity238			2
" the industry has had plenty of practice and ( now keeps ) more cash on hand			0
it 's a pretty wide range for liquidity , but perhaps it 's 10 percent of revenue , maybe a bit higher			0
" if it had n't been for 9/11 and @entity10 , " a lot of airlines would have been bankrupt now if you threw the same issues over the last five years at them			1
@entity10 -- and other big , bad diseases -- still scare us sometimes what we learn is n't through what is said , but through what is not			1
although @entity10 occurred a decade ago , an inordinate number of people and businesses declined comment for this article -- including all four international airports in the @entity10 hub cities of @entity0 , @entity76 , @entity277 and @entity278			1
" the responsible person has a very full schedule recently -- sorry , " texted @entity281 spokeswoman @entity279			0
" this is something that we 'd rather not revisit at this point in time , " e-mailed @entity284 , assistant vice president of corporate communications at @entity277 's @entity285			0
@entity291 authorities told @entity1 it would take " several days to look at an application " for an interview after having been closed the entire week prior for @entity294			0
@entity295 never replied to e-mailed interview requests			0
" i do n't know why ( they would not talk ) to tell you the truth , " said @entity297			0
" i could understand the trouble with @entity76 and bureaucracy , but i would have expected @entity277 and @entity0 to be willing to talk about it			0
you fly to @entity277 and you can still see the signs and huge thermal imaging cameras			0
i 'd be happy to say ' we 've got these things			0
' " in the hotel industry , similar caution appeared to exist			2
@entity0 's @entity315 ( formerly the @entity316 ) , the @entity0 hotel that had the first reported @entity10 case in the city , declined an interview request			1
" i 'm sorry we do not want to put out any comments on the @entity10 issue because we want to look forward , " said @entity318 , public relations manager at the @entity319 in @entity20			1
" i have spoken to the boss			0
" the @entity0 @entity324 , arguably the city 's top hotel , also declined to discuss any precautions and response procedures it had in place			2
" feburary is our peak season and we are too busy to arrange any interview at this moment , " said @entity330 , the @entity324 public relations manager			0
and international airlines including @entity208 , @entity207 and @entity335 all either stopped communicating , only released statements or declined interview requests through their public relations agency			0
the lessons learned 10 years later ? we have a global response plan and advanced technology for disease tracking			1
and we have better training for hygiene and healthier airline financial strategies			0
yet while we 're much better prepared , @entity10 still scares us ... sometimes into silence .			1

the world is better prepared for a similar *outbreak* than in 2003
airplane *manufacturers* are putting more *emphasis* on *inflight* air quality
global response plan and advanced technology for disease tracking
reality is @entity10 and similar viruses still scare
