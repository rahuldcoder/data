-- @entity1 uses the internet to connect @entity4 teens affected by @entity5 and poverty with volunteer mentors from around the world			1
@entity1 is the founder of @entity9 and spoke with @entity0 about the importance of her group 's efforts in @entity4 -- where nearly two million children have been orphaned by @entity5			1
below are excerpts from that interview			0
@entity0 : how does @entity5 affect a @entity4 child ? @entity17 : they will talk about being very happy as children and growing up with two parents until they were grade school level			1
and then they 'll lose one of their parents			0
they will move where they can be in a community that helps support them and then they 'll lose the other parent			0
then they 're moved into a home where it 's an auntie running the house -- and they 'll lose that aunt			0
and then they go to live with the gogo -- or a grandmother -- and before long , they 're living with 10 other children in the same 20 square foot space			1
that gogo is spending all of her time just trying to feed everybody , much less being able to help them prepare for their future			0
@entity0 : how widespread is the problem ? @entity1 : many of these communities have lost up to 40 percent of the young adults [ from @entity5 ]			1
so the children ... do n't learn the survival skills that they would have learned tagging along with an adult -- watching an adult as they work , or do grocery shopping , or cooking or any of the life skills that they need			2
these children are losing , not only love and nurturing , but ... the education of having a parent attend to them			2
@entity0 : what 's the biggest challenge these kids face ? @entity1 : they lack access to everything that would teach them what is needed to be successful			1
there 's no technology ; there are no computers			0
the kids walk into our computer labs having never touched a mouse or a keyboard before			2
however , they are the most hopeful children you will ever meet			2
they are resilient , resourceful ; they are joyful ; they are very ambitious			2
@entity0 : what change do you see in them as they interact with their mentors ? if you reach out to them they will grab that lifeline and work so hard to make your investment of time and talent worth your while			1
they know that they are in a situation they would like to change -- their lot in life , their future -- but they struggle very hard until someone helps show them the way			0
what @entity9 does is we expand their village to include the entire world			0
when they get connected with their mentors , the mentors make sure that no one is ever truly alone			1
want to get involved ? check out the @entity9 website at http://www.infinitefamily.org and see how to help .			0

@entity1 founded a *non-profit* to help children orphaned by @entity5
she says the kids are resilient but just lack the *equipment* they need to succeed
mentors from around the world make sure the kids are never truly alone
