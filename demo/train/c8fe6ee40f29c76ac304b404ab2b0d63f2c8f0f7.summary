fanned by scorching summer winds that feel like they 're directed from a giant hair dryer , firefighters variously describe the sound of an @entity6 bush fire as somewhere between a freight train and a jet engine just before take - off			1
add to the mix boiling apocalyptic smoke clouds , desperate homeowners caught between fleeing or fighting the fire and sheets of fan - blasted flame that carpet whole stretches of country road , and it is little wonder that residents and firefighters regard bush fires with something approaching awe of the supernatural			1
" if @entity36 had come up with it as a special effect , you would n't have believed it , " one resident of the south coast town of @entity30 told me in the wake of devastating @entity34 bushfires of 2001			0
" at first you could only see a bright orange glow through the thick , white smoke and then , suddenly , there were flames 100 feet high			0
" they arched right over the road and set the trees alight behind my house			0
they were burning like candles			0
" the flames , almost freakishly , left his home unscathed			0
unpredictable and capricious , bush fires are an erratic phenomenon -- houses burn but kitchen tables are left intact , garages burn to the ground leaving cars inside untouched			1
for @entity66 , however , head of the @entity64 at the @entity6 science unit @entity65 , the explanations for bush fire behavior are more the stuff of science than science fiction			1
" quite often what you get reported in the media are firefighters who are extremely stressed trying to put into words things they 've witnessed , and interpreted by journalists who are keen to elaborate on the ' magic ' of the situation , " @entity66 told @entity70			0
" the thing to understand about fires , particularly landscape fires such as bush fires , is that they do follow physical processes ... where a fire appears to burn some houses and not others , there is a reason for that and that was because there was less fuel or a disconnection in the fuel			1
" he said after the fact , ordinary explanations can often come to light			0
" while seeing one house standing in a row of burnt houses may look surprising , when the fire was actually burning you learn sometime later there was someone there to put the fire out , " @entity66 said			2
" there are some very pedestrian explanations for what could be construed as supernatural events			0
" he said what is unique to @entity6 bush fires -- as against wildfires in the @entity119 or forest fires in @entity121 -- was their ability to throw " spot fires : " that is , carry embers on the wind and start fresh fires at a massive distance from the fire front			1
" the longest distance that an @entity6 bushfire can ' spot ' is about 30 kilometers , " @entity66 explained , adding that it was one of the primary reasons that fighting fires in @entity6 is so difficult			2
" spot fires are the result of burning debris lofted in the convection column of a fire being transported up to a great height , falling out of the convection column and transported downwind			1
" there 's a great potential for them to start new fires -- it allows bush fires to overcome breaks in fuel and topography			1
spot fires can jump rivers or ridges -- the fire throws spots over the break , those spots coalesce and form a new fire and off it goes			2
" he said one of the phenomena that his unit was studying was the ability for fires to restart -- known as " escaped fires " -- in some cases days after firefighters believe they 've been extinguished			1
" to all intents and purposes it looks like the fire has gone out but when there 's a change of wind direction , there 's always residual heat in the char fuel , " he said			2
" one of the biggest issues firefighters face is major changes in wind direction			0
one of the biggest causes of bush fires in @entity6 are ' escaped ' fires			1
" he said the burnt fuel can sometimes retain heat for long periods -- even without oxygen -- and has many of the qualities of peat fires , which burn underground for months			0
" the ability to black out a fire edge takes an awful lot of effort and an awful lot of water because you 've got this charring process that can retain residual heat for a long time , and that charring process is anaerobic -- it does n't need oxygen			2
" while firebreaks -- meeting the fire with a countervailing controlled fire running in the opposite direction -- are one solution , @entity66 says old fashioned vigilance is the only solution to @entity6 's perennial bushfire seasons			1
" you need to keep an eye on an area that was previously thought to have been put out , " he said			0
with the pattern of bad fire weather recurring during the fire season , he said new fires are sparked by old fires with depressing regularity			2
" during this fire season it happens twice a week -- every thursday and sunday it just flares up again			0

unpredictable and capricious , @entity6 's bush fires are an erratic phenomenon
@entity6 's science unit @entity65 says bush fires are unique in their ability to throw ' spot fires '
spot fires can sometimes flare up as far as 30km away from the main fire front
escaped fires are fires that flare up again once the *original* blaze was thought to have been extinguished
