-- @entity2 president @entity1 and his @entity4 counterpart , @entity3 , held what each man described friday as a " constructive " talk about @entity8 , though there 's no indication it produced any breakthrough consensus			1
what began as small talk after @entity3 approached @entity1 led to the two pulling up chairs in the corner of the room and talking almost entirely about @entity8 for 20 to 30 minutes , as other leaders watched , a senior @entity1 administration official said			1
afterward , @entity1 described the exchange on the sidelines of the @entity22 in @entity4 as " candid " -- but acknowledged that @entity3 was unlikely to support his call for military action against @entity8			1
@entity3 gave reporters a similar account , adding , " he does n't agree with me , i do n't agree with him , but we listened to each other			1
" both leaders said they could work together to seek a political solution to the @entity8 crisis			1
the two men hold opposing views over whether military action should be taken against the @entity8 government over its alleged use of chemical weapons against its own people			2
@entity1 is seeking to rally domestic and international support for a military strike , while @entity3 -- an ally of @entity8 president @entity39 -- has challenged the assertion that regime forces were behind the alleged chemical weapons attacks			1
@entity3 repeated the @entity8 government 's accusation that " militants " used chemical weapons in a bid to get aid and support from " those countries who support them			1
" he told reporters that @entity53 will continue to provide @entity8 with arms and humanitarian aid			2
he and @entity1 also talked about ways to solve the @entity8 crisis peacefully , he said			1
a statement issued friday by a bare majority of the @entity60 -- 11 of its 20 members -- said that " the evidence clearly points to the @entity8 government being responsible for the attack , which is part of a pattern of chemical weapons use by the regime			1
" " those who perpetrated these crimes must be held accountable , " it said			0
@entity1 said he believed most of the leaders at the @entity60 meeting were " comfortable with ( the ) conclusion that the @entity39 government was responsible " for using chemical weapons in an attack last month on a @entity77 suburb			2
but he said divisions arose over whether military action against @entity8 must be authorized by the @entity80 , where @entity4 has blocked action			2
citing @entity80 " paralysis " on the issue , @entity1 said countries should be willing to act without the council 's authorization			2
@entity1 : ' @entity87 can not stand idly by ' " if we are serious about upholding a ban on chemical weapons use , then an international response is required , and that will not come through @entity80 action			2
" but he said he was encouraged by the discussions in @entity95			0
" there 's a growing recognition that the world can not stand idly by , " @entity1 said			2
the @entity2 president showed emotion as he talked of the gassing on august 21 of what his country estimates was more than 1,400 people in @entity8 , 400 of them children			1
" this is not something we fabricated , this is not something we are using as an excuse for military action			0
... i was elected to end wars , not start them , " he said			0
" but we have to make hard choices when we stand up for things we care about			0
" @entity3 said the leaders in @entity95 were split nearly " 50 - 50 " over whether to intervene militarily			2
he said that action against @entity8 without @entity80 approval would be illegal			2
@entity4 and @entity120 , which has also opposed military intervention in @entity8 , have veto power			2
but that need not rule out action , @entity124 spokeswoman @entity123 told reporters friday			1
" we can not allow @entity8 to act with impunity because one or two countries refuse to hold them accountable in the @entity80 , " she said			0
the @entity8 government has said that opposition fighters launched the attack on the outskirts of @entity77			1
the @entity135 has said more than 100,000 people -- including many civilians -- have been killed since a popular uprising spiraled into a civil war in 2011			0
that toll rose friday , with the opposition @entity141 reporting at least 64 people killed nationwide			1
tensions affect some @entity2 staff in @entity145 , @entity146 as tensions ratchet up over @entity8 , the @entity124 on friday ordered the withdrawal of nonessential personnel from the @entity149 in @entity150 , @entity145 , and authorized nonemergency staff to leave a consulate in @entity153 in southern @entity146			1
" given the current tensions in the region , as well as potential threats to @entity2 government facilities and personnel , we are taking these steps out of an abundance of caution to protect our employees and their families , and local employees and visitors to our facilities , " a statement said			1
many observers fear that the civil war in @entity8 , which has become increasingly sectarian in nature , could spill into neighboring countries			0
the @entity124 also issued revised travel warnings friday for @entity145 and @entity146 , both of which share a border with @entity8			1
it urges @entity2 citizens to " avoid all travel to @entity145 because of current safety and security concerns " and to be " alert to the potential for violence " if traveling to or living in @entity146			0
many in @entity145 worry that the involvement of the @entity185 militant group @entity184 in @entity8 's civil war could destabilize their own nation			1
@entity145 has been shaken by a series of deadly bombings in recent weeks , including a blast in a @entity184 stronghold in @entity150			0
@entity192 warned this week that a regional war could break out if @entity8 is attacked			0
" @entity197 is a powder keg , and the fire is approaching today , " he told @entity195 newspaper @entity194 in an interview monday			0
@entity1 pushes for congressional action @entity1 is seeking congressional approval for possible @entity2 military strikes against @entity8 , although no vote is expected until after lawmakers reconvene from recess on monday			1
the president said friday that he had expected skepticism from the public and from lawmakers			0
he knew it was going to be " a heavy lift " when he announced saturday that he was putting the proposal before @entity213 , he said , with some lawmakers foreseeing a " slippery slope " toward a prolonged @entity2 involvement in @entity8			1
" for the @entity2 people who have been through over a decade of war now , with enormous sacrifice of blood and treasure , any hints of further military entanglement in the @entity197 are going to be viewed with suspicion , " @entity1 said			1
" that suspicion will probably be even stronger in my party than in the @entity226			0
" the @entity8 parliament has urged the @entity2 @entity230 not to support the proposed @entity2 military action , the country 's state news agency , @entity227 , said friday			1
in a letter addressed to @entity2 house speaker @entity234 , his @entity8 counterpart , @entity236 , called upon the @entity230 to communicate through civilized dialogue , not blood and fire , the news agency said			1
he said @entity241 extremists have seized and possess chemical weapons , @entity227 reported			0
@entity234 and @entity230 majority leader @entity244 have both backed @entity1 , but @entity234 has said it is up to the @entity230 to get the 217 votes needed to secure his resolution there			0
according to @entity0 's count , 109 @entity230 members plan to vote " no , " while 23 -- including a number of high - profile @entity226 -- plan to back it			0
more than 280 representatives remain undecided			0
