need outside help to feed your family ? you 're in solid company			2
a new survey reveals that one in seven @entity5 -- more than 46 million people -- relies on charitable programs and services to get the nutrition they need to remain healthy			1
the quadrennial hunger in @entity5 report was funded by @entity11 on behalf of the nonprofit hunger assistance group @entity12 , and compiled from answers to confidential surveys filled out by over 60,000 individual recipients of food aid and 32,000 surveys completed by the group 's network agencies			1
the results paint a portrait of an @entity5 still struggling to meet its most basic needs in the wake of an economic downturn			1
the survey was conducted during a historically high demand for food assistance , with unemployment and poverty rates remaining high after 2008 's recession			1
while the number of households receiving nutrition assistance from the federal government 's @entity35 ( previously known as food stamps ) increased by approximately 50 % between 2009 and 2013 , the report found that this was matched by radically increased need for outside charitable resources			1
how to feed your family from a food bank so who is going hungry ? children , military families and the long - term unemployed -- and it 's taking a toll on the nation 's health			1
" the results from this historic study are truly alarming			0
many of the people we serve struggle not only to get enough to eat , but also to keep a roof over their heads , the lights on in their homes , and to cover their healthcare and medicine costs , " said @entity52 , ceo of @entity12 , in a statement			0
the federal government defines " food security " as all people in a household having enough food for a healthy lifestyle at all times			2
according to a 2012 @entity73 report , more than one in seven households reported not meeting that criteria at some point during that year			2
around 7 million of those included a family member who skipped meals or went hungry so that other members could have enough to eat			0
of the households included in the hunger in @entity5 survey , 66 % reported having to choose between paying for food and paying for medicine or medical care , 79 % of households purchased the cheapest food available , even if they knew it was n't the healthiest option			1
thirty - three percent of those households include a member with diabetes and 58 % include a member with high blood pressure -- both conditions are linked to poor nutrition			1
how do you stretch your food dollars ? while @entity35 provides some relief for the lowest - income families and vulnerable populations such as seniors , children and pregnant and post-partum women , the nation 's 7 % unemployment rate between late 2008 and late 2013 added significantly to the number of food insecure households			1
many families considered " working poor " received no federal assistance because a member 's employment , full - time or partial , nudged them over the maximum income allowed to qualify , even if others were unable to find employment			1
it falls to charitable organizations , such as @entity12 's network of 200 member food banks to make up the shortfall			1
the group assists more than 46 million people annually , including 12 million children and 7 million seniors			0
ten percent of its adult clients are students , and 20 % of the families served include an active duty or veteran member of the military			2
among all of @entity12 's clients , 43 % are white , 26 % are black , and 20 % are @entity135			2
while just over half ( 55 % ) receive some assistance from @entity35 , one in five survey participants indicated that they never applied for benefits because they assumed that they would not qualify			1
opinion : @entity35 is n't about a ' free lunch ' on the national level , @entity52 's group secures food from corporate manufacturers , retailers and suppliers , as well as government food supplies , and distributes them throughout its network , which encompasses all 50 states as well as @entity153 and @entity154			2
feeding @entity5 also provides its local networks with $ 30 million worth of grants annually , and assists with individual food banks ' efforts to secure donations from local businesses			1
nearly 2 million volunteers provide the muscle -- 8.4 million hours ' worth -- for the network 's outreach each month , serving 3 billion meals over the course of the year			0
still , hungry @entity5 are left with hard choices about how to keep their families healthy			2
a query of @entity171 readers in the wake of last november 's @entity35 cuts that left 47 million people with $ 36 a month less to spend on food revealed both innovation and sacrifice from both food bank volunteers and patrons alike			2
" soup is always good			0
you can make 10 servings of good hearty and filling soup for less than $ 10			0
buy day or two old bread for toast , bread pudding or a breakfast			0
many stores sell baked goods at a discount price once they are a day or two old			0
@entity192 packed meats on their expiration day			0
you can often save $ 3 - 5 on such a meat package , " wrote one respondent via @entity196			0
another emphasized the importance of advance planning , writing , " i 'm homeless and i am still able to buy food and sometimes even meat ! why , because because i think about what i can buy before i get to the store with the money that i have ! @entity208 , @entity209 and @entity210 are my usual choices			0
@entity212 , shop at the outside aisles because these are where the cheaper brands and clearance items usually are			0
i can forage for food better than most , so i leave the welfare for the welfare moms ! " in @entity52 's eyes , the struggle for healthy food is one that all @entity5 must first acknowledge , and then help shoulder			1
" @entity228 2014 findings demonstrate the urgent need for all of us to address hunger in our communities , " said @entity52			0
" this data provides a factual basis for decisions about how we as a nation approach hunger relief and protect our most vulnerable citizens			0

in the wake of 2008 's economic downturn , a survey shows @entity5 are still struggling
one in seven @entity5 relies on charitable donations to feed their families
two - thirds of households say they have had to choose between medical care and food
the " working poor " often earn *slightly* too much to qualify for federal food benefits
