-- new @entity3 season , same old story			1
@entity5 world champion @entity4 began his quest for a fourth consecutive drivers ' title by putting his @entity10 top of the timesheets in practice ahead of the season - opening @entity14 @entity13			1
the @entity16 's lap of one minute and 25.908 seconds edged out teammate @entity17 , who was second fastest			1
" overall it was a good day for us , " the 25 - year - old @entity4 told the sport 's official website			2
" after all the mileage of testing , it was fun to be out there -- this circuit does n't get easier , it 's a good challenge			0
" " today was a good day and the balance was good , but we need to be ready for what 's coming up			0
" the nearest challenger to the @entity10 drivers was @entity32 ' @entity31 , who continued to show the pace which saw him go faster than any other driver during preseason testing			1
for @entity31 's teammate , @entity36 , this weekend will be his first grand prix since ending a 15 - year association with @entity39			1
it was n't an ideal start to a new chapter in his career for the 2008 world champion , with @entity36 ending the day seventh fastest after sliding off the track during what looked to be a promising lap. " overall it was a good day , if perhaps not the smoothest , " reflected @entity36			1
" i 'm happy with where we are and to see @entity31 in third place on the timesheets shows that we 're pretty competitive			2
" that 's a reflection of a great job that everyone has done at the factory and here at the track			0
i 'm looking forward to the rest of the weekend			0
" friday 's practice at @entity63 took place in favorable conditions , although wet weather is predicted for qualifying on saturday			0
@entity68 's @entity67 , who was sixth fastest , expects conditions to change completely , while he also doubts the @entity70 team will be able to compete at the front of the grid in @entity73			2
" our efforts were helped by particularly favourable weather with sunshine and summery temperatures , " explained the double world champion			0
" however , the weather is expected to change completely from tomorrow , with wind , rain and a significant drop in temperature , which could influence sunday 's race			1
" i 'm not expecting any major surprises here , we already knew we were not the quickest and that was confirmed today			0
the car responds well , but we know there is still much to do if we want to fight with the very best			0
