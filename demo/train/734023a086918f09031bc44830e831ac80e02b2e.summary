-- the death of @entity2 represents more than the loss of a great writer			1
@entity2 was perhaps the first to give voice with elegance , a poetic prose , and startling insight to the other side of the world which most @entity12 readers encounter in @entity13			1
for the first time , through the success of @entity2 's best - known book , " @entity19 , " a world both distinctive and familiarly human as well as uniquely @entity16 won the hearts of an otherwise ignorant and insensitive and largely condescending reading public in @entity23 and @entity24 , regarding @entity16 history and culture			1
it is a pity that not more of @entity2 's prose is as well - known as " @entity19			1
" at the same time , @entity2 took his place in the pantheon of great writers with one acknowledged masterpiece , alongside @entity34 's " @entity33 " and @entity36 's " @entity35			1
" but @entity2 's contribution was not merely literary			1
unlike most writers , he displayed few traces of narcissism			2
he was committed to his people and his community			2
he did not shy away from political controversy , and he did so in a manner that was unforgettable			2
he was soft spoken , gracious to a fault , generous			2
his charisma was one that mixed authority with kindness			1
he seemed to possess no limits to patience			2
he made his interlocutors and students feel that they were as important as he was			0
unlike so many he did not internalize the brutalities and prejudices of oppressors only to visit the very same quality on others when the oppression vanished			1
perhaps this was a function of his personality and his natural nobility and pride in his heritage			0
but it was also a function of his @entity67 faith and his commitment to the vocation of teaching and writing			0
@entity2 came to @entity72 after suffering an accident that left him paralyzed from the waist down			1
by coming to the @entity75 he was able to secure the proper medical care , and at @entity72 he became a member of an academic community as teacher and colleague			0
he used his prestige and presence to ensure that @entity16 history and literature would take their proper place in the education of undergraduates			0
one of @entity2 's most fervent admirers has been @entity90 , who once described the sense of hope he derived from reading @entity2 in prison			1
what @entity90 saw in @entity95 was the characteristic that inhabits all great literature : details that seem very particular retain their uniqueness in the hands of a great writer			0
but through the poetry of the prose what seems utterly foreign and unfamiliar becomes recognizable and profoundly thought - provoking			0
time and place are transcended without the loss of authentic particularity			0
these qualities are what have made great writers great , whether they be @entity113 or @entity114			0
@entity2 , drawing from his heritage and traditions , used his talent and gift of imagination to generate a visual and moral landscape entirely unfamiliar to most readers			1
his achievement was both historic and personal			0
if there was one dimension of disappointment that one could detect in @entity2 , it was the fact that he was famous for one great book when in fact he had written a whole series of great books			1
he suffered the same frustration that is perhaps more common among composers who become associated with one piece to the exclusion of the rest of the music they have written			0
one hopes that @entity2 's death will spark a renewal of interest beyond " @entity19			1
" that novel will remain a staple of world literature			0
readers should be encouraged to look at the novels @entity2 wrote aftewards			2
the simplicity of his language , the disarming lyricism , and acuity of perception define his greatness			0
but in the end @entity2 was in the best sense a moralist			1
not a preacher , but a writer who drew his readers into contemplating the possibilities of how they might lead a better life with a greater commitment to justice , to civility , to respect , and to simple decency			0
the opinions expressed in this opinion piece are solely those of @entity169 .			2

unlike so many , @entity2 did not internalize the brutalities and prejudices of oppressors , writes @entity169
his charisma was one that mixed authority with kindness , he says
@entity169 : one hopes that @entity2 's death will spark a renewal of interest beyond " @entity19 . "
@entity2 was in the best sense a moralist , says @entity169
