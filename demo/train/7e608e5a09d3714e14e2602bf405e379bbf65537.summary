-- late in january , the book publisher @entity2 told @entity3 it wanted to raise the prices of its books sold through the online retailer			1
@entity3 made clear it wanted to continue to set prices for @entity2 's books , as it does for most books it sells			1
to make sure the publisher understood it was serious , @entity3 cut the links that enable people to buy @entity2 's books via @entity3 's web site			1
for more than a week , you could still see @entity2 books on @entity3 ; you just could n't order one			1
even though the two companies have since struck a truce , the showdown should deeply concern anyone who cares not merely about the health of this vital industry , but about concentration of political power in @entity26			2
what should concern us foremost is not that @entity3 's managers believe they -- rather than the people who write and edit our books -- have a right to set the price for books			1
it is that @entity3 's managers believe they have consolidated sufficient power -- the company sells as much as 80 percent of all ebooks , for instance -- to enforce their will by cutting off the public 's access to a publisher 's books			1
more disturbing yet , @entity3 is not alone in having captured such a position			1
another company that has captured a real say over the actions of our publishers is @entity51			0
and @entity51 is a goliath that has repeatedly used its dominant position to influence the content of products by refusing to sell certain books or music			0
indeed , such brute use of power is increasingly the norm across our economy			2
as anyone who has studied the business practices of @entity51 , @entity65 and @entity66 knows , rough treatment of the people who make what we buy is true in just about every industry			0
it was not always this way in @entity26			0
a generation ago every city boasted its own department stores , discount shops and independent bookstores			0
power was so widely distributed that few retailers enjoyed any real power over suppliers			1
the consolidation in retail since then is due largely to two revolutions in our anti-monopoly laws			0
the first was the @entity89 of 1975 , which gave retailers the power to price other companies ' products			1
@entity94 was the @entity97 administration 's reframing of our anti-monopoly laws in 1981 around the concept of " consumer welfare			0
" until then , the prime purpose of anti-monopoly laws was to protect citizens against concentration of political power			2
since then , officials have used our anti-monopoly laws instead to lower prices			1
to achieve this end , they often virtually promote concentration of power over entire market systems			2
as a result , it is now all but routine for big firms , in their efforts to grow bigger and increase profits , to dictate prices to suppliers who depend on them to get to their customers			1
such use of power can strip away or destroy much of the cash suppliers would have invested in new products or simply to maintain systems and skills			1
there is nothing new in this			0
a century ago @entity138 @entity137 spelled out the dangers in a case in which a retailer manipulated the price of a drug , " i can not believe , " he wrote , " that in the long run the public will profit by this court permitting knaves to cut reasonable prices for some ulterior purpose of their own , and thus to impair , if not to destroy , the production and sale of articles which it is assumed to be desirable that the public be able to get			2
" in the case of @entity3 , consolidation has often been presented as a consequence of new technologies			1
and it is not entirely clear how we can apply traditional anti-monopoly laws , many of which have geographic components , to online commerce			0
but any careful reading of history will carry us to analogous challenges in our past , like those posed by the early railways , and thereby to other potentially useful forms of anti-monopoly law such as common carriage rules			0
also , most of @entity3 's abuses would have been avoided if the people who make our products ( in this case books ) still enjoyed complete autonomy to set their own prices			1
so too @entity51 , especially during last fall 's book price war			0
yet the fundamental flaw lies not with the decisions made by managers of these companies			0
it lies with viewing our anti-monopoly laws as a tool to promote a flawed vision of efficiency rather than to protect our most vital liberties			0
defenders of concentration will continue to justify their use of power with claims they are serving the " consumer			2
" but we should be clear that fixation on lowering prices can result in truly dramatic costs			2
sometimes it is degradation of the quality and safety of the products delivered to the @entity26 " consumer			0
" sometimes it is the concentration of power over the people who produce our books and other vital products and over the @entity26 citizen			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity213 .			2

dispute over *e-book* prices between @entity3 , publisher a power play , says @entity213
@entity213 : government has stressed lower prices while allowing growth of powerful retailers
he says the cost of the policy has been domination of retailers over suppliers
