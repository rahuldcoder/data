-- an essential nutrient found in fish oil does not appear to slow the mental decline associated with alzheimer 's disease , according to a new study in the @entity6			1
the study is merely the latest to cast doubt on the mental benefits of the omega - 3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid ( @entity9 ) , which until recently was considered a promising way to minimize the risk and damage of dementia			0
( the other main ingredient found in fish oil , eicosapentaenoic acid , or @entity17 , is not believed to play a significant role in brain health			0
) @entity0 : fish oil does n't benefit new moms , babies @entity9 or fish - oil supplements are n't likely to cause any harm to @entity25 's patients , but they are n't likely to do any good either , says @entity26 , @entity27 , the director of the @entity28 at @entity29			1
fish oil " seems to be healthy in general , and maybe for other things it 's helpful , but it does n't benefit cognitive function in a person with @entity25 's , " says @entity26 , who was not involved in the study			1
research on @entity9 has been inconclusive and sometimes conflicting			0
several studies that followed large groups of people as they aged have suggested that a diet rich in fish is linked to a reduced risk of dementia and mental decline , but most randomized controlled trials comparing @entity9 supplements with placebo have found no benefit			1
@entity0 : 9 foods that may help save your memory " it 's not the first time something in large epidemiological datasets just did n't work out clinically , " @entity26 says , noting that statin medications , anti-inflammatory drugs , and estrogen therapy have all failed to live up to their initial promise in preventing or treating @entity25 's			2
" unfortunately , that seems to be the situation here			0
" the study was funded by the @entity63 and was led by dr. @entity64 , @entity65 , a neurologist at the @entity66 , in @entity67			0
@entity64 and his colleagues randomly assigned about 400 women and men in their mid- 70s with likely alzheimer 's disease -- the disease is very difficult to accurately diagnose -- to take 2 grams of @entity9 or placebo capsules per day			0
after 18 months , the average mental decline in the @entity9 and placebo groups was nearly identical , as measured on two separate tests and rating scales			1
despite the disappointing results , the study does n't entirely rule out the possibility that @entity9 may have some benefit if taken earlier in life			2
a growing body of research suggests that dementia begins decades before any noticeable symptoms surface , and it 's possible that @entity9 helps prevent or slow those harmful changes			2
@entity0 : 25 signs and symptoms of @entity25 's disease treatments such as @entity9 may be too little too late for people who are already showing signs of @entity25 's , according to dr. @entity95 , @entity65 , a professor of psychiatry at the @entity97 , @entity98			1
" effective treatment strategies to prevent progression of [ alzheimer 's disease ] will likely need to be initiated earlier , " @entity95 writes in an editorial accompanying the study			0

studies show that an essential nutrient in fish oil does not appear to slow mental decline
fish oil seems to be healthy in general , but does not benefit @entity25 's patients cognitively
treatments such as @entity9 could prevent or slow dementia if started earlier in life
