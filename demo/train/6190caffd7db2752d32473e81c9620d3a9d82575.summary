-- @entity1 admitted that this year could have been better for him at the grand slams			2
he won the @entity3 but lost two finals and had clay - court king @entity5 on the ropes at the @entity7			2
@entity1 , though , had reason to celebrate monday as he became just the ninth man to spend at least 100 weeks at no. 1 on the tennis tour			1
@entity1 achieved the top ranking in july 2011 , taking over from @entity5 , and has mostly held down the no. 1 position ever since			1
when he caught @entity5 two years ago , it marked the first time since 2004 that the @entity15 or @entity16 was n't at the summit			0
" i was taught to dream big and to dream to be no. 1 in the world , " @entity1 told the @entity19 website			1
" it takes years of hard work and dedication			0
" it is a long process to become a champion			0
@entity27 is a very specific and unique sport , where you take all the credit or all the blame			0
" @entity1 's major breakthrough came in 2011 , when he claimed three of the four majors and started the campaign with 41 consecutive victories			1
although he only landed one grand slam title in both 2012 and 2013 , @entity1 appeared in a 14th straight grand slam semifinal in @entity38 this month , moving him more than halfway past @entity16 's impressive record of 23			2
@entity5 , however , is almost certain to reclaim no. 1 this fall since he trails @entity1 by less than 300 points and has no points to defend until 2014			1
indeed if @entity5 reaches the final of next week 's @entity44 -- where @entity1 is the top seed -- he 's guaranteed to leapfrog the @entity46			1
" there are still a lot of tournaments to come , " said @entity1			0
" calculations are not on my mind right now			0
i am trying to feed on the confidence that i have			0
" @entity16 holds the men 's record for weeks at no. 1 at 302			1
@entity16 is scheduled to return to action at october 's @entity56 while the other member of the ' @entity58 , ' @entity59 , is set to miss the rest of 2013 with a back injury .			0
