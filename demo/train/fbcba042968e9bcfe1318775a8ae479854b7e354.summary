-- for decades , fans of @entity2 have paid tribute to the @entity5 writer by leaving kisses on his tomb at @entity9 's famed @entity8			1
but years of greasy lipstick smears have badly damaged the memorial , a stone angel designed by modernist sculptor @entity13			1
now the monument has been painstakingly cleaned and restored -- and surrounded by a glass barrier to protect it from the makeup - laden pecks of passers - by			1
the freshly renovated sculpture was unveiled -- on the 111th anniversary of @entity2 's death -- by his grandson , @entity23 , and @entity25 actor @entity24			1
@entity27 's arts and heritage minister , @entity28 , said the occasion was " an opportunity to celebrate anew the life and works of one of @entity27 's great modern writers , @entity2 , who gave generously of his genius to the entire world			1
" @entity2 , the dandyish author , poet and playwright , wrote " @entity41 " and " @entity42 , " in @entity39 in the 1880s and 1890s			1
he moved to @entity43 in 1897 , living there in self - imposed exile after serving a two - year hard labor prison sentence for gross indecency following a trial which scandalized @entity49 society			0
" his last few years were very sad , " said @entity50 , chairman of the @entity51			0
" but there is always the sense that he was able to rise above his misfortunes , to remain buoyant and happy			0
" his letters say a lot about his lack of money , but they are also very entertaining , full of amusing anecdotes and stories			0
they paint a picture of someone who was down , but certainly not out -- though of course he was ' out ' in the modern sense			0
" he died penniless in @entity9 on november 30 , 1900 , aged just 46 , and was given a ' sixth class ' burial outside the city			1
his remains were moved to @entity8 years later			2
@entity13 's sculpture for the site was unveiled in 1914 , and has long been a site of pilgrimage for @entity2 's fans			1
in the early 1960s , one visitor hacked off the angel 's genitals , and the grave has been plagued by graffiti for many years			2
the graffiti was cleaned off in the 1990s when the tomb was listed as a historic monument , but despite a sign asking visitors not to deface it , the ' tributes ' have continued , with ink giving way to lipstick			2
experts fear that if the tradition continues , the sculpture may be damaged beyond repair			0
" the grease base of the lipstick penetrates the stone and long after the coloring pigments have faded , a grease ' shadow ' is still visible , " @entity9 's @entity92 said in a statement			1
" the tomb is close to being irreparably damaged ; each cleaning has degraded some of the stone surface and rendered it more porous and has subsequently necessitated a more drastic cleaning			0
" @entity50 said he hoped those who made the pilgrimage to the cemetery in future would pay tribute to @entity2 in a less destructive manner			2
" it has reached the point of no return really , " he told @entity0			0
" there has been wanton vandalism , destruction			0
now the screen is up , hopefully people will go and look , and if they feel the need to do something , they will leave a note , or some flowers -- there 's no harm in that			0
