i have often thought of @entity2 officials as the proverbial " plate spinners " from the circus			1
those talented artists who balance spinning plates on sticks , ever increasing the number of sticks , rushing from one to the other , giving them a tug and pull to keep them moving , always aware that if they are too slow or too fast , one of the plates will crash to the ground			2
that is exactly what we have in @entity2 today			2
only the artists are @entity20 president @entity19 , @entity21 head @entity19 , @entity23 president @entity22 et al , while the plates are @entity26 , @entity28 banks , @entity30 deficits , eurobonds and @entity33 chancellor @entity32			1
two weeks ago it was the @entity28 banks which were wobbling -- but a quick tug and push worth â‚¬ 100 billion kept the plate moving			1
before that it was the @entity38 referendum on the fiscal compact ...			0
. then it was the @entity26 election ...			2
and the artists now have to stand ready to renegotiate the bailout terms to give @entity26 breathing room ( after giving a tug to the @entity32 plate to prevent her falling off in pique )			1
@entity33 : is it really the villain ? there are some plates that are always spinning : getting the fiscal compact ratified ; the size and strength of the eurozone firewall ; the ever present problem of countries in recession			0
these plates always need attention			0
but then they are often joined by more plates : the @entity38 referendum on the compact ; the @entity26 de facto election on the euro			2
and then there are the plates that suddenly and urgently require immediate attention to prevent a spill			0
@entity28 bond yields are giving great cause for concern			0
oh , and do n't forget @entity30 bond yields			0
and the @entity2 bailout fund needs some attention -- there -- and while you are over there put another plate on a stick , this time call it banking union and get that moving			1
family tragedy tells country 's story sometimes there are so many plates spinning it is difficult to see which one requires the most immediate attention			1
is it @entity28 's banks which have just been promised a huge wodge of cash ? or the @entity94 and @entity33 banks which will suffer losses if @entity28 banks fail ? perhaps it is the @entity33 government 's intransigence ? of course , what is really important is neither the number nor nature of the plates that are spinning , but rather the competence and ability of the plate spinner			1
when you watch at the circus , you are not watching the plates , but the artist who is rushing from one to the other -- wondering if they will make it in time to avert a crash			0
human cost of @entity26 crisis the artists are the @entity2 leaders , both at national and @entity118 level			2
how good are @entity119 , @entity2 council president , and his fellow spinners @entity22 , @entity19 and @entity19 at keeping things going -- along with help from @entity124 , at the @entity125 , and others ? the spinners have given us some heart stopping moments , such as when it looked like they would stare down @entity26 into leaving the euro , or in midnight summits when they seemed unlikely to reach a deal			1
but the sad fact is that while they are keeping the plates spinning , they are doing very little to actually safely remove any of the plates from the stick and bring the act to a close			1
rise and fall of euro @entity147 it seems there are more plates spinning , and the antics of the spinners becomes more frantic as they rush from one to the other , ever proclaiming that the act is coming to a close			1
unfortunately that is not the case			0
the plate spinning is likely to continue for some time to come			0
we all need to hope that this is one act that has the stamina and ability to get to the end .			0

@entity165 's @entity164 : i often think of @entity2 officials as the proverbial " plate spinners "
the plates are @entity26 , @entity28 banks , @entity30 deficits , eurobonds , and @entity32
some plates are always spinning , while others need sudden attention
but it is the *skill* of the artists that matter -- and they show no sign of bringing act to close
