-- who was the real @entity2 ? was he the man who suffered anxiety attacks , remembered slights for decades and put every ounce of existential angst into his comic strip , " peanuts " ? was he the grandfatherly cartoonist hailed as a towering figure in @entity13 popular culture , who revolutionized the comic strip and created not only a multimillion - dollar business , but a daily touchstone for fans worldwide ? or was he between the lines in " @entity9 " itself , in the melancholy of @entity22 , the exuberance of @entity24 , the intellectualism of @entity26 , the directness of @entity28 and the bafflement of @entity30 ? biographer @entity31 was intrigued by the seeming divide between the popular image of @entity2 -- one the cartoonist fostered in interviews and talk - show appearances -- and the depth of emotion manifested in the comic strip			1
" i thought there had to be more , " he says in a phone interview from his home in @entity42			0
" [ he said ] things about himself in a self - deprecating way , with such a sense of humor ... but behind so much of it was a real guy who had placed himself in the characters of ' @entity9			2
' there was a certain amount of biographical ore to be mined			0
" the result of @entity31 ' digging , " @entity56 " ( @entity57 ) , appears tuesday			1
the book has received mostly glowing reviews , though @entity2 's family -- who agreed to interviews and gave the biographer access to papers -- has been sharply critical of the book 's warts - and - all presentation			1
" the whole thing is completely wrong , " @entity2 's daughter , @entity67 , told @entity68			1
" i think [ @entity31 ] wanted to write a book a certain way , and so he used our family			2
" added @entity2 's son , @entity74 : " it 's preposterous			1
" @entity31 defends the final work			0
" this was the man i found , " he told @entity77			0
certainly , " @entity56 " has its share of surprises			1
@entity31 draws parallels between @entity2 's sometimes contentious first marriage and the relationship between @entity22 and @entity28 , as well as how romantic affairs and fantasies emerged in the strip			1
( @entity88 , the book 's text is interspersed with hundreds of " @entity9 " strips that function as a kind of @entity94 chorus			2
) he observes that a number of character names -- @entity97 , @entity26 , even @entity22 -- had real - life roots			1
and he goes into @entity2 's dark places , from his fear of travel to the death of his mother			1
@entity2 's personality was established early on			1
the @entity105 , @entity107 - born cartoonist , the son of a barber , was a neat , reserved , anxious " good boy " as a child			2
he drew constantly -- his first success was a sketch of his dog that was reprinted in " @entity115 " -- but remained lonely and standoffish through his adolescence , terrified of girls , his work dismissed by his high school yearbook in a long - remembered snub			1
as @entity31 observes , service in @entity122 hardened and matured the young artist , but @entity2 never lost his childhood attributes			1
his sense of loss was deepened by the death of his mother not long after he joined the @entity127			0
later , he underwent a painful midlife divorce			0
@entity2 once characterized " peanuts " -- @entity131 's fantasy life notwithstanding -- as a study in disappointment			1
" all the loves in the strip are unrequited ; all the baseball games are lost ; all the test scores are d - minuses ; the @entity139 never comes ; and the football is always pulled away , " he said			0
but if disappointment were all there was to " @entity9 , " the strip never would have had such success , says @entity31			0
" @entity22 has to carry @entity2 's spears , and the slings and arrows of the world , " he said			1
" but i think @entity2 found something in his own character early on , which was fortitude -- which was the single quality he gave to @entity22			1
... it 's his fortitude , his endurance , his willingness to do all this without self - pity that makes us love him and admire him			0
" " @entity9 " also changed comic strips as we know them , exploiting minimalist lines and existential depth in a way few strips had even attempted , much less in a day - to - day fashion , says " @entity164 " cartoonist @entity163			0
" he pretty much invented the modern comic strip , " he says			0
@entity163 compares @entity2 's impact to that of @entity168 in film : " before @entity168 , you had one style of film acting , and after , you had another			1
@entity2 did that in the comic strip			2
" ( @entity163 , who considers @entity2 a hero , now gets to work under his spiritual wing as a member of the board of the @entity179			2
) moreover , despite his aw - shucks manner , @entity2 was also a shrewd businessman			1
" @entity9 " spawned a hit musical ( " @entity182 " ) , at least one hit song ( the @entity184 's " @entity24 " ) , fronted for advertising campaigns , was featured in countless tv specials and generated an empire of commercial goods			0
when his work was threatened , @entity2 stood his ground			2
@entity191 was uncomfortable with the @entity193 verses and jazz music of " a @entity195 , " but it went on just as planned			0
@entity2 also maintained a keen sense of competition			2
though always eager to help young cartoonists , he also liked to show them not to underestimate the old man			0
" when i told him that i was in 2,000 papers , he said ' i 'll see you in the @entity203 , ' " " @entity206 " cartoonist @entity204 told the @entity205			0
" he was very competitive -- and he was right ! he was the only one of us in the @entity203 , and i 'll never get there			0
" " @entity9 " remained the heart of @entity2 's life literally right up until the end			2
the cartoonist died of cancer on february 12 , 2000 , the day before his final sunday strip ran			0
in the end , @entity2 's gift was to expand the world of the comic strip -- and , thereby , expand the world of his readers , @entity31 says			1
" he kept saying this : there was complexity in the world , " @entity31 says			0
" and people who knew him kept saying there was complexity in his personality			0
... the thing that ' @entity9 ' taught us is that contradiction and ambiguity is as much a part of life as sweetness and happiness -- and to see @entity2 as any one thing and not another is to deprive him of being the man and the genius he really was			1
