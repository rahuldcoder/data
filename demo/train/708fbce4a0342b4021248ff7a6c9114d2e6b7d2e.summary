it 's an enduring game show that engenders affection while challenging even the most erudite among us			2
what is " @entity4 ! " ? yes , for 50 years the famed answer - and - question show has maintained a steady popularity , through an 11 - year network run , a short - lived reboot and , finally , a syndicated version with @entity10 that debuted in 1984			1
it 's an unlikely success story			2
at the time " @entity4 ! " premiered on @entity12 on march 30 , 1964 -- " history " was the first category introduced on the game board -- trivia - style game shows had been off the air for half a decade , a victim of the quiz - show scandals			1
the first host , @entity20 , was an actor who 'd never done a quiz show in his life			1
@entity23 dominated daytime with a combination of soap operas and sitcom reruns			0
and yet the first " @entity4 ! " lasted more than 10 years			1
years later , when the syndicated show debuted in 1984 , it faced equally long odds			1
a second @entity20 version had failed			0
@entity10 was best known for hosting a string of ratings losers such as " @entity33 " and " @entity34			1
" moreover , the show was initially given absurd time slots and pulled from many stations			0
but here we are , 30 years later , and " jeopardy ! " is still one of the highest - rated syndicated programs , with runs such as @entity43 's recent winning streak keeping it in the news			1
( disclosure : i was a contestant in 1988 , though not nearly as successful as @entity43			0
) what 's the answer to its success ? " it 's still the best mental exercise on television , " says game - show authority @entity50 , a professor at @entity52 in @entity53			1
" it has one of the greatest play - along capacities			0
and if you 're sitting at home , and you 're good on respective categories , it gives you as a viewer the ability to sit there and say , ' you idiot ! ' when a contestant misses the question			0
" a model quiz show the best game shows , says @entity72 , are the simplest -- and the easiest to play along with at home			1
" @entity78 , " @entity12 's recent foray into a prime - time quiz , was a flop not least because nobody understood the rules			1
( we 'll leave the host out of it			0
) @entity83 , game shows expert for @entity85 , agrees			0
" i ca n't think of any other trivia - based show that has the same longevity , and i think it 's because of the lack of gimmicks , " she says			0
" you could have watched it 30 years ago , and you watch it today and you can jump right in			1
" " @entity4 ! " itself struggled in a late - ' 70s go - round because a couple of unnecessary wrinkles were added			1
that version was one of the rare missteps in the history of the program			0
more often , thanks to its quick pace and clever questions , " @entity4 ! " has been regarded as a model of the quiz - show format			1
only the old " @entity112 " is held in such high esteem among trivia players			0
certainly , the show has become part of the pop cultural fabric			1
the catchphrase " the answer is ... " comes from the game , as does @entity10 's sympathetic " sorry " ( best said with a @entity120 accent )			1
the " @entity4 ! " music is as well established for contemplation as " @entity124 " is for celebrations			2
sitcoms have parodied it , celebrities have appeared on it , and a supercomputer used it to establish its superiority over humans ( including 74 - game champion and celebrity puzzlemaster @entity131 )			0
it 's even been tangential to a least one movie star 's life			0
in 1968 , @entity136 -- @entity138 's father -- won more than $ 5,000 on the show			2
the money probably came in handy : @entity136 soon moved his family to @entity142 and later to @entity143			0
treating the game with respect @entity72 does n't think any show will ever match it			0
networks now want their game shows to run an hour , he says , but most play better at 30 minutes			0
also , the last trivia - question game show to have an impact was " @entity154 " more than a decade ago			2
even with its success in syndication , it 's still no " @entity4 ! " perhaps a more interesting question is who could succeed @entity10 , who 's now hosted for almost three times as long as @entity20 ( a man whose name has probably become a trivia question itself )			1
the venerable emcee is now 73 , and though " @entity4 ! " remains in the @entity166 among syndicated shows -- right behind longtime stablemate " @entity169 " -- its average viewer is 64 years old			1
a younger host might be able to pull younger viewers , who are increasingly distracted with other games -- on their cell phones			2
( in the @entity12 version 's heyday , " jeopardy ! " was a favorite of college students , who flocked to its noon et time slot			2
) @entity183 's @entity182 has been suggested ; so has the " today " show 's @entity184			0
both @entity72 and @entity83 are fond of @entity186 , a @entity120 like @entity10 , who 's hosted several game shows while also serving as an anchor for the @entity190 news station @entity189			2
whoever it is , says @entity72 , has big shoes to fill			0
@entity10 , he points out , does the subtle things very well : he not only asks the answers and questions , but he keeps the game moving , takes an interest in the contestants and shows a sly sense of humor			2
" it 's got to be somebody who the viewer feels like treats the game with respect , and is n't trying to make it something that it is n't , " he says			0
after 50 years , can anyone question that ?			1
