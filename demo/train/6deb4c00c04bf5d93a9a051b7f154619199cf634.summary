in the afterglow of @entity6 's smashing re-election win last november , a chorus of big - name @entity1 heralded the charismatic @entity8 governor as the party 's savior in 2016			1
not everyone was so enamored			0
just days after the election , @entity13 gov. @entity12 appeared on national television and poured cold water on @entity6 's impressive victory			1
" he was a successful governor in @entity8 , " @entity12 said on @entity19 's " @entity18			2
" " now does that transcend to the country ? we 'll see in later years and months to come			0
we 're all different states			0
is a conservative in @entity8 a conservative in the rest of the country ? " the comments made headlines , but were largely seen as just another predictable potshot fired off by one likely presidential contender jockeying for position with another			0
but @entity12 's curt dismissal belied a much deeper resentment toward @entity6 -- and thrust a long - simmering tension between two of the @entity1 's biggest personalities into public view			1
it is a rivalry that continues today and colors many of the political discussions inside the usually drama - free @entity42 , the powerful fundraising committee currently helmed by @entity6			2
even with the slow - burning controversies that have engulfed his governorship in @entity8 , @entity6 , a prolific fundraiser , maintains the support of his fellow governors , barring any further revelations that contradict his story about the @entity54 lane closures			2
but should @entity6 ever be forced to step aside , @entity12 -- along with his close ally , @entity56 gov. @entity55 -- represents another power base inside the governors association that could step into the leadership void			1
in perry - world , @entity6 is seen as pompous and disrespectful , both to his fellow governors and the sense of collegial decorum that has ruled the governors association for years			1
to @entity6 and his allies on the committee , @entity12 is regarded as unserious , past his prime and too conservative for the national stage			1
when @entity6 traveled to @entity69 and @entity70 on thursday for a series of closed - door meetings with leading governors association donors , @entity12 was hundreds of miles from the scene			1
the @entity76 , which has turned its full artillery on @entity6 in the wake of the bridge fiasco , highlighted @entity12 's absence as a sign of republicans fleeing a scandal - tarnished governor			1
' they just do n't like each other ' the truth is that @entity12 likely would have avoided @entity6 anyway , with or without the subpoena - flecked drama back in @entity90			1
" there are factions within the @entity42 , " said an adviser to one @entity42 governor			0
" @entity12 is kind of the leader of one , and @entity6 is the leader of the other			1
they just do n't like each other			0
" like most of the people interviewed for this story -- including aides to both @entity6 and @entity12 -- the adviser declined to talk on the record so as not to offend two of the most powerful governors in the country			1
@entity6 and his close - knit team control the purse strings of the governors association , a cash - flush campaign committee that will help fund the party 's slate of gubernatorial candidates in 2014			1
and despite the embarrassment of his failed @entity118 campaign , @entity12 is angling to run for president again and continues to be a gatekeeper to many @entity1 donors in @entity13 , a wealthy state that doubles as an atm for @entity42 politicians			1
supporters of the two men who volunteered to discuss their relationship openly were cautious with their words			0
" i think there are stylistic differences based on their upbringing and where they come from , " said @entity42 operative @entity128 , chairman of @entity12 's 2012 caucus campaign in @entity130			1
" there is a humility that comes from being from the @entity137			0
and there is a brashness that comes from being from the @entity140			0
and that may be very apparent between the two of them			0
" most accounts of their sour relationship begin in 2011 , during the bruising @entity42 presidential campaign , in which @entity6 endorsed @entity148 on his way to the @entity1 nomination			1
with backing from some of the @entity1 's biggest donors , @entity12 entered the race late that summer to much fanfare , rocketing to the top of national polls and providing @entity148 with his first serious primary opponent			1
@entity12 had resigned his post as chairman of the governors association , but was still counting on support from his fellow @entity42 governors			2
but one of them , @entity6 , was reluctant to give it			2
@entity6 not shy with his thoughts about @entity12 throughout the @entity1 primary battles , even before his endorsement of @entity148 , @entity6 was not shy with his thoughts about @entity12			1
in private sessions with donors , governors and assorted @entity42 power brokers , @entity6 asserted that @entity12 was far from qualified for the @entity118			1
" @entity6 was unequivocal in saying that the @entity174 he had gotten to know , while a nice guy , was not suited for the presidency , " said one @entity42 familiar with the conversations			2
" that was not kept a secret			0
he was pretty comfortable telling people that			0
major donors , other governors and the like			0
that quickly got back to @entity12			2
" @entity12 's team chafed at the way @entity6 handled his endorsement process , in which the @entity1 candidates were summoned to @entity189 , the @entity8 governor 's residence , to dine with @entity6 and his top aides in hopes of winning his support			1
one veteran of @entity12 's campaign described the ritual as " imperial			1
" @entity12 never made the trip			0
when @entity6 ultimately endorsed @entity148 just hours before a debate in @entity201 , no one bothered to give a simple courtesy call to @entity12 - world , the former campaign aide said			1
after his presidential race concluded , a chastened @entity12 returned to @entity205 and began dabbling in governors association business again			0
according to @entity6 sympathizers , he discovered that his once - rising star had been eclipsed by a younger set of governors , chief among them the ambitious @entity6			2
" @entity12 had gotten used to being everyone 's favorite governor , " said one @entity1 strategist who works with the committee			1
" everyone loved the guy and he could raise a lot of money			0
and he took it hard that it did n't translate to presidential support			0
when he came back on the @entity42 scene , he showed up , and guess who everybody 's favorite governor was ? @entity6			2
a new guy with a lot of swagger and fundraising ability			0
and he was from @entity8			0
" " you can only have so many sheriffs in one town , " the strategist added			2
beyond the obvious political tensions -- both are headstrong politicians with room - filling personalities and @entity118 ambitions in 2016 -- people close to both governors point to a complicated cultural gulf between the two men when asked about their fraught relationship			0
@entity12 not naturally drawn to @entity6 @entity12 , the socially conservative son of north @entity13 ranchers who wears his evangelical faith on his sleeve , is n't naturally drawn to @entity6 , a lawyer raised in the shadow of @entity249 who wants @entity1 to move beyond the conservative orthodoxies that have damaged the party 's brand with swing voters			1
@entity6 is friendlier to the bumper crop of @entity42 governors who were elected in 2010 , in particular @entity258 's @entity257 and @entity260 's @entity259			2
@entity12 , who became governor nearly a decade before @entity6 , is notoriously close with @entity55 , the current vice-chairman of the governors association who is thought to have his own presidential aspirations			1
" those two are like brothers , " said the adviser to a @entity42 governor			0
" they 're always doing stuff together			0
" in summer 2012 , even before that november 's presidential election , @entity6 began jockeying with @entity55 to take over the chairmanship of the governors association in 2014 , a prime election year post that would give one of them a coveted launchpad for a potential @entity118 bid			1
@entity12 actively worked to support @entity55			0
but after an unusually furious bout of behind - the - scenes campaigning , @entity6 won the prized post , thanks largely to his star power on the fundraising circuit			2
@entity55 agreed to serve as governors association chairman in 2013			0
but the @entity287 rift was exposed again last november when @entity6 , the soon - to - be - anointed governors association chairman , moved to install @entity290 gov. @entity289 on the governors association 's executive committee			1
word of @entity6 's maneuvering frustrated @entity55 , the outgoing chairman , who had wanted to give the open spot to @entity12 , in part because of the @entity13 's fundraising prowess			1
" @entity12 got wind of this , got pissed , and started calling all these governors , " said one @entity42 consultant who witnessed the intense executive committee campaign that soon followed			0
another operative familiar with the incident said : " why keep a governor who has been the most prolific fundraiser in the history of the governors association and from a huge donor state off the executive committee ? it was strictly a power play by @entity6			0
" as @entity12 supporters tell it , @entity12 outworked @entity6 on the phones and whipped up enough support among his fellow governors to force @entity6 into a compromise : the governors association agreed to add a slot on the executive committee so that both @entity12 and @entity289 could serve			2
christie allies have a different take : the governor simply agreed to give both @entity12 and @entity289 executive committee posts to avoid an unnecessary flame war inside the organization			0
" the whole executive committee thing was very overblown , " said a governors association source when asked about the conflict			0
" once @entity6 figured out @entity12 wanted to be on board , he allowed him to be on board			2
and all the governors were happy with it			0
" as for the greater friction between @entity6 and @entity12 , the governors association source acknowledged some ill will but said the two @entity1 have an amicable relationship			1
" there may be some hangover from @entity6 endorsing @entity148 , but @entity6 respects @entity12 and his work as governor , and was happy to recommend him to join the executive committee , " the source said .			2

@entity12 's dismissal of @entity6 's big win in november belies a deep resentment
in perry - world , @entity6 is seen as pompous and disrespectful
to @entity6 , @entity12 is unserious , past his prime and too conservative for the national stage
" you can only have so many sheriffs in one town , " one @entity1 strategist said
