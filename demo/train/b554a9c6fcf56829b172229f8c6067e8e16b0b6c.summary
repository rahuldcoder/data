-- when black people protest against police violence in @entity4 , @entity5 , they 're thought of as a " mob			1
" but when white people got up in arms at the @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 , a few weeks ago -- for apparently no reason whatsoever -- they were merely accused of " disruptive behavior			1
" the two situations -- protests in @entity4 and drunken violence in @entity10 -- are not equivalent			1
however , it 's revealing how the two groups are perceived differently by society and and the media			2
how is it that the bad behavior of some black people is used to condemn an entire community , while the bad behavior of some white kids is excused and explained away ? maybe this is why residents of @entity4 protested in the first place			1
a grand jury will decide any day now whether to indict a police officer , @entity31 , who shot @entity32 , an unarmed black teenager , this past august			2
in anticipation of possible violence , @entity5 gov. @entity33 has preemptively declared a state of emergency			2
it will last for 30 days unless @entity33 extends it			2
@entity33 is taking the precaution in light of the mass protests this summer over how the investigation into the shooting was being handled			0
the protests were largely peaceful , but there were some looters and other troublemakers			0
the police were widely criticized for their over-the - top militaristic response , including riot cops in tanks with automatic rifles pointed at the protesters			1
complete coverage : @entity4 shooting and protests police aggression made the protests worse			1
@entity60 's @entity59 , who was on the scene , tweeted , " this has been the consistent pattern			0
unilateral police escalation prompts minor response from more volatile elements , justifying crackdown			0
" still , most protesters maintain an iron - clad commitment to nonviolence , which the @entity71 noted in a detailed report			1
yet , many on social media and some in the mainstream media continue to use the isolated actions of a small number of bad protesters to smear the entire community			1
the smears often carry a subtle , racially tinted message			0
" @entity82 in @entity4 , @entity5 " read a headline on the conservative @entity85 website , adding " is this @entity86 ? " " @entity87 , @entity88 , " read a headline on the conservative website @entity91			1
" we know now that thugs are thugs , " conservative radio host @entity92 offered on @entity93			0
now , let 's turn to white protesters : in mid-october , during the annual @entity9 in the small @entity99 town of @entity10 , @entity11 , some white college kids apparently had too much to drink and turned violent			1
they were hurling broken glass and rocks at police ( as well as , apparently , pumpkins )			0
at least a dozen people were arrested and 30 injured , with 20 taken to area hospitals			1
the troublemakers seemed to revel in the chaos and damage they caused , with one telling a local newspaper , " it 's just like a rush			0
you 're revolting from the cops			0
it 's a blast to do things that you 're not supposed to do			0
" " it demeans @entity4 and @entity118 to compare them to @entity9 , " professor @entity116 of @entity117 told @entity0			1
which is true -- and makes the contrast between how society perceives black and white behavior all the more striking			1
the protesters in @entity4 were airing legitimate grievances through mostly peaceful means and yet were denigrated , while the rioters in @entity10 were merely part of a party that " spun out of control " -- never mind that those in @entity10 were reportedly drunk and dangerous and disproportionately violent			1
the discrepancy is so jarring that none other than @entity135 , the notoriously lock - jawed right wing website , while managing to contort the incident to bash the supposedly liberal media , agreed , " critics of the media do have a valid point			0
there probably are a lot of reasons for the difference in coverage , racial bias among them			0
" just days after the @entity9 , riots erupted in the largely white town of @entity149 , @entity150			2
why ? because @entity152 's team beat @entity153 at football			0
the rioters " lit fires , pushed over street lights and threw rocks , beer bottles and other items at police , " reported the local news			0
police and fire vehicles were damaged			0
were the riot police , the @entity167 , or a state of emergency declared ? no. the city is just considering a law to ban upholstered furniture from outdoor areas , since the " tradition " of setting fire to couches apparently fueled the protests			0
could you imagine a news story about a black community with a " tradition " of burning couches ? the media would be pointing out how they 're " destroying their own community " and the right would make assertions about black people not deserving public assistance			2
earlier this year , students at the @entity191 rioted after their team lost the hockey championship			2
in 2013 , @entity195 students rioted after their team won the @entity196			2
the same year football fans at the @entity198 in @entity199 rioted even before the game started			2
and in 2011 , after the @entity202 won the national basketball championship , students rioted in the streets			2
these occurred in places with mostly white people			1
in these instance there were injuries , property damage and arrests			0
why are n't we talking about the epidemic of sports - induced violence among white people ? why are n't we calling on state and federal agencies to crack down on their clearly destructive lifestyles ? we do n't yet know what the grand jury in @entity4 will decide and how the community will respond			1
but residents want a public trial with transparency and accountability			0
if the grand jury decides not to indict officer @entity31 , protests can be expected			0
when that happens , let 's think about the real pain that residents of @entity4 feel			1
and if there 's any violence from a few angry demonstrators , let 's keep things in perspective considering the marauding bands of rowdy white football fans and rioting pumpkin kids .			1

@entity242 : some @entity4 protesters were compared to the " mob "
@entity242 : yet , when white people rioted , they were merely accused of " disruptive behavior "
she asks why are we so hard on @entity4 protesters but not rioting pumpkin kids ?
