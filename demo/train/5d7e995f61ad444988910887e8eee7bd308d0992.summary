-- what would truly delight the geek in your life ? it 's nearly impossible to know if you do n't share his or her peculiar tastes			1
it 's not good enough just to get them a @entity10 or copy of " @entity12			0
" ( you know they could solve a @entity10 by the time they were 7 , and they already own the complete collection of @entity18 in hardback			0
) show them you care by learning about the things they like and demonstrating that knowledge with your gift choice			0
start by determining what the geek in your life is obsessed with			0
geeks are passionate about niche interests , and a little digging on your part is sure to result in a wide - eyed , bouncy , emphatic " thank you ! " when it 's time to open presents			1
once you have a good idea , look to niche , online shopping destinations such as @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45			2
" we sell what we think is cool , " @entity46 of @entity40 said			0
" everyone here , all the product buyers , we 're all geeks			2
so we have a pretty good handle on what we think would work			0
" @entity46 said that sci - fi and fantasy - related merchandise always sells well for @entity40 , including anything having to do with franchises such as " @entity58 , " " @entity59 , " " @entity61 " and " @entity60			1
" you can also find plenty of geeky merchandise on broader sites such as @entity66 or @entity67			2
too late for shipping ? head for a comic book store , where you can generally find figurines , collectable action figures and specialized merchandise as well as comic books , graphic novels , dvds and manga			1
to find the comic book store nearest you , go to @entity81			1
or check out a hobby shop , which may have a room dedicated to games			2
also go to gaming stores or bookstores			0
bookstores such as @entity88 or @entity89 have gaming books , comics and manga as well			0
geek merchandise can be confusing for a gift - giver who does n't know what " @entity97 " is			1
( it 's a popular @entity99 franchise about a group of teenagers who pilot robot - like vehicles in an apocalyptic war against " angels			2
" ) that 's why @entity0 's @entity109 ! team collaborated with experts to compile a list of gift suggestions for the geeks in your life			2
but geeks are not one - size - fits - all , and our gift suggestions might not be right for your situation			1
if you ca n't find the specific thing the geek in your life likes , ask for help in a bookstore or comic shop			1
there 's usually one go - to geek on staff who can assist , pointing out suitable gifts within the genre			2
for example , if the comic book geek in your life has a good relationship with the local comic shop purveyor , they might have an established wish list of comic books from certain authors or artists			1
fans of some sci - fi or fantasy television shows may also be part of the comic book fan culture , since many shows , such as " @entity148 , " " @entity147 , " " @entity149 " and " @entity150 , " continue and develop story lines in comic book format			1
volumes collecting six - issue ( or more ) storylines are a growing phenomenon in the comic book world , so these would certainly be a big hit with the comic book geek in your life			1
" @entity161 " geeks crave stories and characters that are different from @entity165 comic books and animation , said @entity167 , editor - in - chief of @entity168 , a blog about @entity99 toys , collectibles and fan culture			1
" from @entity99 's obsession with over-the - top romance to the emphasis on always " doing your best " and working hard , there 's something about [ @entity99 entertainment ] that really makes you feel good , " @entity173 said			2
that 's why these geeks turn to manga , a @entity99 take on the comic book format , and anime , animated series and movies often based on the story lines in manga			1
titans in anime include filmmakers @entity193 , often called the " @entity195 of @entity99 , " and @entity196 , who created the groundbreaking 1988 film " @entity198			0
" while " @entity59 " and " @entity58 " have long defined what a passionate , sci - fi geek is all about , other established franchises such as " @entity61 " and " @entity200 " and newer shows such as " @entity202 " also have large , passionate fan bases			1
it 's critical to establish which character , space ship or story line the sci - fi geek is interested in			1
if your geek likes " @entity58 , " do n't assume that anything " @entity58 " - related will do			1
keep in mind there may be several iterations of the sci - fi franchise			0
@entity58 and startrek.com include information about their different incarnations			1
the mainstreaming of some fantasy franchises certainly makes shopping for a fantasy geek easy , since merchandise is widely available			0
you 'd have to be pretty out of touch not to be aware of characters and plot from " @entity229 " or " @entity230 , " given the popularity of the books and movies in the past decade			0
" we love to love the good guys and love to hate the bad guys			0
with the added factor of magic and / or futuristic technology thrown in , anything is possible , " said @entity237 , a senior staffer of @entity238 , a @entity18 fan site			0
see @entity238 's @entity18 gift guide gamer geeks may prefer retro selections like the @entity247 and @entity248 games from arcades			0
others could be into first - person shooter games or strategy games			0
gamers are n't limited to computer or console games -- tabletop games such as @entity257 capitalize on imagination and a role - playing penchant			1
most gamers like to stay on the cutting edge of titles and tech. so if a game came out in november , it is likely they already have it			0
but downloadable content -- content that adds to games after they are released -- and add - ons that make game - play faster will be appreciated gifts			2
of course , gift cards for game shops and outlets are the easiest way to please a gamer because they can choose exactly what they want			0
just do n't be alarmed when you hear , " thanks for ' @entity284 2010 , ' @entity285 ! " shopping for an astronomy geek can be tough			0
they 're not a one - star - fits - all kind of crowd , explained @entity291 , office manager for @entity292 's online @entity45			1
there are star geeks who like memorizing constellations and myths , @entity292 lovers who obsess over space travel and physics geeks who love stargazing and mapping			2
before you pick a gift , make sure you know which kind of space geek you 're dealing with			0
piece of advice : space geeks are not necessarily " @entity59 " or " @entity58 " geeks			1
if you assume they are , be prepared -- your space geek will be quick to point out the differences between the reality that interests them and science fiction			2
