-- in 1977 , my friend @entity1 and i went for dinner at a little @entity5 restaurant called @entity6			1
she had the lemon chicken , i had the shrimp har kow , and we each had an egg roll because in 1977 you could eat sugar and fat and deep - fried everything without its signifying that the apocalypse is at hand			1
our waiter placed the entrées in front of us and ceremoniously lifted the shiny silver domes			1
@entity1 's chicken was crunchy on the outside , moist on the inside , lemony all over , and i knew in an instant that i 'd made a hideous error in judgment -- i should 've gone with the chicken			2
i tell you this story to illustrate my willingness to admit when i 've made a mistake			2
in fact , i 've rarely ordered a breakfast , lunch , or dinner i did n't regret ; at this very moment , i 'm wishing i had an iced tea instead of a @entity39			1
but aside from the food thing and one very adorable guy in the early ' 80s who was all you 'd want in a man except for the fact that he was also looking for all you 'd want in a man , i am never , ever wrong			2
now , i 'm not saying i always take my own advice or trust my own instincts			1
i 'm merely suggesting that the world would be a much better place if everyone else were to do exactly what i tell them to do			2
but c'mon , admit it , you 've had the very same thought kicking around for years			2
still , i 'm the one with the column -- so now without further ado ... everything i know about the world and how you ( yes , you ! ) should live your life : 1			2
if you ca n't get a babysitter , for the love of @entity68 , stay home ! i do n't want to be sitting next to little @entity70 and @entity71 as they fight over a @entity73 at the midnight screening of @entity75			1
you wanted kids , so suck it up , walk it off , subscribe to @entity79			2
if your outgoing phone message is longer than , let 's say , the @entity84 segment of the @entity85 , it 's time to rerecord			2
calling to let your friend know you 're running late does not excuse your constantly running late			1
i 'd like to say a few words to every crabby traveler who responds with disgust whenever a baby cries on an airplane			2
perhaps you do n't know how babies work , but there 's been a study , and it turns out that giving a 4 - month - old the stink eye does n't actually accomplish anything			1
either have a little compassion or a little @entity100			2
here 's something for any gentleman who may be reading this : if you look good in a @entity104 , you will look even better in virtually any other kind of swimsuit			1
i came of age with the @entity110 hearings playing on the tiny tv in our avocado green kitchen			0
but every four years , i wrestle my apathy into submission , read up on the issues , and cast my ballot			0
i do n't care who you vote for ( that 's not really true -- i think you should be penciling in my name ) , but you 've got ta get in the game			1
any man who begins a conversation with , " i do n't want to hurt your feelings ... " is about to hurt your feelings			1
it 's the kind of phrase that 's never followed by , " ... but i just do n't think you 're eating enough			1
please have more lasagna while i get you a brownie			0
" other opening gambits that pretty much scream duck - and - cover include : " do n't take this the wrong way ... , " " you can feel free to say no ... , " and the always popular " look ... " 9			1
the problems of @entity140 and @entity141 should not be competing for the headline space in our brains			0
we have to be smarter than that , and if we 're not , we have to pretend that we are			1
get so excellent at something ( long division , friendship , @entity150 , removing cranberry juice stains , decoupage -- it does n't matter what ) that your genius will be impossible to ignore and your legendary expertise at removing cranberry juice stains while dividing six - digit numbers by 37 will either bring you glory beyond your wildest dreams or , at the very least , help you feel vaguely competent as you make your way through the world			1
allow me to demystify the entire real estate market for you : @entity164 means ridiculously small			0
@entity165 means a total wreck and ridiculously small			0
spacious , airy , luxurious , and grand all mean ridiculously small			0
i like a plastic bag and a bottle of water as much as the next self - involved me monkey , but it takes 430,000 gallons of oil to manufacture 100 million grocery bags , and if i were capable of doing even the most basic arithmetic , i 'd say -- well , who are we kidding ? i 'm not capable of doing even the most basic arithmetic -- just know that we 're in great danger of making @entity179 really , really mad			1
it 's time to stop prettifying the ugly stuff			0
spousal abuse means wife beating			0
global warming means the @entity186 is toast			0
and here 's a bit of trivia for you : the @entity194 administration did not coin the phrase enhanced interrogation			0
nor did it come from @entity197 on " 24			0
" nope , it was the @entity199 that originated that little bon mot back in 1937			0
to quote @entity201 , " @entity202 , widdoe wabbit			0
" take a chance , wear your heart on your sleeve , ask the most attractive man in the room to dance , say what you want , demand what you 're entitled to			1
there 's a pretty decent chance that you wo n't get it , but who will you be if you never even try ? note : only attempt the dance invitation if there 's actual music playing			1
sometimes i worry that we 've all become workaholics -- because getting through life can be really hard work			0
but ( with apologies to the fine people who pay my salary every week here at the fabulous @entity229 ) we need to log off , go home , and remember what it is to have dinner , conversation , and sex ... not necessarily in that order			0
