@entity0 -- @entity2 -- or " the demolition man " -- is how @entity5 's incoming prime minister has come to be known , thanks in part to his pugnacious approach to politics			1
@entity11 's nickname hardly bodes well for drumming up support in one of the most fractious governing systems on the planet , one which has speared all but one of its governments since @entity21 then again , the 39 - year - old 's backers say this football - fan mayor of @entity25 is precisely the breath of fresh air needed in @entity29 's stuffy halls of power			1
neither an mp nor an elected premier , @entity11 has managed to wrest control of the party 's leadership by promising to smash the gridlocked reform process and shift its axis to the center			1
how he thinks he will manage to garner more support than career politicians , like his predecessor @entity41 , is as yet unclear			0
what 's more : @entity11 had initially vowed only to seek the top job through the ballot box and not a leadership contest , meaning some are skeptical about what he stands for			2
'' what @entity11 's done is gutsy , '' says @entity49 of the @entity50 in @entity29			2
'' but he is not going to have the public 's support ; he does n't have the votes from the electoral poll			0
so this is going to be a difficulty			0
instead @entity49 says @entity5 is hoping that by virtue of his youth and dynamism @entity11 will have the energy '' to do something very quickly			1
" something , being the optimal word			0
@entity5 has been crying out for a plausible , long - term economic agenda for years , leaving the country wholly unprepared for the economic slump of recent years			1
often described as his country 's answer to @entity68 , @entity11 is good at talking the big picture , which is probably just as well because @entity5 's problems are n't small			1
first there 's a two trillion - euro debt pile to shrink , record unemployment , crippling and antiquated labor laws not to mention stifling business and payroll taxes			1
still , top of the list for @entity11 , will be moves to create the kind of political stability where such measures can actually take hold			0
this means ploughing on with plans to reform the parliamentary system in a move which is likely to cost the country its upper house -- or senate -- in its current form			2
however , @entity11 may be on a collision course with @entity93 after suggesting the @entity94 give his nation some leeway to breach its 3 % limit on the budget deficit in order to support a recent return to growth			2
@entity102 of @entity0 - based think tank @entity103 says @entity11 will have to prove himself on the international stage			2
'' he is relatively little known compared to his two predecessors , '' says @entity102			0
'' so he will have to act quickly			0
'' yet if anything , @entity11 is a long distance player			1
a marathon runner and keen sportsman , @entity11 already has an eye on the distant horizon -- saying he wishes to see this term through until the next election in 2018			2
addressing reporters after being asked to form a government by @entity5 's president -- as protocol dictates -- @entity11 said it would likely take a few days to get his key people in place			1
'' but i assure you , '' he said , '' i will give this commitment all the energy i have			0
'' commitment is something this former boy scout is known for and at less than half of the age of @entity130 , @entity11 certainly has energy			0
but he 'll need more than stamina to succeed			0
above all , he must find support			0
read more : is @entity11 ready to be @entity5 's @entity135 ? watch more : the future of @entity139 's economy			1

@entity11 is incoming pm of @entity5 , a country with a fractious governing system
it 's not clear how the 39 - year - old will garner more support than his predecessors
the country has problems *including* its two trillion euro debt pile and high unemployment
but @entity11 has shown he is a long - distance player -- and has youth and stamina on his side
