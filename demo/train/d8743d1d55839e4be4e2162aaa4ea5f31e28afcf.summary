-- i come from @entity2			1
i have lived my entire life under military occupation , and i have no memory of a time without struggle			1
i have seen my neighbors beaten , blindfolded , and kidnapped			1
i have seen children snatched from their mothers in the dead of night			1
i have seen my brother shot and friend murdered			2
i ca n't tell you how this holy land felt before the armored jeeps ' rumble			2
i ca n't trace a path from here -- from where the @entity19 surrounds me -- to the sea			2
but for as long as i can remember , i could not forget			2
forget the checkpoints , the harassment , the detentions			2
forget that i am not free			2
like all prisoners , my memories are what sustain me			2
but what i need now are new memories			2
that 's why i started filming			1
i wanted to make memories of my son , @entity32			1
i wanted to capture his smile , to chronicle his life in close - up			1
i wanted to crop out the occupation , the violence , the hopelessness			1
maybe you , too , have captured your loved ones ' firsts : the first words , the first steps , the first glimpse of that way he angles his head and grins			2
@entity55 's gentle voice is in so many scenes of our son 's early life			1
but as i continued filming , @entity32 taught me that there are other sounds more urgent in his world			1

" his first steps were in the shadow of groaning bulldozers and screeching cranes			2
not the kind children play with			2
the kind that build the colonies that are stealing our land			2
our land is @entity81 -- " a little village on a hillside			1
" that 's how the @entity85 described it a century ago , when we had already been there for many more			1
we are fewer than two thousand people , and we tend the land			0
we have no factories or office towers			0
there are no commuter trains or carpool lanes			0
for centuries , our walk to work has led through biblical fields of olive trees			0

they are -- we hear -- @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106			0
some say there are 50,000 or more			0
they use our precious water to wash their cars and fill their swimming pools			0
they seem to thirst for pavement , cold steel , and concrete			0
and when they were n't satisfied with what they had already stolen , they came looking for more			0
they came looking in @entity81			0
that 's when our families stood up and said , " no. " we did so peacefully , but persistently , through nonviolent protest against the @entity19 cutting through our land			1
throughout , our only power was our conviction			0
and that conviction drew others -- @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106			0
one of them is my friend @entity131 , who helped me make a film			0
five cameras and as many years later , i invited the world to see scenes from my son 's first years - because the story of @entity32 's early life is also the story of @entity81 's resistance			1
the world calls it a documentary			1
i call it our story , a @entity99 story			0
in it , a farmer becomes a filmmaker , and a village stands taller than a @entity19			1
soon , this @entity99 story will contend for an award			0
it is a very big award , and many people will be watching			0
if it wins , what would i say ? how does a @entity99 , from a little village on a hillside , address the world ? i close my eyes and imagine the scene			1
there are a billion people , but i see just one			0
it is you , @entity32			0
you are a man , perhaps my age now , looking back at the 35 years that brought you there			1
what will you see ? what will your world look like ? and if you had a camera , too , what memories would you make ? as the world listens , @entity32 , i want to say to you : i am from @entity2			0
i have lived my whole life under military occupation , and i have no memory of a time without struggle			1
but you , son , you will know better times			1
someday , you will make new , happy memories			0
and that will be the true award			0
