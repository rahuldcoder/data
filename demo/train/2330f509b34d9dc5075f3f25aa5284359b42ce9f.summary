" " as members of the @entity18 , we must be wise before we use the credibility and respect of the ' @entity21 ' to extend legitimacy to a radicalized organization , " @entity10 said , warning lawmakers not " to endorse a group that has been subverted in the name of liberal progressive politics and the destruction of traditional @entity29 family values			1
