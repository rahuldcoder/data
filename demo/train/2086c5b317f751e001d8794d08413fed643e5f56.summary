-- my family moved to @entity3 in the late eighties when i was only three years old			1
like many @entity6 expats who grew up in @entity3 , i was fairly insulated from local politics			1
none of my friends or their parents talked politics , and most @entity6 expatriates like myself lived in safe , walled compounds , segregated and separate from @entity3 's villages			1
read more : @entity3 enacts stiff laws against ' terrorism ' before opposition protests even during the 1990s intifada in @entity3 , i do not remember witnessing much trouble			2
i heard the odd skirmish , and the occasional siren , but as a child you tend to think that the police are the good guys and anyone giving them trouble are " the bad guys			0
" sometimes people would discuss " trouble in the villages , " but other than that , my ignorance of the situation was the result of youthful indifference cultivated by an informal apartheid			0
fast forward to 2013 , and my youthful ignorance serves as a useful metaphor for the alarming extent of apparent @entity6 indifference to the ongoing political crisis in @entity3			1
@entity42 : @entity3 will pay heavy price for crackdown despite a lack of media coverage , state sponsored repression has been going on for the past two years			1
skirmishes in villages between groups of youths and the riot police occur almost daily , and while the former burn tires and throw @entity57 cocktails , the latter fumigate the villages with tear gas , a tactic so virulent that one @entity61 accused the @entity3 authorities of " weaponizing toxic chemical agents			2
" the skirmishes in the villages are symptomatic of over two years of repression by the @entity3 authorities			1
peaceful demands for political reform put forward by thousands of @entity3 in early 2011 have been ignored , and legitimate attempts to protest have been brutally repressed			1
renewed calls for demonstrations on august 14 have prompted the government to initiate a fresh swathe of repressive measures			0
@entity3 's opposition-less parliament recently passed reactionary laws banning peaceful gatherings in @entity3 's capital city and checkpoints , roadblocks and barbed wire fences have been erected around villages to stop people getting to protests			2
keen to censor any criticism , the @entity3 authorities have also arrested a number of activists and journalists , while some foreign observers have been denied entry			2
a lawyer representing a citizen journalist was even arrested for tweeting about the fact his client was tortured by police -- as if the message was not clear enough			0
the prime minister declared that @entity3 would " burn to a cinder all those who seek to tamper with its security and stability , " it is unlikely that these " @entity105 " protests will amount to anything , especially as the @entity3 authorities have spent the past two years breaking the back of the opposition movement			1
in 2011 , thousands were arrested , tens killed , and dozens tortured			0
doctors who bore witness to the gross excesses of the security forces were tortured and imprisoned on spurious charges			0
leaders of several political societies were arrested , tortured , and put in jail , where they still remain			0
thousands were fired from their jobs for participating in legal strikes			0
the state media spewed out sectarian hatred , and @entity127 and secular support for the populist movement was tempered by government propaganda that claimed , despite there being no evidence , that the pro-democracy movement was an @entity134 - backed attempt to install a @entity136 theocratic state			1
the government also demolished a number of @entity136 religious structures in order to anger @entity136 protesters and encourage them to become violent , and thus lessen moderate support for the movement			2
in an attempt to reduce popular sympathy for the pro-democracy movement , the government portrayed the movement as xenophobic and intolerant by exaggerating protesters ' attacks on expats			1
a government spokesman implied that 12 expats had been killed by protesters in 2011			0
in actual fact , two expats were killed by civilians , while one was shot by the @entity156			0
expats who publicly express sympathy for the opposition risk deportation			0
recently an @entity162 teacher was kicked out of @entity3 for writing articles critical of the government			2
between the blatant repression of 2011 and the recent reactionary measures ahead of august 14 , there has also been an insidious attack on freedom of expression and due process in @entity3			1
insulting the @entity172 on @entity173 or " inciting hatred " against the security forces will land you in jail , while activists are spending months in detention before trial -- often without access to a lawyer			0
torture and forced confessions are reportedly still ongoing , and no one has been held accountable for any of the alleged state crimes perpetrated over the past two years			1
on the contrary , @entity3 's prime minister was recently filmed thanking a suspected torturer for his services and promising his supporters impunity			2
the prospects for @entity3 's pro-democracy movement are bleak , especially without @entity6 support			1
@entity195 's recent call for meaningful reform in @entity3 was disconcertingly vague , and in his september 2012 address to the @entity198 , @entity195 failed to mention @entity3 despite expressing the need to support freedom elsewhere in the @entity202 world			1
the unrest in @entity3 has also provided many commercial opportunities for @entity6 companies and individuals			1
@entity162 arms sales to @entity3 since the year 2000 have totalled $ 1.4 billion , and the @entity3 government have paid more than $ 32 million to @entity209 and @entity211 - based public relations companies to help whitewash human rights abuses			0
in 2011 , the @entity3 authorities used @entity162 - made tear gas on protesters , and @entity217 police chief @entity216 went to @entity3 to help " reform " the police			0
some of the @entity3 police have even received training from the @entity162 military			0
the current @entity162 position can be explained by the fact the @entity3 government allows the @entity162 to keep a naval base on the island -- and as long as @entity162 - @entity134 tensions continue , @entity3 's strategic value will remain high			0
unfortunately for @entity3 's pro-democracy movement , the @entity162 are not going to risk upsetting the @entity3 government by pressuring for too much " meaningful " political reform			1
this continued @entity162 support for a brutal regime is leading to increased resentment towards the @entity162 government by many @entity3 , who feel let down by a nation that claims to support those who aspire to greater freedom , democracy , and liberty			2
