-- it 's still not clear what the future holds for @entity5 football after a child sex abuse scandal implicated top @entity8 officials and placed a former assistant coach behind bars			1
that was the message from @entity13 president @entity12 , who spoke with @entity14 in his first public comment on the matter during an interview broadcast monday			1
@entity12 said he does n't want to " take anything off the table " regarding @entity13 - imposed penalties , adding that he 'd " never seen anything as egregious as this in terms of just overall conduct and behavior inside a university			1
" " what the appropriate penalties are , if there are determinations of violations , we 'll have to decide , " he said			1
new @entity33 accusations date back to1970s the possibility for the so - called " death penalty " -- meaning the potential cancellation of some state grants , recruiting activities and up to two football seasons -- has since drummed - up questions of whether @entity8 will lose a huge revenue generator just as analysts predict a flood of lawsuits following @entity47 's conviction and a scathing internal review			1
" they are going to get pounded in civil litigation , " said @entity0 legal analyst @entity49 , after a university - funded report blamed school officials for empowering @entity47 to continue his abuse			1
the 267 - page review -- led by former fbi director @entity57 -- implicated ousted university president @entity58 , fired head coach @entity59 and ex-administrators @entity60 and @entity62 , whose attorneys blasted the findings , calling the report a " lopsided document " that lacked access to critical witnesses			1
more storms looming for @entity8 in wake of @entity57 report oral arguments for pretrial motions against @entity62 and @entity75 are scheduled for the morning of august 16 in @entity76 , @entity77			1
the two men are charged with lying to the grand jury and failing to report child sexual attacks			1
@entity47 , meanwhile , is awaiting sentencing on 45 counts of abuse			2
but attorneys for @entity58 said in a statement tuesday that @entity57 investigators ignored " the conclusions of a far more independent and thorough investigation of dr. @entity58 conducted simultaneously by federal officials responsible for our national security			2
" " dr. @entity58 has for some time held a top secret security clearance in connection with his work with the federal government			2
this clearance required a re-review when the @entity47 matter surfaced in november , " the statement said			2
" federal investigators then conducted a four - month investigation of their own in which they interviewed many of the same individuals the @entity57 group interviewed and other relevant individuals @entity57 did not interview			1
at the conclusion of the investigation the government reaffirmed dr. @entity58 's clearance			2
" the ex president 's attorneys then blasted @entity57 -- who offered no comment tuesday in response to the accusations -- for not mentioning that investigation in his report			1
read the report here ( @entity121 ) meanwhile , the scandal 's potential for further repercussions seems to be on the minds of many in the football - dominated town of @entity129			2
" i think it 's crazy to make the students suffer , " said @entity130 , a 21 - year - old senior			2
" what about the seniors ? " she asked rhetorically			2
" it 's unfair that they have to suffer for other people 's actions			0
" the @entity13 imposed similar sanctions against @entity140 following a payments - to - athletes scandal in 1987 , forcing that school to give up the following football season			1
and while @entity59 earned an almost cult - like following among @entity8 fans during his 61 years of coaching , vestiges of his legacy have gradually disappeared after @entity57 's report determined that @entity59 could have done more to stop the attacks and may not have told the grand jury all that he knew			1
on tuesday , @entity152 -- where in 1950 @entity59 earned a @entity154 degree -- approved a decision to permanently remove his name from the school 's annual award for outstanding male freshman athlete , in place since 1993			0
the school is also currently reviewing his status as a part of @entity165 's @entity164 , where he was inducted in 1977			0
at @entity129 , student organizers changed the name of a popular camp - out ahead of football games from " @entity170 " to " @entity171 , " while on a famous local mural , a halo painted above the image of the former head coach was removed			0
airborne banner : take down @entity59 statue name changes also took hold at the @entity181 headquarters in @entity182 , @entity183 , with the firm 's president announcing earlier this month that it would swap out the name of the @entity187 , a child care facility at the company 's headquarters			1
and while no decision has yet been made on the fate of the famous @entity59 statue that stands outside @entity194 , a small plane flew over campus tuesday carrying a banner that read , " take the @entity198 or we will			0
" others , however , continue to show support for their old coach , who died in january from lung cancer			0
" i think his statute needs to remain where it is , " @entity130 said			0
" he built up half our school , and was not only a coach			0
" the school 's board of trustees , whose firing of @entity59 prompted student protests , also showed its support for the former coach while pledging reforms and vowing to hold the school more accountable			0
last week , the board made it made clear that it would back a lucrative retirement deal the university made with @entity59 in the same month that he testified to the grand jury			0
the woman who stood up to @entity59 " contracts are contracts , " board of trustees chair @entity229 said friday during a trustee meeting in @entity232 , @entity77			0
" and no , there 's no plan to ( change ) that			0
" according to the university website , @entity59 's amended contract -- which now benefits his estate -- was finalized in august 2011 and totaled $ 5.5 million in payouts and benefits , which included a $ 3 million bonus and title as head football coach emeritus if he retired at the end of the 2011 season			0
the package , which was published online in april , also included a $ 425,000 head coach bonus , $ 900,000 in television and radio revenue , $ 250,000 in debt forgiveness , use of the university 's luxury box , use of the school 's hydrotherapy equipment and $ 1,000 monthly payment to @entity59 's wife for the rest of her life , among other benefits			0
report : @entity8 leaders disregarded victims , ' empowered ' @entity47 key passages from @entity8 internal review report opinion : @entity59 was a coward @entity0 's @entity269 contributed to this report			0

@entity13 president @entity12 says he does n't want to " take anything off the table "
@entity12 , in @entity14 interview , says he has " never seen anything as egregious "
" what the appropriate penalties are *...* we 'll have to decide , " @entity12 told @entity14 .
