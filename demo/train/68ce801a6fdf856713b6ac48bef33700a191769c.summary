-- all eyes this week are on @entity2 , which looks set to move forward with a provocative long - range missile launch			1
last month , @entity4 announced it would launch a rocket carrying a satellite sometime between thursday and april 16 to mark the 100th anniversary of its founder , @entity8			1
@entity10 , the @entity11 and @entity12 see the launch -- which would violate @entity15 resolutions -- as a cover for a long - range ballistic missile test			1
and a @entity12 intelligence report says it 's likely to precede a nuclear test , as it did in 2006 and 2009			1
@entity4 insists its intentions are good and have invited foreign journalists , including @entity0 correspondent @entity23 , to view the secret launch site			1
@entity0 on monday interviewed @entity25 , an international security analyst from the @entity26 , on " @entity27 " to help explain the tense situation : @entity0 : this whole parading the journalists through -- letting people see -- is this @entity32 bragging internally ? is it sending a message to the international community ? both ? @entity25 : it 's a good question			1
often when @entity2 acts out , its purpose is to communicate with the broader world , communicate to the @entity11 or to @entity10 or @entity12			1
this is really about internal messaging , being able to go to its own public and say , " look , all these @entity46 journalists are here , we 're really important , we 're really a big deal			0
" and why do i say it 's internally driven ? because they are going through a political transition			2
this young guy , this 20 - something - year - old , has taken over for his father ( @entity54 ) , and he 's in the middle of trying to consolidate his position			1
and it 's the 100th anniversary of @entity8 's birth			2
... they 've been planning big events for years now for this			0
so this is all about regime legitimacy and talking to the @entity2 people and the military , the elites in the military			1
@entity0 : @entity0 saw what appears to be a satellite			2
i think most of the media there agree that there definitely is a satellite for this rocket , to launch this satellite into space			2
... we also know that this is a country that has nuclear ambitions , no matter how nascent it is or successful it might be			2
@entity83 : yes , well , you know , this missile is not the greatest missile in the world			1
there are two characteristics if you have a modern missile program : one is solid fuel , and the other is a modern - guidance system			2
this missile has neither of those			0
and four tests , four long - range missile tests over like 15 years , is not a very active missile program			1
it 's more like a tube filled with gasoline than it is anything else			0
the big worry is they 're going to fire it up there , and it will get wobbly on them and start to veer off course like the last two did			0
that 's the real concern i have : not the missile itself but that the missile might stray into foreign airspace and that @entity10 or @entity12 might feel inclined to shoot it down and then suddenly we 're off to the races with an international incident			2
@entity0 : are we looking at a scenario where we 're going to see a couple of missiles get launched or troops marching down to the ( demilitarized zone ) ? should people be legitimately scared about this ? ... @entity83 : well , i think it is about trying to impress the family and the military			2
i do n't think they 're going to march a lot of people toward the @entity132			0
i think that would be provocative			0
certainly , you could see other missile tests			0
that 's a good question			0
they 've done that in the past , short - range missiles			1
but i 'm afraid what we 're really looking at here , further down the road , is there 's going to be the missile test , then there 's going to be international reaction , and then ( @entity2 ) is going to have to push back			1
so i would not rule out a nuclear test sometime later this year if this continues to ratchet up			1
@entity0 : this is obviously very provocative behavior by the @entity2 , even after there was just this highly publicized deal for food for this starving country			2
so what 's the point ? what are they trying to do ? @entity83 : that 's the $ 100,000 question , and we really do n't have an answer here			1
now i know lot of people who have been following this over the years			0
they sort of think this is the same old , same old -- that we cut a deal and they 've broken the deal ; they got something , but they did n't live up to their promises			0
well , that 's not what 's happening here			0
there was a deal , and we really had n't given them anything yet			0
we have n't given them the food aid			0
so that tells me one ( of ) two things happened			0
either there was some misunderstanding about the contents of that deal -- the @entity11 thought one thing , the @entity2 the other -- or maybe that deal got back to @entity4 and then ran into trouble there			1
maybe the military pushed back , or there was something else going on			0
but at this point , we do n't know the reason			0
if we had an answer to that question , that would tell us what 's going on inside @entity2			1
it 's the most opaque society in the world -- more than @entity202 , more than any other place on @entity204 -- so we really do n't know what 's going on .			0

@entity2 appears moving ahead with plans to launch a long - range missile
analyst @entity25 *discusses* @entity4 's possible *motivations*
@entity83 sees some posturing going on , legitimacy *building* for @entity2 's new leader
he says he thinks situation could *escalate* into a nuclear test like it did in 2006 and 2009
