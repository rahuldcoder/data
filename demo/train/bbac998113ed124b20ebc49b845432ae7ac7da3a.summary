@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 used to beat people			2
but he says he was pressured to do it by his boss			2
@entity3 was once a senior official of the @entity8 , reporting directly to church leader @entity9			1
he says that @entity11 's leadership fostered a culture of violence among its top ranks and that @entity19 " constantly pushed me to get physical with people " during his time among its top ranks			1
" and i 've got to tell you , i 've admitted to some , to doing a few of those , " @entity3 said			2
" but not like he did			2
" @entity3 broke with @entity11 in 2004 after 27 years			2
other former members support his accusation , telling stories about @entity19 kicking , punching and choking members of the @entity28 , a religious order that is the church 's international leadership team			1
the church emphatically denies @entity9 abused anyone or encouraged anyone else to assault subordinates			1
the only abusers , it says , were two of today 's accusers			2
meanwhile , in dozens of affidavits , e-mails and interviews , church supporters -- including members of its leadership and the former wives of some of the accusers -- are defending @entity19 and attacking the credibility of those who have spoken out			1
@entity8 spokesman @entity52 said it was @entity3 's physical abuse of other church officials that led to him being removed from his job			1
scientology under scrutiny " the thing mr. @entity9 is known for , and has been from the very beginning , is he cleans house , " @entity52 said			1
" he is someone who makes sure that people who do things that should n't be done , they 're removed			2
" @entity9 has led @entity11 since the 1986 death of its founder , science fiction writer @entity66			1
through a church spokesman , @entity9 declined to be interviewed for this report			1
there is no physical evidence to support the accusations against him , just as church affidavits attacking the accusers and supporting @entity9 can not be independently verified			1
but what both sides appear to agree on is that at least for a time , there were periodic beatings within @entity11 's upper management			2
while they disagree on who was responsible for it , both sides say top officials used physical abuse as a means of discipline and intimidation			2
during that period , no one called police			2
@entity3 is the highest - ranking member of the @entity8 to speak against @entity19			1
he was @entity11 's " inspector - general " and part of the @entity28			2
members live behind the guarded walls of @entity11 's 500 - acre international headquarters outside @entity0 , provided with room and board and a $ 50 - a - week paycheck			1
they sometimes wear naval - style uniforms , and their billion - year contracts with the church are a pledge not only for this lifetime , but for many others they believe are still to come			1
but during that time , @entity3 and others said @entity9 -- @entity3 's immediate superior -- frequently assaulted subordinates			1
he said @entity108 , the church 's spokesman until 2007 , bore the brunt of the attacks			1
in a 2000 meeting , he said @entity9 pinned @entity108 against a table " and was whacking him upside the head , " then began choking him and eventually threw him to the ground by his neck			1
" he had marks on his neck for a week , " @entity3 said			2
he 's not the only one to describe @entity108 being badly beaten			0
@entity119 , who helped run @entity11 's @entity120 in @entity0 , said she saw @entity9 choke @entity108 during a meeting before she left the church in 2005			1
" he grabs @entity108 around the neck , swings him around in one of the office chairs that swings around and is choking him , holding his neck , and @entity108 's just , like , grabbing the side of his chair , struggling , like , not knowing what was going on , " @entity119 said			1
" his face is turning red , and the veins are popping in his neck , and i 'm going , ' what the hell is going on ? ' " in 2007 , the @entity133 asked @entity108 about allegations that @entity9 had beaten him			1
he denied the reports , calling them " absolute rubbish			0
" he left the church soon afterward and now corroborates @entity3 's account , telling @entity2 that @entity9 physically assaulted him about 50 times			1
he says he , too , got physical with subordinates			0
@entity141 , a marketing manager for the church , said @entity9 attacked him several times , including once during a marketing meeting			1
" he jumped up on the conference room table , like with his feet right on the conference room table , launched himself across the table at me -- i was standing -- battered my face and then shoved me down to the floor , " @entity141 said			0
@entity141 spent 35 years as a scientologist before leaving the church in 2005			1
@entity152 , a construction manager for the church , left the same year , because , he says , he could no longer accept @entity9 's violence			1
" @entity9 asked me a question , and i could n't tell you what the question is			1
do n't remember , " @entity152 said			0
but , he added , " the next thing i knew , i have been smacked in the face and knocked down on the ground ... in front of all these people			0
this is the pope knocking me to the ground			0
" in addition to leaving @entity11 , @entity108 , @entity167 , @entity141 and @entity3 are now divorced			0
their former wives , who remain high - ranking members of the @entity28 , are joining @entity11 leaders in painting them as " bitter " former employees who are now colluding against the church			1
all four spoke to @entity2 in a joint interview monday , along with other church officials			2
@entity108 's ex-wife , @entity176 , said the only time she saw any sign that her husband had been beaten was when he was attacked " totally @entity180 " by @entity3			0
" i know every square inch of @entity108 's body , " she said			0
" i know everything that 's ever happened to him , every accident , every time he broke his wrist			0
i 've been with him , we 've been together all our lives -- it 's utterly ridiculous , and it is n't true			0
" @entity3 's ex-wife , @entity192 , calls him " a liar " and " totally psychotic			0
" " he 's alleging that when he left in 2004 , it was because he witnessed mr. @entity9 beating somebody up or whatever			1
right after he left , i 'm the first person he called			0
he called me right away			0
and it never came up , " she said			0
@entity152 's ex-wife , @entity200 , said she " never saw one scratch " on her husband			0
" i never saw one bruise , i never saw one black eye -- nothing , " @entity200 said			0
" nor did he complain about anything personally			0
and he would 've told me , because any , anything that would happen , i would know about			0
and besides that , that 's not the character of mr. @entity9			1
" @entity211 ' ex-wife , @entity210 , said he " never mentioned one thing " about any abuse			0
" to the contrary , he mentioned to me how much mr. @entity9 supported him , how much he believed in him , " @entity210 said			1
@entity52 , who replaced @entity108 as @entity11 's spokesman , said that @entity3 was to blame for the beatings and that @entity9 stripped him of his authority as he learned of the problem in 2001			1
scientology officials say they tried to offer @entity3 counseling , but he refused their efforts and left the church three years later			2
after that , @entity52 said , @entity3 and other ex-members " ganged up " to take on their old religion			2
the church says @entity152 was violent and wasted millions of church dollars during his time in the @entity28			2
it accuses @entity108 of physically attacking his subordinates and says @entity141 has attended rallies with an anti-scientology movement called @entity233			0
" these are individuals who have proven not only that they would lie , but that they will get other people to lie , " @entity52 said			0
" it 's not much of a stretch for them to all get together , corroborate their stories , find some other people who have left years ago to try and corroborate it even more , and then come to news media and attack the very person who removed them			0
" but @entity141 said that was " absolutely not true			0
" " @entity9 was the one leading this whole physical violence kick , and it was him who was beating people up , " he said			1
@entity3 calls the accusations against him " outright lies			2
" " i did n't come in here saying i was @entity253 and never did anything wrong , " he said			0
" i said i 'm no angel			0
i 'm going to tell you i was involved in this			0
but for @entity259 's sake , to make it sound like i perpetrated the whole thing is just a complete and utter fabrication			0
" @entity3 said he never raised the issue with anyone besides his wife because of the power @entity19 wields , including excommunication			0
@entity141 said church members are " not going to say anything " critical of the chairman , and he would have lied to the police himself while he remained a member			1
" it 's like the battered wife , " he said			0
" the police show up and say , ' why are you all bruised ? ' and she says , ' i just fell down the stairs			0
' she defends the husband			0
" but the church 's defense raises a question of who knew what , when and what was done to stop the abuses -- which its leaders say is a matter @entity9 handled personally , and internally .			1
