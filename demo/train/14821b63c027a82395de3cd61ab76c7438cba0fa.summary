-- frequent flyer programs are meant to breed passenger loyalty			1
the logic goes that if travelers can earn free tickets and preferential treatment by flying one airline or alliance , they will			0
a new study shows that this is n't always the case			0
a poll of 1,005 @entity14 citizens conducted by @entity15 found that 40 % of those signed up to airline loyalty schemes never redeem miles , which , one would imagine , slightly defeats the purpose			1
given the many seeming limitations associated with them -- blackout dates , minimum spends , expiry dates -- it 's not surprising			0
" it 's ironic that what is meant to be a key benefit for travelers becomes a key frustration quite quickly , " says @entity26 , product director for @entity15			0
@entity32 , the president of @entity33 , which consults airlines on how to build and improve their loyalty schemes , says he does n't find the study surprising			1
" the @entity14 is a bit of an enigma in the market , as their three largest airlines do n't encourage people to sign up to their programs , " he says			1
@entity45 ' scheme , titled the @entity46 , is almost exclusively geared towards business travelers , he says , while neither @entity48 nor @entity49 have designated programs			2
is that seat free ? still , if a good loyalty scheme is rated on the ease of acquiring a reward seat , the @entity14 carriers are n't the only ones letting customers down			2
@entity33 recently conducted research as part of the @entity60			0
throughout march , they made 7,560 queries for free seats on 25 leading airlines , and tallied the percentages that were available			0
@entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 tied for top spot , each able to accommodate queries 100 % of the time			0
@entity71 and @entity72 tied for last place , with only 36.5 % of requests resulting in a potential booking			1
read more : @entity76 rolls out new @entity77 the discrepancy , @entity32 says , simply comes down to the fact that some airlines think making reward seats available is good business practice , while others just do n't see it as a priority			1
arguably , some airlines are more interested in selling reward miles to third parties , such as banks , who can distribute the miles as rewards to their own customers			2
the practice is a multi-billion dollar earner for many carriers			0
" they love cashing the checks from the banks , they just hate to give up those seats , " quips @entity32			0
more bang for your buck another major grievance for those polled by @entity15 was the lack of affordability of reward seats , with 60 % complaining it takes too long to earn enough miles to get anything of value			2
@entity113 , the cofounder of frequent flyer community milepoint.com , and a consultant on the @entity117 , which recognizes airlines with the best loyalty schemes , notes that some carriers have hidden value that one might not realize from simply skimming their policy page online			1
infographic : what we spend on business travel " @entity132 are particularly good , " he says ( the airline recently won four @entity129 's for their @entity131 program )			1
" they have frequent promotions that allow members to redeem international awards at just half the usual miles			2
" the best part is that @entity132 are partnered with @entity71 , meaning if a member of @entity71 's @entity142 program ca n't find the reward seat they want at the price they want , they could always try using those miles to book with @entity132			1
does it make you loyal ? as only 60 % of those polled seem to make use of their frequent flyer program , it 's understandable to question whether these schemes succeed in building allegiance to a brand			1
@entity32 says sadly , it 's a difficult prospect to measure			0
" if we had an airline that would turn their program off , we would have empirical evidence one way or another , but no one has done that , because these programs are a weapon no one wants to be without			0

recent survey found 40 % of passengers never redeem loyalty miles
many airlines do n't see frequent flyer programs as a business priority
