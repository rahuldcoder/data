@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 faced the most painstaking moment of parenthood the past week when he had to ask two of his young sons whether they were sexually molested at @entity8			1
all throughout this working - class neighborhood , hundreds of parents have been holding similar conversations , searching for the right vocabulary for body parts in talking to their kids as young as kindergarten - age			1
the moment has marked a collective loss of innocence for the @entity21 immigrant enclave , where the chimes of a church bell tower sing on the half - hour and front yards yield a cornucopia of lemon and orange trees			1
if it was n't shocking enough to discover that a former teacher allegedly photographed his pupils in adult - like bondage with a suspected semen - filled spoon next to their mouths , an equally disturbing aftermath now roils the @entity37 - mission - style homes and flats			2
parents must ask their kids whether they appear in the now 600 photos found by detectives			1
the difficulty of such questioning is compounded by how such open talk is taboo in their culture , parents said in @entity37			1
" a parent is n't prepared to have such a conversation -- just trying to figure out what kind of words to use , " said @entity3 , a 42 - year - old painter whose front yard has a full view of the turquoise - and - mustard - colored facade and school entrance			1
playful murals of kids , jungle beasts , and leaders ranging from @entity60 to @entity61 adorn the two - story exterior			1
" i told them they could tell me anything , " @entity3 said in an interview at his house , with his sons playing in the family car			0
" do n't be afraid			0
you can confide in me			0
" two of his five sons attend @entity8 , in third and sixth grades			1
" this is a very grave problem -- something very serious , " @entity3 said			0
" they said they were n't touched at all -- on their buttocks , their penis or testicles			0
" his son @entity82 , a third - grader , seemed to display a naivete of the matter that would be expected out of any 9 - year - old			2
" i was like ... , " he said , pausing , " kind of uncomfortable -- because you do n't know if any of the teachers are coming back			0
" it was like somebody was going to send me to somebody 's classroom , " he said about being asked about inappropriate touching			2
@entity93 , who has two daughters enrolled at @entity8 , said parents have agonized over asking their children about their teachers			1
" in the @entity102 culture , it 's a conversation that is like a taboo , " said @entity93 , whose daughters are enrolled in fourth and fifth grades			1
" it 's a very uncomfortable conversation			1
but we have to do it			0
" the kids were shy , " @entity93 said			2
" one of my girls said , ' i do n't want to hear anything about that teacher			0
' " " that teacher " is 30 - year teaching veteran @entity8 , 61 , who was arrested last week and is accused of taking the bondage photos of more than two dozen students in his classroom			1
on thursday , @entity119 investigators announced they have found 200 more photos allegedly taken by @entity121 , who has been charged with 23 felony counts of lewd acts with pupils , according to a sheriff 's spokesman			2
authorities have been able to identify pupils in 175 of the 200 photographs and they are trying to identify those in the remaining 25 , said sgt. @entity131 of @entity132			0
authorities declined to provide further details			0
authorities now have a total of 600 photographs allegedly taken by @entity121 , and in further example of their perverse nature , some of them also feature a large three - inch cockroach crawling on kids ' faces , authorities said			1
a year ago , the school board fired @entity121 in the wake of an investigation into him that began more than a year ago ; @entity121 appealed his termination but he dropped the appeal and resigned last spring , @entity150 said			2
@entity121 is now being held in lieu of $ 23 million bond , authorities said			0
in their expanding investigation into alleged teacher sexual misconduct at @entity8 , authorities this week also charged a second teacher , @entity159 , 49 , of @entity160 , @entity1 , whom the school board fired tuesday			1
@entity159 pleaded not guilty tuesday to three felony charges of lewd acts with a female pupil under the age of 14			0
as the controversy unfolded , the @entity8 has decided to restaff the entire school			1
the school board closed the 70 - teacher school to kids and their parents tuesday and wednesday so that the system could conduct the wholesale restaffing			1
that decision has upset many parents , who are angry that the school 's good teachers are being punished -- by being transferred to another school -- because of crimes allegedly committed by a couple of other teachers			1
on wednesday , the new school staff was being trained in the @entity8 auditorium , said one of the teachers , special education assistant @entity185			1
the 1,400 - student school is scheduled to reopen with entirely new staff on thursday			2
in an interview on the school campus during a break in the training , @entity185 described the auditorium mood as " optimistic , " though new teachers are facing a daunting task of taking over a school mid-year , with state assessment exams coming up in two weeks			2
" it looks good in there because everyone is doing their job and doing the best they can , " @entity185 said			0
a 16 - year teaching veteran , @entity185 said she was specially selected to work at @entity8 ; she was assigned to the school system 's @entity205 until she was told of her @entity8 assignment tuesday			1
as an indicator of how the school sits in a low - income area , all of @entity8 's 1,400 students receive a free or reduced - price meal under the federal school lunch program			1
the student enrollment is 98 % hispanic and 2 % @entity216 ; 56 % of the students are learning @entity218 , according to the school system			2
@entity185 , 36 , said she and the new faculty were being trained on how to include social skills in their lesson plans -- so that kids can adjust to the sudden change of having all new teachers			0
" the teachers are concerned on how the children are going to feel , " @entity185 said			0
despite the optimism , there were anxieties , @entity185 said			0
" it 's a rat race : everyone is trying to figure out who 's who			0
this is all our first day here , " @entity185 added			0
@entity237 , who has a daughter enrolled in fifth grade at @entity8 and whose four other children graduated from the school , said she was worried that @entity8 's state test scores would suffer when the exams are administered later this month			1
@entity8 is a kindergarten - through - sixth - grade school located in unincorporated @entity119 within the @entity245 area , about 6 miles south of downtown @entity119			1
the school struggles academically , according to its website : " the 2011 @entity248 report indicates that in the areas of language arts and mathematics our students did not meet the proficiency target rate of 67.6 % in ( @entity218 / language arts ) and 68.5 % in math. all of our subgroups did not meet @entity248 targets			0
" those results worry @entity237			0
" the test scores are going to get worse -- to fall even lower , " @entity237 said , joined by several other mothers standing by the flag pole in front of the school entrance			0
she and the half - dozen other mothers denounced the complete reconstitution of the school staff , from cafeteria to classroom to principal 's office , she said			1
" the school is already below standards , " @entity237 added			0
" there are good teachers here , too , " said @entity273 , who has two children at @entity8			2
she will miss the principal , she said			0
" the principal is always telling the students , ' go for it ! study hard ! i come from @entity21 too , ' " @entity273 said			2
" he was a motivator			0
