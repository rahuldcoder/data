-- a @entity2 judge has ordered prosecutors to release their files on the deaths of patients at a @entity8 hospital in the days following @entity9 , finding that no related legal cases are in the works			1
@entity13 district judge @entity12 ruled that investigators ' records of the @entity17 deaths do n't involve " criminal litigation which is either pending or which can be reasonably anticipated , " so they have to be disclosed under state open records laws			1
it 's the second such order by a state judge , following a 2007 decision that was vacated by an appeals court			1
hospital workers identified only as @entity25 and @entity26 had sued to block the public release of the file , claiming the records are covered by grand jury secrecy rules , that they should have been considered confidential informants and that releasing the documents would violate their privacy			1
@entity0 and the @entity34 are among the parties to the lawsuit , which also included state and local prosecutors			2
" we are glad that the @entity2 court has recognized that the investigatory file into the deaths that occurred at @entity17 in the days following @entity9 can no longer be withheld from disclosure under the public records laws , " @entity0 said in a statement on the decision			1
" @entity0 remains committed to covering @entity8 post-katrina			2
" the @entity47 sent the case back to the district court in july to rule on whether criminal litigation in the case was expected , leading to the ruling received today			0
there was no immediate word on whether any of those parties would appeal , but @entity56 , one of the lawyers who represented @entity0 , said she expected someone will do so			2
" unless everyone is going to fold up their tent , which seems unlikely , we 're in for another several months of appeals , " @entity56 said			0
the case stems from allegations that several seriously ill , mostly elderly patients had been euthanized by medical staff at @entity67 following the 2005 hurricane , when floodwaters rose around the hospital and conditions inside deteriorated			0
a doctor and two nurses were arrested in connection with the deaths , but a grand jury declined to bring charges against them in 2007			1
@entity0 was the first to report the allegations of euthanasia , six weeks after the hurricane			2
then - @entity2 attorney general @entity82 ordered the arrest of dr. @entity84 and two nurses on preliminary charges of second - degree murder in the deaths of four of the patients			0
@entity82 said the four , who ranged in age from their early 60s to their early 90s , were given a " lethal cocktail " of morphine and another depressant , midazolam hydrochloride			0
experts he consulted reported that of all the people who died in @entity9 , only at @entity17 was that combination of drugs to blame			0
@entity84 and the nurses , @entity104 and @entity105 , denied the charges , and their attorneys said they acted heroically by staying to treat patients rather than evacuate			0
@entity82 gave @entity104 and @entity110 immunity in exchange for their testimony , but in july 2007 , a grand jury refused to indict @entity84			1
then - @entity8 district attorney @entity115 called the case closed and said he would no longer pursue it			0
but the grand jury never heard testimony from five specialists who advised @entity82 that the patients were deliberately killed with overdoses of drugs			1
all five were brought in by @entity82 's office to analyze the deaths , and concluded the patients were homicide victims .			0

judge says no pending cases *justify* *keeping* file closed
@entity0 had *sought* the records and *praised* the decision
a grand jury refused to bring charges in 2007
an appeal of the latse decision is likely , lawyer says
