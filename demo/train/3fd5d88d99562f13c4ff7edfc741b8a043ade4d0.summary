-- more than a week after announcing two vacationers had contracted hantavirus -- one of them fatally -- @entity5 said monday that authorities have determined another person died after contracting the disease while visiting the park			1
in addition to this fatality , @entity5 said in a news release that officials had identified " a probable fourth case of hantavirus			1
" all four cases involve people who stayed at the park 's popular @entity17 in mid-june			1
the park said its officials are trying to reach those who vacationed in these " tent cabins " from june through this month , when the accommodations were thoroughly cleaned , and urge them to get medical help if they show any symptoms of hantavirus			1
hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome is a rare but often fatal lung disease that kills about a third of those who get infected			1
@entity31 , @entity5 's superintendent , noted that people typically do n't fall ill with hantavirus until between one and six weeks after they are exposed			1
" the health of our visitors is our paramount concern , and we are making every effort to notify and inform our visitors of any potential illness , " @entity31 said			0
two contracted hantavirus while visiting @entity5 in the @entity43 , the carriers of hantavirus are deer mice , cotton rats , rice rats and white - footed mice , according to the @entity48			1
the virus can be present in the rodents ' urine , droppings and saliva , and is spread to people when they breathe in air contaminated with the virus , the @entity48 says			0
the virus is not communicable from person to person			0
earlier this month , the @entity60 said two state residents who came down with the disease may have been exposed to mice droppings or urine that contained hantavirus while staying at the park			1
an unidentified 37 - year - old man from the @entity68 died in late july , said dr. @entity69 , chief of the department 's vector - borne disease section			2
a @entity74 woman in her 40s survived and is recovering , @entity72 told @entity0			0
the two stayed in separate locations at the village , which contains about 400 canvas tent and wooden cabins			2
@entity5 ranger and spokesman @entity81 described the cabins as " very sparse but comfortable			2
" park officials have not given details about the one new confirmed case or the " probable " one			1
officials have focused on deer mice , common in the high - elevation eastern @entity91 region			2
the mice are gray or brown on top , with white bellies			0
their ears have no fur			0
" rodents can infest a whole range of these structures , " @entity72 said			0
" deer mice can get in a hole one - quarter inch in diameter			0
" in addition to cleaning the 400 camp structures , park officials have said they 've increased routine measures to reduce the hantavirus risk			1
" you can not eliminate all the mice , " @entity72 said			0
" there are a lot of people and snacks that people bring into their tents or cabins			0
" prior to this year , @entity5 saw one hantavirus case each in 2000 and 2010			1
there is no specific treatment for a hantavirus infection , according to the @entity48 , but the earlier a patient is brought to intensive care , the better			2
diagnosis is difficult , because early symptoms of fever , muscle aches and fatigue often are confused with the flu			0
" however , if the individual is experiencing fever and fatigue , and has a history of potential rural rodent exposure , together with shortness of breath , ( that ) would be strongly suggestive of @entity139 , " the @entity48 says .			0

the national park says officials have also identified " a probable fourth case "
earlier , officials said 2 vacationers got hantavirus after visiting @entity5
