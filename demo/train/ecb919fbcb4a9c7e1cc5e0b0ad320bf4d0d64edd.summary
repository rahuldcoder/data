-- last week , the news broke that @entity3 aircraft will commence patrolling the skies over the @entity5 and @entity6			1
@entity7 reacted mildly to defense minister @entity9 's announcement			1
the @entity10 questioned @entity12 's rationale for operating off @entity14 coastlines while insisting that such flights " must be consistent with international law and conducted with due regard for the rights of other nations and the safety of other aircraft and of vessels			1
" that 's about it			1
nor should @entity7 go further than this pro forma statement			2
why ? because an informal compact preserves freedom of the seas and skies			2
coastal states grit their teeth and tolerate rivals ' presence in exchange for their own freedom to operate along foreign shores			2
it 's a form of reciprocity			1
@entity9 's announcement came the same week a @entity3 naval flotilla appeared off @entity42 's northern periphery , setting commentators abuzz @entity44			1
but prime minister @entity48 's government , like the @entity46 administration , struck the right , low - key note vis - @entity50 - vis that voyage			1
defense spokesmen noted that the @entity3 vessels -- guided - missile cruiser @entity54 , along with a three - ship retinue -- were doing nothing unlawful or especially provocative			1
and indeed they were n't			2
no one claimed the @entity3 task force passed through @entity42 territorial waters , the 12 - nautical - mile belt of sea off any coastal state 's shores			1
( although it could have done so , provided commanders complied with the rules of " innocent passage			2
" ) no one claimed it placed @entity42 security at risk			2
as coastal states will , nevertheless , @entity73 dispatched assets to keep watch			2
@entity79 men - of - war and surveillance aircraft took to sea and sky to monitor the @entity3 warships ' whereabouts and , presumably , document their activities			1
move , countermove : that 's a normal day in the life of sea services			1
why would @entity12 go to the trouble of mounting a @entity91 cruise so far from @entity3 shorelines ? @entity93 , the chronicler of the @entity95 , offers a starting point for answering such questions			1
he lists " fear , honor and interest " as three of the prime movers for human actions			2
each is probably shaping decisions in @entity12			1
take @entity93 ' motives in reverse order			2
the @entity3 leadership probably saw an interest in telegraphing how seriously it takes the @entity113 summit that has been taking place in @entity115			1
it may also want to impress prospective @entity118 buyers of @entity3 weaponry			1
displaying naval prowess in @entity42 's extended neighborhood , then , could constitute part of a sales pitch			1
artfully employed , ships remain tokens of political and economic interest , today as throughout maritime history			1
and honor ? @entity3 clearly wants to announce , yet again , its return to history			1
a painful interlude of weakness followed the @entity133 's downfall			1
sending a rejuvenated @entity134 to promenade around the region helps banish bad memories while restoring luster to @entity3 's reputation as a great power			1
on the personal level , moreover , the cruise could represent president @entity143 's way of replying to @entity48 's vow to " shirtfront , " or upbraid , @entity143 over last summer 's downing of a @entity148 airliner over @entity149			1
political leaders have been known to use implements of state to avenge personal slights			2
the international community reacted vehemently to @entity3 's proxy war against @entity149 , levying an array of sanctions			1
@entity3 's isolation is a problem of its own making , to be sure			1
but staging naval forces in the @entity91 reminds the @entity162 and its allies that @entity12 still has options			1
in all likelihood , then , a variety of motives are at work			0
and yet forbearance remains the best posture , regardless of what is behind @entity3 actions			1
why ? to uphold the principle of freedom of the seas			0
@entity42 warships and warplanes traverse the global commons -- the seas and skies beyond any coastal state 's jurisdiction , open to unfettered use by all -- every day			1
the same goes for @entity14 ships and planes , those from @entity188 and @entity189 , and on and on			0
indeed , it 's virtually impossible to project power into faraway regions or carry on marine commerce unless the commons remains open			1
such untrammeled liberty is an asset beyond price			0
accordingly , it behooves great sea powers such as @entity42 and the @entity200 -- the biggest beneficiaries of freedom of the sea -- to make every effort to keep the commons a commons			0
that means refraining from words or acts that corrode the freedom embedded in international law and practice			0
overreacting to routine use of the commons because we dislike the power using it sets a double standard : freedom for me , but not for thee			0
that 's the worst way to respond			2
better to watch , wait and keep mum until and unless a foreign navy does something unlawful			0
in a sense the seafaring world is renewing a very old argument about the law of the sea			0
@entity232 saw an ever - increasing swath of the @entity234 as " mare nostrum , " or " our sea			0
" in this view the sea was subject to ownership			0
@entity241 @entity240 , one of the forefathers of international law , countered during the 17th century with the idea of the free sea , or " mare liberum			0
" beyond the range of a cannon shot from shore -- the farthest offshore a government could exert control -- mariners were at liberty to pursue trade and commerce , project naval force , and undertake any number of seaborne ventures			0
@entity240 ' foil -- ironically , since it was @entity260 that later midwifed the liberal maritime order we know today -- was the @entity264 jurist @entity263			0
@entity263 put forth the countervailing doctrine of " mare clausum , " the closed sea			0
the gist of mare clausum was that governments were entitled to exercise sovereign jurisdiction over sea space , much as they did on dry land			0
coastal states could literally rule the waves -- just as they wielded a monopoly of legitimate force within their terrestrial frontiers			0
@entity263 insisted that @entity264 was sovereign over northwestern @entity279 waters -- including the approaches from the @entity282 high seas to @entity241 seaports			0
small wonder @entity240 wanted to deny rival @entity264 the right to dictate the terms of his homeland 's access to the sea lanes -- or cut that vital lifeline altogether			2
a similar quarrel played out in @entity292 , where @entity293 styled itself the lord of the @entity295 while the @entity241 clamored for free access			0
@entity240 ' doctrine of free seas ultimately seemed to win out			0
@entity240 remains a fixture in international - law circles , while @entity263 is a largely forgotten figure			0
but there are few permanent victories in legal debates			0
protesting deployments like @entity3 's too loudly gives @entity263 's intellectual descendants comfort -- to the detriment of freedom of the seas			1
@entity311 , for instance , claims the right to make the rules governing merchant and naval traffic crisscrossing the @entity316			0
it wants to forbid military surveillance , underwater surveys , and other endeavors explicitly permitted by the law of the sea			0
it wants to amend the system by fiat			0
@entity42 could unwittingly advance @entity311 's project			2
if @entity73 objected vehemently to plainly lawful maritime endeavors , that is , it would have implied that @entity330 has a point when it constricts freedom of the seas and skies for fellow seafaring states			0
that point being that the nearby coastal state can regulate who operates in the commons , who does n't , and on what terms			0
by soft - pedaling the @entity3 deployment , on the other hand , @entity42 denies proponents of the closed sea that aid and comfort			1
and this is a deployment worth soft - pedaling in any event			0
the @entity42 press duly pointed out that one of the four @entity3 vessels was an oceangoing tugboat , sent along in case one of the combatant ships suffers a mechanical breakdown or some other cataclysm			1
dispatching a tug as a matter of routine betokens a navy less than confident in its hardware , material upkeep and basic seamanship			0
@entity366 expeditionary forces do n't travel with tugboats			0
we do n't expect to break down at sea			0
the same goes for the @entity79 and the other highly professional services fielded by @entity200 's allies			2
@entity373 audiences notice such things -- and they detract from the political impact of a naval deployment			0
one doubts this month 's voyage will reap much benefit for @entity12			1
so let 's make softly , softly the principle guiding diplomacy toward naval voyages -- those undertaken by prospective foes as well as by allies and friends .			2

@entity387 : mild reaction correct over @entity3 's @entity5 plan
@entity3 clearly wants to announce , yet again , its return to history , @entity387 says
@entity12 doubtless feels beleaguered , he says
