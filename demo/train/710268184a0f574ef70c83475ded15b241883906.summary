@entity0 -- the world 's most influential political and business leaders are gathering in an upmarket ski resort in the @entity5 this week to discuss the biggest challenges facing society in 2012			1
six hundred miles away from the snows of @entity9 , in rainy @entity0 members of the @entity11 are celebrating 100 days since they set up camp outside @entity14 , hoping to find solutions to some of the same problems			1
the protesters have been there since october 15 last year , battling both the elements and the authorities			2
their decision to establish a protest village in the heart of @entity0 's financial district , the @entity26 , was a controversial one			1
demonstrators had first attempted to occupy the nearby @entity29 , but were quickly moved on			2
instead they pitched their tents around the steps of @entity14 's , one of the most famous landmarks in the city : a symbol of @entity0 's endurance during the @entity37 , and a site of celebration , as the venue for the wedding of @entity42 and lady @entity43 in 1981			1
the camp sparked rows between the authorities and the church , which stepped in to protect the occupiers from the police , allowing them to stay , despite threats of eviction			2
two leading members of @entity14 's later resigned over the row			1
@entity55 : occupy in memory of @entity57 @entity59 spokeswoman @entity58 says the movement has achieved a tremendous amount in its first 100 days			1
" it has been an astounding success , " she told @entity1			0
" it is very noticeable how all the political parties represented in parliament have been bringing themselves around to occupy -- we are setting agendas that others then follow			2
" protester @entity76 agrees : " we 've raised a lot of important issues , we 've made it possible to discuss a lot of subjects which were not being mentioned , and we have been able to include the public and people who are usually excluded in that discourse			0
" five years ago , if you talked about the problems of capitalism , you were branded a maniac , now even [ @entity85 @entity84 prime minister ] @entity82 is talking about the nature of capitalism ; we 've made it possible to discuss it without people accusing you of being a communist			0
" last week , the @entity26 won a high court fight to force the closure of the camp			2
the occupiers insist they will appeal , but @entity76 concedes it may be time to move on			0
" personally , i think it is time for the tents to go , " he said			0
" they have served their purpose , but i think there is a risk of us becoming too emotionally attached to them			0
" by occupying part of the @entity26 , we have found out a lot , we have raised a lot of issues : the lack of transparency , the lack of accountability , but we do n't need to be outside @entity14 's to do that any more			1
" @entity114 insists , though , that any shift away from the original site will not signify the end of @entity59 -- quite the contrary : whether or not the @entity14 's camp survives , she says , the movement itself will continue to make its presence felt in the coming weeks , months and years			1
" i think we will see day - long ' occupations ' in city centers , in shopping areas and in other locations , and i think @entity11 will spread out more into the community , " she said			0
" we have brought a lot of people together , people with specialist knowledge , who have been able to create networks of expertise , and those links , those conversations will continue , whether the physical site is there or not			0
" occupiers are already doing outreach work , giving talks in citizenship classes at local schools , and encouraging people to become more involved in democracy			0
@entity76 says this and other community work is key			0
" our society has gradually been confiscated , fragmented over the past few years , and the point of @entity11 is to help repair the severed links , to restore a sense of reciprocity and social cooperation			0
" we need to get out into the boroughs and the parishes , and to support the non-economic institutions which are trying to do the same thing , whether that means churches or @entity162			0
" and some camping will continue at @entity164 , which began as an overflow from the main site at @entity14 's , and where there is , @entity114 hopes , " no threat of eviction " -- occupiers there are hoping to create a sustainable eco village			1
@entity174 , from @entity173 , is a relatively new arrival at @entity164			0
he says @entity11 was never intended as a quick - fix			0
" it 's a long - term protest movement , " he told @entity1 , sitting in front of a wood - burner to keep warm in the drizzle			1
" we 've seen huge one - day demonstrations before -- the march against the war in @entity185 had 1.5 million people in it , but it did n't stop anything			0
" the government is supposed to be there for the people , but they do n't do anything for us when we ask , " he said , explaining that he hopes that will change , in the face of a concerted and long - lasting occupy campaign			1
fellow occupier @entity196 , back at @entity14 's , agrees			2
" we wo n't be rushed -- we are only three months into a discussion which is so big , and so important , how can you expect us to have reached a consensus already ? give us a chance , be patient			0
" but @entity196 insists that @entity11 is far more relevant to ordinary people than the @entity203 , which he says welcomes only the global elite			2
" i think @entity9 is the complete opposite of @entity11 -- @entity9 is there to represent the powerful , while we 're here to represent the people			2
we 're trying to balance things out as best we can , to show that there are alternatives to the system as it stands , to have a debate about it , but not to impose our views on people			0
" @entity9 is very exclusive , whereas we welcome anyone , we are completely inclusive -- to the point of madness sometimes , because you do get the occasional crackpot -- and everyone is listened to			2
" it seems very unequal , very unfair , because i do n't believe that [ the delegates at @entity9 ] all want to make the world a better place for everyone , and yet they are the ones holding all the tools , they are the ones with a lot of the power to do that			1
" but there are @entity234 in @entity9 too			1
they may not have made it onto the stage at the @entity203 , or be taking part in debates with the likes of @entity241 and @entity242 , but they are here all the same , in a temporary settlement of igloos and yurts near the conference center			1
blog : meeting the @entity9 protesters " we are not just here to build igloos , " @entity249 told @entity1			1
" we are here to have protests on the streets			0
" we should take the power back ; we should not let the richest 1 % have the power -- they can not be the solution for our crisis , because they are the crisis , they are responsible for the crisis			1
" and there are signs that despite the icy temperatures , relations between the two camps , occupy and the @entity203 , may be thawing			1
" there have been attempts to broker a conversation , " says @entity114			0
" it may not happen this year , but we hope it can happen in future			0
" @entity275 , @entity203 managing director , recently dropped in to the @entity9 camp to help build one of the igloos , and later hinted on @entity279 that the groups have more in common than some might think			1
" different approach , same goal : improving the state of the world			1
" @entity1 's @entity285 and @entity286 in @entity9 contributed to this story .			2
