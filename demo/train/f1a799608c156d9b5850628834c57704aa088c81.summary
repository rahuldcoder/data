" true progress is possible if you keep and open mind , listen to all sides and focus on results , " @entity1 said			2
@entity0 urged that @entity1 be confirmed " as quickly as possible			1
" @entity1 's nomination comes as the economy continues a sluggish recovery from recession , with unemployment hovering near 8 %			1
the @entity52 , among other things , oversees analysis and reporting of unemployment statistics as well as occupational safety and other wage and employment issues			0
while some indicators show improvement , economists warn some fragility remains and political leaders are divided on policy prescriptions for stronger growth			0

" the @entity52 would likely play a role in new employment programs under any comprehensive immigration reform			0
@entity1 's nomination pleased unions and workers ' rights groups , but rankled @entity25 conservatives due in part to his record at the @entity124			1
" this is an unfortunate and needlessly divisive nomination			1
the top priority of the secretary of labor should be to create jobs and higher wages for @entity4 workers			0
but mr. @entity1 has aggressively sought ways to allow the hiring of more illegal workers , " said sen. @entity131 , an @entity133 @entity132 and a senior member of the @entity135			2
" mr. @entity1 has also had a controversial tenure at the @entity124 where he has demonstrated a fundamentally political approach to the law			2
" @entity1 , who has overseen the agency 's civil rights division , has been active in several high - profile cases in recent years			1
in 2010 , he launched a probe into the law enforcement tactics of @entity147 , @entity148 , sheriff @entity149 after the lawman 's hard line anti-immigration policies led to accusations of civil rights violations			0
the @entity124 determined that @entity149 had engaged in " pattern or practice of wide - ranging discrimination against @entity158 and retaliatory actions against individuals who criticized " his department 's activities			0

@entity1 also became involved in a controversial 2008 voting rights case after it drew attention from @entity132 legislators and became the target of a @entity124 inspector general 's report			1
the watchdog concluded that that @entity124 's voting rights section lacked professionalism and pointed out pervasive warring between employees who disagreed politically			0
the case stemmed from a complaint against members of the @entity185 who stood outside a polling station in @entity187 on @entity188 dressed in boots and berets and carrying a nightstick			0

though @entity1 had not yet been confirmed to oversee the civil rights division when the decision was made , he said in testimony to inspector general @entity205 in may 2010 that politics played no part in the decision			0
@entity205 was not satisfied with @entity1 's account of the situation , saying in his report that @entity1 should have tried to get more information before testifying			1
@entity1 was not accused of any wrongdoing , but he has been criticized for not doing enough to improve what the inspector general described as a dysfunctional department			0
before rising to the @entity124 position , @entity1 led @entity218 's @entity217			2
that office is charged with " safeguarding workers , protecting consumers , providing a safety net and cultivating a thriving workforce , " according to its website			0
he also spent 12 years as an attorney in the @entity124 's civil rights division , rising to become deputy assistant attorney general in the 1990s			0
