-- may 12 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 @entity6 transcript this is a @entity9			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity13 , @entity14 : concerns about lost culture , a plan to cut college costs and a fearless flyer			1
that 's what 's ahead in today 's program			1
but we start with a tour of some international headlines			2
first up : two months later @entity26 : we begin in @entity4 , where the country paused for a moment of silence on wednesday			1
it was exactly two months after a powerful earthquake struck off the @entity4 coast			1
it was the largest quake to hit @entity4 in more than 100 years			1
and it caused a tsunami , a giant ocean wave , that rushed ashore			2
the impact on the @entity40 country was devastating			2
nearly 15,000 people were killed			2
another 10,000 are still missing			2
the quake and tsunami damaged several of @entity4 's nuclear reactors			1
the worst was this one -- the @entity47 plant			2
engineers have spent two months trying to contain the crisis			1
yesterday , the company that owns the @entity47 plant said there 's a new radiation leak from one of the reactors			1
they did n't know if the radioactive water was leaking into the sea			2
@entity4 is making some progress in its efforts to clean up and rebuild from the natural disasters			1
but it 's going to take a while , partly because the damage is so wide - spread			1
around 130,000 people in @entity4 have nowhere to live			1
temporary housing is going up , but slowly			2
@entity5 @entity66 @entity26 : next up , the north @entity68 nation of @entity5			2
this is a country that 's in the middle of a civil war that started about a month before the @entity4 earthquake			1
on one side are the forces of colonel @entity76 , @entity5 's leader for more than 40 years			1
on the other side , rebels who want @entity76 out of power			2
other countries are involved too			2
forces from the @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , and several others are part of a military coalition to protect @entity5 's civilians			1
that group is led by @entity90 - the @entity90			2
yesterday , rebels were able to take control of the airport in the city of @entity95			2
that 's been a big battle - ground between the rebels and @entity76 's forces			1
controlling the airport is important because it can provide access to humanitarian aid that 's trying to get into @entity5			1
@entity104 @entity26 : finally , we 're going to cross the @entity106 and wind up in @entity6 , a country that 's facing some major economic struggles			1
people can invest their money in places all over the world			2
so when one country -- like @entity6 -- has problems , it can have a wide impact			2
last year , the nation needed a financial bail - out and it got one from the @entity119 and @entity120			2
but part of the deal is that @entity6 has to find ways to cut its budget			0
and a lot of people are n't happy about some of the options being considered			0
yesterday , about 20,000 of them marched through the capital @entity131			0
some of these protests turned violent			0
police fired tear gas on the protesters			0
this is far from over , because there are rumors that @entity6 might need another bailout			0
@entity140 @entity142 @entity141 , @entity143 , @entity144 : it is devastating			0
it 's painful to watch the slow rise of the water			1
we ca n't start the recovery and you ca n't start the healing process until the water goes down			0
and that 's the part that is painful			1
for their safety , for the safety of others , they are not allowed back in there			0
impact of flooding @entity26 : that was the mayor of @entity163 , @entity144			1
about 600 people in his community have been forced out of their homes as flood waters rush in			0
this flooding along the @entity170 could affect people in ways you might not think about			1
for example , at the gas pump			0
some of the largest refineries in the @entity82 are located next to the river			1
there are concerns that those refineries might have to temporarily close as the flooding moves through			1
and that fear is already driving up the price of gas			0
the nationwide average went up more than a cent on wednesday			0
this next report from @entity187 looks at another unexpected threat from the floods			0
the potential loss of a cultural connection			0
( begin video ) @entity187 , @entity193 national correspondent : long before the @entity195 , there was @entity196 61			0
it was an important north / south connection that stretched from @entity198 to @entity199			0
but here 's why we 're back on @entity202 today			1
for much of that distance , @entity202 runs parallel to the @entity170			0
in fact , it 's one of the reasons it 's also known as the @entity209			1
historian @entity210 says the road , like the river , transformed life			0
@entity210 , @entity214 : it brings trade , travel , transportation			1
@entity220 : from the 1920s to the 1950s , this was a migratory route for @entity222 leaving the @entity223 looking for better economic opportunity in the @entity225			0
@entity226 , blues musician : 61 is kind of like the underground railroad of the @entity223 for the poor sharecropper fellow looking for a better way of life			0
@entity220 : a lot of culture came with them up the river and up this highway			1
highway 61 is how the blues ended up on @entity240			1
@entity241 , blues musician : 61 leads straight to @entity240			0
@entity220 : and that 's no accident ? @entity245 : that 's no accident			1
@entity248 : it was a highway of business , it was a highway of education , it was a highway of getting your doctorate , it was a highway of music , it was a highway of life			1
and it 's part of our soul in this region			1
@entity220 : but now the historic levels of the @entity170 are threatening life along @entity202			0
in town after town , from @entity265 to @entity266 , people wait to see what the water will bring down the road			0
@entity187 , @entity193 , @entity265			0
( @entity270 ) @entity271 @entity193 student news : time for the shoutout ! @entity274 , @entity275 , and @entity276			1
are all types of what ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! are they : a ) sports leagues , b ) government agencies , c ) academic degrees or @entity288 ) horse breeds ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! these are academic degrees : @entity274 , @entity275 , and @entity276			0
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! faster and @entity294 ? @entity26 : a b.a. is one of the most common degrees offered by colleges and most people spend four or five years earning it			1
but with tuition prices going up , that means more money for every year you 're in school			0
@entity304 looks at a program that cuts the costs and the time			1
( begin video ) @entity308 , @entity193 national correspondent : a bachelor 's degree at the @entity310 is a bargain , just over $ 11,000 a year for in - state students			1
but a handful here are now getting an even bigger break : working toward a degree in three years , not the usual four			0
@entity317 , who wants to be a psychiatrist , is one of them			0
were you more interested in the economic benefit or the shorter time in school ? @entity323 , @entity324 : for me personally , it was more of the shorter time in school because i do want to go to med school so , really , time is of the essence			1
i would rather get it done faster than trying to take my time and drag it out forever			1
my parents , economically , they 're like , yes , this is a gold mine , do it			0
@entity339 : a small but growing number of schools are tackling soaring tuitions by offering a three - year option			0
while some educators worry that it short circuits the college experience , proponents like @entity346 say hundreds of students here come from well below the poverty line			1
@entity353 , @entity354 , @entity356 @entity355 : the notion of a college degree that it 's affordability is just extraordinarily frightening for most families			1
@entity339 : to join the plan , students must arrive with 12 hours of college level courses completed in high school or elsewhere			1
they must know their major and they must take on a heavy course load			0
but the savings : @entity367 : we estimate this will save students around $ 8,000			1
@entity367 : almost $ 8,000 , which is about a fourth of a typical collegiate experience here			2
@entity339 : it 's tough work			2
@entity377 : if you are not driven , this is not going to work for you			0
@entity339 : but for those who are , it can mean a fast - track to even higher degrees , good jobs and less debt along the way			0
@entity304 , @entity193 , @entity355 , @entity387			0
( @entity270 ) @entity388 @entity26 : " do n't fail me ! " it 's a new documentary from @entity193 that premieres this weekend			2
the program features the three students that you see here and it uses their stories to take a look at the overall @entity82 education system			1
check out " @entity400 " when it airs this coming sunday , may 15th at 8 p.m. @entity398 and @entity399 on @entity193			0
before we go @entity26 : before we go , we 're gon na take a trip over the @entity403			0
looks like they 're installing a new part on our helicopter			0
uh , looks like you dropped something there , guys			0
and he did n't drop , he fell ! right before the after - burners kicked in on his personal jetpack ! this flight of fancy -- and air - show of awesome - ness -- lasted more than eight minutes			0
he was supposed to do the run one day earlier			0
goodbye @entity26 : but he jettisoned that idea , saying he needed a practice run			0
it looks like he pulled it off without any problems , despite the gravity of the situation			0
time for us to jet			2
when the next 23 hours and 50 minutes fly by , we 'll be back with more @entity0 .			0
