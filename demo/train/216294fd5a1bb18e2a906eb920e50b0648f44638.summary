-- a @entity2 plan to give new protection to polar bears was voted down thursday at an international conference on endangered species			1
the @entity8 delegation at the @entity9 and @entity10 ( @entity12 ) meeting in @entity13 , @entity14 , had sought a ban on the international trade of polar bear parts			1
the ban was opposed by @entity19 , home to the world 's largest population of polar bears , as well as @entity24 and @entity25			2
it failed with 38 votes for , 42 against and 46 abstentions			0
" unfortunately , politics seem to have overtaken science , " @entity29 , director of the @entity30 and the head of the @entity2 delegation to the @entity13 conference , said in a statement			0
polar bears have been listed under @entity38 of the @entity12 accords , which applies to species that are not currently threatened with extinction but may face it without restrictions on the trade of their body parts			0
the @entity2 had proposed moving polar bears to @entity47 , which applies to species threatened with extinction and effectively bans trade in their body parts			1
the @entity2 says that shrinking @entity54 ice habitat , a product of a warming climate , puts polar bear populations in a precarious position			1
two - thirds of the world 's polar bear populations could face local extinctions within 45 years due to habitat loss , the @entity57 says			1
" we are obviously disappointed that the @entity12 membership failed to give greater protection to polar bears by limiting permissible trade in polar bear pelts and other body parts , " @entity2 deputy secretary of the interior @entity63 said in a statement			1
" we will continue to work with our partners to reduce the pressure that trade in polar bear parts puts on this iconic arctic species			1
" conservation groups were outraged at the vote			0
" it 's a sad day for one of the world 's most iconic creatures , " @entity79 , ceo of @entity80 , said in a statement			0
" the world once again had a chance to take action to safeguard polar bear populations and failed , " @entity86 , @entity8 regional director of the @entity87 , said in a statement			1
" each passing year that this iconic species is not protected to the fullest , is another year closer to losing the polar bear forever			2
" @entity19 , which has 16,000 of the 20,000 to 25,000 polar bears left in the wild , says polar bear populations are not threatened and the animal does not meet the @entity99 1 criteria			1
" the polar bear does not have a small wild population , it does not have a restricted area of distribution and no marked decline has been observed , " @entity100 says on its website			0
@entity19 also says polar bear parts coming from the country are taken in subsistence hunts , not by commercial operations			1
" harvest quotas are based on principles of conservation and @entity116 subsistence , and are not market driven ; an @entity47 listing would have no conservation benefit , " the website says			0
but the @entity2 argued that parts from polar bears are traded among 70 countries and that trade encourages kills that , coupled with the habitat loss , put stress on populations that will cause them to shrink			2
about 800 polar bears are killed by subsistence hunters each year , the @entity2 says			0
hides can sell for $ 2,000 to as much as $ 12,000 , the @entity30 says			0
" as polar bear hide prices have skyrocketed , more bears are being offered at auction , and hunting levels have increased , " @entity29 said in the statement			2
" prices for polar bear pelts have doubled over the last few years , and the signs are that trade is increasing			2
all the evidence says that it is simply unsustainable so it is foolish and negligible of us to allow it to continue when polar bear numbers are diminishing , " @entity79 said			0
" it 's terrible to think that we are postponing protecting such a magnificent animal so that hunters can continue to have their payday , " he said			0
@entity63 pledged that the @entity2 would n't give up on trade restrictions			0
" we will continue to work with our partners to reduce the pressure that trade in polar bear parts puts on this iconic arctic species , even as we take on the longer term threat that climate change poses to polar bears , " he said .			1

@entity2 *wanted* effective ban on trade of polar bear parts
