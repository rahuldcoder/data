-- children in @entity3 countries are on average better problem solvers than their @entity6 and @entity7 peers , according to a new study by the @entity9			1
in 2012 the organization tested more than 85,000 15 - year - olds in 44 countries and economies on their problem solving skills , testing their ability to explore limitations or obstacles and to understand information given to them			1
while @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 were among the top - performing economies , the @entity7 scored just above the average and @entity26 and @entity27 lagged behind with lower - than - average scores			1
the @entity9 says ability to crack complex problems is key to the economic success in the future			1
" today 's 15 - year - olds with poor problem - solving skills will become tomorrow 's adults struggling to find or keep a good job , " said @entity33 , acting director of education and skills at the @entity9			1
the problems in the test were designed to be similar to those faced by many workers in every day situations -- such as using an unfamiliar mobile phone or a ticket - vending machine			2
the report says one in 10 workers faces such hurdles every day			0
but the skills become even more important in the sectors that drive developed economies -- highly skilled managerial and technical occupations			2
the pupils were also asked to consider situations involving a number of alternatives and constraints to make a decision -- for example choosing the right pain killer given sufficient details about the patient , their complaints and the available pain killers			2
in another parts , students had to solve scheduling problems for projects such as building a house or generating a flight schedule for an airline			0
one question asked the children to plan a seating plan for a birthday party according to the wishes of the individual party guests			0
try to solve it here : ( see the answers here			0
) the results suggested that one in five students in the @entity9 countries is only able to solve " very straightforward problems -- if any -- provided they refer to familiar situations , such as choosing from a catalog of furniture , showing different brands and prices , the cheapest models to furnish a room			1
" but the same students failed when put in new situations and asked to solve unfamiliar problems			0
the report says this is a consequence of education focused on various sets of rules , such as the rules of algebra			0
while algebra is important , the reports points out that in real world , applying the rules of mathematics is only the second part of finding a solution to a problem			0
" the first step -- the step computers ca n't do -- involves examining the messy set of facts in a real - world problem to determine which set of algebraic rules to apply , " it says			2
to avoid turning pupils into robots governed by a strict set of rules , teachers should encourage their students to think about skills they learned in one class -- such as reading and mathematics , and apply them when trying to solve a problem in biology or history			1
