the @entity0 has slapped stringent sanctions on @entity2 in response to the downing of @entity5 17 , believed by the @entity6 and others to have been shot down with a @entity2 - supplied @entity9 missile system by eastern @entity11 rebels			1
while the introduction of financial sanctions will create the most immediate squeeze on @entity2 , it is the crack - down on the arms trade which has triggered debate			1
future imports and exports between the @entity20 and @entity2 are now banned -- but existing contracts , including @entity24 's $ 1.6 billion @entity23 - class warships deal , are allowed to go ahead			1
but @entity2 is one of the few countries in the world that is nearly self - sufficient in its defense production , according to @entity30 's expert @entity29			1
so will the arms embargo have an impact ? here is a cheat - sheet on @entity36 's arms trade with @entity2			1
how big is the arms trade between @entity36 and @entity2 ? @entity20 countries earned $ 583 million from weapons exports to @entity2 in 2013 , the bulk of which was part - payment of the @entity23 deal , according to analysis from @entity30 's			1
@entity2 is , by comparison , the world 's second largest military exporter after the @entity6 , earning $ 13.2 billion from arms exports last year			1
its biggest customers are @entity51 and @entity52 , countries which have not joined the sanctions against @entity2			2
the industry is heavily regulated and @entity20 figures track the bloc 's arms trade by licenses approved			1
in total , @entity20 countries granted 922 licenses to sell $ 259 million worth of weapons to @entity2 in 2012 , according to the latest statistics available			1
however , according to @entity29 , the licenses -- which in the @entity64 , for example , expire after two years -- are more an " expression of intent " than indication of likely sales			0
the trade with @entity2 compares to $ 4.3 billion worth of weapons the @entity20 licensed arms companies to sell to the @entity6 what are the biggest deals ? while @entity2 is a significant player in the supply of arms , it has also leaned on @entity36 for some big deals			1
the biggest -- and now most controversial -- is the @entity23 contract of 2011 , signed by @entity24 's previous government			0
the warships are powerful vessels equipped with six helicopter landing zones			0
each of them can carry up to 16 heavy helicopters and around 500 marines			0
the first of the two carriers due to be delivered is now completing sea trials , and 400 @entity2 troops are currently training on it in the @entity24 port of @entity94			0
@entity95 , of @entity96 ( @entity96 ) , said they were @entity2 's first " serious " weapon supplied by @entity36			2
@entity2 's other significant deals include its purchase of two @entity102 engines for missile boats in 2001 , and four light transport aircraft from the @entity105 in 2012 , according to the @entity96 databases			1
details on the contracts are scarce but the @entity105 planes were reported to be worth around $ 3.2 million each			0
@entity2 also bought 60 army vehicles , reportedly worth estimated $ 24 million , from @entity111 in 2011			0
according to the @entity96 , @entity2 has also agreed to buy at least eight drones from @entity113 in 2009 , worth a reported $ 50 million			0
@entity2 was also importing arms and military equipment from @entity11 , but the @entity116 was reported saying it would phase this out within two years			2
" ironically , the loss of @entity11 as a supplier to @entity2 is far more significant that the loss of @entity36 , " @entity29 said			2
" a lot of subcontracted work for @entity2 's industrial base took place in @entity11			2
" @entity2 president @entity126 's office did not respond to a request for comment on the deals and impact of sanctions			2
why is the @entity23 deal so politically hot ? the @entity23 warships -- which experts say are " very capable weapons of mobile war " -- have landed @entity24 in a politically awkward spot			0
@entity24 foreign minister @entity138 last week argued the country is contractually obligated to deliver the ships -- but his comments were made as @entity36 relations with @entity2 deteriorated			0
@entity64 prime minister @entity143 declared the deal 's completion " unthinkable " before being slapped back by @entity138 , who echoed the phrase in reference to the @entity64 's involvement in the 2003 @entity150 invasion			0
the @entity23 deal keeps some 1,000 frenchmen and women employed in a country with a 10 % unemployment rate -- and reversing it would be costly			0
however , @entity24 president @entity156 has thrown doubt on delivery of the second ship , saying last week it " depends on @entity2 's attitude			2
" what happens next ? @entity36 leaders are trying to hit @entity2 where it hurts with the latest round of sanctions			0
as of thursday , @entity2 state - owned banks will be restricted from accessing @entity36 capital markets and exports of oil - related equipment and technology to @entity2 will be slowed or stopped by red tape			0
all new contracts for arms imports and exports between the @entity20 and @entity2 will stop , and there will be a prohibition on exporting goods and technology that can be used for both military and civilian purposes			1
but in the short - term , the arms ban is unlikely to have a significant impact on @entity2 's military might			1
" the embargo in itself does n't change anything in @entity2 military capabilities right now , " @entity184 , senior researcher with @entity96 said			0
in the long term , he said , @entity2 could feel pain from losing access to the latest high - tech defense electronic systems developed in the @entity20			1
opinion : we must end this trade in weapons of @entity196 : to punish @entity2 , @entity36 must be prepared to suffer @entity197 : @entity36 's thirst for @entity2 gas			2

as part of its sanctions against @entity2 , the @entity20 has cracked down on the arms trade with @entity204
but @entity2 is one of the few countries in the world that is nearly self - sufficient in its defense production
in the short - term , the arms ban is unlikely to have a significant impact on @entity2 's military might
