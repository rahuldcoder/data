-- you know the presidential election is in full swing when politicians are getting tough on @entity5			1
while both @entity8 and @entity9 promise to do just that , it is the @entity11 administration , being in the driver 's seat , that has been leading the charge			2
on monday , the @entity11 administration filed a trade case against @entity5 at the @entity16 , arguing that it provides subsidies to its auto and auto parts industries that hurt @entity21 manufacturers			1
if you had any doubts that the new complaint against unfair @entity5 trade practices is part and parcel of the election campaign , consider these factors			1
this week 's complaint is the third one this year , and it comes just about two months before @entity31			2
where was the administration before ? @entity34 is a key battleground state , and automotive components happen to be one of the most important segments of the local economy			2
why is @entity11 focusing on @entity5 auto subsidies now ? note also that he made the announcement in @entity34 during a campaign rally			1
tough with @entity5 ? give me a break			1
we do n't know whether @entity11 conveyed to the @entity5 what he told the @entity46 ( just let me get through the election , and i will be more flexible ) , but it 's no secret to anyone that @entity5 holds more than $ 1 trillion in @entity21 debt			1
when you owe another country that much debt , it may not be so easy to act tough			0
the @entity11 administration had plenty of opportunities to take steps that would genuinely challenge the @entity5			1
for example , it could have labeled @entity5 as a currency manipulator , which would have allowed the @entity21 to take measures such as imposing tariffs unilaterally rather than through the @entity16			1
likewise , the administration has done little to offer vigorous protection of @entity21 intellectual property rights , which impacts a much broader array of @entity21 business interests			2
and the administration has failed to take other concrete steps that would reduce @entity5 's competitive advantage			0
let me make it clear			0
i am not defending @entity5 , and i have often offered criticism of @entity5 practices and continue to do so			2
however , i find the current round of @entity5 - bashing disingenuous and brazen in its kowtowing to politically viable groups			0
what we need is an effective strategy of how to deal with @entity5 in the long term rather than engage in election season tactics			1
we should also face up to some of our own self - inflicted wounds			0
there are things under our control that undermine our competitiveness in relation not only to @entity5 but to numerous other countries			0
for a starter , maybe our government should try to tackle the huge and growing debt that makes us beholden to other countries like @entity5			0
our educational system does not provide nearly enough to prepare our graduates for the skills and knowledge that companies require to succeed in a global workplace			0
and we should reconsider regulations that discourage companies from setting up plants in the @entity21 while @entity5 looks attractive in comparison			1
instead , what we have are slogans that used to be quite popular with the @entity5 in hardline communist days , e.g. , doubling our exports in five years			0
how , exactly ? maybe the @entity11 administration and the @entity114 camp can start addressing those questions first			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity118 .			0

this week , president @entity11 announced a trade complaint against @entity5
@entity118 says politicians tend to get tough on @entity5 in election season
he says @entity11 is tackling @entity5 auto subsidies to appeal to @entity34 *voters*
