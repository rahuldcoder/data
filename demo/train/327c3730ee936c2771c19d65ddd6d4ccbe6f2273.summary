-- if there was a predominant reaction to this voter 's indecision , shared in " @entity6 " on @entity0 two weeks ago , it was incredulity			2
" the candidates have spent billions , " i was told			0
" their tv ads have replaced normal programming			0
this campaign has been longer than a life sentence			0
how can you still be undecided ? " to clarify , my indecision did not stem from an unrequited love for either candidate			2
i just could not bring myself to support either of these guys			2
a vote for @entity20 makes me a crazy , government - expanding liberal			1
i vote for @entity22 and i 'm a crazy , masochistic female			1
the truth is that voting for a candidate does n't mean you stand united on every issue			2
i can not create my own candidate , taking the best features from each then add a glowing heart and a soft , plush , huggable exterior			0
nevertheless , i have made a choice			0
i 'm young , female and decided			0
drumroll , please ... i 'm voting for @entity22			1
" well , duh , your dad 's a @entity38 strategist			0
" my father @entity40 ' affiliation has not affected my decision			1
although i respect his " suggestions , " my choices are my own , as even he would tell you			0
what has resolved this contest for me ? was it the cantankerous candidates in the last debate , fighting to fight for the safety of our great nation ? @entity53 , i found the last debate tremendously boring , except for president @entity20 's " bayonets " comment			1
ultimately , my decision came down to this : i could not rehire @entity57			1
@entity57 , manager of the @entity58 this past year , was fired after a horrible season			1
his team 's poor record was n't entirely @entity57 's fault			1
in fact , @entity58 general manager @entity65 said , " @entity57 was dealt a difficult hand			1
" no doubt @entity57 inherited a lot of problems			1
but looking ahead , there was no reason for @entity58 fans to hope that next season @entity57 would lead his team differently or deliver a better record			1
@entity20 inherited a lot of problems , too			1
in his defense , our expectations for hope and change were too high			0
unless he @entity80 - touched his way through the @entity82 , @entity20 was destined to disappoint us			1
but manager @entity20 has not achieved the goals he led us to believe he would			2
he has not turned his team around			0
you do n't keep a failing manager when there is an acceptable alternative			0
it 's time for a replacement			0
i am hoping , praying , that should he be elected , @entity22 's experience will lead to a positive shift in the economy and an increase in job creation			1
i still disagree with the governor on women 's rights			0
should he become president , i 'm going to rely on the power of the @entity103 people to protect women from those who would set the clock back			0
the @entity107 - like , growling tv ads attacking @entity22 on women 's rights are cut and choreographed to make him seem appalling			1
@entity22 might not have closed the gender - gap entirely , but at least some women suspect those ads are unrealistic , more bark than bite			2
an ad in which @entity22 says , " i would overturn @entity115 " does not include what follows , the governor stating , " but that 's not where we are			1
that 's not where @entity103 is today			0
" if @entity22 is elected , abortion is not going to become illegal			1
we will not have a government official holding our hands during our annual doctor 's visit			0
similarly , i know @entity22 is against same - sex marriage			2
one day , i expect to tell my own children there was a time where gay people could not get married , just like my parents told me of a time i could not understand , when @entity137 were not presidents but confined to the back of the bus			0
some of the progress we 've made and injustices we 've overcome will not be reversed , no matter who is president			0
" that 's not where @entity103 is today			0
" @entity22 wo n't be able to change everything			1
but what if he could change the economy ? " you can stick with what 's barely working or take a chance with [ @entity22 ] , " said @entity149 , imitating the president on " snl			1
" we 've had a losing streak , so i 'm taking a chance			0
because four years from now , if president @entity20 is finishing his last months in office and we 're deeper in debt , still praying for a winning jobs report , i 'll know i got just what i expected			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity164 .			2

@entity164 had been torn over which candidate to support
she says her decision to vote for @entity22 is based on the weak economic *recovery*
