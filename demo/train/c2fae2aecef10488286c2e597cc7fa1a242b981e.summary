-- we were told to be awake and ready to move at 4 a.m. @entity3 fighters we were with were planning to launch a dawn assault on the @entity6 city of @entity7			1
all predictions indicated it would be one of the bloodiest battles yet			2
@entity12 officials said loyalist forces would use weaponry they had n't used before			1
they did n't go into detail but it sounded ominous			2
western intelligence sources told @entity0 the fighters in @entity7 still loyal to @entity20 's ousted leader , @entity19 , had heavy artillery and would likely use it			1
@entity7 was frequently described as loyalist and @entity23			1
the night before the assault there was an edgy , giddy atmosphere on the air base where we were camped along with the force that had traveled more than 600 kilometers from @entity30			2
the fighters were shooting more ordinance than usual into the air , and they flocked to our campsite behind the officer 's club , eager to chat , and even more eager to use our satellite telephones			1
one after another , they shyly asked if they could make a call			2
each one had a special reason for calling -- reassuring parents , a brother getting married , a sick baby daughter , an angry girlfriend			2
many talked about their expectations for the coming day			1
it would be a bloodbath			2
" maybe i 'll die tomorrow , i 'm ready for it , " declared @entity50 , a toothy young man from @entity7 who had spent several years in @entity51 , @entity52 , where he had picked up the local accent			1
" but if i do n't die , you are all welcome to stay at my house in @entity7			1
" @entity50 , like many of the fighters from @entity7 , insisted most of the people in his home town sided with the revolution			1
but there was concern about possible resistance from members of @entity19 's @entity67 tribe			1
despite a month of impressive advances by the @entity71 forces , it 's clear not everyone has gone over to the revolution			1
that afternoon we had gone into the nearby town of @entity76			2
i had seen scattered green flags flying over some of the houses earlier in the day			1
unlike other towns we had been through , few people in @entity82 waved or flashed the v - for - victory sign			2
they just glared at us			2
as @entity0 's @entity86 camerawoman @entity85 was taking pictures of the town , a car drove up to me in the town 's main roundabout			1
the driver , a young man in his early 20s , shouted to me : " @entity96 , @entity19 , @entity20 , wa bas " -- ( @entity93 , @entity19 and @entity20 only ) -- the standard slogan of @entity19 supporters , then began to pull away			1
" wait , " i told him			2
we 've been speaking to pro-revolutionaries ( @entity19 opponents ) , but not your type			1
" in the passenger seat sat a boy , maybe 10 - years old , who repeated the slogan several times , pumping his fists in the air			2
" no camera , " the driver told me			2
" everyone around here feels the same , but we 're afraid to say anything with all these thuwar ( revolutionaries ) around			1
" he then drove away			2
i crossed the street to a cigarette shop where there were about half a dozen people inside			2
the shopkeeper , a chunky man in his early 20s wearing a jalabiya , echoed the same sentiments			2
as did another man , who identified himself as @entity124 , a businessman			2
" if there were free elections here , and we had a choice between voting for @entity19 or the new regime in @entity30 , 90 % would vote for @entity19 , " he said			1
" and none of this would have happened if @entity133 was n't bombing @entity20			0
" a young fighter with an @entity135 walked into the shop to buy cigarettes			0
surprisingly , the discussion over the new @entity20 carried on			0
" we do n't want these guys here , " he said , pointing to the fighter			0
" they are going around , breaking into houses , stealing people 's possessions			1
that 's what they did to my cousin 's house			1
" " if that 's what happened , your cousin deserved it , " replied the fighter , who said he was from @entity30			1
by now a fairly large crowd had gathered to listen and take part in the conversation			0
suddenly a man pushed through the crowd and grabbed @entity124 by the shoulder			0
" get out of here and stop talking like that ! " he shouted , clearly angry , pushing @entity124 out of the shop			0
" are you an idiot ? " it was getting tense , so i stepped out of the shop			0
" do n't worry , " the shopkeeper told me			0
" it 's his brother			1
he just does n't want trouble			0
" as i stepped to the side of the road , anther car drove up , this time with three occupants wearing baseball caps emblazoned with the @entity183 @entity20 flag			0
when i peered into the car , i saw that the driver had a bottle of clear brown liquid in his lap. in the back seat a teenager with a machine gun in his lap was rolling a joint			0
" we are the revolutionaries of @entity82 , " the driver said , a big grin on his face			1
" what 's that ? " i asked him , pointing to the bottle			1
" @entity201 ! " he proudly declared			0
" you want some ? " i declined			0
i knew we had a big day ahead of us			1
although we had been told to be awake and ready to go at 4 a.m. , i woke up two hours later			1
having spent much of the last seven months in @entity20 , i knew these guys were not strong on punctuality			0
we ended up leaving the base around 10 a.m. behind the ambulances , and met the main body of fighters heading to @entity7			1
an hour later , after an uneventful drive though the desert , we arrived on the outskirts of @entity7			1
i could see some smoke on the horizon , but could hear no gunfire			0
small clumps of people by the side of the road were cheering and waving			0
driving further into the city , the crowds grew larger			1
there was gunfire but it was all in the air , the ubiquitous celebratory gunfire			0
up above , a man tore down the green flag from the city 's main water tower and sent it fluttering to the ground			1
we were the only journalists in @entity7			1
wherever we stopped cheering crowds mobbed us			0
most asked if we were with @entity235			0
the huge , bloody battle for @entity7 was n't to be			1
" we are now in @entity7 and we were not expecting this , " one of the doctors shouted			1
" this is the best moment of my life			0
" there was fighting , of course , in the @entity7 neighborhood of @entity247			1
we watched as cars and ambulances rushed to the emergency ward in the city 's main hospital			1
the medical team we had traveled with arrived at the hospital just minutes before the first casualties began to arrive			0
along with the wounded , came the dead , more than 10 in the two hours we were at the hospital			1
suddenly the bravado of the young fighters was gone when they drove up with the bodies of their dead comrades			1
they cried like children in one another 's arms			2
others just sat on the curb and wept quietly as their friends tried to console them			0
for many it was their first real encounter with combat			0
others vowed to carry on the fight and avenge their friends			0
by contrast , the loyalist dead were received without fanfare			0
a pickup drove up to the main entrance to the hospital with two bodies covered with a light blue cloth splayed in the back			0
on the side of the pickup truck the fighters were smug with satisfaction			2
" we killed the rats , " one told me , pointing his gun toward the bodies at his feet			0
that night we slept next to a @entity133 - bombed vip guesthouse at the airport , which had become the main base for the hundreds of @entity12 fighters who had taken part in the conquest of @entity7			1
the next morning we ventured out into the city			2
mid-morning , and there were few people out on the streets , and still plenty of green flags			0
in front of the administration building at @entity310 , a still intact portrait of @entity19 featuring the odd slogan , " high you are above every ceiling , proud you are above every height			1
" within minutes , a group of gunmen showed up , backing their pickup up to the poster , which they proceeded to rip apart with a knife			2
we then went to @entity322 , a tight neighborhood composed of families from all over @entity20			0
people look after their neighbors , keep an eye out for strangers , and never , as residents told us , dabbled in the dangerous business of politics			0
the streets are dusty , the asphalt crumbling			0
the roads in this corner of @entity7 were paved once , in the 1980s and never since , they told me			1
we sat down with the neighborhood men , each one cradling his machine gun			0
they explained that the last straw was when armed strangers -- they called mercenaries -- arrived on their street			0
" we shot one , he died right over there , " one of the men told me , pointing to the corner			0
he then showed me the video of the dying man he had shot on his cell phone			2
@entity355 said he had learned to use a gun in school			0
@entity19 " forced us to train on this , " he said , patting his @entity135 assault rifle			1
" he intended to change us to fighters to fight for his dreams in @entity362 and in other places			2
but @entity93 decided the reverse			0
he forced us to train on this thing to fight him			0
" afterwards , we went to the nearby home of @entity367 , a strong - willed @entity368 teacher at @entity310			0
i asked her why @entity7 , despite its reputation for being a @entity19 stronghold , had fallen to the opposition in less than 24 hours			1
people " realized that this man is not right			0
so many people came 180 degrees from being pro-gadhafi to protesting @entity19 , " she told me			1
" the other reason is that people got fed up -- lack of electricity , lack of water			0
so they wanted to get out of this situation			0
i am one of them			0
" there are still a few parts of @entity7 where the " thuwar , " the revolutionaries , are hesitant to tread			1
but most parts of @entity7 were like @entity322			1
they 'd simply had enough .			0

@entity0 's @entity393 met the @entity12 fighters heading to @entity7
in the hours before the attack fighters showed signs of nerves and *confidence*
the city , despite its reputation as a @entity19 stronghold , fell to the opposition in less than a day
there are still a few parts of @entity7 where the revolutionaries are hesitant to tread
