wings clipped , noses cut off , stripped down to the bone , these old birds will never fly again			0
but the giant hangar at the home of @entity6 is not a graveyard for planes -- it 's a recycling yard			1
@entity6 has been dismantling disused aircraft at its base in " @entity11 " -- a cluster of @entity14 flight engineering firms near the town of @entity16 in southern @entity14 -- since it was formed in 2009			1
although the company 's primary business remains aircraft storage , it has stripped 12 planes completely since its inception " we receive an old aircraft ... and completion of this work ( is ) when all the material can be reused , " says @entity22 , head of dismantling at the @entity14 aerospace company where planes go to die the parts salvaged during this process are repackaged and repurposed			1
landing gear and wing flaps are shipped out to be reinstalled in new planes while cockpits are reborn as flight simulators			2
all parts that are saved can be sold on by the aircraft owners			2
the remaining waste and scrap metal , meanwhile , is broken down for resale by @entity6			2
" the percentage of the aircraft to be recycled is around 87 % ( and ) actually we expect to rise that to 90 % " says @entity22			2
see also : in - flight phone calls to become standard with @entity6 's parent company , @entity50 , predicting that more than 9,000 aircraft will be retired or withdrawn from service over the next 20 years , there 's a clear need for aging planes to be disposed of in an environmentally friendly manner			1
by relieving retired models of their most valuable assets , @entity56 also believes it can transform airplane recycling into a lucrative business and one that makes sense for airlines looking to dispose of old models			1
the cost of storing a disused aircraft can be as much as € 20,000 ( $ 25,000 ) per month			1
this compares to a one - off cost of between € 100,000 and € 150,000 ( between $ 125,000 and $ 185,000 ) to tear down a plane , stripping it of items that can be reused or sold on at a profit			0
a conductor who loves the sound of fighter jets : these people really love to fly " all the materials we take out from each aircraft could be used in other industry , especially aeronautical industry , " says @entity22			2
while the efficiency savings this process brings are obvious , @entity56 also believes that dismantling old planes will allow engineers to better design more efficient aircraft in the future			1
understanding how parts erode , decay or develop over time will allow them to transfer that knowledge into new designs			0
" we are collecting in - service aircraft components to asses the remaining characteristics and capability in terms of stress and fatigue , " says @entity95 , project director of business development and change at @entity50			1
" it 's crucial in terms of experienced feedback in better designing the aircraft and providing to the designer some guidance -- how best we can assemble things together where things are fitting better			0
" as it stands , @entity6 's site in southern @entity14 can cater for 20 aircraft at a time , the company says			1
across the border in northern @entity119 , however , a new site is being prepared by one of the company 's subsidiaries			0
it will be able to store 200 planes at a time , and strip down between 30 and 40 models a year			0
according to @entity95 this expansion will enable @entity6 to prepare for the coming influx of retiring planes			1
it will also ensure aircraft are disposed of in a way that is efficient and makes the most of valuable materials			0
instead of " going from cradle to grave , " he says , airplanes will go from " cradle to cradle			0

@entity6 recycles disused aircraft at its plant in southern @entity14
@entity50 says around 9,000 planes will be retired or withdrawn from service over the next 20 years
@entity56 believes recycling old aircraft could save airlines *considerable* amounts of money
