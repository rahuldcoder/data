-- @entity2 's supreme court on tuesday explained its earlier ruling that @entity5 @entity4 be retried in the 2007 death of her roommate , saying the jury that acquitted her did n't consider all the evidence , and that discrepancies in testimony need to be answered			1
the high court also said evidence could support prosecutors ' initial argument -- that @entity18 was killed in a twisted sex misadventure game at @entity20 and @entity22 's home in @entity2 , the high court said , according to @entity2 news agency @entity23			1
the appeals court jury that acquitted @entity22 and her ex-boyfriend , @entity26 , in 2011 " neglected significant evidence " and theories , the high court said in a 74 - page explanation			1
@entity22 and @entity26 's retrial , which could start as soon as the fall , should examine discrepancies in testimony , the high court said			1
these include differing witness accounts of when screaming could be heard from the home , @entity23 reported			0
the high court overturned the acquittals in march , but withheld its full reasoning until tuesday			1

@entity22 may be ordered to return to @entity2 for the retrial			2
