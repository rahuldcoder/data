that happened in 2004 , when he was acting attorney general while @entity31 was hospitalized following emergency gall bladder surgery			2
government officials had told @entity0 that @entity4 had " vigorously opposed " aspects of the warrantless wiretapping program and refused to sign off on its continued use			1
@entity4 's opposition prompted then - @entity39 chief of staff @entity40 and then - @entity39 counsel @entity42 to visit @entity31 , the attorney general , in the hospital			1
@entity4 was in the room at the time , and he recalled later that " i thought i had just witnessed an effort to take advantage of a very sick man			0

" the administration 's efforts to criminally prosecute @entity88 for its part in the economic downturn have been abysmal , and ( the @entity7 ) would have to help build the case against some of his colleagues in this lucrative industry			1
" if nominated and approved by @entity95 , @entity4 will replace the man who will have led the @entity7 for the past 12 years -- officially starting the job days before the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks and later seeing the agency through terrorism and other high - profile cases			2
