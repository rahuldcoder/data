the primary season over and the nominating conventions complete , @entity4 and @entity5 hit the ground running friday for the final stretch of a campaign that began , for @entity4 at least , more than a year ago in @entity9			1
over the next 60 days of campaigning , much of it focusing on key battleground states , the two men will pitch their visions for the country to a divided electorate			2
they spent friday in two states that have long figured prominently in presidential elections , and which are considered up for grabs this year : @entity9 and @entity20			1
president @entity5 , fresh off his speech thursday night accepting the @entity23 presidential nomination , began his day with a rally in @entity25 , @entity20 , with vice president @entity26 and their wives			1
meanwhile , @entity29 challenger @entity4 addressed supporters in @entity31 , @entity9			1
five things we learned from @entity34 of the @entity35 later , the candidates swapped states -- with @entity5 and @entity26 traveling to @entity38 for an event at the @entity40 while @entity4 spoke to supporters in @entity41 , @entity20			1
while many of their speeches echoed remarks they 've made in recent weeks , including at their respective national conventions , one new and hot topic friday -- especially for @entity29 -- was a worse - than - expected jobs report issued by the @entity49			0
while unemployment fell to 8.1 % in august from 8.3 % the month before , the dip was largely the result of fewer people looking for work , an analysis of the data showed			0
the economy added 96,000 jobs in august , but that 's down from 141,000 the month before			0
economists polled by @entity61 had predicted 120,000 new jobs in august			0
speaking to reporters friday in @entity64 , @entity9 , @entity4 called the latest report " very disappointing , " stating that for " every net new job created , approximately four people dropped out of the workforce			1
" " after the party last night , the hangover today , " @entity4 said , referring to thursday 's @entity69			0
the former @entity73 governor also played up the jobs report at his public rallies friday , vowing to overturn @entity5 's signature health plan and institute a number of new policies that he says will energize the economy			1
" this economy is going to come back in a big way ... but it is going to require me being elected president , " @entity4 said in @entity41 , eliciting a roar from the supportive crowd			1
@entity5 fired back in his @entity25 appearance , stressing the positive news that businesses had created jobs for the 30th straight month			2
but he ackowledged the pace was insufficient			0
" we know it 's not good enough			0
we need to create more jobs , faster , " the president said			0
and as he did during his speech thursday night in @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity5 specified several economic - related pledges and said it could take years for the economy to be back at full steam			2
but any progress thus far will be for naught , and everyday @entity103 will be sold out , if @entity4 wins the election , he said			2
@entity106 report brings end to @entity23 ' convention high " if you turn away now -- if you buy into the cynicism that the change we fought for is n't possible -- well , change will not happen , " he said in his speech			0
he said voters will have " a choice between two different paths for @entity103 , a choice between two fundamentally different visions for the future			0
" in response , @entity4 said @entity5 was offering more of the same policies he said have led to high unemployment , rising deficits and a slow economic recovery			1
" @entity103 will hold president @entity5 accountable for his record -- they know they 're not better off and that it 's time to change direction , " the @entity4 campaign said in a statement			1
in @entity9 , he reiterated the charge , and said @entity5 's acceptance speech highlighted his opponent 's shortcomings			1
" there was nothing in the speech that gives confidence that the president knows what he is doing when it comes to jobs and the economy , " @entity4 said			1
in the latest @entity0 / @entity144 poll -- conducted before the @entity23 convention -- @entity5 and @entity4 were tied			2
in the poll of 1,005 likely voters , 48 % said they would support @entity4 and an identical number backed @entity5			2
about 2 % said they favored neither candidate , and 1 % had no opinion			0
breaking down @entity5 's speech @entity0 's @entity153 and @entity154 and @entity61 's @entity155 contributed to this report .			0
