-- this is a story about a girl and her tree -- a tree that helped keep hope alive , even as the world closed in on her			1
three times in @entity11 's widely read diary , the young @entity8 victim wrote about a tree			1
she could see it from the attic window of the secret annex where her family hid for two years , before being betrayed			1
" from my favorite spot on the floor i look up at the blue sky and the bare chestnut tree , on whose branches little raindrops shine , appearing like silver , and at the seagulls and other birds as they glide on the wind , " she wrote on february 23 , 1944			1
" as long as this exists , and it certainly always will , i know that then there will always be comfort for every sorrow , whatever the circumstances may be			0
" the tree that reminded @entity37 of the promise of life still looms high above the courtyard behind the @entity41 , now a museum in @entity43 , @entity44 , that just marked its 50th anniversary			1
but at about 170 years of age , @entity11 's tree is dying			1
the spring before her family and the others hiding with them were captured , the girl focused on the tree 's budding life -- and her own			1
" our chestnut tree is already quite greenish and you can even see little blooms here and there , " she wrote on april 18 , 1944			1
two days earlier , she 'd recorded her first kiss			0
@entity37 died of typhus in @entity60 just weeks before the @entity62 concentration camp was liberated in 1945			0
but her name , story and message live on through her diary and , also , through her ailing tree			1
the tree that keeps giving the tree has been sick for 10 years ; a fungus has left two - thirds of it hollow , said @entity41 spokeswoman @entity72			1
a battle began in late 2007 between city officials who wanted to chop it down and activists who insisted it stay			0
but a court injunction , a second - opinion analysis and a committee mobilization later , it still stands , barely alive and supported by steel			0
about five years ago , the museum began collecting chestnuts from the tree to grow seedlings , so that pieces of the original tree could take root and flourish elsewhere			1
the tree is a horse chestnut , which is often called a buckeye tree in the @entity93 and a conker tree in the @entity95			1
its saplings have been distributed to international parks and schools named for @entity11			1
one will be planted later this year at @entity101 , @entity103 's official @entity8 memorial in @entity104			2
through a project and contest launched last year by the @entity108 , a @entity109 - based educational nonprofit working with the museum in @entity43 , 11 sites in the @entity93 will see @entity37 's tree blossom			1
they range from the @entity113 and various museums and memorials to a high school that changed @entity93 history			2
a handful of winning applications were driven by youth inspired by @entity37 , who would be 80 if she 'd survived , and her diary			2
one girl in @entity123 , @entity124 , 12 - year - old @entity122 , felt an immediate connection to the writer , so much so that she chose to have her bat mitzvah -- the coming of age ceremony for @entity130 girls -- in the synagogue @entity131 attended in @entity43 before they went into hiding			2
" it was n't just a diary written by some person , it was written by a 13 - year - old girl , " @entity122 said			0
" i was interested in the story of her life			0
she had so much hope			0
there are some parts [ of the diary ] that are really sad , but it 's more inspiring			2
" with the help of her family , and contacts they have with local officials , @entity122 's inspired push will bring a tree to @entity157 and lessons about tolerance to the city 's public schools			2
down @entity162 , a public school in @entity164 , the only in the nation to become a national historic site , will also see an @entity11 tree bloom			1
@entity169 senior @entity168 , 17 , heard about the contest last summer while listening to @entity171			0
his school was racially integrated in 1957 by the " @entity173 , " a development that proved a pivotal moment in the @entity176			0
an avid follower of history and politics , @entity168 saw parallels between @entity11 's legacy and that of the @entity164 students			1
" from all across the world , in different time periods and different social struggles , young people have been caught up in history and these social tensions have come down upon them , " @entity168 said			0
" @entity11 was 14 when she was hiding , and the youngest of the nine was 14			1
" for @entity193 , it was in many ways her father 's youth , and by extension her own , that made her reach out for a part of the tree			2
the dean of social sciences at @entity203 in @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity193 is the daughter of a @entity8 survivor			0
her father lost his mother , sister and brother when they were taken to a pit outside their @entity214 village and gunned down with about 2,000 other @entity130			0
" the shades were always drawn in my house			0
we were afraid of neighbors , " she said , describing the legacy she carried			0
" i became a genocide scholar over the years because of my personal story			0
" the sapling she competed for will be nurtured in the university 's @entity226 , where genocides across time are remembered			0
beside it will be a sign quoting @entity37 : " how wonderful it is that nobody need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world			0
" much of what his daughter wrote came as a surprise to @entity37 , the family 's sole survivor			2
he retrieved the diary and eventually published it after @entity241 more than 30 million copies have been sold			0
in a speech he gave in 1968 , according to the @entity41 , he spoke of the reactions he had upon first reading his daughter 's words			2
" how could i have suspected that it meant so much to @entity11 to see a patch of blue sky , to observe the gulls during their flight and how important the chestnut tree was to her , as i recall that she never took an interest in nature , " he said			1
" but she longed for it during that time when she felt like a caged bird			0
" it turns out the saplings selected for sites in the @entity93 are caged themselves			1
when they arrived in the country in december , the young trees were seized by the @entity93 @entity263			2
because of sicknesses ravaging horse chestnuts in @entity266 , the trees will remain in quarantine for three years			1
the tree @entity37 secretly admired through an attic window will be gone in five to 15 years , @entity41 officials say			2
but by the time it disappears , pieces of it will be growing strong , reaching for blue skies and welcoming birds across the globe -- a living legacy to a girl who understood what life could promise .			0

while in hiding , *holocaust* victim @entity11 wrote in her diary about a tree
the tree gave her hope about life , but now it is dying outside the secret annex
the tree 's meaning will live on through distributed saplings grown from its chestnuts
eleven sites in @entity93 win saplings but will have to wait three years *due* to quarantine
