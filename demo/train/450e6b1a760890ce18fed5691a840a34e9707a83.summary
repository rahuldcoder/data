measles this year has hit the most disparate places : camps for internally displaced people in northeast @entity4 , who 've had to flee from @entity6 , and @entity7 in @entity8			2
the differences of the two settings are stark			0
in one , people are fighting for survival and have difficulty getting health care ; the other is a first - world amusement park where people can afford medical choices regarding a vaccine - preventable disease			0
the @entity21 is grappling with the resurgence of a disease it eliminated 15 years ago			1
but it 's not alone			0
data by the @entity27 indicate that measles immunization rates are declining in several @entity30 countries , like @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 , as some parents are opting out due to personal beliefs			1
the data also show that more than 100 countries , including @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 , have higher measles immunization rates than the @entity21 , which was at 91 %			1
dr. @entity44 , senior health adviser of immunization at @entity46 , spent years promoting polio and measles vaccines in @entity49			1
" generally , in the developing world , people welcome the vaccines , " he said			0
" the vaccine hesitancy , concern among the elite ... this is not a major issue in immunization against measles , because people have seen devastation from the outbreaks			1
" globally , measles deaths hit record lows in 2012 , which the @entity27 attributed to successful immunization campaigns as annual deaths declined to 122,000 from 562,000 in 2002			1
but the @entity27 warned that progress was fragile , because outbreaks still occur and measles remains one of the leading killers of children in the world			2
a joint global plan involving @entity46 , the @entity27 , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 aims to eliminate measles by 2020			2
" in the last two to three years , we 've seen more stagnation of progress because there is complacency , " said @entity44			0
countries with the highest measles incidence per 100,000 population 1			1
@entity92 -- 41.9 countries with the most suspected measles cases 1			1
@entity90 -- 12,300 source : who , does not include data from all countries @entity102 has the most suspected case of measles , with @entity95 at top , followed by the @entity91 and @entity96 , according to 2014 data from the @entity27			1
but the rate , rather than raw numbers , offers a more accurate measure of the disease			0
one of the countries worst hit by the measles is the @entity91 , which was struck by @entity113 in november 2013			1
the spread of the virus has been exacerbated by mass migration , with nearly 4 million people displaced by the devastating storm			0
but what happens in the @entity91 has a direct connection to the @entity21 , because the virus can easily travel -- as was the case of the unvaccinated @entity124 missionaries who brought back measles from the @entity91 to cause an @entity127 outbreak that infected 383 people in 2014			1
the @entity76 reported that 25 @entity21 travelers , most of them unvaccinated , got ill with the measles after returning from the @entity91 last year			1
@entity95 , which had the most measles cases in 2014 , is also going through multiple outbreaks			1
measles has been reported in a university in @entity137 province and a downtown @entity139 office , resulting in quarantines and vaccinations for thousands of people , according to @entity143 , the @entity95 state - run news agency			2
the @entity145 reported three toddler deaths and more than 2,700 measles cases in january -- double the rate seen in the same month two years ago			1
" @entity152 outbreak occurs every four to five years , and now it 's on an uprising stage based on its pattern , " said @entity149 , deputy director of the local @entity139 disease control agency			0
officials from the national health agency told state - run @entity158 that many of the cases are occurring in adults who never received their vaccines			2
vaccine campaigns were not strong in the 1970s and 1980s , so some missed their shots			0
as many as two - thirds of the @entity139 cases are among people over the age of 20			2
" this outbreak reveals to us the fact that some unvaccinated people have become older , and it 's like an accumulated debt from the past , " @entity170 , an official with the @entity95 @entity76 , told @entity158			0
measles outbreaks have also been reported in @entity178 and @entity4			0
in mid-january , the @entity179 of @entity4 reported a measles outbreak in the state of @entity182 in the country 's northeast at camps for internally displaced people			0
the state is frequently under attack by @entity6 militants			0
an official told the media that the outbreak stemmed from a daily mass movement of people			0
@entity46 has to deal with logistical , infrastructure and transport challenges to get vaccines to some of the most remote and insecure areas in the world , said @entity44			0
regarding the current outbreak in the @entity21 , he said : " it perplexes me , to see a country with no logistical challenges , readily available resources , with refuted studies and the anti-vaccine lobbies , you still see transmission continuing			1
it 's not easy for me to grasp			0
" the @entity21 is not the only developed country going through vaccine skepticism			2
in @entity31 last year , a group that does n't get vaccines carried the infection back after visiting the @entity216			0
local health authorities in @entity219 @entity218 confirmed 375 cases , which was declared the worst measles outbreak in 30 years in @entity31			2
the @entity216 also saw a major measles outbreak from may 2013 to march 2014 , where more than 2,600 people contracted the disease in communities that do not typically vaccinate			2
@entity227 reported 4,735 measles cases in 2014 , in which 85 % of the cases were unvaccinated and 10 % had not finished their doses			1
the continent saw a peak in 2010 , with 32,480 measles cases			1
@entity0 's @entity236 and @entity139 intern @entity237 contributed to this report .			0

immunization rates are declining in parts of @entity30 countries
many @entity21 measles cases in 2014 are linked to travelers to the @entity91
the @entity91 , which is coping with measles after @entity113 , had over *50,000* cases in 2014
