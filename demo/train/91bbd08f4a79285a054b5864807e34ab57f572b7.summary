-- what would you have done ? last month in @entity4 , a school bus driver witnessed a vicious assault on a 13 - year - old boy			1
he radioed the bus dispatcher and frantically begged for assistance , as he feared the victim was being seriously injured			1
but he did not intervene			2
while the victim 's physical injuries may heal , his psychological trauma will undoubtedly linger , including the harrowing knowledge that no one would help him			2
teens trained to spot drama before it turns dangerous but before we pile on the driver , let 's be clear : the most egregious wrongdoers here are the violent teens			1
they victimized a boy horribly and wronged the agonized bystanders			2
the driver 's anguish over his own inaction may be real and palpable , but should he still have done more ? obviously , he was n't confident enough of his own physical ability to handle several violent teenagers , although he had a special responsibility to protect the children on that bus			1
we all want to think that we would disregard our own personal safety to help children , but in a highly charged moment , a bystander is forced to make an instant , possibly haunting judgment about risk and danger			2
violence works both by crushing a victim and by intimidating others			2
when you 're not there , it 's easy to dismiss the terror , but for the bystander , it 's often a lose - lose proposition			0
fail to intervene , and it haunts you ; intervene , and you may become the victim			0
intervention requires bystanders to overcome the basic self - protective instinct that ensures their own survival , and that 's probably why there 's no one we admire more than those who disregard their own personal safety to help others			0
teachers ' lesson in heroism and healing despite that admiration , and despite our sense as adults that we need to protect children , many of us find that we do not , and can not , intervene as bystanders			0
to complicate matters , some violent situations can actually be worsened when a bystander intervenes			0
my own research ( @entity80 ) at the @entity81 at @entity82 , and similar studies ( @entity80 ) at the @entity84 at @entity85 , have found that bystander interventions in bullying episodes frequently backfire			1
the bully , feeling publicly humiliated , takes revenge against the original victim			0
knowing that you might worsen the victim 's situation only makes these incidents more frustrating			0
if an adult should n't throw himself in the middle of a physical altercation , what else can he do ? in the @entity4 situation , there was an immediate danger that required a response but not necessarily significant physical risk			1
a recent study in the journal @entity107 found that interveners typically used nonviolent methods			0
if the school bus company had developed a set of emergency procedures that did n't require high personal jeopardy , perhaps the entire crisis could have been avoided			1
bus drivers can be trained in the use of tools and techniques that can help disable violent teens ( e.g. , use of pepper spray )			1
calls to dispatch can be augmented with 911 calls and emergency " panic " buttons			0
no one likes to consider that such preparations are necessary , and they will cost money , but by thinking ahead and preparing for such scenarios , we might be able to avoid a situation where the choice is simply who will end up with the broken bones			0
interrupting the cycle of teen violence the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity141 .			1

@entity4 school bus driver did not help when teen was beaten on bus
@entity141 says before *criticizing* , place blame on **assailants** ; driver in terrible spot
studies show intervening can backfire ; *people* need alternative to assuming risk , she says
*englander* : bus companies should have tools , techniques to disable **assailants** till help arrives
