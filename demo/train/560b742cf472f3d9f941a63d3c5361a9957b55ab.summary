-- break out your @entity1 and your " @entity3 " collection ! it 's " @entity10 , " and @entity6 embraced geeks by letting them ring the starting bell at the @entity9 on tuesday morning			1
those bellringers are also known as members of @entity14 's @entity13 , who drive to the rescue of people trying to master the computers they bought from the store			1
this embracing holiday is just one of a handful of geeky observances : " @entity25 , " " @entity26 , " " @entity27 " ( think " @entity23 " ) , " @entity24			0
" there 's even a " take your @entity29 to @entity31			0
" but this particular day -- " @entity10 " -- is copyrighted by @entity32 , and meant for people who are " into dungeon games , comic books and doing vampire dress - up , " as well as those who " spend endless hours going strange places on the internet			1
" according to @entity32 , " this is your day to roar ! " so why do @entity41 celebrate people who are defined by @entity44 's dictionary as , " any person considered to be different from others in a negative or bizarre way , as a teenager seen as being socially or physically awkward " ? according to @entity49 , author of " @entity50 : the story of my people , " a geek is " a nerd who is defined by his knowledge on a certain subject			2
" ( @entity49 points out that this is a far cry from what the word " geek " used to mean -- a carnie who was so unskilled that all he or she could do was bite the heads off live animals			1
) thanks to @entity69 and the charismatic representation of geekdom by people like @entity74 's @entity73 and @entity75 and @entity77 's @entity76 , geeks are fashionable and associated with economic power , @entity49 said			2
even their interests , like video games and computer technology , " have become so refined that they 're irresistible to a huge percentage of the population , " said @entity49			1
@entity85 , a cultural anthropologist with @entity86 , agrees			0
" there are far more products , programs , services and applications than there 's ever been before , " she said			2
" and they speak to a wider market than ever before			2
" since geeks are strongly inclined to master technology , said @entity85 , they now represent dominance over a domain the general and less geeky members of the public would like to conquer			1
geek holidays , while probably not necessary for true geeks to accept their quirks and interests , give others ample opportunity to celebrate and nurture their inner geek			1
along with the mainstreaming of geek interests comes a bittersweet trade - off for geeks who had been marginalized in the past			1
@entity49 said that when geeks and nerds were not as readily accepted in @entity41 culture , they had a thriving , fraternal community spirit			1
now that technology , sci - fi , comics and gaming are mass consumer experiences , @entity49 said , geek communities are fracturing			1
but in 2010 , letting your geek flag fly has become a source of pride for many @entity41			2
@entity85 said it 's a natural fit for a country that 's known as a nation of individuals			0
@entity133 , ceo of @entity134 , the company that runs popular sites @entity136 , @entity138 and @entity139 , said that geeks will define the 2010s much as the @entity141 defined the 1990s			2
read @entity143 's interview : hey , @entity145 , what 's the geekiest thing you 've ever done ? @entity133 likens geek obsession to the fan in everyone			0
" people are getting in touch with their inner geekdom and that can take the form of many different kinds of passions or obsessions			0
it used to be a ' sports fan ' or a ' sports nut , ' now it 's a geek , " he said			0
geek mainstreaming began decades ago , said @entity49 , when " @entity165 " and the " @entity166 " books burst on the scene to unprecedented popularity			0
science fiction and fantasy , once the bastions of geek and nerd culture , became huge entertainment moneymakers thereafter , he said			1
" more recently , our pop culture has become generous towards nerdy characters , " said @entity49			1
through tv shows like " @entity180 " and @entity182 's movies , geeks have become protagonists -- leading men , even -- and not just comic relief , he said			1
@entity85 goes so far as to say being geeky is downright @entity41			0
" think about the railways or the electrification of @entity41 or the moon shot , even the @entity189 , " she said			0
" there 's always a strong sense that to have technical prowess is a quintessential piece of what it is to be @entity41 ... and what it means to be successfully @entity41			0
" the mainstreaming of geek interests naturally leads to another @entity41 pursuit : capitalism			1
@entity32 does , after all , make money on its copyrights			0
in the last year , @entity134 , a company that harnesses the natural talents of geeks and caters to their interests , saw an explosion of sales			2
@entity134 offers geeks a one - stop shop : geek - written content , free open source code and all the niche tchotchkes a geek could want			2
companies appealing to a broader audience are ready to use images of geeks in order to see that same kind of success			0
@entity74 's @entity223 and @entity224 commercials showcase two geeks -- old school and new -- while @entity86 's " rock star " commercials show off how geeky the company is ( because their rock stars are inventors			2
) " communications technology , especially , has such a patina , " said @entity85 , " and geek culture puts a face on all this technology			1
" geeks evoke the ideas of diversity and innovation , she said , and it 's valuable for companies to commodify that			0
" i think what those companies are exploiting is a desire for the reassurance of technical expertise , " he said			0
" this sort of cuddly nerd character who fixes your computer and makes everything right is reassuring , " said @entity49			0
" this is n't an intimidating expert who will say things you do n't understand and condescend to you			0
" @entity14 's @entity13 , for example , uses the image of geeks to appeal to a large audience			1
@entity133 said this kind of marketing says to customers , " if you 're not a geek and you want what geeks have , because geeks are cool and have cutting edge -- bleeding edge -- technology , we can bring that to you			1
" @entity273 , a member of the bell - ringing @entity13 team , thinks @entity14 has plenty of geek			1
" we are a group of people ... that take the passion we have for technology and help other people embrace it , so they can have passion about it as well , " he said			0
ironically , geeks need little marketing and even less convincing			2
" i think what 's interesting about geek culture is that it does n't need to be marketed to , much , " said @entity49			1
" if you have a new product , they will embrace it on its own merit , because they 're geeks			0
they read the trade magazines , and they read articles in @entity300 and they obsess about these things in chat rooms			0

the @entity13 rang the @entity9 bell tuesday for " @entity10 "
pop culture and *ubiquitous* technology make geek culture mainstream
businesses use geeks and geek interests to market to *non-geeks*
new products aimed at geeks need little marketing -- geeks already want them
