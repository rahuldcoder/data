-- the sun may be setting on @entity4 's @entity3 career , but the veteran @entity6 driver lit up @entity7 on saturday by snatching pole position from all - conquering @entity10 teammate @entity9			1
@entity4 has been outshined by the @entity11 for most of this season , but he has given himself a chance of ending the four - time world champion 's run of six consecutive victories in sunday 's race			1
that would be sweet for the 37 - year - old , who will drive in endurance racing for @entity22 next season after a frustrating time in @entity9 's shadow			1
as light segued to dark in qualifying for @entity3 's only day / night event , @entity4 posted the fastest time of 1:39:957 at @entity28 for his second pole this season -- the other was two races ago in @entity32 , where he finished second to @entity9			1
he now has three races in which to add to his nine career wins			0
" it 's not the easiest venue , because of the changing temperatures , " @entity4 , who is fifth in the overall standings , told reporters			1
" we run in the afternoon and then at night , so you have to be on top of the changing conditions as a driver and also from an engineering perspective			0
interactive : explore ' @entity47 's @entity3 circuit " it was n't the most electric start to @entity50 or @entity51 , but we made changes to the car as the session went on and i got more comfortable			0
i knew i had to work on certain sections of the track which @entity9 had already been doing a good job on , so i had to try and match him as well as continuing to keep the areas where i was doing a good job too , so overall i 'm happy with the pole			1
" we 're really looking forward to the race tomorrow			0
" @entity9 , who last weekend became only the third driver in @entity3 history to win four successive championships , appeared happy to share the limelight with a man who he denied victory in @entity70 after ignoring team orders			1
" it was a great result for the team			0
at the start of qualifying i think @entity75 looked very strong ; @entity4 and myself were n't hanging about , but they were very quick , " the 26 - year - old said			1
" in @entity78 we seemed to be able to find a little bit of extra time			1
@entity4 did a very good lap , so congratulations to him			2
i should have done a little bit better , but i do n't know if it would have been enough , @entity4 deserves to be on pole today ; it was a good lap with no mistakes			2
" second - placed @entity75 ' bid to stay ahead of @entity88 in the constructors ' standings was boosted when @entity91 and @entity92 locked up the second row of the grid , despite the latter suffering mechanical problems			1
" fourth place feels pretty good this evening considering the time was set on my first @entity78 lap , " said 2008 world champion @entity92			1
" unfortunately on my second lap it looks like something gave way at the back of the car as i got on the power at the chicane and it just snapped out , which forced me into a spin			0
" it was a great lap and might just have been enough to get us onto the front row as i was fourth - tenths up on my first effort , but these things happen			0
" the car felt really strong today so we 'll hope for a good start and then challenge to make up some positions in the race tomorrow			0
the good thing is that we are ahead of @entity88 and that 's where we need to stay			2
" @entity88 's focus , despite all statements to the contrary , seems to be on next season already , with @entity125 -- second in the championship -- failing to make @entity78 for the first time this year			1
the @entity128 qualified 11th , though he will have a choice of tires , while teammate @entity131 was eighth after sneaking into @entity78 in 10th			2
@entity132 , who will replace the @entity133 at @entity88 next year , shrugged off his pay dispute with @entity135 by claiming fifth place in qualifying , while teammate @entity138 -- seeking a fourth consecutive podium finish -- was seventh			1
however , @entity132 was later excluded after his car failed a technical test , meaning the @entity142 will start at the back of the grid and every other driver who qualified below him will be bumped up one place			0
it was a similar problem with the floor of the vehicle that affected @entity138 in @entity151 , but this time fourth - placed @entity135 ' explanation was not accepted by the race stewards			2
@entity125 remained upbeat about sunday 's race , despite his lowly position			1
" the problem that we are facing is that we are not very competitive , " the 2005 - 06 world champion said			0
" but we were n't competitive in july , we were not competitive in august or in september , but we still have five podiums and three consecutive second places			0
" so this masks a little bit the problems we were having			0
now we are back to reality but it will not stop us fighting			0
we will score more than the others , i have no doubt			0
" @entity169 's @entity168 , a contender to join @entity135 , was sixth in qualifying to continue his impressive run while @entity172 's @entity171 was ninth			2
@entity173 , who will replace his compatriot @entity4 next season , rounded out the top 10 for @entity176			2
@entity172 's 2009 world champion @entity177 was 13th .			0
