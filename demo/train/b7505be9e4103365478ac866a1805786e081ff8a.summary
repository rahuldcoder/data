-- @entity1 and @entity2 need to reach agreement on how they will manage water from one of the world 's great rivers -- the @entity9 -- before it becomes another serious impediment to relations between the two @entity13 heavyweights			1
water scarcity already affects large parts of @entity1 and @entity2			1
as their populations grow and income levels rise , forcing up demand for water - intensive food such as meat , the supply situation will worsen			1
inevitably , that means tension over water resources			2
there is a regional precedent for a bilateral water treaty : bitter rivals @entity2 and @entity30 , under prodding from the @entity31 , signed the @entity32 in 1960 to cover water use from the @entity32 and five other rivers that flow through the two nations			1
while far from perfect , the treaty has given farmers and other users in both countries a framework on which they can make crop production and hydropower decisions			0
infographic : the secret life of drinking water already , @entity1 's construction of a 540 - megawatt hydropower dam on the @entity9 , which flows for 1,700 kilometers ( 1,050 miles ) across the southern @entity49 plateau before it enters @entity50 and becomes the @entity51 , is cause for concern in @entity54			1
the dam , known as the @entity56 , is due for completion in 2015			0
while the @entity56 dam is a relatively small project , there is something much bigger on the horizon : a 38,000 - megawatt dam at @entity63 , near the river 's " @entity64 , " which potentially could reduce the volume of water flowing into @entity2 and @entity68			1
while @entity1 maintains that any dams it builds on its part of the river will have little downstream impact , up to 150 million people living in eastern @entity2 and @entity68 could be affected			1
almost half the world 's population -- the 3.5 billion people living in @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 -- relies on water from the great rivers that rise in the @entity81 , the @entity49 plateau , and the @entity49 ethnic areas of @entity1			1
the way the most important of these rivers -- the @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity51 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 -- are used carries the potential for conflict as countries struggle with the challenges of rising populations , pressure on farming and food supplies , diminishing water quality and demand for hydropower			2
@entity1 has always been prepared to move mountains and people to achieve its economic and social goals			2
the $ 25 billion @entity106 , built in the upper reaches of the @entity89 between 1994 - 2011 , is testament to that			2
as many as 1.3 million people were relocated so the dam could be built , both to generate power and as a flood mitigation measure			0
its full ecological impact is yet to be determined			0
now @entity1 is working on its massive $ 60 billion @entity116 that involves the country 's two most important rivers -- the @entity89 and the @entity90 -- plus numerous tributaries , canals and other rivers such as the @entity122 and @entity123			2
it is one of the biggest civil engineering projects conceived anywhere in the world			0
first formulated by chairman @entity130 in 1952 as a way to move water from the southern half of @entity1 to the dry but heavily populated north , the three - part scheme took its first steps forward in 2002 when work began on the 1,155 kilometer ( 716 mile ) eastern route			1
this part of the project , scheduled for completion in 2013 , will take water from the @entity89 via channels to @entity143 province , and then by a tunnel under the @entity145 and onwards to the coastal city of @entity147			0
work on the central route began late in 2003			0
this 1,267 kilometer ( 785 mile ) diversion is designed to take water from a reservoir on the @entity152 ( a tributary of the @entity89 ) along new canals on to @entity155 and @entity156 provinces , and finally to @entity158			0
a trunk line will also serve @entity147			0
long - term , the western route is the one which causes the most concern , as it involves diverting water from tributaries of the @entity89 , including the @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity167 rivers , across the @entity168 to the @entity145 , to supply northwest @entity1			1
while some experts doubt the western diversion will ever be built because of the massive cost and logistical challenges of tunnelling under a mountain range , @entity1 's record in building mega-projects suggests otherwise			2
in march this year , vice-premier ( and likely premier in 2013 ) @entity177 told a @entity180 meeting that drought and water shortages in the north had held back economic development there			0
as a consequence , he said , the @entity116 diversion project was " essential			0
" in june , @entity1 announced it had begun work on a key part of the central route : a $ 1.4 billion , 45 kilometer tunnel to divert water from the @entity89 to @entity158			1
the tunnel should be finished by 2014			0
@entity1 has always moved faster than @entity2 ; that 's why the time for a water treaty is now			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity198 .			0

@entity1 , @entity2 need to agree on water management of @entity9 - @entity202 river
precedent for this when @entity2 and @entity30 signed @entity32 in 1960
@entity1 construction of @entity208 already causing concern for @entity54
