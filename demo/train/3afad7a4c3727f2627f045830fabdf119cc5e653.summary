@entity0 would be willing to put its troops on the ground in @entity4 " if others dos their part , " @entity0 prime minister @entity5 told @entity1 's @entity6 in an interview that aired monday			1
" we are ready to do everything if there is a clear strategy that after @entity14 , we can be sure that our border will be protected			1
we do n't want the regime anymore on our border pushing people against -- towards @entity0			2
we do n't want other terrorist organizations to be active there			2
" " we want this humanitarian policy on the other side of the border			2
second : military strategy , security			2
if there is there any threat against our national security , we will take all the measures -- all the measures			2
" @entity0 , @entity4 's northern neighbor , has been central to the civil war there since it began over three years ago			1
then - prime minister @entity33 broke with his longtime ally , @entity35 president @entity34 , to support @entity4 's opposition			1
ever since , the government has been trying to convince the international community to do more to stop @entity34			2
@entity40 president @entity39 , long wary of becoming involved , has become convinced that he must intervene in the @entity35 war , but only to stop @entity14 , not to go after the leader he nonetheless says long ago lost the legitimacy to govern			1
' our approach should be comprehensive ' " we should n't be separating pre-isis and @entity4 , " @entity5 told @entity6			1
" from the first early days of the crisis until now , no other country did more than @entity0 ; what @entity0 did against the attacks , brutal attacks of the regime , as well as against @entity14			1
" he said that @entity40 airstrikes in @entity4 were necessary but not enough for a victory			1
" if @entity14 goes , another radical organization may come in , " he said			1
" so our approach should be comprehensive , inclusive , strategic and combined ... not just to punish -- to satisfy our public opinion -- to punish one terrorist organization , but to eliminate all terrorist threats in the future , and also to eliminate all brutal crimes against humanity committed by the regime			1
" " we want to have a no - fly zone			2
we want to have a safe haven on our border			2
otherwise , all these burdens will continue to go on the shoulder of @entity0 and other neighboring countries			2
" right now on @entity0 's border , @entity14 has been vying for control of the @entity35 town of @entity72 ; @entity1 crews on the border witnessed what appeared to be an @entity14 black flag flying on the eastern side of town			1
" we will do everything possible to help people of @entity72 because they are our brothers and sisters			1
we do n't see them as @entity82 or @entity83 or @entity84			2
if there is a need of intervention to @entity72 , we are telling that there is a need of intervention to all @entity4 , all of our border			1
" the rise of @entity14 , and the international military strikes against it , have forced hundreds of thousands of refugees across @entity0 's border in recent weeks , to join the nearly 1 million refugees that the @entity98 refugee agency says are already there			1
" people are asking us to receive refugees , and they are praising us , ok			0
but at the same time , they are saying please control your border			0
how can you control a border if , in three days , 180,000 people are coming ? in three days ! " on the front lines of @entity4 's war , @entity0 is trying to dispel the idea that the @entity40 can become involved in @entity4 by going after @entity14 but not @entity34			1
" we said chemical weapons are the red line			0
what happened to him ? " " we did n't do anything			0
" " he killed people by punishing through hunger			0
he surrounded cities , neighborhoods , and kept them hungry			0
and we have seen -- you showed in your program -- 50,000 photographs who were killed by these methods , by @entity35 regime			0
" " and now , because of these crimes , there was no reaction , these radical organizations -- i mean @entity14 -- misused this atmosphere and told these people the international community does n't defend you			1
only i can defend you by my own means			0
this was the source of @entity14			1
" @entity5 said @entity0 warned the @entity140 " several times " about the rise of radicalism in @entity4			1
" we talked to our @entity146 and @entity40 colleagues that if there is no solution against these crimes against humanity by the @entity35 regime , there will be a rise of radicalism			1
at that time , there was no name of @entity14 , but we were telling them			1
" a porous border , a diplomatic spat disagreements over how much @entity40 should involve itself in the @entity4 civil war are not the only source of tension between @entity0 and the @entity40			1
last week , @entity40 vice president @entity164 blamed @entity0 in part for the rise of groups like @entity14			1
" they poured hundreds of millions of dollars and thousands of tons of weapons into anyone who would fight against @entity34 , " he said			0
" except that the people who were being supplied were @entity173 and @entity174 and the extremist elements of jihadis coming from other parts of the world			0
" the vice president apologized to @entity33 in a phone conversation this weekend			0
" this is really a very unfair accusation , " @entity5 said			1
" what we expect , @entity6 , are two things : fairness and empathy			0
" " @entity40 , the @entity40 , has a border with @entity188 , and there are two states on both sides			1
is it easy to control all the border ? " " one point six million people came ( to @entity0 )			0
this is the combined total , combined population of @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity200			0
" " you can imagine which type of risks and challenges we are facing			0
either we will close the borders , which means nobody can come in , which would be against our culture			0
" @entity0 has nonetheless openly supported the moderate opposition			0
" we did n't hide that we are supporting the moderate opposition , @entity211 , by all means			0
if others listened to our advice -- our allies and the permanent members of the @entity217 -- if they had protected and supported the moderate opposition , today we would n't be facing such a big crisis of @entity14			1
" @entity0 in transition @entity5 has been prime minister for a little over a month , having previously been foreign minister			1
the change comes as @entity33 has transitioned to the office of president , having won a landmark election -- the first time @entity0 directly elected their president			0
though the role of president is officially ceremonial , @entity33 has talked openly about changing the constitution , and many critics say he has become increasingly authoritarian in his governing style			0
" i made some important changes " in the @entity233 , @entity5 said			1
" that was my own choice			0
i do n't want to make big changes because there will be a new -- another election in 2015			0
" " i also told and i promised my people that there is a need for a new constitution because this constitution is a product of a military coup d'etat			0
but the main change of constitution is -- will be directed to human rights and not state - centric constitution			0
" on the eve of @entity5 's ascension to prime minister , a prominent @entity0 writer said in the @entity254 that he could have a calming effect on the country 's politics			2
" although mr. @entity33 chose him because they seem to agree on all major issues , mr. @entity5 could still help @entity0 by bringing his gentle , polite and smiling persona to the country 's bitter and hate - filled political scene , " @entity258 wrote			2
" first of all , the assumption is wrong , " @entity5 said			2
" in many aspects , in fact , there have been many reforms in last three , four years			0
" " about my style , everybody has his personality , and this does not mean these are alternatives to each other			0
these could be complementary and inclusive in that sense			0
and i will , from academic life until now , i had the same personality , my personality did n't change and will not change			0

@entity5 : @entity40 airstrikes in @entity4 were necessary but not enough to beat @entity14
" if @entity14 goes , another radical organization may come in , " he says
all terrorist threats and " crimes against humanity " committed by @entity4 must end , he says
" we will do everything possible " to help " our brothers and sisters " in @entity72 , he says
