-- @entity2 's motorcycle journey from the @entity3 to @entity4 is somewhat reminiscent of " @entity5 , " which recount the @entity7 travels of revolutionary @entity8 on an old motorbike in search of his insurgent spirit			1
but @entity2 , 32 , who left a job as a trader in finance to travel the world , has not been in touch with his mother or girlfriend in @entity20 since january 25			1
that day he sent girlfriend @entity21 an ominous text via the @entity24 messenger app. " just got an hour and a half long escort out of some area it was too dangerous for me to be , " the message said			1
" stopping for lunch and ... voila @entity30			2
... gon na get back on the road soon			2
apparently there 's another military escort waiting for me in some other town ... i 'm running way late because of the crazy military stuff ... hopefully get a chance to talk to you tonight when i ( hopefully ) finally arrive			1
" he had checked out of a bed and breakfast in the southwestern @entity44 state of @entity45 and planned to travel to a beach in @entity47 , on the @entity49 , that was in the final scene of the film " @entity52 , " according to friends and family			1
" my son is a great communicator and he always lets me know -- because i 'm anxious -- as close as he can where he 's going to be or if he 's going to be out of touch , " his mother , @entity55 , told @entity0 saturday			2
@entity55 said she last heard from her son january 23			1
the phone connection was poor			2
he told her he 'd be out of cell phone and @entity30 range a few days			2
she said he called every january 29 , his late father 's birthday , " and when he did n't , i felt a misgiving but i thought maybe it would take a couple of days , " she said			2
" he did n't call			2
" then , @entity55 heard from a friend who recently returned from @entity45 , where vigilante self - defense groups in numerous communities have engaged in deadly confrontations with the @entity76 drug cartel			1
after vigilantes threatened to descend on a key cartel area last month , the @entity44 government sent in thousands of troops and police to try to keep the peace			1
the government has even joined forces with the vigilantes as the @entity76 become further entrenched in the agricultural state			2
" this is an area in @entity45 that has been very dangerous , " said @entity55 , who has been in contact with @entity87 , a website dedicated to sharing information and resources about @entity3 citizens missing in other countries			1
last week , @entity55 contacted both the @entity7 and @entity95 embassies in @entity44			1
her son , born in @entity95 , has dual citizenship			0
" the wheels of diplomatic work sometimes grind slowly , " she lamented			0
" they are on top of things as much as they can be			0
" @entity21 , 28 , was less diplomatic			0
" i just feeling pretty lost in terms of the help we are receiving , " she said			0
in a statement saturday , a @entity108 spokesperson confirmed that a @entity3 citizen was reported missing near @entity111 , @entity45 , but declined further comment " due to privacy considerations			0
" " when a @entity3 citizen is reported missing in @entity44 , the @entity3 embassy or @entity115 works with both the missing person 's family and @entity44 and @entity3 law enforcement agencies to locate the missing individual and return him or her to safety , " the statement said			1
" for missing person cases in @entity44 , @entity44 law enforcement institutions generally have jurisdiction and play the lead role in the conduct of investigations			1
we work closely with @entity44 authorities to monitor such cases and seek progress as quickly as possible			1
" in @entity44 , @entity133 officials told @entity0 that they have not yet confirmed that @entity2 is missing			1
@entity2 's friends and family remain hopeful that his disappearance is only temporary , another story to recount from his wild travels around the world -- from @entity140 , @entity141 , to @entity142 , @entity143 , and beyond			1
" i 've been chased with a gun in @entity147 , chipped my tooth on a gun that was shoved in my mouth in @entity151 and shot everything from a bazooka to a machine gun , an @entity155 to a @entity156 , " @entity2 wrote in his travel blog , a @entity145			1
" i 've been in some of the poorest and some of the most dangerous parts of the world and to many of the finest , and i still ca n't tell which i liked more			0
i think that life is a pilgrimage			0
" in an oct. 19 post , @entity2 described his latest journey on a type of vehicle he had no experience using			1
" i 've never ridden a motorcycle , " he wrote			2
" mostly , naturally , because i do n't know how			0
so tomorrow i 'm going to go to the @entity169 , get my motorcycle permit , buy a bike and hopefully figure out how to ride it home without crashing			1
which i 'm sure will be an adventure in itself			0
" he added , " then in the next 2 or 3 weeks i 'm going to drive it across @entity4 , through @entity175 , down to @entity143 for the @entity176 , and eventually south to @entity177 , which as far as i can tell from a map is about as far south as one can get on the continent			2
" he purchased a green 2002 @entity180			0
@entity55 said her son took a safety course and spent hours studying @entity184 videos on how to survive falls from bikes			0
still , the fact that he had never driven a motorcycle concerned her , she said			2
he promised not to travel faster than 55 mph , yet he took a nasty spill while speeding in @entity190 , @entity55 said			0
" he always tells me ' i take risks but i 'm not an idiot , ' " she said			0
@entity2 hoped to write about his experiences traveling around @entity4 , perhaps in a book			1
" my son was hoping that instead of a job in an office that he 'd be able to somehow use this trip to get enough followers who would maybe read a book that he would write , " @entity55 said			0
" he 's had some extraordinary adventures			0
he just loves people so			0
" @entity21 said @entity2 spent the last year saving money for the journey			1
" this trip was kind of him wanting to make it maybe a career or something , " she said			0
" this is what he loved			0
he wanted to try to figure out a way to keep doing it			0
he started a website and everything			0
" friends and family recently created the help find @entity2 page in @entity218 , with more than 5,000 likes			1
" he 's one of those people that every single person that he comes into contact with just loved him , " said @entity21 , who planned to meet @entity2 in @entity220			1
" everywhere that he 's been around the world , families took him in			0
everybody 's hoping that 's ... the end of this crazy story			0
somebody has taken him in , and it 'll be another one of his wild stories			0
" @entity0 's @entity234 in @entity235 , @entity236 in @entity44 and @entity237 in @entity20 contributed to this report .			1
