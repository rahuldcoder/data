@entity0 -- for years the practice by television companies during the 1960s of erasing videotapes containing original episodes of classic shows has frustrated fans			1
but every so often , a long - lost treasure is found in an attic or at the back of a garage to revive their faith			0
now it 's the turn of devotees of the time - travelling alien adventure tv show " @entity22 , " who were on monday enthusing on @entity19 about the discovery of two episodes that were believed to have been wiped long ago			1
tapes of the two @entity24 shows , " @entity26 part three " starring @entity27 and " @entity29 part two " with @entity30 , were bought at a school fete by former tv engineer @entity32 in the 1980s			2
he kept them at home for many years , and was only recently alerted to the fact that the @entity24 did not own them			0
the footage was shown at the @entity43 's annual " @entity42 " event at the @entity40 in @entity0 hosted by actor @entity41			1
he said : " @entity44 has come early for @entity22 fans everywhere , " according to the @entity46			1
" it 's always wonderful when a missing episode turns up but it 's been years since the last one so to have two is just brilliant			2
add to that a proper bit of action from the legendary @entity51 ( and the horrifying @entity52 ! ) plus the utterly mesmeric @entity30 on great form			0
well , what more could we all ask for ? " on @entity19 , fans were similarly euphoric about the rediscovered episodes , which date from the mid- 60s			2
@entity58 said : " @entity59 lost dr who eps that broadcast 47 years ago and bounced off stuff in deep space : coolest thing possible			0
" broadcasters started to record tv programs for transmission in the late 1950s , but because videotape was so expensive , they were wiped clean for reuse afterwards			1
because of this more than 100 episodes of " @entity22 " from the 1960s were lost			1
the latest discoveries are the first complete episodes to be rediscovered since 2004			0
details of any commercial release for the rediscovered episodes will be announced next year .			0
