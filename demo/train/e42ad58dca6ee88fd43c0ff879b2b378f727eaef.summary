-- a black @entity2 employee who resigned after a video clip surfaced of her talking about a white farmer said tuesday her remarks were taken out of context			1
@entity7 , the department 's former state director of rural development for @entity10 , told @entity0 the incident she discusses in the clip took place more than two decades ago -- and that she recounted it to an audience to make the point that people should move beyond race			1
" i was speaking to that group , like i 've done many groups , and i tell them about a time when i thought the issue was race and race only , " @entity7 told @entity0 's " @entity26 " from her home in @entity19 , @entity10			1
the incident took place in 1986 , while she worked for a nonprofit and before she worked for the @entity2 , she said			2
" i was telling the story of how working with him helped me to see the issue is not about race			2
it 's about those who have versus those who do not have			2
" @entity7 resigned monday after conservative media outlets aired the video , in which she says she did not give the white farmer " the full force of what i could do " to help him avoid foreclosure			1
conservative website publisher @entity45 originally posted the video , which was quickly picked up by @entity47			0
the video claims @entity7 's remarks were delivered march 27 to an @entity50 banquet , but it is not clear that is the case , nor is it clear where the event was held or how many people were in attendance			1
the poor - quality video shows @entity7 telling her audience that the farmer she was working with " took a long time ... trying to show me he was superior to me			1
" as a result , she said , she " did n't give him the full force of what i could do			1
" to prove she had done her job , she said , she took him to a white lawyer			2
" i figured that if i take him to one of them , that his own kind would take care of him , " she said			0
@entity7 mentioned that the lawyer would help the farmer with a bankruptcy filing but did not say in the clip whether his farm was saved			2
she told @entity0 that at the time , she was working with a nonprofit association aimed at assisting farmers in @entity10 and the @entity77			0
in the end , she said , the lawyer did not help the farmer and she " had to frantically find a lawyer who would file a chapter 11 to stop the foreclosure			0
" she said she , the farmer and his wife wound up being friends			0
agriculture secretary @entity86 said monday he had accepted @entity7 's resignation			1
" there is zero tolerance for discrimination at @entity2 , and i strongly condemn any act of discrimination against any person , " @entity86 said			0
" we have been working hard through the past 18 months to reverse the checkered civil rights history at the department and take the issue of fairness and equality very seriously			0
" @entity7 told the @entity100 there were white people , including a mayor , at the banquet where she spoke			1
" why would i do something racist if they were there ? " the @entity50 issued a statement late monday backing @entity86 's decision			1
" racism is about the abuse of power			0
@entity7 had it in her position at @entity2			2
according to her remarks , she mistreated a white farmer in need of assistance because of his race , " said @entity116 , president and ceo of the civil rights group			1
" we are appalled by her actions , just as we are with abuses of power against farmers of color and female farmers			0
" " her actions were shameful , " @entity116 continued			0
" while she went on to explain in the story that she ultimately realized her mistake , as well as the common predicament of working people of all races , she gave no indication she had attempted to right the wrong she had done to this man			2
" @entity7 said it was " unfortunate that the @entity50 would make a statement without even checking to see what happened			1
this was 24 years ago , and i 'm telling a story to try to unite people			1
" she said she tried to explain to @entity2 officials , " but for some reason , the stuff @entity148 and the @entity149 does is scaring the administration			0
i told them to get the whole tape and look at the whole tape and see how i tell people we have to get beyond race and work together			0
" asked why did she resigned instead of fought , @entity7 said , " i did n't have any support from @entity2			2
what would i do ? " @entity161 , assistant professor of @entity163 and @entity164 studies at @entity165 in @entity166 , @entity167 , called the clip " a textbook case of institutional racism			0
historically , it 's been white against black , or white against whatever person of color is in question , but this is still institutional racism			2
we ca n't endorse it			0
" but he said , given later remarks made by @entity7 in the clip , " it 's clear that this is an anecdote ... it is clear she is using this as an anecdote to talk about how she 's progressed from this moment , and we ca n't let the weight of historical issues with race shape our individual issues			1
" i think she is using this an anecdote to work through her own issues but also to show the audience we can move beyond and transcend some of these circumstances , " he said			0
the conservative media outlets tied the video to the @entity50 's recent resolution calling on the @entity149 movement to repudiate racist elements within it that have displayed such items as images of president @entity206 with a bone through his nose and the @entity209 with a lawn full of watermelons			1
the controversy has led one @entity149 group to oust another because of a blog posting by the second group 's leader			0
@entity219 leader @entity218 posted on his blog a faux letter from @entity50 president @entity116 to president @entity222 in which @entity218 ridicules the organization 's use of " colored " in its historic name and uses multiple other stereotypes to bolster his point			1
the @entity228 expelled @entity218 ' organization from its coalition as a result .			0
