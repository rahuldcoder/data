-- a new diet drug approved by the @entity2 in july is now available for obese and at - risk overweight patients			1
the oral medication @entity5 can only be obtained with a doctor 's prescription			2
@entity5 ( pronounced kyoo - @entity9 - uh ) is the second diet drug approved this year			1
the @entity2 approved a weight - loss pill called @entity12 on june 27			1
patients in clinical trials experienced more dramatic weight loss with @entity5 than with @entity12			2
on @entity5 , patients went from an average 227 pounds to 204 pounds ; on @entity12 , the average weight dropped from 220 to 207			2
@entity5 had been known as @entity5 until its approval			2
the @entity2 asked the company to change the name to avoid confusion with another drug on the market , according to the company			2
health care costs to bulge along with @entity27 waistlines some consumer advocates worry that the medication 's weight loss comes with a price			1
some patients in the clinical trial suffered an increased heart rate and a condition called metabolic acidosis , which can lead to hyperventilation , fatigue and anorexia			1
concerns have also been raised about birth defects			1
one of the ingredients in @entity5 is topiramate , an anti-convulsant that has been linked to birth defects such as cleft lip and cleft palate in babies born to women who have taken it for migraines or seizures			1
@entity5 's other ingredient is phentermine , an appetite suppressant			2
" our belief is that women will be invited ( through ) compelling advertising and marketing messages to experiment on themselves with a drug that has some effectiveness with healthy weight loss but possible serious risks , " said @entity56 , executive director of the @entity57			0
@entity5 's manufacturer , @entity66 , says that the drug helped lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels in obese people and that people taking it were less likely to get type ii diabetes			1
not enough good data to back obesity drug , panel says " obesity is not being adequately addressed by diet and lifestyle changes or currently available therapies , " the company said			2
" the need for new options is urgent , particularly nonsurgical options			0
" the @entity2 approved @entity5 only for obese people or for overweight people with a body mass index greater than 27 who also suffer from weight - related conditions like hypertension and diabetes			1
doctors are free to prescribe the drug to anyone , however , and there are concerns that physicians will open " pill mills " and prescribe @entity5 to people who just want to lose a few pounds			2
that 's what happened in the 1990s with fen - phen , another diet drug combination that includes phentermine			1
an @entity2 advisory committee voted against @entity5 's approval in 2010			1
the panel recommended the drug 's approval with a 20 - 2 vote in february , after @entity66 proposed a risk management program to limit @entity5 's distribution and published additional results from one of its three clinical trials			1
@entity66 is offering the pill only through mail order , so doctors ca n't sell it directly , said dr. @entity117 , @entity66 ' vice president of scientific communications and risk management			0
" there will not be dispensing from doctors ' offices , " she said			0
" seeing that issue and what has happened in fad and diet drugs in the past , that is not a path that we 're going to be taking			0
" the 4,430 overweight and obese patients in the @entity5 studies experienced various levels of weight loss			1
about half of patients on the recommended dose lost 10 % of their weight , while four - fifths lost 5 %			0
that amounts to about 12 pounds for a 227 - pound person			0
@entity140 , one of the patients , started out at 230 pounds and lost 48 pounds her first year on the drug and another two pounds the second year			0
" i loved it , " she said			0
" i was n't hungry			0
i almost had to remind myself to eat			0
" at 5 feet 9 inches tall , @entity144 , now 63 , describes herself as having been " @entity147 - like " in college , weighing 120 pounds			0
then she gained weight after having four children			0
an avid cook and eater , she said the drug made it easier to resist tempting foods			0
@entity2 advisers recommend diet drug " if i saw a chocolate - chip cookie , it was easy enough for me to say , ' i 'm not really hungry			1
i can pass on it , ' " @entity144 said			0
she said the weight came off gradually , about four pounds a month , and her blood pressure went down almost immediately			0
in february , dr. @entity162 was one of two @entity2 advisory committee members who voted against @entity5 's approval			1
" i believe that if the public were to ' buy ' ( @entity5 ) after @entity2 approval , it would run the risk of severe , even fatal , consequences from another diet lemon , " @entity162 wrote in @entity165 , also noting that the drug led to a slight increase in heart rates			1
the @entity2 and @entity66 both acknowledge that the three clinical trials meant to measure @entity5 's safety and effectiveness were not designed to properly assess cardiovascular risk			1
the @entity2 has required @entity66 to do a study on the drug 's cardiovascular effects			2
@entity66 earlier said it would be done after the drug 's approval			0
despite the label 's warning that women of childbearing age should use birth control while on @entity5 , there are concerns that women will still get pregnant while on the drug			1
the @entity2 recommends a pregnancy test every month while on @entity5			1
in the drug - maker 's two - year clinical trial , 34 women on @entity5 became pregnant , even though they were told repeatedly to use contraception			2
no birth defects happened in those pregnancies , according to the company			2
previous clinical trials of topiramate , one of the ingredients in @entity5 , have shown a risk of about five birth defects for every 1,000 pregnancies			1
comparing the anti-obesity drug to treatments for other chronic diseases , @entity117 said patients will probably need to continue taking @entity5 long - term , though the new drug is not expected to be widely covered by health insurance plans			1
@entity2 rejects another obesity drug @entity144 , the patient who lost 50 pounds on the drug , said she has gained back about 20 pounds since the clinical trial ended two years ago and looks forward to going on @entity5 once it 's approved , even though it can have side effects			1
" there are side effects to everything , " she said			0
she added that the drug was n't the only reason she lost weight			0
weekly counseling on nutrition and exercise were a big factor , too			0
the counselor helped her change her diet -- choosing a salad for lunch instead of a burger , forgoing pasta and potatoes at dinner -- and encouraged her to walk a few times a week in addition to her regular exercise as goalie in a women 's soccer league			0
" before the medicine , i had been telling the girls they 'd have to find a new goalie , because i could n't dive for the ball like i did before , " she said			0
" then i lost the weight , and i was diving and bouncing back up and having a great old time again			0

new diet drug is now available with a prescription for obese or at - risk overweight patients
