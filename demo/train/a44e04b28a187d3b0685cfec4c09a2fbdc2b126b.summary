-- over the last decade , @entity1 has taken the " one for them , one for me " concept of film - director politics to an almost comically programmatic extreme			1
@entity6 plays @entity7 in @entity1 's biopic			1
basically , he makes big - budget crowd - pleasers like the " @entity11 's " films , stuffed with movie stars and candied gimcrack fun , and between them he makes whatever oddball labor - of - love doodle ( the enticing " bubble , " the dreadful " @entity17 " ) enters his head			2
what 's disorienting about " @entity20 , " his two - part , four - hour - and - 17 - minute , studiously eccentric drama about the revolutionary life and times of @entity7 , is that it 's almost a knowing brainteaser on @entity1 's part to force you to figure out which category the film belongs to			1
@entity20 cost a reported $ 65 million to make , it 's full of exacting panoramas of strategy and combat set in the mountainous jungles of @entity34 and @entity35 , and its hero is a figure who -- 41 years after his violent death -- remains so loved , hated , and mythologized that he fits into an epic drama timed for awards season as perfectly as @entity43 or @entity44 ever did			1
following a one - week oscar - qualifying run , " @entity20 " is now rolling out to major @entity47 cities , where it is likely to draw generations of filmgoers who 've either worn @entity20 on their t - shirts or have the honest curiosity to wonder : who was this man before he became a @entity56 - worthy icon of radical chic ? in " @entity20 , " @entity1 stokes that curiosity , feeds it , and frustrates it , all at the same time			1
he 's made a film that embraces the romance of revolution only to shake it off , leaving very little in its place			2
the first half of " @entity20 " is a genuine achievement			1
it picks up @entity7 ( @entity6 ) in 1955 , when he was a clean - cut @entity66 physician who dreamed of uniting @entity67 through armed struggle			1
at a dinner party in @entity70 , he meets @entity71 -- played , with perfect domineering gesticulations , by @entity73 -- and the movie follows these two into the @entity34 countryside , where they assemble the nuts and bolts of a revolution			0
@entity1 exhibits a tinkerer 's fascination with how it all worked , embedding each scene with a docu - nugget of information			1
we see @entity20 taming his asthmatic coughing fits or reading books between battles , and learn how a battalion of rebels could defeat a platoon three times its size ( with surprise , daring , and @entity96 cocktails )			2
@entity20 is by turns scholar , guidance counselor , drill sergeant , and comandante , and @entity101 makes him a warrior - saint who learns , against his will , to cultivate a gruff bruiser facade			2
he yearns to be a " true revolutionary , the highest level of humanity , " and it 's no insult to the film to say that @entity1 and @entity101 succeed in portraying @entity20 as a kind of t - shirt in three dimensions , a guerrilla for all seasons			1
but that 's when things get strange , if not monumentally perverse			0
at the end of @entity120 -- the victory of the @entity34 rebels -- my appetite was whetted to learn even more about @entity20 , in particular how his humane ideals were tested , and compromised , by the @entity71 regime as it edged toward dictatorship			2
instead , @entity126 leaps forward to 1966 - 67 , when @entity20 led the revolutionary war in @entity35 , and here 's the thing : it turns out to be the same damn movie			1
only in this dispirited rerun , the revolution does n't take			0
the rebels , all squabbling ego , can barely summon the will to sacrifice and die , and the peasants have little belief that this ragtag crew is bringing a better world			0
even with the @entity47 poking its nose into the region , the @entity141 wo n't back an insurrection			0
@entity1 has built " @entity20 " conceptually , as two giant panels of war , and his message is about the doomed destiny of @entity149			1
@entity20 , like @entity150 , believed that the rise of the proletariat was inevitable -- the unstoppable tide of history -- but as the movie reveals , he was wrong			0
@entity20 did n't ride a wave of history ; instead , it crashed down on him			0
by remaining the same , he becomes , in @entity126 , a distant and deluded figure whose dream evaporates around him			0
as political theater , " @entity20 " moves from faith to impotence , which is certainly a valid reading of @entity163 in the 20th century			0
yet as drama , that makes the second half of the film borderline deadly			0
@entity20 does n't grow richer , deeper , or reveal any contradictions ; he just gets more abstract -- a symbol of idealism too pure for this world			0
@entity20 is twice as long as it needs to be , but it is also only half the movie it should have been			2

" @entity20 " has a *brilliant* first half , but second half is *repetitious* , says @entity0
@entity1 's four - hour film is trying to make a point , but loses steam
however , @entity6 is terrific as famed @entity194 revolutionary
