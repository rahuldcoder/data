-- @entity1 has done what many bands strive to do : make commercial indie - sounding pop , which is kind of an oxymoron , like " jumbo shrimp " or " daily special			1
" " we 've grown up on the @entity8 and the @entity9 and @entity10 and @entity11 and the @entity12			2
also @entity13 and @entity14 , " said the trio 's frontman , @entity1			1
" those are all artists who write songs that are accessible but still left of center			0
it 's intelligent pop. there 's still something different and complex about it			2
that 's our favorite type of music to make			2
" @entity1 's old day job as a jingle writer proved to be great training ground for creating punchy hooks			1
the @entity32 - based group is now up for a pair of @entity34 : @entity36 for their smash single " @entity35 " and @entity38 for their debut cd , " torches			0
" on the evening @entity0 interviewed @entity1 backstage at @entity32 's @entity42 , the guest list was an inconceivable mix of @entity44 , a couple of kids from " @entity47 " and @entity48 from @entity49			1
while the other guys looked forward to seeing @entity44 at their show , @entity1 seemed more impressed by @entity48			1
" when i was a kid and started playing the guitar , that 's who i listened to , and i learned how to play the guitar because of that guy			2
so it 's crazy that he 's coming , " he said , shaking his head			2
" but you never know who 's going to be here , especially when you play @entity32 @entity63 ( of @entity64 ) was at our last show , which was pretty crazy			1
" but counting a couple of hard rock icons as fans is n't as random as one might think			2
lurking beneath the shiny bubble - gum surface of @entity1 lies a dark theme or two -- particularly in " @entity35 , " in which a teen shooter tells potential victims they 'd " better run , better run , faster than my bullet			1
" other songs seem to be an internal running dialogue in @entity1 's head			1
the band 's current single , " @entity86 ) , " is a pep talk to push creative boundaries and seize the moment			2
@entity1 , bassist @entity1 and drummer @entity1 recently spoke with @entity0 about what this moment in time is like for @entity1			1
@entity0 : you guys got together as a band in 2009			0
it 's been a fast ride			1
@entity1 : i think it 's funny , because we 've all worked towards a career in music for a long time			1
for so many years , it was slow , playing in front of rooms full of 10 people and trying to get your friends to come -- begging your friends to come -- telling them you 'll pay for their parking			0
just whatever you could do to get them in there			0
and then all of a sudden , it kind of took off			0
it 's been a fast incline , so we 've had to just work really hard , keep our heads down and just stay grounded			1
at the same time , we 've had a lot of fun during the process			1
@entity0 : i hear @entity121 is a fan			1
@entity1 : yeah , the last time we played in @entity122 , we ended up at @entity121 's house and had dinner with him and got to hang out with him for a few hours			1
we just talked about music and art and poetry and just all the things that you maybe expect @entity121 to talk about			1
we walked away and were really inspired			0
@entity1 : i missed the @entity121 experience			1
it was on our day off in @entity133 , and i just turned my phone off and kind of relaxed			0
i ended up turning it on in the afternoon and seeing 25 missed calls and a hundred texts saying , " hey , we 're going to the bbq			2
@entity1 : but you did get to watch a rugby game , did n't you			1
@entity0 : are you critical when you hear your songs on the radio ? @entity1 : i think now i just kind of turn the station off when the stuff comes on			1
i was hanging out with a girl in @entity150 , and we were in a cab , and " @entity35 " came on , and she told the cab driver , " hey , can you turn this rubbish off ? ! " it 's like , " thank you			2
she 's reading my mind			2
" @entity0 : on the surface , your songs sound pretty happy - go - lucky			2
but some of them are pretty dark , like " @entity35 , " which is about a teenager with a gun			2
@entity1 : i like to write about real - life topics , and i like to write about different walks of life			1
for me , that song was really an observation about something that 's happening in the youth culture these days			1
i guess i wanted to reveal that internal dialogue of a kid who does n't have anywhere to turn , and i think the song has kind of done its job			0
i think people are talking about it , and it 's become a point of conversation , which i think is a really healthy thing			1
@entity0 : did you feel like outsiders in high school ? @entity1 : i experienced bullying a lot			1
i was an only child , and i was kind of a small kid with a big mouth , and so i always got myself in trouble			0
so i grew up kind of having to scrap			0
and i grew up in @entity190			0
it 's pretty blue collar , and kids know how to fight there , so that was a real thing , for sure			1
@entity142 : the whole youth violence thing hit pretty close to me			1
my cousin was part of the ordeal at @entity200			0
she was actually in the library when everything went down , so i actually flew out to be with her the day after it happened and experienced the trauma surrounding it and saw how affected she was by it			0
she is as close as a sister , so obviously , it affected me deeply			0
so to be able to have a song to create a platform to talk about this stuff has been good for us			0
@entity0 : what 's inspiring you guys these days ? @entity1 : i 've been thinking a lot about the political state of where we 're at right now			1
there 's a lot i 'm not happy about and would love to talk more about it			0
i think that musicians have a voice that is sometimes louder than anyone else 's voice , in a sense			0
also , doing charity work and humanitarian work is something that we 've been really into on this last tour			2
we 've teamed up with the @entity232 , which followed us around			0
we 've done something with local charities in every city that we 've stopped in , so i think going into the ( next ) record , we 'll see where things are at			0
but we 're also a new band , and we do n't want to get too bleeding heart too early			0
i think you have to keep it about the music for a while before you start preaching too much			0
@entity0 : what do you have up your sleeve for @entity1 's second record ? @entity1 : we 're going to try to continue to push the envelope			1
a lot of what we 've learned touring this year is that the percussion element of what we do live is something that we 'd love to bring into the studio and do more of on our second record			0
and just pushing the envelope with the electronic music and also working on some classic songwriting , which we have n't really put our much of yet			0
i like classic soul , so we 'll see			0
it 's going to be interesting			0
@entity0 : before @entity1 took off , you all had some odd jobs			2
@entity1 : we were delivery boys at one point , funny enough , delivering coffee and cheese to @entity265 sometimes just down the street			2
we all had weird , odd jobs , and living in @entity32 , struggling to be a musician is tough sometimes , and you just want to give up			0
but you got ta stick to it			0
@entity1 : at the same time , those odd jobs , sometimes looking back , were the most fun times that i 've had , as well			1
but when you 're in it , it sucks .			0
