-- @entity2 gov. @entity1 on wednesday signed three gun - control measures into law , including one that will require universal background checks for gun sales			1
the measures also will make buyers pay for their own background checks and limit ammunition magazines to 15 rounds			2
the @entity2 laws go into effect july 1			1
what is a universal background check ? @entity18 passed new gun - control legislation after the december killings at @entity21 , but it already had some of the stiffest gun laws in the country			1
@entity2 , where firearms are almost as much a part of the landscape as the @entity28 , is a different case			1
it 's long been a politically conservative state , voting @entity32 just once in the 10 presidential elections that followed @entity35 's 1964 landslide			1
but in recent years , its political center of gravity has tilted leftward : it went for @entity39 in 2008 and 2012 , voted to legalize recreational marijuana last year , and state lawmakers this year voted to allow civil unions for same - sex couples			2
then there 's also the bloody history of the past decade or so -- the mass shootings at @entity47 in @entity48 and a movie theater in @entity50 , both @entity52 suburbs			0
still , it took the december killings at @entity21 " to really wake up @entity56 's conscience and realize that there were better solutions , " said @entity59 , whose daughter , @entity60 , died at @entity50			0
gun - rights advocates call the @entity2 bills unenforceable , feel - good measures that are likely to backfire			1
@entity64 owns a 2,000 - acre bird - hunting preserve in @entity66 , on the prairie northeast of @entity52			2
he says his clients are unhappy with the new legislation , particularly language that limits shotguns to eight rounds			0
" they 're upset to the point where it 's like they feel @entity2 is being stereotyped as a gun - control state , " @entity64 said			1
that 's going to keep businesses from moving to the state and hunters from visiting , he said			0
already , he said , out - of - state customers are telling him they 've made their last visit			2
@entity84 , a manager at the @entity50 gun store and range @entity86 , said the 15 - round restrictions on rifle magazines are " poorly worded " and are likely to affect owners of nearly every magazine			1
he said sheriffs consider the new legislation unenforceable , and the $ 10 limit on charging individual buyers for background checks is far below the $ 50 a store typically charges for handling a transfer			0
@entity59 said the obstacles are small compared to the potential price			0
" let 's say it takes $ 10 and 10 minutes of your time , and it 's going to protect somebody from getting a gun that they should n't have , " she said			0
" ten dollars and 10 minutes is worth the time that it takes to save a life			0
" @entity2 voted to make background checks for gun - show purchases mandatory after @entity47 , when investigators learned that the weapons used by the teenage killers were bought by an 18 - year - old at a gun show to avoid a background check			1
the buyer , @entity120 , later told a state @entity123 committee that the gun purchases had been " too easy			0
" @entity0 's @entity125 and @entity126 contributed to this report .			0
