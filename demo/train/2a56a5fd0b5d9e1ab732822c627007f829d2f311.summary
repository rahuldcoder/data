-- it would take you almost five solid months -- without sleeping or bathroom breaks -- to watch every sporting event at this year 's @entity6			1
more than 3,500 hours of competition from @entity8 will be crammed into just 17 days			0
in the past , people had to settle for watching the delayed , edited bits broadcast on tv or websites , but technology and viewing habits have changed			1
this year , 40 % of people plan to follow the games on more than one device , with 35 % checking in on their tablets and 27 % using their smartphone , according to a new study by @entity22			1
fans asked to tweet from @entity6 only if it 's ' urgent ' so what are the best ways for today 's mobile , multiple - screen owning , @entity26 - loving generation to follow the @entity6 @entity31 la carte ? we offer these five : live streaming , with a catch first , the good news : it 's finally possible to stream any @entity38 event live online , on a tablet or from your smartphone			1
after years of tape - delayed broadcasts and online video , @entity42 has caught on that viewers want to follow the @entity6 on multiple devices in real time , and is offering the live options in addition to its regular television programming			1
the bad news is that anyone in the @entity53 who wants to enjoy live streaming of the games needs to have a current cable , satellite or telco tv subscription that includes @entity59 and @entity60 ( for some areas this may mean be more than just basic cable )			1
you will be prompted on the @entity42 site and in @entity42 apps to choose your provider from a list and log in with your official username and password in order to access any live streams			1
cord cutters -- those who have canceled their cable and primarily watch tv online through services like @entity78 and @entity79 -- are out of luck , however			1
they can sign up for cable and cancel after the games are over , but there 's no one - time payment option just to access live streaming			1
@entity42 wants mobile and online options to complement the tv coverage , not replace it			1
@entity42 , which is owned by the largest cable provider in the @entity53 , @entity90 , paid $ 1.18 billion for the rights to this year 's @entity6			1
the network makes a good portion of that amount back on television advertising , which still generates more revenue than online ads. online the internet portal for all video in the @entity53 is @entity100			1
on the main video page , anyone can view the select clips that @entity42 posts after watching a short ad			0
these clips are a combination of highlights from events , interviews , profiles , and peeks behind the scenes			2
sort by your sport of choice or type of video			0
how to avoid @entity6 spoilers the site is also providing live streams of any sport to cable , satellite or telco tv subscribers			1
called @entity126 , the service will live stream some @entity38 trials and every single @entity38 sport			2
you can watch online or through the complimentary app. it 's the only option for live streaming in the @entity53 @entity134 hosted through @entity135 , all of the videos on the @entity138 are in @entity139			1
to view them on @entity141 , @entity142 or other mobile devices , go to the mobile version of the site , m.nbcolympics.com			0
you can also download one of the official apps to watch official @entity38 video on your @entity150 or @entity152 device			2
for the first time , the @entity153 ( @entity153 ) will live stream 11 high - definition channels simultaneously over @entity135 for 64 territories in @entity158 and @entity159 that do n't have broadcast deals , but those streams will not be accessible outside of those countries			1
foreign news websites such as the @entity164 will also have videos , but again , most will be blocked for @entity53 viewers			1
mobile apps @entity42 created two official apps for @entity152 and @entity170 mobile devices , @entity171 and @entity172 , and both are free to download			0
@entity171 has no live video , but tons of content that can be enjoyed by anyone for free , including news , results , video highlights , and the intriguing - sounding @entity26 heat map			2
@entity172 app is a mobile version of its @entity126 online service and requires a cable , satellite or telco subscription			1
view any event live , watch replays of the ones you missed , and check out medal ceremonies and alternative camera views			1
look over the in - app schedule and set up notifications for the events you do n't want to miss. ( @entity198 streamers should be careful not to go over their monthly data limits			2
) there are two official apps for the @entity202 , and they 're available for a mix of platforms including @entity205 , @entity152 , @entity206 and @entity207			0
official @entity202 : @entity208 has live updates of results , as well as schedules , news , background on sports and athlete profiles			2
you can follow specific countries and set up custom alerts			0
the second app , @entity220 : join in app , is more for people attending the games , and has schedules and locations for the various @entity38 - related festivities going on in @entity8			0
the free @entity164 @entity205 and @entity152 app will have a steady stream of quality @entity6 news , including a running tally of medals won and live reporting from the @entity164 journalists attending events			1
social media and news perhaps you have no interest in seeing your favorite diver 's perfectly executed reverse 3 1/2 somersault tuck			0
you just want to know who got the gold as soon as it happens			0
individual sports have official , automated @entity26 feeds that will tweet out the results as they happen			0
you can narrow it down to just the events you 're interested in and follow those feeds ( say @entity249 ) , or keep an eye on all of them at once by following the @entity202 official @entity26 list of automated feeds			2
the official @entity202 feed is @ @entity202			0
@entity26 takes the @entity38 gold for speed this year a lot of the fun will be following the athletes themselves			2
you can look up your favorites or follow this list of verified @entity38 athlete @entity26 accounts , the @entity202 list of @entity261 or find a list just for your preferred sport of team , like @entity270			0
if you want more color , find a hashtag for the event you 're interested in to get live tweets of the excitement as it happens from attendees and journalists			2
there 's also an official @entity8 2012 @entity282 page you can like to get updates			0
and of course , there are old - fashioned news sites and blogs filled with words and pictures			0
there are 21,000 journalists in @entity8 covering the @entity6 ( outnumbering the 10,500 athletes competing )			0
with all the content online , on tv and on social media , keeping up with the @entity6 wo n't be nearly as much of a challenge as avoiding spoilers			2
television oh right , there 's tv , too			0
if you have cable , you can catch @entity42 's coverage scattered across a number of its channels : @entity42 , @entity305 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity306 and @entity307			0
check the schedule for your location , sorted by time or sport , at the @entity171 site			0
if you do n't have cable , you can still tune into @entity42 over the air for nearly round - the - clock coverage , including the four - hour prime - time broadcast that will show the most popular events mixed in with the usual profiles and athlete interviews			1
the channel will broadcast a total of 217 hours of @entity38 coverage			0
opinion : is it really # @entity326 ?			0
