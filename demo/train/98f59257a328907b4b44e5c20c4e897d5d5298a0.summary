in the midst of chaos here on @entity4 , scientists are finding hope for life on other planets			1
scientists announced thursday the discovery of three planets that are some of the best candidates so far for habitable worlds outside our own solar system -- and they 're very far away			1
@entity16 's @entity15 satellite , which is keeping an eye on more than 150,000 stars in hopes of identifying @entity4 - like planets , found the trio			1
two of the planets -- kepler - 62e and kepler - 62f -- are described in a study released thursday in the journal @entity27			1
they are part of a five - planet system in which the candidates for life are the farthest from the host star			2
their host star -- which corresponds to @entity4 's sun , but is smaller and cooler -- takes the name @entity39			2
the star 's planets are designated by letters after the star 's name			2
a third planet that 's potentially habitable , but not included in the @entity27 study , is called @entity15 - 69c			1
a study about it and its system is published in @entity50			0
these are the smallest planets ever found in the " habitable zone , " the area near a star in which a planet can theoretically hold liquid water			1
kepler - 69c seems less clearly in the habitable zone than the other two planets , but scientists have n't ruled it out			1
" with all of these discoveries we 're finding , @entity4 is looking less and less like a special place and more like there 's @entity4 - like things everywhere , " said @entity63 , @entity15 scientist at the @entity64 in @entity65 , @entity66			1
you wo n't be swimming on the planets anytime soon , though			2
the kepler - 62 star is 1,200 light - years away ; @entity75 is 2,700 light - years away			1
a light - year , the distance that light travels in a vacuum in one year , is nearly 6 trillion miles			1
what are these planets like ? the smaller a planet is , the more likely it 's rocky and the less likely it 's made of gas , said @entity86 , @entity15 science principal investigator at @entity87			1
that makes @entity89 , thought to be 40 % larger than @entity4 , potentially the most like our planet out of the new discoveries			0
it could be rocky , @entity86 said , with polar caps , land mass and water as well			0
it goes around its star once every 267.3 days ( @entity4 days , that is )			0
if you were standing on kepler - 62f , the star in the sky would look bigger than our sun does , but " the illumination level would be like walking around on @entity4 on a cloudy day , " @entity86 said at a press briefing			1
" it drops by a factor of five			0
" kepler - 62e appears to be 60 % larger than our planet and a little closer to its host star ; this one could be a " water world " of mostly deep oceans , he said			1
it circles its star in 122.4 days			0
" all these planets that we 're finding are quite different than planets in our own solar system , " @entity86 said			0
kepler - 69c appears to orbit a star similar to @entity4 's sun , @entity63 said			1
as it 's estimated to be about 70 % larger than @entity4 , it may also be a water world , with oceans thousands of kilometers deep			0
this planet is also exciting because it is the smallest scientists have found that orbits a sun - like star in the habitable zone			1
it 's not likely to have a rocky surface , @entity63 said			0
according to what little we know about it , kepler - 69c is probably significantly warmer than @entity4 and could be more like @entity138			1
" probably , if there is life , it would be very unlike what we see on our own world , " @entity63 said			0
if scientists ' notions of a " habitable zone " were applied to our own solar system , both @entity4 and @entity145 would fit the bill			1
but @entity145 does n't have enough gravity to hold onto an atmosphere that could heat it sufficiently , said @entity154 , research group leader at the @entity155 in @entity156 , @entity157 , in a press conference			0
still , the @entity145 rover curiosity has uncovered evidence that the @entity145 was , indeed , hospitable to life in the past			0
other worlds that may have life @entity86 said the new planets are " by far " better candidates for life than any others we know about , but a handful of others also have been identified as potentially capable of hosting life			0
you may recall planet @entity174 , which was announced in december 2011 and also was hailed as a potential candidate for hosting life			0
that planet had a radius 2.4 times that of @entity4 and is 600 light - years away			1
@entity174 was thought to have a temperature similar to that of @entity4 , according to modeling by @entity86 and colleagues			0
the planet 's host star is dimmer and cooler than our sun , but the planet is also 15 % closer than we are to the sun. there is also a planet called @entity192 , discovered in september 2010 , which is thought to be even more like @entity4 than kepler - 22b in terms of its suitability for plants and animals			1
it 's only 20 light - years from @entity4 -- a lot closer than the newly discovered planets , though there has been some controversy about its existence			1
in its solar system there is another planet , @entity207 - 581d , that is also of interest in the search for life , according to the @entity212 at the @entity213 at @entity214			0
the group 's catalog lists a few other candidates			0
however , just like the other planets , we have n't seen or tested the atmospheres of any of these planets , so whether they 're habitable remains theoretical			2
often , when you find an example of a kind of planet , you start seeing a lot of them , said @entity229 , professor of planetary science at @entity231			0
she used to be part of the @entity15 team but is now independent			2
" planets in the habitable zones of stars must be everywhere , " she said			1
@entity229 called the discovery of the three planets " a huge milestone , " but her excitement is tempered because potentially habitable planets have been announced in the past and there 's currently no way to get more details , given how far away they are			2
" we 'll possibly never know if these particular ones do have water oceans or signs of life , " she said			0
more space news on @entity254 's @entity253 identifying planets , not atmospheres the goal of the @entity15 mission was n't to find alien lifeforms , however			1
the satellite is supposed to investigate @entity4 - sized planets around stars that resemble our sun. the @entity15 telescope , launched in 2009 , allows scientists to measure changes in brightness of individual stars over time ; these dimming events signal that a planet is nearby			1
scientists undertake sophisticated calculations to verify that such signals are planets and not passing rocks			2
the satellite finds planets that are very far away because it 's surveying so many stars			2
imagine , said @entity229 , that you are in @entity283 and you want to see 150,000 people at once			0
you would n't be able to do it in such a way that you could see any details of the people ; you 'd have to get far enough away that that many people would fit into your field of view			0
in total , @entity15 has found 122 confirmed planets and more than 2,700 planet candidates			2
a total of seven confirmed planets were announced thursday -- the three in the habitable zone , and four others that are not			1
this is n't the only planet - finding technique			0
the @entity303 was found with the @entity304 in @entity305 , using what is called the radial velocity method			0
the telescope 's spectrometer allows scientists to look for wobbles in the motion of a star , which happens in response to the gravity of nearby planets			2
it would take a different kind of mission to investigate the atmosphere of one of these distance planets to find out answers to the most - pressing questions			2
is there carbon dioxide and water ? is there oxygen ? " future @entity16 missions are going to focus on more nearby stars that we can look at in much more detail , " @entity63 said			0
you can read more about the @entity15 discoveries at the mission website			2
