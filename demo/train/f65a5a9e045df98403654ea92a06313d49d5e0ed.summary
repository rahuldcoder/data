judge @entity17 presided over the proceedings from a @entity0 courtroom , where people watched the arraignment			1

the lawyer asked that @entity2 undergo a full psychiatric evaluation , a request the judge granted			1
dressed in an orange jumpsuit and sitting at a brown table , @entity2 did not speak and showed no evident emotion during the proceedings			1
the next major step in the legal process would be for a grand jury to hear prosecutors ' evidence against @entity2 for a potential indictment , after the defense waived its right to an expedited indictment on friday			1
it is not clear when this might happen			0
earlier friday , @entity2 was sent to the hospital " because he 's on medications , and we prefer to administer those in a hospital setting , " said police spokesman @entity52 , who declined to elaborate on the medications			1

the boy was killed in the basement of a @entity13 building , according to the charging document filed late friday afternoon by the @entity13 district attorney 's office			1
" detectives believe in the credibility of the statement , " @entity70 said , although investigators had not uncovered any forensic evidence linking @entity2 to the boy 's disappearance			1
@entity70 said it is unlikely that @entity61 's remains would be found			2
@entity67 investigation a 33 - year - long roller coaster ride " he did the right thing , you know , to confess , " @entity2 's brother - in - law @entity96 told @entity1 affiliate @entity97			1
" get this thing over with for the people out there and the family over here			0
" but @entity109 , whose 2009 book , " after @entity61 , " is widely considered the definitive account of the case , said she 's not convinced that @entity2 killed the boy			1
" no , i 'm not , but that 's not necessarily because he did n't do it , " she said			0
" that 's just because this has just happened			0
i 'd never heard his name before			0
" @entity2 has no criminal record and is the father of a teenage girl , @entity70 said			2
@entity61 , 6 , went missing on may 25 , 1979 , a block from his home in @entity13			0
he was walking to school alone for the first time when he vanished			0

" the @entity155 's investigation into the disappearance of @entity5 remains active and ongoing			1
we remain determined to solve this case , " @entity155 assistant director @entity159 said in the statement			0
thursday 's arrest came nearly a month after investigators searched the former basement workshop of carpenter @entity166 , who had given @entity61 a dollar the day before the boy 's disappearance for helping him around the shop			1
@entity61 had said before he disappeared that he planned to use the dollar to buy a soda			0
the search produced no apparent clues			0
" mr. @entity166 is relieved by these developments , as he was not involved in any way with @entity5 's disappearance , " said @entity166 's attorney , @entity175			2
" at the same time , mr. @entity166 is very pleased that those responsible for this heinous crime may be brought to justice , and the @entity67 family may finally have the closure they deserve			0
" a separate law enforcement source said thursday that @entity2 's claims were being treated with " a healthy dose of skepticism			1
" the tipster whose information led to @entity2 's arrest contacted authorities months ago after news coverage of their renewed search			1
that contact , at least in part , prompted investigators to question @entity2			2
a spokeswoman for the @entity13 district attorney 's office , which reopened the case in 2010 , declined to comment on the recent development			2
@entity61 was officially declared dead in 2001 as part of a lawsuit filed by his family against @entity206 , a drifter and convicted child molester acquainted with @entity61 's baby sitter			0
a judge found @entity210 responsible for the boy 's death and ordered him to pay the family $ 2 million , money the @entity67 family has never received			2
although @entity206 was considered a key focus of the investigation for years , he has never been charged in the case			2
he is serving a 20 - year prison sentence in @entity219 for molesting another boy and is set to be released this year			0
