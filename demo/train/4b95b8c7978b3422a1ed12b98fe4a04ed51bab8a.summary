@entity0 -- it can sometimes take a lot to stir passions in @entity5 , but a shocking @entity7 page and the stream of insults that followed have roused the @entity5 to a heated public debate about racism			1
the facebook page belonged to a local candidate from the far - right @entity15 political party , and compared justice minister @entity16 , who is black , to a monkey			1
the candidate was suspended but there were more , similar insults that followed -- including on the front page of a right - wing newspaper which featured the headline " clever as a monkey " alongside a photo of @entity16			1
the attacks on such a high - profile figure eventually led lawmakers across the political divide to rise up in support of @entity16 -- but they have also led to a great deal of soul - searching over the extent of racism in @entity5			1
those who study the question , like historian @entity36 , whose father was from @entity38 , says there is no question racism is growing			2
" racist attacks are on the rise in @entity5 , " says @entity36			1
" and racist slurs that used to be absolutely uncommon are becoming more and more common , if not more accepted , in growing parts of @entity5 society			2
so there is a lot to worry about when looking at the situation			0
" in a country that takes pride and expends considerable energy to ensure that the principle of " egalite " ( equality ) is strictly adhered to , there are some racial references practically embedded in the language and culture here			2
" @entity62 " is the n - word in @entity5 , and it is used in ways that would raise eyebrows elsewhere			1
a " negre , " for example , is a ghostwriter in @entity5 , " @entity68 " is the name for a chocolate pastry , and " petit negre " is the way one refers to poor or pidgin @entity5			2
opinion : is @entity5 racist ? abuse shocks nation but the recent rise of intolerance goes far beyond throwbacks to @entity5 's colonial past			1
at @entity79 , a private company that moderates and deletes racial and other objectionable postings on internet forums , websites and social pages , ceo @entity78 has watched a steadily growing hardening of language			0
part of it , he believes , relates to the increasing license people feel to express on the web sentiments they might hold privately but would never bring up in direct conversation			0
but he also thinks part of it is due to growing racism among his countrymen : when the @entity16 affair came along , @entity78 says he saw a 10 % spike in the number of racial slurs his company had to delete			1
many here link more hostile attitudes toward immigration with the racism issue			0
but the far right @entity15 party is trying to separate the two			0
@entity15 vice president @entity108 , who denies that his party is racist , says : " racism is not growing in @entity5			1
" but in nearly the same breath he states flatly what analysts believe is the party 's major selling point : " we need to end immigration			0
" the @entity15 's anti-immigration platform has at least partly contributed to its growing popularity			0
the party was practically banished from political discourse at one point , but according to one recent poll , 42 % of those questioned said they would consider voting for a @entity15 candidate in the coming municipal elections			0
that news comes at the same time as the attacks on the justice minister -- and other recent incidents where racial slurs were hurled in public ( on @entity5 's football field , for example ) -- have been enough to mobilize mainstream leaders and cultural figures here			1
there have been several rallies against racism and more are planned			0
whether anti-racism demonstrations will be enough to change attitudes in @entity5 in the short term is another matter			2
many like @entity36 believe a significant factor in the growing racism is the poor economy , as people try to find scapegoats responsible for the hard times			0
until the economy improves , it seems doubtful that even widespread public chest - beating over the issue will have much effect			0
opinion : is @entity5 racist ? abuse shocks nation			2

spate of high - profile incidents raise racism fears in @entity5
black justice minister @entity16 *subjected* to monkey taunts *online* and in person
@entity5 proud of notion of " egalite " ( equality ) but experts say racism is on the rise
