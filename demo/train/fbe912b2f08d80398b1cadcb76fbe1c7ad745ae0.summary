-- a federal investigation found that the @entity3 has engaged in patterns of misconduct in violation of the @entity7 and federal law , the @entity1 announced thursday			1
among the findings are that the police department has used excessive force , made unconstitutional stops and searches , and illegally profiled people based on race , ethnicity and sexual orientation			2
the investigation also found a number of practices that contributed to the illegal conduct , including failed systems for recruiting and promoting officers , poor training and lack of supervision , among others			1
" today is both a day for concern and hope , " @entity29 deputy attorney general @entity28 said			0
many of the @entity34 officers carry out their jobs well , he said , but " unfortunately , our conclusions reveal that many @entity34 police officers have failed to live up to what we rightfully expect from our law enforcement people			1
" police superintendent @entity40 said his department is " completely embracing " the report			2
" i believe there is no question that this plan will catapult our department , " he said			2
the investigation was announced last year , when the newly elected mayor , @entity49 , asked the @entity1 to review the city 's embattled police department just two days after taking office			1
in a may 2010 letter sent to attorney general @entity54 , @entity49 asks for a team from the department 's civil rights division to help the city address and prevent police misconduct			0
" i have inherited a police force that has been described by many as one of the worst police departments in the country , " @entity49 said in the letter			0
" it is clear that nothing short of a complete transformation is necessary and essential to ensure safety for the citizens of @entity34 , " it said			0
" the police force , the community , our citizens are desperate for positive change			0
" within his first week in office , @entity49 also announced he had tapped @entity77 -- a @entity34 native who was then police chief in @entity79 and had a track record of reducing violent crime -- as the city 's new police superintendent to lead reforms			0
the investigation was not related to any ongoing federal criminal prosecutions of officers , officials said			1
federal prosecutors have investigated several @entity34 police officers involved in a shooting on the @entity92 four days after @entity93 roared ashore in 2005			1
two civilians were killed in that shooting -- a 19 - year - old man and a severely disabled 40 - year - old man			0
former city police officer @entity99 pleaded guilty in federal court in april 2010 to a charge he failed to report a cover - up of the shooting			0
his plea came after guilty pleas related to the incident from three other former @entity34 police officers : @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110			0
as a result of the findings of the current federal investigation , the @entity1 will work with the @entity34 police to develop new policies and training for its officers			1
the police department must implement a new way of working that ensures accountability , work closer with the community and restore confidence in the department , the @entity1 said			1
" today 's findings should serve as a foundation not only to rebuild the police department but to help restore the community 's trust in fair , just and effective law enforcement , " @entity28 said			1
the investigation was carried out with the support of the mayor and the police superintendent			1
" our investigation has shown that the problems and challenges confronting the @entity3 are serious , wide - ranging , systemic and deeply rooted in the culture of the department , " said @entity135 , assistant attorney general for the @entity136			1
for example , investigators found that officers " regularly used excessive force as retaliation " but that in six years , not one officer - involved shooting violated policy			2
in some cases , there were attempts to prevent the prosecution of officers , @entity135 said			0
they also found that officers did not know the law regarding legal stops , searches and arrests			1
the system at the police department favored quantity of arrests over quality , @entity135 said			0
" our next step will be to work with the ( police ) department to develop a consent decree , which will involve federal oversight , " he said			2
@entity135 said as part of that consent decree , benchmarks will be established to make sure the police department is improving			0
he said the benchmarks will address areas such as racial profiling and use of force			0
investigators also found regular harassment of lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender individuals , he said			0
investigations of city police by the @entity1 are not uncommon , but cities themselves rarely initiate them , @entity186 , executive director of the @entity187 in @entity188 , told @entity0 when the @entity34 probe was launched last year			2
district of @entity197 officials took a similar approach in 1999 when they asked the @entity1 to investigate whether city police were using excessive force , he said .			1

@entity3 is found to be violating constitution and federal law
officers lack proper training and supervision , officials say
many department practices are said to contribute to poor conduct
the @entity1 investigation has support of local leaders
