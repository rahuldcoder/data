another year of magic kicks off thursday morning at the 87th @entity1 , with its signature giant balloons , whimsical floats and performers taking over the streets of @entity6 , but a couple of displays are generating some controversy			1
from its modest beginnings in 1924 , the annual parade has become a holiday tradition featuring some of the world 's most beloved characters and attractions			2
in all , more than 50 balloons -- including @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 from " @entity25 " and @entity26 from " @entity27 " -- and nearly 40 floats will roll down the streets , with new additions from @entity31 , " @entity32 , " @entity18 , @entity19 , and @entity20 -- whose float is being met with protests			1
animal rights activists , including members of @entity36 , say they plan to protest @entity20 's " a @entity40 " float tuesday at the @entity38 location where the floats are built and stored			1
" this planned float is deceptive in the extreme because it shows orcas frolicking in a magnificent sea alongside their families when really we all know now that @entity20 deprives orcas of all these things , " @entity42 , a spokeswoman for @entity36 , told @entity43			1
the documentary " @entity53 , " which recently aired on @entity43 , examines the safety and ethics of keeping killer whales in captivity			0
the film profiled @entity59 , the whale that killed a trainer at @entity20 in 2010			0
@entity36 has released an online petition asking that the @entity20 float be removed from the parade			1
according to @entity66 , more than 80,000 people have already signed it			0
" as far as what happens the day of the parade , it remains to be seen , " @entity66 said			0
@entity36 is also connected to a float controversy involving rocker @entity72			1
@entity72 were scheduled to sing atop a @entity74 tourism float , but the band was removed from the float after protests that @entity72 , a vegetarian and @entity36 advocate , was representing the state where cattle are important to the economy			1
" farming and ranching are primary drivers of @entity74 's economy			2
many livestock producers expressed concern about whether @entity72 was an appropriate representative for an agriculturally oriented state like @entity74 , " @entity85 of the @entity86 told @entity43			2
it is unclear on what float @entity72 will perform thursday			2
" i 've decided to switch from @entity74 to another float because people 's political agendas were getting in the way of what should be a purely entertainment driven event , " @entity72 said in a statement this month			1
" i will remain focused on entertaining the millions of people watching , who will be celebrating a great @entity103 tradition			0
" in the past , @entity104 has avoided controversy at the parade			0
" @entity109 has never taken on , promoted or otherwise engaged in social commentary , political debate , or other forms of advocacy , no matter how worthy , " a spokesperson for @entity104 said in a statement			1
" its mission has always been about entertaining millions of families and spectators			0
" more than 3.5 million people are expected to line the parade route			0
another 50 million are expected to watch more than 1,600 cheerleaders , 11 marching bands and 900 clowns from home			0
@entity124 and @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 are among the scheduled performers			0
despite recent controversies , @entity1 's " will remain steadfast in following the guiding core of a decades old mission , celebration and entertainment for all			2
