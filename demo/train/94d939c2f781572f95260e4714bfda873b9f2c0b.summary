-- @entity1 will be consequential , perhaps a nail biter			0
@entity3 control may turn on a fistful of ballots in key states			1
millions of @entity7 will be reminded again of their ramshackle election system			1
lines are long , registration lists are error - filled , machines break down , and puzzled poll workers offer little help			2
this year , private citizens seeking to stop " voter fraud " could worsen the mess			1
such unofficial and perhaps overheated activism may prove a far worse problem than phony voting itself			2
every citizen has a right to know that ballots are legitimately cast and fairly counted			0
but illegal voting simply is not a widespread problem			1
an epidemic of voter fraud is an urban myth , like alligators living in the sewer			1
fear of imaginary fraud must not be an excuse to block actual voting by real people			1
a recent example of the confusion sown by politically overheated allegations of fraud can be found in the much - ballyhooed charges by @entity41 of voter fraud in 2008 , all of which proved to be false			1
some canvassers were arrested for submitting fake registrations , a practice made worse by state laws requiring private groups to submit all registration applications , even the ones they know might be wrongly filled out			0
but phony voters never showed up to vote			2
one reason : first - time voters must always show @entity54			1
if @entity56 registers to vote , he still must show @entity54			0
( even in @entity59 , where they know him ! ) of course , from our democracy 's earliest days , politicians zestfully have stuffed ballot boxes			2
@entity64 bragged : " so long as i count the votes , what are you going to do about it ? " @entity70 , in his masterful biography , recounted how @entity71 won his @entity3 seat in 1948 when officials " found " a lost box of votes , in which every single voter supported @entity71 -- conveniently in alphabetical order			1
even @entity78 joked about how mayor @entity79 had stolen votes on his behalf			0
when misconduct occurred , it was overwhelmingly by politicians , rarely by rogue individual voters			2
and it is largely a thing of the past			0
far more worrisome is another ominous strain in @entity7 history : ugly efforts to block legitimate voters , often targeting racial minorities			1
future chief justice @entity95 got his start in politics striding up to @entity99 voters and demanding they prove their eligibility			2
in 2004 , partisans planned to challenge voters in @entity103			2
a federal judge who blocked the move found that less than one in five voters in majority white precincts would have had their eligibility questioned , while nearly every voter in @entity111 - @entity7 majority locations would be challenged			1
all of which brings us to today			0
in 2010 , there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud -- none			1
that 's not because nobody was looking			0
the @entity121 administration made vote fraud a top @entity124 priority			2
yet from 2002 to 2005 , federal prosecutors convicted just 17 people nationwide for casting fraudulent ballots			0
recall that it was the failure of prosecutors to move against nonexistent fraud that led to the political purge of @entity7 attorneys in 2006 , a scandal that prompted the resignation of attorney general @entity135			1
yes , many registration lists contain mistakes or wrong names			0
but that is a product of slipshod and inaccurate paper records , not because crooks wrongly sought to vote			0
statistically , an individual is more likely to be hit by lightning than to vote fraudulently			0
yet fear of fraud continues to grip many activists			1
according to a 2009 poll by @entity149 , an astonishing 52 percent of @entity150 believed the now - defunct group @entity151 stole the presidential election for @entity153 in 2008 , even though there 's no evidence that such a theft occurred			1
during its voter registration campaign that year , @entity151 said it signed up 1.3 million voters , a small percentage of which were fraudulent -- an amount that independent analysts said had negligible effect			1
on @entity1 , some conservatives may fan out to polling places , demanding proof of eligibility and generally raising a ruckus			0
the @entity172 @entity150 website describes a plan to post 3,600 challengers at @entity176 - leaning polling places			2
the @entity178 @entity150 candidate for @entity3 brags he will mount the largest " voter integrity program " in 15 years			1
more troubling are new efforts by angry private citizens			0
@entity183 groups have hosted challenger training sessions in at least four states			0
talk show hosts are urging vigilance			0
people can now report voters they deem suspicious with two new @entity191 apps			2
" ballot security " squads manned by angry , under - trained activists at a polling place could easily spawn intimidation or chaos			1
how can we make sure this does n't happen ? @entity183 members and others must take care that monitoring does not cross the line into intimidation			0
law enforcement should make clear what is illegal , including strong presence by local police when appropriate			0
and in the longer run , conservatives and liberals alike should agree on reforms to voter registration so that all eligible citizens are on the rolls permanently , minimizing any possibility of fraud while maximizing participation			1
many states are moving in this direction already			0
when it comes to voting , let 's all agree : vigilance , yes ; vigilantism , never			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity227			1

@entity227 says recent charges of widespread voter fraud turn out to be urban myth
he says ballot box - stuffing in @entity7 is history ; new , real worry is blocking legitimate voters
he says evidence of challenging voters at polls , often minorities , abounds in recent years
@entity227 : voting activists must *prevent* intimidation for political *advantage* at polls
