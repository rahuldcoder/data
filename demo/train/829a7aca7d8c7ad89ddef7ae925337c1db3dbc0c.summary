@entity0 is working on banning internet pornography , calling explicit online images a threat to children			1
' " there is a strong consensus building in @entity0 , " @entity5 , an adviser to the nation 's interior minister , told @entity9 's @entity8			1
" we have so many experts , from educationalists to the police and those who work with children behind this , that this has become much broader than party politics			2
" at the moment , we are looking at the best technical ways to achieve this			2
but surely if we can send a man to the moon , we must be able to tackle porn on the @entity26			0
" such a step is somewhat surprising among @entity29 nations that , for the most part , champion free - speech rights			0
but the move would n't be unprecedented in the island nation			1
@entity0 has had laws banning the printing and distribution of pornography for years , but those laws have n't been updated to include the @entity39			1
and two years ago , the nation 's parliament banned strip clubs , saying they violate the rights of the women who work in them			1
@entity0 would become the first @entity29 democracy to try and block pornography online			1
interior minister @entity48 has appointed committees to study the best methods for keeping young people from seeing explicit images and videos on computers , game consoles and smartphones			0
the options being considered , according to the @entity8 , include blocking the ip addresses of known porn sites and making it illegal to use credit cards from @entity0 to subscribe to x-rated sites			1
" this move is not anti-sex			0
it is anti-violence because young children are seeing porn and acting it out , " @entity5 said			2
" that is where we draw the line			0
this material is blurring the boundaries for young people about what is right and wrong			0
" attempting a total block of porn sites somewhere like the @entity76 , with its legions of public and private portals onto the @entity39 and the millions of software engineers who likely would spring into action to find workarounds , would be nearly impossible			0
but @entity0 has a population of 322,000 -- roughly the same as @entity83 , @entity84			2
that , and its remote location 1,300 miles off of the coast of @entity88 , would make jamming or blocking web traffic to certain sites easier , if that was the route the government there chose			0
the move is , predictably , drawing fire from web - freedom advocates , including some in @entity0 who agree with @entity48 on most issues			2
" since he claimed office as minister , @entity48 has brought forward progressive legislation and has shown that he can be a man of principles and courage			0
for that , i truly respect him , " @entity104 , a member of @entity0 's parliament who represents part of @entity107 , wrote in an editorial for @entity110 's @entity109			1
" but he is way off track in his attempts to place a shield around @entity0 in order to ' stop porn ' from entering the country			1
" a member of the parliament committee studying the issue , @entity104 says a porn ban has " near zero " chance of passing parliament and that she 's working to find other ways the government can help protect children from web porn			1
" introducing censorship without compromising freedom of expression and speech is like trying to mix oil and water : it is impossible , " she wrote			0
" i know my fellow @entity135 can often turn strange and dangerous laws into reality , but this wo n't be one of them			0
