@entity0 -- a lawyer for presidential assailant @entity3 made an impassioned plea to a federal judge thursday to allow @entity3 longer visits to his elderly mother 's home in @entity8			1
" we submit that you ca n't afford to go slow , " @entity9 said			1
" mrs. @entity12 , who is now healthy , can not remain healthy forever			0
" the lawyer said @entity3 needs to spend more time with his 86 - year - old mother , @entity15 , while she 's still able to help him integrate into her community in @entity17 , @entity8			1
@entity9 rejected concerns by government mental health experts that @entity3 is so isolated he has never made any friends in @entity17 while there during releases , that he is deceptive and that he has problematic romantic relationships with women			1
" not once during any one of these releases has mr. @entity3 done anything dangerous or violent			2
not once , " @entity9 said at the conclusion of a multiple - day court hearing on his client 's future			0
" mr. @entity3 is entitled as a matter of constitutional law to be placed in the least restrictive environment consistent with public safety			2
" @entity3 was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the 1981 shooting of president @entity37 , press secretary @entity38 , secret service agent @entity39 , and police officer @entity40			2
for three decades @entity3 has been a patient at @entity41 , a mental hospital in the @entity0			2
currently , @entity3 is allowed 10 - day visits once a month to his widowed mother 's home			1
his hospital has proposed increasing that to two visits of 17 days followed by six visits of 24 days			0
after that , @entity41 would like the authority to decide whether @entity3 could be released on " convalescent leave , " which would make him a permanent outpatient			1
the government opposes the plan			0
prosecutor @entity56 said the hospital and @entity3 's legal team have " not met the burden " to prove @entity3 wo n't be a danger to himself or others if he has more freedom			1
the government wants to keep the visits limited to 10 days at least until there is a more specific plan in place for @entity3 to attend outpatient group , art and music therapy sessions through a @entity17 mental health provider			1
@entity3 already sees a psychiatrist and a case manager during his trips			2
one of the biggest controversies raised during 13 days of hearings was that @entity3 did not always follow hospital - approved itineraries for how he would spend three hours of unaccompanied time allotted to him twice during each visit			2
witnesses testified that in july and september of 2011 @entity3 skipped movies he was permitted to attend and then lied about it			2
in addition , @entity84 agents who were watching @entity3 testified that in july and october last year , @entity3 went to bookstores and looked at shelves of history books , some of which dealt with presidential assassinations			2
the @entity41 proposal to expand @entity3 's freedoms would give him more hours of free time and stop requiring that he adhere to itineraries			1
the government concedes @entity3 's condition has improved through the years , but does not want him to have unsupervised outings at this time			1
@entity56 said if the judge decides to allow more free time without specific itineraries , the government would want him to wear an ankle monitor			2
@entity3 does carry a cell phone equipped with gps , but a subpoena would be needed to access his phone records			0
the government maintains the gps - equipped phone is not a feasible way to keep track of @entity3 in real time anyway			1
testimony during the proceedings revealed the @entity84 watches @entity3 from time to time while he is in @entity17			0
but lawyers said that from august of 2009 until march of 2011 , agents were not doing surveillance while he was going to restaurants , stores , and other activities			0
@entity9 bitterly complained during his closing argument about psychiatrists @entity122 and @entity124 , who testified as government witnesses			0
he said their risk assessments on @entity12 were based on " little more than supercilious swagger			0
" their concerns about @entity3 were the same ones they had raised previously through the years , yet @entity3 had never done anything dangerous , @entity9 said			0
@entity122 and @entity124 voiced concerns about the hospital 's proposal to greatly increase @entity3 's freedom			1
@entity122 , the former director of forensic psychiatry at @entity41 , told the court he opposes allowing any expansion of @entity3 's trips beyond 17 days and said the unaccompanied time should end			1
@entity122 said he interviewed @entity12 and specifically asked him about lying about going to the movies			0
he testified @entity3 said the doctor was " nitpicking			0
" @entity122 and @entity124 both said @entity3 should have kept to his itineraries to prove he could be trusted			0
the doctors also raised concerns about @entity3 's romantic relationships with a series of women he met at @entity41			1
here again @entity3 's truthfulness was called into question with testimony that @entity3 had given different stories to different people about whether he had been engaged to one woman identified only as miss cb			1
it was @entity3 's delusional relationship with actress @entity158 that motivated him to shoot president @entity37			1
@entity3 sat quietly during the multiple days of testimony , but never testified			0
@entity9 would not discuss his client 's views about the hearing but he described him as " resilient			0
" @entity9 said his client had been subjected to " an unfortunate volley of attacks " during the course of the court proceedings			0
@entity170 district judge @entity169 told lawyers for both sides not to expect his ruling before april or may			1
lawyers said it would not be surprising if @entity169 took even more time to weigh all the evidence before making his decision			0
in december , @entity169 indicated he was uncomfortable with the proposal for @entity41 to ultimately decide if @entity3 could become a permanent outpatient			1
instead , the judge said , that authority should rest with him .			0

" you ca n't afford to go slow , " @entity3 's attorney tells the judge
@entity3 is seeking eventual permanent release in the town where his mother lives
the government says it has not been shown he would not be a danger to others
the judge tells the attorneys not to expect a decision before april or may
