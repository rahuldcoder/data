a woman claims in a federal court filing this week that she was forced to have sex with several men -- including @entity6 's prince @entity5 -- while a teenager , an allegation the @entity5 's camp firmly denies			1
a royal family spokesman in @entity11 labeled the accusation against @entity5 " categorically untrue			1
" the woman made the allegation in a civil motion filed tuesday in @entity14 in southern @entity15 , joined by another unnamed woman			0
both are seeking to join two other women who are arguing in federal court for the @entity21 government to take a fresh look at its case involving self - made billionaire @entity24 , who pleaded guilty some years ago in @entity15 to a state charge of prostitution solicitation			1
the investment banker agreed to a state plea deal in 2007 and began serving an 18 - month sentence in 2008 , said @entity30			1
according to @entity31 and the @entity32 , @entity24 was the subject of a federal investigation but a deal allowed him to plead guilty to the lesser state charge and avoid a potential federal case			1
the four women allege their rights under the @entity41 were violated because the @entity21 " government secretly negotiated a non-prosecution agreement " with @entity24			1
according to the new court filing , the women contend they were not properly informed by the government about the ongoing status of a possible federal prosecution			0
it also claims @entity24 used " powerful political and social connections to secure a favorable plea deal			1
" tuesday 's filing claims the two new alleged victims were sexually abused and exploited by @entity24 , one beginning when she was 15 and the other when she was 16			1
one of them , referred to as @entity56 # 3 in the document , claims that an accomplice who @entity24 " used to procure under - aged girls for sexual activities " approached her in 1999			2
that alleged female accomplice allegedly " regularly participated in @entity24 's sexual exploitation of minors " and assisted @entity24 as he made @entity56 # 3 into a " sex slave " from 1999 to 2002 , the filing says			1
the court filing makes claims against others allegedly involved " in @entity24 's sexual abuse ring , " saying , " @entity24 also sexually trafficked the then - minor @entity56 , making her available for sex to politically - connected and financially - powerful people			1
" prince @entity5 was one of those named , with the filing claiming that @entity56 # 3 " was forced to have sexual relations with him when she was a minor " in @entity11 , @entity78 and on @entity24 's private island in the @entity80			1
a palace spokesman , who is not named per custom , pointed out friday that prince @entity5 , the @entity5 , is not a direct party to the " ongoing civil proceedings in the @entity21			1
" @entity5 is a son of @entity84 and a brother of @entity86 , the next in line for the @entity6 throne			2
" as such we would not comment on the detail , " the palace spokesman said			0
" however , for the avoidance of doubt , any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue			0
" also accused in the court filing this week of sexually abusing @entity56 # 3 was noted law professor @entity99			0
" @entity24 required @entity56 # 3 to have sexual relations with @entity99 on numerous occasions while she was a minor , not only in @entity15 but also on private planes , in @entity78 , @entity105 , and the @entity80 , " the filing states			2
@entity99 issued an adamant denial , saying the case " is all about money			0
" " the entire story is completely made up , " @entity99 said in the statement			0
" i have challenged her lawyers for her to repeat these statements in public so that i can sue them for defamation and i have challenged her to file criminal charges against me , because the filing of false criminal charges , which this one is , is a serious crime , " he added			0
a lawyer for @entity24 also dismissed the allegations			2
" these are stale , rehashed allegations that lawyers are now attempting to repackage and spice up by adding the names of prominent people , " said @entity24 's attorney , @entity128			2
" the allegations , which are outlandish on their face and discredited by the evidence , were made in a civil case in which mr. @entity24 is not a party			2
" an attorney for the alleged victims , @entity134 , said that he was " not able to comment beyond our pleadings at this point nor respond to any denials or threats by anyone			0
" through @entity134 ' office , @entity56 # 3 issued a statement saying she is " looking forward to vindicating my rights as an innocent victim and pursuing all available recourse			0
it appears that i am now being unjustly victimized again			0
" @entity0 's @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 contributed to this report .			0
