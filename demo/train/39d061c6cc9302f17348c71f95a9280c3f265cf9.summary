-- fast food and some retail workers in 50 cities around the country are striking today , and have mounted dozens of strikes over the past few months			1
their demands are simple : a pay raise to $ 15 per hour -- roughly double the federal minimum wage -- and union recognition			2
the " @entity12 " movement began in @entity13 last fall and quickly spread to other cities			0
in some places it grew to include workers in other low - wage jobs besides fast food			1
like the earlier @entity22 protests , this new movement has captured the imagination of millions of @entity24 angry about the ever - widening gap between haves and have - nots			1
but unlike @entity22 , with its youthful base and reliance on new social media , @entity12 was born from a marriage of old - fashioned unionism and community organizing			0
its protagonists are ordinary workers , many of them black , brown and / or female			0
they are struggling to support their families on jobs that pay at or close to the legal minimum , with few benefits			0
adding insult to injury , full - time work is hard to find in the fast food and retail world			1
but many workers have no other options , since the @entity50 permanently wiped out millions of better - paying jobs			2
the federal minimum wage dates back to the 1938 @entity54 - part of @entity56 's @entity55			1
but inflation has eaten away at the guarantee it was meant to provide			0
in today 's dollars , the minimum wage is worth less now than it was half a century ago			1
meanwhile , what @entity56 called " organized money " has been on the warpath against another legacy of the @entity55 : organized labor			0
today only 6.6 % of private - sector workers are union members , less than any time since the early 1930s			1
that 's another reason income inequality has soared			1
but the labor movement refuses to die			1
instead it is struggling to reinvent itself			0
fast food forward is backed by the giant @entity75 , which boasts more than 2 million members and is known for its creative organizing tactics			1
back in the 1990s the union 's @entity80 campaign lifted standards in another low - wage sector , winning union contracts that improved pay and benefits and converted part - time building service jobs to full - time ones in cities around the country			1
as organized money has successfully choked off the traditional road to unionism through the system created by the 1935 @entity94 under @entity56 , unions have turned to strategies from the community organizing tradition			0
in the case of the fast food strikes , for example , the union partnered with established community - based groups like @entity103			1
similarly the @entity105 campaign , which led the @entity107 walkouts at the nation 's largest retailer last november , uses community organizing tactics rather than standard unionization methods			2
both @entity12 and our @entity112 rely on strategies and tactics perfected by the " worker center " movement that sprang up starting in the1990s			0
it includes dozens of community - based organizations representing taxi drivers , domestic workers , day laborers , street vendors and others at the bottom of the labor market			2
many of these workers are excluded outright from @entity55 laws like the @entity54 and @entity94 , since technically they are not " employees " but " independent contractors			0
" the worker centers have successfully spotlighted the many abuses such workers suffer , and have helped them organize			0
but as community - based groups with shoestring budgets and tiny staffs , the scale of their work has been severely limited			0
still , some have managed to form national organizations , like the @entity143 and the @entity144			0
one of them the @entity146 , is now formally affiliated with the @entity147 , which has developed other partnerships with worker centers in recent years			0
if old - line labor unions - which despite their declining membership , still have relatively deep pockets and political clout - keep stepping up their support for such efforts , that could be a real game - changer			2
that 's the significance of the fast food walkouts : they could be the embryo of a new labor movement that challenges the power of organized money and the skyrocketing inequality that has made the @entity24 middle class an endangered species			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity169 .			2

@entity169 : fast food and retail workers are walking out to seek better wages
she says movement *resonates* because income inequality is 21st century @entity24 's issue
she says wage *issues* are new front ( with union support ) in a labor movement that has *lagged*
*milkman* : low - wage walkouts could be start of new labor push for *strapped* middle class
