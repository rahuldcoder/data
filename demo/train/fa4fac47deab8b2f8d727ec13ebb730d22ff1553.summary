-- five years after battling and beating breast cancer , " @entity2 " co-anchor @entity1 faces another dangerous health foe			1
" i 've always been a fighter , and with all of your prayers and support , a winner , " @entity1 said in an online message monday			2
@entity1 , 51 , was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome , also called @entity11 , on the same day in april that her show beat out @entity16 's " @entity15 " in the ratings for the first time in nearly 16 years , she said			1
" talk about your highs and lows ! " " then a few weeks ago , during a rather unpleasant procedure to extract bone marrow for testing , i received word that i would interview president @entity24 the next day , " @entity1 said			1
" the combination of landing the biggest interview of my career and having a drill in my back reminds me that @entity30 only gives us what we can handle and that it helps to have a good sense of humor when we run smack into the absurdity of life			0
" @entity11 is " a disease of the blood and bone marrow and was once known as preleukemia , " @entity1 said in her message on the @entity43 website			1
the chart : what is preleukemia or @entity11 ? it can be brought on by chemotherapy and radiation , treatments that @entity1 underwent after her breast cancer diagnosis			1
" sometimes the treatment for cancer can cause other serious medical problems , " she said			0
" my doctors tell me i 'm going to beat this -- and i know it 's true , " @entity1 said			1
while information found online about @entity11 can be " some scary stuff , " @entity1 said her doctors told her it does n't apply to her			1
" they say i 'm younger and fitter than most people who confront this disease and will be cured			2
" her sister , @entity64 , told @entity66 television station @entity65 -- where she is an anchor -- that the @entity43 host " is not going through this journey alone			1
" her family is behind her , she said , and " the best news that we received was that i 'm a match -- a perfect match			1
" " when i got that news , it was like @entity75 times 1,000 , because anyone who knows what it 's like to wait for that kind of news realizes the trauma , " she said			0
" if @entity1 had not found a match within her family , she would have been one of those 6,000 people to be searching for a match			1
" that search is conducted largely through the @entity86 , which maintains a registry of bone - marrow donors			2
@entity64 said her sister is hoping to draw attention to the registry and encourage people to join			0
" it 's very simple to be part of the registry , " she said			0
" i just had a swab , a cheek swab , and they test that and that 's how they determine that			0
" @entity1 said marrow donors " are scarce and particularly for @entity104 - @entity103 women , " she said			1
" i am very fortunate to have a sister who is an excellent match , and this greatly improves my chances for a cure			2
" the announcement , made online and on her @entity43 show , came monday because she is starting chemotherapy treatments in preparation for the transplant , she said			2
she posted a @entity117 message monday afternoon : " just got home from first treatment			0
my family & i are comforted by your prayers , love & support			0
see you in the morn " @entity1 will " miss a day here or there , " but she will continue to work through her treatments , she said			2
" i love what i do , and the people with whom i do it			0
along with my faith , family and friends , all of you at @entity43 give me the motivation and energy to face this challenge			2
" she will " miss a chunk of time " when she has her bone marrow transplant , she said			1
" when i faced breast cancer , your prayers and good wishes sustained me , gave me such hope and played a major role in my recovery , " she said			0
" in facing this new challenge , i ask humbly for more of your prayers and love -- as i will keep you in mine and update you regularly on my condition			0
" @entity1 began contributing to " @entity2 " in 1995 and was promoted to co-anchor in 2005			1
she previously was a sports reporter for @entity157 and television stations in @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161			0
