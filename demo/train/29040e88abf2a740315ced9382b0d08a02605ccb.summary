@entity0 -- workers in @entity5 's shrimp industry suffer regular abuse and sometimes live in what amounts to virtual slavery , a human - rights organization said wednesday			1
the @entity10 report says the global shrimp industry is worth about $ 13 billion annually			1
sexual and physical abuse , debt bondage , child labor and unsafe working conditions are common in @entity16 and @entity18 's shrimp processing factories , the @entity10 said in a 40 - page report			1
the @entity10 describes itself as " an international nonprofit allied organization of the @entity21 established to provide assistance to workers around the world			0
" workers told @entity16 police who raided one factory in september 2006 " that if they made a mistake on the shrimp peeling line , asked for sick leave , or tried to escape , they could expect to be beaten , sexually molested , or publicly tortured , " according to the report			1
the plant , @entity42 , " was more like a fortress than a factory , with 16 - foot - high barbed - wire capped walls , an armed guard force , and an extensive internal closed - circuit television system , " the @entity10 alleged , citing @entity16 police reports			1
" behind the walls , the police found a scene that one report described as ' little short of medieval , ' with hundreds of workers literally trapped inside the compound , living in squalid conditions , forced to work long hours , and subjected to physical , emotional , and sexual intimidation and abuse			1
workers who angered the employer were often ' put to shame ' in front of others by having their hair cut or shaved in patches			0
women and girls were stripped naked and publicly beaten as a form of discipline			0
" the report says the owner of the factory , who was charged with some offenses , received little in the way of punishment			2
" despite widespread worker rights abuses , including child labor and human trafficking , the owner was charged only with employing children under 15 and failing to provide holidays and time off			1
though these charges are serious , they were treated as first - time labor code violations			0
the owner initially only paid a fine of about $ 2,100 and has returned to work			0
" the report , " @entity81 : the @entity85 , " also contains information from interviews with workers in @entity16 and @entity18			2
the labor rights organization did not name the workers , saying they could suffer retaliation from employers if their identities were not protected			0
" in april 2007 , workers at a factory owned by a major @entity16 shrimp processing company spoke with @entity10 partners , alleging hazardous working conditions as well as an intimidating and discriminatory work environment			1
workers complained of forced overtime and nonpayment of wages if production quotas were missed			0
they also claimed regular exposure to harsh chemicals , lack of access to first aid or health care , and poor air and drinking water quality			0
" they additionally alleged that they had unexplained deductions from their pay , that they worked without a written contract , and that native @entity116 and migrant workers were segregated by the use of colorcoded uniforms			0
" @entity121 rep. @entity120 , a @entity123 @entity122 , said she was " deeply disturbed by the findings of this report " at a news conference announcing the study			1
" simply put , this is outrageous			0
it is unacceptable to treat ... people this way			2
" much of the shrimp processed in @entity16 is destined for the @entity121 , the report said			1
" on average , @entity121 eat more than three pounds of shrimp each year ; about 80 percent of that shrimp is imported			2
in 2006 alone , @entity121 shrimp imports were valued at over $ 4 billion , making shrimp the most valuable seafood import into the @entity121			2
roughly one - third of that shrimp came from @entity16			2
... in 2002 , shrimp overtook tuna as the most popular seafood in @entity121 homes and restaurants			1
" the @entity10 tracked shrimp from factories it criticized directly to some of @entity121 's best - known retailers and restaurants , though it did not allege wrongdoing on the part of the @entity121 companies			2
@entity150 , the world 's largest retailer , was among the companies mentioned			0
a spokeswoman for @entity150 said the company was not aware of the allegations until contacted by @entity1 but that it adhered to industry standards			0
" we hold our shrimp suppliers to the highest safety and quality standards -- including maintaining processing plants and packaging facilities that meet or exceed best aquaculture practices ( @entity163 ) standards set by the @entity165			0
although we have not seen the @entity10 's report , we are working with our suppliers to investigate the allegations shared by @entity1 , " @entity166 of @entity167 said in a statement on behalf of @entity150			0
the global shrimp industry is worth about $ 13 billion annually , the report said , making shrimp " the most popular and widely traded seafood in the world			1
" @entity16 is one of the world 's largest shrimp exporters ; @entity18 has a much smaller industry			1
