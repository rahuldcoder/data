adm. @entity12 has been @entity13 chairman , the president 's top military adviser , since october of 2007			1
army gen. @entity15 takes his place			1
" as the new secretary of defense , i am confident of the future because we have the strongest military force in our history -- and it is strong because we can replace one great warrior with another , " @entity17 said during the 90 - minute @entity18 and @entity20 ceremony on the @entity22 parade ground across the river from @entity0			0
. it was n't just the october sun that brightened the day for @entity12			2
it was also the lengthy praise from the president and from the military he had served for 43 years , as well as the day 's latest success in the terrorism fight -- the successful take - down of @entity41 leader @entity40			0
@entity42 pointed to @entity12 's leadership , from all the advice he provided in the @entity45 about the nation 's two wars , to his crucial testimony to @entity49 that the country should end its ban on gays and lesbians serving open in the military			1
" @entity12 , as you look back at your four consequential years as chairman and your four decades in uniform , be assured : our military is stronger and our nation is more secure because of the service that you have rendered			1
" @entity12 , the son of a @entity64 publicist , is a master of self - deprecating humor			2
he drew laughter from the crowd when he told a story of how he had been mistakenly identified at a party as the former general , and now @entity72 director , @entity71			0
and he said that @entity74 meetings went better if participants did n't criticize the president 's baseball team , the @entity76			0
" and he really likes it when you laugh at his jokes			0
it just makes the meeting go better			0
@entity12 never misses a chance to make a point , hammering a favorite theme , that the @entity87 public must become more connected to its military personnel when they come home , giving them a chance , a job , an education			1
" welcome them back to those places , not with bands and bunting or yellow ribbons , but with the solemn recognition that they have done your bidding , they have represented you well , they have carried the best of you and of this country into battle , " @entity12 said			2
" they have done things and seen things and bear things in their souls that you can not know			0
" @entity17 praised @entity12 's hard work and dogged persistence			2

@entity15 becomes @entity17 's and @entity42 's right hand man in navigating the withdrawal from @entity128 and the hard choices about budget cuts			1

" in a speech he gave while leading the @entity140 's @entity139 , @entity15 said that the pace of change in today 's world requires that we look at the future differently than we have in the past			2
instead of trying to leap ahead decades into the future as we design our military , we must build a force able to handle the challenges we know it will face today , and one that can adapt to the future			0
" @entity12 oversaw two wars plus the @entity87 role in the @entity156 conflict during his four - year term			1
but in recent weeks he found himself in a final skirmish inside the @entity42 administration itself over his statements that the extremist @entity161 along the @entity128 border was " a veritable arm " of the @entity165 intelligence service			1
he chose not to comment directly on that , saying only that in his advice to his successor , " i urged @entity15 to remember the importance of @entity165 to all of this , to try and do a better job than i did with that vexing and yet vital relationship			0
" @entity12 said @entity128 will be @entity15 's biggest challenge			1
" in seeing this critical transition through to its completion , in making sure that the security gains we have made are not squandered by the scourge of corruption or the lack of good governance that still plagues the country , our strategy is the right one , " @entity12 said			0
" we must keep executing it			0
" the new chairman , the first army general elevated to chairman since 2001 , had the last word			0
" although you 're a sailor and i 'm a soldier , in the tradition of the horse cavalry , i want you to know that i will be proud to tell people that i rode with @entity12 during some of the most challenging times in our nation 's history			1
