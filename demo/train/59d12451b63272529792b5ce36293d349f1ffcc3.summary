-- @entity1 wooed readers with his romantic poetry , but the latest lines in his story could be ripped from a murder mystery			1
the @entity9 poet 's 1973 death certificate says prostate cancer killed him			1
but his former chauffeur has another theory involving an unknown assassin , a lethal injection and the @entity17 country 's notorious military coup			1
on monday , authorities started putting that theory to the test , exhuming the poet 's remains as part of a high - profile investigation that could take months to complete			1
@entity25 , the chauffeur , said he 's received threats for making the controversial claim , which has riled some of @entity1 's supporters			1
that wo n't stop him from speaking his mind , @entity25 told @entity32			0
" i am not afraid of anyone , " he said			0
chauffeur : ' they silenced him ' @entity1 died on september 23 , 1973 , just 12 days after a right - wing military coup ousted socialist president @entity37 and brought gen. @entity38 to power			1
the poet , a @entity41 member , had criticized the coup and @entity38			2
less than two weeks later , he was dead			0
he had been planning to go into exile the next day -- and the timing of his death was no coincidence , according to @entity25			0
@entity1 was a well known political and public figure , having served as a lawmaker and diplomat in addition to his literary career , which earned him a @entity52 in 1971			2
" i believe that @entity1 was murdered , because @entity1 was a very relevant figure in history , as much in this country as in the world , " @entity25 told @entity32			2
" he was going to go into exile on september 24 and they silenced him before then			0
" thousands of people disappeared or died during @entity38 's rule , and many have accused his government of using death squads to wipe out political opponents			2
@entity25 alleges that @entity1 was poisoned in a clinic where he was undergoing treatment			2
that claim and several other alleged discrepancies surrounding the poet 's death drew the attention of @entity9 's @entity41 , which called for @entity1 to be exhumed in 2011			1
evidence suggests that a third party was involved in @entity1 's death , said @entity41 attorney @entity75			1
@entity9 judge @entity76 ordered the exhumation in february			0
nephew : ' this is a circus ' but not everyone shares the @entity41 's concerns			0
after the exhumation request , the head of the @entity83 -- founded by the poet 's widow to promote and preserve his legacy -- said he did n't want authorities to dig up @entity1 's remains			1
" we are against an exhumation of his cadaver because it would seem to us a true act of desecration , " @entity90 told @entity9 's @entity91 in 2011			0
the organization has since adopted a more welcoming tone			0
" in this year that marks four decades since the death of @entity1 , we hope also that the investigation of judge @entity76 will help clarify the doubts that might exist regarding the poet 's death , " the foundation said in a statement last week			1
" this is a circus that i do not want to be part of , " @entity110 , @entity1 's nephew and biographer , said last week			1
@entity110 said party officials never contacted him to discuss their desire to have @entity1 's remains exhumed , and he told @entity32 that he remains suspicious of their motives			1
as debate surges , @entity110 said he plans to update a biography of @entity1 and publish photographs taken of the poet after his death , which show @entity1 's physical state and the clothes he was wearing in his coffin			1
" it seems that when someone wants to find the truth but ignores all the sides of the story , that is notable , " he said			0
expert : time ' erases evidence ' the investigation into @entity1 's death follows another high - profile exhumation			1
as part of a massive probe of 726 reported human rights violations during @entity38 's rule , @entity9 authorities exhumed @entity37 's body in 2011			0
official accounts ruled the leftist leader 's death a suicide , saying that he shot himself -- with a gun that was reportedly a gift from @entity148 -- as @entity38 's troops closed in on the presidential palace			2
in july 2011 , @entity9 's @entity151 confirmed that suicide was the cause of @entity37 's death for decades , @entity1 has been buried alongside his wife , @entity155 , in @entity156 , a coastal area in central @entity9			1
excavation crews began work there on sunday and completed the exhumation on monday , @entity32 reported			0
determining what really happened will be a difficult task , since so much time has passed since the poet 's death , one pathologist told @entity32			2
" time is a destructive factor , " said dr. @entity167 , an investigator for the office of @entity9 's government ombudsman			0
" it is an element that erases evidence			0
" tissues will have decomposed , he said , and even if some sort of poison were used , there may no longer be any traces remaining			0
" science has enormous limitations in this case , " he said .			0
