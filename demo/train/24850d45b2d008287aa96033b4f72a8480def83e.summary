-- @entity1 is one of @entity3 's biggest stars and the ice skater who won the country 's first figure skating gold medal at a @entity8 last year in @entity9			1
known as " @entity1 " to her legions of fans , the 20 - year old is far from the haughty ice maiden that moniker might suggest			1
she fronts sellout ice dancing shows and has a plethora of advertising deals that cash in on her wholesome image			2
she is also the host of tv show " @entity27 " -- a @entity3 version of " @entity25 " on ice -- that she hopes will popularize the sport in @entity3			1
" when i see those participants enjoying themselves , it is a great joy to me , " she said			0
" although some of them get hurt once in a while , they enjoy it a lot and i hope the show makes the viewers want to give it a try			2
" named by @entity40 as one of the 100 most influential people of 2010 , she has trained as an ice skater since she was 5 , moving to @entity44 at the age of 16 in order to pursue her @entity48 ambitions			1
her work paid off at the @entity50 last year , where she scored a record 228.56 points to win gold in women 's figure skating			2
the highest score since the @entity57 ( @entity57 ) judging system began , she beat her own world record and eclipsed her closest rival , @entity59 of @entity60 , by a massive 23.06 points			0
now having won every " grand slam " title figure skating has to offer , including the @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 , she is one of the highest paid athletes in the world , according to @entity69			0
as well as continuing to skate competitively she 's an ambassador for @entity3 's bid to host the @entity71 in @entity72			1
it 's a responsibility that makes her more nervous than performing at the @entity8			1
" i thought my heart would pop out during the presentation ( in @entity76 , @entity77 )			0
the nervousness was nothing compared to the performances , " she said			0
" until then , i had only taken care of my own business			0
but with this being the wish of many @entity84 , the thought of having that expectation of the whole country on my shoulders , even along with other people , worried and unnerved me			0
" @entity0 spoke to @entity1 at the blush bar of @entity91			2
