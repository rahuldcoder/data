-- it is always important to look back on historical moments in history and remember how it was and reflect on those who made it possible			0
but it is also vital to continue having a forward - looking vision that connects the past with the present			2
when veterans of the civil rights movement and those who were n't even alive in the 1960s pick a date and gather in @entity16 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the @entity18 , a lot will be said about the past			1
rep. @entity20 of @entity21 is the only surviving speaker on the official part of the program , and others who witnessed the speech are older and grayer but still among us			2
it must have been an unbelievable sight to see about 250,000 people before the @entity29 to gather for jobs and freedom for @entity32 on august 28 , 1963			0
we remember the march because of the massive audience as well as the culmination of that day , the riveting speech of the rev. @entity37 , who delivered what is known today as the " @entity40 " speech			1
during that moment in history , the heavy hand of @entity42 was oppressive for @entity32 all across @entity45 but especially for those living under the brutality in the @entity48			0
blacks could n't eat in public places like hotels and restaurants			0
but what the march largely focused on was the economic condition of african - americans			1
when most folks think about the march , too much focus is on the " @entity40 " portion of @entity37 's speech and not the top two - thirds , which was a condemnation of the economic policies that stifled black growth in @entity45			1
" one hundred years later , the life of the @entity67 is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination , " @entity37 said			1
" one hundred years later , the @entity67 lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity			0
one hundred years later , the @entity67 is still languishing in the corners of @entity45 society and finds himself an exile in his own land			0
and so we 've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition			2
" what many people forget is that in the final year of his life , @entity37 was planning the @entity87 , looking to focus the nation on its poorest citizens			1
@entity37 confidant @entity90 told me last year for an interview on my @entity94 show , " @entity93 , " that @entity37 understood that black @entity45 , and all @entity32 , could n't be truly free unless they had economic freedom			1
a lot has changed for black @entity45 since august 28 , 1963 , but when you examine the economic condition in 2013 , we are still facing troubled times			1
as @entity45 has desperately tried to escape the recession that gripped the world over the past few years , black unemployment remains pathetically high			1
overall , the unemployment rate announced in march was 7.7 %			1
for african - americans , it was 13.8 %			2
black teen unemployment was 43.1 %			1
the wealth gap between whites and blacks is even wider today than it has been in three decades			2
according to a recent report ( @entity113 ) released by @entity114 , the wealth gap between whites and black increased from $ 85,000 to $ 236,500 between 1984 and 2009			2
the median net worth of white families is now $ 265,000 , and it 's $ 28,500 for black families			2
the @entity114 study says there are five vital factors for this : number of years owning a home , average family income , college education , employment stability , and financial support from families and inheritance			0
many will read this and say , " oh , please ! get an education , find a good job , work hard , and all will be well			0
" but it 's not as simple as that			0
when you look at the state of education where @entity141 - @entity32 largely live , resources play a crucial role in all of this			0
the lack of a quality education plays a role in what college you 're able to attend , and that will determine what kind of job you will have			0
the long - term racial policies of @entity45 have also played a role			0
the failure of black families being able to go to college for decades in the 20th century , as well as access to good - paying jobs , has played a role in the inability of blacks to pass down wealth from one generation to another			1
all of these factors are why a commemoration of the 1963 march on @entity166 should n't be a big love-fest for folks focused on civil rights			1
it should be singularly focused on driving an agenda that speaks to the unemployment crisis afflicting black @entity45			1
those who are planning events around the march should n't fall into the easy trap of letting any and everyone bring their agenda in august			0
the beauty of the 1963 march is that it was narrow , specific and designed to address a critical need			0
if organizers today want to really walk in the footsteps of those in 1963 , they should go back and study why they all met in the first place			1
the agenda was set in 1963 on jobs and income inequality			0
in 2013 , this generation should pick up that baton and run with it so that the next time there is a commemoration , we will be celebrating how successful we were in addressing and fixing the problem			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			2

@entity199 : the 50th anniversary of the march on @entity16 is coming up
@entity199 : in two - thirds of the " @entity40 " speech , @entity37 focused on economic issues
today , black unemployment is high , and black income levels are low , he says
@entity199 : in commemorating the march , organizers must focus on economic *challenges*
