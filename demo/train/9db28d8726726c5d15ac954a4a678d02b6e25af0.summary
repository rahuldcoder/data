@entity1 militants have brought their hardline version of @entity3 to wide areas of @entity5 and @entity6 , imposing brutal laws and killing people who they deem " unbelievers			1
" their bloodthirsty advances have sent hundreds of thousands of refugees streaming across the borders into neighboring countries , like @entity14 , increasing the risks of instability there			0
but the recent expansion of @entity19 airstrikes against @entity1 into @entity5 , as well as a call by a leader of the extremist group for attacks against @entity25 citizens , has raised questions about how far the militants ' reach extends beyond the @entity29			1
with anti-terrorist raids in @entity32 , the beheading of a @entity35 citizen in @entity36 and reports of @entity1 sympathizers in @entity39 , here 's a look at the countries that could be affected			1
the @entity19 no sign of attacks being planned @entity19 officials have repeatedly said that they have no information to suggest that @entity1 is planning an attack on the @entity19 homeland at the moment			1
but the group recently called on devotees around the world to carry out attacks against people in the @entity19 and other @entity25 countries			1
after the @entity19 and @entity58 partners began airstrikes against @entity1 targets in @entity5 this week , the @entity19 @entity56 issued a bulletin warning law enforcement agencies to be on heightened alert for " lone - wolf " terrorist attacks on @entity19 soil , a @entity19 law enforcement official told @entity67			1
officials said that law enforcement agencies receive similar bulletins on a fairly regular basis as a precaution			0
' @entity74 's playbook ' security analysts say the calls for lone - wolf attacks in the @entity19 are nothing new			1
" it 's taking a page out of @entity74 's playbook , " said @entity78 , a senior vice president at the @entity79 , a security consultancy			1
the @entity19 has in recent years experienced homegrown attacks that were apparently motivated by extremist @entity3 views , including the @entity85 bombings and the @entity87 shootings			1
but a number of attacks in the @entity19 in recent decades were committed by lone wolves -- people with no known link to any terrorist organization -- such as @entity94 , who bombed the federal building in @entity96 in 1995 , or @entity97 , who flew a small plane into an @entity101 , @entity100 office building that housed @entity103 offices in 2010			1
guarding against individuals acting on their own is extremely difficult , experts say , as there are no orders coming down through organizations			0
" almost all the time it 's not there , " @entity110 told @entity67			0
" so that ingredient makes it so much more tough to combat these kind of things and root that out			0
" other group targeted @entity19 authorities are also trying to monitor the more than 100 @entity19 citizens who have traveled to @entity5 to fight for armed groups there , including @entity1			1
the @entity19 who have come to harm at the hands of @entity1 are @entity122 and @entity123 , journalists who were abducted in @entity5 and beheaded by the militant group in recent weeks			1
while @entity19 officials say they have no knowledge of any planned attacks by @entity1 in the @entity19 , they have suggested that @entity129 , a separate terrorist group that was also hit in the airstrikes on @entity5 , was actively plotting against @entity19 and other @entity25 targets			1
the @entity133 the @entity133 @entity135 militant group @entity134 has tweeted what it calls a warning letter to the governments of @entity139 and the @entity133 , threatening to behead one of two @entity139 hostages			0
the group wants a ransom and demands that @entity139 stop supporting the @entity19 - led offensive against @entity1 in @entity6 and @entity5			1
" pay a 250 million pesos ransom ( $ 5.6 million ) to free the hostages and meet the second condition , " the letter says			0
the second condition : " the @entity139 government needs to stop supporting the @entity19 in the killing of our @entity152 brothers in @entity6 and @entity5 , especially ( @entity1 ) militants			1
" " we have warned you			0
delay : 15 days , " the groups says in @entity158 , the language spoken by some @entity133			0
the group sets an october 10 deadline			0
it also posted a photo of the hostage			0
a spokeswoman for the @entity166 told @entity67 , " the @entity139 government has set up a crisis group in the @entity168 to deal with this situation			0
" she declined to be identified because of ministry regulations and would not give any further information			0
@entity32 anti-terrorism raids earlier this month , @entity32 police carried out large - scale raids after investigations suggested suspects were planning " a random attack on individuals			1
" authorities say they have foiled plans to kidnap a member of the public , behead the victim and drape the body in an @entity1 flag			2
one man arrested in the raids was formally charged with conspiracy to commit terrorism			0
prime minister @entity189 suggested that " quite direct exhortations " were coming from an @entity32 citizen overseas who has a " quite senior " role in @entity1			1
days earlier , @entity32 had raised its terror threat level from " medium " to " high			2
" on tuesday , @entity32 police shot dead an 18 - year - old terrorism suspect who had stabbed two police officers at an arranged meeting			1
the teenager had raised concerns after being seen at a shopping mall in recent days with what appeared to be an @entity1 flag , police said			1
new law brought in @entity32 lawmakers voted wednesday to introduce tough new laws that would make it a criminal offense to travel to places where terrorist groups are active			2
civil liberty advocates have criticized the speed at which the new legislation has been brought in , calling for the @entity32 public and members of @entity215 to be given more time to have their say on the legislation			2
@entity32 supports the @entity19 - led campaign of airstrikes against @entity1			1
it has sent warplanes and military personnel to the region			0
@entity35 hostage beheaded in @entity36 @entity1 ' recent call for attacks against @entity25 citizens singled out what it called " the spiteful and filthy @entity35 " for punishment			1
@entity35 planes have taken part in airstrikes against @entity1 positions in @entity6 , but @entity233 says its forces wo n't be involved in bombing raids on @entity5			1
a video posted online wednesday showed the beheading of @entity238 , a @entity35 citizen who was kidnapped in @entity36 over the weekend			1
the video shows armed men who claim to belong to @entity135 militant group @entity241 -- in @entity36			1
they pledge allegiance to @entity1 leader @entity243			1
@entity35 president @entity244 said the attack wo n't affect @entity35 's role in the fight against terrorism			1
" @entity35 will never give in to blackmail , to pressure , to barbaric acts			2
quite to the contrary , @entity35 knows what is expected , " he said			2
concerns about foreign fighters @entity256 , the @entity35 citizen accused of the deadly shooting at @entity259 's @entity258 in may , recently spent a year in @entity5 and is a radicalized @entity135 , according to @entity35 officials			1
prosecutors say that when police arrested @entity256 in @entity35 , they also seized a @entity264 rifle wrapped in a flag bearing the @entity1 insignia			1
@entity19 intelligence officials estimate that more than 2,000 @entity268 have flocked @entity5 to fight with extremist groups there			1
they say it 's unclear precisely how many of them have joined @entity1			2
the @entity272 on wednesday passed a resolution aimed at tackling the threat posed by foreign fighters who seek to join @entity1 and other terrorist organizations			2
@entity277 @entity1 captives @entity277 prime minister @entity279 has said he 's recalling @entity215 on friday to seek approval for the @entity277 to take part in the airstrikes against @entity1 in @entity6			2
" the @entity272 has now received a clear request from the @entity6 government to support it in its military action against @entity1 , " @entity279 said wednesday from @entity272 headquarters in @entity284 , using another term for @entity1			2
" so it is right that @entity277 should move to a new phase of action			0
" @entity1 has already beheaded one of the @entity277 hostages it 's holding , aid worker @entity294			2
it has also threatened the life of another , altruistic taxi driver @entity297 , and used a third , @entity298 , to deliver the group 's message in videos			2
threat level ' severe ' @entity277 authorities announced in late august that they had raised the threat level from international terrorism from " substantial " to " severe			0
" that means that officials judge that a terrorist attack is highly likely but there is no intelligence suggesting that one is imminent			2
" the increase in the threat level is related to developments in @entity5 and @entity6 where terrorist groups are planning attacks against the @entity316 , " home secretary @entity311 said at the time			2
she made no mention of @entity1 in the statement			2
there are also concerns in @entity277 about the possibility of the return of radicalized citizens who have traveled to @entity5 to fight , accentuated by the apparent @entity325 accent of the executioner in the videotaped executions of @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity294			0
@entity277 @entity152 leaders have repeatedly condemned the actions of @entity1			0
" these extremists in @entity6 and @entity5 claim to be acting in the name of @entity3			0
but there is nothing in our faith that condones such behavior , " @entity332 , secretary general of the @entity333 , said after the killing of @entity294			0
@entity39 report sees risk of influence analysts say @entity1 ' high - profile extremism has gained it a small following in @entity39 , the world 's most populous @entity152 nation			1
the support in @entity39 increases the risk of violence there , potentially directed at foreigners , according to the @entity351 , which is based in @entity352			0
" the overall capacity of @entity39 extremists remains low , but their commitment to @entity1 could prove deadly , " said @entity353 , director of the institute			0
the danger is that @entity39 fighting in @entity5 and @entity6 will return home with " the training , combat experience , and leadership potential now lacking in @entity39 's extremist community , " the institute said in a report on @entity1 in @entity39			2
but the report said that many @entity152 in @entity39 have strongly rejected @entity1 ' actions			0
" @entity1 has triggered a bigger backlash than ever seen before in the @entity39 @entity152 community , suggesting that support will stay limited to a fringe of the radical fringe , " it said			0
president calls for broad approach @entity39 president @entity376 on tuesday called for a comprehensive approach to tackling the @entity1 threat , the national news agency @entity375 reported			0
" this is not only the responsibility of the military forces but also the police , diplomats , religious figures and civilians , " @entity376 said in a speech at the @entity380 in @entity380			0
" @entity39 , for instance , has conducted deradicalization programs by engaging religious figures to fight extremism			0
" but the report from the @entity351 warned that @entity39 authorities still have a lot of work to do			0
" it is cause for concern that inmates of high security prisons continue to be among the most active propagators of @entity1 views and teachings , " the report said			0
" @entity39 prison management has improved in recent years , but there is a long way to go			0

@entity19 officials say there is no sign that @entity1 is planning an attack on the @entity19 homeland
analyst : @entity1 ' call for lone - wolf attacks in the @entity19 is a move from " @entity74 's playbook "
