@entity0 -- a @entity3 judge ruled tuesday that state officials can not enforce a new voter identification law in next month 's presidential election			1
the ruling by @entity9 judge @entity8 is expected to be appealed , but amounted to good news for @entity11 who contend the voter id law is motivated by @entity15 efforts to suppress the traditionally @entity11 minority vote			1
" it 's a huge victory in that the photo id requirement for the november election has been blocked and people without @entity13 will be able to vote on regular ballots , " said @entity17 , legal director for the @entity18 in @entity3			1
@entity25 ) supporters argue that the law signed in march by @entity28 gov. @entity28 will prevent voter fraud and is upheld by the @entity30			1
" today 's ruling is a temporary setback , " said @entity31 , director of the @entity33 's @entity32			1
" notably , the court 's ruling accepts the principle that the voter id rules are legal			1
unfortunately , the timing of the change meant that @entity42 will have to wait one more election cycle before they can be sure their elections are fraud - free , " @entity31 said			2
in his ruling , @entity45 granted a preliminary injunction that temporarily halts enforcement of the law until after the november 6 election			1
he cited likely disqualification of eligible voters as the reason			0
" consequently , i am not still convinced in my predictive judgment that there will be no voter disenfranchisement arising out of the commonwealth 's implementation of a voter identification requirement for purposes of the upcoming election , " @entity45 wrote			2
" under these circumstances , i am obliged to enter a preliminary injunction			0
" sisters navigate new @entity3 voter id law however , @entity45 's ruling allows other provisions of the law to stand , including voter education efforts that a photo id is required to cast a ballot			1
election officials also can ask for photo identification , but can not prevent people from voting if they do n't have it			2
the judge wrote that state legislators intended for election officials to request a photo id during the transition period for the new law " even though the vote will be counted regardless of compliance with the request			1
" " the concern is that the @entity9 's education efforts all tell people that they need @entity13 and if that kind of misleading message goes out , it will promote confusion on @entity92 and discourage folks without @entity13 from voting , " said @entity17			0
@entity45 's ruling means the full voter id law could be enforced starting next year			1
his ruling said he will schedule a further hearing on whether to issue a permanent injunction			0
prior to the new law , first - time voters in @entity3 were allowed to present documents like bank statements and utility bills in lieu of photo identification			1
under the new law , all voters would have to present a valid photo id -- one that is sanctioned by the state -- before they cast their ballots			1
to get a photo id , residents must have a valid social security card ; an official birth certificate or @entity116 citizenship documents ; and two proofs of residency , such as a utility bill or tax records			0
new voting measures could deter @entity123 , civil rights group says polls show president @entity125 leading @entity15 challenger @entity126 in @entity3 , which has 20 electoral votes			0
critics say the new law is an attempt by @entity15 -- who overwhelmingly support the measure -- to gain the advantage in a close election			2
@entity28 said the law " sets a simple and clear standard to protect the integrity of our elections			0
" however , lawyers on both sides admit there are no known cases of in - person voter fraud			0
civil rights organizations and attorneys filed a lawsuit in may to overturn the new law			0
the case made its way to the @entity148 , which sent the dispute back to @entity45 in the @entity9			0
@entity150 oks @entity152 voter id law @entity3 is one of 31 states with some form of voter id measure in place			2
most have provisional voting mechanisms for people lacking the proper identification at the polling place			0
four of the states -- @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 -- require a photo id to cast a regular ballot			2
the @entity116 @entity148 upheld @entity166 's law in 2008			0
