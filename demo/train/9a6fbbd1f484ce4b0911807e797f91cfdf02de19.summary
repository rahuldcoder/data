-- if you 're dreaming of a @entity2 -- much like the one @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 used to know at the @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 -- the humbug of the matter is : neither the inn nor the town exist			2
you better not pout , though			0
there are still a few of the season 's favorite film locales that you can visit in real life : the @entity22 family 's house in " @entity23 " if you find yourself in the vicinity of @entity25 and a fanatic of the 1983 cult holiday classic " @entity23 , " make a pit stop at the @entity22 family 's house , which is open for public tours complete with a museum and gift shop directly across the street			1
if fawning over the " i - ca n't - put - my - arms - down " snowsuit and the " oh fuuuuuudge ! " family @entity38 is n't quite enough movie magic , visitors can buy leg lamps at the gift shop for their very own " soft glow of electric sex gleaming in the window			0
" or if you 're feeling extra rebellious , @entity46 , carbine action , 200 - shot range model air rifles are also available			0
@entity48 from " @entity48 " the town of @entity48 in the 1946 classic " it 's a @entity50 " may have been fictional and created on soundstages for filming in @entity54 , @entity55 , but the folks in @entity57 , @entity58 , claim their tiny mill town was director @entity61 's inspiration for the cinematic community			1
( he is believed to have visited the town in 1945			2
) visitors are encouraged to celebrate the film 's ties each december by taking part in a movie - themed walking tour and judging the similarities for themselves			2
stand on the steel @entity72 , similar to the one that @entity75 's character , @entity74 , leapt from in the movie to " save " his guardian angel , @entity78 , or stroll down the streetlamp - lined main street			0
if you feel like making a weekend in @entity58 's @entity81 , opt to stay in one of the 48 rooms in the newly opened @entity84 , named after @entity74 's guardian angel			1
the @entity87 residence from " @entity88 " while you ca n't go through all @entity90 's private stuff ( or inside the house for that matter , unless you 're in the market for a new home ) , you can do a drive - by like your favorite @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 , of the @entity87 residence approximately 15 miles north of downtown @entity100 in the @entity102 suburb			2
the home , built in the 1920s , is listed for sale at $ 1,950,000 , and still features the recognizable staircase just inside the front door in case indoor sledding is one of your favorite pastimes			0
serendipity restaurant from " @entity113 " part holiday movie , part romantic comedy , this 2001 film starring @entity115 and @entity116 opens during the peak of the holiday shopping rush with the then - strangers attempting to buy the last pair of black cashmere gloves at @entity124			1
after initial sparks , the smitten characters , both in relationships , spend the rest of the evening together in @entity58			2
the title of the movie itself is equal parts definition of serendipity -- @entity134 lists it as " the faculty or phenomenon of finding valuable or agreeable things not sought for " -- and the @entity58 restaurant where the two fated lovers partake in frozen hot chocolate and eventually part ways ( only to be reunited by a series of fortunate accidents by the end of the film )			1
if you 've got a sweet tooth and an even sweeter romantic side , the cafe , @entity113 , is open until midnight sunday through thursday , 1 a.m. on fridays and 2 a.m. on saturdays			1
after all , you never know who you may be waiting with in the line that stretches down @entity153			0
@entity154 's from " @entity155 " the actual miracle on 34th street in the 1947 movie , as well as the 1994 remake , takes place at 151 west 34th street to be exact , @entity154 's flagship store in @entity58 's @entity161			1
since 1924 , the department store kicks off the @entity2 shopping season with its annual @entity164 , culminating with the arrival of @entity166 at the parade 's finale			0
after the parade and until @entity171 , children can visit the " nice man with the white beard " like @entity175 and tell @entity166 what they 'd like for @entity2			0
if you ca n't make it to @entity58 , every @entity154 's across the country has a letterbox for stamped letters to the @entity181			1
as a bonus , each letter received will generate a $ 1 donation to the @entity185 .			0
