-- by now the story has become familiar , though it 's no less gut - wrenching : a grown man is accused of hurling a racial insult at a crying toddler on an @entity6 - bound flight and then slapping the child when he wo n't quiet down			1
@entity8 of @entity9 has been charged with assaulting 19 - month - old @entity10 and has lost his job			1
@entity8 turned himself in to authorities on tuesday and was released on bail			1
his first court appearance has not been set			2
@entity8 's attorney , @entity15 , said her client is being unfairly portrayed			1
a good deal of the conversation surrounding the incident involves the fear that the youngster may be " traumatized forever			1
" how likely is it that little @entity10 will remember this incident or be affected by it long - term ? not very likely , according to experts			1
" he may remember it for a while , and he may be fearful , but a one - time experience wo n't have a long - term effect , " said @entity6 pediatrician dr. @entity26			1
according to @entity26 , who has not treated the toddler , @entity10 is too young to understand what is going on			1
the incident was shocking in the moment , says @entity26			1
the toddler understands the slap and knows that someone hit him and that it hurt			0
but he does n't know or comprehend the significance of what happened			0
nor would he understand the meaning if ugly words were directed at him			0
dr. @entity43 , clinical professor of psychiatry at the @entity45 and author of the study " @entity48 in @entity49 , " agrees			0
" i would not say it will cause lifelong trauma , depending on how it 's handled , " observed @entity43 , who is a national expert on preschool trauma			0
the experience may , however , create a vulnerability for a period of time , perhaps months or up to a year or so			1
if something else happens that is reminiscent -- such as being subject to racially charged slurs and violence similar to the alleged incident -- he may be more vulnerable			1
early childhood trauma is certainly a cause for concern			0
dr. @entity68 , director of the @entity69 , told me last year that stressful experiences can effectively rewire the brain to respond to hardship by becoming more sensitized to stress			0
that is , the child becomes hard - wired to react much more strongly than someone who did not experience a lot of turmoil			1
as a result , the child may go on to have a permanently elevated level of stress , with its adverse implications for physical and psychological health			2
but challenging situations , even one as dramatic as the one little @entity10 experienced , do not necessarily lead to lifelong issues			1
@entity68 observed that it 's stress that is sustained , uncontrollable and overwhelming that is damaging			0
" it is hard to be resilient that often , " said @entity43 , who also has not examined @entity10			1
but even then , protective factors like social and family support , education and optimism and emotional self - regulation can provide a safety net for children			2
both @entity26 and @entity43 observe that most children can work through and overcome a single traumatic episode without any obvious long - term effects , given supportive parenting and caretaking			1
" how secure is the child 's relationship with his caregivers ? " @entity26 asked			2
if he 's had good relationships and solid attachments , that will make him more able to deal with traumatic situations like this			0
on the other hand , if he 's had a lot of stress in his life already , it may make it harder			0
what 's really important is how @entity10 's family is dealing with the incident			1
@entity26 says that if the family is calm and reassuring , the child will be comforted by that			2
if they are stressed out and expressing their anxieties , particularly within the toddler 's earshot , he is likely to respond by becoming stressed as well			0
after traumatic incidents , @entity43 always recommends that caregivers look out for subtle signs that children may be adversely affected : " things like increased clinginess , bed - wetting or separation anxiety			2
he may need to be closer to his parents			0
he may have trouble sleeping , may be more hyper			0
noises may make him fearful			0
" the child may even hit others , cautions @entity43			2
and in such an instance , it 's important that parents do not react punitively or generalize in terms of their child being more aggressive			2
" what he 's doing is imitating and reenacting what he experienced , in an attempt to understand it			0
" @entity43 suggest that play therapy may be useful			0
caregivers can use dolls , play materials and toy airplanes to create a scene that helps the child to conceptualize and develop a narrative around what happened			2
over and above providing reassurance and empathy , caregivers need to help children understand that the experience was unique , " so they 're not living with this undercurrent of anxiety that no matter where i am , suddenly , for reasons i do n't understand , something terrible can happen , and someone can come along and hurt me			0
" it 's important to make the unconscious conscious , within the bounds of children 's understanding , says @entity43			0
at age 2 , a child does not understand what happened , but with the wisdom , care and support of his loved ones , over time , he will .			1
