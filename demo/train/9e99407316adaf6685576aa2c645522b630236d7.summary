-- it 's been 25 years since i last heard my mother 's voice			1
@entity5 was home in @entity7 , fretting about the ingredients for her jambalaya , preparing a big tossed green salad			1
i 'll never forget her			2
the look she would give me simply to shut up , or how she raised her hand , signaling it was time to stop playing around			2
the sound of her small feet walking toward the back of the house , then her waking us up in the order of our birth : @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28			2
when she called , we had to start moving			2
my mom passed away when i was in my 20s , but she 's still with me today			1
how could i forget her , when every day i 'm reminded of her loving spirit , her decency , her humor , her optimism , her generous spirit -- and those rules ? my mom was born and died at @entity37 in @entity7			1
appropriate -- because she was a living embodiment of charity			1
despite having nine children , my mother always had some spare food or clothing or -- whatever -- for any child in the neighborhood in need			1
she taught us how to share , how not to waste anything , how to think about others who had even less than we did			2
that 's why i have to think constantly of ways to give back			2
she was a friend and confidante to everyone , and a keeper of secrets			2
i do n't think she knew how to complain			2
@entity5 wanted everybody to be happy			1
( my oldest sister , @entity20 , started calling her " @entity5 , " and it stuck			1
) one weekend , i came home from college and told my mom about a roommate who had a difficult time going back home to rural @entity65			1
@entity5 said to invite her to our house			1
i asked where would she sleep , and my mom answered with her big smile , " there 's enough room for everyone if they just scoot over and make space for others			1
" @entity5 made room for others			1
she came from a family of seven , and my dad , @entity78 , was from a family of 12			2
everyone was welcome , anytime -- but they had to bring their own beer			1
( the @entity83 , behind the train tracks on the corner , was open late			2
@entity5 cooked like she lived -- with largesse			1
red beans and rice with smoke sausage and @entity92 bread			0
a large green tossed salad with dressing , stirred with pickles			0
for dessert , bread pudding made with leftover bread , cane sugar , butter , cinnamon and raisins			0
after our meals and once we removed the throw rugs and put the furniture against the wall , we had a dance floor			0
my brother @entity111 and i did the @entity110 moves ; our cousin @entity113 did the funky chicken better than anyone on the block			0
the older kids showed off their fancy footwork , doing the @entity119 or @entity120			0
soon the adults took over			0
that 's when i learned how to really dance			1
@entity5 told us , " straighten up your backs , never bend over			1
raise up your arms like a bird in the sky and sway those hips from side to side			0
" after a while , i realized my @entity133 was also getting us to work off some of the good food			0
my mom led by example : step up , speak up , be dignified , be respectful -- and be tolerant of others			1
her rules have sustained me , guided me and inspired me			1
i share them with my nieces and nephews -- many of them never met their @entity144 , as @entity145 , her oldest grandchild , referred to her			2
here are 10 of @entity5 's rules : 1			1
do n't you ever talk back to grown folks			0
if you make a mess , clean it up			0
do n't expect others to do for you what you 're not willing to do for yourself			0
get up and go to work			0
if you want it bad enough , earn it			0
if you have something to give , then go ahead and share it			0
never go to a party before eating at home			0
you 'll regret it later			0
if you lie , you steal			0
if you steal , you kill			0
so always tell the truth			0
and if you 're wrong , ask for forgiveness			0
nobody has all the answers , so if you get lost , ask for help			0
i last talked with @entity5 the day before her death			1
she was n't feeling well			0
my sister @entity21 told her to take the day off from work			0
a day later , @entity5 went to the emergency room and never came home again			1
my mom was -- is -- unique			1
is n't yours ? to honor @entity5 's spirit on @entity179 , i will cook a delicious cajun or @entity182 meal			1
i hope you 're doing something special to honor your mom			2
so , in appreciation to all the mothers out there , the soon - to - be moms , the @entity188 ( @entity189 ) and those who embrace motherhood at some level , thank you			0
thank you , @entity5 ! join us on @entity195 / @entity194 .			1
