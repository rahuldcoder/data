@entity0 , @entity1 -- on a cool january morning , @entity1 ambulances sped to the site of a simulated terrorist attack in @entity0 , the country 's largest port city			1
in keeping with the script for the long - planned civil defense exercise , emergency workers responded to a suicide car bomb with one element the country has not experienced in the dozens of real terrorist bombings over the years : this simulated attack dispersed nuclear materials , a " dirty bomb " laced with radioactive @entity17			1
while life went on around them in an otherwise normal day , paramedics rushed the " victims " to area hospitals , where doctors and nurses in protective gear moved to decontaminate and treat their injuries			0
elsewhere , authorities assessed the public health effects and the psychological impact on the public of hearing the words " nuclear " and " bomb " used in the same sentence referring to an attack close to home			2
it was not a simulation of an atomic bomb , but of a " radiological dispersal device , " a much less destructive conventional weapon with some nuclear materials in the mix -- enough to spread a small amount of radiation and a great deal of panic			2
nobody talked about @entity48 during the event			2
but , as with so much of what goes on in @entity1 these days , thoughts of how the conflict over @entity48 's nuclear program might ultimately unfold lurked in people 's minds			1
for all those involved in the exercise , it was an opportunity to prepare for another one of the many disturbing scenarios that come up whenever @entity1 ponder what the future may bring			1
dr. @entity62 , one of the organizers from the @entity64 , called it " a hypothetical but plausible scenario			0
" when word came out months ago that the @entity1 military was preparing the exercise code - named " @entity70 " -- the first ever drill for nuclear terrorism in the country -- authorities tried to downplay its significance			2
perhaps that 's why @entity70 received so little media attention			0
but defense minister @entity77 has often said that the greatest risk from @entity48 's nuclear program is not that @entity79 will launch an atomic bomb against @entity1 , but that it might send a dirty bomb to explode through cargo arriving at a crowded port			1
after years of worrying about @entity48 -- and about other threats in the neighborhood -- @entity1 have developed a cool and tense fatalistic attitude			1
conversations with every day people show a mix of resignation , bravado , fear and a suspicion that there may not be good options			0
in @entity96 , @entity95 , a 57 - year - old salesman , says he does n't think @entity1 will attack @entity48 , but concedes that the uncertainty of what might happen has made him and his friends nervous			1
" everybody 's a little afraid , " he admits			0
others , like @entity102 , are less pessimistic			0
" i count on the government to do the right thing , " she says , adding that she believes @entity104 and the @entity105 understand just how risky a nuclear - armed @entity48 would be for the entire @entity106 and the rest of the world			2
polls show the public is divided about whether or not @entity1 should attack @entity48 to keep nuclear weapons out of its hands			1
given that @entity48 's leaders have openly proclaimed their wish to see @entity1 destroyed , most @entity1 believe a war will happen			1
some @entity1 tellingly confess they have restocked their bomb shelters with fresh water and other supplies			2
the january 18 radiological drill barely made the news in a country where national exercises to prepare for conventional missile attacks , in addition to biological and chemical weapons , have become routine in recent years			2
the need to prepare more actively became clear after the 2006 war with @entity131 's @entity130 , when @entity130 's rockets -- many of them made in @entity48 -- hit a greater portion of @entity1 than ever before , forcing more than 300,000 @entity1 to evacuate their hometowns and sending about a million of them into bomb shelters			1
@entity131 was also affected : at least a million people were displaced during the 34 days of fighting			0
if the conflict with @entity48 does escalate into open warfare , the widespread expectation is that @entity130 , a close ally of @entity48 , will attack @entity1 from @entity131 , while @entity143 , another friend of @entity79 , will do the same from @entity146			1
the @entity105 believes @entity130 alone has an arsenal of about 50,000 rockets and missiles , some capable of reaching practically all of @entity1			0
while the radiological drill did not garner a lot of attention , there was another exercise -- one that did not happen -- which made large headlines			0
the @entity105 and @entity1 has been preparing to hold their largest joint military maneuvers in the history of their alliance , a missile defense drill code - named " @entity164 12 , " in april			0
as military officials on both sides were busy arranging for thousands of @entity105 soldiers to deploy to @entity1 , word came out that the war games had been postponed			0
the circumstances behind the sudden change of plans remain something of a mystery , with officials offering reassurances that there is no reason for concern			0
for @entity1 , however , one of the greatest fears is that they will be abandoned to face @entity48 without international support			1
it came as some comfort that president @entity184 just told @entity185 that he " will take every step available to prevent @entity48 from obtaining a nuclear weapon			1
" @entity1 hope that will be achieved without the need for war , but they believe it is a near certainty that a military operation against @entity48 would result in attacks against @entity1 by @entity48 's allies			1
just in case , they are preparing for any conceivable scenario while carrying on with their daily lives and hoping for the best			0
