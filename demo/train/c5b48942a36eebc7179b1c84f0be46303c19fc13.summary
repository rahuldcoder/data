-- to convincingly yell " i am @entity4 ! " in his new action movie , @entity2 " @entity1 had to do more than warm up his vocal chords			1
as a former pro wrestler , @entity1 was already approaching @entity9 demigod territory in terms of build , but even he had to change his diet and exercise to become mythologically ripped			0
according to @entity14 , the 42 - year - old actor had to endure a " @entity4 diet " that consisted of seven meals a day , extremely heavy on protein			1
the @entity1 would start with a hearty breakfast of four egg whites , five ounces of oatmeal and a 10 - ounce filet of steak			0
by meal no. 3 , he 'd have wolfed down another eight ounces of chicken breast ; eight ounces of halibut ; two cups of white rice and two cups of a green vegetable , like broccoli or asparagus			0
meals four through six were essentially more of the same , with a few baked potatoes thrown in instead of rice			2
it sounds like a lot -- and that would be because it is -- but @entity1 told @entity14 the diet was pretty painless			0
" the only tough one was the last meal of the day , no. 7 , " he said , referring to the nightcap of 10 egg whites scrambled with vegetables , plus 30 grams casein protein			2
" i get back to the hotel room , i 'm ready to go to sleep			0
but i have to down 10 egg whites			0
" but it sounds like eating those eggs was like downing cake compared to the workout portion of his @entity4 training plan			1
" it was grueling , " @entity56 told @entity0 of his training plan at the " @entity4 " premiere in @entity59 on wednesday			1
" it was for six months , and then it was for an additional six months once i got ( on set ) , " the actor said			0
" so it was the most challenging role that i had ever taken on -- physically and mentally , but i 'm happy to be here and i 'm happy to know the movie 's good			1
" the @entity1 's not just hyping his project			0
according to @entity70 , " @entity4 " was 70 % fresh as of july 24			1
directed by @entity72 , the movie follows @entity4 into war as he tries to protect the @entity74			2
also starring @entity75 and @entity76 , " @entity4 " opens friday			2
comic - con : @entity79 's ' @entity78 ' makes an appearance more ' @entity81 ' ? sounds good to me , @entity82 says @entity56 maybe just revealed he 's playing a superhero @entity0 's @entity85 contributed to this report .			1
