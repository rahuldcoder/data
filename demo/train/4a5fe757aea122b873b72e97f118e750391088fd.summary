-- it 's every flier 's worst nightmare : your pilot announces , " we 're all going down ! " and starts shouting about bombs and terrorists			0
he abandons the cockpit , frantically running up and down the aisles like a man unhinged			0
what do you do ? that 's what passengers on a @entity15 flight had to decide tuesday when their pilot , capt. @entity17 , seemed to have a meltdown in the air between @entity20 and @entity21			1
fortunately for everyone on board , a quick - thinking co-pilot and some alert passengers snapped into action			1
initial reports suggest that at least four passengers leapt to their feet and subdued the pilot , who had been trying to break down the cockpit door after his co-pilot locked him out			2
the heroic passengers have been praised for their bravery , and rightly so : they may have saved 141 lives on the plane , and maybe more on the ground			2
it 's hard to hear this story and not admire their swift and effective action -- and wonder how you 'd respond in the same situation			1
would you jump up and subdue a hysterical pilot or sit paralyzed in your seat ? hundreds of studies have explored the so - called " bystander effect , " trying to determine why some observers respond positively to a crisis while others ignore it			1
the research points to a somewhat surprising conclusion : generally speaking , only subtle differences separate the bystanders from the heroes			2
most of us , it seems , can fall into either category depending on the details of a situation			2
the @entity15 crisis highlights some of the factors that can make a difference , suggesting how we can get people -- ourselves included -- to take action in an emergency			1
it might seem obvious that when confronted with a raving man attacking a cockpit door , people would realize they should do something to stop him			0
but that 's not always the case , especially when they 're part of a large crowd			0
in fact , in one famous study , social psychologists @entity78 and @entity80 left people alone in a room and pumped in smoke -- a pretty clear warning sign of danger , maybe on par with a 250 - pound guy in a pilot 's uniform shouting incoherently about @entity92 and @entity93			1
when people were alone in the room , they left and reported the smoke to someone else 75 % of the time			0
but when there were three people in the room , they reported the smoke 38 % of the time , illustrating the problem psychologists call " pluralistic ignorance , " where we mistake other people 's inaction as a sign that everything 's actually ok			0
after all , no one wants to be the fool who tackles your plane 's pilot because you misread the situation -- maybe he was just playing a practical joke ? when we do n't see anyone else respond , we tend to assume there is n't really a crisis ; as a result , we inadvertently hold each other back			1
but response rates shoot up dramatically when one bystander simply acknowledges to another that there might be a problem			0
so on the @entity15 flight , it helped tremendously that the co-pilot and a flight attendant had the presence of mind to use the public address system to call on the passengers to restrain the pilot			1
it becomes nearly impossible to assume there is n't really a problem when your acting captain says there is			1
yet even once we recognize there 's a problem , in crowds we often fall prey to what 's called a " diffusion of responsibility , " where we assume the people around us are going to help , so there 's less of a need for us to take action ourselves			1
research by @entity78 and others shows that the greater the number of people who witness a crisis , the lower the odds that any of them will do anything			1
to overcome this , it helps when we 're singled out personally			0
@entity78 once told me that if you ever sprain your ankle in public , do n't just call for help -- pick out someone in the crowd and say , " hey , you there , can you give me a hand ? " on the @entity15 flight , it seems like the crew only made a blanket appeal to the passengers for help , which probably was n't as effective as it could have been			1
only four passengers out of nearly 150 sprang to action -- responsibility still might have been pretty diffused			2
but it likely helped that several of the plane 's passengers were retired or off - duty law enforcement on their way to a security convention in @entity21			1
@entity78 's research has found that personality does n't necessarily predict whether someone will help			2
what 's more important is whether bystanders have the experience to recognize a crisis when it 's unfolding and feel like they have the skills to do something about it			0
so it probably should come as no surprise that among those who sprang to action , one was a former prison guard and another was an ex-new @entity20 police sergeant with 22 years of experience on the force			0
that sergeant , @entity206 , told @entity207 that when he saw the pilot running amok , " my training immediately kicked in			0
" he said he believed he was " deranged " when he looked into his eyes because he had " dealt with a lot of emotionally disturbed people during my time on the force			0
" people who have experience in law enforcement or the military are probably better at recognizing a crisis because they 're less likely to convince themselves that this could n't be happening to them , could it ? of course , " pluralistic ignorance " might be harder for any of us to maintain on a plane after 9/11 , even 10 years later			1
it 's harder today to rule out the plausibility of any crisis			0
indeed , @entity206 said he immediately thought of that day when he saw @entity17 storming the cockpit			0
" not again , " he told himself , " not while i 'm on this plane			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity234 .			2

@entity234 calls quick action of @entity15 passengers with captain admirable
he says " no way out " situation inhibited " bystander effect , " where people do n't react
he says research shows people usually hang back , rely on others to act on danger
marsh : crew asking for help made a difference , as did law enforcement passengers
