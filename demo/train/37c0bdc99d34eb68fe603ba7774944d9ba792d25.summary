" in the same way you can turn on device notifications so you never miss a tweet from your favorite users , you can now mute users you 'd like to hear from less , " @entity9 said in a blog post late monday			1
the mute function will be available on @entity9 's @entity29 and @entity30 apps and its website and will roll out to all @entity9 users " in the coming weeks			1

muted users you follow can still send you a direct message			2
but the muted user wo n't know you 've muzzled them , and you can unmute them at any time			1
