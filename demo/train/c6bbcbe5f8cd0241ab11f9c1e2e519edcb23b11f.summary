-- after the @entity3 shootings during a showing of " @entity5 , " @entity1 swiftly withdrew the trailer of " @entity7 " from before the @entity9 film and reportedly removed a sequence in which gangsters shoot up a movie theater from behind the screen			1
now " @entity7 " emerges just a month after the @entity15 killings , a titillating but anodyne piece of gun glamour for the masses			2
inspired by @entity21 's series for the @entity22 , " tales from the @entity7 , " the movie ducks the obvious comparisons with " @entity25 , " " @entity26 " and " @entity27 " by opting for a pulpy vibe and poppy , comic book visuals			1
this is no " @entity34 " exercise in history as neo-noir , and it 's sure no @entity36 - style take down of the @entity37 ( the controversial 1950s police chief @entity38 -- played by @entity39 - gets a free pass for instigating what amounts to a vigilante hit - squad operating beyond any legal jurisdiction )			2
rather it 's a gleaming , glossy parade of good - looking actors trading quips and striking poses in sexy period duds , only a couple of stops more naturalistic than " @entity52 " or " @entity53			2
" and it 's @entity55 's film that comes to mind most immediately , with @entity56 channeling a snarling @entity57 ( and showing off a striking prosthetic nose ) as ambitious @entity60 racketeer @entity59 , an all purpose bad guy who orders a @entity63 rival to be chained to two autos and ripped in half in the film 's first minute			1
within another 60 seconds @entity68 's square - jawed sgt. @entity67 has established his impeccable heroic credentials by crashing one of @entity59 's brothels , shooting or beating up five of his henchmen and rescuing an innocent dame from a fate worse than death -- all to the consternation of his immediate superiors , but impressing the heck out of @entity79			1
" do n't make arrests , " @entity38 growls			0
" this is occupied territory			0
" for a spell the movie corrects to an engagingly fizzy tone			0
@entity67 's shrewd and pregnant wife ( the excellent @entity86 ) handpicks his squad			2
there 's a sharpshooter nicknamed " cowboy " she read about in true detective magazine ( @entity92 ) ; a brainiac who knows how to set up a wiretap ( @entity96 )			0
anachronistically , for @entity38 's @entity37 , there 's also an @entity98 who is handy with a knife ( @entity101 ) and a latino who muscles in on the action ( @entity106 )			0
their first intervention is deliciously botched			0
and then they 're faced with getting out of @entity110 alive			0
for all its historical liberties , the movie does have fun re-creating mid-century @entity60			0
last to sign up is @entity115 's sgt. @entity114 , an easygoing womanizer who happens to be sleeping with @entity59 's girl ( @entity117 doing a very passable @entity118 ) , and whose less rigid approach to the job is meant to color our admiration for @entity67 's righteousness			1
but the more seriously " @entity126 " director @entity125 takes the material , the more vapid it comes off			0
some glaring gaps in third act story logic do n't help , but the whole @entity132 and @entity68 dynamic never really snaps into place			1
are they old war buddies ? you can believe @entity68 has seen some action , but @entity115 just comes off as wet behind the ears -- there 's no rapport between them , and no real reason to care when things go sour			1
" @entity7 " looks the part , but it 's so superficial it practically evaporates before our eyes .			1

@entity68 , @entity56 , @entity115 and @entity117 star in " @entity7 "
the film is inspired by @entity21 's series for the @entity22
*critic* says @entity68 , @entity115 buddy dynamic never snaps into place
