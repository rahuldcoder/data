-- i was lying in bed on a recent night when i heard a familiar rustle from my son 's room			1
i knew the routine -- the quiet whimper would soon become a wail for @entity9 or @entity10			1
pick @entity10 tonight , i thought			1
as the whine turned into words , my toddler made a different plea			1
" @entity15 ! @entity15 ! " he cried			1
so what did i do next ? i gave him the @entity15 , of course			1
i tried to justify it -- i had worked 10 - plus hours and gone to school for another three			1
i had to wake up early			2
the truth is , it was 3 a.m. i just wanted to sleep , and if the tradeoff was letting my son watch another 30 minutes of monster trucks on the @entity15 , so be it			2
like many moms , i often get asked how i " juggle it all			1
" for me , " it all " includes working full - time , going to law school four nights a week , raising a toddler and preparing for the imminent arrival of @entity31			1
work , family and ' leaning in ' : seven families trying to make it work honestly , it 's not always perfect			1
and while my lifestyle might not work for a lot of people , it works for me			2
that 's been the key to keeping my sanity -- prioritizing what works for my family instead of focusing on whether it would work for anyone else			1
it 's the nature of raising another person			1
as my husband and i find our rhythm in an unpredictable schedule , i remind myself of a few things that have helped us make it work			2
organizing my time if multitasking is a skill , compartmentalizing is an art. there is no way i can give 100 % of myself to everything i do 100 % of the time , but i can give 100 % of myself to one thing at a time			1
i 've carved out my schedule so i have time to focus on my priorities			2
i get up before my son does so i can focus on schoolwork			2
when he wakes up , i close the books and focus on him			2
when naptime comes around , i get two to three solid hours to study			2
the babysitter comes early enough so i can get in another hour of reading			2
@entity76 : speak up , believe in yourself , take risks when i 'm at work , i focus on my job			1
there 's nothing i can do about looming school assignments or piles of laundry during that time , so there 's no point in worrying about them			1
to help keep these " lives " separate , i keep three separate to - do lists			2
one is for home , one is for work and one is for school			2
@entity96 does n't come naturally to me and it does n't make things stress - free			2
it just helps me to limit that stress to one manageable area at a time			2
share the load there 's been a lot of buzz lately about " leaning in			1
" i 've been focusing on improving my ability to " lean on " -- my husband , family and friends for support			0
it 's hard to ask for help , but it is impossible to balance work , school and family life without it			1
my husband and i work opposite schedules , and he picks up most of the chores that other couples usually share			0
my son has lots of sleepovers with his grandparents			0
learning to say " yes " when people offer to help has been one of the toughest lessons of parenthood , but one of the best things i 've done			1
it 's not a competition in many ways , mommyhood is more competitive than law school			1
when i first became a mom , i felt a mostly self - inflicted pressure to be the perfect mom instead of just me			0
i saw pictures of elaborate parties on @entity141			0
i saw moms planning meticulous arts and craft sessions			1
i looked at my son 's latest drawing , doodles on my textbook			1
my cupcakes will never be worthy of @entity149 , and my son does n't know baby sign language			0
but even if i had all the time in the world , that would still be the case			0
i do n't think any mother would ever claim to know exactly what she is doing , but i am learning to recognize the things i 'll never do well			1
find time to unwind i watch " @entity157 " and " @entity158			0
" i eat dinner with my husband almost every night ( usually around 10 p.m. )			0
i try to squeeze in a mani - pedi every few weeks			0
i am the happiest when i am productive , so even my version of unwinding might be foreign to others			0
i watch tv on my phone while i am taking a shower			0
( trust me , i 've figured out a setup that works			0
) i fold laundry while i watch tv			0
this type of multitasking does n't give any of my priorities less than they deserve			1
when i do n't prioritize a few hours to refuel each week , i can tell , and so can the people around me			0
lighten up the best advice i got before i got married was to know when to lighten up			0
not everything is a big deal			0
i like to think of myself as persistent			0
my husband would probably choose another word			0
but i am learning to loosen up and deviate from my plans			1
i 'm at an advantage			0
the reason i 'm busy is not that i am working multiple jobs to make ends meet			1
part of what makes my schedule manageable is that i enjoy the things that take up my time			0
motherhood is one thing that makes me happy			0
@entity192 does doing well in school			0
a happy mom means a happy family			0
and when that fails , grab the @entity15			0
