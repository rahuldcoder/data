-- while @entity2 's and @entity4 's presidential campaigns rage on toward november 6 , another campaign has been under way for some time , one that 's mostly out of the public 's eye			2
an investigation by @entity10 last month revealed that as many as five @entity12 electors expressed uncertainty whether they would actually vote for @entity4 if he carried their state			2
these electors appear to be unhappy with @entity4 and continue to show support for his primary rival rep. @entity19			2
in the wake of this news , one of the electors abruptly resigned her position			2
on another front , a @entity26 elector suggested that he may not vote for the @entity29 ticket if the candidates fail to furnish their birth certificates ( in an effort to put pressure on all candidates to furnish their birth certificates )			0
these potentially rogue electors would effectively disenfranchise hundreds of thousands , if not millions , of voters			1
the 2012 election will probably be very close			0
consequently , in the worst of scenarios , a " faithless " vote might not only disenfranchise voters but alter the outcome of the race			1
while unlikely , this begs the question : why do presidential electors still have independence in our current presidential selection process ? after examining those who make up the institution , i find one thing increasingly clear : we need to take the guesswork out of the @entity55			1
in 2004 , i published a study aimed at shedding light on the mysterious figures who serve as presidential electors			2
in the hotly contested 2000 election , many electors were subjected to vigilant lobbying campaigns			1
some received thousands of e-mails ; at least one received a death threat			0
a group called citizens for a @entity70 , founded by two college seniors , published the contact information of 172 @entity12 electors online and asked people to urge them to put " patriotism before partisanship " and give their electoral votes to @entity76			1
the group noted that it would have lobbied @entity81 electors to give their votes to @entity83 had he , rather than @entity76 , won the popular vote but lost the electoral vote			1
remarkably , four of the @entity12 electors i surveyed expressed unease over @entity83 's victory and the recounts in @entity91			2
on its face , this would not be cause for great concern			0
however , the 271 electoral votes amassed by the @entity83 - @entity98 ticket barely pushed them over the 270 - vote @entity55 majority needed to win the election			1
consequently , just two @entity12 defections or abstentions would have denied the ticket of a majority of electoral votes and thrown the contest into the @entity108			0
@entity83 would still probably have been elected , but the @entity55 would have created yet another round of uncertainty			1
surveying the 2004 and 2008 presidential electors , i found that the 2000 election was not an isolated event			0
one - third of electors were contacted to change their votes in 2004 , and nearly 80 % were lobbied to change their votes in 2008			1
that year , the bulk of lobbying was conducted by " birthers " who saw presidential electors as a last hope to get their voices heard after their legal battles failed			1
currently , a majority of states and the @entity128 have legal requirements or pledges to ensure that electors vote for their party 's ticket			1
while the overwhelming majority of electors never consider changing their votes , a surprisingly large number do			1
in my survey , nearly 10 % of electors in 2004 and 11.5 % of electors ( including 20 % of @entity12 ) in 2008 gave some consideration to voting contrary to expectations			0
to put this in perspective , this would be akin to all 55 of @entity146 's electors considering defection from their party 's ticket			0
such a prospect is quite unnerving			0
indeed , faithless electors are not fanciful creatures from mythology : nine of the past 16 presidential elections have witnessed faithless votes ( including two of the past three )			1
although none changed the outcome of an election , each faithless vote effectively disenfranchised hundreds of thousands of voters			0
electors are chosen primarily for their party loyalty , not for their judgment regarding candidates			0
whatever one thinks of the @entity55 , @entity166 have come to expect that electors will faithfully translate the popular vote into the electoral vote			1
@entity171 independence simply adds another layer of uncertainty to a process that already has a great deal of cynicism attached to it			0
attempts to curtail faithless votes reflect a very real concern lawmakers and party officials have about the prospect of faithless voting			0
@entity184 , for example , sent letters to each of the 538 @entity12 electors shortly before the 1980 election			0
if candidates are worried about such mischief , citizens should be concerned as well			0
efforts to prevent elector faithlessness , like the @entity198 , would provide greater assurance in the presidential selection process , a process where many citizens already have great concerns			2
too often , laws proscribing faithless voting take place in states after the act has been committed			0
states should move to adopt the @entity198 sooner rather than later			1
doing so would remove the needless uncertainty created by potentially faithless electors and restore some confidence in the @entity55 process			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity211 .			2

rogue electors can disenfranchise millions of voters , @entity211 says
many electors are subjected to vigilant lobbying campaigns to change their votes , he says
we need to take the guesswork out of the @entity55 , @entity211 says
states should move to adopt the @entity198 , he says
