-- after three years in jail and a " trial of the century , " @entity1 is free			1
but the 25 - year - old @entity5 woman faces an uncertain future and an uphill battle as she re-enters society			2
@entity9 was released from jail sunday , 12 days after a jury acquitted her on murder and child neglect charges related to the 2008 death of her 2 - year - old daughter , @entity1			1
following the polarizing verdict , public opinion was not on @entity9 's side			2
the fact that she was given credit for time served on a four - year sentence for lying to police , allowing for her release this weekend , seems to have only added fuel to the fire			0
the " i hate @entity1 " @entity31 page has more than 45,000 fans ; the " f --- @entity1 " page has more than 775,000			1
there are more dedicated to keeping her from seeking refuge in @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 , among other locales			0
death threats and unkind words abound in the social media realm , and in the real world , @entity9 's civil attorney , @entity46 , said he 's received several death threats directed at his client			0
is @entity1 in danger ? @entity9 is not the first acquitted defendant to face an unadmiring public upon her release			1
she 's been compared to @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 , the @entity57 woman who served less than two months in jail on a manslaughter conviction for shooting her preacher husband			1
but even they had the benefit of a support network -- friends , family , entourage -- to help them get back on their feet ( at least for a little while )			1
" the first thing @entity1 needs to do is go to comfort zone and i do n't know where that safe place , that happy place is for her			1
she 's going to need counseling and comforting from others			0
the question for her is where will she find the others ? " said defense lawyer @entity79 , who represented @entity56 in her 2007 trial			0
" my advice to her would be to grow up : you lost three years in prison , try to get your life on the right track			0
i 'd advise her to move from the community in which she lived			0
i might even advise her to change her name and be careful who your friends are , because there will be people who want to latch on to her infamy			1
" plans for her release from the @entity106 and @entity107 in @entity108 reflected the extraordinary level of scrutiny that the case has received			0
law enforcement did n't reveal the time of her release or her precise exit point from the sprawling facility			1
three journalists -- one still photographer , one videographer and a print reporter -- were admitted into the facility saturday night to document her release , but they were n't allowed to share any information until she left the grounds			1
beyond that point , she was to be treated just like any other inmate leaving the custody of the state , @entity106 sheriff @entity124 told reporters thursday			0
" we will not be providing any elaborate security protection for @entity132 once she leaves , " he said			0
" we do n't pick up security concerns unless there 's a credible threat			1
" it 's unclear where @entity9 will head to first for comfort or support			1
she turned down a jailhouse visit from her mother after the verdict and her lawyers have implied that there 's no reunion with her parents planned in the immediate future			1
no friends have come forward to publicly speak on her behalf			1
her most vocal defenders have been her lawyers , who have expressed fear for her safety in light of public outrage over the verdict and sentence			2
" people support her more theoretically than personally			2
they 'll say the verdict shows the system works , stop second - guessing it			0
that 's the support she 's receiving , rather than people supporting her personally or what she did , " said @entity166 criminal defense lawyer @entity165 , who represented convicted wife killer @entity167 in what was referred to at the time as the " trial of the century			2
" the most apparent sign that she has any supporters comes from her jailhouse commissary account , which showed nearly $ 500 in donations from strangers across the @entity177 and @entity178			1
( the money paid for snacks like jalape√±o nachos , peanut m&ms and a strawberry toaster pastry , as well as cosmetics and toiletries : mascara , toothpaste and ponytail holders			0
) otherwise , @entity9 lacks the financial backing that allowed @entity54 and @entity55 to seek refuge in foreign countries while the heat died down			1
@entity54 spent years resuscitating his career in @entity194 after he was acquitted of murder charges in the death of wife @entity197 and her friend , @entity199			1
@entity55 wound up in @entity200 , at the invitation of the king 's son , after his acquittal on child molestation charges			1
@entity9 also lacks the support of friends , family and a group of sympathetic well - wishers that awaited @entity56 upon her release from the mental health facility where she received treatment as part of her sentence			1
@entity56 had a job at a laundromat in @entity219 , @entity57 , and a custody battle for her two daughters awaiting her			0
" the main thing that @entity56 had is , she had the goal of getting her children back			2
she had a purpose and when you have a purpose that keeps you going every day , " said @entity79 , @entity56 's attorney			0
some certainties lie ahead for @entity9 , all drawing her back into the justice system			2
her lawyers have filed notices of intent to appeal her four misdemeanor convictions			2
the move is widely considered to be strategic , as it will allow her to claim her @entity236 right against self - incrimination in the various civil suits piling up against her			0
among those parties is search and rescue group @entity240 , which claims that @entity9 misled them into providing more than $ 112,000 in services in an unnecessary attempt to locate @entity1 for months despite knowing she was dead			1
@entity9 is also being sued for defamation by a woman named @entity246			0
@entity9 told investigators that was the name of @entity1 's nanny and that the woman had taken her daughter			1
the judge handling the defamation lawsuit set @entity9 's deposition for october 8 , despite requests from attorneys for @entity246 , who said they feared she might disappear after her release from jail			0
apart from $ 537.68 she received from her inmate account , @entity9 appears to be broke			2
her lawyers declared her indigent before the trial began and have been defending her free of charge			2
but there could be money for her in her story down the road			2
@entity272 laws , which prevent criminals from profiting off their crimes , would not apply to her			0
could @entity1 get a reality show ? attorneys who spoke with @entity0 said they would not advise her against selling her story after the fervor has died down			1
" the problem is , people get antsy or feel like they 've got to do something or monetize their 15 minutes			0
she does n't immediately need to be doing interviews , photo shoots , anything to bring any attention to herself , " @entity165 said			2
" the public has a very short memory , and if she waits an appropriate period of time , people will move on to the next scandal du jour and she 'll probably be able to build a life for herself sooner than she thinks			0
" really , mr. @entity165 ? " yes			0
come september , when the @entity300 case comes along , people will be focused on that , or an arrest or trial will come soon that will eclipse this , " he said			0
" i 've seen too many so - called ' trials of the century ' that happen biannually			0

@entity1 lacks family , friends , supporters to help her get back on feet
most apparent sign of support comes from donors to her jailhouse commissary account
unlike @entity55 , @entity54 she does n't have funds to flee country
lawyers say she should sell her story when fervor dies down
