-- do n't want the police or your local government to know where you are ? then put your cell phone in airplane mode or turn it off			1
location tracking is inherent in how cell networks function ; otherwise nobody 's cell phone would ring			1
but new evidence from the @entity12 shows that phone location tracking has also become a surprisingly common tool of law - enforcement investigations -- with , but often without , a warrant			1
the @entity12 recently obtained records from over 200 police departments and other law enforcement agencies around the @entity20 they found that " virtually all " of these agencies track the location of cell phones with data supplied by wireless carriers			1
( for information on police in your state , check the @entity12 's interactive map , which shows details from responding agencies			2
not all states or agencies responded to @entity12 's public - records requests			2
) but do n't the police need a warrant for that ? it varies by state , but carriers generally say they require a court order to release this data			1
regardless of these requirements , however , " only a tiny minority reported consistently obtaining a warrant and demonstrating probable cause to do so , " said the @entity12			2
not surprisingly , the @entity12 disapproves of this practice			0
" the government should have to obtain a warrant based upon probable cause before tracking cell phones			2
that is what is necessary to protect @entity20 ' privacy , and it is also what is required under the @entity59 , " states the @entity12 on its site			0
why would police want to track the current location of a cell phone or the history of where it 's been ? according to the @entity12 's records , investigating crimes was a common and obvious reason cited			1
some agencies reported that they track a cell phone 's location only in emergencies , such as to find a missing person -- but others have done this for nonemergency cases			1
sometimes police requested data about all phones accessing a certain cell tower , rather than from a specific phone			2
fewer than 5 % of agencies reported never tracking a cell phone 's location at all			1
depending on where you live , this kind of surveillance may happen a lot			0
according to the @entity12 , " many law enforcement agencies track cell phones quite frequently			2
for example , based on invoices from cell phone companies , it appears that @entity95 , @entity96 , tracks hundreds of cell phones a year			1
the practice is so common that cell phone companies have manuals for police explaining what data the companies store , how much they charge police to access that data , and what officers need to do to get it			1
" according to these manuals , most carriers require a court order to implement cell phone surveillance -- which can range from data about inbound and outbound calls and text messages , to a detailed report of location history based on cell phone tower data			1
costs can range up to several hundred dollars for each request			0
of course , that data might point back to the dead end of a " disposable " prepaid cell phone which can be bought and activated with cash and without identification -- a common strategy for activists , criminals , people in hiding and others with concerns about surveillance			1
so tracing cell phone data is n't a guarantee that police will find the person or information they 're seeking			1
as with searching data stored on cell phones taken from people under arrest ( something which requires a warrant in some states but not others , like @entity146 ) , law enforcement officials often contend that obtaining a warrant to track a phone 's location can delay solving a crime or finding a person in danger			1
but the @entity12 found that some police departments -- notably in the county of @entity155 ; @entity156 , @entity157 ; and @entity158 , @entity159 -- appear to have no problem regularly obtaining a warrant when needed to track a phone 's location			1
this indicates that " a warrant requirement is a completely reasonable and workable policy , " the @entity12 said			2
" the government 's location tracking policies should be clear , uniform , and protective of privacy , but instead are in a state of chaos , with agencies in different towns following different rules -- or in some cases , having no rules at all , " the @entity12 said			1
" it is time for @entity20 to take back their privacy			0
" the @entity12 's records request only applied to police requests for user and tower data from carriers			2
however , there are other ways to track a cell phone 's location which almost anyone can use if you 're willing to pay for it -- and if you can get access to the phone you want to track for long enough to install a bit of software			1
several commercially available mobile " spyware " apps can be surreptitiously installed on a smartphone to track not only its location , but all messages sent and received by any app on the phone ( e-mail , instant messaging , etc. )			0
they record every character you type , and more			0
these apps disguise their presence and remotely report back to a website where the person who 's doing the spying can log in to see everywhere the phone has been , and everything it 's done			0
typically , spyware apps are marketed in a fairly creepy way -- to snoop on spouses or children			0
but spyware can also help stalkers and other criminals close in on their victims			0
spyware is generally legal to sell , but it may not be legal to use			0
that does n't stop people from using it , of course			0
it 's unknown whether @entity20 state and local law enforcement agencies ever use mobile spyware , but clearly they 're not the only ones who might want to know where you are and what you 're doing			0
your best line of defense from mobile spyware is to always protect your phone with a passcode or swipe pattern , even at your office or home			0
if people ca n't easily access your phone , they ca n't easily install spyware			0
requiring warrants for all instances of cell phone tracking and surveillance based on carrier data is one step that the @entity12 advocates			1
this would at least increase transparency and accountability for the practice			0
but if the police decide they want to know where you 've been , it 's likely that your carrier will tell them , for the right price			2
and right now , there 's no way to prevent that			0
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity269 .			0

@entity12 : phone location tracking is a common tool of police , often without a warrant
fewer than 5 % of agencies say they 've never tracked a cell phone 's location
most carriers require a court order to implement cell phone surveillance
cell phone companies have manuals for police explaining what data they store
