-- few things are worse for the traveler than nasty surprises			2
not simply because we like to travel or because we must travel , but because we accept that the world is an imperfect place and the travel industry an imperfect business that likes , when possible , to get by on the bare minimum			1
nevertheless , there are some fixes that could be implemented quickly and cheaply that would make travel much more pleasant for everyone			1
we seek neither the impractical ( first - class leather seats in coach ) , the implausible ( teleportation ) , nor the unrealistic ( airport concourses that demand less walking than a breast cancer fund - raiser )			2
even better , none of the brainstorms below are protected by patents , licenses or other legal restrictions , so @entity25 can feel free to scoop them up and begin making our lives better right away			1
update hotel check - in times in 1946 , the @entity30 'm convenience - store chain extended its hours from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. , announcing its groundbreaking move by changing its name to @entity34			1
in 1974 , the company now known as @entity36 booted up the world 's first 24 - hour atm network			2
in 2005 , @entity39 and @entity40 ushered in the era of never - ending beer drinking by granting licenses allowing pubs to serve liquor round - the - clock			2
yet as nonstop commerce has created a sleepless planet , hotels remain mired in conventions of the 1800s , when the steam train rolled in and out of town once each afternoon and again the following morning			2
with airlines cleaving away from the hub - and - spoke system -- which once rigidly controlled arrival and departure times -- in favor of more or less continuous schedules and red - eye flights , the hotel industry needs to restructure its own arrival and departure policies to reflect modern traffic flow			1
few miseries compare to landing in a city at 6 a.m. only to while away the morning in traveler 's purgatory awaiting an " early " 1 p.m. check - in that you had to grovel to get			1
the major hotel chain that figures out a way to implement " anytime check - in " on a mass scale will become the new @entity75			1
unless , of course , @entity75 gets to it first			0
invent a universal plug socket a few years ago , tech - connected people lived in an era of many too gadgets and not enough laptop sockets , wondering why the hell devices could n't just share the same plug - ins			0
then someone invented the usb			0
the travel industry is suffering from a similar connection problem			1
two thin pins in the @entity90 ; two round pins in @entity91 ; three chunky pins in the @entity92 ; three even chunkier pins in @entity93 , with some smaller three - pins occasionally used for really old lamps			0
there are attempts to paper over this dilemma			0
but what if you 're not lucky enough to be in a business hotel with a full 3x2 foot panel dedicated to a dozen types of plug shapes ? what if you do n't want to carry around three different personal plug adaptors that might work , if you 're lucky ? @entity109 has started to try to solve this problem , with some hotels employing single , all - purpose wall sockets able to accept various shapes and numbers of pins			1
is n't it time everyone started doing the same ? 3			1
bring us the check introducing the future of good service -- the coffeecheck			1
nothing spoils a meal like being held hostage to an uppity or lackadaisical waiter 's notion of when you 'll be allowed to leave the restaurant			0
checks should be delivered with the final course , at least for businesses lunches			0
abolish institutionalized taxi extortion one of the enduring mysteries of travel is the shocking percentage of municipalities that allow the first impression of their cities to be an extortionate us $ 65 cab ride from the airport to downtown			1
does the @entity143 run every taxi company in the world ? is it too much to ask that visitors to major cities be spared from getting fleeced as if they 've concluded a losing transaction with a neighborhood bookie as soon as they get to town ? affordable rides into the city would eliminate a significant amount of the stress and hassle endured by visitors coming to a place for the first time			1
if private enterprise ca n't responsibly accommodate tourists , local legislation should be employed to force them into it			0
offer upgrades whenever possible airline upgrades are the @entity167 of the travel world			1
people talk of them in hushed tones , with shrugged shoulders , their faces darkened in some corner of a rural tavern as they exchange secrets on how and where you might be able to score one			0
we understand the consumer psychology behind premium - level status -- you start giving away your exclusive product and suddenly it 's no longer exclusive			0
but while most consumer - facing industries like to improve customer experiences whenever possible , the airline industry seems to go out of its way to keep its passengers grumpy and miserable			0
the hotel industry is a little better			1
@entity194 has a policy of upgrading to the next level of room or suite if available when you check in			1
but for the most part hotels avoid upgrading , too , and we suggest at some cost			0
would n't the word - of - mouth and social media praise be worth it from customers grateful for surprise upgrades if they occurred more often ? 6			0
retire the beverage cart on short flights responsible for more mashed toes and dislocated elbows than the @entity211 , these 300 - pound chariots of doom present passengers in aisle seats with a constant danger , cost airlines millions and keep us from hitting the head at precisely the moment we most need to			0
to shave expenses , airlines have already done away with most food			0
the next logical step is ending the tiresome drink service that creates more trouble than it 's worth			2
for flights of two hours or less , hand out bottles of water and sell beer , wine and drinks in the departure lounge			0
this will save the airlines money and labor and , for customers , eliminate the risk of being sideswiped every five minutes by the polyestered haunch of an exhausted flight attendant horsing a @entity242 weight up and down the aisle taking drink requests and barking orders -- " keep your feet in ! " " watch your knees ! " -- with all the @entity249 © lan of the guy who sits in the booth and weighs you in at the dump			1
just stop talking , please the first port of call for most vacations -- the airport -- is invariably an unending and un-ignorable procession of barely decipherable @entity260 announcements , most of which are entirely superfluous			0
noise equals stress , so airports should be minimizing it wherever possible , not adding to it			2
we know by now to keep our luggage with us at all times , that airports are non-smoking areas and if you have had to call mrs. @entity273 nine times to " proceed immediately to gate number 12 , " it 's safe to say she does n't care or she is n't able			2
and while you 're at it , how about upgrading those 1930s - quality public address systems in airports and on planes ? 8			1
eliminate the paper trail why do we need a tissue - thin napkin every time someone on an airplane hands us four ounces of water in a urine - sample cup ? former @entity287 chairman @entity286 once famously saved his company us $ 40,000 a year by eliminating the olive from salads the airline once served onboard			1
a small redwood forest could be recycled from the napkins airlines plow through each year			0
make booking more transparent you think you 've found the deal of a lifetime , till you click " checkout " and the price suddenly doubles due to the airport tax			2
or you spot an airline ad for " us $ 10 deals " to the other side of the world , but you have to book on exactly the right day and on the right flight to take advantage and they do n't mention when that is			2
a little transparency from the start would go a long way to making the booking process far better			0
give us our phones back if you can get a 300 - ton hunk of iron and aluminum into the sky , surely you can figure out a way for us to use our @entity320 without it causing a disaster ?			0

listen up , @entity25 ! these fixes would make travel more pleasant for us and maybe save you money .
do we really need a napkin every time someone hands us a drink ?
let us check into a hotel any time of day .
upgrade the quality of public address systems in airports and on planes .
