dynamic hairdos , gravity - defying clothes and exotic weapons are the hallmarks of the dedicated anime fans who proudly dress up as their favorite characters			2

" @entity41 is at @entity5 in @entity0 this weekend to show off his collection of more than 12,000 original production cels , backgrounds and layouts from " @entity22			1
" instead of dressing up like his favorite " @entity22 " characters , @entity41 has tattooed scenes from the movie on his arms and leg			1
his devotion to " @entity22 " started with an unassuming , purple - hued background cel that opened his eyes to the level of art that is possible through anime			1
" that piece is the lynchpin to this whole exhibit , " said @entity41			2
" when i found it , i did n't even realize it was part of ' @entity22 ' at first because it was hidden behind all those layers of great art.

by offering mature art and story lines , " [ ' @entity91 ' ] saved anime , " said @entity80 , who is collaborating with @entity41 on the " @entity91 " exhibit			1
" when you see the film , your jaw drops			0
it 's beautiful ; it 's an astounding feat. but you miss so much because there 's fantastic art on top of fantastic art on top of fantastic art. when it 's pulled apart and each layer is presented to you individually , you have a chance to fully appreciate the magnitude of the artistic effort that went into this			2
to look at one cel gives you an idea of how much work went into each and every cel			0
" @entity22 " is " considered the pinnacle of animated art by a lot of aficionados , " said @entity118 , co-founder of the @entity119			1
" [ the artists creating ' @entity22 ' ] actually hand - painted 160,000 cels to make the film			1
and a huge number of backgrounds , probably at least 10,000 backgrounds , i 'm going to guess			2
it was a stunning film ; it had a huge budget , " he said			0
people visiting the exhibit tell @entity41 and @entity80 that " @entity22 " has dramatically influenced their lives			1
" for some of them , it introduced them to the fact that cartoons could be art , and then they began to pursue cartoons as an art form			0
for others , it really did speak to them on a different level , of these teen characters and the angst they were going through			0
and it spoke in a true voice			0
" these were n't @entity155 teenagers who were waiting to be kissed by a prince			0

" " i had never really seen anything like it , but after i did , you 'd better believe i started looking for anything else like it i could find , " he said			0
" it was a game - changer for a lot of people , i think			0
" " @entity22 " made it possible for anime to thrive in the @entity36 , said @entity118			1
before " @entity22 , " anime " was exclusive , there were no major distributors , so fans would hand down third - or fourth - generation @entity185 copies with blurry subtitles , " he said			1
but as entertainment companies began lucrative distribution operations in the 1990s and 2000s , the anime fan base became as diverse as the genre itself			2
one especially popular practice now is cosplay , in which fans dress up as their favorite anime characters , taking great pains to get the costume details exactly right			0
