@entity0 , @entity1 -- gasoline at $ 4 a gallon is no worry for @entity6 , the billionaire energy investor from @entity7			1
he drives from his home to his office in a car that runs on fuel costing less than $ 1 a gallon			1
his method : he has a device that fuels his @entity17 with natural gas from the pipes that serve his home			2
and he thinks there 's a lesson there for @entity24 's energy woes			0
@entity6 , who is speaking wednesday at the @entity25 in @entity0 , @entity1 , said @entity24 needs to make natural gas a building block of a plan for ending oil imports from the @entity30			1
natural gas is " cheaper , it 's cleaner , it 's abundant and it 's ours , and we 're fools not to use it , " @entity6 said in an interview with @entity2			1
@entity6 , an 83 - year - old trained geologist who has been working in the energy field since 1951 , said the @entity24 could use domestic resources to replace the 5 million barrels of oil imported daily from @entity30 , which makes up a quarter of @entity24 's daily use of oil			1
the @entity24 natural gas reserves amount to the equivalent of three times the oil reserves possessed by @entity46 , he said			1
" all you need now is leadership , " he said , lamenting that @entity24 " has no plan , we 've gone 40 years with no energy plan			2
we 're the largest user of oil in the world			0
" @entity6 ' plan is encapsulated in the @entity56 , a bill with @entity59 and @entity60 sponsors , that would provide tax credits to replace diesel - fuel burning truck engines with natural gas - powered engines ; users of natural gas as a transportation fuel would pay fees that would make up for the lost government revenue			1
his firm , @entity70 , has a vested interest in energy policy since it invests in energy futures and the shares of firms in a variety of parts of the industry			0
he said the worry over increasing fuel prices in the @entity24 rests in part on a lack of understanding of the energy market			2
energy prices in @entity24 are by far the cheapest in the world , with @entity87 paying more than double to fuel their cars and with natural gas costing four or five times as much in @entity87 and @entity92			1
promises of much lower fuel prices are a fantasy , @entity6 said , since the world 's demand for oil is roughly equal to the amount that is being produced			2
@entity6 said the media should challenge @entity60 presidential candidate @entity101 on his claim that if elected he can lower gasoline prices to $ 2.50 a gallon			2
" you 've got @entity106 saying do n't pay @entity30 $ 100 for the oil			0
just tell ' em you 'll give them $ 50			0
" really ? i go into @entity106 's hotel , it 's $ 1,000 for a suite and i say i 'm not going to give you that , i 'll give you $ 200			0
i 'm on the street looking for another place to sleep			0
you ca n't tell ' em i 'll give you $ 50 when the world market is $ 100			0
it just does n't work that way			0
" he said he still favors wind energy , which was a key part of the " @entity119 " he put forth in 2008 , but the price of natural gas is now so low that wind projects ca n't compete economically , @entity6 said			1
with 70 % of everyday oil use going to transportation fuel , he said the impact of putting a much cheaper fuel such as natural gas into the market will be to bring the price of gasoline and diesel down			1
his current plan is focused on moving trucks to natural gas , but he said president @entity135 could also urge consumers to commit that their next car will run on a domestically produced fuel , whether it 's natural gas or a plug - in electric vehicle			1
a @entity142 editorial tuesday , headlined " @entity147 , " called @entity6 ' plan " the hottest energy fad in @entity150 " and criticized it for proposing subsidies for a natural gas industry that should compete on its own			1
the start - up costs of relying on natural gas for transportation are n't cheap			2
the cost of replacing truck engines is roughly $ 35,000 apiece , @entity6 said			0
his own natural gas car costs thousands more than a gasoline - powered @entity17 , and then there is the cost , which he said was $ 2,000 , to install the natural gas fueling device for the car			1
and @entity24 consumers have only that one natural gas model from which to choose			1
in @entity165 , he said , there are 62 models that use natural gas			0
@entity6 said @entity24 carmakers do produce such vehicles for overseas markets but have not seen a viable market in this country			0
one of the concerns is that there is n't a widespread network of service stations that could refuel a natural gas - powered car			1
@entity6 said natural gas is available in pipes that go down every street and alley , so it could eventually be more accessible for refueling			2
" somebody says you could n't get in that car and drive to @entity187 , well , you could -- you 'd have to do a little work to see where the stations are , but i 'm not going to drive that car to @entity187 , i 'm going to drive that car from my house to my office			0
" and if he is going on a trip to @entity187 ? " i 'm going to get in my wife 's car			0
she has a bigger car			0
women always have bigger cars than men do			0

energy investor *t.* @entity6 : @entity24 needs leadership on energy
he says vast reserves of cheaper , cleaner natural gas could displace @entity30 oil
@entity6 : @entity24 could have a more secure energy *system* and help control gas prices
he *commutes* in a natural gas - powered car whose fuel is less than $ 1 a gallon
