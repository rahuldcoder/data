they dress like allies , but they kill like enemies			0
gunmen wearing @entity5 military uniforms turning against coalition troops has been an ongoing nightmare for @entity9 's @entity8			1
it happened again tuesday , when a man believed to be an @entity5 soldier killed @entity14 maj. gen. @entity13 and shot several others at a military training facility in @entity17			1
it 's impossible to tell if or when the next " green - on - blue " attack might occur			0
but here 's what we do know : how often do these attacks happen ? such assaults were rare in the first few years of the @entity25 , averaging no more than one a year through 2008 , according to the @entity27			2
but after the " surge " of 33,000 @entity32 troops in 2009 , the number of insider attacks jumped to four			1
the attacks spiked in 2012 with 48 , according to a @entity35 report			2
the incidents have declined since then , with 15 attacks in 2013 and two in the first quarter of 2014 , as more troops withdraw and coalition forces try new ways of mitigating the attacks			1
" despite this sharp decline , these attacks may still have strategic effects on the campaign and could jeopardize the relationship between coalition and @entity52 ( @entity52 ) personnel , " a @entity35 report said			1
who carries out these attacks ? sometimes it 's actual @entity5 soldiers or police officers ; sometimes it 's insurgents such as @entity61 militants disguised as @entity5 security forces			1
the @entity61 acknowledged gen. @entity13 's killing tuesday , but has n't claimed responsibility for it			1
@entity35 spokesman rear adm. @entity66 said officials believe an @entity5 soldier was the gunman			2
an @entity8 official said the group of coalition forces was standing outside , and the attacker shot from inside a nearby building at a distance of about 100 yards			1
the @entity35 is n't commenting on the possibility of @entity61 involvement , saying the @entity5 military and international forces are in the early stages of an investigation			1
but the @entity61 have claimed responsibility for previous attacks			1
the terror group even released a video showing how their fighters trained to break through the fence at @entity87 , the site of a 2012 assault that left two @entity32 @entity89 dead and six jets destroyed			0
@entity9 said the @entity61 militants were wearing @entity14 uniforms			2
they also carried automatic rifles , rocket - propelled grenade launchers and suicide vests			0
what are the motives ? the intentions can run the gamut			0
witnessing the horrors of war sometimes inspires soldiers to turn against their onetime allies , said @entity104 , a @entity105 counterterrorism analyst and former @entity107 official			2
in 2012 , the deadliest year of insider attacks , a @entity35 official said the @entity32 estimated 40 % of them were due to @entity5 members ' own combat or emotional stress , and 15 % are a result of intimidation by the insurgency or actually being recruited by it			1
the official said about 10 % came from impersonators who are not part of the military			0
but in more than 30 % of the assaults , no clear motivations were found			0
in many cases , such as in tuesday 's attack , the answer might never be known because the assailant was killed			0
how does the @entity5 military vet its soldiers ? military recruits are vetted by their high school grades , an entrance exam , a health screening and biometrics , said @entity135 , deputy spokesman for the @entity136			1
they must also pass a background check and provide two references who are government employees			1
it 's still unclear whether the gunman in tuesday 's attack had @entity61 ties or whether he slipped through the military 's screening process			2
" i do n't think we should look and make judgments about the vetting process too quickly , " @entity104 said			0
" you would think on the surface that maybe he was recruited by the @entity61			2
that 's not necessarily the case			0
" what about allied forces turning against @entity5 civilians ? in march 2012 , @entity14 staff sgt. @entity156 slipped away from the camp where he was stationed and into a village in @entity160 province , where he began shooting at civilians			1
he returned to the base , reloaded , and went out again to target another village			0
he left a trail of blood and gore in both villages , with nine children among the dead			0
witnesses claimed the @entity32 soldier dragged some bodies of his victims ' outside and set them ablaze			0
by the end of the rampage , 16 villagers were dead			0
@entity177 was charged with murder and eventually sentenced to life in prison			0
@entity177 described his attack as " an act of cowardice " and said he 'd taken steroids and drank sporadically			0
the @entity61 vowed to retaliate " by killing and beheading @entity32 anywhere in the country			2
" what can be done to mitigate insider attacks ? coalition forces have started using what they call " guardian angels , " or armed troops who oversee others during meal times and when soldiers are sleeping			1
two years ago , after the deadliest spate of attacks , troops started receiving a fold - up pamphlet called " inside the @entity202 " to help prevent such assaults			2
a @entity35 official said it advises troops under attack who have their own weapons on them to " resolve the situation with forces at hand " and not wait for backup			1
unarmed troops at meetings or dining halls have been vulnerable in the past , but now , all are carrying their weapons , preloaded with a magazine of ammunition			0
weapons must be within arm 's reach at all times , according to @entity32 military sources			0
the pamphlet also offers broad indicators of behaviors by @entity5 that could indicate they are a threat , the @entity35 official said			1
things to watch for include complaints about other countries or religions , comments that advocate violence , a personality change , becoming isolated and not wanting to be around others , speaking in favor of radical ideology or showing an undue interest in coalition base headquarters or living quarters			0
but @entity66 said insider attacks are " a pernicious threat " that are " difficult to always ascertain , to come to grips with ... anywhere , particularly in a place like @entity5			1
" " @entity5 is still a war zone , " he noted			2
what 's the future of @entity32 troops in @entity5 ? in february , the @entity252 administration announced it had started planning for the possible withdrawal of all @entity32 troops by the end of 2014 if @entity5 did not sign a security agreement pertaining to rights of @entity32 troops operating there			1
president @entity252 called for 9,800 @entity32 troops to stay in @entity5 after the end of 2014 , along with some allied forces			1
the number would get cut roughly in half by the end of 2015 , and a year later the @entity32 military presence would scale down to what officials described as a " normal " embassy security contingent .			0

@entity5 *defense* official : recruits must pass background checks and provide government references
insider attacks are sometimes committed by @entity5 soldiers , sometimes by the @entity61
official : motives range from emotional stress to being *influenced* by insurgency
coalition forces use " guardian angels , " or armed troops who guard at meal times and at night
