-- the subject of erotica has a way of making people uncomfortable			2
some might break into schoolboy titters in the face of mature art -- a harmless enough response when you stop to think that in the past , artists with a penchant for sexual depictions have actually been killed ( or very nearly )			2
reverend @entity13 -- who , with 28 warehouses storing more than three million pieces of erotica , may own the world 's largest collection -- recalls the life of @entity19 , a @entity20 artist and collector who was ultimately put to death for his racy sketches			1
" his work was hidden away for 30 years , and it 's absolutely gorgeous stuff , " says @entity13			1
in more recent history , there was the attempted shooting of pornography kingpin @entity28 , which left him paralyzed from the waist down			2
" erotic art has n't had an easy route , " admits @entity13 , whose own trajectory has been anything but ordinary			1
an ordained @entity37 minister , @entity13 became a purveyor of the art form during the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 70s , when he was often called in as an expert witness in a series of obscenity trials directed at the porn industry			1
in 1976 , he founded the @entity46 , where he currently houses some of his collection , and offers degrees in subjects of public health and sexological research			2
his interest , @entity13 claims , is mainly academic , and while such a statement might draw ridicule in some circles ( like claiming to read @entity56 for the articles ) , he maintains that open access to erotica is pivotal not only in fostering an open society , but in education as well			1
" i believe sex education through the arts is incredibly important			0
as i see it , the arts are a good way to help people to be less judgmental			0
it also helps give people an idea of what they can and ca n't do sexually , and i believe that everybody deserves a good sex life , " he says			0
over the years , a handful of sex - themed museums have popped up globally , aimed at forging a more open conversation on the topic			1
here are some of the more unique offerings around the world			2
@entity82 's @entity81 ( @entity83 ) formerly the @entity81 , this 24,000 - square - foot space dedicated to all things sex closed its doors in february due to a falling out between the museum 's founder and @entity13 -- who loaned a good share of his collection			1
the good news is , the space reopened a couple months ago and , in addition to some of @entity97 's pieces , it will also exhibit examples of sexual hypocrisy in politics , religion and entertainment , strange sexual practices , insect genitalia and the history of sexology			1
@entity82 's @entity81 , 3275 @entity107 , @entity83 ; +1 702 794 4000 the @entity108 ( @entity109 ) did n't know phallology was a real thing ? that 's because it was n't , until @entity108 coined the term ( which , incidentally , refers to the study of penises )			2
@entity117 founded the @entity108 in 1997 , a one - of - a - kind institution dedicated to the collection of mammal phalluses			1
today his son @entity122 , who has grown the offerings to include 283 pieces , including a human specimen and a 165 - pound , 5.5 - foot long sperm whale penis , runs the museum			2
" the museum 's role is to display mammalian penises in an informative and educational way , and to lift the taboo surrounding this part of the mammal anatomy , " says @entity122			1
the @entity108 , @entity134 116 , @entity109 , @entity135 ; +354 561 6663 @entity136 ( aka , @entity137 ) and @entity138 ( @entity139 ) it 's hardly surprising that @entity139 , often deemed one of @entity143 's freest cities due to legalized prostitution , is home to two sex - themed museums			1
@entity136 ( @entity147 of @entity148 ) has the honor of being the world 's oldest and longest - running institution of this type			1
it 's a small space , often crammed with tourists , and the collection remains fairly modest , with an assortment of @entity158 pornography the main highlight			1
@entity160 of @entity161 opened earlier this year in a former brothel			0
the space offers a fascinating look into the everyday lives of prostitutes and offers a history of the profession , which was legalized in @entity139 in 2000			0
@entity136 , @entity169 18 , @entity139 ; +31 20 622 8376 @entity138 , @entity170 60 - 62 , @entity139 @entity171 ( @entity172 ) @entity172 's @entity171 has a gift for combining the academic with the just plain silly			2
in addition to a permanent collection of 15,000 erotic artifacts , the museum regularly hosts exhibits that can range from the informative ( the @entity180 ) to the bizarre ( a recent show , " @entity183 of the @entity184 , " featured a breast - themed inflatable )			1
the museum also features @entity185 , a bar serving up bawdily named cocktails			0
@entity171 , 233 5th @entity187 , @entity172 ; +1 212 689 6337 @entity188 ( @entity189 ) @entity189 's @entity188 ( @entity188 ) hosts some of the most respectable erotica around			1
in addition to the curiosities that litter the 4,000 - strong collection ( a @entity195 - themed four - poster bed , a six - foot carved wood phallus ) are works by @entity198 and @entity199			2
the museum 's octogenarian owner , @entity200 , is invested in showing that there is more to erotic art than pornography ; it can be fine art , and it can represent a window into different cultures			1
as a result , the museum showcases a range of art spanning both the globe and the ages			2
@entity188 , 1205 @entity187 , @entity214 ; +1 305 532 9336 @entity215 ( @entity216 ) the @entity218 capital may seem a strange spot for a sex museum , given the country 's track record both with free speech and gay rights			2
but then again , museum founder and curator @entity225 does n't much care for the current government			0
some pieces on display are clearly aimed to provoke ( the main attraction -- a painting by artist @entity233 that depicts @entity218 president @entity234 doing naked battle with @entity236 -- is a case in point )			0
other items -- such as @entity241 - era condoms and pamphlets on @entity243 -- offer onlookers a glimpse of what sex was like behind the @entity247			0
on site is also a sex shop ( @entity218 's largest ) , which sells everything from naughty - themed matryoshka dolls to sexy @entity253 uniforms			1
@entity254 , @entity255 15 , @entity216 ; +7 495 695 44 30 @entity256 ( @entity257 ) as it happens , inventors have long been obsessed with tools to improve sex ( or , inversely , abstain from it )			0
@entity257 's @entity256 has a range of such gadgets on display , from 16th century chastity belts , to copulation tables ( predecessors to the blow - up doll )			0
there 's also a cinema that shows early pornographic films			0
if nothing else , the space is tribute to the inventiveness of the human mind -- particularly when it comes to sex			0
@entity256 , @entity280 476/18 , @entity257 ; +420 227 186 260 @entity281 ( @entity282 , @entity218 ) @entity282 's @entity281 made headlines in 2004 when it acquired a 12 - inch human penis supposedly belonging to the " @entity285 , " @entity285 ( the claim has not been verified )			0
either way , @entity218 's first erotic museum houses a great collection of historical paraphernalia , with particular focus on the sex lives of former @entity218 rulers			1
they even have a " naughty chair " that supposedly belonged to @entity296			0
in addition to lifting the veil on sex , the curators hope to provide visitors with a fresh perspective on how sexual practices differ from culture to culture , and ultimately evolve over time			0
@entity306 , @entity307 43/45 , @entity282 ; +7 812 905 03 94 @entity308 ( @entity309 ) @entity309 's @entity308 takes an artistic and historic approach by including work by some of the great masters ( @entity199 made enough erotic art to go around ) , as well as a historic look at @entity317 pornography			1
a particular highlight is the institution 's collection of banned @entity322 art. @entity323 , @entity324 96 , @entity309 , @entity317 ; +34 933 189 865 secret cabinet , @entity326 ( @entity327 , @entity328 ) the @entity329 had an acute appreciation for erotic art. such was made evident during a 19th - century excavation of the ruins at @entity334 and @entity335 in @entity328			1
alas , the freewheeling art that was uncovered proved too much for the socially conservative mores of the @entity158 era			0
well - endowed statues depicting various gods , sexually explicit oil lamps and a sculpture of @entity344 co-mingling with a goat were all moved to @entity327 ' @entity346 , where they were eventually locked up inside a secret cabinet , opened only for the purview of well - educated gentlemen			0
the cabinet was frequently opened and closed to the public , depending on the conservatism of the regime in charge			0
in 2000 , the collection was again opened , this time to women as well			0

in recent years , several museums dedicated to erotica have popped up around the world
