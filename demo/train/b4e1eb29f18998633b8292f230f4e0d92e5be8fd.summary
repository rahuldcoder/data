-- to get through the long , tedious hours sitting in the fossil archives at the @entity3 , @entity1 would listen to the hypnotic sounds of @entity5			0
so when he happened upon one of the biggest lizards that ever walked on land , he found it fitting to name it after the band 's frontman , @entity11 -- the original @entity11			1
but that 's not what makes this find interesting			1
it 's what the existence of the " @entity18 " tells us about the effects of climate change that 's intriguing			1
the climate connection lizards , like snakes and turtles , are cold - blooded animals			1
they depend on warmth from their surroundings to heat their bodies			1
and when the environment warms up , they become more active , get hungrier , eat more and grow			0
for six years , @entity1 sifted through fossils of animals that lived 40 million years ago , looking for clues on climate change			1
then it jumped out at him : the @entity18 , as @entity1 named his now - extinct lizard			1
@entity1 and his team introduced it in a study to be published wednesday by research journal @entity44 " it struck me that we had something here that was quite large and quite unique , " he said			0
the find was striking , because when it comes to climate trends , bigger reptiles point to a warmer climate , @entity1 said			0
" one of the things you can actually do is estimate past temperatures by looking at the body size of fossil reptiles , " said @entity1 , a paleontologist who studies the @entity55 and its atmosphere at the @entity57			1
the lizard 's hefty size helped confirm the elevated global temperature during a period known as the @entity70 greenhouse			1
" this would be a globally warmed time in @entity55 's history , where there 's no ice at the poles , " @entity1 said			2
there was a lot of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere back then			2
sound familiar ? man - made global warming in the 21st century is pushing temperatures back up in that direction , he said			1
current average temperatures are only about 2.5 degrees celsius shy of where they were 40 million years ago , @entity1 said , when the @entity18 grazed in the forests of what is now @entity90			2
the @entity5 connection the lizard 's proper scientific name is @entity94 , and there is a backstory to how @entity1 arrived at it			1
the @entity5 is @entity1 's favorite 60 's rock band			2
the @entity5 ' founder @entity98 dies at 74 " i had their albums going on kind of endless loop while we were writing and doing the analysis on the lizard , " he said			2
the size of the lizard took him by surprise			1
it reminded him of the nickname of now deceased @entity5 singer @entity11 , also known as the @entity11			0
@entity11 also had a reputation for standing up for the environment			0
the king - size lizard , the ecological connection			1
for @entity1 , the name fit			0
the @entity18 was no dinosaur			0
it was smaller than today 's crocodiles and komodo dragons			2
but those are carnivorous reptiles			0
it was six feet long and weighed as much as a @entity127 shepherd , pretty sizable for a lizard			2
@entity1 says he has n't found fossil records that show why the creature eventually went extinct			0
the big deal the evolution of such a large reptile shows what a huge effect a slight warming bump can have , @entity1 said			2
with the ice caps gone , @entity55 's climate became warm and muggy , and forest covered the planet			0
there was plenty of greenery for the chubby lizard to munch through			0
as man - made climate change progresses , existing reptiles will spread out into new territory , @entity1 predicts			1
so can we see another spurt of such giant lizards ? unlikely			0
for them to evolve to the size of the @entity18 , they would require global temperatures to slowly rise a few degrees and then remain stable for a very long time			1
today 's climate is warming so rapidly that " we 'll basically block off their ability to respond to the temperature increase , " @entity1 said			1
instead of evolution , he said , we 'll see extinction			0
or , as @entity11 sang , " this is the end , my only friend			0
" more space and science news from @entity0 @entity166 follow @ @entity167 on @entity168			0
