@entity0 -- the @entity3 is recalling 44,000 combat helmets -- some of which are being used by @entity8 troops in @entity9 and possibly @entity10 -- after they failed to meet ballistics testing standards , an @entity3 official announced monday			1
gen. @entity13 , who 's responsible for buying and testing equipment for soldiers , told reporters at the @entity17 the recall was issued thursday			1
tests showed the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) , which is standard issue for all soldiers , did not meet service requirements			0
@entity13 said he was not aware of any injuries or deaths related to the recalled helmets			2
the move was triggered after the @entity27 informed the @entity3 about an ongoing investigation into the company that makes the helmets , @entity29 , formerly @entity31 " there is evidence that @entity29 and @entity38 were produced using unauthorized manufacturing practices , defective materials and improper quality procedures which could potentially reduce ballistic and fragmentation protection , " said an @entity33 message released may 14 to soldiers around the world			1
after the @entity27 's notification , the @entity3 conducted ballistic tests on the helmets and found they did n't meet service standards			1
it is unclear why the helmets failed the most recent tests but passed initial testing when the @entity3 first contracted with @entity29 in 2006			2
the @entity3 has an additional 55,000 helmets in storage			1
those are also part of the recall and will be destroyed to ensure they are not distributed , @entity13 said			0
the @entity3 refused to accept delivery of another 3,000 helmets recently , bringing the total of problem helmets to 102,000 , @entity13 said			1
the helmets cost $ 250 each , and @entity13 said the @entity3 is investigating whether it can recover funds already paid to the company			2
the 44,000 recalled helmets had been sent to locations all over the world for distribution			0
some 24,000 of them were sent to a distribution center that gives them to other services as well			0
" we do n't know where they are , so they could be on a soldier 's head in @entity10 or @entity9 , " @entity13 said			2
" we are seeing some getting returned in @entity78 ( @entity9 )			0
" a statement posted on the @entity29 website says the @entity3 has not notified the company about the recall			2
" @entity29 was not informed of this recall before we saw the press release on friday evening			0
we have not heard from the government regarding the recall and have no additional information , " the statement said			0
@entity3 officials said they were not required to tell the company about the recall because the military owned the helmets			0
@entity13 said the @entity3 had already broken its contract with @entity29 earlier in the year because of other problems with the helmets , including paint chipping off			1
@entity3 officials could not discuss details about the problems with the helmets because of the @entity27 investigation , but they said the ballistics tests showed they would not protect a solider against a worst - case scenario strike on the helmet			1
@entity13 said general ballistics tests showed that while a bullet would not penetrate the helmet , they still failed to meet stringent @entity3 requirements and " fell short of the required ballistics test			1
" three other companies also make the helmets , and replacement helmets are already being distributed , an @entity3 statement said			0
the recall affects about 4 percent of the more than 1 million @entity117 in the @entity3 's inventory , according to @entity3 statistics .			0

some helmets in @entity9 have already been turned in
@entity3 has additional 55,000 helmets in storage ; total of 102,000 helmets to be recalled
