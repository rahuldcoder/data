-- the parents of a 10 - year - old @entity3 girl who 's been waiting more than a year for a lung transplant says the girl has essentially been " left to die			1
" @entity6 , who has had cystic fibrosis since birth , could die within weeks without a transplant			1
she has been waiting 18 months for another pair of lungs as her ability to breathe has rapidly deteriorated			1
she is at the top of the list for any pediatric lungs that may become available for transplant in her six - state region			2
doctors say modified adult lungs could help save her , and adult lungs become available much more often			2
but children under age 12 are n't prioritized for adult organs , under federal rules			2
so @entity6 could only get available adult lungs if everyone else waiting for lungs in her region -- no matter how sick they are -- turns them down			1
@entity34 @entity33 secretary @entity32 has called on officials to review the nation 's lung transplant policy for children , but any change could take up to two years			1
organ donation by the numbers a statement from @entity43 and @entity44 welcomed the policy review as a " positive step			1
" " however , @entity6 , and other children like her who need a transplant now , do not have the luxury of time to wait for a lengthy bureaucratic change , " the parents said			1
" essentially , @entity6 has been left to die			1
" the department said sunday it is sympathetic to the many parents facing similar circumstances			0
" our heart goes out to any family that is dealing with a loved one who is on a waiting list for an organ transplant , " the statement said			1
" given the significant disparity in the number of transplantable organs to the number of people in need of an organ , ( the @entity72 ) has regulations and policies to ensure that decisions are based on the best medical science and the most equitable process in a very difficult situation			2
" the @entity79 asked that other parents consider naming @entity6 as a transplant recipient should they or one of their children face death in the coming weeks			1
" if you want to directly donate your loved one 's lungs to @entity6 , the law can not change that			1
and @entity6 will use that and create a positive and wonderful life and legacy for your loved one , " @entity44 told @entity0			1
" i 'm praying that somebody sees this story and is in a position to save my baby			1
" @entity6 had a setback sunday night , suffering from a fever and increased carbon dioxide levels , according to a post on @entity44 's facebook page			2
" i am feeling anxious and praying , " she wrote			2
the @entity72 , a nonprofit that manages the nation 's transplant system under federal contract , agreed to the review friday , the same day @entity32 sent an urgent request for it to look at its policy , @entity72 spokeswoman @entity102 said			1
but because the review process involves research and public comment , which take time , and because there are not enough organ donations for children , the nation 's transplant system may not be able to save @entity6 's life			1
her family wants @entity32 to step in			0
" we are going to let a kid die over red tape			0
somebody needs to stand up that this is n't right , this is a human issue			0
this is n't politics , this is a human issue , " @entity44 said			0
@entity102 urged more @entity34 to look at an organ donation website			0
@entity32 ' request to the @entity72 called on officials to look at the age categories used in lung transplant cases			1
@entity6 's struggle has ignited a fight for new rules governing organ donations			2
she 's been in a @entity137 hospital for months due to her cystic fibrosis			0
tens of thousands of people have signed a petition on @entity142 , and a congressman has called on the @entity145 administration to take quick action			0
@entity6 's mother told @entity0 she was " shocked " when she learned the rules a couple of weeks ago			2
@entity32 asked for the policy review in a letter to dr. @entity151 , board president of @entity72			2
@entity32 cited the significant disparity between the number of transplantable organs and the number of people in need of an organ , especially among children			0
she also directed @entity33 's @entity160 of @entity161 to consider new approaches for promoting pediatric and adolescent organ donation			0
" with 1,819 pediatric patients on organ transplant waitlists and only 852 pediatric organ transplant donors each year , it is especially clear that we can and should , if possible , do more to encourage the public to become registered organ donors , " @entity32 wrote			0
@entity72 issued a statement last week noting that there is a separate policy for children because the " biological needs and circumstances of candidates younger than age 12 are different from either adolescent or adult candidates			0
one key difference is the size and lung capacity of donors and patients among these age ranges			0
" children younger than age 12 are prioritized for donations from other children of similar age and size within a 1,000 - mile radius			0
policies allow " status adjustments for specifically defined groups of candidates with unique medical circumstances not addressed by the overall policy , " the statement said			0
the network routinely reviews policies and considers " public input as well as medical data and experience , " the statement said			0
dying girl 's plight sparks fight over organ transplants @entity0 's @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity211 contributed to this report .			0
