@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the days following @entity1 dictator @entity6 @entity5 's ousting last january , some media reporting on the so - called " @entity4 " presented the internet as the unique factor that led to the fall of his authoritarian regime			1
but was this revolution -- which i call the @entity4 -- really driven by the internet ? how did internet and social media help in overthrowing dictatorship ? initially , traditional @entity1 media ignored clashes between security forces and peaceful protestors -- who rallied after the death of @entity23 by self - immolation -- in @entity25			1
they then lied about it because , i believe , they were trying to impose a media blackout -- as it had been the case in 2008 , during the social movement triggered by protests in the @entity34 mining region			1
nevertheless , videos showing @entity23 's burning body and the clashes immediately starting circulating on the web			1
people captured @entity23 's action using their cell phones ; they recorded it and uploaded to @entity41			1
a year later , @entity23 's legacy still burns i am one of those " geeks , " who are constantly connected to the internet			1
i was in front of my screen that day when i found the video showing what was going in @entity25			1
i was shocked as it was not the first time a young @entity1 had committed suicide by self - immolation			1
some months prior , @entity54 had done the same , for similar reasons			2
i wanted to travel to @entity25 and see what was happening , but i was unable to afford it			0
i did , however , want to spread the word about the horrifying incident			0
i was already in touch with lawyers and a large network of cyber-activists , so i contacted them to collect information , verify it , write about developments and share everything online			2
this was not an easy task			0
my blog , @entity41 profile and @entity73 account were blocked , before being hijacked , probably by @entity1 cyber police			1
at first , i was able to circumvent censorship and update both my blog and @entity41 profile regularly			0
but after the hijacking episode , i had to create new accounts			0
my profile had grown through december , as i took part in demonstrations denouncing the violence used against peaceful demonstrators , and shared my photos and video on @entity41 and @entity73			2
at the time , i was also assisting foreign media by giving phone and @entity89 interviews			0
on january 8 last year , some @entity91 journalists asked me to assist them in the protest areas			0
i did not think about it at all			0
i just packed and accompanied them			0
tunisians mark anniversary of president 's ouster this journey took us to @entity101 , @entity25 , @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104			2
i took photos of the dead and succeeded in capturing some of the atrocities and crimes of @entity5 's regime and police against peaceful protestors			2
i was posting everything on the internet			2
on january 9 , when i was in @entity102 , i went to the house of @entity115 , a young man killed just a few hours prior to my visit during a massacre in the city which i suspect was committed by police			0
it turned out to be a key day in my trip			0
when i shared my photos , plus images and videos that young residents of the city had given to me to spread through the internet , i was contacted by journalists and people from all over the world			1
by this time , cyber activists were sharing my work spontaneously , and i was doing the same with theirs			2
and this is the strength of the internet			2
the overlapping of contacts and sharing of information by those belonging to the same networks allows the dissemination of information among thousands in a short time			0
what happened in @entity25 surprised us , as it surprised the entire world			0
i had not coordinated as i had for past campaigns ; it happened automatically			0
former @entity1 leader faces trial over killings a previous campaign i had been involved in was " @entity153 , " a demonstration against censorship that was organized in april 2010			1
that campaign did , indeed , convince people to leave their screens and to act on the ground			0
i do not think the internet was , in and of itself , the reason behind the success of @entity1 's uprising			1
however its use , and cyber activists ' ability to share information and mobilize people , pressured @entity5 's regime			2
but the internet was only one in a long chain of factors which led to the revolution			1
@entity1 people were rising up against the socio - political situation			1
they were willing and determined to get rid of injustice , corruption , nepotism , and poverty			0
it was the nation 's longing for freedom , dignity and social justice which led to the end of @entity1 's dictatorship			1
people fed up with oppression and inequality defied the violence of the police of a threatened regime			0
we should never forget that in @entity1 everything started on the ground , in real life			1
we should never forget that @entity199 , both men and women , sacrificed their lives to allow us to live in dignity			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206			1

the @entity1 uprising was triggered by @entity23 's death by self - immolation
videos showing @entity23 's burning body circulated the web
@entity206 posted online what she saw of the revolution , it was spontaneously shared
but she says the internet was only one thing in a chain of factors which led to the revolution
