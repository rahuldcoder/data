-- it 's @entity2 , and i 'm here to tell you to scare your kids fearlessly			1
it 's good for them			1
early last summer , my 9 - year - old daughter and i took a trip to @entity13			1
@entity14 loves roller coasters ( we first tackled @entity18 's @entity17 and its blinding 80 - mph speed when she was 4 )			1
but vertical plunges ? no. that day i repeatedly asked her whether she 'd like to try @entity22 , a coaster that ( egad ) ascends 121 feet before plummeting down a ( double egad ) 97 - degree drop			1
she 'd shake her head , " no. " once she overcame the fear and took the plunge , i thought , genuine euphoria would ensue			1
finally , i made an offer			2
" @entity14 , " i said , " if you go on @entity22 , i 'll let you play three games and buy you a soda ( banned in our household )			2
" ok , " she said , gulping			2
" i 'll do it			2
" when the attendant locked down the protective bar , tears appeared			2
" i do n't want to do this , " she said			2
" daddy , i do n't want to do this			2
" onlookers began to stare			2
" honey , are you ok ? " an employee asked			2
" do you need to get off ? " " nooooo , " @entity14 said , still crying			2
" no. " the ride started to move			2
straight up , staring into the blue @entity50 sky			2
" @entity51 , noooooooo , " @entity14 wailed			2
" @entity51 , i ca n't do this ... @entity53 ... " i was the worst father in history			0
we began our steep downward plunge			0
i turned to look at @entity14			0
she was grinning , ear to ear			0
" @entity60 ! " she screamed			0
" this ! is ! awesome ! this ! is ! awesome ! " it was			0
as yet another october 31 approaches , i 've been thinking a lot about @entity14 and @entity22 and the virtues of a scared tyke			0
last weekend , at my children 's elementary school , the wife and i organized a halloween party that included , for the first time , a haunted house			1
the fare was pretty typical : a man in a @entity80 mask reaching out toward people , a cemetery filled with zombies , a crazy chef cooking guts and eyeballs			0
it was held in a dark hallway and despite that was clearly more about fun than fear			1
yet one after another , parents questioned me about whether their 6 - to - 11 - year - old tykes were ready for a fright , whether perhaps being too scared would create some sort of enduring mental impairment that could haunt their dreams ( and ruin their @entity96 futures )			1
i was n't merely asked whether the house was scary			0
i was asked whether @entity99 could " handle it			0
" " he might flinch a little , " i 'd say			0
" but he can handle it			0
" some turned away angrily			0
about 400 kids took the plunge			1
some cried at the end , but only a few			0
truth is , sometimes kids need to be scared			1
and forced to try things that might feel uncomfortable or awkward or even terrifying			0
but , handled right , can also allow them to emerge feeling proud , brave and accomplished			1
" children are resilient by nature , " said @entity112 , a prevention specialist in the @entity115 , @entity116 , public school system			0
" as long as there 's some support available , they can bounce back from difficult experiences without much trouble			1
" in her work , @entity112 is part of a team that takes inner - city children to a ropes course in the woods			0
there 's a zipline , and it 's high and long and daunting			1
" the kids have to be pulled up , and when they 're ready to stop they yell out , ' ok , stop now ! ' " said @entity112			1
" but we always say , ' are you sure you do n't want to go a bit further ? ' we try and talk them into it , because the goal is to have them experience life			0
without crossing a comfort line , that 's hard to do			1
" are there limitations ? surely , said @entity143 , a psychologist with the @entity145 public school system			0
in @entity116 parents should already be cued into their kid 's emotional readiness			1
" it 's not about age , " @entity143 said			1
and then there is common sense : " what you need to be aware of is what 's developmentally appropriate			1
blood and guts flying out from the ceiling atop a 6 - year old probably is n't the best thing			0
" then again , she said , " at least if a parent is there , it can explained and grasped			0
children can be very concrete			0
so they need an outlet to discuss these things			0
haunted houses can be a lot of fun for young kids			1
but it 's valuable to have an adult nearby			1
" @entity2 is about candy and masks , but it 's also about crossing that comfort line : a crazy day when a kid can stroll through a haunted house , ring a doorbell and see the unfamiliar face of someone who gives him or her candy , talk about ghosts and goblins and things that go bump in the night			1
it should be a little scary ; let them handle it			0
more than ever , parents today seem obsessively determined to do more than merely observe and ( if needed ) explain			1
we unnecessarily hold our kids back a year of school in the name of " getting ahead			1
" we present every member of every youth team with a season - ending medal , even if they went 0 - 11 and scored -23 goals			0
we kick off the school year by demanding principals place our precious darlings with just the right teacher in just the right environment with just the right classmates			0
we coddle and comfort and make certain no step will be taken without a fluffy pillow to fall back upon			1
well , to hell with that			0
unless your child is absolutely petrified beyond belief ( like , ahem , my son ) , find the nearest haunted house , plunk down the $ 20 and take your children for the most frightening little walk of their lives			0
then watch as they scream their heads off -- and rave about it right after			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 .			1

@entity224 : daughter feared roller coaster , rode it , loved it . same with @entity2 scares
he says parents should let their kids get a little terrified at @entity2 . it 's good for them
parents should support , explain , use heads on *appropriateness* but not overly *shield*
@entity224 : kids can confront fear , emerge feeling proud , brave . we coddle too much
