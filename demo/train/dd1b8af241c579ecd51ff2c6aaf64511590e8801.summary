-- the last few months have witnessed a dramatic turn in the way democratic politics are conducted in a sovereign country that is also a member state of the @entity5			0
the depth of the economic crisis and the increasing dependency of @entity9 on external funds to survive have led to an unprecedented degree of national humiliation and destabilization of the political system			1
@entity9 parliamentary practices are operating under emergency procedures , a government has been overturned overnight and constitutional practices are being bypassed			1
the national parliament , the symbol of representative and competitive democracy in @entity9 , has become purely symbolic and procedural in the way it votes for its austerity laws			1
external pressures to impose a special commissioner to run the country 's finances and recommendations regarding the date of national elections -- and the most desirable outcome -- are all attacking the heart of @entity9 's democracy , its sovereignty			1
to be sure , @entity9 democracy was far from perfect before , suffering from clientelism , nepotism and corruption , but it had made significant strides since the country 's entry into the @entity44 in 1981			1
similarly , national sovereignty had become vulnerable way before 2009 , as a result of increasing debt to unsustainable levels and a state deficit whose extent was not even calculated properly			0
yet what we are seeing now is the undermining of @entity9 's political class , and a fall in levels of trust in the political system			2
the historical responsibility for this state of affairs lies with domestic mismanagement , political incompetence and the constant missed opportunities for reform			0
this unprecedented level of economic recession and social alienation means @entity9 democracy is moving backwards at a rapid pace			1
in times of crises , history comes back with a vengeance			0
there are those who revisit the past in order to understand what went wrong and blame the main culprits for the impasse			0
others refer to similar historical parallels and focus their attention on comparable historical moments			0
indeed during the history of modern @entity9 , democracy has often suffered from instability , uncertainty , military intervention and authoritarian or exclusionary practices			2
a frequently mentioned historical reference is the interwar period , when the economic crisis shook the @entity9 political environment , and led to instability , military coups and eventually the fascist dictatorship under politician @entity98 in 1936			2
some remember the years of @entity101 occupation during @entity102 and the humiliating blow to @entity9 's national dignity , a very popular reference in present - day @entity9 and an impulsive reaction to the current pressure from @entity108			0
others refer to the more recent past of the post-war period of the 1950s and 1960s when the country suffered from an exclusionary and defective semi-democratic process led by the triarchy of the monarchy , the military and the right - wing forces			0
this type of illiberal and exclusive democracy led to the imposition of the military junta in 1967			0
as with these historical examples , observers of the current political instability are worried about the high levels of disapproval among @entity9 's political class , the extent of social reaction and mobilization on the street and the degree of political polarization			2
@entity9 is gradually losing its middle class , the pillar of the political center , as politics is increasingly dominated by extremists of both sides			1
as usually happens during political instability , the extremists are the ones that gain in strength while those in the center become most vulnerable			0
indeed , recent opinion polls show a remarkable defeat of the two - party system -- the center left ( @entity149 ) and the center right ( @entity151 ) -- as voters move towards left - wing politics and , occasionally , the extreme fascist right			0
in the past , @entity9 democracy often suffered from polarized and extreme politics			1
but the reasons were endogenous and had to do with the balance of power between the military , the monarchy and party politics , and the reactions of those who were excluded and wanted to participate in the political process			0
politics in post-civil war @entity9 was a clear example of polarization and political exclusion			2
for the first time since the 1974 transition to democracy , @entity9 democracy has experienced an unprecedented level of development and consolidation which is inter-connected with the country 's membership of the @entity44			1
ironically , it is the source of @entity9 's democratic strength that threatens today the achievement of the past four decades			0
for the first time , the threat to @entity9 's democracy comes from the club of western democratic states , who treasure liberty , promote and assist democracy and use their normative soft power in international politics			1
it is a democratic @entity108 ruling political class , a democratic government fully accountable to its citizens , which recommends a commissioner , suggests that technocratic governments are maybe more efficient and is afraid of @entity9 national elections			2
it is the eurogroup of the democratically elected financial ministers of the rich , prosperous northern @entity200 countries that is curtailing the choices of a free government and are demanding the strict supervision of a fellow member state			1
@entity9 democracy is threatened by the very entity that contributed to its consolidation			1
@entity9 democracy is not in danger of falling into the hands of the military because the @entity9 military is confined to its barracks , is well under civilian rule and military rulers have no interest in political intervention -- not that there is any political power left to seize anyway			1
the danger to @entity9 's democracy comes from abroad , where the urge for the economic competitiveness of the country through internal devaluation is hurting political competitiveness and freedom of choice			2
since its inception as an independent state , @entity9 has looked to the west to improve its democracy , for the emulation of models in the state administration and education and legal systems			2
the @entity235 has been the main orientation of a country on the periphery of @entity200 's geography , which provided the templates for reform and modernization			0
more recently , the accession into the @entity44 unleashed all the benevolent forces of @entity9 democracy in the company of the most advanced democracies of the world			1
and countless times , @entity9 and other southern @entity200 countries were presented as excellent examples of democratic consolidation , examples to be followed by the post-communist central and east @entity200 states			1
the @entity5 has been the beacon of constitutional practices , human rights , party political competition , and the main source of strength of the international standing of its member states			0
what we are seeing now in @entity9 is democratic regression to pre-membership levels , polarized politics , the undermining of the ruling classes and the loss of national sovereignty			1
soon the country will urgently need a " pre-accession strategy " of political reconstruction , next to a much - required strategy for economic growth			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity277 .			0
