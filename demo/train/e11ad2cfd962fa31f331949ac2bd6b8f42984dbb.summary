-- get ready : the 2016 campaign for the @entity2 is getting under way			0
among those attending next week 's @entity6 meeting in @entity7 are the group 's chairman , @entity11 gov. @entity10 , as well as popular @entity6 governors such as @entity14 's @entity13 , @entity16 's @entity15 and @entity18 's @entity17			1
while the @entity6 's annual confabs are all about policy and politics , 2016 is sure to come up because all four governors are thought to be contenders for the party 's next presidential nomination			1
even though the 2012 election is barely in the rear view mirror , speculation over the next race for the @entity2 is getting started			0
with president @entity31 winning a second term on tuesday , an incumbent will not run in 2016 , meaning both parties may have competitive nomination battles			0
@entity35 : ' you 'll vote for me in 2016 ' the two names grabbing the most attention in the hunt for the next @entity42 nomination are vice president @entity35 and secretary of state @entity43			1
as he was leaving a @entity45 voting booth on @entity46 , @entity35 was asked whether it was the last time he 'd cast a ballot for himself			2
" no , i do n't think so , " he replied , smiling			0
last month , he dropped a mention of a possible ' 16 bid			0
while on a phone call with a voter in @entity54 , the vice president discussed health care and insurance , making his case for the president 's health care reform law			0
" and after it 's all over , when your insurance rates go down , then you 'll vote for me in 2016 , " he said			0
@entity35 , who will be 73 on @entity46 2016 , made unsuccessful bids for the nomination in 1988 and 2008			2
as for @entity43 , it does n't matter how many times the soon - to - be - former secretary of state says she wo n't run for president again , there 's always speculation that she may change her mind between now and the next presidential cycle			1
when asked by @entity73 last month if she would make another bid for the @entity2 , she said , " no , i 'm not			0
" @entity43 repeats ' no ' for 2016 " i have been on this high wire of national and international politics and leadership for 20 years , " @entity75 said			2
" it has been an absolutely extraordinary personal honor and experience			0
but i really want to just have my own time back			0
i want to just be my own person			0
i 'm looking forward to that			0
" but until she makes a shermanesque statement , speculation will continue			0
" the truth is , everyone else is frozen until @entity43 decides what she wants to do , " a @entity42 strategist , who asked to remain anonymous , told @entity0			1
in addition to @entity35 and @entity75 , there are some other possibilities			2
former @entity95 gov. @entity94 did not run for the @entity42 nomination in 1992 , which went to @entity75 , but will his son , @entity95 gov. @entity97 , go where his father did not ? @entity97 is up for re-election in 2014			1
also possibly considering the @entity2 is term - limited @entity101 gov. @entity100 , the current chairman of the @entity102			0
other governors who might be considering runs are @entity105 of @entity106 and outgoing @entity108 gov. @entity107			2
and then there 's the @entity110 , where all 100 members may imagine themselves as president			0
sens. @entity114 of @entity11 , @entity115 of @entity116 , @entity117 of @entity95 , and even sen. - elect @entity118 of @entity106 could be on any list of potential presidential candidates			1
the @entity42 strategist has some advice for potential candidates : " everyone who wants to run for president in the @entity42 should beat a path to @entity126 's door			1
then camp out in @entity127			0
" @entity126 was @entity31 's campaign manager , and @entity127 , of course , traditionally kicks off the presidential primary and caucus calendar			2
as for the @entity131 , @entity13 is at the top of any potential list			1
but before any run for the @entity2 , the @entity14 governor next year faces what may be a tough re-election campaign in a blue state			1
@entity10 , who is term - limited at the end of this year and who was considered a possible running mate for @entity142 , may want to make a bid for the top spot			0
@entity15 is a hero to many conservatives , thanks to his battles against public sector workers in @entity16			0
after surviving a recall election this year , @entity15 is up for re-election in 2014			0
@entity13 : @entity142 ' did n't get enough votes ' @entity17 , who 's very popular among fiscal as well as social conservatives , is also entertaining thoughts of running for president , and @entity157 gov. @entity156 , who has to decide about running for re-election in 2014 , may also take a second shot at the @entity131 nomination			1
@entity142 's running mate , rep. @entity161 of @entity16 , returns to his leadership role in the @entity2			0
will @entity161 , a favorite of fiscal conservatives and many tea party activists , make a run for the top spot in the next presidential cycle ? this week 's election proved that the @entity131 has a problem with @entity172 voters			1
will freshman sen. @entity173 of @entity54 , a @entity131 rock star who 's urging his party to address this problem , make a run for the @entity2 ? if he does n't , maybe his mentor , two - term former @entity54 gov. @entity176 , who has strong relations with the @entity172 community , could make a bid			1
@entity173 , by the way , will be in @entity127 in a week and a half to headline an event for the state 's @entity6 governor			1
@entity173 is n't the only @entity6 senator whose name comes up			1
add @entity188 of @entity189 to the list			0
and will freshman sen. @entity191 of @entity192 follow in his father 's footsteps and run for president ? @entity191 talks 2016 prospects the @entity131 is famous for awarding the nomination to the candidate who came in second in the previous primary cycle , like with @entity142 this time			2
if that 's the case , then watch former sen. @entity202 of @entity203			0
he gave @entity142 a run for his money , he 's from an electoral - vote - rich state that the @entity131 think they can reclaim , he 's got a working - class background , and he 's beloved by social conservatives			2
add in two more names from the 2008 cycle : former @entity212 gov. @entity211 , who performed much better than expected in the @entity131 primaries , and former @entity215 gov. @entity214 , who was her party 's vice presidential nominee that year			1
@entity211 is still popular , thanks to his radio programs and weekly show on @entity220 , and @entity214 still commands a loyal conservative following			0
" there is a vacuum of leadership right now in the @entity131			2
whoever steps up right now to point the party toward its future will help the party and advance their own fortunes politically , " says @entity6 strategist and @entity0 contributor @entity225			1
but @entity225 , who was a senior media adviser to @entity142 's 2008 @entity2 bid , says do n't look to the past			2
wishing for a @entity173 run " the next @entity6 nominee will be tasked with taking the party into the future			1
it wo n't be the old retreads			1
it wo n't be @entity202 , @entity211 or @entity214			1
we need a new @entity6 from the ranks of @entity131 governors , senators , or even @entity176 and ( former secretary of state ) @entity245 who still represent the @entity131 's future			1
" so what do these possible 2016 wannabes do as the very early preseason begins ? if they do n't have leadership pacs already , they form them , make speeches , campaign for fellow party members in the 2013 and 2014 races , write books and do cable news interviews , as they build up allies and support in the states that vote early in the primary and caucus calendar			2
" this is n't a phase where people decide to run for president , it 's when they start to do things that leave that door open , " says a different @entity42 strategist , who predicts that " there will be a wide open field on both sides next time around			1

the @entity131 's next presidential nominee might be at @entity6 governors gathering
@entity14 gov. @entity13 tops the list , but he has tough *reelection* fight ahead
@entity35 and @entity43 are mentioned most often as @entity42 candidates
@entity131 strategist says retread from past races wo n't be able to take party into the future
