a 5 - year - old girl chats up classmates while waiting for the bus after school			1
the topic : playing with a @entity6 " bubble gun " that , with the flick of a finger , blows bubbles everywhere			1
" i 'll shoot you , you shoot me , and we 'll all play together , " the kindergartner says			0
the next day , that remark -- which was made innocently , according to the lawyer for the girl 's family , who related the story -- landed the young central @entity20 child in the principal 's office			1
soon after , she was sent home after being issued a 10 - day suspension for a " terroristic threat , " as indicated on the suspension form signed by @entity27 area elementary school principal @entity26			1
that and other documents were provided to @entity30 by @entity31 , the lawyer representing the girl and her mother			2
@entity34 did not respond to a request monday from @entity30 for comment			0
the superintendent 's office for the @entity39 did issue a statement , stating that " by law we can not officially comment on the specifics , " while expressing confidence that the story circulating in the media " may not be consistent with the facts			0
" " when given the opportunity in the appropriate forum , we look forward to presenting information that will portray our school district in a more positive light , " the school district said			0
surprise ! @entity54 packed you a nice gun while the girl and her family have n't spoken on the record -- and asked not to be identified -- their attorney , @entity31 , has			2
he said the child has been very upset since the incident , even after the school system shortened the suspension from 10 to two days			2
one piece of evidence he points to is a letter from a professional counselor , an appointment requested by the school , who talked to the suspended girl and her mother two days after the incident			1
in it , the therapist describes the child as an apparently " typical 5 - year - old by temperament and interests " with no history of mood swings , irritability , depression , attention deficit disorder , learning issues or other problems			0
also , according to the counselor 's letter , the girl had " no play guns or play knives , " either in the bus line or at home , where her mother prohibited them			2
" it would appear that ( the girl ) does not have those risk factors identified for violent behavior , " the therapist wrote			1
" it would also seem that ( she ) had no harmful or predatory intent in the comments she made to her friends about the bubble ' gun ' but did not recognize the heightened sensitivity and awareness of her friends and the response that may result from her comments			1
" the story began around 3:15 p.m. january 10 , outside the school in @entity27 , a community of fewer than 6,000 people about 60 miles between both @entity115 and @entity116 , @entity117			1
that 's where the girl and her friends , whom she " loves , " began talking about a " princess " bubble blower and a @entity6 bubble gun			1
the reason , she told the counselor , was that one of her friends likes princess toys and the other likes @entity6			1
during this conversation , the kindergartner admitted she talked about shooting the bubble gun			1
then she went home happy , positive and outgoing , just as she 'd gone to school , her mother told the counselor			0
the next day , the girl was called in front of a teacher , according to @entity31			0
then she sat down with a school administrator and , eventually , the principal			0
the subsequent suspension form , issued that day , lists another girl as a " victim			0
" it does n't elaborate on what happened , but it does mandate a 10 - day out - of - school suspension or a " medical / psychological evaluation given ( the ) nature of ( the ) offense			0
" on january 12 , the suspended girl met with the counselor , both independently and with her mother the therapist wrote that he found no evidence or history of behavioral issues or poor parenting and determined " it appears ( the kindergartner ) engages in positive peer relationships			0
" the counselor also noted that the child was aware of last month 's deadly shooting at a @entity164 , @entity165 , elementary school that ended with 27 people -- including 20 children ages 6 and 7 -- dead			2
as to her own feelings about talking about shooting in her conversation with her classmates , the girl told the counselor , " i did n't mean anything bad			2
" on january 14 , the @entity176 principal issued a second suspension letter , which superseded the previous one			0
noting no criminal complaint was made " due to ( the ) ages of the children , " she cut the suspension down to two days while changing the categorization of the incident from " terroristic threat " to " threat to harm others			1
" now that the girl has returned to school , her family has two goals , according to @entity31 : to get an apology and to get the suspension expunged from her record in part so she can transfer to another school			2
the school system has n't done so , though the lawyer said there is a meeting involving him , family members and school officials set up for january 30 on the matter .			0

a @entity117 school suspends a kindergarten girl for making a " terroristic threat "
her lawyer says she playfully talked of " shooting " a @entity6 bubble gun with friends
the school later reduces the suspension , but still finds she made a " threat to harm others "
a counselor says the girl has no risk factors for violence and had no " harmful *...* intent "
