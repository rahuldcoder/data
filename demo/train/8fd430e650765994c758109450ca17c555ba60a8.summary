-- if you want a world - class education without the hefty price tag it usually carries , it 's time you pack your bags and head to @entity8			1
the country 's federal state of @entity11 became the last region to scrap tuition fees in mid-october , which means that studying in @entity8 is now completely free even for international students			1
so wherever you come from , doors of elite institutions like the @entity17 and @entity18 , both among the world 's top 100 universities , are flung wide open if you 're a gifted student			0
" we do n't want higher education which depends on the wealth of the parents , " @entity21 , minister for science and culture of @entity11 told @entity24			0
her @entity30 counterpart @entity29 , whose region abolished fees in 2012 , called tuition fees socially unjust : " they particularly discourage young people who do not have a traditional academic family background from taking up studies			0
it is a core task of politics to ensure that young women and men can study with a high quality standard free of charge in @entity8 , " she told @entity45 's @entity44 newspaper			2
low cost / high rank @entity8 has had a long tradition of free education , introducing fees only in 2006 when the constitutional court ruled that moderate tuition fees were not at odds with the country 's pledge for education for all			1
however , even at around $ 1,300 per year , significantly lower than $ 14,500 and $ 30,000 paid by @entity62 and @entity63 students respectively , the fees caused widespread backlash , with federal states dropping them one by one			2
the funding gap was mainly bridged by the government , with the average worker in @entity8 facing a tax burden on labor income of 49.3 % in 2013 , the second highest rate out of 34 @entity74 member countries			2
the country is already a major destination for international students , ranking third in the world after the @entity63 and @entity45 , according to data from the @entity74			1
overseas students flock to the @entity8 's illustrious universities , attracted by the relatively low cost of living and a vibrant cultural scene and nightlife			1
independent thinking but before you pack up and go , be aware that studying in @entity8 can be a very different to campus - based life common in the @entity63 and @entity45			1
lectures often pack up to 200 people , and there is a greater onus on the student to keep track of all the reading and deadlines			0
" i feel like @entity98 universities are a bit more like schools , they really look after you , print out your timetable for you , and if you miss a seminar they ring you up and ask is everything ok			0
in @entity8 , you have to be more independent , " says former @entity0 intern @entity104 who spent a year studying at @entity106 's @entity105 during the 2011/2012 academic year			2
" my campus was spread all over @entity106 , so i would take the underground between classes			0
that was very difficult if you did n't know the city because there was n't really anyone to help you , and the buildings were sometimes out of the way , " adds @entity104 , who completed her studies at @entity45 's @entity112			0
navigating your way social life for international students can also be harder to form , as many @entity8 students study in their home town and often live with their parents , or share an apartment with friends			1
but if you negotiate those challenges successfully , @entity104 says that the @entity8 system offers freedom to expand your interests : " there is a lot less pressure on students because they are not paying for it , so it 's more about the pursuit of learning than just passing an exam and forgetting everything			1
but you are the one propelling your education forward , not the lecturer			0

but the university system is very different to the one in the @entity63
