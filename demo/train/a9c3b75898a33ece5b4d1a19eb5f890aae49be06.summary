@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 prides itself as the pinnacle of technical innovation and sports cars of the imagination -- but sometimes the sport needs bringing back down to earth			1
so on wednesday @entity10 showed @entity3 a possible back to basics vision of the future as it debuted a new 18 - inch tire -- a size fitted to many everyday road cars -- on the final day of the @entity0 in - season test			1
the concept tire is five inches taller than the sport 's current 13 " wheel and has a lower profile -- which means it 's comprised of a larger wheel rim and less rubber			1
@entity24 test driver @entity23 trialled the new rubber at the high speed @entity0 , the stage for @entity31 's @entity30 @entity29 victory on sunday			0
a former @entity33 and @entity34 racer , @entity23 set a lap time of one minute , 44.728 seconds on the new tire -- nearly 10 seconds off the fastest lap set on 2014 rubber			2
" we were n't looking for performance , " @entity10 motorsport director @entity39 told reporters			2
" the priority today was to show people what a formula 1 car would look like with a change in rim			0
" from what i 've seen and heard people seem to quite like the idea			0
most people said it looked quite modern -- it did n't look strange			0
" @entity10 could roll out the new tires as early as 2016			1
producing @entity3 tires , which are the same specification as road car tires , would make it easier to share technology , as well as to reap the commercial benefits of being able to sell its customers replica @entity3 rubber			1
" we do n't actually make any 13 " tires apart from for @entity3 and the @entity67 and @entity68 , " explained @entity39			0
" the tire today looks more like the product we sell on a regular basis			0
" our business is focused on large wheel diameters and 18 " is almost standard for us , it 's the sort of thing you get on a sporty road car			1
" others might say there 's less advertising space so there is a strange conundrum			0
" our high end business is in wheels around 20 " -- so that 's the other discussion to have , should we be really going for a much bigger wheel ? maybe @entity3 needs to do something more dramatic			0
" assessing the tires after running on them for just 14 laps , @entity23 said : " the overall grip was very low and ( the car ) was five or six seconds off the pace , mainly for the reason that all the aerodynamics and the rest of the car are made for the tire we are running now and not the 18 "			1
" i think in the philosophy it will be a type of tire that will react quickly , so the reaction you get in the steering wheel is more nervous and each time you get a snap it 's quicker			2
" if we go one day to this type of tire it will be a big challenge first for the team because they will have to build a completely new car around it and it will also be a challenge for the driver			2
" asked by @entity2 if he liked the aesthetics of the tire he said : " honestly , i thought they were a bit too big but maybe it was because it was the first time seeing them on the car ! " @entity10 took over from @entity122 as @entity3 's official tire supplier in 2011 but a series of dangerous blowouts in 2013 left it reeling			1
after making substantial changes to its rubber , @entity10 's contract was renewed until the end of the 2016 season			2
a switch to a more standard 18 " wheel might be an incentive for other tire manufacturers , such as @entity133 , to consider a return to the sport			1
but any tire change will have to be agreed by the sport 's governing body , the @entity139 , its commercial rights holder @entity142 and the teams			2
the taller tires -- which are almost as high as the sidepods of the @entity24 chassis -- will affect the aerodynamic flow , weight and suspension of the cars			1
" we know what 18 " will mean -- it 's a bigger challenge , " @entity39 continued			0
" there will be variations in pressure , there will be sensitivity on the car 's camber and in @entity3 you go over the curbs a lot more so you do have an integrity challenge			0
" today is a first step and it 's in the hands of the sport to decide what they want to do			0
" after a major rule change , focused on new engine technology , for the 2014 season , the teams might be reluctant to embrace change again			0
as one team official whispered in the @entity0 pit lane during wednesday 's test : " @entity179 is fear			0
" @entity39 countered : " change is expensive , change is challenging and i 'm sure the team engineers will be scratching their heads going ' no , no , no. ' " but others will be thinking maybe it is one of the aspects that needs to change in @entity3 to bring a different look and feel to the sport			0
" the @entity139 might look more favorably on a tire development that would bring the sport closer to road car technology			1
this season 's new engine regulations were partly designed to align @entity3 with the " greener " hybrid technology now seen as essential to the future of road cars			2
the future of the multimillion dollar sport -- which now only has @entity201 and @entity202 as the two major car manufacturers running teams -- also relies on its road car relevance for its long term survival			1
could a change of tires be another step towards securing its future ? it 's all about the tires : @entity10 plan on hold @entity10 comes out fighting over @entity3 tire chaos @entity201 and @entity10 face sanctions over @entity3 tire test			1

@entity10 debuts 18 - inch wheel as the sport tries to stay in touch with road car reality
a switch to a more standard 18 " wheel will be an incentive for other tire manufacturers
the taller tires will affect the aerodynamic flow , weight and suspension of the cars
