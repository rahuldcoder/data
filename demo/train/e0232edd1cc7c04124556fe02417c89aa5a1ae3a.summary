@entity0 -- the family of @entity4 teen @entity3 got a call hours after she was abducted demanding money and drugs for her safe return , according to a criminal affidavit filed thursday			1
kidnappers did ultimately free @entity3 -- without getting anything in return -- leaving her at an aunt 's house in @entity15 , @entity4 , and ending a harrowing 36 - hour ordeal that began 25 miles away with a brazen pre-dawn break - in punctuated by gunshots , threats and screams			1
while there 's no dispute young @entity3 was abducted against her will , there are questions as to whether it was a random act			1
the affidavit 's claim that her kidnappers asked for drugs , in addition to money , in their phone calls may speak to this point			0
a man tied to this week 's kidnapping , @entity39 , was one of five arrested in a 2012 raid in @entity41 , south of @entity0 , in which authorities found 500 pounds of marijuana , @entity43 agents told @entity1 affiliate @entity45			1
one of those arrested with him -- on a marijuana trafficking charge , which was later dropped -- was @entity3 's mother , @entity49			1
corral was at the center of this week 's drama in the community of @entity54 , where two men toting handguns pried open her back door around 2 a.m. she hid in a closet with two of her children and their dog before the intruders realized where @entity49 and the children were hiding , and kicked in the door , according to the federal affidavit filed to support a complaint and arrest warrant against one of the suspects			1
the men demanded money and jewelry from @entity76 , but she refused			0
around that time , the dog @entity3 had been holding jumped out of her arms and began barking -- at which point one of the suspects shot the animal , who later died			2
@entity3 was eventually forced at gunpoint down the stairs , then eventually out the back door , over a fence , then behind several houses with the two kidnappers , an @entity83 agent wrote in the affidavit			2
and the men did not turn back when @entity49 went outside screaming her daughter 's name			0
later that morning , a man phoned @entity3 's family several times telling them that the 14 - year - old girl was unharmed , and making his demands			1
authorities were able to trace that phone to a man named @entity103			0
@entity103 's girlfriend later said she 'd loaned him a gray @entity106 she 'd rented , which was similar to one spotted by neighbors around the crime scene that tuesday morning , the federal affidavit said			2
the two kidnapping suspects pictured in sketched released this week by @entity83 investigators remain at large			2
but two others have been arrested in connection with the case : @entity39 and @entity103 , a 29 - year - old @entity0 man			0
@entity103 is being held on charges of conspiracy to kidnap a minor female			0
the criminal complaint alleges he used a cellular phone in commission of this crime : in fact , the affidavit ties him to two phones used around the abduction site			1
@entity39 , a 40 - year - old @entity126 national , is being held on immigration - related charges			0
authorities have n't detailed how these two men were arrested , beyond @entity132 police chief @entity131 saying it happened " through hardcore police work			0
" @entity131 focused more on the fact young teenager was unharmed , and back home			0
" this is a good day for the @entity139 family , but more importantly for @entity3 , " he said			2

new : an affidavit says @entity3 's family was called hours after abduction
new : authorities later tied cell phones linked to the crime to one suspect
he and another man , tied to a *reported* drug arrest involving @entity3 's mother , are detained
two other suspects in the kidnapping may still be at large
