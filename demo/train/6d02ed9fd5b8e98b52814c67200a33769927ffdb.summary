@entity0 -- in an unprecedented action , an @entity3 commander has stripped 17 of his officers of their authority to control and launch nuclear missiles			1
the 17 are being sent to undergo 60 to 90 days of intensive refresher training on how to do their jobs			1
the action comes after their unit performed poorly on an inspection and one officer was investigated for potential compromise of nuclear launch codes , according to lt. col. @entity19 , an @entity3 spokesman			1
the story was first reported by @entity21			0
the action was taken by the deputy commander of the @entity24 , lt. col. @entity23 , whose officers run launch control centers for the @entity28 nuclear missiles from @entity29 in @entity30			1
@entity23 announced the action in an emotionally charged april e-mail to his unit , saying in part , " did you know that we , as an operations group , have fallen -- and its it time to stand ourselves back up ? " in that e-mail , @entity23 said , " we 're discovering such rot in the crew force , " while they are on alert status -- standing watch over the nuclear force -- that the unit is accepting of violations of weapons safety rules , and code compromises			1
in words not often used by military officers , @entity23 told his troops to " crush any rules violators " and said , " we are , in fact , in a crisis right now			2
" @entity1 obtained a copy of the e-mail , which was also first obtained by the @entity21 @entity19 confirmed that @entity23 was referring to a potential deliberate violation of @entity3 rules regarding nuclear launch codes and the failure of his troops to report when they see potential violations			1
the @entity3 action affects only the 17 personnel deemed to need the training ; others remain on duty			1
the unit underwent a regular comprehensive inspection in march , according to @entity19			1
the inspection consisted of an evaluation of 22 tasks			2
at the time , the unit was announced as having passed with a " satisfactory " rating , which is third on a scale of five			0
but on one of the 22 tasks involving launch operations , it was rated " marginal " which is one step above " unsatisfactory			0
" @entity19 called it the equivalent of a " d " grade			0
then the incident of potential compromise of launch codes occurred			0
@entity19 said the investigation found no compromise , but did find the codes were " potentially handled improperly , " by one officer , who is now facing discipline			0
all of this then led to @entity23 ' e-mail and action , according to @entity19			0
@entity19 noted that while some in the @entity3 might view @entity23 ' e-mail as " emotional , " his actions are fully supported at the highest levels of the @entity3			1
in other portions of his e-mail @entity23 told his unit : -- " turn off the @entity100			0
" -- " clean your patches , uniforms and get your hair cut			0
" -- " bring to my attention immediately any officer who bad mouths a senior officer			0
" while some nuclear officers are sent for retraining every year , this is the most extensive action taken to date , @entity19 confirmed			2
it comes after a 2008 @entity114 report was sharply critical of the @entity3 for not focusing on the @entity116 nuclear mission , and for a bomber that , in a flight over multiple states , carried nuclear - tipped missiles without the @entity3 realizing it			2
@entity123 : ' outrage , disgust ' as @entity3 leader charged with sexual battery			2

seventeen officers will have to undergo up to 90 days of retraining
their unit performed poorly on an inspection , an @entity3 spokesman says
the @entity24 has " fallen , " its deputy commander says
