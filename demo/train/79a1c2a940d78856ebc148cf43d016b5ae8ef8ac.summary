@entity0 -- the @entity3 bombing was an all - too - familiar tragedy for @entity6 medic @entity5			1
in his line of work , he 's seen hundreds of similar attacks			1
" i wish i could have been there to help , " says beer , adding he happened to be in the area finishing up coursework at @entity13 and had taken a walk down @entity15 just the day before the incident			0
beer is founder of @entity20 , an all - volunteer rescue service in @entity6 , where emergencies are a way of life			1
friday in @entity0 , he powered onstage -- sirens blaring -- aboard one of his signature " ambu - cycles " ( an emergency - adapted motorcycle ) , stunning his audience at the @entity33			1
a featured speaker at @entity35 -- the annual conference that brings together medical professionals , scientists , researchers , educators , artists and athletes -- @entity5 's talk carried the provocative title : " how can we save 40,000 lives in under three minutes ? " he answered the question this way , " the average response time of a traditional ambulance is 12 to 15 minutes -- we reduce it to less than three minutes			1
our response is the fastest in the world			1
we call our approach a lifesaving flash mob			0
on motorcycles , traffic does n't stop us			0
" when seconds count " last year , @entity20 ( @entity59 for ' rescue ' ) treated 207,000 people -- more than 42,000 of them in life - threatening conditions , " says beer			1
" we got there in under three minutes and made a huge difference			1
" he leads a team of 2,000 skilled volunteers -- @entity68 who range professionally from " expensive lawyers to people who sell fish or shoes , " he says			1
@entity3 bombing heroes : running to help they make record time in a fleet of small cars , ambu - cycles , ambu - tractors and ambu - boats -- all equipped with heart defibrillators , breathing tubes , burn wraps and maternity kits			1
usually , they get there first , treating and stabilizing patients until ambulances arrive for transport			0
each volunteer handles an average of 60 calls a month			1
the service operates 24 hours a day , seven days a week , 365 days a year			2
beer 's innovative work stems from his own dreadful experience as a child			2
he was 6 years old when a terrorist bomb blew apart a @entity101 bus passing right in front of him			1
shocked , fearful and helpless , he fled the fiery scene where six people died and scores were injured			2
but he would not forget			0
" that day began a simple dream -- the dream of being able to save people from dying waiting for an ambulance , " reflects beer			2
as a teen , he bought two police scanners , then dropped out of high school to become a paramedic			0
in 1989 , he built the operation from the ground up , bucking bureaucracy , legal tangles and resistance from unions and existing emergency services			2
" this started with chutzpah			0
i was going to find a way around it			0
i did n't wait for authorization and stickers , " says beer			0
" we go , we do n't charge and we do n't require patients to have insurance			0
we do n't ask questions about ethnicity or religion -- it 's not about saving @entity136 or @entity137 , it 's about saving people			1
" @entity20 responders use a specially designed , state - of - the - art gps system called @entity141			2
" we are all connected with an app on our smartphones , " says beer			0
as calls come in , traffic - control navigators alert the first five responders closest to the scene			2
there are times volunteers tear out of their homes in the middle of the night and arrive onsite still wearing pajamas			0
" at first , huge monopolies saw us as hurting their business			0
what 's evolved is that they 've actually reduced prices because of us			1
their service got better because of us , " says beer			2
" now , we work closely with more than 100 ambulance companies in @entity6			1
they know we are there for them			0
we do n't replace ambulances -- we fill a gap			0
we send our people out to the scene			2
whenever the ambulances arrive , that 's fine			2
if there 's a patient we can save , we will be there to save them			2
" there is no shortage of volunteers			0
in fact , there is a waiting list to sign up for the organization 's 300 - hour training course			1
first responder 's emotional story " our volunteers are @entity136 and non-jews , @entity137 and @entity189 -- we help one another by saving lives , " says beer			1
he believes the reward of giving back is greater than any other form of payment			0
" @entity195 teaches when you save someone 's life , you 're actually saving the world , because you just saved the whole world for this one person and the generation to come			1
people want the satisfaction of being part of this -- and they sacrifice a lot to do that , " he says			2
now 39 and the father of five , @entity5 recalls the first time he saved a life			1
at age 16 , he treated a seriously injured man who had been struck by a car			2
the next day , he got a thank - you call from the man 's son			1
" best call i ever got in my life , " says beer			0
growing globally his life - saving ingenuity is gaining recognition			1
@entity20 has operations in @entity226 and @entity227 -- and plans to set up next year in @entity228			0
" this is something that is easy to adopt. anywhere i can go and share , i want to be there , " he says			0
beer notes that the hasidic jewish community in @entity237 has used the same technique ( traveling on emergency bikes or cycles ) for decades , successfully exporting the idea to other countries as well			0
the bombing this week in @entity244 reinforces what @entity5 learned the day he saw that first bus bombing as a boy -- every precious second counts			1
" we are fighting for each second to get there			0
seconds make the difference between life and death , " beer says			0
" a lifesaving flash mob sounds to me like the world 's next , greatest medical innovation , " @entity35 curator @entity257 said after @entity5 's talk			1
the next goal for @entity20 , which operates entirely on donations , is to cut response time in half			1
" how can we save 40,000 lives in just 90 seconds ? we all want to be heroes , " says beer			0
" we just need a few good ideas and a lot of chutzpah			0
