-- one of the mysteries of this administration is that president @entity3 is a great orator , but not always a great communicator , and we saw that dichotomy in effect again last night in @entity9			1
in a season of platitudes , his convention speech was admirably strong on policy specifics but weak on memorable themes			1
he made a values - driven case for continuing on a difficult path toward rebuilding the great @entity19 middle class , but did not offer new details on just how we would achieve those goals in the next four years			0
he successfully deconstructed the @entity24 plans as simply being more of the failed same -- " take two tax cuts , roll back some regulations , and call us in the morning ! " -- but did n't offer a strategy for how the two parties would work better together in a second term			1
and where @entity33 's speech was focused on centrist swing voters , president @entity3 's address seemed aimed at the party 's base , rocking the convention hall , but losing something in translation over television into living rooms across the nation			1
the speech contained some clear declarations of difference between the two parties			2
a close read showed @entity3 , as always , rhetorically refusing to accept old terms of debate : " we do n't think government can solve all our problems			1
but we do n't think that government is the source of all our problems			2
" instead , @entity3 sees a country balanced between rights and responsibilities , the individual and the community working together to make life a little better for us all			1
he believes passionately in the ability of government to make a positive difference -- and that is not socialistic , but realistic			0
@entity3 soared when talking about foreign policy , driving home the inexplicable failure of @entity68 to mention @entity69 in his @entity71 convention keynote			1
the paragraphs on @entity73 and the rebuilding of ground zero achieved elevation			0
the president ticked through a list of promises kept , offering data points on our decreased dependence on foreign oil over the past four years , and a goal of 1 million new manufacturing jobs by the end of his second term			2
he also belatedly embraced the recommendations of the @entity89 as a starting point to reduce the deficit and the debt , something he notably failed to do in his first term			0
but if this was a sober and serious address , it was also a refined version of his stump speech ; there was little new and no overarching narrative arc to make this high - stakes political speech truly stand out from the pack			1
the @entity105 said this would not be a @entity108 - style address , but there was a telltale laundry - list quality at times			2
both @entity111 and @entity33 -- and even possibly @entity112 ( ! ) -- offered more seamless inspiration speeches			0
in contrast , this felt like a speech written by committee			0
perhaps best that can be said of the speech , and this is not a small thing , is that president @entity3 spoke to the @entity19 people as adults last nights			1
he did not promise miracles , but instead steady improvement if we continued to work together , taking the nation in a better direction , one ironically more rooted in mid- 20th century values , but better suited to the inclusive reality of @entity19 life in the 21st century			1
it 's too soon to tell if any individual lines of this speech will endure			2
president @entity3 sometimes seems allergic to sound - bites as a point of pride			1
lines like " @entity140 ; saved @entity145 " roll off @entity112 's tongue , ready for a bumper sticker , but they almost seem too easy for the president and so the pitch is never hit			2
but the closing lines of the address achieved real momentum and encapsulated president @entity3 's argument : " @entity19 , i never said this journey would be easy , and i wo n't promise that now			1
yes , our path is harder , but it leads to a better place			0
yes our road is longer , but we travel it together			0
we do n't turn back			0
we leave no one behind			0
we pull each other up			0
we draw strength from our victories , and we learn from our mistakes , but we keep our eyes fixed on that distant horizon , knowing that providence is with us , and that we are surely blessed to be citizens of the greatest nation on @entity167			0
" or , as the new @entity169 anthem that closed out the convention more concisely said : " @entity171			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity174 .			2

@entity174 : president @entity3 's speech was strong on policy , weak on memorable themes
@entity3 deconstructed @entity24 positions well and *emphasized* edge on foreign policy , he says
@entity174 : it was a sober and serious address , and he did n't promise miracles
