-- on june 15 , president @entity1 described the @entity3 oil spill in a prime - time address as " the worst environmental disaster @entity6 has ever faced			1
" a government report released last week , however , said almost 75 percent of the oil that gushed from @entity9 's ruptured well into the @entity3 has been collected , dispersed or evaporated			1
the rest remains on or just below the surface of the water in the form of a light sheen or weathered tar balls			0
much of the remaining oil is " being degraded and cleaned up on the shore , " said @entity17 , head of the @entity18			2
" many of the doomsday scenarios that were talked about and repeated a lot have not and will not come to fruition , " @entity21 press secretary @entity20 has said			0
so was the oil spill really " the worst environmental disaster " in @entity6 history ? disasters are hard to rank and tricky to compare , historians say , but they cite several calamities that rival or surpass the @entity3 oil spill in terms of lives lost or affected			1
in 1889 , for example , a poorly maintained dam collapsed , sending a wall of water crashing through @entity37 , @entity38			2
the flood killed over 2,200 people and destroyed 1,600 homes			1
historians also cite what happened in blue - collar community of @entity45 , @entity46 , which was built atop more than 20,000 tons of chemical waste and linked to high rates of cancer and birth defects			0
hundreds of families were ultimately forced to flee			0
in terms of permanently disrupting a way of life for the largest number of @entity6 , historians say , nothing compares to the @entity58 , a slow - motion disaster sparked by years of shortsighted farming practices and serious drought			1
native grasses across the country 's heartland were torn up , leaving little to hold the topsoil in place			2
when the winds kicked up , dust storms turning the sky black could be seen as far away as @entity46			0
about 2.5 million people fled the @entity70 in one of the largest migrations in @entity6 history			1
that devastated the region 's agriculture economy			2
" the entire way of life of the @entity83 moved away from agriculture for a time , " said @entity79 , an environmental historian at @entity80			2
historians do not dispute the enormity of the damage caused by the @entity88 , which killed 11 people , bruised local and regional economies and caused damage that may not be apparent for years			2
it was " plainly the greatest oil spill disaster " in @entity6 history , according to @entity94 , director of programs for the @entity95 , a progressive advocacy group			1
nearly 206 million gallons of oil gushed into the @entity3 after an explosion sank @entity9 's @entity99 drilling rig in april , compared with 11 million gallons of crude that seeped from the @entity102 into @entity104 's @entity103 in 1989			1
the @entity102 spill was devastating , @entity79 said			2
the local ecosystem and fishing communities never fully recovered			0
yet " the use of dispersants , the formation of plumes deep under water , and the unique ecology of the @entity3 each make ( the @entity9 ) spill more disastrous , " he said			1
the @entity3 oil disaster ranks as the largest recorded maritime oil spill in @entity6 history -- and the largest accidental oil spill into water in world history , topped only by @entity122 's intentional release of 240 million gallons of oil into the @entity124 during the @entity125			1
in 1910 and 1911 , though , more oil spilled onto land in @entity128 as a result of the @entity130 , the consequence of a 1910 well explosion in @entity128 's @entity133			2
nearly 380 million gallons are believed to have spilled over nearly a year and a half			0
that spill , though , directly affected relatively few people and had " a less complicated ecological impact , " @entity79 said			2
so how does the @entity3 oil spill compare with the infamous 1889 @entity139 , an event memorialized in @entity6 songs and books ? the collapse of @entity143 sent about 20 million tons of water toward the @entity38 steel town , built on a flood plain between two rivers			1
it 's tough to compare @entity37 's broken dam with the @entity3 's broken oil well , but they 're similar in the sense that they 're both at least partly the product of a similar sense of ethics -- or lack thereof , @entity79 said			1
the 19th century robber barons behind the dam -- @entity159 and @entity160 -- ignored and did not properly maintain the dam , he said			0
@entity9 stands similarly accused of placing safety concerns behind financial considerations , an assertion the company has denied			0
" that 's a very good illustration of the ethics that predominated then and now , " @entity79 argued			0
" at times , big oil 's ethical culture is not too different from @entity159 's and @entity160 's , and it 's allowed to exist that way because we depend so much on big oil			2
" of course , the long - term impact of the @entity3 spill is still unknown			1
local residents can be optimistic because oil is a naturally occurring substance , @entity79 said			0
that means the region eventually will recover , though recovery may come too late for many businesses			0
one neighborhood that may never wholly recover : @entity45 -- now a synonym for environmental disaster in the @entity6			1
purchased from the @entity188 for $ 1 in 1953 , the community 's contaminated land was linked to unusually high cancer and birth defect rates , among other things			0
the federal government declared an emergency in the late 1970s as hundreds of families were forced to evacuate			0
the incident led to the passage of the @entity197 , designed to make polluters cover the costs of cleaning up contaminated areas			0
though the @entity203 declared @entity45 clean in 2004 , skepticism about its safety has lingered			0
fewer people may have been affected by @entity45 than by the @entity3 spill , but petroleum is " not quite as corruptive as the toxins were at @entity45 , " @entity79 said ; chemicals and radioactive materials can pose a potentially greater long term risk			1
the bottom line : it 's tough to rank environmental calamities			1
" we ca n't appreciate the magnitude of ( some disasters ) until their results and implications have had time to play out , " @entity79 said			0
" grand statements " such as @entity1 's " miss a very important point : this very bad situation resulted from doing business as usual in the petroleum industry			1
such events could occur any time the industry pursues such deep water wells as long as regulation is lax			0
" once something crosses a threshold of being a disaster , then it 's the worst one of that type in its own way , " he said			1
" the lesson should always be how can we prevent it from happening again			0

@entity1 declared the @entity3 oil @entity6 's " worst environmental disaster "
several calamities may rival or surpass the @entity3 spill in certain *respects* , *analysts* say
2.5 million people were displaced by the @entity70 ; over 2,200 were killed at @entity37
it may be *impossible* to rank environmental catastrophes , according to *experts*
