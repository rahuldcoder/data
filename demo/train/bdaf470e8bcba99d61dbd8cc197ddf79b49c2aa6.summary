-- i am an underdog in life			1
from the moment i entered the world , i was handed a collection of circumstances that most first world people would label as " disadvantages			1
" i grew up in a poor , single parent family			1
my dark features and @entity13 last name further complicated my @entity15 upbringing			1
i did n't look like anyone else ( including my mother )			1
racism , economic hardship , and familial struggles were my everyday reality from the beginning			1
but i am not the only underdog out there			1
maybe you or someone close to you also has underdog status			1
our individual stories are likely different , but the biographical details matter far less than the significant and perhaps surprisingly positive traits those obstacles have the power to nurture			2
ask someone who they are and how they got there , and many will begin by describing the hurdles they 've encountered -- the repeated rejection , the failed pursuits , the periods of scrimping			2
so much of how we understand ourselves is shaped by our losses and hardships , even more so than our victories			1
but as uncomfortable as they are , these personal roadblocks make us stronger and better than our more privileged selves			2
in @entity48 's new book , @entity49 : underdogs , @entity51 , and the art of @entity53 , he argues that being the underdog and experiencing disadvantages breeds " desirable difficulties			1
" but how much of what 's " desirable " is about perspective ? challenges do n't improve us merely because they exist			1
we have to reflect on them and proactively adapt their lessons into our life and work habits			2
the immense potential of these desirable difficulties is especially salient in the workplace			1

we 're less likely to take things ( and people ) for granted			1
once you 've felt the pangs of struggle , you do n't easily forget it , particularly if it 's experienced early in life			2
at work , this means underdogs are more likely to notice the little things and demonstrate appreciation			2
gratitude makes people happier , and since happiness is contagious , it also positively affects your coworkers			1
that does n't mean we 're all 24/7 bundles of cheer , but when you grow up without and have a desire for something better , you develop an inherent optimism and immunity to complacency			2
learning to do without demands creativity			2
underdogs are well - versed in the art of improvisation ; it 's necessary for our survival			2
last minute changes to a presentation ? an accelerated deadline ? if all other qualifications are relatively equal , i 'll choose the underdog to work on my team every time			1
underdogs spend their lives imagining " more , " which is invaluable in business			2
everyday improvisation leads to large - scale innovation , which transforms how we work and what we collectively produce			2

we are hyper - actively observant			2
when you 're an outsider , you vigilantly pay attention to what it takes to " fit in			0
" details and differences are not lost on underdogs			0
we quickly size up a situation and analyze how to optimize it			0
@entity127 is difficult to correct , and underdogs are aware by necessity -- a sort of " mindful compensation			0
" being an underdog does n't mean you 're a fraud when you do manage to find your way into more fortunate circles , but it does mean you had to become intimately familiar with the nuances of the rules to get there			1
this makes underdogs competitive players to watch ( and hire )			0
we are not risk averse			0
if you 've never had a safety net , then you feel like you do n't have much to lose			0
that does n't mean underdogs are inherently reckless , but it does bode well for taking calculated risks			0
being an entrepreneur , for instance , means you are likely to " fail " at some point -- but it also means you could score big eventually			0
and it 's not about luck ( though many will flippantly dismiss it as such ) , but rather perseverance , resilience , tenacity , and general strength of character that leads us to succeed			1
underdogs do n't take no for an answer and , perhaps counter-intuitively , tend to be very confident ( while arguably less arrogant ) -- because without that unbridled confidence , we would still be stuck in our previous reality			0
it takes a pretty serious belief in yourself to rise above those circumstances			0

if there 's one thing i know how to do , it 's hustle			0
with underdogs , the default answer is " yes			0
" yes , i can learn how to do that			0
yes , i can make that happen			0
yes , that is possible			0
will this can - do attitude backfire ? possibly , sometimes			0
but more often than not , that inner drive and hunger to excel means we 're willing to acquire new skills , push ourselves out of our comfort zone ( what comfort zone ? ) , and work toward goals with laser - sharp focus			0
being an underdog in life has shaped my character and my career , making me more successful and , ultimately , happier			1
but while being an underdog can make you pretty bad - ass in the workplace , let us not glamorize hardship			1
because make no mistake : it 's difficult			0
most of us would n't want to repeat the past , and we diligently strive for a better future with fewer difficulties for our offspring			1
and yet , i for one would not change the personal challenges i 've been dealt			0
underdog status is what you make of it			1
it 's not a label i 'm looking to overcome			0
it 's a permanent state of being for me			0
it reminds me everyday what it took to get where i am , how much i have to be grateful for , and how much room i still have to grow			0
being an underdog is n't a plea for sympathy			1
it 's an invitation to triumph			0
