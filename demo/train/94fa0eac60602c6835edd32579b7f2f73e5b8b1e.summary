-- a little good , a little bad and a whole lot of nostalgia were in play at the @entity6 's " @entity9 " reunion in @entity7 , @entity8 , on monday			1
it 's been 35 years since the ' 80s sitcom , about four boarding school girls and their house mother , debuted as a spinoff from " @entity15			0
" although " @entity9 " has been in reruns since 1988 , an upcoming @entity17 release brought the series ' stars together again			1
@entity21 , who played @entity22 , joined @entity23 ( @entity24 ) , @entity25 ( @entity26 ) and @entity27 ( mrs. @entity28 ) at the reunion event			1
@entity30 , who 'll always be known as @entity31 to some , made an appearance via video			0
the sitcom still has plenty of fans ( and the theme song can still get stuck in your head after one listen ) , but the stars of the series do n't think " @entity9 " would work on the air today			1
during the panel , @entity45 said the networks would probably pass on a show with a lesson in every episode , while @entity27 thinks it could be updated			0
and the religious @entity23 , who says she would n't let her character lose her virginity on the show , is pretty sure " @entity9 " could happen today ... if it were handled very differently			1
maybe " if we were all naked , " @entity23 joked			1
the cast was just as wholesome off - set as they were in front of the camera			2
in fact , there was just one cast member who affected life on set with an addiction problem : @entity27			2
the older actress ' smoking habit apparently drove the cast crazy			2
" the girls did n't want me to smoke , " @entity27 said			0
" i used to smoke five cigarettes a day , and they 'd pull them out of my mouth			0
" but @entity27 , who let some profanity slip while on stage during the reunion , reminded the crowd that she 's not mrs. @entity28			2
@entity78 , who played @entity79 on the show , also made an appearance with the cast			2
@entity78 , who has cerebral palsy , was the first person with a disability to be featured on a tv series , and she credits the show with changing her life			1
" that first episode was so special to me , " she said			0
" it was a dream come true			0
" @entity78 was n't the only actor to get a break on " @entity9			1
" the show had a long list of notable guest stars , and the list of unknown actors who later achieved success is just as impressive			0
it includes @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 and some other guy who has done ok for himself , @entity107			0
the cast said @entity107 has come a long way since the days when he and @entity21 sported similar mullets			0
but he may not have left much of an impression , as @entity23 said she has to refer to @entity112 to recall an onscreen kiss she and @entity107 shared			1
" i am all for repressed memories , " @entity23 joked , " but why i repressed that one , i do n't know ! "			1

most of the cast of " @entity9 " reunited on monday
the reunion was held at the @entity6 in *support* of an upcoming @entity17 release
the stars *discussed* whether the series could work on tv today
@entity23 thought it could only if it were more *risque*
