explaining his thoughts at the time , he said : " the sport has changed a lot and it has changed to the point where i am not enjoying it			0

" before i came here , i was expecting to struggle more , " @entity64 told @entity84			0
" from the tv , this circuit looked so tricky			0
" at the beginning with a full fuel tank , i was a little bit scared			0
i 'm very , very happy because it 's a new circuit and i 've got 25 points			0
