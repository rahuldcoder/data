@entity1 's capuchin monkey -- famously seized by @entity3 customs officials after the singer brought it on tour without the right paperwork -- is now out of quarantine and about to join a new " family " in a @entity3 zoo			1
the young monkey , @entity12 , was taken to a @entity14 animal shelter after he was confiscated at the end of march as @entity1 arrived in @entity3 on tour			1
but the capuchin has now been transferred to the @entity17 in @entity18 , near @entity19 in northern @entity3 , to start life with his new family -- six other capuchin monkeys			1
@entity12 was transferred wednesday to the zoo 's new monkey area , consisting of a tree - covered island -- dubbed " @entity28 " -- surrounded by a moat and equipped with a house for its seven residents			2
he 's the first to arrive on the island and the others will be introduced gradually , if all goes according to plan , zoo spokeswoman @entity32 told @entity35			0
the other capuchins are three males and three females , one of whom was born around the same time as @entity12 and is known as @entity41 , @entity32 said			0
@entity1 in accident involving pedestrian while in quarantine , for several weeks at the animal shelter and another month at the zoo , the monkey clung to a stuffed toy thought to have been given to him by @entity1			2
but the zoo is confident he 'll adjust to his new life quickly , @entity32 said			0
" he is very clever and he 's the right age , not too old " to fit in , she said			0
@entity1 had until may 7 to present the right paperwork to reclaim his pet -- who 's now 27 weeks old and weighs a little less than three pounds -- but failed to do so , @entity32 said			1
as a result , @entity12 is now the property of the @entity3 government , and the @entity17 is acting as a caretaker for the creature			0
the park was picked because it was the only zoo in @entity3 that had a family of capuchins for @entity12 to join			1
@entity1 had better slow down , neighbors say the zoo contacted the pop star 's management to tell it about @entity12 's new home but did not receive a response , @entity32 said			1
she does n't anticipate a visit from the pop star to the zoo			0
so far @entity1 's fans , known for their devotion to the 19 - year - old singer , have not been rushing to the @entity17 , but some questions have been posted on @entity79 and the zoo 's website , she added			1
@entity1 's representatives declined to comment at the time the animal was confiscated			2
@entity84 of the animal shelter told @entity35 in april that the monkey was " not distressed " but was too young to have been taken from his mother			0
@entity12 was about 14 weeks old when he was brought to the shelter , and would have been only about 9 weeks old when he was reportedly given to @entity1 in march , @entity84 said .			0
