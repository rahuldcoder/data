it can be exhausting nursing a child through a nasty bout with the flu , so imagine how 22 - year - old @entity4 felt nursing her entire family through @entity6			1
@entity4 took care of them all , single - handedly feeding them , cleaning them and giving them medications			1
and she did so with remarkable success			2
three out of her four patients survived			0
that 's a 25 % death rate -- considerably better than the estimated @entity6 death rate of 70 %			1
@entity4 stayed healthy , which is noteworthy considering that more than 300 health care workers have become infected with @entity6 , and she did n't even have personal protection equipment -- those white space suits and goggles used in @entity6 treatment units			1
instead @entity4 , who 's in her final year of nursing school , invented her own equipment			1
international aid workers heard about @entity4 's " trash bag method " and are now teaching it to other @entity33 who ca n't get into hospitals and do n't have protective gear of their own			1
every day , several times a day for about two weeks , @entity4 put trash bags over her socks and tied them in a knot over her calves			1
then she put on a pair of rubber boots and then another set of trash bags over the boots			1
she wrapped her hair in a pair of stockings and over that a trash bag			2
next she donned a raincoat and four pairs of gloves on each hand , followed by a mask			1
it was an arduous and time - consuming process , but @entity4 was religious about it , never cutting corners			1
@entity59 spokeswoman @entity58 said @entity4 is amazing			1
" essentially this is a tale of how communities are doing things for themselves , " @entity58 said			0
" our approach is to listen and work with communities and help them do the best they can with what they have			0
" two doctors for 85,000 people she emphasized , of course , that it would be better for patients to be in real hospitals with doctors and nurses in protective gear -- it 's just that those things are n't available to many @entity82			0
no one knows that better than @entity4			1
her @entity6 nightmare started juy 27 , when her father , @entity85 , had a spike in blood pressure			1
she took him to a hospital in their home city of @entity91			0
a bed was free because a patient had just passed away			0
what no one realized at the time was that the patient had died of @entity6			1
one woman walked in , and the @entity6 nightmare began @entity85 , 52 , developed a fever , vomiting and diarrhea			2
then the hospital closed down because nurses started dying of @entity6			2
@entity4 took her father to @entity106 , the capital city , about a 90 - minute drive via difficult roads			2
three hospitals turned him away because they were full			0
she took him back to another hospital in @entity91			0
they said he had typhoid fever and did little for him , so @entity4 took him home , where he infected three other family members : @entity4 's mother , @entity116 , 57 ; @entity4 's sister , @entity118 , 28 , and their 14 - year - old cousin who was living with them , @entity122			1
guilty of @entity6 until proven otherwise while operating her one - woman ebola hospital for two weeks , @entity4 consulted with their family doctor , who would talk to her on the phone , but would n't come to the house			1
she gave them medicines she obtained from the local clinic and fluids through intravenous lines that she started			0
at times , her patients ' blood pressure plummeted so low she feared they would die			0
" i cried many times , " she said			0
" i said ' @entity138 , you want to tell me i 'm going to lose my entire family ? ' " but her father , mother , and sister rallied and were well on their way to recovery when space became available at @entity147 on august 17			2
@entity122 never recovered , though , and passed away at the hospital the next day			0
" i 'm very , very proud , " her father said			0
" she saved my life through the almighty @entity138			0
" now he 's working to find a scholarship for @entity4 so she can finish her final year of nursing school			2
he has no doubt his daughter will go on to save many more people during her life			0
" i 'm sure she 'll be a great giant of @entity157 , " he said			0
@entity6 patients left to lay on the ground			2

@entity4 , 22 , nursed four family members infected with @entity6
@entity4 protected herself using trash bags , rubber boots , gloves and a mask
her protection method is being taught to others in @entity170
