@entity0 -- aviation authorities around the world ordered airlines to stop flying their @entity5 over fire risk associated with battery failures aboard the highly touted aircraft			1
groundings that extended globally on thursday stemmed from a @entity12 @entity11 directive on wednesday night that planes should not fly until the problems are resolved			1
the action resulted from recent mechanical and other glitches culminating with a severe battery related fire aboard an empty @entity19 in @entity20 10 days ago and an emergency landing in @entity22 this week prompted by an alarm indicating smoke in an electrical compartment			1
" the battery failures resulted in release of flammable electrolytes , heat damage , and smoke on two @entity32 airplanes , " the @entity11 said in a statement			0
" the root cause of these failures is currently under investigation			2
these conditions , if not corrected , could result in damage to critical systems and structures , and the potential for fire in the electrical compartment , " the @entity11 said			2
in all , authorities in @entity44 , @entity22 and @entity45 have grounded the planes while the battery problem is investigated			1
carriers in @entity49 and @entity50 also set down their 787s until further notice			0
@entity53 is the only @entity12 carrier to operate the @entity19			1
the carrier said it would work with the @entity11 on its directive			2
it inspected its fleet of six 787s after the @entity20 fire			1
the marquee and technologically advanced 787 is widely viewed as crucial to the future of the world 's biggest aircraft manufacturer			2
the @entity19 order book is very strong even though the plane had years of embarrassing setbacks and cost overruns during development			0
the first commercial dreamliner flight took off in october 2011 , flying from @entity67 to @entity68 , and the planes flew without major problems for months			0
but @entity5 's most recent problems with the plane extended beyond battery technology , global safety regulators , canceled service and a steady stream of negative publicity			1
the company 's shares on @entity80 are sharply lower as well			0
growing list of problems most problems have been considered fixable and described as growing pains for a new airliner			0
but these experts say any battery system design problem would raise larger issues for the manufacturer , carriers and travelers			0
dreamliners fly 150 flights daily worldwide , @entity5 said			1
@entity94 : dreamliner problems explained since july , the growing list of reported troubles aboard the planes include a fuel leak , an oil leak , two cracked engines , a damaged cockpit window and a battery problem			1
the @entity11 announced a safety review of the aircraft last week before taking stricter action on wednesday			0
in the most serious incident so far , an @entity108 ( @entity108 ) 787 with 129 people aboard made an emergency landing after a battery alarm on wednesday			1
those aboard reported a burning smell in the cabin , and an alarm indicated smoke in a forward electrical compartment			0
hours later , @entity108 and @entity117 announced that they were grounding their @entity5 -- a total of 24 planes -- pending an investigation			1
@entity22 authorities followed suit , saying the planes should stay on the ground until battery safety could be assured			1
the head of @entity45 's civil aviation regulator , @entity128 , also asked @entity129 to halt operation of its six @entity5 for the time being			1
the @entity133 said it , too , had adopted the @entity11 directive , which applies to the two 787s flown by the @entity136 carrier lot			0
@entity137 also announced it was temporarily grounding four @entity5 , according to regional manager @entity138			1
it has had no issues with its 787s but is following the @entity11 directive as " an extra precautionary safety measure and in line with its commitment of putting safety above all else , " the company later said in a statement			1
@entity49 - based @entity147 said it was temporarily grounding its three @entity5 aircraft and @entity149 was also putting down its fleet of five @entity5			1
@entity5 confident planes are safe @entity5 chief executive officer @entity152 said in a statement on wednesday the manufacturing giant is confident that the planes are safe and is working with authorities to get them flying again			1
" @entity5 is committed to supporting the @entity11 and finding answers as quickly as possible , " the statement said			2
@entity152 did not mention specifics about the recent incidents , but said the company " deeply regrets the impact that recent events have had on the operating schedules of our customers and the inconvenience to them and their passengers			0
" the batteries are critical to the plane because the 787 is thirsty for electrical power			2
the @entity19 uses electricity to run more systems than any other @entity5 airliner , said @entity175 professor @entity174 , an aircraft electrical and computer engineer who spent time observing @entity19 development at @entity5 's @entity179 headquarters			2
the 787 is unique because its batteries are lithium - ion batteries			0
these hold more energy for longer periods than the standard nickel cadmium airliner batteries			0
" these kinds of batteries , " @entity174 says , " are slightly more likely to cause problems			0
" although lithium batteries heat up quickly because of their structure , they have systems and circuits in place to prevent overheating , said @entity197 , a spokesman for @entity198			0
the @entity22 company supplies batteries for @entity5			1
@entity200 expected to take weeks the investigation will take several weeks , the company said			2
@entity5 has delivered 50 @entity5 so far and has more than 800 additional orders from airlines around the world			1
carriers who have ordered planes but are still awaiting delivery , like @entity209 of @entity210 and @entity211 in the @entity212 , expressed confidence that the problems would be sorted out by the time they received the planes			0
@entity5 's shares , which had previously been resilient in the face of this month 's negative publicity over the @entity19 , sank another 2 % on thursday			2
after last week 's incident in @entity20 , @entity5 chief engineer @entity221 expressed confidence in the aircraft 's battery system			1
" i am 100 % convinced the airplane is safe to fly , " he said			2
" i fly on it all the time			0
" longtime commercial pilot and industry analyst @entity228 said the battery issue did not appear to be a major problem , but called the @entity11 order " a positive and pro-active step			0
" " i do n't think that it was dangerous for the plane to be flying , but it probably was n't the best thing to be flying it on the heels of this latest emergency landing in @entity22 , " @entity228 said			1
" all airplanes have their teething problems , and this was trending in a bad direction , " he added			0
" now the authorities have said , ' stop , ' and that 's a good thing			0
" @entity1 's @entity246 , @entity247 , @entity248 , @entity249 , @entity250 , @entity251 and @entity252 contributed to this report			0
@entity255 's @entity254 and journalist @entity256 also contributed to this report .			0
