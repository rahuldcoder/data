-- the president of @entity4 's @entity3 region , @entity1 , signed a decree on saturday setting november 9 as the date for a referendum on independence			1
however , the federal government in @entity10 is staunchly opposed to any such referendum and says it is unconstitutional , setting the stage for legal and political confrontation and potential civil disobedience			1
the holding of @entity17 's independence referendum earlier this month buoyed other separatist movements around the world , despite @entity17 voters opting to remain part of the @entity22			1
@entity1 , at the signing ceremony in @entity24 , said that @entity3 wants to speak , wants to be heard and wants to vote			2
on september 11 , @entity27 national day , hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of @entity24 for the third year running demanding a vote on independence be held			1
but @entity10 argues that @entity3 , which represents one fifth of @entity4 's economy , already has broad home - rule powers , including its own parliament , police force and control over education and health			2
and it insists that the @entity4 @entity39 does not allow any of @entity4 's 17 regions to unilaterally break away			0
the government in @entity10 is expected to try to block the vote in @entity4 's constitutional court			1
if the court accepts the case , as is widely expected , it would automatically suspend the vote -- leaving @entity3 to decide whether to try to go ahead with it			0
prime minister @entity49 , speaking at a news conference earlier this month , dismissed any idea of the referendum taking place			1
" quite simply , it is not legal so wo n't be held , " he said			0
" in addition to not being legal , it goes against our whole history and our feelings , against what the vast majority of the @entity4 people think , against our past and against the future of the @entity4 people that live in @entity3 and in the rest of @entity4			2
" earlier this month , one of @entity3 's key political figures , @entity69 , leader of the @entity71 -- or @entity72 -- party , said if the government in @entity10 were to block citizens ' exercising their " fundamental right " to vote , there could be a need for civil disobedience			1
those in the crowd in @entity24 earlier this month said that if @entity10 blocked the referendum , people should still deposit their ballots			2
a long list of grievances against @entity10 center on taxation and language issues			0
a referendum is expected to ask a two - part question : " should @entity3 be a state ? " and those who vote yes to that can then go to vote on the second question : " should that state be independent ? " polls indicate that a majority of @entity27 want to have a chance to vote but that less than a majority would vote for independence , given the chance			1
those calling for independence in @entity24 earlier this month did not represent all the region 's 7.5 million people			0
a smaller gathering of several thousand took to the streets the same day in @entity3 's second largest city , @entity108 , calling for the region to remain a part of @entity4			0
one of those protesters told @entity0 : " the reason we want to remain a part of @entity4 , is because we are a part of @entity4			0
" @entity0 's @entity116 contributed to this report .			0

@entity27 president @entity1 sets november 9 as the date for an independence referendum
the federal government in @entity10 is *firmly* opposed to any such vote taking place
hundreds of thousands of demonstrators called earlier this month for a vote to be held
but opinion polls suggest that less than a majority would opt for a split from @entity4
