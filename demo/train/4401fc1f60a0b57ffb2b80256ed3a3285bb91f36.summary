-- the holidays have arguably come early for armchair disc jockeys , who can scratch along with exclusive musical mash - ups of songs by popular artists in remix simulator " @entity7			1
" supporting two turntables and a plastic microphone , additional freestyle tricks and an expanded single - player career mode , the sequel to last year 's popular rhythm game also enjoys a healthy co-sign from rapper and actor @entity15			1
" the game is exciting , brings good music to the forefront and captures the real @entity22 aesthetic , " he says in a recent interview			0
" i love that two players can go head - to - head , and the freestyle aspect is really cool			1
... you have a microphone you can sing into and you can scratch at your own pace			2
when you play it , you feel just like you 're at a party			0
" while no substitute for actual spinning @entity15 says it 's a reasonable starting point for beginners looking to immerse themselves in dj culture			1
even more important than letting players live the dance - floor dream , he says , is that games like this can help introduce modern fans to classic artists			1
" people today might not be watching as much tv or listening to music , " he told @entity0			0
" but even when people are n't buzzing about a hot new track , they 're still playing these games and hearing our songs			2
as an artist , everything you do is a brick you have to build on			0
getting a song in a video game is a major stepping stone , and way to get introduced to new audiences			2
" a fan of classic titles like " @entity61 , " " @entity62 " and " ms. @entity63 " before giving the controller a temporary rest , @entity15 also says that motion - sensing video games are making former arcade enthusiasts take notice again			1
these so - called " active " games are a great way to grab people 's attention , says common , adding that he 's not surprised they 're such high - tech sensations			1
" music games are making a comeback this year , " he says			1
" these titles are constantly improving , the music gets more exciting and more people are being attracted to them			0
" part of the appeal , he says , is that they fit right into nearly any social setting , especially parties , and are as fun to watch and listen to as actively play			0
high - profile releases like " @entity7 " and recent karaoke outing " @entity88 , " show hip - hop finally getting some respect from game makers			2
" [ the genre ] would 've been much bigger today if we 'd had games like this early on			2
" he says he secretly yearns to do a " @entity7 " track with @entity98 -- " you 'd have to speed her up or something " -- and says he plays the game with producer @entity100 during studio downtime			0
should new album " @entity106 , " due @entity107 , get pushed back , you 'll know why			0
" no , we do n't plan on any delays , " he says with a laugh .			0
