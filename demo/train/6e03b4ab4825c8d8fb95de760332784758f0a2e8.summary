-- a @entity4 man was on probation when he was arrested then released for public intoxication , hours after which he allegedly killed a roman catholic priest in a church rectory			1
the terms of slaying suspect @entity11 's probation -- which were for three years tied to a november 2012 arrest for cocaine possession -- did not mandate that he should have remained behind bars after his arrest in southern @entity17 , @entity4 , on @entity18			1
but had he stayed in custody , or if @entity22 police officers detained him again after being tipped off about a suspicious man shortly after his release at the coastal city 's @entity25 , the gruesome story may have turned out differently			1
instead , around 9 a.m. on wednesday , @entity28 , church staff alerted police after finding the rev. @entity31 's body			0
@entity22 police chief @entity32 said later that officers and a doctor , who also was a parishioner , soon determined that @entity31 was dead , having suffered " blunt force trauma " in what he described as a " violent struggle			0
" @entity39 and other records obtained friday by @entity0 did not hint at any violent crimes in @entity43 's history			1
but they do shed light on some of his life , including speeding tickets , the fact he has at least three daughters , bankruptcy filings and the aforementioned cocaine arrest			1
he pleaded guilty to a controlled substance charge on the latter matter , leading to the probation			1
@entity0 's efforts on friday to reach the lawyer who represented @entity43 in this case were unsuccessful			1
@entity43 's was a relatively low - level probation : it did not mean he should remain detained were he ever arrested on any charge , lt. @entity62 of the @entity63 said			1
@entity17 's chief probation officer , @entity66 , said @entity43 's case never fell under his department , and as such @entity43 did n't have to do things like check in regularly with a probation officer			1
the @entity39 document outlining @entity43 's probation specifies that he would be in violation if he was found to have " any nonprescribed controlled substance			1
" but the guidelines specifically do not include things like prohibiting the violation of any " criminal statutes ; " possession , custody or control of any alcohol ; or " aggressive or assaultive behavior toward any person			2
" these facts are relevant , given @entity43 's interaction with authorities in the hours before @entity31 's death			1
according to @entity22 police , the 43 - year - old was " acting strangely " when he was picked up by county sheriff 's deputies in @entity94			0
they took him to a jail where " he was rejected due to his erratic behavior , " then moved him to a nearby hospital " where he became more agitated and had to be physically restrained by deputies , " police added			2
@entity62 , from the sheriff 's office , said @entity43 was sent to a hospital because of a high heart rate			1
he was eventually booked into a jail shortly after 4:30 p.m. that day , staying there for more than eight hours before his release at 12:43 a.m. on january 1			1
less than two hours later , police got a call about a suspicious person at @entity25			2
officers found @entity43 , but because he was n't " intoxicated and did not qualify for an emergency psychological hold , " they did n't detain him			1
instead , they referred him to a shelter , @entity114 said			0
chief : police want to know why slaying happened at some point later , a guard at @entity25 found a person matching @entity43 's description on the premises and told him to leave , police said			1
then came the devastating discovery of @entity31 's body			0
the slain priest 's 2010 @entity128 hybrid was gone			2
@entity43 apparently drove 45 minutes from the parish to a family member 's house in that car , police said			2
one of @entity43 's relatives eventually tipped off police to his whereabouts , leading to his arrest midday thursday , according to the @entity22 police chief			1
" there 's no question in our mind he 's responsible for this heinous act , " @entity114 said , citing evidence recovered at the crime scene and interviews with witnesses that allegedly link @entity43 to the priest 's death			1
the chief added : " to me , ' why ' is the biggest thing that we would like to establish -- to bring a sense of ease and comfort to the community , " @entity114 said			0
that community -- including members of @entity162 , students and staff at @entity165 where @entity31 taught , and residents throughout greater @entity22 -- was still hurting friday , as it tried to make sense of the violent death of the popular priest			2
" @entity31 knew as well as anybody just how senseless violence could be , " said @entity170 , a professor at @entity165			0
" when a fine person like him is brought down -- that 's just tragic			0
" since 2007 , @entity31 had taught about the @entity176 at that public university , where he also had a leadership role in the @entity179 for @entity181 students			2
he developed a reputation there for his warmth as much as his scholarly expertise , which made him popular on campus			0
" @entity187 is the word that comes to mind , sensitive			0
" said professor @entity189 , the chairman of @entity165 's religious studies department			0
" ... he was very much someone that you could sit down and speak with			0
... he connected with everybody			0
" but his primary calling was as a priest			0
@entity31 had been part of @entity4 's @entity198 diocese since 1999 , establishing himself as a " great preacher " and an engaging teacher from his work in catholic schools , said monsignor @entity203			2
@entity204 said he and other @entity25 parishioners are shocked and angered by @entity31 's death , especially given how it happened			0
" it 's hard to feel @entity209 because ... it was brutal , " @entity204 said , adding that @entity31 was " very jovial ... very accessible ( and ) very loving			0
" " we lost a pastor , we lost a friend and , for many of us , he was like a father figure			0
" @entity0 's @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 and @entity219 contributed to this report .			0

he pleaded guilty to cocaine possession tied to a 2012 arrest , got three years probation
it was n't the type of probation that should have kept him detained , *lieutenant* says
authorities say @entity43 killed a @entity4 priest hours after his release from jail
