@entity0 -- photographer @entity2 walks into the @entity4 building in @entity0 with his photos under his arm			1
they 're pictures of elderly women , part of his exhibit that was scheduled to take place at the @entity4 gallery			1
that is , until @entity4 canceled it without explanation			2
it 's not the quality of his work that 's the problem , says @entity2 , but the content			1
@entity2 's photographs are portraits of the @entity25 women known as comfort women , victims who were forcibly taken from @entity28 and used as sex slaves for @entity31 soldiers during @entity32			1
now 80 to 90 years old , they 're the living but dwindling history of the decades - old war crimes			2
some @entity31 extremists believe the crimes against the comfort women never happened			1
others would prefer to stop discussing @entity31 's ugly war history in modern times			1
@entity2 knocks on the door of the @entity4 gallery manager 's office			1
a middle - aged man opens the door			0
the gallery manager knows who @entity2 is and asks him to wait			2
" in the beginning i was angry and frustrated , " says @entity2 , referring to receiving the notice that his exhibit was canceled , as he waits outside the manager 's door			1
" but this is not a matter of being angry			0
i believe there is a problem with the @entity31 government			2
they 're discriminating against the comfort women			1
" the letter @entity2 received did n't state why the exhibition was canceled , and while @entity4 told @entity1 that public complaints had been lodged before its planned opening , a representatives said that was n't the reason the exhibition was pulled			1
@entity2 's pictures are emotional but do n't appear to make a political statement about the @entity31			1
in one portrait , a woman appears to be crying			0
her face is deeply lined , her back slouched with age , her hands spotted with freckles			0
the picture is black and white , carrying a timelessness that betrays the endless grief the woman carries			0
it is just one of dozens of portraits of the elderly , poverty - stricken @entity25 women , quietly living out their twilight years in rural @entity88			1
" the reason i do this work is for these grandmothers , " says @entity2			2
" the government and some @entity31 people just hope these women will die and history will be erased			2
" @entity31 has a track record of downplaying its war crimes			2
most recently , @entity31 's government says two delegations met with the mayor of @entity102 , @entity103 , asking the city to remove a memorial dedicated to comfort women			1
the city says the @entity31 officials offered cherry blossom trees if the city would take down the memorial , a small , unremarkable rock that has a single bronze etching on the side			2
the city says it refused the offer			0
@entity31 's government would not confirm it offered @entity102 any gift in exchange for the removal of the memorial			1
the move , widely reported through the @entity25 community , reopened old wounds			0
" they think it 's an @entity130 monument , trying to attack @entity31 , but it 's not , " says @entity124 , staff attorney for the @entity126 , based in @entity127			2
" we do n't want to repeat that kind of massive , government - organized human trafficking			0
the only way we can stop that kind of human rights violation is remembering that human rights violation			0
the best way to remember it is to have a memory of it			0
" @entity25 activists say @entity31 needs to accept and properly acknowledge its war crimes instead of trying to eradicate its history			1
the @entity102 effort backfired on @entity31 , says @entity146			0
" their request was helpful for our movement			0
it 's helping us to do more things for the comfort women issue			1
many more communities now want to have memorials in their communities			0
" @entity31 's government has formally apologized on numerous occasions for the atrocities against the women			1
@entity31 helped establish the @entity161 in 1995 , which is supported by government funds and provides assistance to comfort women			1
the @entity161 has received donations from @entity31 people equaling us $ 7 million			0
@entity31 has resisted direct payments to individual victims , leading to complaints among activists and victims that the country appears to be avoiding officially acknowledging its history			0
the lack of direct reparations continues to support a culture of discrimination against the women , say activists			0
that 's why @entity2 believes @entity4 could so easily cancel his photographic memorial to the women			1
@entity4 's gallery manager reappears out of his office and tells @entity2 his exhibit remains canceled			1
he wo n't explain why			0
he had hoped to teach young @entity31 people about their history and challenge them to reconcile it			0
" these grandmothers were forced into slavery 70 years ago , " says @entity2			2
" they lived and survived alone			0
afterwards , no one remembers them			0
" @entity2 gathers his pictures and heads to the gallery 's exit			2
" will they be blown away in a bleak wind and dispersed and vanished to the back stage of history ? "			0
