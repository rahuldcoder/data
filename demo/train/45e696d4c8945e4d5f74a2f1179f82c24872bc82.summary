on @entity0 -- on friday morning , i boarded a leaky oyster boat in @entity4 with a captain who ca n't swim			1
our destination : @entity8 , 84 miles down the coast			0
mission : do n't drown get world leaders to act on climate change			1
if anyone can accomplish that herculean task it should be @entity16 , a 42 - year - old oysterman off the coast of @entity18 , @entity4 , who has become a sort of reluctant poster boy for doing something about the crisis instead of just talking about it			1
@entity16 's oyster beds were wiped out twice by hurricanes , once by @entity27 and then , a year later , by @entity28			1
warming waters and ocean acidification are n't helping his business model , either			2
but instead of giving up , he 's currently helping to pioneer new techniques for " ocean farming , " growing , among other things , kelp seaweed for use in pasta , martinis and biofuel			1
that he ca n't swim has n't stopped him from spending his life on the ocean , which he loves			2
( " the world disappears ; it does n't exist when you 're out here , " he said , bouncing over 3 - and 4 - foot waves )			0
and that he , single - handedly , ca n't stop climate change did n't stop him from driving his boat down the coast to attend the @entity51 's @entity50 in @entity52 on sunday , which is being billed as the largest public demonstration for climate action to date			1
" this is n't a shtick			0
i actually believe in this , " he said of the reason he 's boating from @entity4 to @entity52 for the rally			1
" i love the ocean			2
i want to protect it			0
" @entity16 -- who described himself as being " on the front lines of the this crisis " -- will be one of the most important people to attend sunday 's @entity65 , which is expected to draw more than 100,000 protestors ahead of @entity68 climate summit on tuesday			1
he 's essential to the international climate conversation for two reasons			1
@entity71 , he 's a witness to the reality of climate change today -- here and now and in @entity74			1
too often we think of this as an @entity78 - only problem , or a 100 - years - in - the - future problem			0
it 's actually both urgent and local , as @entity16 and so many others can attest			1
and two : instead of just griping about the changes , he 's actually doing something to help			2
" this is n't a story of giving up , " he said			0
" this is a story of hope			0
we all have a lot to learn from @entity16			1
opinion : why climate change is an ' everybody issue ' now i was lucky enough to get to join him and his co-conspirator , @entity96 , 52 , on the 7Â½ - hour journey from the @entity98 , near @entity18 , @entity4 , to pier 59 in the @entity100 neighborhood of @entity8			1
we took @entity16 's 1983 workboat , which he calls " @entity102 , " named for the @entity104 ' legendary @entity103			1
it chugged along , past the mansions of @entity107 , @entity4 , and the industrial decay of @entity109 , at a steady and slightly sea - sickening pace of about 17 mph			1
he told me he took the boat instead of a car because traffic on @entity114 headed into @entity52 is " f --- ing hell " and because it 's a fun bit of " political theater , " inspired in part by 1970s protests in which farmers drove their tractors across the country to @entity122 to demand better farm policy			1
between bouts of losing our footing and hollering over the wind , i got to learn some of @entity16 's inspirational story			1
he grew up in in @entity129 , @entity130 , a fishing village with 14 houses , as he tells it , at " the edge of the world			0
" his parents were from @entity52 and @entity4 , but moved there during the @entity136 to dodge the draft			1
their son took to the tiny village well , and started fishing at a young age			0
because it was so remote , he said , it was a place where people were " fascinated with everything new			0
" it was a place of doers and makers , not complainers			0
@entity16 's parents later moved him to the @entity149 area			1
people sat around too much , and he missed being out on the ocean -- subject to its moods , humbled by its strength			2
so , at 14 , he dropped out and went to work as a commercial fishermen -- first in @entity156 , then on the @entity157 , where he saw 60 - foot waves			0
he dreamed about the work even when he was n't doing it -- fell in love with a life lived out on the water			0
it was so cold , he said , he never bothered to learn to swim			0
that 's not uncommon among fishermen , he told me			2
the prevailing view : swimming prolongs drowning			0
he 's no stranger to ecological catastrophe			2
he witnessed the collapse of cod populations in the @entity174 , which he said put many of his friends out of work			0
and then , when he 'd established himself as an oysterman on @entity0 , the hurricanes came			0
while scientists say it 's impossible to attribute any single storm to human - induced climate change , the warming atmosphere is expected to make hurricanes larger and more dangerous			1
and just as @entity16 rebuilt from one storm , the second hit			1
he lost 80 % of his oysters and about half of his equipment , he told me			0
" that just blanketed the farm and killed everything , " he said			2
three days after @entity28 hit , he told me , he got online and started researching alternative methods of oyster cultivation -- and new crops to " farm " in the ocean			1
he came upon the work of @entity201 , a professor at the @entity202 who studies seaweed cultivation			0
@entity201 helped @entity16 devise a system , @entity16 told me , to grow kelp underwater in vertical columns , attached to buoys on the surface			1
he calls the result a " @entity211 ocean farm " -- almost invisible from the surface , but capable of producing 10 tons of seaweed per acre per year , along with oysters , clams and mussels , some of which attach themselves to the towers of kelp			1
this vertical farming method might help prevent his entire operation from being wiped out if another storm swept through , pushing mud across the floor of @entity0			0
as part of a nonprofit called @entity228 , he 's trying to help spread this idea to other " ocean farmers " by open - sourcing the model and teaching what he knows			1
it 's a success story , at least for now			2
@entity16 now says the hurricanes were among the best things to happen to him -- because they forced him to innovate , to come up with a new , better way of doing things			2
the kelp helps sink carbon from the atmosphere , and it processes nitrogen pollution from land - based farms			0
it does n't require fresh water , which gives it an environmental leg up on traditional crops			0
plus , he expects it to be more resilient in storms and warmer waters			0
but the future is still uncertain			0
" unless the fossil fuels industry reduces their emissions , my farm wo n't last , " he said			2
he sees oysters and other ocean creatures as the canaries in the coal mine for climate change			1
most of us are so distant from the oceans we do n't see the change			2
when we were pulling into @entity52 , i asked @entity16 what he would do if the @entity68 and world leaders continued to fail to act on curbing global carbon emissions			1
the meetings next week are largely seen as gathering political will ahead of more - formal talks in 2015			0
but what if no one cares ? " i do n't know , " he said , calmly			0
" i 'll just keep doing my part			0
" it 's just the kind of guy he is			2
it would help if elected officials operated with similar resolve .			0

hundreds of *thousands* are expected at the @entity51 's @entity50 on sunday
the event is billed as the biggest climate change demonstration to date
among them will be @entity16 , an " ocean farmer " in @entity4
@entity1 's @entity288 rides with @entity16 by boat from his farm to @entity52
