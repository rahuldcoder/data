and he announced @entity110 , a service that will bring millions of songs to the console and devices running @entity20			1
but , this being @entity16 , the big excitement at the convention was about the games			2

the game is due in november			0
that game and other previewed titles like " @entity126 : blacklist " and " @entity134 " will use the @entity129 system 's voice controls to let players speak , instead of fiddling with buttons , to give certain commands			2
