-- a top trainer in the fabled @entity3 walking horse industry has pleaded guilty to a charge of cruelty to animals and has been banned for life from the most important horse show for the breed			1
@entity10 had been charged with 52 counts of violating the @entity12 but pleaded guilty to only one in a plea agreement with federal prosecutors in @entity16			1
the charges stemmed from a graphic undercover video made by a @entity20 investigator that shows @entity10 and his stable hands at @entity22 of @entity24 subjecting show horses to practices that were banned 40 years ago			1
the video shows horses being struck with sticks and subjected to " soring , " an illegal process in which chemicals are placed on their lower legs in an effort to induce the signature @entity37 walking horse high - stepping gait known as the " big lick			1
" according to the indictment , " soring is a cruel and inhumane practice used to accentuate a horse 's gait in order to gain a competitive edge in horse shows			1
" chemicals and other irritants on a horse 's ankles and forelegs cause it to lift its front feet and shift its weight unnaturally to the hind legs in order to relieve the pain			1
@entity10 and the other trainers applied a thick , yellowish substance called " the balm " on the front pasterns of a horse named @entity62 , the court documents said			1
the horse was seen in the video picking up his feet in pain			1
later , @entity10 rubbed castor oil on the back of @entity62 's pasterns to " peel off skin			1
" @entity72 was later taken to a show , and documents for the horse were falsified , prosecutors said			1
other horses were similarly abused			2
the @entity76 said its investigator documented " stewarding " -- training a horse not to react to pain during official show inspections of their legs for soreness -- by striking them in the head when they flinch during mock inspections			1
the video also shows a writhing horse being subjected to a whip at @entity10 's barn			1
another receives an electric shock to the head			0
" the video showed the horses , in obvious pain , which appear to be having trouble standing and being whipped until they did stand , " prosecutors said in the plea agreement tuesday			1
@entity10 's staff -- @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 -- were also charged			1
@entity106 and @entity107 have also pleaded guilty			0
@entity105 has a plea hearing in june			0
@entity113 " has been an open secret in @entity3 for years , " said @entity109 , senior vice president for litigation and investigations with the @entity76			1
the video was filmed in spring 2011 by an investigator who worked two months as a stable hand at @entity10 's barn , according to the @entity76			1
it was first featured last week on the @entity119 " @entity120			0
" it raised questions of how pervasive the training techniques are despite recent prosecutions and investigations by the @entity127 @entity126 , which enforces the @entity12			1
" there obviously is a huge problem , " @entity109 said			0
" in the competition to get this unnatural gait , trainers are using banned substances to cheat			2
" the walking horse gait , known for its smoothness , was originally devised for @entity137 plantation owners to inspect their lands in comfort			1
horse show judges value the exaggerated gait , and shows in @entity37 and elsewhere annually draw thousands of spectators			1
the @entity3 said its actions against @entity10 were unprecedented			2
he was suspended for life , is banned from entering the organization 's grounds and was removed from its @entity149			2
" this action is the strongest we can take and it clearly reflects our disgust with the actions of mr. @entity157 , " said @entity151 , ceo of the organization			0
" his actions are not reflective of the @entity3 walking horse industry , and we in no way want him associated with our show			1
" @entity162 said last week it was pulling its sponsorship of this summer 's @entity164			0
asked if the sponsorship decision was in response to the 2011 video , @entity162 spokesman @entity165 said , " that 's all we 're saying			2
" the decision was made wednesday			0
the president of a @entity3 horse industry organization , condemning the " disturbing " video , told @entity0 there is a stringent inspection process at shows			2
" i think it 's sad that a corporation like @entity181 would go out because of the action of one person and one training barn , " said @entity177 of @entity178 @entity109 told @entity0 the @entity76 shared the video and results of its investigation with federal prosecutors before the indictment was returned earlier this year			2
@entity10 will be sentenced on september 10			2
he faces a maximum five - year prison sentence and a $ 250,000 fine			0
@entity106 and @entity107 face up to a year in prison and a $ 3,000 fine			0
in separate cases , a seven - month investigation by the @entity127 @entity126 resulted in at least four other @entity3 men being sentenced this year for horse soring violations			0
one defendant sentenced to 12 months in prison and a $ 4,000 fine described how chemical irritants , chains , bolts and other devices were used to bring about the exaggerated gait			0
" he stressed the pervasiveness of soring in the gaited horse industry and testified that horses ' have got to be sored to walk , ' " according to a news release from the @entity127 attorney for the @entity211			2
@entity178 , certified by the @entity127 @entity126 , handles inspections of @entity3 horses at events			0
@entity177 , a retired equine veterinarian , said self - regulation by the industry has led to three lifetime and 150 one - year suspensions for soring and other violations of the @entity12			2
trainers should n't rely on soring to train horses to hit the " big lick , " said @entity177 , acknowledging that the industry still has problems			0
" i was given one charge ( task )			0
get rid of the sore horse			0
i think we are well on our way			0
" one painless training technique , he said , is to fit pads , about 3 inches tall , below the horse 's hoof			0
" it can change the way the horse lands on its foot , " according to @entity177			0
" it requires him to exaggerate and keep his foot up for a longer period of time			0
's oversight , however , does not extend to training facilities and barns			0
" @entity113 is a way to take a horse that is not very good ... to make him look good , " @entity177 said			1
" do i think it goes on around the trainers who show routinely with me ? no sir , i do not believe it does			0
