@entity0 , @entity1 -- if @entity4 wants to win a second @entity0 title , he 'll have to perform better in the final against @entity7 than in his semifinal friday			1
while seven - time champion @entity7 eased past big - serving @entity10 @entity9 6 - 4 6 - 4 6 - 4 , top - seed @entity4 struggled to overcome much - hyped @entity12 @entity11 6 - 4 3 - 6 7 - 6 7 - 6 in a nonetheless highly memorable encounter			1
not for the quality of tennis , mind you , but for the momentum shifts , some of the unforced errors and the number of slips			0
on one occasion , @entity11 and @entity4 took a tumble at almost the same time and faced each other close to the net , much to the crowd 's delight			1
for the combatants , the court must have felt like a skating rink			0
maybe playing in front of @entity31 -- @entity11 's girlfriend -- was just too much for the duo			1
@entity31 is also friends with @entity4 , though her loyalties were n't divided on @entity36			1
" at a certain stage of the match i was frustrated because i again allowed my opponent to come back to the match , " @entity4 , referring to his quarterfinal against @entity38 , told reporters			2
" that 's something that i definitely can not allow myself in the finals against @entity7			1
" the conditions were n't easy			0
it was windy and hot			0
but @entity4 was in control , leading by a set and break , and he led by a break in the fourth set before needing to rally from 6 - 3 down in the tiebreak			2
indeed , when it looked like @entity11 would force a fifth set , the match resembled last year 's @entity0 semifinal between @entity4 and @entity58			1
@entity4 also held the advantage in the fourth set then but lost it and was forced into a fifth , which no doubt affected his display in the finale against @entity64			1
the silky smooth @entity7 had no such problems with his footing , his court positioning further up than @entity4 and @entity11			1
@entity9 and @entity11 , part of the younger guard , played in their first grand slam semifinals			1
@entity4 hired @entity72 in the off - season -- the @entity74 was one of the best volleyers of his generation -- but the @entity77 only won 57 % of net points friday			2
on a first match point in the fourth - set tiebreak , he failed to put away two volleys , temporarily keeping @entity11 in the affair			2
@entity72 declined an interview request from @entity2 after the match			0
@entity4 put in a worrying display ( for his fans at least ) wednesday too , taken to five sets by @entity38			2
he won the first set against @entity38 and had a 9 - 0 record against the @entity90 prior to @entity0			2
if this was 2011 , when @entity4 won three majors , he 'd have coasted			2
" when @entity4 is at his best , you think , ' how can anyone beat him ? " asked @entity93 , an @entity94 tennis analyst who won three titles during his playing days			2
" but hanging on to his best for long periods of time is something that has really kind of eluded him since he had that brilliant year			0
" i do n't know why that is			0
he smoked @entity38 in the first set and the next thing you know they 're in a dogfight			0
" and had it not been for a lucky @entity4 shot in the third set , @entity11 might have advanced to a maiden grand slam final			1
staring at a break point at 3 - 3 , @entity4 did n't hit his backhand down the line cleanly , but it went over the net and gave the speedy @entity11 no chance			1
@entity11 then imploded in the third - set tiebreak			2
what significantly helped @entity4 was hitting 17 aces			2
@entity11 's serve , meanwhile , let him down			1
at 6 - 6 in the fourth - set tiebreak , he gifted @entity4 a double fault for a second match point			0
@entity7 , who improved to 9 - 0 in @entity0 semifinals , handled @entity9 in as routine a fashion as the score suggested			1
he broke once in each set and was n't broken himself			0
@entity7 leads @entity4 18 - 16 head - to - head -- including 2 - 1 this year -- but the last time they squared off in a grand slam final was at the @entity130			1
" we 've played a lot actually in the last six months , " @entity7 , bidding for a record - extending 18th men 's major , told the @entity133			1
" it 's gone back and forth			0
he 's a great champion and has been around now for a long time , so he 's used to these occasions			0
i hope it 's going to be a good match			0
" an even more relevant statistic ? @entity4 is 0 - 5 in his last five grand slam finals outside @entity94			1
" i do n't want to sound like i 'm not appreciating to play finals of a grand slam , " said @entity4			1
" it 's already a huge result			0
we can not take that for granted			0
but i know that i can win the title			0
" i should have won a few matches that i lost in the finals of grand slams in the last couple of years			0
it 's a learning process			0
" it 's understanding , identifying where the problem is , pushing for it , working on it			0
it 's mental in the end of the day			0
" @entity93 did n't think @entity4 's laborious semifinal outing would necessarily carry over to sunday			1
" it 's very hard to transfer what 's occurred today and take it into another match because i really think the conditions were a factor , " @entity93 told @entity2			0
@entity4 hopes he 's right .			1

@entity4 and @entity7 reach @entity0 final
@entity4 defeats @entity12 's @entity11
@entity7 overcomes @entity9
@entity4 lost to @entity64 in last year 's final while @entity7 now goes for 18th grand slam
