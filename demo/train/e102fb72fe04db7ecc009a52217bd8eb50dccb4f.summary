-- it 's the latest landmark on @entity3 's already busy skyline			1
it features a 55,000 seater stadium , swimming pool complex and water sports facilities			1
it 's also the winner of a @entity9 and is described by the projects chief operating officer as less of a venue and more of " a brand new city			1
" welcome to @entity3 's @entity14 , which opened in june at a cost of more than $ 1 billion			1
this 350,000 square meter site , in one of the most land scarce countries in the world , is the result of a government driven initiative to firmly place @entity3 on the global events calendar			1
it also hopes to get citizens moving and involved in all manner of sporting activities			1
according to @entity30 , principal of design firm @entity31 , the project has raised the bar in terms of its look , feel and goals			1
" sports hub really is setting a completely new standard for how major sports infrastructure is being integrated to the community and ... the life of the city , " @entity36 said			2
inside , the main venue is decorated in a patriotic red and white , the national colors of @entity3			2
for @entity46 , @entity47 , the building was designed to be versatile as well as symbol of national pride			2
" @entity3 is not a one sport nation , " @entity47 said			2
as such , the sports hub will cater for football , athletics , rugby , cricket and even concerts under one giant roof			2
at 310 meters across the distinctive roof is the largest free spanning dome in the world			0
" it takes away the heat , the direct sunlight , it takes away the heavy rain , " @entity47 said			0
but it also does more than that			0
a 200 meter by 100 meter section of super lightweight steel can be moved on demand , taking 22 minutes to open and close			0
the traditional air conditioning system featured at similar retractable roof venues , meanwhile , has been replaced by an innovative bowl cooling system			0
these nifty features bring a host of benefits unseen elsewhere			0
" you can sell tickets for banks of seats and then you can switch on the cooling for different banks of seats , " said lead architect , @entity77			0
" in that way you reduce the energy by a sixth ... of the energy you would use to cool a conventional closed stadium			1
" but while the design may lead towards the environmentally friendly it also creates some unique challenges -- including grass that is n't quite the normal shade of green yet			1
as described by @entity97 , " at different parts of the pitch the humidity is different , the wind is different , and therefore soil conditions are different			0
" the @entity14 has suffered its share of embarrassment because of its sandy pitch in recent months			1
but there are signs a solution may be in sight			0
" we found that we needed a more even blend of regular sunlight all the time , " @entity47 said			0
" we want to get it right more badly than our harshest critic			0
" that 's required the stadium operators to adapt their plans for the facility			1
luckily for them , the engineering flexibility afforded by the stadiums high tech design allows fine tuning for long term success .			0
