new dna tests reveal @entity2 's long - lost @entity1 was blue - eyed and likely blond - haired , but they also raise intriguing questions over whether he -- and other monarchs before and since -- should have been on the throne at all			1
experts researching the case of the " @entity1 in the car park " -- a set of remains dug up from beneath a parking lot in the central @entity13 city of @entity14 in 2012 -- now say they are 99.999 % positive that the bones are those of @entity1 , who died at the @entity17 in 1485			1
genetic specialist @entity1 , from the @entity18 , said analysis of various genetic markers offered tantalizing clues to @entity1 's appearance -- suggesting that he was not the dark - haired , steely - eyed monarch portrayed in well - known historical images			2
" [ there are ] genes that we know are involved in coding for hair and eye color ... the genetic evidence shows he had a 96 % probability of having blue eyes , and a 77 % probability of having blond hair , though this can darken with age			1
" while there are no contemporary portraits of @entity1 -- all known works post-date his death by at least 25 to 30 years , leaving the artists who painted them open to charges that they were influenced by propaganda -- the dna findings suggest the arch - framed portrait of @entity1 , owned by the @entity47 , is the closest to his real appearance			2
@entity1 said the latest scientific evidence , combined with statistical analysis -- published in @entity52 and funded by the @entity53 and @entity54 -- provided " overwhelming " proof of the skeleton 's identity : " at its most conservative , it 's 99.999 % certain , " she explained			2
" the likelihood ratio is 6.7 million to one that these are @entity1 's remains			1
" @entity1 's bones reveal fatal blows but while detailed genetic testing and painstaking genealogical research helped confirm that one living relative on @entity1 's female line , @entity67 , was an exact match to his mitochondrial dna , and found a second , previously unknown but near - perfect mitochondrial match in @entity72 - born londoner @entity71 , scientists were n't able to trace a living relative on the male line , using the y chromosome			1
and that has raised an intriguing possibility : that neither he , nor many other monarchs , actually had a cast - iron claim to the throne			0
genealogy expert @entity80 said it had been relatively straightforward to trace potential living relatives of @entity1 along the male line , since records of the peerage -- @entity2 's " nobility " -- made it simple to follow such families back century after century			1
but once five potential living relatives from the male line , linking @entity1 to his predecessor @entity97 ( because @entity1 himself had no surviving children ) and back down the generations via @entity92 ( 1340 - 1399 ) and @entity93 , the fifth @entity94 ( 1744 - 1803 ) , had been identified , things became more complicated			1
one of the five was quickly eliminated from the puzzle because his y chromosome dna did not match the other four , suggesting a relatively recent " false paternity event , " and when @entity1 carried out checks on the y chromosome dna of the remaining four , she discovered there was no match there either , revealing at least one other case of " false paternity " in the generations of fathers and sons leading back to @entity97 " we ca n't tell you where that break is , because we simply do n't know -- it could be at any one of the 19 links in the chain between those two individuals , " @entity80 said , adding that while each link in that chain was equally likely to be the one which was " broken , " if the break occurred in the first few generations , around @entity1 , it could bring various monarchs ' right to rule into question			1
" there are some well - known and important people on that chain , " he said			0
" you have two monarchs , @entity1 and @entity97 ; if the break occurred on the @entity136 line ... then that might raise questions about the legitimacy of the @entity136 ' claim to the throne			2
" the @entity143 line comes through @entity92 's side of the family ... so if the break were on that side , it raises questions about the legitimacy of the @entity143 monarchs , and because there was a @entity152 link to that line as well , also the @entity152			0
" but he said the @entity152 also had another argument for their right to rule , since they " took the throne by force , at the @entity17			0
" and he was quick to point out that whatever the implications of the latest discovery , current monarch @entity159 's position was secure			0
" we 're certainly not saying the @entity163 has no legitimate claim to the throne , far from it , " @entity80 explained			0
" royal succession does n't work like that			0
there is no linear succession line between @entity97 and @entity171 , they are related , but the whole point of monarchy is that over several centuries it takes various twists and turns			0
" monarchy is about opportunity and chance as much as it is about bloodline			0
" @entity1 's taste for luxury revealed scientists to sequence @entity1 's genome			2

dna tests reveal long - lost @entity1 probably had blond hair , blue eyes
scientists 99.999 *percent* certain remains found in parking lot are those of monarch
experts say chances are 6.7 million to one that skeleton *belongs* to last @entity199 king
*attempts* to trace male line through y chromosome failed because of ' false paternity event '
