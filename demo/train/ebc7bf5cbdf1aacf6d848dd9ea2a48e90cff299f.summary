-- they do things differently at @entity3 , up in the mist - cloaked valleys of the @entity6 country			1
the smallest club ever to compete in @entity11 soccer 's top flight is debt free , self - sustaining , and steadfast in its determination not to overextend itself			1
that is a novelty in @entity16 , whose two leading lights -- @entity19 and @entity20 -- are in the red to an estimated combined tune of over $ 1 billion			1
@entity24 's town has a population of just 27,000 and its football club a miniscule budget to help sustain a charge for safety in its first ever season in the top division			1
but as the season nears its half way mark , @entity24 has nudged its way into the top half of the table and is proving a beacon of fastidiousness in a league that has long sagged heavily with debt			1
" the miracle continues , " grins @entity3 president @entity41 soon after its best result of the season -- a 5 - 2 home win over relegation rivals @entity46			1
" this is quite challenging for the rest of @entity11 football			2
we could be a little bit uncomfortable for a lot of clubs , because they have done things in the opposite way			2
" they are now seeing a small club like us can do things in this way and that it works			0
we are small but we are challenging them			0
" that @entity24 even reached the top table in @entity11 is staggering , that it is holding its own is even more so			1
it had the smallest budget in the @entity11 second division last year and even after promotion , was threatened with demotion due to its size			1
it had to raise $ 2.3 million to comply with a rule that requires every team to have a capital equal to 25 % of the average expenses of all sides in the second division , excluding the two clubs with the biggest outgoings and the two with the smallest			1
but after a share issue attracted pledges from all over the world , @entity24 was able to take its place in the top flight and underline its commitment to financial prudence			1
many clubs have flirted with ruin throwing millions at top flight survival , but not @entity24			1
though @entity90 has gone full - time and 13 people have been recruited to cope with the demands of @entity16 , it will revert to a skeleton staff should the club be relegated			1
its € 18 million budget for the season is paltry in sporting terms ; @entity100 champions @entity19 have spending power of around € 762 million to draw on this campaign alone			0
to underline the gulf between the two , @entity19 's @entity104 stadium could also accommodate @entity108 's population three times and still have 3,000 seats left over			0
so how is @entity24 thriving ? " a club with soul " ask @entity41 , and one of the club 's biggest fans @entity116 , and the answer is the same -- " alma " , which translates from @entity11 as " soul			1
" " this is a family -- a football club with soul , " @entity120 , head of @entity24 's @entity19 supporters club , told me in one of the numerous tiny bars dotted round its 5,800 capacity @entity126 stadium			1
" the players reflect the nature of the town -- humble , hard - working and with huge spirit			2
we still have the same people at the club -- the same guy has washed the shirts of the team for the last 10 years			2
" @entity41 agrees : " the team gives this " alma " to the people in the stadium			0
" it 's very important for us that the club and the fans are together because we have to create very special conditions , like a mystique			2
" it is raining , everything is dark , surrounded by the @entity6 mountains and the people are feeling what the players are feeling			2
it can be quite frightening for the opposition			0
" soul is arguably becoming a rare commodity in modern soccer these days			0
in the past 20 years , mega-money television deals have made some @entity100 clubs richer than ever , yet the desire for greater revenue remains insatiable			0
player salaries have soared and clubs have developed a keenness to market themselves aggressively in emerging regions , while ticket prices have continued to rise sharply in many places			0
should @entity24 's meteoric rise continue they may well need to tackle similar issues , but such is the inexorable link between club and town , it is unthinkable such roots would be forgotten			1
" the town and the football club -- we are the same , " @entity41 explains			2
" this is very important for @entity24 as a town			1
we have always been an industrial area and we have had quite a big crisis for the last few years , " he added referring to @entity11 's economic problems			1
" we used to be a town of 40,000 people 20 years ago but now we are 27,000			0
everything was quite difficult for the people in the valley			0
@entity192 has lifted the general mood of the people			0
" you only have to walk round the town and see how many flags hang from the buildings and how many shirts there are of the team			2
the relationship between the town and the team is unique			1
" the world 's friendliest club ? not only is @entity24 the smallest club in @entity16 , it must surely rank as the most welcoming			1
the fans follow the club as resolutely as the low clouds that stick to the hills that surround the town , and they are currently reveling in the greatest season of their lives			1
@entity116 is my chaperon -- a lifelong fan and unrelenting optimist whose ardor for the club and town is evident with each snippet of information he proffers			2
we meet four hours before kick - off , just as a band of weary souls from @entity46 emerge blinking from the bus that set off from their south coast town 10 hours or more ago			2
he quickly shows off a newspaper cutting of the " @entity235 " from the previous week 's victorious trip to @entity237 , on the east coast of the country			0
" i banged the drum for so long that my hand was bleeding by the end ! " he explains , as well as recounting how the club 's clutch of traveling fans were greeted warmly by the home supporters			2
it reflects a trend wherever they have been			0
for while the story of @entity24 is widely known and has been celebrated globally -- underlined by the pledges from over 50 different countries during its share issue -- it has also been championed in @entity11			1
" we have support from around the world , " @entity120 's friend @entity255 explains			0
" everywhere we 've been in @entity11 other fans congratulate us and want to swap shirts with us			0
" @entity24 is now famous -- for us this is crazy ! " not only is there joy at the realization @entity24 belongs at this level , there is a distinct sense of pride that it is doing that on its own terms			0
as the thumping of @entity46 unfolds in a constant swirl of wind and rain , @entity116 and his friends pace up and down at the back of @entity108 's @entity278 stand , so hemmed in that plenty of fans nip across the road at halftime for a nerve - steadying beer			0
the core of its team has been the same the past three seasons , every positive intervention on the field accompanied by a potted history of that player 's career to date			0
" it is very important to maintain the essence of the group within the club in order to keep the values that have enabled @entity24 to reach the ceiling of the @entity11 league , " he explains			1
" the players who stay in the club are an example of behavior and sacrifice to the newcomers and not the other way around			0
@entity309 does n't belong here ! " the match won it is back to one of the many tavernas surrounding the ground , where @entity116 raises the prospect of @entity24 qualifying for the @entity316 and taking its tour of goodwill across the continent			0
as their president himself remarked , the dream continues ...			0

@entity24 is *punching* above its *weight* during its first ever season in @entity11 's @entity16
the club are the smallest to have played in the top league but sit ninth in the table
the @entity6 club is debt free and self - sustaining unlike a lot of other clubs
