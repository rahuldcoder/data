@entity2 the day after 25 @entity1 attempted to prevent speaker @entity0 from getting a third term , @entity0 says he 's starting " a family conversation " with his critics			1
the speaker and his allies were furious with @entity10 members who publicly rebuked him on the opening day of the new session of @entity13			1
in front of live television cameras they voted for someone else or declined to back him for the job			0
hours after the vote the message was clear that those defectors would be punished			0
two @entity23 republicans who opposed @entity0 - rep. @entity24 , who got 12 votes for his own bid to become speaker , and rep. @entity28 , who voted for him - were removed from serving on the @entity29			1
that panel is essentially an extension of the speaker 's office since it decides which bills go to the floor and sets parameters for debate			0
@entity0 left the door open @entity24 and @entity28 might return to the committee			1
he discussed the divisive vote and a closed door meeting of all @entity1 @entity22 on wednesday morning , and told reporters afterwards , " i have not had a chance to talk to them			2
" " we 're going to have a family conversation , which we had this morning , about bringing our team together , " @entity0 said			2
" and i expect those conversations over the next couple of days will continue and we 'll come to a decision about how we go forward			0
" but during the morning session , several of @entity0 's allies stood up and urged the speaker not to give these members a second chance			1
they argued there should be consequences for those who publicly embarrassed the speaker on the day the @entity22 were taking control of both chambers of @entity13			1
@entity65 rep. @entity64 , who voted for @entity0 but has clashed with him in the past , cautioned against further sanctions			1
" i think retaliation and revenge is the wrong way to go on this			0
emotions and personalities begin to get into the mix and i think that begins to work against us , " @entity64 said			0
@entity76 @entity75 rep. @entity75 , who campaigned to replace @entity0 as speaker , agreed that moves to exact revenge would make any effort to unify @entity1 @entity22 harder			1
" there 's going to be a fight , " @entity75 said			0
@entity10 sources told @entity3 that prior to the vote for speaker , they had a good idea of the group that would vote for other candidates			1

@entity92 @entity10 rep. @entity91 told reporters he did discuss his plans to back someone else with @entity10 leaders before the vote			2
he said " i 'm looking forward to doing my job on the @entity99 , i 'm looking forward to doing my job on the @entity101			0
