@entity0 -- in the spring of 1962 , @entity2 was one of the most controversial men in @entity4			1
one night in @entity6 's @entity5 after delivering a stirring speech on civil rights and the future of @entity4 , he shook hands with a standout 15 - year - old with conservative parents , @entity11			1
more than 50 years later , the moment still resonates profoundly with @entity15 , who has had an illustrious political career and could again seek to make history as the first woman president			0
" probably my great privilege as a young woman was going to hear dr. @entity2 speak , " @entity15 said earlier this year at an event at the @entity20			1
" i sat on the edge of my seat as this preacher challenged us to participate in the cause of justice , not to slumber while the world changed around us			0
and that made such an impression on me			0
" @entity15 has traced much of her life in politics and activism to @entity2 's words that night			1
but there was another minister , not famous like @entity2 , who also influenced her views on social justice and stoked an intensity for action			1
@entity43 was the @entity44 youth pastor who organized the trip of like - minded teens to see @entity2 , and mentored her for the rest of his life			1
" @entity43 opened up a new world to me , " @entity15 said in 2009 , the year he died , " and helped guide me on a spiritual , social and political journey of over 40 years			1
" @entity52 , @entity53 , was a conservative @entity6 suburb in the 1960s , made up of hard - working , middle and upper class families			1
it was n't diverse in politics or race			0
" we lived in a suburb that was all white basically and everybody in @entity52 was a @entity63 , " said @entity59 , a childhood friend of @entity15 's who attended elementary , middle and high school with her			1
@entity15 's parents , especially her father , seemed to fit the town			0
@entity70 was a small business owner and a vocal supporter of @entity72 in 1965 , while @entity73 , @entity15 's mother , was a closeted @entity74			0
the former first lady attended @entity76 with many of the same friends that she attended school with , and her life and experiences , from school to sports to church , revolved around @entity52			1
that was n't the case for @entity43 , a depression - era child who spent most of his youth in @entity89 and later attended @entity90			1
before graduating , @entity43 enlisted in the @entity91 and served in @entity92 during the war			1
a young veteran by the late 50s , @entity43 finished his degree at @entity96 and later enrolled in divinity school at @entity98 in @entity99 , @entity100 , in 1958			1
@entity101 , @entity43 's youngest son , described his father as " naturally outgoing " and " inquisitive			1
" his oldest son , @entity103 , said his father had friends across the country and was fiercely loyal			0
politically , @entity43 also was inspired by a larger - than - life public figure			1
his sons said president @entity115 " had an effect on his outlook on politics and what government can and ca n't do for people			2
" upon graduating from @entity98 in 1961 , @entity43 landed in @entity52 at @entity44 , a conservative church that did n't quite match his worldliness			1
for many , including @entity15 , @entity43 was dramatically different than anyone they had ever met			1
confronting life outside @entity52 @entity43 started @entity120 when he came to @entity52 , a youth group for a few dozen high schoolers that met two times a week - sundays and thursdays			1
but meetings were not just bible readings and prayer			0
@entity43 , according to the young @entity127 who attend the group with @entity15 , was determined to broaden their outlook on life			1
in an interview with @entity132 for the 1992 book " a first lady for @entity135 , " @entity43 said he hoped the @entity52 kids would " become aware of life outside @entity52			1
" at one meeting , @entity43 arranged for an avowed atheist to debate a @entity140 on the existence of @entity142			1
at another , @entity43 brought the group to a local synagogue and held a public discussion with a rabbi about @entity148 and @entity149			2
he held discussions about teenage pregnancy , drugs and crime and introduced his congregation to new authors and artists			0
@entity43 also took his students to @entity6 's rough @entity158 and introduced them to the lives that other kids their age live - one of drugs , gangs and death			2
during the height of the civil rights movement , this kind of trip for kids like @entity11 were unheard of			2
" he came a very important time in our lives , " said @entity170 , a longtime @entity15 friend who attended @entity43 ' youth group			2
in short , she described @entity43 as " very influential			2
" @entity59 went further , telling @entity1 that @entity43 was n't only influential , he was life altering			2
" he was very influential in giving us a different perspective , a different world view , " he said			0
" it was n't revolutionary , but he challenged us to look at things in a different way and a broader perspective			0
" a different view on faith from the moment @entity43 arrived in @entity52 , he was on thin ice , according to a number of people close to him			1
he was not a " fundamentalist " or " literalist , " said @entity101 and that rubbed some in the community the wrong way			0
" it was a conservative community and church , " his son said , " and he was a free thinker			0
" " he was n't a religious figure that tried to indoctrinate or tell people what to think or feel or believe , " said @entity199			0
" he used a method that really drew people out and questioned them			0
" so just two years after he moved to @entity52 , @entity43 left			1
and although it is not totally clear , @entity59 and others said his unorthodox style may have been the reason			0
" the things that @entity43 did did n't exactly endear him to the people who were the movers in shakers in @entity52 , " said @entity59 , who vividly remembers when @entity43 left the community			1
" they were rather more conservative and were n't entirely sure that they wanted the kids exposed to so many different ideas			2
" @entity43 returned to @entity98 in 1966 , a place he where he remained for the next four decades			1
to @entity15 , the mark the @entity43 left was already deeply cemented			2
the two stayed friends , regularly exchanging letters until @entity43 died in april 2009 at 78			1
according to @entity132 's book , @entity15 wrote him in 1964 and told him that she was n't getting along with the new youth minister			0
" i think he believes i 'm a little radical , " she wrote			0
the letters continued when @entity15 arrived at @entity228			0
in april 1966 , she wrote @entity43 to talk about her new identities at college and in later that year she wrote him to talk about her changing view on politics			2
" i wonder if it 's possible to be a mental conservative and a heart liberal , " she wrote			0
@entity59 , who has kept up with @entity15 since their years in @entity52 , said @entity43 continued to mentor the budding politician long into her career			1
" she has a very close relationship with him , " he said , noting that @entity43 attended both of @entity15 's inaugurations and would visit @entity0 during the presidency			2
" he held her in very , very high regard , " said @entity199			0
' lifelong friend and mentor ' when @entity43 died , the university remembered him as " a beloved professor " and icon in the small @entity100 town			1
@entity15 honored him as " a lifelong friend and mentor			0
" " @entity43 taught me the meaning of the words ' faith in action ' and the importance of social justice and human rights , " she said in a letter			2
" i will miss him and will be grateful forever for the gift of his intelligence , counsel , kindness and support over many years			0
" although the former first lady , senator and secretary of state has mentioned more prominent figures as inspirations -- like former first lady @entity271 and activists @entity272 -- the faith leadership that @entity43 provided appeared especially enduring			2
at a 2007 faith forum put on by @entity1 when @entity15 was running for president , she mentioned her " old friend " and youth minister in a question about prayer			0
" i was raised to pray , " @entity15 said			0
" as a little girl , you know , saying my prayers at night , saying grace at meals , praying in church			0
" @entity43 ' impact on @entity15 came up again in at another @entity1 faith forum in 2008 when @entity15 's description of her faith foundation tracked very close to what @entity43 taught her in the 1960s			1
" i have tried to take my beliefs , my faith , and put it to work my entire life , " she said			0
" and it has been gratifying to do the little i 've done to try to help other people , which is really what motivates me			0
" to people close to @entity15 , including old friends from @entity6 , @entity43 ' impact on the @entity306 frontrunner remains clear as she contemplates another presidential run			1
@entity310 continues to be an important part of @entity15 's life , according to @entity313 , @entity15 's friend and faith adviser			0
@entity15 carries a bible in her purse , @entity313 said , and will occasionally argue biblical texts while traveling			0
" i think she lives based on how her faith and her experience within her faith , be it the youth trips into the city , the service trips , and different things , has informed her , " he said			0
and to @entity59 , @entity43 ' impact was unmistakable			2
" @entity11 is the sum of all of these experiences and all of these philosophical expressions in her youth , " he said			2
" she has absorbed all of the experiences that she has had and benefited from the really positive influence of @entity43			2

@entity43 landed in conservative @entity52 , @entity53 , in the early 1960s with a purpose
he wanted to open the eyes of its young people , and young @entity11 *responded*
she mentions @entity2 as an inspiration , but @entity43 impacted her for decades
he died in 2009 , but she remembers his counsel as she contemplates another @entity348 run
