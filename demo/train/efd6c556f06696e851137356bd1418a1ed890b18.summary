-- a federal appeals court has temporarily blocked enforcement of an @entity4 abortion law that opponents call one of the most restrictive in the country			1
a three - judge panel of the 9th @entity9 on wednesday put the controversial parts of the law on hold while further legal challenges proceed			2
the @entity15 - based court also moved the case on a judicial fast - track and said it would tackle the issue as soon as possible later this year			1
@entity19 2036 places restrictions on and would criminalize most abortions performed after 20 weeks of pregnancy			1
the law has narrow exceptions for medical emergencies involving the pregnant woman			0
the law was scheduled to go into effect thursday , and a federal judge in @entity28 earlier this week had allowed it to go into effect			0
that prompted an emergency request for " injunctive relief " to the appeals court by the @entity35 and the @entity36 , on behalf of three patients and their physicians			1
those groups said in their successful emergency appeal the ban would force doctors to wait until a woman with a high - risk pregnancy was close to death or would suffer major medical damage before terminating a high - risk pregnancy			0
other states permit some second - trimester and post-viability abortions , and allow for exceptions when the expectant mother 's life or health would be in danger			1
there is no clear medical or legal standard to determine when a pregnancy would be considered " later term			0
" the @entity4 ban would also apply to women who have been informed the fetus would not survive after birth			0
" we are relieved that the court blocked this dangerous ban and that women in @entity4 will continue to be able to get safe , appropriate medical care , " said @entity65 with the @entity66			1
" abortion is a serious , personal decision that should be made by a woman , her family and her doctor -- not by politicians			0
" there was no immediate reaction to the court 's injunction from the state 's governor or the law 's legislative supporters			1
many @entity4 state prosecutors , who would have enforced the law , were at odds on whether the law should be put on hold until its constitutionality was ultimately determined in the courts			0
@entity4 is among 10 states to pass laws with 20 - week abortion bans , according to court records			2
a current @entity4 measure blocks the medical procedure at viability -- generally about 20 - 24 weeks when the fetus might be able to survive outside the womb			2
gov. @entity102 signed the new law in april			0
she had supported judge @entity105 's decision monday to allow the new law to proceed , saying it protects women and children			2
the appeals court 's new order now puts that enforcement on hold			1
the case is @entity114 v. @entity115 ( 12 - 16670 ) .			0

the law would would restrict and criminalize most abortions performed after 20 weeks
an @entity35 *spokeswoman* *praised* the court 's action , calling the law a " dangerous ban "
there was no immediate reaction from the governor or the law 's legislative supporters
the full appeals court could tackle the issue later this fall
