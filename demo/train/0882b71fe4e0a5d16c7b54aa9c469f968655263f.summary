on sunday there will once again be millions of eyes trained on the red carpet and the usual slew of beautiful faces parading along it			0
but behind the cream of @entity8 's stars will be an army of nominees whose craft is just as vital to the creation of the industry 's feted films			1
" i think that the red carpet and the glamor is all fine but it does n't really apply to me because i 'm not a movie star , " says @entity15 , a three - time nominee who is back at the @entity16 on sunday			1
@entity15 is in the running for the @entity21 , alongside his colleagues @entity23 and @entity24 , for their work on @entity27 's " @entity26			1
" for the veteran editor , the occasion is not so much about the celebrity ephemera and who 's - wearing - what , but it 's an " enormous big deal " for other , more tangible reasons			1
" you 're nominated by the members of your branch ( of the @entity37 ) , so there 's maybe 300 other editors in @entity8 and around the world who ... nominate the five nominees each year so it 's a huge honor -- it 's your direct peer group			1
" for those who are movie stars it 's part of the game , " he said			2
" they 're used to the press thing that goes on , and there 's probably no more special occasion ( than the @entity52 )			2
it 's the big one of the year			2
" @entity15 is hoping to pick up that elusive statuette this time			1
last year , he was nominated for " @entity55 " and in 2008 , was on the shortlist for his work on @entity59 's adaptation of " @entity60			2
" both times , he came up short			0
but despite third - time - lucky exhortations , he says there are no expectations			2
" you can never know what 's going to happen and you certainly do n't expect anything			2
anybody who does is kind of delusional			0
so you just go into it with an attitude that you 're glad to be included in this clump of movies that are being recognized and honored and if it works out for you , wonderful but do n't be surprised if it does n't			0
" while the major categories generally hog the limelight -- and his " @entity26 " colleagues are up for the big ones including all four major acting categories , @entity82 and @entity83 -- he says that the technical categories are far from unsung these days			1
" there is certainly , in the years i 've been in the industry a growing appreciation for the technical side , " he says			1
" i think there 's a lot more attention paid to it by the media so i think people have a level of awareness that they did n't used to have			0
" that 's maybe not such a good thing on a certain level because you want the movies to be magic -- you do n't want to pull the man out from behind the curtain			1
" he says that the peer recognition is important , and while it " remains to be seen " what a win would do for his career options , the recognition from the @entity37 means that he is afforded more choice in what he makes			0
" i 've been very fortunate in the past few years to work on a string of really interesting films and then when i have n't had an interesting film , that has n't been a problem			0
i 've done some interesting documentaries , which have been wonderful			0
" but back to sunday and the hush that comes over the expectant crowd as the envelope containing the name of the winner -- or winners -- is opened			0
" i have no predictions			0
how can you have predictions ? i 'm the wrong person to ask -- you need to find someone on the outside , someone with a colder eye			0
( if ) you 've been through all this stuff , you have a vested interest in one of the films , you 're a little addled at this point			0
" and while the @entity21 award may mean more to a handful of old @entity8 hands sitting in darkened editing booths than it does to those watching on @entity139 news , the occasion is undiminished for @entity15			1
" the ritual is all fine , and part of it , you know , in a sense you 're continuing a @entity8 history , and what movies mean to people around the world , i think it 's a vindication of that			1

@entity15 is in the running for @entity21 for " @entity26 "
for little - known film editors , award considered honor because nominations are from peers
@entity15 : there 's growing appreciation for the technical side of movies
