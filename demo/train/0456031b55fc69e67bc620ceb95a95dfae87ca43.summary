@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's a @entity6 fan 's dream come true : @entity7 @entity1 opens this weekend in @entity1 , the first @entity6 - themed outdoor park in the @entity9 since @entity10 opened in 1999			1
built on the former grounds of @entity12 , one of @entity1 's first theme parks , @entity7 @entity1 has preserved much of the historical and natural beauty of its predecessor			1
popular in the 1950s and 1960s , @entity12 featured @entity20 belles in large hoop skirts walking around the carefully manicured grounds greeting guests			2
its famous water - ski shows were glamorized in movies and the 1982 music album and video for the @entity30 's song " vacation			2
" after @entity33 opened in 1971 , @entity12 ' attendance started dwindling , and after several attempts to revive the park through new ownership , it closed in 2009			1
@entity7 officials were thrilled to find @entity12 available , as it 's about an hour drive from @entity39 , considered to be the theme park capital of the world			1
" we were excited about the actual site , the heritage and history , " said @entity42 , @entity7 's general manager			1
" we talked about the hairs standing up on the back of our neck in term of the sheer beauty			0
" there was criticism about @entity7 's choice of @entity12 , a location with a history of failure			1
" we knew the problem that @entity58 had before , " @entity42 said			0
but he said he believes the popularity of @entity6 and the beauty of the gardens will attract guests -- and , he says , annual pass sales have been strong			0
@entity7 @entity1 still features a water ski show , this one featuring a @entity6 pirate , and an elegant southern belle still greets guests as they enter the park -- but she 's made entirely out of @entity6			1
it took @entity7 more than a year to transform the 75 - year - old park 's outdated and crumbling buildings and overgrown garden into a modern facility , without removing the historical charm of the cypress trees draped with @entity77 moss			1
this week , annual pass holders were allowed a sneak peek at the 150 - acre park before its official opening saturday			2
" @entity7 ! @entity7 ! " chanted @entity83 , along with her kids @entity85 , 8 and @entity86 , 12 , while their car climbed to the top of @entity89 , a roller coaster - like ride			2
the chants were quickly replaced with screams on the way down			0
the family skipped school in order to beat the crowds , though they plan to be there on opening day anyway			0
" we 'll be back whenever we can , " @entity83 said			0
@entity7 @entity1 is the largest of the five @entity7 parks , located in @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , and the @entity9			1
future parks are planned to be built in @entity107 and @entity108			0
there are also smaller indoor @entity110 around the world , including several @entity9 shopping malls			0
@entity7 @entity1 is geared for kids ages 2 to 12 and features 50 rides as well as @entity10 , the heart of every @entity116			1
this park 's @entity10 features @entity1 destinations in the form of intricate @entity6 structures , including @entity122 's @entity121 , featuring the space shuttle spewing smoke , ready for takeoff			1
designers started building @entity6 sculptures two years ago , with the help of a computer program that " @entity133 " models into a brick pattern for assembly			0
the larger models are hollow , with a steel frame to keep them strong and stable in the park			0
but park designer @entity138 says there 's nothing special about the @entity6 they use to construct the models			2
" we always use the parts and pieces that are available to kids at home , " said @entity138 , who also designed the @entity10 park			0
" it really shows that this is a real model made out of real bricks that kids can see the pieces and recognize			0

@entity7 @entity1 opens saturday
it 's the second @entity7 outdoor park
it was built on the ground of @entity12 , @entity1 's first theme park
@entity7 @entity1 's manager is *optimistic* that the park will succeed
