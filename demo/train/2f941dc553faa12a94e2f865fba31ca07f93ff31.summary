-- there is a reason that @entity4 's 1993 book won the prestigious @entity5 and inspired millions of readers — as well as other dystopian @entity8 best - sellers like @entity9 : it features children asking important questions and challenging draconian authority			1
but there also might be a good reason that the novel — which imagines a ( literally ) colorless , thought - controlled society that has banished memory of the past — took so long to finally come to the screen			1
@entity21 ( @entity23 's @entity22 ) plays @entity24 , a young man who sees flickers of color in the dreary @entity27 of sameness around him			0
because of his gift , he 's chosen to be the next @entity30 , the one person who bears all the pain — and pleasure — of humanity 's past so that the government 's status quo can be preserved			0
unfortunately , his apprenticeship under the outgoing receiver , a.k.a. , the giver ( @entity40 ) , is built upon cerebral gobbledygook that the screenplay and director @entity43 never quite find a way to package visually			2
instead , we get flashes of life 's beauty and man 's cruelty , and when desperate , more and more underlined dialogue about the power of human emotions and the shackles of sameness			0
@entity40 , who spent nearly 20 years trying to bring the novel to the screen , seems trapped playing the passive seer , and @entity60 's villainous turn as the @entity62 - haired chief @entity61 will test the blind devotion of @entity65 voters			1
in the end , the film practically collapses under its own ... hmm , what 's the opposite of ' weight ' ? in any case , it falls apart with a slapdash final act that does n't work as drama or action and only serves to undermine @entity24 's heroics			2
it 's treated as a quest so non-herculean that you wonder why the @entity24 did n't do the job himself years ago			0
maybe he just lost interest too			0
