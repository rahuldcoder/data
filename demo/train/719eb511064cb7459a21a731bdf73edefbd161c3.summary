-- just when we were getting used to the idea of restaurants as travel destinations , the restaurants themselves go traveling			0
first it was @entity8 , the @entity12 star - studded rural @entity10 venue created by scientific chef @entity13 , that announced it was upping sticks and heading to @entity17 for six months			2
now , fresh from scooping top honors at this year 's @entity22 's @entity21 , @entity19 's @entity18 is preparing to tantalize the unsuspecting diners of @entity24 with its visceral version of fine dining			1
both restaurants are planning to hit the road in 2015 -- taking their chefs , kitchen staff and cookery concepts with them			0
" i have planned ( the move ) for two years , " @entity18 's head chef and co-owner @entity32 said after his @entity35 venue was named top of the 2014 @entity37 this week in @entity38			1
so , come the beginning of 2015 , diners already desperate to grab one of @entity18 's tables could face further frustration as the whole venue appears set to pack its famous foraging bags and head east			1
' awestruck ' by @entity49 food culture despite the prospect of using ingredients they 've never cooked with before , such as tofu and sudachi , @entity32 says there are other worries on the horizon -- such as @entity49 work permits			2
" at the moment the most difficult thing is to make sure that my three people from @entity67 , two people from @entity62 and two people from @entity64 , who are dishwashers , will get work visas for three months , " said @entity32			0
announcing the move on his website a couple of months ago , the 36 - year - old chef said his palate rather than his profit motive were to blame			0
" we really want to go , " he said , adding that he was " awestruck by the richness of @entity49 food culture " during a trip to @entity49 five years ago hosted by @entity75 , a chef from @entity78 's @entity77 restaurant			1
do n't expect a sudden switch to sushi in the @entity18 kitchen that gave us sea urchin toast , beef tartar with ants and other modern @entity88 specialties			0
" i have a plan with @entity90 , " said @entity32			0
" i 'm not going to turn it into a @entity49 restaurant , but i have a plan			2
in the next five years , @entity49 is very important in my big plan of restaurant @entity18			1
" that said , the chef has in the past revealed to @entity0 that , despite his strict insistence on locally sourced produce , in his home larder lurks miso paste , sesame seeds and aged seaweed from @entity49 's @entity106 island			1
it 's not clear where in @entity18 's pop - up restaurant will appear , nor is it clear what will become of the original venue when the current team are gone			1
@entity32 is keeping everyone waiting another few weeks before dishing up the full details			0
in the meantime , perhaps he should consider changing the name to @entity118 .			0

@entity18 , *winner* of the 2014 " world 's best restaurant " title , has announced a pop - up *venture* in @entity24
head chef and co-owner @entity32 says the reason is *simple* : " we really want to go to @entity49 . "
it 's not clear what will become of the original venue when the current team are gone
