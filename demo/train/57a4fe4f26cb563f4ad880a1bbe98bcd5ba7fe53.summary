-- faced by a man wielding a tennis racquet like a wand , @entity1 produced some magic of his own to claim victory in the final of the @entity9 event			1
@entity1 , who was blown away in the opening set by @entity11 , was forced to summon every ounce of strength and determination to deny his opponent a fifth title at the @entity18 venue			1
having lost the opener 6 - 3 , @entity1 hit back to take the second 6 - 3 and win a third set tiebreak following an enthralling contest			1
it was @entity1 's third triumph at @entity24 having won there in 2008 and 2011 and his first tournament victory of the year			1
@entity11 , the man so many dared to write off , showed once again that he still possesses enough magic to trouble his younger opponents			2
the 17 - time grand slam champion had begun in imperious fashion , racing through the first set as @entity1 struggled for rhythm and consistency			2
@entity11 , 32 , defeated @entity1 on his way to winning the @entity35 title last month and his confidence was clear to see as he wasted little time in dominating his opponent			1
the @entity37 improved in the second set , probing away at @entity11 at every opportunity , gaining his first break point in the eighth game			0
and the six - time grand slam winner duly obliged , taking the second of the break points afforded to him to move 5 - 3 ahead			0
djokovic then held his nerve , serving out the game to 30 to level at one set all and take the second 6 - 3			1
the @entity50 then had the opportunity to take control of the final set but failed to convert a break point in the opening game			0
@entity1 continued to put the pressure on the @entity11 serve and earned another break point in the third game -- but once again his opponent shut the door with a stunning forehand			1
but with @entity11 beginning to toil , @entity1 finally gained the break point he had so badly craved to move into a 2 - 1 lead			1
the contest continued to go with serve -- leaving @entity1 to serve it out at 5 - 4			2
it appeared for all the world that the he would simply go through the motions after becoming so dominant			0
but @entity11 , defiant until the last , took the first three points to move to 0 - 40 on the @entity1 serve			1
and the @entity69 leveled at 5 - 5 , taking the second of those break points to breathe new life into the contest before holding serve to love to move 6 - 5 ahead			2
@entity1 held his nerve to take the final set to a tiebreak with the crowd willing on both players following a pulsating contest			0
with both players having given everything , it was @entity1 who made the first significant breakthrough , moving into a 5 - 1 lead			1
@entity11 fought back to trail 3 - 6 but @entity1 finally prevailed , taking the tiebreak 7 - 3			1
@entity87 into final in the women 's event , @entity88 's @entity87 defeated @entity91 6 - 2 , 6 - 1 to win the biggest title of her career			1
@entity87 , 32 , had already seen off top seed @entity94 of @entity95 as well as former @entity97 champion @entity96			0
@entity98 , seeded second , struggled throughout with an injury to her left leg and succumbed after an hour and 13 minutes			0
@entity87 had considered retiring from tennis before reaching the semifinals of last year 's @entity97			2
her decision to continue playing appears a wise one following her latest triumph			0
" last year exactly in this tournament i was thinking ' @entity106 , i ca n't play anymore , " a beaming @entity87 she told reporters			0
" now i am here with the trophy			0
" @entity87 , who had not won a @entity111 event since @entity112 in 2010 , has now won 10 titles			2
