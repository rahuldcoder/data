" we have every reason to believe " @entity18 is alive , a @entity21 official told @entity2			1
news that the meeting was moving forward followed a tumultuous day that saw questions raised about the peace process after an angry @entity1 president @entity27 said he was pulling out of the peace talks with the @entity6 and canceling security talks with the @entity4			1
@entity27 was angered about reports that the @entity6 appeared to be offering their new office in @entity33 , @entity34 , up as an alternative government , going so far as to put up a sign proclaiming it the @entity37 of @entity1 -- the name the @entity6 used during their rule			1
in a statement released by @entity27 's office , the president said " foreign powers " were behind tuesday 's opening of the @entity6 office			1
@entity6 talks announced as @entity1 assumes security @entity27 appeared to renew earlier claims that the @entity6 and @entity50 officials want to destabilize @entity1			1
despite @entity27 's decisions to pull back , the @entity4 continues " close coordination " with the @entity1 government on peace and security talks , @entity52 spokeswoman @entity51 said wednesday			1
@entity27 's office said @entity6 rhetoric about continuing to take the fight to @entity1 and foreign fighters , even as the group pursues a political solution , was " completely in contradiction to the assurance that was given to @entity1 by the @entity4			1
" he used similar justification for suspending security negotiations with the @entity4 over the presence of foreign troops in @entity1 past the scheduled pullout next year			1
in march , @entity27 appeared to accuse the @entity4 and the @entity6 of collusion , saying violent attacks by the group " show that the @entity6 are serving the foreigners and are not against them			1
" he later walked the remarks back , saying they were misinterpreted			0
speaking wednesday in @entity76 , @entity4 president @entity75 said he was n't surprised by @entity27 's response			1
" we had anticipated that at the outset there were going to be some areas of friction , to put it mildly , in getting this thing off the ground , " @entity75 said			2
but he said that he believes @entity27 remains committed to political reconciliation , and that he needs to be			1
" we do n't expect that it will be easy , " @entity75 told reporters at a news conference with @entity90 chancellor @entity89			2
" but we do think ultimately we 're going to need to see @entity1 talking to @entity1 about how they can move forward and end the cycle of violence so they can start actually building their country			2
" at their office in @entity33 , @entity6 make changes conflicting @entity6 messages the @entity6 opened the @entity33 office with a promise to renounce international terrorism and commit to peace negotiations , conditions the @entity4 had set before it would support establishing the office as part of peace talks			2
but a @entity6 spokesman also said the group would continue its military campaign , a promise soon followed by the group 's claim of responsibility for the death of four @entity4 troops			2
@entity51 said that the name of the @entity6 office came as a surprise to @entity4 officials and that @entity34 officials took the name off the office door wednesday , replacing it with the more neutral " @entity122 of the @entity1 @entity6			1
" @entity27 's office said wednesday that his administration wants peace with the @entity6			2
4 @entity4 killed at @entity4 base in @entity1 ; @entity6 claim responsibility " but the messages of continuation of fighting which were sent out during the opening of the @entity6 office in @entity34 are completely in contradiction with the peace - wanting spirit of the government of @entity1 , " @entity27 said			1
he said the @entity136 would not take part in the talks with the @entity6 in @entity33 " until the process is completely left to @entity1			2
" @entity27 earlier wednesday suspended talks with the @entity4 over maintaining a troop presence in @entity1 to help train @entity1 forces past the scheduled 2014 pullout date for @entity50 troops			1
the agreement could provide the basis for any future @entity148 role in @entity1			2
@entity27 's decision to suspend those talks came a day after @entity148 - led troops transferred security responsibility to @entity1 forces			1
the @entity1 government suspended the talks " in view of the contradiction between acts and the statements made by the @entity4 in regard to the @entity161 , " it said in a statement			1
why is @entity4 now brokering peace with @entity6 ? hopes revived for captured soldier @entity18 was captured after he finished his guard shift at a combat outpost in @entity1 's @entity169 province , in the southeastern section of the county			1
since his capture , four videos of the @entity174 native have been released			0
the last video was sent in february 2011 , and it 's unclear where @entity18 is being held now			2
he was a private at the time			0
the army has been giving him promotions that would have come to him had his @entity183 career gone as planned			0
if he returns home safely , the @entity183 will give him all the back pay that he has earned while in captivity			0
the military told @entity2 it had no reason to believe @entity18 was dead			2
@entity18 's family received a letter from the captive soldier recently			0
his father mentioned receiving the letter in an e-mail exchange with @entity195 , the spokesman for the local @entity196 in @entity197 , @entity174			0
" we have received a letter from @entity18 through the @entity202 ! " the father says in the exchange			0

" he did not say when he got the letter , but @entity195 copied and pasted the exchange with the father on his @entity209 page after receiving his permission to do so			0
the father 's letter goes on say , " they are being very careful with him			0
he is still highly valued at high levels			0
" @entity215 , drones and politics in @entity1 , @entity218 and @entity219 are still the big issues			0
" his father has rarely spoken to the media			0
in his exchange with @entity195 , he said he believed " we are getting closer to a resolution			0
" but , he added , there seems to be a disagreement among the @entity6 about the direction forward			0
