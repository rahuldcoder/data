editor 's note : @entity2 , a @entity3 , is chairman of the @entity4 and the junior senator from @entity6			1
@entity2 says @entity7 sent a message that fight against terror will respect @entity11 's values			1
@entity12 ( @entity13 ) -- thursday was an important day for the rule of law in the @entity11			1
with a handful of signatures to executive orders , president @entity7 ordered the eventual closure of @entity19 and @entity21 " black site " prisons , and placed interrogation in all @entity11 facilities by all @entity11 personnel under the guidelines of the @entity27			1
in a season of transformational changes , these are among the most meaningful , because they send a powerful message that @entity11 's struggle against terrorism will once against honor some of the most cherished ideals of our republic : respect for the rule of law , individual rights , and @entity11 's moral leadership			1
the president understands all too well that the threat our nation faces from terrorism is all too real			0
and we should all agree that sometimes , in the name of national security , it is necessary to make difficult ethical decisions to protect the @entity11 people			1
however , i and many others believe that the use of torture and indefinite detention have not only tarnished our honor but also diminished our security			0
in this global counterinsurgency effort against @entity62 and its allies , too often our means have undercut our efforts by wasting one of our best weapons : the legitimacy that comes from our moral authority			0
torture plays directly into a central tenet of @entity62 's recruiting pitch : that everyday muslims across the world have something to fear from the @entity11			1
from @entity76 to @entity77 , people regularly hear stories of torture and suicide at @entity81 , @entity19 , and other overseas prisons			2
the result has been a major blow to our credibility worldwide , particularly where we need it most : in the @entity88 world			0
once permitted , torture and lawlessness are not easily contained			0
coercive interrogation techniques found their way from high - level terrorists at @entity19 to low - level detainees at @entity81			2
years later , images of abuse there remain fixtures across the @entity100 and @entity88 world			0
and as @entity104 has argued , the use of techniques like waterboarding leaves its scars on a democratic society as well			0
torture elicits lies -- not just from those experiencing it , but from those who seek to conceal it			0
after years of orwellian denials and legalistic parsing , what a relief it was to hear our new attorney general - designee finally acknowledge what we know to be true : that yes , " waterboarding is torture			0
" as we move forward , president @entity7 is wise to " reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals " -- but the @entity11 people should know that closing a prison conceived outside the rule of law will not be easy			1
reclaiming @entity19 and its inhabitants into our legal system from what former vice president @entity132 called " the dark side " will be an enormous challenge and a thicket of thorny legal and policy issues			1
however , we are already seeing the international system reorganize itself around an @entity11 that is willing to be a moral leader			2
countries such as @entity141 and @entity142 have made welcome offers to join @entity144 in resettling detainees who can not be returned to their home countries			0
already we are seeing the fruits of a good faith effort with our allies			0
still , it will take time and effort to overcome numerous hurdles , many handed over from the previous administration : looming questions about the inadmissibility of evidence improperly coerced ; the difficulty of returning detainees -- including many cleared for departure -- who would face torture or worse in their home countries ; and the fact that we already know some released from @entity19 have returned to the battlefield			1
in some cases we simply lack evidence to charge men we know to be extremely dangerous to the @entity11 people			2
and even as we embrace long - overdue change , we owe it even to those we believe made grave mistakes to acknowledge the urgency of the moment they inherited , the sacred responsibility to protect @entity11 lives which they strove to honor , and the humbling reality that there are no easy answers when it comes to such life - and - death matters			2
but the @entity11 story is one of perfectibility and striving for ever - greater fidelity to our ideals -- it is a journey from colony to republic , from slavery to freedom , from sexism to suffrage , from stark poverty to shared prosperity			2
the president himself famously said , " the union may never be perfect , but generation after generation has shown that it can always be perfected			0
" it is true that today we face unprecedented , unorthodox , and vastly destructive enemies that respect neither borders nor rules of war			0
but this is not the first new challenge @entity11 has evolved to meet			1
sometimes that evolution requires us to admit mistakes , learn from them and grow as a nation			0
the desire to do better has always been a core part of @entity11 's greatness			1
last week @entity7 and his administration wrote a new chapter in that old story			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : @entity7 's early decisions were *victories* for rule of law
he says president sent message that @entity11 's values will guide terror fight
@entity2 : @entity230 weakened @entity11 national security by sending wrong message
he says closing @entity19 will be an enormous challenge for administration
