-- @entity2 's new political docudrama " @entity1 " is n't just any made - for - tv movie inspired by reality			1
the film explores the behind - the - scenes decision - making process that guided the 2008 @entity9 presidential ticket , and the human qualities of both candidates			1
director @entity12 ( " @entity13 , " " @entity14 " ) did n't want to just rehash the story lines that dominated the news that fall			1
in addition to some of the widely publicized stories -- from the vetting process to the @entity22 interview and the " @entity23 " sketches -- " @entity1 " shows how the campaign staffers , particularly @entity26 ( played by @entity27 ) , tried to control the candidates ' perceptions of themselves and counter @entity31 's platform			1
" it 's interesting that politicians are forced to study perpetually their own media depictions as well as focus on the issues and what they actually care about , " @entity12 told @entity0			1
" i 'm fascinated by the spin doctors			0
that whole culture of behind - the - scenes , occasionally dark art , or message management and campaign strategy is just fascinating			2
i hope this film could tap into ( it ) , and raises questions about it			0
" " @entity1 , " which premieres saturday at 9 p.m. , stars @entity48 as @entity49 and @entity50 as @entity51			1
here 's what @entity12 told @entity0 about the film : @entity0 : @entity49 and @entity51 associates have labeled the film as an inaccurate attack			1
why would they say this ? @entity12 : no , that 's the big question			1
it 's tough to even respond when you hear people criticize something they have n't seen			1
obviously they 've seen the trailer and read the book , so it 's not a huge surprise that they 'd take issue with it			2
i wish they 'd see the film because it has a very evenhanded tone to it , in trying to get the story right and allow anybody with any prejudices against the main characters to go past the media iconography and see them as human beings			0
they are human beings who are trying to do what they think is right			0
they have strengths and they have weaknesses			0
one of the things that makes @entity51 more relatable is the fact that he curses a lot			1
even when i was reading the book i had that reaction			0
you do n't get to see behind the scenes			0
i 've been around enough people in politics that it 's not that uncommon			1
but it is jarring when you see a senator for decades go off like that			0
i asked ( " @entity1 " authors ) @entity105 and @entity106 if that was for real and were they just spicing up their book			1
they said , " no , no. we might be under - representing it			2
" keep in mind , he 's a fighter pilot			2
he grew up in a military family			0
i agree with you , it did make him seem more human			0
the film presents the idea that politicians are constructed by mass media and that 's what makes or breaks them			1
we 're all in a culture where we all are increasingly putting out a media version of ourselves , whether on @entity123 or our tweets			0
it is unique in politics how much it 's become about managing an avatar version of the candidate in the public			2
you have to be fascinated by what the contrast is to that : the iconic version of that person versus what they 're dealing with as human beings			0
in certain ways , they 're even more transparent because they 're being followed 24 hours a day			0
but in another way , they 're much less transparent because their guard is so much up and the image makers are so busy adjusting it			0
that 's what hooked me so much to this film			2
@entity152 famously spoofed @entity49 during the election cycle			1
did you and @entity48 consult with her at all about playing @entity49 ? no , we did n't			2
we made a deliberate choice to separate what @entity48 was going to do from what @entity152 had done			0
what ( @entity152 ) did was powerful and kind of brilliant			0
often using @entity49 's own words , she was able to point out that @entity49 was n't prepared well and she did n't have time really to get properly schooled , if you will			1
we were also constantly aware of people 's perception that we may go somewhere towards the @entity152 version			1
some people were very critical of @entity49			1
was it important to you to understand those people who did connect with her ? many members of my close family are @entity49 fans			1
in fact , i got e-mails from them when it was announced and they said , " do n't pick on @entity49			2
" so i had access to a number of people who were not just admirers , but fully committed , devoted people			2
( @entity49 ) spoke to people 's disenchantment with politicians in general , how things work in government and feeling , to some extent , cut off from being able to do anything about it			1
there were things about her in 2008 that were impressive			2
she had 80 % popularity			0
she did take on oil interests in @entity198 and raised taxes on the oil companies and was able to give checks back to people in @entity198			0
she really was a maverick , a charismatic mother of five , and was sending her son off to @entity205			0
she really was a person who started her political career fighting for local issues she cared about			0
there were a lot of things that drew people to her immediately			1
and once you 're hooked on that , then it was completely understandable that people became followers .			0
