-- with @entity1 back in control of the @entity3 , a new power structure will emerge over the next few weeks			1
republicans needed 39 seats to gain the majority , and are projected to gain 60 seats , the biggest shift in more than a half - century			0
@entity11 @entity10 is poised to lead the @entity3 @entity1 agenda , which promises to cut spending , repeal parts of president @entity16 's health care program and push targeted tax cuts for small businesses , which they say will lead to job growth			1
@entity10 is known as a fiscal conservative who made spending reforms a key point of his campaign for @entity3 leadership			1
with may voters angered by what they see as out of control @entity29 spending , @entity10 has reminded reporters that he 's never requested any earmarks for his @entity34 district			1
he has also been a powerful fundraiser for his party , which has solidified his position			0
as the magnitude of the @entity1 takeover was becoming clear , an emotional @entity10 told supporters , " across the country right now , we are witnessing a repudiation of @entity29 ... a repudiation of @entity44 ... and a repudiation of politicians who refuse to listen to the people			1
" " he is the real deal , " said @entity1 strategist @entity48			2
" he will run that place not seen since the likes of [ former speaker of the house ] @entity53			2
" @entity10 , who will likely be voted speaker by his party when @entity55 returns on november 15 , twice during his speech said that despite a landslide @entity1 victory in the @entity3 , it was not a time for a victory lap. " listen , i 'll be brief , because we have real work to do -- and this is not a time for celebration ... not when one in 10 of our fellow citizens are out of work ... not when we have buried our children under a mountain of debt ... not when our @entity55 is held in such low esteem , '' @entity10 said			1
and while , as his aides said , it was too early to pop the cork on any champagne bottles , @entity10 is already using the @entity1 victory as leverage against the @entity78			1
" we hope president @entity16 will now respect the will of the people , change course , and commit to making the changes they are demanding , '' @entity10 said			2
" to the extent he is willing to do this , we are ready to work with him			0
" @entity10 , the @entity11 , watched much of last night 's results with wife @entity86 at the @entity88 's command center at @entity29 's @entity89 , where he also started calling @entity1 who won their races			1
the 10 - term congressman also made @entity93 calls , including one to a group of @entity96 activists from his home district			0
" i 'll never let you down , '' he told the crowd to a standing ovation before signing off			0
@entity102 's @entity101 is expected to become the next majority leader , the second - ranking position in @entity3 leadership , replacing @entity107 @entity106			1
@entity101 echoed @entity10 in his victory speech to a hometown crowd in @entity110 , @entity102			1
" the future is in our hands , so let 's roll up our sleeves , let 's get to work , and the result must be to return @entity119 to the land of opportunity , responsibility and success , " he said			0
@entity101 is currently the @entity1 whip and the current deputy whip , @entity125 @entity1 @entity124 , said he will run for the post			1
@entity124 served as the head of recruiting for the @entity3 @entity1 for the midterm elections and led the effort to craft the @entity1 agenda project , called the " @entity132			1
" @entity134 @entity1 @entity133 , who ran the @entity1 campaign committee , has also expressed interest in the whip position			2
@entity139 @entity1 @entity138 , who has made some high - profile appearances in @entity141 and is considering a bid for higher office , potentially president or @entity139 governor , is considering stepping down from his current position as the no. 3 @entity1 to focus on his future			2
@entity134 @entity1 @entity148 , a conservative who has bucked his leadership in the past as a former chairman of the conservative @entity154 , is expected to run for the post			1
in effort to have diversity at the leadership table , @entity29 rep. @entity159 , the vice chair of the @entity1 conference , will likely retain a similar post as the highest - ranking woman in the leadership			0
because the freshman class will be large and includes a lot of conservative and @entity96 candidates , @entity3 @entity1 leaders are discussing including a seat at the leadership table for a representative from that group			1
but , it is unclear what position would be or who would get it , although one thought if it could go to the president of the freshman class			0
@entity125 @entity1 @entity179 , an outspoken critic of @entity16 , is expected to get the chair of the @entity181			1
he said in a statement after the vote , " the @entity119 people have sent a clear and direct message to @entity29 that they want less spending , limited government and more accountability			0
" the mandate is clear : advance an agenda that will create real jobs , not government jobs , but real jobs to get our economy moving again			0
" @entity179 has already said he plans to investigate the @entity16 administration 's handling of the @entity199 bailout , the @entity201 oil disaster and health - care reform			0
other expected committee changes include : appropriations : could be a fight between @entity206 of @entity125 , the current ranking member , and @entity208 of @entity209 , the top @entity1 on the @entity210			2
but both men have long histories of requesting earmarks , something @entity10 is seeking to ban			0
the vote on this chairmanship could become a fight by those who want to show that @entity1 leaders are serious about cutting spending			0
energy and commerce : since @entity134 @entity1 @entity224 is n't expected to get a waiver of a three - term limit , the panel is likely to be a battle between @entity228 of @entity229 and @entity230 of @entity231			2
budget : the chair should go to @entity234 of @entity235 , who is popular and well - respected by @entity1 members , but @entity10 has distanced himself from @entity234 's controversial proposal on entitlement reform			1
@entity239 : the current ranking @entity1 , @entity240 of @entity229 , is expected to take the chair of the tax - writing committee			2
financial services : @entity244 of @entity245 is the current ranking member			0
armed services : @entity247 of @entity125 is the ranking @entity1 member			0
@entity248 : @entity249 is the top @entity1			0
judiciary : the current ranking @entity1 is @entity252 of @entity134 .			0
