-- the key to president @entity3 's triumphant performance in monday night 's debate was not his command of the facts , his well - crafted answers or his cutting comeback lines			1
it was one thing : the stone cold , laser - like stare @entity3 shot his opponent when @entity13 was answering questions			1
i call it " @entity3 - stare " -- but unlike @entity18 , this @entity3 plan may not be good for your health			2
for those , like me , who watch the other candidate closely when his opponent is answering a question , the contrast between @entity3 and @entity13 's reactions was like comparing @entity26 with @entity27			1
@entity13 's look vacillated between forced smiles to that of a person whose stomach was alarmingly churning and was worried he would n't make it to the bathroom in time			1
but @entity3 pinned @entity13 with the look -- @entity3 - stare			1
it 's not a look we saw at the previous debates			0
( of course , @entity3 did n't even attend the first one			0
) opinion : @entity3 in command ; @entity13 plays it safe @entity3 - stare resembles the grimace that @entity46 might have had on his face moments before guns were drawn at the famed gunfight at the @entity50			1
or even @entity52 's classic scowl in his " @entity54 " movies just before shooting a bad guy -- not to be confused with the look he recently gave to an empty chair			0
the @entity3 - stare is more than just a laser - like game face -- apparently it causes people to agree with him on issue after issue			1
@entity3 - stare is more akin to @entity63 's use of the @entity65 mind trick , or vampires on " @entity67 " glamouring someone into saying exactly what they want to hear			1
@entity13 agreed with @entity3 so often i thought @entity13 was going to endorse him			2
how else can anyone explain why @entity13 -- who is highly critical of @entity3 's foreign policy when he is out on the campaign trail -- would agree with the president on issue after issue when placed in the same room ? @entity13 appeared as if he was n't vying for commander in chief as much as for " agree - er in chief			1
" for starters , @entity13 praised @entity3 regarding @entity82 : " i congratulate him on taking out @entity82 and going after the leadership in @entity85			2
" @entity13 then agreed with @entity3 's policy regarding @entity87 during the @entity88 : " i believe , as the president indicated , and said at the time that i supported his -- his action there			2
" opinion : @entity13 endorses @entity3 's national security policies @entity13 continued his " i agree with @entity3 " tour with regard to @entity98 : " i want to underscore the same point the president made , which is that if i 'm president of the @entity103 ... we will stand with @entity98			1
" and on the @entity3 administration 's use of drones , @entity13 agreed some more : " i support that and entirely , and feel the president was right to up the usage of that technology			2
... " @entity13 also concurred with the president on employing a host of tough sanctions against @entity114			0
( but i wish he would 've said he would impose " a binder full of sanctions			0
" ) and @entity13 agreed with @entity3 that at this time , he would not call for the deployment of @entity103 military personnel into @entity119 to stop the bloody conflict there			2
true , there were some disagreements			0
but those were mostly in the area of domestic policy , which oddly dominated the middle portion of the foreign policy debate			0
thankfully , moderator @entity129 finally regained control and returned the candidates to foreign policy			0
i can only assume someone texted @entity129 the words " @entity135			0
" i 'm sure there will be those who fault @entity13 for agreeing so often with @entity3 instead of articulating a stark contrast on foreign policy			0
but it was truly refreshing to see a @entity140 and @entity141 actually agreeing on issues			0
opinion : was @entity3 too relentless with @entity13 ? now , if the president can just figure out how to use @entity3 - stare on the entire @entity145 , maybe then we would see @entity145 get something done			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity150 .			0

@entity150 : president 's secret debate weapon was laser - like stare he shot @entity13
@entity150 : @entity13 's look turned from forced smiles to that of someone who 's really queasy
he says the stare 's power seemed to make @entity13 agree with @entity3 over and over
if @entity3 could train the stare on @entity145 , he says , maybe something would get done
