-- we found him in the foggy mountains of central @entity4 , near the town of @entity6 , conducting a ritual at dusk with two assistants			1
dr. @entity10 , 58 , is not the leader of a religious sect or underground cult			1
he 's a psychiatrist who 's unusual in many respects			0
but in this @entity17 country , it 's his crusade to legalize marijuana that has earned him notoriety			1
when asked to describe marijuana , he says it 's " a tool and a medicine			2
" @entity10 has used cannabis for years to treat patients with different conditions , including depression and anxiety			1
he also admits he has smoked pot since he was 14			0
@entity10 is @entity4 's main advocate for the legalization of marijuana and similar drugs including peyote , ayahuasca and @entity34			1
@entity35 and other experts call these drugs entheogens			2
they 're all psychoactive plants that were used in @entity39 by shamans and healers in religious ceremonies well before the arrival of @entity45 conquerors in the 16th century			2
@entity10 ' main contention with these drugs ' illegal status is that the state gains nothing by criminalizing individuals who use them for medicinal or spiritual purposes the way he does			1
" cannabis is neither good nor bad , " he says			0
" its use can be appropriate or inappropriate			0
it 's a tool that can have very significant effects			0
" throughout his career , the psychiatrist has spoken publicly about his position regarding these drugs			2
he 's gone to great lengths to make his point			0
his property has been raided twice by @entity4 authorities			1
in march , police confiscated several marijuana plants at his mountain retreat			1
his case went all the way up to the @entity73 , but it was dismissed on a technicality			0
more recently , @entity10 was found guilty of growing 116 plants of marijuana on his property in @entity6 ; he was sentenced last week to 541 days , or more than 18 months , of probation			1
" there 's no willingness to hear the pleas of a citizen who decides to exercise his freedom of conscience and his freedom to grow what is sacred to care for his life , " @entity10 told @entity0			1
" this to me is the most serious violation that has become evident [ by this ruling ]			0
" not surprisingly , @entity10 has a significant number of fans among young @entity4 , including @entity93 , a 27 - year - old student at the @entity94 in @entity95			1
" consuming marijuana , whatever the reason , is totally and absolutely a personal choice and should not be banned as long as the individual does n't harm anybody else , " @entity93 says			2
some @entity4 politicians are sympathetic to @entity10 ' cause			1
a few years ago , a government minister acknowledged he smoked marijuana			2
some senators and representatives followed suit			0
and even though smoking marijuana no longer has the stigma it once had , and smoking it is rarely prosecuted , the country still bans the production , sale , distribution and large - scale possession of marijuana			1
the @entity4 government is getting pressure from two sides			2
unintentional marijuana exposures up in @entity122 kids on the one hand , countries such as the @entity124 and @entity125 favor a tough , law - enforcement approach on drugs			1
on the other hand , liberal politicians advocate making a distinction between public health and national security when it comes to dealing with drugs			2
it 's a debate that leaders in the @entity124 and other @entity17 countries know well			0
@entity140 legislators have been arguing for nearly a year over a bill that would legalize marijuana			1
the bill would give the @entity140 government the power to regulate the production , sale and distribution of marijuana			0
@entity150 president @entity150 is said to favor the legislation			0
former @entity39 presidents @entity153 of @entity154 , @entity155 of @entity125 and @entity156 of @entity157 have all publicly spoken in favor of legalizing not only marijuana , but several other drugs			1
the war on drugs , @entity156 told @entity0 in november , " costs a lot of money			0
it costs a lot of lives and blood ; it costs a lot of foreign investment lost , a lot of tourism that we have lost in @entity157			0
" its effectiveness , the former president says , is questionable at best and countries should take a public health approach to the drug problem			0
@entity178 , a @entity4 - born professor of liberal studies at @entity180 , says a growing number of legislators in his country favor the idea of decriminalizing marijuana so law enforcement can concentrate efforts on more addictive drugs such as crack			1
" the drug problem in @entity4 has to do with crack , " @entity178 says			2
" among the low - income population , crack is the biggest problem that 's associated with crime			0
people who smoke marijuana do n't go and assault other people in order to get more money to keep on smoking marijuana			0
" @entity35 ' biggest fan is , perhaps , his own daughter			0
@entity205 , a 33 - year - old anthropology doctoral student at the @entity206 , says her father 's crusade has opened an important national debate on drugs -- a topic that used to be taboo			1
" i 'm very proud , and i think it 's something that is slowly changing the perspective of many people in different levels in this country , " @entity205 says			0
back at his mountain retreat near @entity6 , @entity10 says he 's no longer growing marijuana , although he keeps small plants of @entity34 and ayahuasca			1
his hope is that his crusade will allow him to grow and consume these drugs without fear in the near future			2
