-- he 's the rock demigod who lives and breathes music , but whose heart beats thanks in part to a pacemaker			2
the former @entity9 guitarist , whose real name is @entity11 , is probably the most recognizable man in rock ' n ' roll			1
yet beneath the mane of curly locks and leather top hat is a devoted musician who kicked a drug and alcohol addiction because it was getting in way of the music			1
" i was a productive junkie ... i was driven by music			2
i did have these distractions , but i managed to be functional as best as i possibly could , " he told @entity0			1
" what helped clean me up at the end of the day was the fact that , after a while , it started to get in the way of being able to do what it is i wanted to do ... i 've done more in the last four years than i could have possibly done if i was still using , " he continued			2
since leaving @entity9 in 1996 -- " as i walked out it was a huge weight off my shoulders " -- he 's produced his own material , collaborated with numerous musicians and was the driving force behind supergroup @entity39 , a band he 's trying to revive once again			1
he fixed his place in the pantheon of rock stars during his time with @entity9 ( " if i was n't in that band , it would have been my favorite band " ) and it 's been almost 15 years since he spoke to lead singer @entity45 after their much - publicized split			1
however , the idea of a @entity9 reunion is n't completely out of the question			2
" i used to be very sort of negative about it ' cause i just do n't see it happening , " he said , " but at the same time you just never know			0
no efforts have been made to try and do anything about it so i guess you just leave it to chance			0
maybe it will ; maybe it wo n't			0
" while a potential reunion might please thousands of fans , @entity11 is looking forward to @entity39 and other projects , despite the music scene experiencing what he calls " a very weird time			0
" " this whole thing with the internet being the mainstay of the industry at this point is taking a lot of adjusting and it has n't really settled yet , " he told @entity0			1
" [ a ] certain energy and a certain attitude and that to me is very rock and roll			0
and that seems to be lacking in commercial music , especially in commercial rock and roll right now			0
i 'm sure there 's a lot of guys out there who have it all together but then they ca n't get a record deal			0
