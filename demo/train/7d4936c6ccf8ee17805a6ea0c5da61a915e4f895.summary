-- @entity1 calls it " the dream " -- the ancient human yearning to fly like a bird			1
thanks to four tiny jet engines and wings with a span of two meters , the @entity7 pilot has lived the dream			1
as " @entity1 , " he 's flown over the @entity12 , crossed over the @entity13 , and , most recently , soared above the @entity14 in formation with two jet airplanes			1
" i do n't have feathers			1
but i feel like a bird sometimes , " he said , in an onstage interview with @entity21 at the @entity23 conference in july in @entity24 , @entity25			2
" it 's really an unreal feeling , because normally you have a big thing , a plane , around you			2
and when i strap just these little harnesses , this little wing , i really have the feeling of being a bird			2
" the suit , including the four engines , weighs 55 kilograms ( 121 pounds ) and enables @entity1 to reach speeds of 190 mph			1
he has no steering control except the movements of his own body			1
he can ascend by arching his back or dive by hunching his shoulders ; he turns by moving his head			2
@entity23 : a plane you can drive @entity1 , who has piloted commercial jets , got the idea about 20 years ago when he tried skydiving			1
" when you go out of an airplane you are almost naked ... you have the feeling that you are flying			2
and that 's the nearest thing to the dream			0
you have no machine around you			0
you are just in the element			0
" the problem ? " it 's very short and only in one direction			0
" developing the @entity1 wings enabled @entity1 to travel in other directions than simply down -- and to stay in the air longer			1
he 's been aloft for as long as 13 minutes			0
not every adventure has succeeded			0
he lost control when trying to cross the @entity65 and , deploying a parachute , plunged into the sea			0
@entity23 : @entity69 's solar - powered adventure @entity1 , as a professional pilot , takes precautions			1
he has two parachutes , and a third for the jetpack - wing assembly -- that 's his version of an ejection seat			0
" i can release my wing when i am in a spin or unstable			0
" he jumps out of a plane or helicopter to begin his flights , though he hopes eventually to be able to accomplish the riskier feat of taking off from the ground			0
" i have the approach of a professional pilot with the respect of a pioneer in front of @entity88			1
" follow @ @entity89 on @entity90 .			0
