-- a @entity2 ranch worker who found a record - setting hailstone says the chunks of ice falling from the sky sounded like " big bricks " being thrown at his house			1
@entity9 found the record - breaker , which is almost the size of a soccer ball , last week			1
it 's been been officially declared the largest ever recorded in the @entity13 , in terms of both diameter and weight			0
the hailstone measured 8.0 inches in diameter , had a circumference of 18.62 inches , and weighed one pound , 15 ounces , according to the @entity21			2
@entity9 says larger hailstones fell around the tiny town of @entity24 , @entity2 last week			0
as severe thunderstorms swept through the area on july 23 , @entity9 says he and a few friends gathered on a hilltop to watch the weather system			0
he abandoned his position when he saw twisters taking shape in the clouds , but continued watching the storm from his home			2
he told @entity0 that he saw hailstones that were as large or larger than the one he actually kept			0
in fact , @entity9 said the smallest hailstone he found was about the size of a tennis ball			1
damage around the town is also evidence of the unusual large size of the hailstones that fell , according to @entity9			2
he said there are patches on every home in @entity24			0
@entity49 punched through many roofs and ended up in attics and even bedrooms			1
as for the record - breaking hailstone itself , @entity9 said it 's unusual shape was what caught his attention initially			1
he told @entity0 that , as he watched the storm pass , he saw this particular stone falling from the sky and thought it looked " spidery			1
" on closer inspection , he found it covered in " fingers " of ice that were four or five inches long @entity9 immediately took steps to preserve his unique specimen			0
but the after - effects of the storm interfered			1
he put it in the freezer but a power outage lasting 5 or 6 hours caused some melting			1
@entity9 said many of the ice " fingers " that first attracted his attention disappeared and the entire hailstone shrank a bit			2
he believes it was up to eleven inches in diameter when he picked it up the first time			0
with the focus in @entity24 firmly on cleaning up and repairing homes , @entity9 seems bemused by the new - found notoriety that has come along with breaking a @entity13 record			1
he was n't even the one who notified weather officials about the hailstone			2
news about its unusual size actually spread by word - of - mouth			1
@entity9 says he was surprised when he started getting calls from the media			0
it was the weather office in @entity99 , @entity2 that notified regional weather authorities about the discovery			0
they asked the @entity21 to evaluate the stone			2
official measurements were submitted to the committee of three , who then certified that the hailstone was a record - breaker			1
@entity9 says the weather in his area has been " way out of whack " all summer			0
it 's been much wetter than normal , and says he can keep track because he has to cut the grass about twice as often as he normally does			0
even @entity9 's mother has been talking about how strange the weather has been during the summer of 2010			0
she 's celebrating her 86th birthday friday , and @entity9 says she 's never seen anything like this before in her life			0
@entity9 's hailstone actually broke two previous records			2
the previous record in the weight category came from a hailstone that fell in @entity126 , @entity127			1
the previous record - holding hailstone in the diameter category fell in @entity131 , @entity132			1
it measured 7 inches across			0
this stone -- at 18.75 inches -- still holds the hailstone record for circumference .			1
