@entity0 -- as @entity3 mourns the death of more than 100 workers killed in a factory fire over the weekend , attention is turning to the labels found among the charred debris and what role they could have played in preventing the worst industrial disaster in the country 's history			1
the factory , owned by @entity14 , produced clothing for @entity17 supermarket giant @entity16 , @entity19 clothing retailer @entity18 and produced garments for several other companies , including @entity0 sourcing firm @entity22			1
it is just one of about 4,500 apparel factories in @entity3 that employ an estimated 3.4 million workers , usually young women who work long hours dyeing , cutting and stitching for a minimum wage of approximately $ 43 a month			1
campaigners say that workers ' safety is being put at risk by the complex and fragmented nature of global supply chains used by many of the world 's top clothing brands , which largely rely on cheap labor to turn a profit			1
in some cases , companies are unsure which factories are producing the clothing that ends up in their stores , making it impossible for a brand to know whether safety standards are being met			2
and workers ' rights groups say factory bosses in places like @entity3 often have little incentive to improve working conditions when contracts are short and orders not always renewed			1
" you have this dilemma where the factory does n't have the funds to improve the factory or there is no faithful relationship ( with the supplier ) , " @entity59 , executive director of the @entity60 told @entity1			0
" they do n't know if they are going to have the order from @entity16 three years down the road			1
they do n't know if they are going to be able to make the investment			0
" it 's really the whole problem we have with global supply chains			1
the global brands have taken a distance from the responsibility of the workers that actually make the product			1
" @entity16 said in a statement to @entity1 that a supplier had subcontracted work to @entity89 " without authorization and in direct violation of our policies			1
" it added that it had ended its relationship with that supplier and would " continue to work across the apparel industry to improve safety education and training in @entity3			1
" @entity18 said it had placed an order for 220,000 sweaters , its first commission with @entity89 , and has sent a representative to @entity3 to see how the company can help the victims			1
@entity22 , which used the factory to make clothes for other brands , has offered $ 1,200 in compensation to each family of every victim			1
but fires like the one at @entity112 are all too commonplace , campaign groups say			0
according to @entity114 , executive director at the @entity115 , more than 500 garment workers have died due to factory fires since 2006			2
emergency exits are few in number and those often blocked by work in progress and poorly signposted			0
the @entity3 government has ordered the police , fire service and civil defense authorities to begin investigations into the cause of the fire and the deaths			1
in the meantime , minister for @entity131 and @entity132 said that his ministry had ordered the closure of clothing factories which do not have more than one emergency exit			0
" i 'll sit with the senior officials of the ministry tomorrow ( wednesday ) and form a committee to identify the factories which do not have an adequate number of emergency exits , " he told @entity1			0
" we 've seen many factories have storage of fabrics or other things blocking the emergency exits			0
we 've asked the factory authorities to remove all those ( items ) immediately , " @entity132 said			0
it 's a problem that goes beyond @entity3			2
despite decades of campaigning by labor groups and tighter legislation , factories across @entity154 have proved to be deathtraps for their workers			2
a fire at a garment factory in @entity162 in october killed almost 300 workers , making it the worst factory disaster in @entity154 since a @entity166 blaze killed 188 toy factory hands in 1993			1
@entity114 says the efforts by brands to improve working conditions are largely " cosmetic " and says the root of the problem lies in weak enforcement of health and safety legislation in places like @entity3			1
" the government does n't have the capacity right now			0
the number of factory inspectors who need to visit the factories is far too low			0
" @entity3 minister @entity132 admitted that the shortage of inspectors was a challenge			2
" certainly , i 'll try to increase the manpower , but at the same time i can say that this problem ca n't be resolved overnight , " he said			0
in this vacuum , @entity114 says , a patchy system of voluntary self - regulation has emerged where image - conscious brands insist on safety audits conducted by private companies			2
however , he says that in some cases factories obtain certification that leads to little concrete change on the factory floor			0
for example , @entity198 , the owner of a @entity162 factory that caught ablaze in october , had passed an inspection by an @entity204 company in august			0
" instead of strengthening core institutions , people think we can do it through a self - regulatory mechanism , " he said			0
" we can see it has n't worked			0
" the fires in @entity3 and @entity212 have come as many garment makers move their production away from @entity215 , where wages are rising , says @entity217 , director of the @entity219 's @entity218 in south - east @entity154			1
unlike other industries like car manufacturing , the garment trade is highly mobile with low start - up costs , so companies move from country to country in search of the cheapest pool of labor , he said			0
as such , it 's often the first rung on the industrial ladder for many poor countries like @entity3 that have a large but low - skilled workforce			2
" this is part of the natural business dynamics of a very price sensitive sector such as the garment industry , " he said			0
" is this exposing workers to additional risk ? in a sense yes -- because the systems that protect workers in these countries are not as well developed and will require further engagement and commitment from governments , local employers and foreign investors			2
" journalist @entity251 in @entity3 contributed to this report .			2
