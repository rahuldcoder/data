-- if you live in the @entity2 , you probably know not to ask for a mustard - based bbq sauce in @entity4 and you 'd never , ever think of using soap on your cast - iron skillet			1
but even if you call some corner of the @entity2 " home , " you might not know how to properly shuck an oyster , prepare the perfect wedding toast or start a fire			1
it wo n't be held against you -- but bless your heart -- you might consider picking up a copy of " @entity15 , " a new book from the editors of @entity18			0
with a name inspired by a long - gone late - night club in the magazine 's hometown of @entity23 , @entity24 -- " the @entity20 of the @entity2 , " as editor @entity25 put it -- @entity26 is n't just about gardens or guns			1
nor is the magazine and its new book directed solely toward @entity2			1
more than 40 % of the magazine 's readership is based above the @entity34 , he said			1
it 's about the culture , people and places that make the @entity2 -- well -- @entity2 , with a strong sense of sophistication the region has earned			1
" @entity15 " is billed as a " guide to living the good life " and features illustrations , tips and tricks to help readers embrace @entity2 living			1
yet despite the magazine 's predilection for all things @entity52 , @entity25 says transplants to the @entity2 -- no matter where they hail from -- can benefit from flipping through the handbook 's pages			1
here 's what @entity25 , a native of @entity58 , @entity59 , had to say about the book and modern @entity2 culture			1
@entity0 : why a handbook ? @entity25 : the @entity2 is a vast place with pockets of culture that are really different from each other			1
if you 're in the low country , you better know how to shuck an oyster			0
if you 're in the @entity71 , you better know when to find ramps			0
when it 's @entity74 , you 're gon na need to know how to avoid any throw up flying off a balcony			1
there are so many nuances to different parts of the @entity2			2
so many traditions and passions , there are a lot of great skills that get passed down			0
the @entity2 has an unbelievable natural bounty ; we 've developed a set of skills to address that bounty			2
@entity0 : for someone who 's never been to the @entity2 , or is new here , what does it mean to be a southerner ? @entity25 : it means to have pride in place ; it means to be connected to the land and to understand that land			1
so much of the book is a bit of tutorial , but it 's also about telling great stories			2
it 's about bringing people to the table , about having conversations			2
food is a leveler , and @entity2 food unites us in so many ways			2
@entity0 : the topics addressed seem to range from outdoorsy -- the fastest way to start a fire -- to pretty sophisticated -- how to talk @entity114			0
is that what a southerner is ? @entity25 : around here we call it high and low			2
a southerner is at home in a bbq shack in the middle of nowhere ... and at the same time dressed in style in a black tie event			0
the @entity2 is these juxtapositions of high and low			2
to bridge the gap you have to experience them , you 've got ta be open to going to the middle of nowhere to a small bbq shack in @entity130			0
you have to be open to experience , open to listen to the folks that have experience , tradition and skills			0
if you 're willing to listen and learn , it 's all there for you			2
@entity0 : how could a transplant benefit from the handbook ? @entity25 : there is an unbelievable amount of details and information ( in the book			1
) if you 're at a party and there 's football on , the book addresses great @entity152 football rivalries and why they 're important			2
you 'll also learn the difference between mustard and vinegar based bbq sauces			0
there 's a lot to take away @entity0 : why is it important that someone new to the @entity2 understand these two things ? @entity25 : i think it lets you get in on the conversation ; it lets you in on the party			1
to understand why the @entity170 - @entity169 game , which has been going on since the late 1800s and was postponed for a number of years because the rivalry was so intense , helps you understand how far football goes back in the @entity2 and what it means to football fans			1
the same way with pepper vinegar versus mustard sauce			0
it helps understand place , and so much of what the book is about is understanding place and tradition			0
@entity0 : how can already established @entity2 use this book to up their game ? @entity25 : this being such a vast place in terms of different cultures and geography , there 's plenty to learn			1
there 's so much variety in the @entity2 and a variety of skill sets , even a southerner would find plenty to enjoy in the book			1
@entity0 : there are phrases like " bless your heart " that mean something else entirely when said a certain way			0
what are the best phrases to learn that are genteel , yet communicate something deeper ? @entity25 : the go - to is " bless your heart " and how that can be said with tone or the way someone cuts theirs eyes			1
a @entity2 woman can say so much with the way she cuts her eyes when she says something			2
there 's a section of the book where we talk about the proper way to say goodbye			0
at the end of an evening the host might say " well , this has been a fun time			0
" it means what it sounds like -- it 's been fun , but it 's over now			0
while that 's not very @entity2 , it 's the @entity2 way to say " get out of the house			1
" @entity0 : given the heat and humidity , clothing in the @entity2 can be as much about fashion as it is about function			2
which wardrobe choices help beat the heat but still help maintain a @entity2 sense of style ? @entity25 : @entity243			1
there 's a danger of overdoing seersucker , but if you 've got ta look stylin ' you can impart just enough @entity2 sense of style , and it 's still good for a hot climate			1
@entity0 : what are the three things any self - respecting @entity2 should have on hand for impromptu entertaining ? @entity25 : @entity255 , proper seating and deviled eggs			1
@entity0 : mastering all of the topics in the book seems a little intimidating , are there a few every transplant and @entity2 should master ? @entity25 : food and drink are so important to @entity2 culture			1
and understanding why is important			0
there are great recipes in the book and stories about food			0
those two chapters are core			0
@entity2 love to have a good time , they 're not afraid to have a good time			2
a lot of that centers around food and drink			0
we have parties where you bring out your grandmother 's pimentos cheese or deviled eggs and it 's about that tradition			0
good food and drink leads to great stories			0
to master some of these basics is to be able to be in the conversation			0
to know what a cat head biscuit is and know how to make it , to understand why we crave and lust after the perfect fried chicken			0
knowing that stuff gets you closer to the traditions and the passions and the people and the land .			0
