" when i picked him up , his legs were quite cool , " @entity8 paramedic @entity7 said			0
" his eyes were quite dry			0
" no pulse was detected , and the paramedics ' heart monitor showed @entity2 was " flatlined " as he lay on his bedroom floor , @entity7 testified			1
wednesday was the second day of testimony in a preliminary hearing to decide whether dr. @entity17 will face trial for involuntary manslaughter in @entity2 's death			1
prosecutors contend that @entity17 's should be held criminally responsible for giving the pop star a surgical anesthetic , propofol , at home without monitoring equipment			1
the coroner concluded @entity2 died from " acute propofol intoxication , " in combination " the contributory affects of the benzodiazepines , " @entity8 deputy district attorney @entity27 said			1
@entity17 allegedly delayed calling for help when he found @entity2 was not breathing , misled paramedics and doctors about the series of sedatives and the anesthetic he 'd given him and that he tried to hide evidence when he should have been trying to revive @entity2			1
@entity17 told paramedics he had only given @entity2 a dose of lorazepam to help him sleep and that he was treating him for dehydration , @entity7 testified			1
when he asked " how long the patient was down , " the doctor responded " ' it just happened , ' " @entity7 testified			0
the paramedic , however , said " it did n't add up			0
" testimony wednesday also included emotional accounts of crying and praying in the home as @entity2 's children and employees realized something was very wrong upstairs			2
@entity2 chef @entity54 said the first indication of a crisis was when @entity17 ran downstairs in a panic and asked her to send @entity2 's oldest son , @entity59 , and the security guard upstairs			1
" his eyes were enlarged , " @entity61 testified			0
" after the housekeepers started crying , the rest of the staff joined them , she said			0
" we started praying , " @entity61 said			0
" we held hands , and we were crying			0
" @entity2 's two oldest children , @entity59 and @entity70 , watched from a bedroom doorway as @entity17 tried to revive their father before the ambulance arrived , according to @entity74 , who worked on @entity2 's security team			1
" @entity70 screamed ' @entity76 ! ' and she started crying , " @entity74 testified			2
@entity2 's three sisters , parents and brother @entity80 listened from the second row of the @entity8 courtroom as @entity74 appeared to be near tears as he described the scene			1
" dr. @entity17 then said ' get them out , get them out			1
do n't let them see their father like this , ' " @entity74 said			0
" i turned to the children and i told them ' do n't worry , children , we 'll take care of it			0
' " @entity74 testified that @entity17 asked for his help in collecting medicines from around the bedroom			2
" he then grabbed a handful of bottles or vials , " @entity74 said			0
" he instructed me to put them in a bag			0
" it was only then , about 21 minutes after prosecutors say @entity17 realized @entity2 was not breathing , that he asked @entity74 to call for an ambulance			1
it arrived four minutes later			2
@entity2 's former security chief testified that @entity17 seemed not to know how to administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation as he waited for paramedics to arrive at the singer 's house			1
@entity112 said he and @entity74 saw @entity17 crouched next to @entity2 's bed " in a panicked state asking , ' does anyone know cpr ? ' " " i looked at @entity74 because we knew dr. @entity17 was a heart surgeon , so we were shocked , " @entity112 said			1
when defense lawyer @entity120 asked if perhaps @entity17 was only asking for help because he was tired , @entity112 said , " the way that he asked it is as if he did n't know cpr			2
" @entity74 testified that @entity17 told him and @entity112 that he was inexperienced at mouth - to - mouth resuscitation			2
" after the second time , he gave a breath , he said ' you know , this is the first time that i give mouth - to - mouth , but i have to do it , because he 's my friend , ' " @entity74 said			0
@entity2 appeared to be dead at that time , with his " eyes open and his mouth open , just laying there , " @entity112 said			1
@entity8 deputy district attorney @entity27 earlier said that @entity17 used " ineffectual cpr with one hand while the patient was prone on a soft bed			2
" using two hands with the patient prone on a hard surface is the proper method , he said			0
@entity112 , testifying tuesday , said he never saw @entity17 performing cpr on @entity2 before paramedics arrived and transported the singer to @entity143			1
the hearing , which began tuesday , is expected to last two or three weeks , with 20 to 30 witnesses testifying			0
judge @entity146 will determine whether there is probable cause to send @entity17 to trial			2
