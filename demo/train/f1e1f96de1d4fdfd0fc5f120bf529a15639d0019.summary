-- there 's a promising premise on the boil here			0
what if @entity5 ( 1809 - 1849 ) spent the last days of his life trying to nab a serial killer who 's been using macabre ideas from @entity5 's short stories to off his victims ? " @entity11 , " anyone ? ok , " @entity15 " sounds like a tv series that gets canceled soon after its debut			1
but it has compensations , chief of which is @entity20 , who plays @entity5 with just the right blend of romantic longing and tortuous doubt			1
director @entity24 ( " @entity28 " ) , an assistant to the @entity26 brothers on " @entity27 , " pulls us in with the period atmosphere			0
a few days before his death , @entity5 was found on a park bench in @entity33 , babbling incoherently			1
booze and syphilis reportedly contributed to @entity5 's demise			2
but the script , by @entity38 and @entity39 , posits that he 's been poisoned by a crazed fan who adores and loathes him in equal measure			0
cue the flashbacks and a feeble fictional story about how @entity5 's heiress fiancee , @entity45 ( @entity46 ) , gets interred alive ( " @entity47 " ) and @entity5 labors to help police detective @entity49 ( @entity50 ) find @entity45 before her breath runs nevermore			2
none of this huggermugger generates much excitement			0
what drew me into the film most was the depiction of @entity5 's life as an impoverished poet , trying to make a few bucks by composing detective fiction while fiercely criticizing the work of other writers			2
in one scene , the anguished @entity5 wagers that at least one person in a pub will recognize him as an author , best known for " @entity15			1
" @entity20 captures that desperation vividly enough to make you wish this was the real @entity5 story , which " @entity15 " onscreen leaves buried alive			1
