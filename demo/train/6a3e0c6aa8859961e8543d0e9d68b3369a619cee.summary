-- now , this is a weird one			2
on wednesday , @entity2 was a well - liked college football star			1
a day later , he was the butt of the latest internet fad -- posting pictures of yourself with your arm around an imaginary girlfriend			1
they call it " te'oing			2
" the nation was abuzz thursday with talk of @entity2 after the sports website @entity11 reported wednesday that the girlfriend @entity2 said died as his team marched toward the @entity17 not only did n't die -- she never existed			1
@entity2 , 21 , said wednesday that he 'd been tricked into an online relationship that ended with him being told the woman had died from leukemia			1
he said he 'd been taken in by a " sick joke			1
" @entity22 said @entity2 was the victim of an " elaborate hoax			1
" the @entity2 hoax , in 30 posts but many fans , sports experts and media critics took to the airwaves and the @entity30 , questioning that someone could pull the wool over @entity2 's eyes for so long , and saying he had to be in on it			1
" the level of hoax would have to be so elaborate that it really would strain credulity , " said @entity35 , host of @entity0 's " @entity36 " and @entity39 's @entity38 bureau chief			0
the media also took its share of lumps , with @entity35 and others questioning why reporters covering @entity2 's emotional tale did n't do more to check the young linebacker 's story			1
meanwhile , the story became overnight social media sensation , spawning a seemingly endless discussion of the whys and hows of the baffling case			2
and while none of those commenters claimed to have any inside knowledge , the @entity58 was front and center in many of those theories			1
@entity2 was among the top candidates for the trophy , which goes to the best college football player in the @entity68			1
" @entity2 faked having a girlfriend for @entity73 ! ! ! ! ! " tweeted @entity69 , one of many outraged fans to voice the sentiment			1
opinion : @entity2 tale a mirror to our gullibility ? others said such a plan would need years of impractical planning			1
" he most likely did n't make it up			2
to make it up , he 'd have to have been scheming enough to make it just elaborate enough and just the right story to get people to pay attention , " said a commenter using the handle @entity86 on a @entity0 story			2
" he 'd also have to have known that he would have played really well the exact game that she " died			0
" he 'd also have to be ( unfazed ) by it all			0
he 'd also have to have the ability to lie straight - faced			0
i just do n't think he is that smart or sneaky			2
" @entity98 is a @entity58 - winning former @entity99 running back and @entity102 star			1
he met @entity2 at the @entity58 ceremony and said he thought he was a good kid			1
asked to comment on the echo chamber online , @entity98 said , " i ca n't believe that it could be			1
" he added , " if it turns out that this was done for recognition and to get publicity for the @entity58 , that would be despicable , deplorable			1
" the @entity58 is a carefully choreographed mating dance			1
even before a season starts , universities erect billboards and create media strategies to announce to the world that they have an athlete worthy of the game 's most prestigious trophy			0
timeline : how the story unfolded while touchdowns and tackles are still the determining factors , a good storyline helps			2
and @entity2 's heart - wrenching tale of determination in the face of two tragedies -- the death of his grandmother and his girlfriend within hours -- had all the elements			1
it reached its apex on september 15 when he led the @entity137 to a 20 - 3 thrashing of @entity139			0
he credited the deaths in propelling him in the game in which he had 12 tackles , the most he had all season			0
" i will be honest , throughout the game you are still thinking about it , but football allows me to be in a little realm , a little world that i know , " he said afterward			0
" i can honor them by the way i played			0
it was for them , for my girl and my grandma , and for all my loved ones who have passed on			0
" sports fans lapped it up			0
he was a hero with a halo			0
until , that is , the article appeared on @entity11 , the same site that in 2010 published explicit pictures allegedly sent by @entity102 quarterback @entity162 to a @entity164 sideline host			0
now , he 's the butt of jokes and the center of swirling questions about whether he or someone else is behind the hoax			0
opinion : does @entity2 story make you laugh or cry ? @entity11 said it had traced the hoax to a former classmate of the woman whose face appears in the @entity180 profile of @entity2 's alleged girlfriend			1
the woman , according to @entity11 , had no knowledge of the hoax but said she recalled the classmate asking her to send him photos of herself similar to those used in the profile			0
@entity2 did not answer a call to his room at a @entity192 training facility , where he is preparing for the @entity102 combine			1
@entity0 has not been able to locate the man @entity11 named in its article as being behind the hoax			0
however , @entity2 tried to clear up some of the speculation with a statement wednesday			2
" this is incredibly embarrassing to talk about , but over several months i developed an emotional relationship with a woman i met online , " he said			0
" we maintained what i thought to be an authentic relationship by communicating frequently online and on the phone , and i grew to care deeply about her			0
" to realize that i was the victim of what was apparently someone 's sick joke and constant lies was , and is , painful and humiliating			1
" but @entity211 , a @entity212 sports columnist , said @entity2 has more explaining to do			2
" it does n't add up			0
obviously the explanation , it bears further explanation , " @entity211 said			0
" i think you want to hear from @entity2 himself beyond the statement			2
because if he is truly a victim of a cruel hoax , as @entity22 put it , then he has nothing to hide			0
" te'o in his own words			0

@entity227 : " te'oing " -- picturing a person with an imaginary girlfriend -- becomes a fad
some are questioning whether the girlfriend story was made up for publicity
" i ca n't believe that it could be , " says @entity98 , a @entity58 winner
@entity2 says he was the victim of a " sick joke "
