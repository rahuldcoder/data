-- my commitment to the cause of stopping the exploitation of children was born from a humbling experience			1
in 2002 , i witnessed the horrors of human trafficking as we rescued three trembling girls living on the impoverished streets of @entity12			2
preventing these girls from falling prey to this horrendous crime was a personal awakening			2
i thank @entity0 's heroes initiative for allowing the @entity18 to share and engage others in our commitment to end the exploitation of children by human trafficking and modern - day slavery			1
that was more than a decade ago			2
since then , i knew my foundation must shed a light on this taboo subject			2
education has been our pillar from the outset			1
in 2004 , we launched @entity33 , our principal project , to provide education and solutions for international efforts to eliminate child trafficking			1
this unscrupulous market -- which consists of 27 million victims worldwide , according to the 2011 @entity41 -- generates up to $ 32 billion annually , an amount rivaling that of the trafficking of arms and drugs			1
of the 27 million , @entity46 estimates that 1.2 million are children who are trafficked every year to work as forced labor , in the commercial sex industry , in prostitution and in other forms of slavery			1
many contest them because the crimes are hidden			2
but numbers do n't matter : preventing one or 200 children from traffickers validates our mission			1
no one should be exploited and deprived of his or her freedom			0
we believe every child has the right to be a child			0
as a young public charity , we have discovered we are not alone in this fight			0
we have been privileged to partner with groups such as @entity46 , @entity72 , @entity73 at @entity74 , the @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82			1
we joined forces with the @entity78 and the @entity84 to launch @entity85 and @entity86 , the first regional campaign to combat human trafficking in the @entity89			0
we received thousands of phone calls through our hot line and were able to help launch hundreds of investigations in five countries			0
unfortunately , atrocities committed against children have reached epidemic proportions on the @entity98			1
to prevent these crimes , we launched @entity100 , an online bilingual child safety website , that provides tools to protect children from pornography and sexual exploitation			1
more recently , we published " @entity106 in @entity107 : an @entity108 " in alliance with the @entity75 and @entity73			0
the pioneering investigation documents that too many minors in @entity107 are at risk of becoming exploited as sex slaves , as slave labor or used in pornography			1
such findings led us to focus on the development of creative solutions			0
we are developing our first @entity119 in @entity107 to serve as a safe haven for children and young people			1
we aim to transform their lives through a holistic approach			0
children and young people do not have a sufficiently loud voice in our society			2
to help change this , we continue to strengthen @entity131 by redoubling our investigation and awareness campaigns			0
our objective is to galvanize a movement to prevent this scourge			0
addressing such an abominable crime on a global scale is a daunting challenge			0
we need to tackle it one life at a time			0
i am convinced that small triumphs over a long period of time will eventually result in the type of social justice we must all strive for			0
human trafficking has no place in our world today			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity18 .			1
