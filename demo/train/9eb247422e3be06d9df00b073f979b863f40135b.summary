@entity0 -- the @entity2 notched a much - needed win in court friday after a series of setbacks over the legality and even the usefulness of its massive data collection program			1
a federal judge in @entity11 ruled the @entity2 's bulk collection of data on nearly every phone call made in the @entity15 was legal			1
the ruling contrasts with another ruling last week by a federal judge in @entity0 , who called the same program " almost orwellian " and likely unconstitutional			1
in his ruling friday , @entity15 district judge @entity21 said the @entity2 's bulk collection of phone records under @entity25 of the @entity26 was legal			1
the program was revealed in classified leaks by former @entity2 contractor @entity29			1
" but the question of whether that program should be conducted is for the other two coordinate branches of government to decide , " said the ruling by @entity32 , an appointee of president @entity33			2
the @entity38 , which brought the case , said it would appeal @entity32 's ruling			2
" we are extremely disappointed with this decision , which misinterprets the relevant statutes , understates the privacy implications of the government 's surveillance and misapplies a narrow and outdated precedent to read away core constitutional protections , " said @entity41 , the @entity38 's deputy legal director			1
review : @entity2 snooping program should stay in place president @entity52 is examining a review of the surveillance efforts that recommended changes in how the @entity2 program was conducted			1
@entity52 said last week he would decide what to do about it in january			0
last week , @entity15 district judge @entity59 said the @entity2 's bulk collection of metadata -- phone records of the time and numbers called without any disclosure of content -- apparently violates privacy rights			1
his preliminary ruling favored five plaintiffs challenging the practice , but @entity59 limited the decision only to their cases			0
" i can not imagine a more ' indiscriminate ' and ' arbitrary invasion ' than this systematic and high - tech collection and retention of personal data on virtually every citizen for purposes of querying and analyzing it without prior judicial approval , " said @entity59 , an appointee of president @entity73			0
" surely , such a program infringes on ' that degree of privacy ' that the @entity85 enshrined in the @entity86			0
" @entity59 's ruling said the " plaintiffs in this case have also shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits of a @entity86 claim , " adding " as such , they too have adequately demonstrated irreparable injury			0
" he rejected the government 's argument that a 1979 @entity98 case provided precedent for the constitutionality of collecting phone metadata , noting that public use of telephones had increased dramatically in three decades			1
@entity59 also noted the government " does not cite a single instance in which analysis of the @entity2 's bulk metadata collection actually stopped an imminent attack , or otherwise aided the government in achieving any objective that was time - sensitive in nature			1
" however , he put off enforcing his order barring the government from collecting the information , pending an appeal by the government			0
a @entity118 spokesman said in response to @entity59 's ruling that " we believe the program is constitutional as previous judges have found			0
" explosive revelations this year by @entity29 triggered new debate about national security and privacy interests in the aftermath of the september 2001 terrorist attacks			2
@entity29 's disclosures led to more public disclosure about the secretive legal process that sets in motion the government surveillance			1
the @entity2 has admitted it received secret court approval to collect vast amounts of metadata from telecom giant @entity137 and leading internet companies , including @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143			2
the case before @entity59 involved approval for surveillance in april by a judge at a @entity148 that handles individual requests for electronic surveillance for " foreign intelligence purposes			2
" under the @entity153 of the 1970s , the secret courts were set up to grant certain types of government requests -- wiretapping , data analysis and other monitoring of possible terrorists and spies operating in the @entity15			0
the @entity26 that @entity161 passed after the 9/11 attacks broadened the government 's ability to conduct anti-terrorism surveillance in the @entity15 and abroad , eventually including the metadata collection			2
in order to collect the information , the government has to demonstrate it is " relevant " to an international terrorism investigation			0
however , the 1978 @entity153 law lays out exactly what the special court must decide : " a judge considering a petition to modify or set aside a nondisclosure order may grant such petition only if the judge finds that there is no reason to believe that disclosure may endanger the national security of the @entity15 , interfere with a criminal , counterterrorism , or counterintelligence investigation , interfere with diplomatic relations , or endanger the life or physical safety of any person			0
" in defending the program , gen. @entity190 , the @entity2 's director , told the @entity192 last week that " 15 separate judges of the @entity148 have held on 35 occasions that @entity25 ( of the @entity26 ) authorizes the collection of telephony metadata in bulk in support of counterterrorism investigations			1
" initially , telecommunications companies such as @entity137 were the targets of legal action against @entity26 provisions			0
@entity161 later gave retroactive immunity to those private businesses			0
the @entity11 ruling makes it more likely that the @entity15 @entity207 will have to tackle the issue of privacy and settle the dispute over the the @entity2 program			1
for years , the courts have relied on a 1979 @entity207 precedent that found privacy rights did n't extend to personal information people give to third - parties such as the phone companies , which store basic data on calls made			1
the secret court that oversees the @entity153 has relied on that ruling to periodically reauthorize the @entity2 phone data program			1
but technology has come a long way since then ; modern cell phones are in constant communication with phone towers and tell a lot more information about phone customers than old land line phones			0
and at least some justices may be ready to take on the issue again			0
ruling last year in an unrelated case , @entity207 @entity234 wrote that the 1979 standard may be " ill suited to the digital age " because people reveal a lot more information in seemingly mundane tasks			2
" it may be necessary to reconsider the premise that an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to third parties , " she wrote			0
@entity1 's @entity249 and @entity250 contributed to this report .			0
