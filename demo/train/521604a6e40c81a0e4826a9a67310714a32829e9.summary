-- to hear spc. @entity2 tell it , the @entity1 forced her to make an agonizing choice between serving her country and taking care of her son			1
the @entity1 , however , takes issue with the soldier 's story and @entity2 could now be facing serious charges for desertion			1
when her unit deployed to @entity14 earlier in november , @entity2 was missing from the plane			1
her lawyer said she refused to go because there was no one to take care of her 10 - month - old son , @entity20 , and she feared he would be placed in foster care			2
the @entity1 said the young mother had plenty of time to sort out family issues and has been confined to her post at @entity28 , @entity29 , while an investigation unfolds			1
before shipping overseas , every soldier must sign military form d - a 53 - 05 , which states that failure to maintain a family care plan could result in disciplinary action			0
@entity2 had agreed to such a plan and her mother , @entity37 , took in @entity38 in a month before @entity2 's deployment date			1
but after a week with the infant , @entity37 , who cares for ailing relatives and runs a day - care out of her home , said she felt so overwhelmed that she backed out			0
" it was that hard , because he 's a very busy baby , " @entity37 told @entity0 affiliate @entity44 in @entity45 , @entity29			0
" you have to keep an eye on him 24 hours a day			0
" @entity2 's attorney , @entity51 @entity50 , said the soldier informed the @entity1 that her family care plan had fallen through and that there was no one to take care of @entity20			1
@entity28 spokesman @entity57 said @entity2 's unit had known for months about its pending deployment and that it was n't until the last minute that @entity2 notified the @entity1 of her child - care woes			1
like all soldiers who face similar circumstances , @entity2 received a 30 - day extension back in august and september , @entity57 said			2
that 's " plenty of time , " he said , " to work out another care plan			1
" on the eve of her unit 's departure , @entity2 was ordered to be on the plane			2
" that 's when it put her in this horrible situation of having to choose between abandoning her child or disobeying her superiors , " @entity50 said			0
" the sense i got from her and the reason i think why she was scared enough to not go and get on her plane was because they would take her child from her			0
" less than 24 hours after her fellow soldiers took off from @entity84 , @entity2 turned herself in and was arrested by military police			2
no charges have been filed			0
more than 30,000 single mothers have served in the @entity89 and @entity14 wars , according to a new report compiled by the @entity91			0
former air force jag officer @entity92 said @entity2 is not likely to win a legal battle with the @entity1			1
" when soldiers are ordered to deploy , and single soldiers included , they have to have a family care plan in place ... and they need to implement that , " she said			0
@entity0 's @entity100 and @entity101 contributed to this report			0
