-- @entity1 and the @entity2 sealed their places in the @entity6 finals in @entity7 next year while @entity8 survived an uncomfortable night in @entity9 against @entity10 in key qualifying matches tuesday			1
@entity12 scored the winner as @entity1 came from behind to beat the @entity14 2 - 1 to seal @entity15 , while the @entity16 had a pair of @entity19 goals to thank for a 2 - 0 win in @entity21 to wrap up @entity22 of @entity24 qualifying			1
@entity25 's @entity8 battled to a goalless draw to maintain their leadership of @entity28 , one point clear of @entity10 and @entity29 with two rounds of matches remaining			1
it was an unconvincing performance and visiting goalkeeper @entity33 was the busier goalkeeper in a match of few clear cut chances , but @entity36 , making his 100th appearance for @entity8 nearly grabbed the winner with a headed effort in injury time			2
@entity1 fell behind to a 19th minute @entity41 volleyed strike in @entity43 , but the @entity1 struck back through @entity44 in the 51st minute before @entity12 stepped up to hit the winner past @entity46 from the spot three minutes later to set the four - time champions on the road to @entity7			1
@entity50 's @entity12 had a mixed night , wasting several chances to put his side firmly in control , before winning the penalty as he was crudely fouled by @entity55			2
to complete an ultimately disappointing night for the @entity57 , @entity56 was given his marching orders near the end			0
" we 've qualified and we 're really satisfied , " said @entity1 coach @entity60			2
" tonight there were spells in which we suffered physically but we also played some quality football			0

fellow powerhouses @entity70 need just a single point from their final two matches to join them after a 3 - 0 win in the @entity74 , with @entity75 , @entity77 new boy @entity76 and @entity78 scoring the goals			1
@entity80 still have a mathematical chance of overhauling the @entity83 leaders after @entity85 's first minute goal in the 1 - 0 win in @entity87 , but the @entity88 can seal qualification next month when they play the @entity90			1
@entity91 are also all but assured of a finals place , five points clear of @entity94 in @entity95 as a pair of @entity98 goals saw off @entity99 2 - 0			1
@entity100 revived their hopes by breaking a scoring drought which had lasted 526 minutes in a fighting 4 - 2 win in the @entity105			2
@entity106 canceled out a @entity108 opener for the hosts and then equalized for the second time after @entity111 's effort			0
@entity112 and @entity113 grabbed vital late goals to clinch victory for the @entity116 , who draw level with world champions @entity120 on points in @entity122 @entity120 , who have played a game less , were salvaging a 2 - 2 draw with @entity126 in a friendly in @entity128 , equalizing for the second time in added time through @entity130			1
@entity131 netted twice for the @entity132 , with @entity134 striker @entity133 canceling out his first effort			0
@entity137 ' 3 - 0 home defeat to @entity138 in @entity139 was notable for the appearance of @entity142 's new world record signing @entity143 , who played for half an hour as a second half substitute and almost scored with a late free kick			1
@entity143 has not played since a pre season friendly for his former side @entity134 , nursing a foot injury			0
earlier , @entity150 won a marathon penalty shootout 9 - 8 with hosts @entity152 to qualify for an intercontinental playoff , with the winners reaching next year 's finals			2
they will play @entity132 's fifth placed team after a topsy turvy contest in @entity160			0
the home side went ahead through @entity162 and dominated much of the first half , only for @entity164 to level with a stunning half volley strike just before the interval			0
despite several chances for either side , the match went into extra time , which was delayed for 18 minutes by a floodlight failure			0
the penalty drama was intense until the unfortunate @entity162 failed to convert his effort to leave the visitors celebrating .			0

@entity1 and @entity2 seal spots in @entity6 finals in @entity7
@entity12 scores the winner as @entity1 beat @entity14
