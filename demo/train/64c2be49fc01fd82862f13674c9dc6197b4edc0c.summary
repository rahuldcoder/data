, and next year 's @entity7 extravaganza " @entity5			1
" despite all this , @entity1 's heart is really in writing			1
the actress , who first gained fame on the hit show " @entity13 , " recently spoke with @entity0 about " @entity4 " and her current career and plans			1
@entity0 : you 're now nearing the end of your journey on " @entity4 " " with " @entity21			1
" what attracted you to the role of @entity24 ? @entity1 : ' @entity4 ' was one of my favorite books as a kid			1
i was extremely honored to be representing @entity29 on the screen , and working with @entity31			1
working on that project is what inspired me to start writing [ her children 's book ] " the @entity37 " and get it published			1
it really got me moving and inspired me to set off and do something with my writing			1
@entity0 : @entity24 is an original character created for the movie			2
what was it like tackling that ? lilly : @entity24 was half as daunting as a character from the book			2
[ with ] @entity24 , there was no preconceived idea of who she should be			2
there was a lot of freedom to really play with it , and be open to my own interpretation of her			2
the scariest part was accepting the role in the first place -- i had to agree to play a character who would be very likely hated by most of the fans			2
once i decided ( that ) i did n't have to live up to anyone 's expectation of her , not knowing who she was			2
@entity0 : since she is not in the book , we do n't know what will become of her			2
lilly : we left her in a situation where she had betrayed her king , and we were n't sure where her heart was at			0
we start to realize where her alliances are , and who she cares about			0
is it the dwarf or @entity82 ? and she does more ass - kicking , which she does best			0
but there 's a lot more emotional material for @entity24 in this film , which is good to see			0
we get to know her better			0
@entity0 : what made you decide to make the leap to writing ? lilly : when i finished shooting " @entity4 , " i took two years off to be an author			1
a lot of that time was spent trying to help publish a limited edition run of 1,000 books for @entity101			0
then @entity102 swept in and said they would publish in 2014			0
when i started to work on " @entity5 , " it was a return to being an actor for a little while			1
i was curious to see how it was -- and if there was a part of me that missed it			0
ultimately , my reaction was , " @entity111 , i ca n't wait to get back to full - time writing			1
" there 's nothing as pleasurable to me as writing			1
it was great affirmation that i was making the right choice and going in the right direction			0
@entity0 : so you see yourself doing less and less acting ? lilly : @entity121 has always been something that happened , but never something i dreamed about and pursued			1
i was fortunate to have such a wonderful job fall into my lap. if this was n't the right fit -- an amazing job that most people would covet -- i thought that writing would be that			2
i think i was right			0
@entity0 : you just wrapped " @entity5			1
" what was that experience like ? lilly : i 've been astounded to discover how good to their teams and crew that @entity7 are			0
they 're so collaborative , so smart with their stories			0
they have rich , dynamic characters which are so much fun to play			0
i expected i 'd be a cog in the wheel of a big machine -- i was n't sure i 'd like this experience			2
but i 've been so astounded at how pleasurable the whole experience has been			0
@entity0 : who is your character , @entity151 ? lilly : she is the daughter of the founders of @entity154 , @entity5 and the @entity155			1
she is a very talented , intelligent , capable woman and a force to be reckoned with			0
this one is very much a heist film			0
it has all the fun , tension and drama of a good heist film			0
the heist is being masterminded by myself , my father and @entity5 .			1
