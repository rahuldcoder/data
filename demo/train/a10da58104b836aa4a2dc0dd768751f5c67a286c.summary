@entity0 -- @entity3 archaeologists have discovered the 1,000 - year - old boat burial of a @entity6 warrior in the @entity7			1
the man was laid to rest inside his boat , surrounded by valuable items including an ornately - decorated sword , a shield , a spear and an ax -- all of which suggest he was of high status			1
experts say the find -- the first fully intact grave of its kind on the @entity3 mainland -- may be part of one of the country 's most significant @entity6 sites			1
" a @entity6 boat burial is an incredible discovery , " said project co-director and archaeologist dr @entity27 , from the @entity30			1
" but in addition to that , the artifacts and preservation make this one of the most important norse graves ever excavated in @entity3			1
" archaeologists from several universities have spent the past six years carrying out digs at a number sites on the remote @entity42 , on @entity44 's west coast			2
they are aiming to trace the whole history of the area , from the first traces of human habitation 6,000 years ago to the present			0
previous excavations nearby have uncovered a @entity52 tomb , a @entity54 monument , and a 19th century site linked to the @entity56			0
but dr @entity57 of the @entity58 , one of the project 's leaders , said the boat burial was " the best of the bunch			2
" " it 's absolutely fantastic -- the find of a lifetime , " he told @entity1			0
" it is very rich , very old , the sort of thing i dreamed of excavating as a boy			0
" other grave goods found with the @entity6 included a knife , flints , a bronze ring pin from @entity75 , a whetstone from @entity77 , and items of pottery from the @entity80			1
the team also excavated hundreds of metal rivets , which would have held together the @entity6 's boat -- the wood of which had rotted away over the centuries			2
@entity57 said the objects gave tantalizing clues to the identity of the man buried at @entity42			2
" of course , we will never know his name , or anything like that , but we can tell he was an important figure , a man of very high status , and somebody with international connections , links to lots of different places , but also to the local area , " he said			1
the archaeologist said he and the rest of the team planned to return to the site again next summer to carry out further investigations			0
" this was just one burial , but it is part of a much larger story , " he said			0
" there are many more questions to answer			0
we want to find out if there are others , or if people were living in settlements nearby , so we will be back there next year			0
