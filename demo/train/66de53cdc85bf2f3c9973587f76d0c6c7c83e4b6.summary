@entity0 , @entity1 -- the numbers are staggering and the prospects are scary as a still - growing @entity1 wildfire menaces @entity0 and @entity7 's water supply			1
the tourist hotspot @entity9 and its iconic attractions , including the @entity12 rock formation , currently are safe , miles from the @entity14 's reach			1
however , the blaze was on the edge of the @entity17 , which serves 2.6 million customers in the @entity19			1
water quality remains unchanged , despite ash that has fallen on the 459 - square - mile reservoir , because the water is drawn from a depth of 260 feet , according to the @entity25			1
the city was already transferring 275 million gallons of water daily from @entity29 to other reservoirs because @entity29 is full , but as a precautionary measure , the city increased that amount by 27 million gallons , a tuesday statement said			1
the commission said it was confident the @entity14 would not affect the reservoir : " due to the rocky , granite terrain and limited brush along the perimeter of the reservoir , there is little risk for direct water quality impacts			1
" the fire could threaten the area 's hydroelectric generators , which provide much of @entity7 's electricity			1
because of the approaching flames , officials shut down the generators , and the city -- more than 120 miles to the west -- temporarily is getting power from elsewhere			2
" all of @entity7 's municipal electric customers continue to be fully supplied ; there will be no interruption in electric service , " the commission said			2
the @entity14 , which has devoured about 184,000 acres , was still only 20 % contained as of tuesday evening			1
it is the seventh largest blaze in @entity1 's recorded history			2
" there 's a lot of concern , and there 's a lot of work to be done , " @entity59 spokesman @entity58 said			2
firefighters on tuesday were able to build fire lines in several locations			2
evacuations were ordered south of @entity70 , north of @entity71 and along the highway 108 corridor between @entity73 and @entity74			2
" access and difficult terrain remain concerns for crews and equipment , " said an incident report			2
" rapid fire growth and extreme fire behavior are hampering suppression efforts			2
" as many as 20 helicopters and @entity86 and @entity87 air tankers were aiding the efforts of 3,800 firefighting personnel			0
a top priority is stopping the fire from spreading farther in @entity0			0
a portion of @entity93 in the park will be closed for several days beginning wednesday so that firefighters can perform fire suppression			1
" the work that will be performed over the next few days is instrumental in suppressing the @entity14 within @entity0			1
the safety of the firefighters working along the road is our paramount concern , " park superintendent @entity98 said in a statement			1
@entity106 and @entity107 campgrounds , both located along @entity93 , will remain closed			0
@entity0 fire : blaze spreads to national park @entity0 , with hundreds of campground sites and lodging units , had nearly 4 million visitors last year , the @entity112 said			0
the park typically has 15,000 visitors on a busy summer weekend			0
while the @entity14 has consumed at least 12,000 acres in the northwest section of the park , it has had little or no direct impact on @entity9 , a popular spot for tourists and home to many of the famous cliffs and waterfalls in the park			1
the park has closed a few roads , campgrounds and wildlife trails while restricting smoking and building camping or cooking fires in wilderness areas			0
about 5,500 structures , many of them vacation homes , were under threat , according to @entity141 , a federal website that collects information from agencies such as the @entity59 and @entity145			1
the fire has cost more than $ 20 million , @entity58 said			0
thirty - one residences and 80 outbuildings have been destroyed			0
wildfire threatens 90 - year - old cabin the inferno threatened the @entity0 gateway communities of @entity153 and @entity154 just outside the @entity155			0
" business is slow , very slow , " said @entity156 , owner of the @entity157 in @entity153			0
her normal season is @entity160 to @entity161			0
" this is time we manage to save up money to make it through the winter , so it 's really scary for all of us , " she said , sitting among empty tables			0
the @entity169 , meanwhile , issued evacuation advisories for the town of @entity73 and nearby @entity172 , @entity141 said			0
it was not clear how many residents were covered by the evacuation advisory			1
authorities say the @entity14 started on august 17			1
the cause is under investigation			0
