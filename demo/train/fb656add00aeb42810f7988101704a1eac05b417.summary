the attack by @entity3 's @entity2 affiliate group @entity1 that killed scores at the @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7 , was horrifying			1
it was followed by two smaller scale attacks by the group that killed and injured both police and civilians			2
previously , a multilateral campaign against @entity1 undertaken by @entity16 's sanctioned @entity15 forces , including many from the @entity7 military , was being touted as a great counterinsurgency success story , both for the @entity15 and the @entity20			1
indeed , the @entity22 administration directly backed the @entity15 forces , participated in the counterinsurgency with targeted drone and air strikes and recently formally recognized the new @entity2 government			2
beginning in 2011 , the counterinsurgents pushed @entity1 out of @entity2 's capital , @entity30 , and made it nearly impossible for @entity1 to hold territory even in its former strongholds in southern @entity2			1
this was a stunning turnaround for parts of @entity2			2
despite these major counterinsurgent victories , many analysts interpret the recent attacks as a sign of a resurgent @entity1			1
the @entity42 , for instance , reports that according to senior @entity20 counterterrorism and diplomatic officials the attack shows the @entity2 militants are as dangerous as ever			1
if @entity1 , with its increasing ties to global jihadi groups , is capable of such spectacular attacks , the argument goes , it is stronger than we thought			1
@entity53 was declared too soon			0
nothing could be further from the truth			0
the goal of @entity1 is to rule @entity2			1
in order to do so , it must hold territory			0
by holding territory rebel groups establish political control , build operational capacity and gain recruits			0
terrorism is a tactic used to spread fear			0
it is not a tactic suited to holding territory			0
so , in analyzing the attack in @entity7 , one must ask why @entity1 has resorted to a tactic so ill - suited to its goals			1
the answer is that terrorist and other unconventional attacks are now all that @entity1 can manage , precisely because of the success of the counterinsurgent campaign against it			1
terrorism is a weapon of the weak			1
rebel groups turn to terrorism when they lack the human and material resources required to field a fighting force capable of using conventional tactics that might actually take and hold territory			2
that is , terrorist attacks are a sign that rebels are losing -- not winning			1
this is a pattern that has been seen repeatedly throughout the history of counterinsurgency			0
brutal but effective @entity96 counterinsurgency efforts in the second @entity98 war degraded @entity98 rebels ' public support and operational capacity			0
in response , those rebels shifted tactics , resulting in dramatic terrorist attacks in the @entity106 in 2010			1
those attacks , though deadly , were a sign of a @entity98 rebellion no longer able to seriously challenge @entity96 counterinsurgents			2
after the @entity114 offensive during the @entity115 , when @entity20 and @entity117 operations rested local control over a village , mobilization for the @entity112 declined in those villages and , as a result , conventional attacks by the @entity112 decreased and unconventional attacks by the @entity124 increased			0
the rise of the @entity126 as a terrorist organization can be largely attributed to similar dynamics			0
after its defeat in the civil war of the early 1920s , the remaining @entity126 rebels , unable to field a conventional fighting force capable of conventional operations against @entity137 and @entity136 forces , turned to terrorist tactics and assassinations			2
counterinsurgency is a strategically complex business			0
rebels shift tactics and strategies in response to changes to their operational environment			0
consequently , it is a mistake to expect that every counterinsurgent victory will be followed by a reduction in all forms of violence			0
we must learn to recognize when an uptick in violence is really a sign of resurgence and when it is a sign of a rebel group on its heels , fighting for survival			1
terrorist attacks by groups like @entity1 that used to control large amounts of territory are an instance of the latter phenomenon			1
no rebel group loses quietly			0
but governments must show resolve in the face of attacks , which should be understood for what they are â€” a sign the counterinsurgents are winning .			2

the @entity2 group @entity1 attacked a mall and other targets in @entity7 , killing many
@entity182 : these terrorist attacks are a sign the rebels are losing
he says the goal of @entity1 is to rule @entity2 , so why would it attack @entity7 ?
@entity190 : terrorism is a weapon of the weak ; @entity1 is fighting for its survival
