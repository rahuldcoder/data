-- the sales director for a supplier to @entity3 is close to despair			0
she has been selling parts for 20 years but now , she said , more people than ever needed to be bribed to guarantee orders			2
" in the past , we would give a purchasing manager a red envelope			0
but now even assembly line workers will call me threatening that if we do n't pay up they will find some problem with our product , " she said , asking to remain anonymous for fear of the potential consequences			2
" the rot has reached the roots			0
" her exasperation is shared by many			0
@entity20 is gripped by a sense that corruption has never been as bad as it is today and that it has started to shake the very foundations of the country 's economic development			1
@entity26 , who became president on thursday , has been driving an anti-graft campaign ever since he took over as communist party chief in november			2
mr @entity26 identified fighting corruption as a priority in his first speech as leader and has promised to show no leniency over an issue that he and others have warned could be a threat to the party 's rule			1
@entity40 has subsequently cracked down on the flood of gifts and banquets from which even small - time party officials have benefited			0
and , at the annual session of the @entity48 , the rubber - stamp parliament that has been meeting in @entity40 this week , mr @entity26 's approach has raised hopes that tougher rhetoric will translate into systemic reform			1
" we have received indications that the @entity59 will put a broad anti-corruption law on its legislative agenda for the coming five years , " said @entity52 , an @entity48 delegate and long - time campaigner for legislation to force officials to publicly declare their assets			1
but the problem runs far beyond officialdom			0
according to @entity65 , @entity20 people say corruption is at its worst in the private sector			1
in the group 's @entity69 , the sector scored worse than the civil service , judiciary or the police			1
@entity74 did not respond to requests for comment about the claims made by the supplier 's sales director about its @entity20 joint venture			1
the executive said her company gave her @entity83 , 000 ( $ 3,300 ) for handouts during lunar new year , when cash gifts in red envelopes is traditionally given in a practice often used as a cloak for bribery			0
even so , she said , she struggled to meet the ballooning demand for new year gifts from even lowly employees at the @entity74 joint venture on the outskirts of @entity40			0
" the @entity95 only occupy the top layer of management , and everything below that is done by @entity20 , the @entity20 way			2
the @entity95 do n't know , " she said			0
although @entity20 has many laws and regulations banning corruption , the country has long struggled to contain it among officials			1
@entity107 , deputy head of the @entity48 's law committee , said further anti-corruption legislation would be one of the focal points of the congress 's work in the coming years			1
plenty of people remain sceptical about the party 's willingness to root out corruption			1
a bout of transparency would be likely to reveal graft at the very top of the party and @entity40 has reacted angrily in recent months to scrutiny by international news organisations , including @entity126 and the @entity127 , of the wealth of mr @entity26 's family and that of @entity130 , the outgoing premier			2
reformists are not giving up , however			0
mr @entity52 failed for seven years in a row to get a proposal making it mandatory for officials to disclose their assets on the @entity48 's agenda			1
this year , however , he has changed tack			0
he now believes that waiting for asset declaration requirements to be included in a broader law is more realistic as it would give the leadership more time			1
any change is likely to take time			0
legal experts say @entity20 will probably have to amend parts of its criminal code and several other laws in the process			2
even those who believe that change is possible think that means it will take a decade before it becomes reality			0

people in @entity20 say corruption is worse than ever
@entity20 's new president has promised to root out graft
some remain skeptical that reforms will *materialize*
@entity48 delegate @entity52 is calling for asset declaration requirements for officials
