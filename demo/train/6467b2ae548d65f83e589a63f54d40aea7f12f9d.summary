-- ahead of the rain - lashed vehicles , tree branches lay across the road			2
we 'd encountered countless military , police and vigilante checkpoints but now we were in @entity9 's backyard , we worried if the checkpoints were being replaced by ambushes			1
after the kidnapping of more than 200 schoolgirls from a school in northern @entity17 , the whole world 's attention was focused on one village - @entity18 -- but @entity0 was the first news organization to send a team to the scene of the atrocity			1
setting up interviews with those impacted by the mass abduction was quite a task , but once in place , the bigger challenge became " how do we safely get there			2
" i have covered conflict zones before and always focus on the stories we 'll hope to get , rather than the potential danger			2
that 's how i deal with the fear			2
we were trying to find security escorts , but no one was willing to journey to @entity18 , which is situated in @entity40 -- one of the three states considered to be the heartland of @entity9			1
the militant @entity44 group has bombed schools , churches and mosques ; kidnapped women and children ; and assassinated politicians and religious leaders			2
it was unlikely they would welcome @entity55 journalists , and those accompanying us , with open arms			2
the journey from the relative safety of @entity17 's capital , @entity61 , to the remote countryside stalked by @entity9 can take 8 to 10 hours , but logistics and security concerns meant that it took us four days			1
we traveled in two cars -- 4x4s to handle the terrain			2
even before we reached the militant - plagued area , we suffered setbacks			2
in @entity71 , a tire on the first car blew - out , causing it to lose control			2
now we were down one car			2
it was hours before we could find a resident willing to lend his rundown car to us and to travel to @entity18			1
eventually this car broke down and had to be abandoned			0
' why did i come ? ' when we entered @entity40 , we were hit by a violent storm			1
we could see absolutely nothing as strong rains lashed our vehicles			0
@entity86 had fallen , we were still far away from our destination of the state capital @entity89 and our driver was unfamiliar with the road			0
we could n't see to the side , behind or ahead			0
while covering stories in other conflict zones , there have been instances when the danger was so apparent that i wondered - " why did i come ? " for this story , it was that night as we entered @entity40 -- in the dark during a strong storm			1
the situation was all the more eerie because the storm had brought down branches across the road and we wondered if we were being set up for an ambush			0
eventually , however , we did arrive in the relative safety of @entity89 , the state 's capital , only to encounter another hurdle			0
we had organized a police escort to accompany us for the final , most dangerous leg from @entity89 south to @entity18			1
the road is notorious for ambushes and attacks by @entity9			1
as we readied to journey along it on our third day , our police escort said they could not take us because that morning it had been the scene of a shootout between the militants -- who had come from raiding a village - and security forces			1
one of the officials had been shot in the neck			0
beyond the checkpoints by the time we left with a police escort the following day , it was about noon			1
our route had all been tarmac until the town of @entity134 , from where the road leads to @entity18			1
from that point , there 's no tarmac whatsoever			0
drivers are forced to swerve left and right to avoid the potholes caused by the heat and it 's really rough terrain -- savannah			0
@entity134 also hosted the last security checkpoint we encountered			0
prior to that we had been forced to stop constantly			0
there would be a military checkpoint , a few minutes later a police checkpoint and then a few minutes later a vigilante checkpoint -- staffed by local men armed with machetes looking out for @entity9			1
but on the road to the village now the focus of the whole world 's attention because of the atrocity that took place there -- there was nothing , not one checkpoint			1
we were driving through a vast area of open land , high grass and shrubs			0
and there was no homestead in sight			0
any checkpoint set up by the security forces would basically make them sitting ducks for the insurgents			0
our convoy was on its own			0
our police escorts were armed with @entity182 rifles and we had flak jackets on the seats beside us -- kept out of sight so as not to raise questions about our purpose -- but our main defense was to drive as fast as possible along the pitted road for the 45 - minute journey			1
a number of thoughts went through my mind ; this was the road to @entity18 ; militants could storm us from anywhere on that road			1
it was a very scary moment			0
and at the same time i kept thinking , " how is it possible that there is no single security check point towards this village ? not even one ? " arriving in @entity18 we found a spread - out village with a vibrant market with residents buying and selling food stuffs			1
the most popular stand , however , is the phone charging stand - because there is no power in the homes			0
overnight stay our late departure meant we had arrived in @entity18 around 3pm and the police said it was too dangerous to return along the same road so we had to sleep over in the village			1
that was n't part of the plan			2
we were offered guest huts to stay in			0
but we declined as our presence would be so obvious -- and of course we did n't want to be with the police because if there was an attack that would be where a shootout would be			0
a very brave local family hosted us , providing us with mats to sleep outside			0
a village that has lost so much still found reserves of humanity to offer us hospitality			2
during the day , @entity18 looks like a normal village			1
but at night is when you see the fear and terror			0
the women , elderly and children go to sleep			0
and the young men stay awake , doing patrols , keeping vigil			0
@entity0 's team joined them , and discovered that one thing was clear : @entity18 residents have stopped waiting for the government , they are protecting their own			1
see @entity250 's report on the @entity18 night patrol			1
see @entity250 's report on a @entity17 girl who escaped @entity9 .			1

on april *14* , @entity9 militants abducted more than 200 girls from a school in @entity17
the schoolgirls had been sleeping at the school in @entity18 , in *northeastern* @entity40
*producer* @entity261 was part of a @entity0 team that spent four days traveling to the village
they passed numerous checkpoints until the final 45 minute leg to chibok itself
