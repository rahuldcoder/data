@entity0 -- the dinner was billed as a " @entity3			0
" the honorees : justices @entity5 and @entity7			1
the hosts : the @entity9 , an influential conservative legal group whose membership includes judges , lawmakers and government officials			2
little news was made at the society 's recent three - day convention , but the appearance of perhaps the @entity21 's most right - leaning members was buzzworthy and just the latest chapter in what can be read as both drama and farce : the future of health care reform in the @entity28 and the sideline war over who will be on hand to decide it			0
the high - stakes legal fight will be argued by the nine - member bench in march , with a ruling expected by june			1
and if advocates on both sides of the debate have their way , perhaps only seven , even six justices could decide what shapes up to be the biggest constitutional fight in a decade			0
the timing of @entity5 's and @entity7 ' appearance especially outrages liberals , coming as it did just hours after the court privately agreed to accept the health care cases for review			1
there have been calls for @entity5 and especially @entity7 to recuse themselves or pull out of hearing the issue			1
and from the right : similar demands of justice @entity55			1
as a top member of president @entity60 's @entity59 last year , conservatives allege , she may have been more involved than once believed in preparing legal strategy for the health care appeals just before she was chosen for the high court			2
none of the justices appear ready to step aside , something many legal analysts say is both proper and expected			1
" we have attacks on both justices on the right , like @entity7 , and on the left , @entity55 , trying to influence the outcome of cases by getting them to recuse , " said @entity73 , a @entity0 lawyer and founder of @entity75			1
" particularly , we see this in the health care litigation that 's coming to the @entity21			2
all of those efforts are doomed			0
the justices realize that they need to participate in the case , it 's their constitutional duty , and i think this is just political posturing , on both sides , by activists			1
" losing just one justice could make a difference a loss of just one justice from ruling on an issue like health care would be huge , making a difference perhaps in the ultimate outcome			2
no wonder activists have launched a political and legal war to try to manipulate the judicial playing field to each side 's advantage			1
and why should outside groups have all the fun ? to no one 's surprise , members of @entity105 also demand a piece of the action			0
@entity111 chairman @entity110 , @entity112 , demanded last week that the attorney general be more forthcoming about @entity55 's involvement			1
" the public has a right to know both the full extent of @entity55 's involvement with this legislation while she was ( the @entity59 's ) solicitor general , as well as her previously stated views and opinions about the legislation while she was serving as solicitor general , " @entity110 wrote			1
@entity125 leader @entity124 and three other senators echoed calls for more records on @entity55 's government correspondence			1
the 51 - year - old @entity55 was the administration 's top government lawyer handling appeals to the @entity21			1
her nomination by @entity60 in may 2010 , and the weeks leading up to it , came at a time when @entity105 had passed -- and the president signed -- the @entity136			0
the health care reform law would significantly change how @entity28 receive medical services and has been the subject of six current appeals pending at the high court			0
twenty - eight states and dozens of individual plaintiffs have opposed the law			0
during her confirmation hearings to the high court last year , @entity55 said she sat in " at least one meeting where the existence of the litigation was briefly mentioned , but none where any substantive discussion of the litigation occurred			1
" the @entity153 has long insisted that she was " walled off " from involvement in the internal health care law discussions			0
after two conservative groups sued , the department turned over some documents related to @entity55			1
one e-mail from her to fellow department official @entity161 talked about an upcoming @entity153 vote on health care : " i hear they have the votes , @entity166 ! ! simply amazing			0
" another e-mail from her deputy at the time , @entity170 , indicated that @entity55 asked her office " to be involved in this set of issues			1
" that , says conservative lawyer @entity174 , proves that @entity55 is " the justice who knew too much			1
" " the president is now asking her to adopt the very same positions her office helped craft for him on this matter , but this time , as a @entity21 justice , " said @entity182 , of the @entity183			0
" her jump from advocate to judge on the same issue raises profound questions about the propriety of her continued participation in his case			2
moreover , the legitimacy of any decision where she is in the majority or plurality would be instantly suspect if she chooses not to recuse herself			2
" @entity182 is a former law clerk to @entity7 , himself the target of attacks on the left			1
@entity7 ' wife opposed health care law congressional democrats have separately called on @entity7 to pull out , citing his recent lapse in reporting the income of his wife for 13 straight years , as required by federal disclosure laws			1
the justice said the information was " inadvertently omitted , " and his defenders note that his wife 's employment history for a variety of conservative causes was widely publicized			0
@entity215 had worked for , and later founded , her own advocacy group , @entity216			0
since she has openly opposed the health care bill , many liberals have said , her political activities raise questions about justice @entity7 ' own judicial independence and impartiality			1
" to believe that @entity7 did n't know how to fill out a basic disclosure form is absurd , " said rep. @entity223 , @entity225 - @entity224 , on behalf of 20 colleagues			1
" i can not determine guilt or innocence , but i can request that the government do our due diligence in investigating a situation that strikes me , and many members of @entity105 , as suspicious			0
" @entity223 separately has asked the @entity59 and judiciary 's administrative office to investigate			0
@entity7 ' liberal colleagues -- current justice @entity238 and retired justice @entity239 -- have recently defended him , suggesting that he can hear the health care cases with impartiality			2
progressive groups @entity243 and @entity244 say the @entity5 / @entity7 celebratory dinner was a " stunning breach of ethics			1
" the @entity9 event , say liberals , was nothing more than a fundraiser , with donors that included pharmaceutical company @entity254			0
" the justices were wining and dining at a black - tie fundraiser with attorneys who have pending cases before the court , " @entity243 president @entity255 said			0
" their appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undercuts any claims of impartiality and is unacceptable			0
" among those on the official program for the dinner were @entity270 and attorney @entity271 , himself a former solicitor general , who will argue the health care cases as a private lawyer on behalf of a coalition of two dozen states			0
justices ultimately make the call unlike other members of the federal judiciary , the justices decide for themselves whether a conflict of interest exists , requiring disqualification			0
the binding @entity284 of @entity28 judges requires recusal when " impartiality might reasonably be questioned , " including having a family member directly involved in the case or if there is a financial interest , such as a justice owning stock in company being sued			2
in @entity55 's case , the code also demands recusal if a judge -- while serving in government -- " participated as counsel , adviser or material witness concerning the proceeding or expressed an opinion concerning the merits of the particular case or controversy			1
" as a result , the newest justice had decided on her own to withdraw from considering at least 28 other cases the high court eventually accepted for review			0
the court by tradition will not openly discuss when to recuse , and that is true with @entity7 , @entity55 and @entity5			1
it also will not speculate on the outcome of cases or succumb to political or legal analysis			2
the written opinion will be the only way the court will officially speak			0
" while the health care cases have huge political overtones , obviously , i think the justices are probably going to put them to the side , " said @entity75 's @entity73			2
" the legal stakes are so high that i do n't think they 'll pay attention that much , if at all , to the fact that it 's occurring in an election cycle			2
they have just got to get the case right			2
" not having to explain themselves when ethical issues arise has led to well - meaning criticism to justices are ultimately accountable to no one , perhaps too arrogant or detached to see warning signs , that may do ultimate damage to the prestige and well - earned independence the courts have earned			0
but saying nothing or doing nothing in the face of such criticism is the familiar chosen path of a justice , whose professional and personal makeup urges a cautious , detached approach			0
for @entity7 and @entity55 , that will probably be enough to keep them participating in the health care scrum			1
for them , the bigger fights are not from outside but within the marbled walls of the court itself : the competitive , often ruthless internal command for a five - vote majority			0
all else is a mere prologue to a story nine robed people will soon be writing .			0

@entity7 , @entity55 and @entity5 are at center of legal , political battle over case
many have called for them to recuse themselves or step aside during ruling
*opponents* cite previous litigation , political ties to *key* *stakeholders*
