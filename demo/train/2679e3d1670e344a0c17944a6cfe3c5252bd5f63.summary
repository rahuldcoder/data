-- it was supposed to be a unique way to engage with their fans via social media -- but for @entity8 's most successful soccer club it turned into the ultimate public relations own goal			1
@entity11 , who can boast 22 @entity8 league titles and have four times been crowned champions of @entity16 , revealed they would be unveiling a " spectacular " new signing on thursday -- a snippet of news to excite any fan			1
but when the announcement was made , on their official @entity23 page , it turned out to be a new marketing tool that displayed users of the social networking site as the new signing			1
the gimmick immediately led to a backlash from angry supporters , who bombarded the club 's @entity23 page with over 5,000 largely negative comments -- forcing @entity11 into a hasty retreat , complete with an apology			1
according to one sports pr expert , @entity11 's concept was clever , but their execution undoubtedly missed the target			2
" the idea of enticing people online is a nice one but the fundamental problem is you do n't do that so they end up feeling disappointed , " @entity41 , founder of communications agency @entity42 , told @entity0			0
" what @entity11 have failed to understand is the passion football fans have for their team and their excitement about getting a new striker			0
" they feel like they 've been taken for a fool and what you ca n't do with fans is take them for a fool , you need to respect them as integral to the club and that brand			0
they 've not thought it through very well			0
" within hours of their ' announcement ' @entity11 had posted the following statement on their @entity23 page : " sorry dear fans , as we see from your numerous comments , you are very upset about today 's action			1
" it was not our intention to disappoint you with the new app. rather , we wanted to provide you with this action and thus show how important each fan is for @entity11			0
" most of @entity16 's top clubs have a @entity79 account and a @entity23 page , and are slowly grappling with how best to utilize them to interact with fans and grow their brand			2
but though @entity11 's brainwave is novel and they can certainly claim to have got their message out to the masses -- it appears like they have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory			2
@entity41 added : " we all say you 've got to be part of the conversation ; with fans it is so important to have an equal understanding of their views so you 're part of that conversation			0
" so what is the expert 's view on the best way for @entity11 to extricate themselves from this public relations mess ? " go and sign a very good striker tomorrow ! "			1
