@entity0 , @entity1 -- tuesday 's election in the littlest of states is causing the biggest of stirs			1
when president @entity9 hits the campaign trail here friday to lend his star power to @entity13 , the first - time candidate running in the city 's deadlocked mayoral race , he wo n't be the most famous politician in the @entity1 that day			1
that distinction belongs to the politician running against @entity13 , the larger than life man who 's never lost a political race , the man who served as @entity0 's mayor twice before -- and who was forced to resign each time in disgrace : @entity24			1
" you 're not going to get a @entity26 or an @entity27 by saying ' @entity24 is a convicted felon			2
' @entity24 told @entity2 at his @entity0 headquarters this week			1
" he added : " i 'm probably the most vetted candidate in @entity32 right now			0
they know everything about me			0
" @entity24 , a back - slapping machine politician reminiscent of a bygone era , served as the city 's mayor from 1975 to 1984 and then again from 1991 to 2002 , epochs recalled locally as @entity39 and @entity40 @entity39 came crashing down after @entity24 was convicted of using a fire log and a lit cigarette to assault a man he accused of having an affair with his wife			1
@entity47 ended after @entity24 was convicted on federal corruption charges			2
at the end of his 2002 trial , the judge rebuked @entity24 before sentencing him to federal prison for five years			2
" in this mayor 's two administrations , there has been more corruption in the city of @entity0 than in the history of this state , " said judge @entity53			1
@entity24 is n't shying away from his past			2
" i 've made mistakes in my life obviously , i 've paid the price , " he told @entity2			1
" we all stumble , i stumbled			0
that does n't prevent me from running for office ... i 've done my time , and i think i 'm a contributing member to this society and this city			1
" while @entity24 's stumbles did n't prevent him from running for office , his 37 - year - old opponent hopes that they 'll prevent him from capturing it			1
" we have a storied history of corruption here in our city , " @entity13 said at a recent press conference			0
" and those incidents of corruption are very well - documented in mr. @entity24 's administration			1
" three former @entity32 attorneys -- among them current @entity32 sen. @entity84 -- doubled down on those sentiments , urging voters to reject @entity24 at a press conference they convened october 14			2
" i would very much doubt that the return of this particular shadow would do our applications any good , " said @entity84 , referring to federal grant applications			0
but for @entity47 , it 's a familiar refrain			0
in fact , it 's @entity24 's past -- warts and all -- that lay at the heart of the campaign message driving the 73 - year - old 's " final rodeo " -- the quest for a @entity102 " they can talk all they want about me and my background , " he said			1
" the question is : if you went into a hospital and you had to have open heart surgery , would you want the intern to do it or would you want the experienced doctor even though the doctor might have had a couple of problems in his life ? everyone in @entity0 it seems has an opinion about @entity24 , and they typically fall into one of three categories			1
there are those that love him , such as @entity126			0
" i think of him as a @entity128			0
" i just think he should be given another chance			0
" there are those that do n't			0
" @entity24 is someone who 's very flashy , " said @entity135			1
" i think it 's all show with him , there 's not any substance behind what he does			0
" then there are the conflicted			0
@entity24 " is someone who is incredibly charming , actually very intelligent , very funny , ( and ) very glib , " said @entity143			0
" but somebody who i would never vote for for mayor			0
" " i think @entity24 loves this city and that he did some good things for this city , " added @entity135			0
" i just do n't think this city needs somebody like him at this point in time where @entity0 and @entity1 in general needs to take a step forward out of a past which has really kept us kind of behind everyone else			1
" that even @entity24 's detractors concede that there is much to like and admire about the man reveals the underlying conflict facing voters in the city of nearly 180,000 as they head to the polls on tuesday : do they go with the candidate with a shadowy past but who nevertheless worked tirelessly to bring a once blighted , ne'er do well city out from those very shadows ? or do they go with the less experienced and younger @entity13 , a candidate who @entity9 -- a politician who knows a little something about being young and inexperienced and running for office -- says will " will bring honest leadership to @entity0 ? " " a lot of positive things happened while ( @entity47 ) was in office but a lot of negative things happened , " said resident @entity178			1
" i mean , he 's a celebrity , he has a certain cache , but there are other candidates that are more connected to what 's going on in the city today and that are going to be more able to lead the city into the future and i do n't think that 'd be @entity24			2
" as for any other celebrity -- presidential or otherwise -- campaigning against a @entity47 , @entity24 says his opponent can have them			2
" you know what they all have in common ? none of them live in the city of @entity0			0

@entity24 is running for mayor of @entity0 for the third time
@entity24 resigned the post twice before over felony convictions
@entity24 to @entity2 : " i 've made mistakes in my life obviously , i 've paid the price . "
