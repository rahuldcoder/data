just not when it comes to his hotel towels			1
@entity0 composts when he 's at home in @entity5 , @entity6			0
he eats local , organic and fair - trade food and drives a @entity9 hybrid sports car			0
you might call him green			2
except he 's not so green when he travels for his work at an education nonprofit and stays in a hotel , which happens about 10 weeks per year			1
there , he uses a new towel every day			0
and do n't try to bribe him with a drink or dessert coupon to get him to reuse the same one			2
" i could care less about rewards for environmentally conscious behavior unless it 's miles , " @entity0 wrote in an e-mail			0
if hotels ca n't convince a hybrid - driving recycling enthusiast like @entity0 to go green while traveling , how can they possibly convince everyone else ? 9 glamorous movie - star hotels that 's the problem of hotels trying to " green " your hotel stay			1
after guests have paid a pretty penny for a night at the inn , even the most environmental guests may want to treat themselves to fresh towels every day and those little bottles of sweet - smelling shampoo			1
despite the fact that most people describe themselves in surveys as environmentally conscious and as preferring green products , there 's a big gap between consumer attitudes and consumer behaviors when it comes to going green , said @entity48 , a marketing professor at the @entity49			2
" it can be nice to have fresh towels , and not doing so is a sacrifice , " said @entity48 , whose current research focuses on the impact of hotel sustainability programs on guest satisfaction			1
" @entity57 requires some effort , and there 's some cost to be incurred on the part of the consumer			0
" guests who go green are happy nearly 90 % of hotel guests are offered the chance to do something sustainable during their stays , and about two - thirds will participate , according to @entity48 's analysis of 2011 data from the @entity72			1
those guests who participate in a hotel 's green programs report that they are more satisfied with their stays than guests who do not participate			1
participating in a hotel 's sustainability program provides " a feeling that it was good to be green , it made them feel good about themselves , and that translated to the service provider , " @entity48 said			1
8 getaways we wish we could afford " these guests , who are ostensibly receiving a lower level of service , report being more satisfied overall with their stay			1
" there 's just one catch : guests who do n't participate in voluntary sustainability programs reported the lowest levels of satisfaction with their hotel stays			1
" one explanation for these findings is that when people do n't live up to their ideals , and vice versa , this affects how satisfied they are with the entity that presented them this ' moral dilemma , ' " @entity48 said			2
sustainability is becoming the norm it makes business sense for hotels to go green : increasing sewage rates , stricter water use requirements and more recycling options are all convincing hotels to reduce their water and energy costs , said hotel industry veteran @entity116 , an environmental consultant and " green guru " for the @entity117			1
more than 75 % of @entity120 hotels have linen and towel reuse programs , 59 % have guest or internal recycling programs , and 46 % have a water - saving program , according to a 2012 @entity117 survey of its members			1
they also have " back of the house " programs that include low - flow shower heads , faucets and toilets ; energy - efficient light bulbs , high - efficiency appliances and other efforts			2
some are required by local governments ; others just make business sense			0
that translates into real dollars : the @entity120 @entity142 has found that hotels and other lodging facilities use more than 510 trillion btu of energy annually at a cost of more than $ 7.4 billion			1
that energy use generates 54 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions , equal to the emissions from more than 11 million passenger vehicles , according to the agency			2
beyond @entity153 : best cruises for 2013 the @entity142 reports that the lodging industry could save $ 745 million annually by reducing energy use by 10 %			2
that translates to 60 cents more revenue per room night at limited - service hotels and $ 2 at full - service hotels			1
annoyed that the hotel 's bottom line benefits from your sacrifice ? some hotels are trying to make water - saving behavior pay for their guests			1
participating @entity169 gives guests a $ 5 food and drink voucher or 500 @entity173 points for every day they decline housekeeping 's services ( except departure day )			2
part of the @entity179 culture some hotels are making green cool			1
it seems to be an easier sell for hip , higher - end chains like @entity187 's properties , which cultivate an edgier base of customers			0
about 85 % of hotel guests participate in the chain 's towel and sheet reuse program , said @entity194 , @entity179 's executive vice president of hotel operations			1
@entity195 started the boutique hotel chain by rehabbing older buildings and turning them into hotels			1
although @entity195 died in 2001 , the company that bears his name still has the reputation he cultivated			0
most locations welcome guests to mingle at a lobby cocktail hour , lounge in their animal - print robes and bring their pets on their stay			1
and many locations will lend guests a goldfish as part of the @entity214 program			2
" i think our guests expect us to push the envelope and try things that are different than what the mass - appeal hotels are doing , " @entity194 said			1
@entity194 's convinced that some guests do n't actually mean to ask for new towels but are much like his teenage daughter , who tosses her towels on the floor at home for no good reason			1
" once it 's on the floor , you 're going to get a clean towel , " he said			0
( hotel guests , not his daughter			1
) the pressure on a mid-priced chain it 's trickier for other hotel chains , where sustainability is n't necessarily part of the appeal to the customer			1
the mid-priced chains are competing for a more price - sensitive business and leisure traveler			0
@entity245 , which offers a hot breakfast at its nearly 1,900 company - owned and franchise locations across the country , has two environmentally friendly options for disposable plates , bowls and cutlery : 100 % biodegradable @entity254 or @entity255 , a resin material made from potato starch			0
the chain 's takeout coffee cup sleeves are made from 100 % recycled fiber , and the towel reuse program simply asks customers using a door hanger to " reuse or replace " towels			2
no big deal either way , the sign suggests			0
" we 're delivering these messages in a light - hearted way			0
... it 's not preachy or paternalistic , " said @entity272 , vice president of corporate responsibility for @entity274 , which owns @entity275			0
more happens behind the scenes at @entity275 , which benefits from @entity277 , @entity274 's company - wide sustainability system that tracks the sustainability of 200 operational practices at nearly 3,900 properties around the world			0
@entity274 has saved more than $ 147 million since 2008 through efficiency projects , including reporting through @entity277 , @entity272 said			0
satisfying the luxury guest you 'd think environmental sustainability programs would hit a roadblock with luxury guests , who want the best of everything			2
not so , said @entity292 , vice president of @entity294 's @entity293 , the chain 's social and environmental responsibility program			0
" it in no way diminishes the luxury experience , " @entity298 said			0
" we still have the best towels , linens and amenities			2
" many @entity294 guests now use the same sheets two nights in a row ( introduced in 2011 ) and hang up their towels to use another day ( introduced in 2009 )			1
" we 've not had a single negative guest comment but have certainly had positive guest comments , " @entity298 said			0
" guests want to see we 're doing the right thing			2
" it helps that the onus is really on the business to be responsible in its construction , hotel operations , food service and landscaping , she said			2
" the majority of what can be done for the environment is what we can do as a business , " @entity298 said			0
no matter the price point , no hotelier can afford to lose a guest because he or she does n't like the way a hotel communicates its message			1
even @entity195 's @entity194 said the boutique chain wo n't roll out an environmental initiative if tests show that customers do n't like it			0
but in @entity195 's case , @entity194 found that guests approve of their efforts			0
" our guest satisfaction has improved since our green initiatives were introduced , and it 's given us confidence that efforts have not deteriorated the guest experience , " he said			0
the tide may be turning it 's possible that younger people used to recycling and saving water will bring those attitudes into their hotel stays as they age			1
@entity294 's @entity298 sees children leading their parents into caring about the environment on their hotel stays			0
betting that more and more consumers want to choose environmentally friendly hotels right now , travel website @entity362 is launching its @entity364 program this year to let travelers know which hotels have sustainable practices			1
about 71 % of travelers reported that they planned to choose hotels based on sustainability over the next year , compared with 65 % in the previous survey , according to an april 2012 trip advisor survey			0
yet while 81 % of hotels have some green programs , almost a quarter do n't communicate that fact to their guests , said @entity362 spokeswoman @entity379			1
the website is accepting applications from hotels to qualify for a " @entity383 " or " @entity385 " label on the @entity362 site based on their sustainable practices			1
the program will rely on traveler feedback , and any discrepancies could trigger an independent audit of the hotel			0
that 's information that @entity395 , 33 , who always hangs up her towels at hotels to reuse them the next day , would enjoy having			2
" trying to limit my impact on the environment makes me feel good , " said @entity398 , assistant director of residence life at @entity400 in @entity401			0
" when i go against my green principles for the sake of convenience or to go with the flow , i feel bad about myself and guilty			0
i ca n't imagine how those feelings would enhance my vacation , which is supposed to be all about feeling good			0
" do you like to participate in a hotel 's sustainable programs , or do they irritate you ? please share your thoughts in the comments section below .			0

hotel guests who " go green " are happier with their stay
increasing water and energy costs are pushing hotels to cut costs wherever they can
many hotels find that guests do n't mind using the same towels and sheets every night
@entity362 will be adding a green label for hotels listed on its site
