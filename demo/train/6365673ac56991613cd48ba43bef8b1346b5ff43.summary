president @entity0 and @entity1 are once again at odds over national security : this time , it 's over the @entity6 cyberattack on @entity7			1
sen. @entity1 rejected @entity0 's characterization of the @entity6 hack as " an act of cybervandelism , " instead calling it " a new form of warfare " on @entity16 's @entity15			1
" the president does not understand that this is a manifestation of a new form of warfare when you destroy economies , when you are able to impose censorship , " @entity1 , a @entity17 from @entity18 , said			2
" it 's more than vandalism			0
it 's a new form of warfare that we 're involved in and we need to react and we need to react vigorously			2
" a group of @entity6 - backed hackers broke into @entity7 ' servers last month and threatened to attack movie theaters screening the movie , " @entity35 , " a satirical comedy depicting an assassination attempt against @entity6 leader @entity38			0
@entity7 put off its plans to release the film after major movie theaters decided not to screen it			0
@entity1 called that attack an " act of war " in a radio interview on friday and pledged to call a hearing on the matter in the first two weeks of the next @entity46 when he takes the helm of the @entity48 @entity1 also ( literally ) laughed off the notion that @entity0 's actions are responsible for crippling the @entity53 economy , which is nose diving into a recession			1
" we should be thanking the @entity57 who have allowed the value of a barrel of oil to go to the point where it 's affecting dramatically @entity55 's economy , " @entity55 said			0
" it has nothing to do with any action taken by the @entity68			0
" @entity1 added that he believes @entity70 sanctions , which have been the lynchpin of @entity0 's strategy in confronting @entity53 , have had little effect			1
in his interview with @entity16 's @entity75 that aired sunday , @entity0 countered critics like @entity1 who have said @entity0 has been outmaneuvered by @entity55 and pointed to the @entity53 economic collapse as evidence			1
" right now he 's presiding over the collapse of his currency , a major financial crisis and a huge economic contraction , " @entity0 said			2
" that does n't sound like somebody who has rolled me or the @entity70			0
" @entity1 also joined the fray of @entity17 -- including most prominently potential 2016 presidential candidate sen. @entity87 -- who have criticized @entity0 's decision to ease sanctions and normalize relations with @entity91 , claiming that @entity0 is rewarding @entity91 for bad behavior			1
" that in my view would encourage others , " he said			0
most @entity96 and a few @entity17 , including sens. @entity97 and @entity98 , have hailed @entity0 's agreement with @entity91 since the 50 - year embargo against the country has failed to alter the country 's internal politics .			2

@entity1 dismissed @entity0 's characterization of the @entity7 cyberattack as " cybervandalism "
instead , @entity1 called it " a new form of warfare " and has called it an " act of warfare "
@entity1 also said the @entity57 are more responsible for the @entity53 economic collapse than @entity0 's *policies*
