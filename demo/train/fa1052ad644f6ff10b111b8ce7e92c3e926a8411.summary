a year later , there 's not one power pole , wall - mounted gas meter or roadside curb that has n't been meticulously attended to			1

where industrious fishing towns once stood are empty streetscapes that resemble vast car parks			0

map : impact of the earthquake for the newly created @entity79 -- which the government has dubbed the " command tower " for recovery -- the scale of the clean - up is still daunting one year later			1
" the most serious problem is how to handle the enormous amount of debris , " @entity85 , the parliamentary secretary for reconstruction , told the @entity87			2
