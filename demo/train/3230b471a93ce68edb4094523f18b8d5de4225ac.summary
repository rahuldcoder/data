@entity0 -- president @entity2 is showing his softer side			1
the man who was known in his first term for his cool , detached style has been crying , repeatedly			1
it started the day after his re-election when a teary and happy president told campaign volunteers , " i 'm so proud of you guys			2
" a month later he was overcome by grief as he wept openly in the @entity15 briefing room after the @entity17 , @entity18 , shootings			0
there were tears again during a heroes ceremony for @entity17 victims , and while delivering remarks about rev. @entity24 the evolution of the nation 's ' first gay president ' second - term @entity2 is not just showing his emotions , he 's sharing them , too -- laughing with the @entity29 at the @entity15 and telling people in a @entity32 audience that they 're in the area where " @entity36 and i fell in love			1
" the president 's biographer attributes the shift to a new sense of freedom from winning a second term			1
" i think we 've all seen , actually since the day after his re-election a more relaxed @entity2 , really something that took a lifetime for him to get to this point , " @entity45 said			1
" we 've really seen a new @entity2			1
" the " new " @entity2 is venturing into territory the first term @entity2 shied away from			1
@entity2 urges court to overturn @entity56 same - sex marriage ban he talked about his complicated biracial identity in this eulogy for sen. @entity59 of @entity60			1
" here i was , a young boy with a white mom , a black father , raised in @entity65 and @entity60 , " the president said at the @entity62 in @entity0			2
" and i was beginning to sense how fitting into the world might not be as simple as it might seem			2
" to kids at home in @entity32 , he admitted he was often in trouble when he was a teenager			0
" when i screwed up , the consequences were n't as high as when kids on the @entity74 screw up , " he told them			0
" so i had more of a safety net but these guys are no different than me			0
" and , he used unusually personal language to describe @entity24 's struggles			2
" we often think of him standing tall in front of these endless crowds , stirring the nation 's conscience with a bellowing voice and a mighty dream			2
but i also thought of his doubts ... the lonely moments when he was left to confront the presence of long - festering injustice and undisguised hate , " @entity2 told a crowd at the @entity87 in february			1
" ( @entity96 ) imagined the darkness and the doubt that must have surrounded him when he was in that @entity100 jail , and the anger that surely rose up in him the night his house was bombed			2
" the president and the nation have evolved on same - sex marriage @entity2 's biographer says a more complete personality is coming into focus			1
" i do n't think one ever knows the real him			0
but i think that it 's closer to being the private and the public @entity2 coming together in a clearer way , " @entity45 said			1
this warmer more revealing @entity2 was on display during the 2008 campaign			1
then he used his biography to sell himself as the melting pot embodied			0
his most vocal critics turned parts of his resume into punch lines , perhaps most memorably by former @entity123 gov. @entity122 at the @entity124			0
" i guess a small - town mayor is sort of like a community organizer , except you have actual responsibilities , " @entity122 said			2
perhaps in reaction , once in office the president became more cautious about talking about his past			2
on most topics , he just did n't go there			0
@entity2 : spending cuts would be bad for business but now , free of the pressure to woo swing voters , he 's back to using his story and his rhetorical skills to try to inspire audiences and pitch policies			1
@entity2 himself said tuesday night in @entity144 : " i 've run my last election			1
" he told @entity147 ' @entity146 last summer that the biggest mistake of his first term was not communicating his vision with the @entity152 people			2
" when i think about what we 've done well and what we have n't done well , the mistake of my first term -- couple of years -- was thinking that this job was just about getting the policy right , " he said			1
" and that 's important but the nature of this office is also to tell a story to the @entity152 people that gives them a sense of unity and purpose and optimism , especially during tough times			1
" these days he 's hardly touchy - feely , but he 's more likely to wear his heart on his sleeve			1
and use passion for political effect			0
during the fight over forced spending cuts , he 's made a clear effort to put faces on the impending changes			0
at one @entity15 event , he got emotional as he stood in front of a group of first responders			0
" and this is not an abstraction			0
there are people whose livelihoods are at stake			0
there are communities that are going to be impacted in a negative way , " he said			0
" and i know that sometimes all this squabbling in @entity0 seems very abstract , and in the abstract , people like the idea , there must be some spending we can cut , there must be some waste out there			0
but this is n't the right way to do it			0
" rewind back to four years ago in march 2009 , the same president was confronted with a teacher about to lose her job			1
instead of consoling her or expressing her concern , he asked if she got a " pink slip " and launched into his views on education policy			0
these days he 's doing better on the empathy test			0
in a gun control plea at his recent @entity218 address , the chamber rose to its feet as a fervent @entity2 reminded the country of recent tragedies			1
" @entity222 deserves a vote			0
the families of @entity17 deserve a vote , " @entity2 said on the @entity15 floor			1
" the families of @entity228 deserve a vote			0
the families of @entity231 and @entity232 and @entity233 and the countless other communities ripped open by gun violence , they deserve a simple vote			0
" that 's the kind of emotional rallying cry he once saved for campaign style events outside the @entity241			1
even the president admits he has changed , in repeated humble brags			2
" the fascinating thing about this job is the longer you 're in it , the more humble you get and the more you recognize your own imperfections , " he told @entity15 @entity248 at their retreat in @entity144			2
" the one thing about being president is after four years , you get pretty humble , " @entity2 said tuesday			1
" you think maybe you would n't but you become more humble			0
you realize what you do n't know			0
you realize , you know , all the mistakes you make			0
" it 's humility he can afford , after winning a second term			2
" president @entity2 is never going to be the ' i feel your pain ' @entity262 - type of president but he 's getting closer , " @entity45 said .			1
