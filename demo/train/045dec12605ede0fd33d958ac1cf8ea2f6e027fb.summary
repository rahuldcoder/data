why in the world would @entity0 , a former half - term senator from @entity2 's @entity1 , put himself in the mix for the 2016 @entity6 presidential nomination ? the real question is : why not ? when @entity0 told the @entity9 over the weekend that he was heading to the @entity10 " to determine whether there 's an interest in my brand of leadership and @entity15 , " the news was met with some amusement by political insiders			1
after all , @entity0 has already floated bids for @entity20 senator and @entity1 governor , and he does n't seem likely to pursue either			1
2016 watch : @entity0 makes a stop in @entity10 @entity0 was thumped by @entity24 in his 2012 re-election bid , and he became something of a punch line earlier this year after he unleashed a volley of questionable late night tweets at some online critics			1
but so what ? the truth is that in today 's media environment , there 's almost no downside for a long - shot " candidate " like @entity0 to tell people he 's mulling a @entity39 run			1
for someone with no real perch other than a paid gig at @entity44 , it actually makes a lot of sense			0
just by going to the @entity10 , a must - do for any ambitious pol , @entity0 will be rewarded with the only currency that matters in modern campaign politics ( other than hard fundraising dollars ) : buzz			2
" funnel cake and free name @entity51			0
what 's not to love ? " asked @entity53 , a @entity54 - based @entity6 operative and former @entity2 adviser			2
" how many stories got posted about @entity59 's legislative agenda yesterday ? it 's fun			2
senator @entity0 's a skilled retail politician and this gives him a platform to talk about a brand of @entity15 we could use more of			1
" for obsessive political watchers , @entity0 's shamelessness about the whole enterprise is kind of refreshing			1
" i do admire the audacity to just go to the state fair and tweet about it , " said @entity68 , a professor at the @entity69 and regular contributor to the @entity73 @entity72 conversation			0
@entity0 knows exactly what he 's doing			1
@entity0 stirs speculation with @entity20 visit it 's the same reason @entity82 rep. @entity81 and @entity84 rep. @entity83 ( no relation ; not even close ) are " refusing to rule out " a 2016 bid			1
will either of them be taking the oath of office one day ? nope			0
but with so many news platforms to fill -- on television , on the web , on the radio -- a presidential trial balloon or a trip to @entity10 is almost guaranteed to get you at least a crumb of media exposure , a boost in stature , and maybe even a few campaign contributions down the road			0
just look at this month 's @entity103 , a gathering of social conservatives in @entity10 that drew potential 2016 presidential contenders @entity107 and @entity108 to the first - in - the - nation caucus state			2
both men seem likely to run for the @entity6 nomination , and both will be returning to @entity82 over and over and over again in the coming years			0
but even if they do n't , the two conservatives proved how keeping one 's name in the 2016 conversation is its own reward			2
in their speeches , @entity107 and @entity108 issued a series of @entity121 bromides and boosted their profiles with the grassroots activists who attended the @entity82 summit			0
neither @entity6 did a single thing to advance the news cycle other than board an airplane to @entity9			0
yet there they were , trailed at every turn by reporters from the @entity132 , @entity9 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity44			0
another @entity107 trip to @entity10 stokes 2016 speculation " the focus on the 2016 presidential contest is completely ridiculous , and everybody knows it , " wrote @entity141 of @entity142 after witnessing the cattle call			0
in our atomized media ecosystem , there 's certainly a market for niche political coverage , in the same way there 's a market for micro-reporting on the status of @entity158 's return from knee surgery			0
more importantly , the presidential cycle is starting earlier than it ever has , with advisers to likely candidates working behind the scenes to assemble campaign infrastructure and peddle dirt on their potential opponents			2
on the @entity6 side , @entity168 sen. @entity167 and @entity170 gov. @entity169 are driving national discussions about ideology and governance			0
still , there 's a difference between running for president and " running " for president , even though it 's sometimes difficult to tell the difference			1
running for president requires hard work , an ungodly amount of fundraising effort , a professional team of advisers , polling , a paid media strategy , a voter contact operation and ballot access			1
see : @entity2 , @entity191 " running " for president means doing a lot of interviews and delivering some well - timed lines in debates			2
see : @entity197 , @entity198			0
which category does @entity0 fall under ? for the moment , it would seem the latter			2
looking at the 2016 @entity6 field , @entity169 probably has the @entity205 @entity6 lane all to himself , a prospect that would make it difficult for @entity0 to raise money			2
before his @entity10 trip , @entity0 met privately with @entity169 at the @entity212 's summer conference in @entity54 , a meeting first reported by the @entity134			1
@entity169 raised money for @entity0 several times during his @entity217 tenure , and , according to one @entity169 insider , the two are " very friendly			1
" then there 's the fact that @entity0 , who supports some abortion rights , is n't exactly a hardliner on social issues that matter to so many @entity6 caucus - goers in @entity10			1
even some of his former advisers are n't sure what he 's up to			1
@entity229 , the media strategist who crafted @entity0 's truck - driving , regular - guy image during his stunning 2010 @entity217 upset , is not currently advising him , @entity6 sources told @entity233			1
asked by text message if he 's serious about a presidential bid , one @entity6 who talks to @entity0 often responded : " who knows			1
you should call him and ask			0
" " he 's acting on his own , as far as i can tell , " another onetime adviser said in an e-mail			0
but what if @entity0 takes off ? what if he gains a toehold in @entity20 , rises to high single digits in the polls sometime in 2015 , and gets invited to some @entity6 primary debates ? what if he rattles off a few good lines , has his moment in the sun , and then fades ? he will have lost absolutely nothing -- but gained a spot on some vice presidential short lists along with a hike in his post-campaign speaking fees			2
another @entity6 who has spoken with @entity0 recently is n't surprised by the sudden interest in the presidential spotlight			1
@entity0 , this person said , is a relentlessly enthusiastic guy who still takes great pride in capturing @entity261 's old @entity217 seat			1
" the fact that he is in @entity10 does n't surprise me , " the @entity6 told @entity233			0
" in ' 16 , it 's not a bad idea to put your name out there and see where it takes you			0
he was enthusiastic about getting back in the national conversation			0
i could definitely anticipate this			0

there 's a difference between running for president and " running " for president
@entity0 served part of one term in the @entity217 before losing his re-election bid
there 's almost no downside in a politician saying he 's considering a presidential run
even some of his former advisers say they do n't know what @entity0 is up to
