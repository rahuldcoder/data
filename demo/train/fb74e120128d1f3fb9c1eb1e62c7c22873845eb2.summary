deaths continue amid diplomatic deadlock @entity90 railed against " member states " of the @entity16 who are helping the opposition			1
" those who are very interested in halting violence and making the comprehensive national dialogue in @entity6 a success should stop interfering in our internal affairs and should stop arming , hosting , funding and protecting the armed terrorist groups in my country , " he said			2
@entity106 foreign secretary @entity105 , who has expressed outrage about the massacre , was in @entity109 on monday seeking to persuade @entity109 officials to pressure the @entity6 regime to comply with @entity1 's peace plan			1
but after @entity105 met with @entity109 foreign minister @entity114 , there was no clear sign that international action would ratchet up			0
" it sounds very noble to say @entity109 is supporting the @entity6 government , and when it stops supporting the @entity6 government , everything will be fine , " @entity114 told reporters			2
but in reality , he said , " we do not support the @entity6 government			2
we are supporting the @entity1 plan that addresses both the @entity6 government and the armed opposition			1

pro-government gangs have returned to @entity11 , where food , water and medicine are in short supply , he said			2
" they only thing we have here is the @entity179 ( @entity6 ) @entity178			2

" opinion : only @entity109 and @entity224 can stop the carnage and some called @entity6 's promise of an investigation a farce			2
" there 's no way a @entity6 military commission can credibly investigate this horrendous crime when so much evidence suggests pro-government forces were responsible , " said @entity230 , @entity231 and @entity233 director at @entity234			2
" @entity1 should insist that @entity6 grant access to the @entity3 commission of inquiry to investigate this and other grave crimes			1
" over the weekend , the @entity178 said the @entity1 plan was " dead " after the @entity11 massacre			2
" the joint command of the @entity178 inside @entity6 announces that it is no longer possible to abide by the peace plan brokered by @entity1 , ( which ) the regime is taking advantage of in order to commit more massacres against our unarmed civilians , " @entity178 spokesman col. @entity258 said in a video posted saturday			2
" this is a clear evidence that @entity1 's plan is dead and a clear indication that @entity41 and his criminal gang do not understand anything but the language of force and violence , " @entity258 said			0
