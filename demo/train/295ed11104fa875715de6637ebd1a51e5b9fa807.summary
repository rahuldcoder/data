@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity1 @entity4 have declared a cease - fire in @entity6 , one of the seven semi-autonomous tribal areas in northwest @entity1 , three @entity4 commanders told @entity2 tuesday			1
the cease - fire -- agreed a month ago -- follows back - channel peace talks that have been taking place between intermediaries representing the @entity1 government and the @entity1 @entity4 , the commanders said			1
the commanders , speaking under condition of anonymity , said the talks were preliminary and began in late september , focusing only on @entity6			0
the group has demanded an exchange of prisoners , the withdrawal of @entity1 troops from @entity6 and compensation for the victims of army operations in the area , which borders @entity28 , the @entity4 commanders told @entity2			1
the @entity1 @entity4 has made preliminary contacts with the government through local tribal elders to explore the possibilities of a peace deal , the commanders said			1
@entity6 is believed to be the headquarters of the @entity1 @entity4 leadership			1
the outcome of the purported back - channel talks is not yet known -- and senior figures in the country 's government and military have denied they are going on			0
the official spokesman for the @entity1 @entity4 , a group that has not always spoken with one voice , categorically denied the commanders ' claims			1
" we are not against @entity1			0
we are against the @entity48 and its allies , " spokesman @entity47 said			0
" once @entity1 stops acting as an ally of @entity48 , only then will we be open to peace talks with the @entity1 government			2
" @entity1 's interior minister denied the government is actively in talks with any faction of the @entity1 @entity4			1
" the @entity4 have been trying to contact us ; however , we will not engage in peace talks with them until they give up their arms , " interior minister @entity58 told @entity2			0
@entity58 said the message the @entity1 government has sent to the @entity4 is : " give up your arms and then we will talk			1
" the @entity1 military dismissed the reports of ongoing peace talks as " concocted and baseless			2
" commander @entity70 , a military spokesman , told reporters in @entity72 , in @entity1 's northwestern @entity74 district : " we are not talking to the @entity4			2
this is the government 's job , not ours			0
" both the @entity4 and the @entity1 government would consider any talks highly sensitive because of the risk of being perceived as abandoning their cause and appeasing the enemy			1
both sides have set conditions for talks and neither wants to be seen as the side that abandons its conditions			0
this may explain why the two sides are denying talks are taking place and apparently using go - betweens instead of meeting directly			2
the @entity1 government faces the added risk of upsetting the @entity48 , since @entity93 has long pressed @entity1 to get more aggressive with violent extremists along the @entity1 - @entity28 border			2
the @entity48 expressed serious concern after @entity1 's short - lived peace deal with the @entity1 @entity4 in 2008			1
founded by @entity98 in 2007 , the @entity1 @entity4 is a banned @entity99 group said to have links with the @entity28 @entity4 and @entity101			0
