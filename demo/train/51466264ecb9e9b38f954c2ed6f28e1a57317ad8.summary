-- it 's not news that looks matter			0
depending on how attractive people think we are , we may have at times found ourselves dateless or overwhelmed with unwanted attention			1
studies have indeed shown that people attribute more intelligence and competence to taller , well - turned - out or otherwise good - looking people			1
however , a new briefing paper by the @entity14 tell us life 's uneven distribution of beauty counts in an even more poignant place than we may have considered : in school evaluations of our children by teachers and peers			1
in a recently releasted briefing report , " in school , @entity23 and @entity25 ( but they mostly help )			2
" sociologists @entity27 and @entity29 show that in high school , some students -- say , a prom queen and king -- will be rated higher in intelligence , personality and potential for success just because they are considered good - looking			1
more than that , they will actually get higher grades and be more likely to graduate from college			0
in fact , the authors , whose the larger study -- published in book form by @entity45 -- say that " the difference in @entity49 and college graduation rates between youth rated by others as attractive , versus average in looks , is similar to the differences in academic achievement between youth raised in two - parent versus single - parent families			1
" if the idea that kids get better grades based on " getting by on looks " frosts you , wait			2
this will make you nuts : based on their findings , @entity68 and @entity29 believe that the effects of beauty ( or lack thereof ) may last far beyond high school graduation			1
they say there is a cumulative boost ( or loss ) of self - esteem about one 's own appearance that carries over from high school into college and perhaps over a lifetime			1
and even though the authors say that beauty has its pitfalls ( good - looking men and women , for example , dated more and drank more and some of this had a negative impact on their grades and college success ) , their conclusion is that , overall , this period of " lookism " in high school is important enough to merit the same kind of consciousness - raising discussion given to unfair racial or class stereotypes			1
if looks translate into higher praise , better grades and even more credit for being warm and sensitive , as the authors found in their research , this is a real boon for the people with the lucky dna			1
each advantage a student has is likely to make that young man or woman feel more self - confident -- and self - confidence is an extraordinary tool to use in adult life			2
the other side of the coin is what 's concerning : there is , as many parents know , the depression and sense of worthlessness a young adult may feel when he or she is not deemed good - looking in high school			1
it is frightening to think this may lead to a lifetime of feeling awkward , unlovable and inferior			0
we have all become more sensitive and activist about issues of adolescence we used to ignore			0
we now know how dangerous bullying is , how destructive depression can be and how important it is to reframe our view of people who have physical or mental disabilities			1
while we ca n't mandate that people change their opinion about who is or is not good - looking , we could ask our kids ' teachers to be aware of their own tendency to give a higher grade or greater approval to a good - looking kid than to one that is not			1
we could all bring attention to slang that kids use to assess or denigrate another person 's looks			0
does this sound too pc ? maybe			0
but a little sensitivity here would n't be a bad thing			0
terms such as " tubby " or " skinny " or " lame " or other insult equivalents you may have heard do n't need to be leveled at anyone			0
young people are acutely aware when they are not the favored ones , and they know that popularity and good looks are usually paired			2
moreover , an ambitious student who is attractive might prefer to be complimented on what he or she said or did rather than for appearance			0
it does them no favor to allow them to think that their looks are their primary and best attribute ; it could cause them to be insecure about other aspects of their personality or behavior			0
talking openly about this could make it clearer to the people in our children 's day - to - day world that their casual remarks can have long - term effects			2
it can also take some of the sting out of not being in the running for prom king or queen			0
and here i would suggest that such beauty and popularity contests are a dicey idea for schools in the first place			0
they have an impact on the impressions and behavior of everyone in the school , even , potentially , teachers			2
we spend time and energy to make sure our kids are treated fairly in life			0
let 's help ensure they are not discriminated against -- or given a free ride -- just because of the way they look			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity226 .			1

@entity226 : study finds edge given attractive people can start in school with teachers
*language* , *attitudes* expressed by peers , adults shape kids ' self - worth for lifetime , she says
we *'re* sensitive to race , class , disabilities ; how about effect of beauty *standards* , she asks ?
@entity226 : teachers , be aware of your power in contributing to beauty discrimination
