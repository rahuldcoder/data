@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 has spent 15 years matching people with service dogs that can help them with their special needs and disabilities			1
with the help of her staff , she puts a lot of thought into the process to make sure each person has the right dog for them			2
but one recent story -- involving an @entity20 war veteran and a @entity22 shepherd named @entity23 -- has her convinced that larger forces are sometimes at work			1
it began in march , when @entity3 got an e-mail from @entity29 sgt. @entity28			1
@entity30 had lost both his legs in an ied explosion , and he was desperate for a service dog while he recovered at @entity34 in @entity35			1
@entity3 knew @entity23 , a dog they were training at the time , would be perfect for him			1
" i sent him a picture of @entity23 and said , ' how would you like this dog ? ' " @entity3 said			1
" he was so excited			0
... he would text me every day			0
" she understood that @entity30 was eager for the companionship of a service dog and the independence that it could provide			1
" soldiers , they 're not wanting people to do things for them , " said @entity3 , who was honored as a @entity46 for her work with autistic and special - needs children			1
" if you have to ask ( someone ) all the time to pick things up that you drop or ' bring me my wheelchair , ' they have to depend on somebody else			0
... giving them a service dog is giving them back a means of doing it themselves			1
" @entity3 and @entity30 grew to be friends , and she was struck by his generosity			1
although @entity3 was going to give him his dog for free , she asks civilians to contribute to help offset their dog 's training costs			1
so @entity30 had started planning ways to help raise money			0
then , one day , @entity3 did n't hear from him			1
" i went to his @entity76 page , and this first post that i saw said , ' you were the most wonderful young man , ' " she said			0
" and i 'm like , " were ? ' " @entity3 was devastated to learn that @entity30 had passed away from complications related to his injuries the previous night			1
but she soon decided that the best way she could honor him was to place @entity23 with another disabled soldier			2
she reached out to someone she knew in the military and asked for help			0
" i said , ' find me another @entity28 ! ' " she recalled			2
within days , @entity90 heard about the dog at the @entity92 , a @entity93 - based charity that helps injured service members recover			2
" someone basically made her aware that this group was looking for a soldier amputee to connect with a service dog , " said @entity90 's husband , @entity29 capt. @entity95			1
" i was looking for a dog myself , so @entity90 kind of jumped on it			0
" @entity90 , like @entity30 , had lost both his legs in @entity20			0
but @entity3 soon discovered that they had much more in common			2
she found out they had served in the same unit and been injured on the same day			0
in fact , @entity30 had actually helped with @entity90 's medical evacuation , just hours before suffering his own injuries			0
both had also recovered at @entity34 and become friendly during therapy together			0
@entity3 was floored by the coincidence , as she had gotten in touch with both men through completely separate channels			2
" it 's like a once - in - a - lifetime story that you hear , " she said			0
" i just think it was meant to be			0
" @entity90 recognizes that it 's an unusual coincidence , but he does n't think of it in quite the same way			0
" if it was fate , then @entity28 was meant to die , so i do n't really like to think of that , " he said			2
" but if @entity28 ca n't be here , it 's almost fitting that i get @entity23 as my service dog			1
" there 's a connection between him and myself			0
... @entity28 will always be in my thoughts			2
" @entity3 said the episode has renewed her desire to work with veterans			1
" @entity28 and @entity95 lost their independence , giving independence to others			1
... those veterans , that was who i wanted to help , " she said			0
" i 'm hoping more of these wounded soldiers will come to us looking for dogs			0
they can all come , and we will help them			0
" do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2013 @entity46			2

@entity3 , a 2008 @entity46 , finds service dogs for people in need
she had a dog ready for disabled war veteran @entity28 , but he died in march
the dog ended up with another veteran , @entity95
*unbeknownst* to @entity3 , the two veterans knew each other and served together
