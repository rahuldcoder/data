@entity0 -- a letter from about 30 prominent rabbis ' wives was causing a stir in @entity6 wednesday because it urges @entity6 girls not to date @entity8			1
the open letter comes three weeks after the uproar caused by another letter , which was written by 50 state - appointed rabbis and told @entity13 not to rent or sell property to non-jews			1
the latest missive , which was published by some websites and news outlets , says @entity8 men act polite around @entity13 girls and " act as if they really care about you , " but it says that 's a ruse			1
the men , it says , even change their @entity8 names to hebrew forms like @entity27 and @entity28 in order to get close to the girls			1
" this behavior is temporary , " the letter says			2
" as soon as you are in their hands , in their villages under their control , everything becomes different			0
you can ask dozens of girls who have been there			2
they will tell you it is all an act			0
" as soon as you arrive at the village , your life will never be the same			0
the attention will be replaced with curses , beatings , and humiliations			0
even if you want to leave the village it will be much harder			0
they wo n't let you , they will chase you , they wo n't let you come back			0
" it urges @entity13 girls not to go out with non-jews or work in places that employ non-jews			1
" your grandmothers never dreamt that their descendants would do something that will take the next generations of her family out of the @entity13 people , " it says			1
the letter was initiated by the head of @entity70 , an extreme right - wing group that says it aims to prevent the " assimilation of the @entity13 people " and works at " saving @entity13 girls from @entity8 villages			1
" " it 's known that girls who go out with @entity8 are beaten , these girls are in danger			1
... there is a violent social trend and everyone ignores it , " said the head of the group , @entity79 , in a radio interview wednesday morning			0
the head of @entity6 's @entity87 , rabbi @entity86 , harshly condemned the letter and said , " @entity6 society is falling into a deep , dark pit of racism and xenophobia , " according to spokeswoman @entity93			2
more than 30 female rabbis from the @entity87 published a counter-letter harshly condemning the one released wednesday , @entity93 said			2
@entity86 also called on prime minister @entity97 and justice minister @entity98 to speak out against it			0
among the rabbis ' wives who signed the letter is @entity103 , the daughter - in - law of rabbi @entity104 , the spiritual leader of the ultra-orthodox @entity106 political party			1
@entity108 , the wife of extreme right - wing rabbi @entity109 , was another signatory			0
rabbi @entity104 was one of the authors of the letter written earlier this month that urged @entity13 not to sell or rent property to non-jews			1
it prompted widespread condemnation from politicians , human rights groups and leading rabbis in both @entity6 and the @entity122			2
the letter , which was distributed to synagogues and published in some religious newspapers , had warned that those who defied the religious ruling should be ostracized			0
it said if one apartment is taken by a non-jew , it devalues all the neighbors ' apartments			0
more than 800 rabbis from around the world signed a petition against the letter , saying " statements like these do great damage to our efforts to encourage people to love and support @entity6			1
" the petition said " the attempt to root discriminatory policies based on religion or ethnicity in @entity147 is a painful distortion of our tradition			0
@entity151 ( the @entity13 people ) knows the sting of discrimination , and we still bear the scars of hatred			2
when those who represent the official rabbinic leadership of the state of @entity6 express such positions , we are distressed by this ... desecration of @entity164 's name			0
" nearly 1.5 million @entity8 residents live inside @entity6 , making up 23 % of the population			2
a poll published tuesday by the @entity168 in @entity0 showed that 48 % of @entity6 oppose the call to avoid renting or selling property to @entity8 .			1

the letter is written by prominent rabbis ' wives
it says girls should not date or work with @entity8 men
it follows another letter urging @entity13 not to sell or rent property to @entity8
