-- @entity1 just returned to " @entity2 " in 2013 , but she 's already exiting the series once again			1
back in june , @entity4 confirmed that @entity1 , a longtime celebrity trainer with the reality weight loss competition , would not be returning in the fall for season 16			2
@entity9 ' participation with the series has been an on - and - off relationship , as she 's left and rejoined the program twice since it started in 2004			2
while prior departures either went unexplained or had to do with her family , the 40 - year - old mom of two gave a different reason this time around			0
' @entity2 ' winner : too thin ? " i do n't want fans to think i feel like i 'm too big for the show or that i 'm seeking greener pastures			1
i 'm so grateful to the show and so sad to leave , " she told @entity22			0
" ( @entity24 ) here were some fundamental differences ( with the show 's producers ) that have existed for a while			1
" many have wondered whether @entity1 is leaving because of the controversy with the most recent " @entity2 " winner , 24 - year - old @entity30 , whose 155 - pound weight loss left @entity1 and her celebrity trainer co-star , @entity32 , visibly shocked during the final reveal			1
but @entity1 points to another issue she had : the way the show chose to portray her character			1
" in the beginning of the show , it was tough love			0
you saw the tough , and you saw the love , " she told @entity22			0
but lately , from her perspective , viewers saw " none of the relationships , ( and ) none of the bonds that i build with my clients			0
" the impact of her tv persona was starting to affect her family , and @entity1 felt at the end of @entity30 's season , she needed to " take a hard look at my work , " she told the magazine			1
" i came to the conclusion that moving forward , i need to be able to have an impact on the outcome of what i do			0
" so when " @entity2 " returns on september 11 , it 'll be down one tough - loving trainer but will have added two new faces : @entity4 has announced that @entity65 and @entity66 will be the fitness buffs joining @entity32 and another returning trainer , @entity2 .			2

@entity1 has left " @entity2 " again
she says she wanted more control over her image
she felt there had been changes in the way the show 's produced
her tv persona was starting to *adversely* affect her family
