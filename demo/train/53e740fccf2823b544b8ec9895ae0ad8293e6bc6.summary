-- new @entity2 coach @entity1 has chosen not to select any of the 23 - man @entity4 squad , that refused to take part in a training session during their disastrous tournament , for next month 's friendly international against @entity11			1
@entity1 , who took over from @entity12 following @entity2 's exit at the group stage of the competition , opted to exclude the whole squad for one match as a punishment for their role in the protest that came just two days before their final match against host nation @entity24			1
the @entity25 confirmed the decision on their official website , with a statement saying : " @entity1 proposed to the federal council not to retain any of the 23 players officially selected for the @entity4 in @entity24 , for the friendly match against @entity11 in @entity32 on wednesday august 11			1
" @entity1 will release the list of players selected for this match on thursday august 5			2
" @entity2 's tournament fell into disarray after @entity39 striker @entity38 was sent home following a row with @entity12			1
captain @entity42 then became involved in a heated public argument with coach @entity44 -- resulting in @entity44 storming off the training ground with the squad retreating to their team bus and refusing to train			1
among the players now not available to @entity1 are @entity50 trio @entity49 , @entity51 and @entity52 , @entity54 winger @entity53 , @entity56 's @entity55 , @entity39 's @entity38 and @entity57 and playmaker @entity58 -- who @entity1 coached when he the pair were at @entity60			1
however , there is no suggestion that the ban will last longer than a single match and many of the players are expected to return for the opening @entity67 qualifier at home to @entity70 -- although it remains to be seen whether @entity38 and @entity42 , who were perceived as the ringleaders , will return to the squad			2
goalkeeper @entity73 earlier admitted to @entity75 newspaper that the players had made a mistake in refusing to train			0
" we acted as a team			0
to strike was the decision of a squad who felt lonely , who believed that no - one had stood up for them and who had a message to convey			2

but there were so many problems			0
" @entity73 ' @entity94 teammate @entity93 told the journal du dimanche : " i 'm not proud of what i did but i accept responsibility			0
