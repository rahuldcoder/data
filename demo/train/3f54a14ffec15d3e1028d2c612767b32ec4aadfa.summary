one country , two languages -- and one dream of winning the @entity3			1
if @entity6 is divided by the @entity8 speakers who live in the north and the @entity11 - speaking @entity10 in the south , the nation 's footballers are united with one goal			1
and with its place at the @entity18 finals almost secure , midfielder @entity14 believes @entity6 's multicultural array of stars can follow in the footsteps of @entity23 's 1998 winning team			1
like @entity23 -- a team which included players of @entity26 and @entity27 heritage -- @entity6 's class of 2013 has a cosmopolitan feel			1
striker @entity30 was born in @entity31 , @entity32 , while the likes of @entity35 captain @entity34 and @entity37 striker @entity36 are both of @entity32 heritage			2
then there is @entity41 's @entity40 , who along with @entity43 's @entity42 and 17 - year - old starlet @entity44 is of @entity46 descent			0
@entity14 himself was born in @entity6 after his father moved from @entity49 -- of which he remains proud			1
and while the 26 - year - old considers himself @entity52 , he believes the ethnic mix within the team has made his time in the national setup a more enjoyable experience			2
" we get on very well , i think , " @entity14 told @entity58 ahead of friday 's trip to @entity60 , where a draw will be enough to clinch @entity6 's 2014 place as winner of @entity64 with a match to spare			1
" it makes us strong			0
we have all kinds of players and perhaps you can compare us to the @entity23 side which won the @entity3 in 1998			1
" i think it 's fair to say we 're like them			0
perhaps you could say we 're also like @entity75 in a way			0
" with @entity75 , you can see there 's a real mix of nationalities in their team			0
i like that approach because i 'm of mixed nationality myself			0
" it 's a nuanced response from @entity14 and contrasts sharply with the view of @entity86 midfielder @entity85 , who said this week only @entity88 people should play for @entity89			1
while the @entity6 players remain united , the team will often arrange separate interviews for @entity8 and @entity11 speakers			1
@entity86 defender @entity94 will speak to the press in @entity8 , while @entity97 midfielder @entity96 , whose father came from the @entity27 island of @entity100 , will give his thoughts in @entity11			0
one team but the divisions stop there -- on the pitch these players have come together to give @entity52 football its most exciting generation of players since the team reached the 1986 @entity3 semifinal			1
the path to today 's array of riches has not been an easy one -- @entity6 has failed to qualify for the past five major tournaments and only an extensive overhaul of its playing structure has ensured that the country has not been left behind			1
" some 13 years ago the @entity121 decided to reorganize @entity52 football programs and set up in every province an elite academy , " leading @entity6 youth football coach @entity125 , who has long been interested in maximizing the way players use their brain in games as part of his innovative training sessions , told @entity58 in a recent interview			1
" in collaboration with all the universities in our country and after studying the strategies of other countries the @entity52 fa composed a plan with the new vision implemented in the different federation academies and then step - by - step integrated in the club programs			0
" just as importantly the @entity145 agreed to create a school curriculum to extend the number of weekly training hours			0
" that meant we could guarantee young talents would have about 20 hours training time a week and their school programs were never in danger			0
" the structure , organization and lifestyle in the academies was regularly checked to make sure that this project delivered professional players or highly qualified young people			0
" youth program the project has been a huge success -- @entity6 's top club side @entity165 competes in the @entity166 with a team boasting an average of just 22.5 years			1
the club 's youth teams have been dominating on both the national and @entity172 stage , while the @entity52 under - 21 side recently defeated @entity174 3 - 1			1
" @entity165 have won five of the eight national youth championships and many important @entity172 tournaments such as the @entity178 , the @entity179 and the @entity180 , " added @entity125			2
" the integration of many very young players in the first team is the proof of the success of what has happened in @entity6			1
most of all @entity187 , the 16 - year - old player who has surprised the whole of @entity6 and is the product of the new strategy			1
" star pupils one of those players to have come through the @entity165 system announced himself on the world stage last weekend			0
@entity197 scored twice on his full @entity180 debut for @entity41 in a 2 - 1 win at @entity200 -- sparking a wild frenzy among a whole host of nations which want to secure his international future			2
the 18 - year - old , who was born in @entity6 , could potentially play for his country of birth as well as @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 or @entity212 , which has yet to be recognized by @entity213			2
even @entity89 has made overtures in attracting the youngster to wearing the @entity89			0
there may be a chance @entity197 will wear the red of @entity6 , but that is for the future -- he has refused all international call - ups so far			2
now @entity6 is hoping that the culmination of the project will take place in @entity225 next july with its group of players one of the most talented in @entity229			1
goalkeeper @entity230 has starred in @entity232 's @entity231 for @entity233 , while @entity37 's @entity234 is regarded as one of the most exciting playmakers in the world			0
@entity30 and @entity36 are two of the most lethal finishers in the @entity239 , while @entity40 commanded a $ 43 million transfer fee when he joined @entity41 from @entity241 in august			0
then there is the prodigiously talented @entity243 -- who , at 17 years and 196 days old , became the youngest player to score a hat - trick in the @entity248 league , for @entity249 in august			0
' something special ' there is talent everywhere you look -- it is a squad which promises to thrill , excite , inspire and perhaps , just perhaps , win			2
" for the past three years we 've known that we 've had some good players but we did n't always get the results , " @entity14 says			2
" i think now you can see we have a lot more confidence there			0
with the @entity3 , it 's all looking good for us but it 's not done quite yet			2
" i think there are some difficult games to play but we 're confident			0
" we have a very good team , so we do n't have to be scared			0
but we have to be concentrated , and i believe if we get to @entity225 we can do something special , but we have to get there first			1

@entity6 is considered one of the dark *horses* to win the @entity3 in @entity225
nation has one of the most gifted squads in football thanks to *outstanding* youth program
can qualify for the 2014 tournament on friday night with draw in @entity60
@entity14 believes his side can do ' something special ' next july
