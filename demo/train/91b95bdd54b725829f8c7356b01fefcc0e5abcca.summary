@entity0 -- the @entity2 -- scheduled for sunday -- was canceled friday amid burgeoning criticism as the area recovers from the devastation wrought by @entity6 , city and race officials said			1
mayor @entity10 had said earlier in the week the race would go on -- despite transportation , power and other issues -- contending , among other things , that businesses could use the economic boost the event provides			1
but on friday , he and the race 's organizer issued a joint statement saying they 'd decided to cancel the race because they did " not want a cloud to hang over the race or its participants			1
" " while holding the race would not require diverting resources from the recovery effort , it is clear that it has become the source of controversy and division , " the statement said			0
" we can not allow a controversy over an athletic event -- even one as meaningful as this -- to distract attention away from all the critically important work that is being done to recover from the storm and get our city back on track			0
" in the end , marathon did n't feel right the announcement was widely applauded on social media with @entity49 posts such as , " finally ... marathon cancelled ! after @entity51			1
" in a friday evening press conference , deputy mayor @entity52 elaborated on the cancellation of an event he said is traditionally " one of the very best days in the city , a moment of unity ... and joy			1
" yet the growing criticism of the race weighed on officials , including the sense that some @entity0 " found the marathon -- the very idea of it -- to be painful			1
" " it was clear that this was not going to be a celebration of @entity0			2
it was going to be a divisive , difficult day , " @entity52 said			0
" that 's not what anybody wanted			0
" @entity74 , the ceo of the @entity75 , said one factor in the decision to nix this year 's race was what she saw as an emerging " animosity toward the runners			1
" " we became concerned that ... no runner -- the best in the world or somebody hoping to finish -- was going to receive the welcome that we thought they 'd receive , " @entity74 said			2
officials have been meeting for days to discuss what to do about the marathon , with a number of options being considered			0
these included postponing the race a few weeks , altering the course , having a shorter 10 - mile event , or even having a marathon just for the elite runners that had come to @entity0			1
crippled @entity0 subways spark infrastructure , climate questions but @entity74 said the decision was made to cancel this year 's race entirely , cognizant of the real - life strains on volunteers and that many participants had planned everything around a november 4 race date			1
while there has been significant progress since @entity6 , large swaths of the city remained without power friday and public transit options remain limited			0
first held in 1970 , the @entity2 attracts about 47,000 runners and 12,000 volunteers -- not to mention an estimated 2.5 million spectators who annually line the course , which goes through all five city boroughs			2
the race had been scheduled to begin sunday morning on @entity121 , where runners would have crossed the @entity123 into @entity124 and run through @entity125 before crossing the @entity126 into @entity127 and the @entity128			2
but the 26.2 - mile course does not include lower @entity127 , where heavy flooding left many neighborhoods in the dark			1
even with the travel woes caused by @entity6 , about 40,000 runners were expected to run this year 's marathon , according to @entity74			2
in addition to promising them places in the 2013 race , she apologized to them for the cancellation			0
" we are really sorry to the runners who have come from around the world , " @entity74 said			0
" we ask for their patience and understanding			0
" health risks after @entity6 @entity1 's @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152 contributed to this report .			0
