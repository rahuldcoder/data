@entity0 -- a drug addiction expert who testified that @entity3 suffered a " quite extensive " drug addiction acknowledged there was no evidence the singer used more painkillers than medically necessary			1
dr. @entity9 testified tuesday and wednesday for @entity10 in its defense of the wrongful death lawsuit filed by @entity3 's mother and children			1
lawyers for the concert promoter want to convince jurors that the singer was a secretive addict responsible for his own death from an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol			2
their executives had no way of knowing the singer was in danger when he was preparing for his comeback concerts in 2009 , they contend			0
@entity3 lawyers contend @entity10 executives are liable because they negligently hired , retained or supervised the doctor who used propofol to treat @entity3 's insomnia as he prepared for his comeback concerts during the last two months of his life			1
the conclusion that @entity3 was dependent on painkillers was not a revelation , considering @entity3 himself announced it when he cut his " @entity37 " tour short to enter a rehab program in 1993			2
" if he announced it to the world it 's not very private , is it ? " @entity3 lawyer @entity43 asked @entity9			0
" at that moment , he was not secretive , " @entity9 replied			0
@entity3 's drugs of choice were opioids , painkillers given to him by doctors repairing scalp injuries suffered in a fire and during cosmetic procedures to make him look younger , @entity9 testified			1
labeling @entity3 an addict could tarnish the singer 's image among jurors , but its relevance to @entity10 's liability is questionable			1
opioids played no role in @entity3 's death , according to the @entity62 coroner			1
his june 25 , 2009 , death was ruled a result of an overdose of propofol			0
dr. @entity67 told investigators he infused the singer with propofol for 60 consecutive nights to treat his insomnia so he could rest for rehearsals			0
the judge would not allow @entity9 to testify if he thought @entity3 was addicted to propofol			0
anesthesiologist : @entity3 recruited me to help with insomnia @entity9 said addiction happens when a chemical " hijacks the pleasure - reward pathways " in your brain			0
" you remain addicted for the rest of your life , " @entity9 testified			0
" @entity3 's addiction was quite extensive and i have very little doubt that his pleasure - reward pathways had been hijacked and he suffered from addiction , " he said			2
@entity9 conceded he saw no evidence that @entity3 used painkillers after he left rehab in 1993 until 2001 or between july 2003 and late 2008			2
he said it is not inconsistent for an addiction to go into remission			0
under cross examination wednesday morning , @entity9 conceded that he never saw evidence that @entity3 injected himself with narcotics , ever sought or used illegal drugs such as cocaine , meth or heroin , or abused drugs to produce euphoria or get high			1
there was also no evidence @entity3 used more painkillers than doctors prescribed , he said			1
@entity3 lawyers have never disputed the singer 's drug dependence			1
in fact , they contend that @entity10 executives , including one who was @entity3 's tour manager when he entered rehab , were negligent for paying a doctor $ 150,000 a month just to treat @entity3			1
the high salary created a conflict for the debt - ridden @entity67 , making it difficult for him to say no to @entity3 's demands for drugs			2
@entity122 , the @entity10 co-ceo who was in charge of @entity3 's 2009 " @entity125 " tour , was also tour manager for his " dangerous " tour in 1993			1
@entity9 acknowledged in testimony wednesday that there was evidence that @entity122 knew about @entity3 's painkiller addiction 15 years before his death			1
@entity9 ' testimony about the dangers of a doctor being too friendly with an addicted patient , which he said @entity67 was , could help the @entity139 ' case			0
" a very close friendship between an addicted patient and a doctor is problematic , " @entity9 testified			0
" it makes it much easier for a patient to ask for drugs and it makes it more difficult for a provider to resist			0
" the medical records of @entity67 's treatment of @entity3 between 2006 and 2008 -- when the singer lived in @entity152 -- showed no painkillers prescribed during seven visits			2
@entity67 's notes did show he treated @entity3 's complaints of insomnia with a sedative in 2008			2
wednesday was the 76th day of testimony in the trial , which is expected to conclude near the end of september .			0
