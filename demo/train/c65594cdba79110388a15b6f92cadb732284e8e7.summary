@entity0 , @entity1 -- smashing ! that pretty much sums up the waves coming to @entity1 this week			1
and depending on whom you ask -- weather forecasters or surfers -- that word means either life - threatening peril or enlivening fun			2
far offshore , @entity12 is driving some of the tallest breakers in years to crest at @entity15 - area beaches			1
the @entity16 has issued beach hazard and high surf warnings from more than 100 miles north of @entity19 down to the border of @entity21			2
the swells should last until friday			2
they have surfers reveling , according to @entity25 , because after a pretty tame season , finally : surf 's up ! and how			2
one surfer was sucked out in the current , but fortunately , famed big - wave surfer @entity30 was nearby			1
he and another surfer helped the man out			2
" we pushed the guy in , " @entity30 said			0
" i mean , he was ok , because he was still strong enough to swim well , ( but ) it was one of those ones where it could have easily gone bad			0
" he said many of the surfers off @entity41 were not used to waves as big as the ones this week			1
" the ocean loves those guys			0
it squeezes and holds them down for a little while , " @entity30 said			0
but it 's not a game , he said			0
" you got ta have your respect for the ocean , " @entity30 said			0
one person died in the water tuesday night , @entity57 spokesman @entity56 said , but it was unclear whether the death was directly related to the tumultuous surf			1
the surfer may have had a medical issue			1
lifeguards performed 115 rescues on tuesday , @entity56 said			1
the dangers " there is the potential for damaging and life threatening surf , " says the @entity16 , which predicts waves breaking at heights of 10 to 15 feet			1
they could erode away a lot of beach , and wrack buildings and infrastructure close to the shore			0
the pounding waves are paired with other dangers			1
" very strong rip currents and long shore currents will likely create extremely dangerous and life threatening conditions for anyone , " the @entity16 says			0
rip currents are hard - to - spot flows that can drag unsuspecting swimmers out to sea			0
long shore currents can shove them sideways down the shoreline			0
there are other dangers , thanks to the number of surfers			1
" but the real threat is the surfboards , " said @entity94 , a surfer who cut short a vacation in @entity96 to catch these " epic " waves			1
" it 's really dangerous when you 're paddling out there and a big set wave comes out , and four or five guys are all dropping at the same time , " he said			1
having an effect from afar @entity12 wo n't come anywhere near making landfall , @entity2 meteorologist @entity106 said			1
" it 's way offshore			0
" the closest it will come to the state is 800 miles away on thursday , he said			0
parched @entity1 wo n't even see any rain , which it is craving during an extended exceptional drought			1
but even at that distance , @entity12 's counterclockwise swirl is still washing waves up the @entity1 coastline			1
beaches facing the south and southeast will get hit with the heaviest surf			2
@entity122 ' joy it 's great for surfers			1
it 's where they want their waves			2
and how they like them			0
and this is the second time in short order that they 've gotten them			0
@entity135 , which is petering out , served them up nicely , too			0
surfers will be looking for " select focal points , " as @entity25 , a website for surfing enthusiasts , calls them , where its forecasters predict some waves cresting at well over 18 feet			1
it 's more than high enough to make for tall " pipes " : the hollow air tubes that top - heavy waves form when they roll over on themselves			2
surfers love navigating them , and @entity25 will be following the action via a slew of webcams			0
surf forecasters have broken down the height of the surf by time of day and particular beach			0
" @entity159 , " a point just off of @entity161 , looks like the place to be .			0

lifeguards called on 115 times to rescue **people** on tuesday
