-- through a bit of calendrical coincidence , @entity1 this year falls on april 20			1
that 's unfortunate because april 20 has become , through no fault of its own , the highest and holiest day of the pot smoker 's year			1
from its origins as the meeting time ( 4:20 p.m. ) of some @entity12 joint - passers in the early 70s , the 4/20 movement has evolved into an annual occasion for mass smoke - outs in leaf - friendly cities like @entity16 , @entity17 and my hometown of @entity20			1
so sunday should be replete with news coverage of sunrise services , @entity23 on the balcony and twentysomething bros sucking on burrito - size doobies			1
i expect to see at least one weedhead in bunny ears on the top - o - the - hour news : " meanwhile , in @entity31 ... " @entity32 , i am here to tell you : do n't take the extreme to represent the mainstream			1
what you see on sunday may be rude , crude and obnoxious			2
but it bears as much relevance to marijuana reform as @entity44 's raucous @entity43 does to the history of the @entity47 people			1
i say this as a middle - aged pot agnostic who 's living with the reality of legalized marijuana			1
eighteen months ago i became something of a canary in the cannabis coal mine			2
my home state of @entity57 voted to legalize marijuana			2
i was a father of two kids about to enter their teens			2
i had n't touched pot since college			2
initially against legalization , i switched my vote at the last minute			0
since then i 've been digging into the reasons behind that last - minute change of heart -- and , by extension , into the reasons so many @entity32 have recently changed their minds about marijuana			1
believe me , we did n't do it in order to party down with @entity73			0
we did it because our marijuana laws no longer made any sense			1
as i write this , i 'm flying from @entity78 to @entity16			0
in doing so i 'm exiting the state with the nation 's most kafkaesque marijuana laws and entering the state with the most regulated legal pot system in the world			1
cannabis lovers take @entity16 's 420 weekend to new highs do you know the main difference between the two ? it 's the number of people in prison for pot. in @entity94 , it 's not uncommon to serve five to ten years in prison for minor marijuana possession			1
that 's more than some rape , robbery , or aggravated manslaughter convictions			0
and it 's the main reason @entity94 has the highest per - capita prison population in the world			1
last week i spoke with a man who was caught with 2.8 grams of marijuana in his pocket during a classic stop - and - frisk			1
( do i need to tell you he 's black ? ) he 's the same age as me			0
he had a wife , a kid , a job			0
now he 's serving 13 years			2
" i do n't understand it , " he told me			0
" there are guys in my cell here for violent crimes , awful things , and they 're doing less time than me			0
if i think about it too much it drives me crazy			0
" i felt like i was talking with a modern - day @entity125			1
when i land in @entity16 , i 'll stop by the @entity127 shop over on @entity128 and buy two grams for $ 34 and change			1
no one will be harmed in the process			0
i 'll take the bud and a bottle of wine to dinner at a friend 's house			0
he 'll probably take a couple puffs on the pot ; i 'll take one myself , but probably concentrate on the @entity141			2
legal or not , weed 's not really my thing			0
how 's it working out for @entity16 ? since the city 's retail pot stores opened on january 1 , violent crime is down			2
cops used to arrest about 10,000 people every year for marijuana possession in @entity31			1
legal weed has n't inspired an army of hooligans to tear up the state			0
it 's just kept 10,000 people with a little bud in their pockets from being branded as criminals			0
instead of losing their jobs , they keep them			0
instead of draining tax dollars as prisoners , they contribute tax dollars as workers and consumers			0
there is hope for those in @entity94			1
an odd - bedfellows coalition of social justice campaigners and fiscal responsibility advocates have joined together to push for sentencing reform			2
that 's a long way from legalization , but it may bring some common sense to an area that 's suffered from a dearth of it over the past couple of decades			0
@entity184 , president of the conservative @entity185 , is no pot legalizer			2
he simply believes the sentence should fit the crime			0
ten years for a gram of marijuana ? " it offends many people 's sense of justice , including mine , " he told me			1
by the time i left @entity78 , it looked like reform might have a chance			0
the @entity201 editorial board declared that " pot possession penalties are too high , " and called for saner penalties -- a $ 100 fine and up to six months in jail			1
there was talk of considering more drug court deferrals and fewer @entity209 sentences			0
this is the day - to - day substance of marijuana reform in @entity32			1
some states are moving slowly toward legalization			0
others , like @entity94 , are n't down with that , but they are ready to reel in the worst excesses of the drug war			1
that 's something to keep in mind when the most outlandish pot smokers splash across your screens on sunday			1
the 4/20 shenanigans are an outlier			0
most beer drinkers do n't imbibe like @entity227 at @entity228 or spring breakers in @entity230			0
and i 'm finding it 's the same way with pot. the 4/20 exuberants are one - day extremists			1
the reality of legal pot is something more akin to my dinner in @entity16 : quiet , normal , and yes , almost boring			2
join us on @entity242 / @entity241 .			0

@entity244 looks at differences in marijuana laws in @entity31 and @entity94
in @entity94 , a second marijuana possession offense could get you 5 - 10 years in prison
in @entity31 , you can buy two grams for $ 34 and change , and never go to jail
april 20 is seen as a day of *celebration* for pot smokers
