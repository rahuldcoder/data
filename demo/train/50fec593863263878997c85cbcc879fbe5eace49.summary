the free concert closed out @entity18 's @entity17 , a month - long promotion that included performances by @entity21 and @entity22 in previous weeks			1
@entity24 ' 35 - minute set attracted 17,500 fans			1
the performance comes just one day after the release of the band 's latest studio album , " @entity30 " -- they released two additional albums without @entity8 -- and continues their 20th anniversary celebration , which includes receiving a star on the @entity36 , an upcoming documentary film and a world tour that kicks off friday , august 2 in @entity39			1
with more than 130 - million album sales worldwide , the @entity1 know they are the best - selling boy band of all time , but they also know this one - time golden statistic has , to a degree , lost its sheen amid the music 's industry 's new measures of success : ticket sales , sponsorships , downloads , clicks , tweets and likes			1
by this standard , the @entity1 are not quite back			1
with ages ranging from 33 ( @entity4 ) to 41 ( @entity8 ) , any one of the @entity1 could have been @entity58 's much older brother , if not his father -- and it 's not missed on the guys just how big a difference one generation can make			1
in a candid and revealing turn , the men of the @entity1 offer their take on music in the age of @entity69 , react to the " haters " and explain why starting their careers in schools , malls and pet stores was just right for them			1
@entity0 : describe your new album in a word			1
@entity0 : you have a lot of fans -- and a lot of haters out there			1
what do you say to those that question your cool factor , relevance and place in the music industry ? @entity4 : we never thought we were cool			1
@entity8 : we never claimed to be cool			1
@entity78 : we never said that			1
@entity4 : we 're just guys that love music			1
@entity8 : we love music			1
we do what we love and have fun and enjoy it , and put out positive vibes and energy			1
yeah man , just create ! @entity4 : we worked hard to get where we are now			2
it 's been 20 years , you know ? the grassroots approach starting overseas			2
starting in @entity107 when @entity108 did n't want to have any association with us			2
@entity6 : there was no @entity111 , you know ? you could n't just toss your music up in the air and let it stick somewhere			2
@entity0 : things were very different in the music business 20 years ago			2
what 's been the biggest challenge ? @entity8 : if you want to have a long career in this industry , it 's a given that there will be waves -- highs and lows -- like a boat rocking on the ocean			2
it goes up and down and up and down			2
knowing that and working through it and riding through it is what sustains you			2
as well as your fans			2
@entity78 : we do n't ever settle			2
we always try to set new goals for every album cycle			1
from the music to the producers to what we actually want to sing about , write about			2
and keep trying to push the limits of who we are and who we want to keep being and grow into			0
@entity0 : your first album came out in 1996 , but you 're calling this your 20 - year anniversary			1
what happened in ' 93 ? @entity8 : that 's when we formed			0
we got signed in ' 94 , beginning of ' 95 , but the five of us got together in ' 93			0
between when we got together and when we got signed , we went on the road and did a school tour in a van			1
there are still people who come up to us on the street and say , " you performed at my elementary school in @entity162 when i was 7 years old ! " we did n't play in bars to build our fan base , we played high schools , middle schools , elementary schools			0
@entity78 : grand opening of pet stores ! you name it ! @entity8 : the parking lot of a car dealership			1
wherever we could play and get exposure			0
wherever we could sing a cappella and show people that we 're not just pretty faces , we actually have talent , we can sing			0
we sing with passion , we sing with soul and we love to sing			0
that 's what we did			0
@entity0 : that was your @entity69 back then			0
@entity8 : yeah , we got discovered via a @entity190 tape to a record label			0
now people are uploading videos on the @entity111 and that 's how they get discovered			0
@entity0 : do you have an opinion about which way is harder ? @entity4 : it 's all relative			0
we 're not taking away from people 's hard work nowadays , it 's just a different world			0
i ca n't relate necessarily			0
i can only say what we 've gone through			0
but , the social media with @entity69 and everything , it does give people an opportunity to expose yourself and if you have talent it will come out			0
i think that 's a great thing			0
if we had had that back then , who knows ? @entity5 : but it was during that time that we were developing			1
@entity8 : we were growing			0
we were learning who we are			0
@entity4 : i think the fact that we took our time getting around the world , that 's one of the other reasons why we 're able to be here and have this staying power			1
because sometimes the social media , it 's so fast , that people get it , but to hold on to it , it is n't there			0
@entity0 : any last words ? @entity8 : ultimately , we just want to say that our fans -- number one -- is why we 're still here			0
