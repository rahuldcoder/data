in a country where bleaching creams are frequently used to chemically lighten skin tone , one savvy entrepreneur is fighting against the disfiguring practice			1
after 19 years of driving taxis , @entity5 was looking for a change			1
his journey for a new profession led him to @entity10 , @entity11 and ultimately back home to @entity13 , where he stumbled into his calling after producing a line of herbal cosmetics			1
in @entity13 , the practice of using creams and other cosmetic products to chemically lighten skin tone is fairly common , as it is in many @entity23 countries -- but the practice is known to have detrimental health effects , according to the @entity26			1
using his deep - rooted knowlege of herbs , @entity5 had an idea to help his fellow @entity13			1
now a household name in the @entity23 region , his @entity31 cosmetics has become a popular staple in beauty bags throughout the area			1
@entity5 , who won the @entity38 award bestowed by the @entity39 of @entity13 earlier this year , sat down with @entity40 to explain how he went from a humble taxi driver to a cosmetics king			1
@entity40 : what was your breakout product ? @entity46 : i started with @entity31 cream -- the natural skin restorer and beauty soap			1
it is a local soap produced by our forefathers ... it 's not all types of a disease that a cream can cure , but most of the skin ailments the cream can cure			1
that is why it 's written as a " natural skin restorer " -- it does n't bleach but rather enhances your color			1
@entity40 : where has this knowledge of organic cosmetics come from ? @entity68 : my father was a herbalist and my grandfather was a herbalist i tried to recall all those things that when i was young they sent me to the bush to collect			1
the herbs that we have here have a real potency of curing ... and when i started using them too i have realized that i did n't choose the wrong way of curing people			2
@entity40 : you had been working as a taxi driver since you dropped out of school			1
why the sudden need to mix things up ? @entity68 : when i found that my children were growing up , i told [ one of my taxi clients ] that i had to find something to do so that i would be able to look after my children very well			1
and he himself told me they needed to send someone to @entity10 , to go and learn how to operate printing a press			2
he sent me there , i learned and came back and they opened a printing press for me in @entity101			2
@entity40 : then after the printing press , came a stint in @entity11 ... @entity68 : they gave me the opportunity to go and i traveled to @entity11 where i started odd jobs ... i came back with about five buses and started a transport business , but unfortunately for me it was all accidents , one after the other			1
@entity40 : after all these accidents , you did n't give up though			2
you transformed one of the buses into a mobile grocery delivery service , right ? @entity68 : what i was doing was going to the villages , buying food stuffs , buying everything needed in the kitchen and coming to the residential areas and announcing the things that i had to sell			2
it was a very lucrative job			2
i did it for some time and i saw that the work was so tedious because sometimes i had to go to the bush myself , carry the load , uproot the coco yam , cassava , and that stuff by myself and age was catching up with me			2
so i decided that this work , i ca n't do it for long because if age caught up with me i ca n't go to the bush to carry those food stuffs , so i decided to try another thing			2
@entity40 : so where did the name " @entity31 " come from ? @entity68 : this name " @entity31 " is in the memory of a dear friend , who has passed on			2
that name " @entity31 " was a nickname between us			0
@entity40 : and how did you know organic skin care products would take off the way they did ? @entity68 : i went to the market and bought creams that are manufactured and produced by foreign countries , powders and perfumes , and went around announcing those things for sale and it was really doing very well			1
@entity40 : so you decided to start producing locally and it 's been quite the success			0
has it been an easy ride ? @entity68 : the economy is always fluctuating			0
you know we have n't got a permanent exchange rate for our currency			0
i 'm an herbalist , i produce other products but some things , fragrance and petroleum jelly and that sort of stuff			0
we import them so at the time of importation you calculate based on the exchange rate , before the goods would arrive in the country , [ sometimes ] the exchange rate would shoot upwards			0
@entity40 : you seem to face these obstacles head on and industry leaders have noticed			0
how did it feel to be honored as the " @entity181 " in april ? @entity68 : [ @entity182 ] somebody who started from nowhere , if i am in this area and being recognized that i am the entrepreneur of the year , obviously , i cherish this the most ... it means they are appreciating what i am doing , so i was very happy			1
@entity40 : and after receiving these honors , you 're also trying the " pay it forward " mentality by helping build schools and provide computers in classrooms ? @entity68 : i 'm not educated but i 'm always happy when i see children in school			0
you know here in @entity199 , it 's not all people who get [ the ] opportunity to go to school			0
education is a lost treasure for every human being			0
that is why i 'm always passionate even if i did not get the change to educate myself very well			0
now that @entity208 has given me that power , everywhere that i see that need [ for ] education , if it is in my power , i help them			0
@entity40 : last question , what advice do you have for any budding businessmen ? @entity68 : nobody should think that because they did n't go to a classroom to sit on a chair i 'm not educated			0
we can always educate ourselves wherever we go			0
that is a courageous way of life			0
whatever dreams that we have , we should think that it 's human beings who can do anything in this world			0
opinion : diaspora should have a voice , too			0
