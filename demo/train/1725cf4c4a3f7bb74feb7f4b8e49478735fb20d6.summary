-- a slow - moving landslide the size of two football fields is steadily tearing apart a hilltop house from the inside and has prompted the evacuation of about 50 people and several businesses in the well - known skiing town of @entity11 , @entity12 , officials said saturday			1
the slow movement , however , has only a 5 % chance of becoming the sort of violent landslide that killed 36 people last month in rural @entity18 , said @entity19 , @entity11 assistant town manager			1
" you know , i think that 's on everybody 's mind , but i think our slide is different because it 's slow moving			1
theirs was catastrophic , and ours has been slowly creeping down the hill , " @entity26 said saturday			0
the 100 - foot - deep landslide is moving so slowly that local officials have been able to see how ground cracks are emerging and growing by inches each day the past week			1
crews use binoculars to keep an eye on the hill while they stand at a fire truck across the road			0
a mandatory evacuation order issued thursday to 46 residential units in the landslide zone remained in place saturday			1
authorities count about 57 residents in the landslide area , but only 48 people have reported to a @entity47 check - in station , @entity26 said			1
the remainder are still residing in their homes or may be away from home , she said			2
" there are people living there who have refused to leave			0
that 's their choice because we ca n't forcibly remove them , " @entity26 said			2
" on one side of the ( hillside ) road , we did have a sinkhole develop , and it 's not safe to dig it out and put a man in the hole			2
on saturday , about 43 people were escorted to their homes to remove personal items and check on the security of their belongings , according to a press release from the town of @entity11			1
emergency personnel will continue to escort residents to their home sunday			2
starting monday , escorts back to residences will be by appointment only , according to the press release			0
@entity47 personnel trained a dozen local people saturday to staff a public shelter they plan to open sunday evening			0
for now , officials are doing testing extending 100 feet underground to determine how big of a threat the slide is and what they can do to limit its impact , @entity26 said			1
the town has hired a geologist to examine the matter			0
at a minimum , a house atop a hill is unlikely to be inhabitable again because its interior wooden floor is splitting into two , @entity26 said			0
the driveway is cracked by a 6 - to 12 - inch upward fissure in the ground , she added			0
" what really struck me is the wood flooring , which is separating , " she said			0
" one half of the house looks like it 's on side of the slide area and the other half is definitely at the crest of the slide			2
" we did a media tour yesterday , " she said saturday , " and after we did that , the geologist said , ' you ca n't do that anymore			0
' " the slow landslide began march 4 when the event moved a town water pumphouse and broke a 16 - inch water main , sending water gushing into a two - lane highway , @entity26 said			1
the landslide is occurring about a mile west of the town center , on a stretch of highway that 's home to a @entity126 that opened with the new year , two restaurants and a liquor store -- all of which are closed for now , @entity26 said			2
the broken water main forced local officials to lay a two - inch water line up the steep hill 's surface to connect to 46 residential units -- houses and apartments -- in the landslide zone , @entity26 said			1
on saturday , crews installed water tanks on the hill as a fire prevention measure because the temporary two - inch water line is n't sufficient for potential firefighting , @entity26 said .			0
