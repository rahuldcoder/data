-- @entity2 's big spending on @entity4 's transfer deadline day has been criticized by one of the club 's @entity7 rivals , who questioned how the @entity11 champions can meet @entity4 's new financial fair - play rules			1
the @entity14 team announced a loss of $ 113 million on monday for the year ended june 30 , 2010 -- but then smashed the @entity17 transfer record with a reported $ 80 million acquisition of @entity20 striker @entity19 , and also laid out $ 34 million for @entity22 defender @entity21			1
the @entity19 deal allowed his former club @entity24 to spend $ 55 million on @entity27 's relatively unproven @entity26 striker @entity25 , who is injured , and $ 36 million on @entity28 forward @entity29			1
however , @entity31 football 's governing body @entity4 will take sanctions against clubs who can not balance their books by the end of the 2012 reporting period			1
the best and worst deals of a dramatic deadline day @entity2 's @entity14 rivals @entity40 were again quiet in the january transfer window , and manager @entity42 questioned the tactics of the @entity47 ' billionaire @entity45 owner @entity44			1
" @entity2 supported @entity4 's financial fair - play proposals but in the morning they announced a £ 70 million loss and in the afternoon they buy £ 75 million worth of players			1
where 's the logic in that ? " he told reporters after tuesday 's 2 - 1 @entity11 win over @entity54			2
" it 's hard to guess			2
officially they vote for financial fair play , but they can explain why they have done this much better than i can			0
@entity44 can tell you why , but that 's how you can read it from the outside			2
" if you do n't invest for a while , it looks as if you 're not as involved in it anymore , that he does n't like it as much			0
but £ 75 million means more will come			0
" @entity44 was a bit in no - man 's land where nobody could guess if he wanted to still invest or not			0
he has been like that for a long time , but that has changed			0
he has decided to put big money in again and that tells you in the summer more will come			0
he is back to full investment			0
" @entity82 , vice-president of @entity84 club @entity83 , also criticized the level of spending in @entity26 -- which reached a record $ 363 million			1
" everyone 's talking about balancing the books but then they spend like crazy people , " he told reporters			2
" @entity2 strengthened in an amazing way , spending 80 million euros			1
i just do n't know where financial sense will end up			0
" @entity2 sign @entity19 and @entity21 in frantic end to deadline day @entity2 dressed up the club 's financial results by saying they were " cash positive " with a net inflow of £ 3.8 million compared to an outflow of £ 16.9 million in 2008 - 09			1
" the club is in a strong position to meet the challenges of @entity4 ' financial fair play ' initiatives which will be relevant to the financial statements to be released in early 2013 , " chief executive @entity102 told the @entity2 website			2
@entity4 released a statement saying that clubs " are increasingly aware of the nature of the financial fair - play rules , which aim to encourage clubs to balance their incomes and expenses over a period of time covering four to six transfer windows			2
" it refused to comment on individual clubs , but said the rules did not stop them from spending money on transfers as such -- the emphasis is on balancing books at the end of the season			1
" there is no doubt that transfers made now will impact on the break - even results of the financial years ending 2012 and 2013 -- the first financial years to be assessed under the break - even rule , " @entity4 said			0
" the clubs know the rules and also know that @entity4 is fully committed to implementing them with rigor			0
as from this summer , all payments due on transfers and to employees will be assessed by the @entity140 as part of the ' enhanced overdue payables ' rule			0

@entity40 manager *unhappy* with @entity2 's $ *114* million outlay on two players
@entity42 says spending shows no logic after announcing a *massive* loss
@entity83 official also criticizes @entity26 's record level of january outlay
@entity31 clubs must balance their books by end of 2012 or face sanctions
