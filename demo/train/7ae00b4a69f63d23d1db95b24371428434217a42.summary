-- @entity1 , the used car dealer with that small lot down on the corner , may be your mother 's cousin , but that does n't mean you 'll get the best used car deal in town from him			0
he sells all brands of cars , has no visible shop or mechanical staff , and he is the only one that stands behind the quality of his cars ... until the rear tires clear his driveway			0
the numbers of items inspected on the cars range from 100 to 300			0
a better used car ? if shopping for regular used cars , whether it be at a dealer or private party , just is n't cutting it for you , there may be a better solution -- choosing to buy from a new - car dealer who also operates a @entity33 ( @entity33 ) used car program			1
these programs are operated jointly by the manufacturer and the dealer , and practically guarantee the quality , condition , and future long life of the car , truck , crossover , or suv you 're interest in			1
it 's in the dealer 's and the manufacturer 's best interest to find the best used cars available for these programs , so most of the cars sold through them are clean , undamaged cars coming off of two - or three - year leases or out of rental - car fleet service			2
restrictions on which vehicles are allowed in the program , such as age and mileage , vary			0
some cars in @entity33 programs could be as young as six months and have only 6000 miles on them , as in @entity66 's program , and others could be as much as five years old and have a maximum of 80,000 miles on the odometer , in the case of @entity71			1
inspection and warranty although the content and extent of each brand 's certified pre-owned program varies , one of the constants is the complete vehicle inspection offered by every program			1
though the number of items -- or points -- inspected on the vehicle varies from 100 to 300 , as a consumer you should feel comfortable knowing that everything important on the car was inspected by the dealer , under the guidelines of the manufacturer , and the worn or bad parts were replaced , if necessary , before the vehicle was put into the program			2
aside from the inspections , the length and coverage of the certified - vehicle warranty also varies from program to program , and the buyer should make absolutely sure that the original manufacturer is offering the warranty , as opposed to a third - party or extended - warranty company			1
depending on a vehicle 's age , condition and mileage , it may in fact be cheaper to buy an uncertified used car from a dealer and then purchase a separate extended warranty for the vehicle			2
the @entity33 bumper - to - bumper warranties can be a bit complicated , so be sure to do your homework and become familiar with all the ins - and - outs			1
some of the warranties start when the car is sold to you , and some warranties start from the date of the original sale or in - service date of the vehicle , but are extended up to six years or 100,000 miles			2
certified used car buyers should be sure to read and understand every paragraph of the vehicle and powertrain warranties offered with the vehicle so there are no surprises later			1
some warranties also require the buyer to pay a predetermined deductible amount for each repair ; some do n't ( @entity66 , for instance , charges a flat fee of $ 50 for any warranty repair )			0
some @entity33 warranties are even transferable to the next owner after you , which may be an attraction when it comes time to sell it			1
in most cases , the original long - term powertrain and corrosion penetration warranty will still apply			0
you also get perks beyond the usual vehicle inspection thoroughness and the length of the certified - vehicle warranty , the various manufacturers and dealers offer a large menu of extras on their certified pre-owned vehicles as enticements to a deal			1
what if you buy a @entity33 vehicle , load your kids into it , and it stops running halfway to grandma 's house ? most programs offer 24/7 roadside assistance for such situations on a @entity33 vehicle ( @entity175 , for instance , offers this feature for a full ten years and unlimited mileage from the original in - service date )			1
some offer temporary vehicle loans while your vehicle is being repaired			2
others go even further than that , offering trip interruption insurance that will pay you up to $ 1,500 toward your living expenses while your @entity33 vehicle is being repaired and / or partial reimbursement for a taxi , shuttle or rental car during the repair period			1
what if you sign on the bottom line , take the vehicle home , and nobody likes it ? some companies offer a no - strings return policy after three days or 150 miles of home - based test driving ( @entity203 offers seven days and 500 miles )			2
others offer special financing rates on @entity33 vehicles to make the deal as attractive as possible			1
another potential deal - sealer is a free @entity210 report on the car before you buy it , a feature offered by @entity213			0
a few @entity33 programs include the @entity215 as well			1
still other goodies could include free lock - out service , free car washes on each warranty visit , and preferential treatment in the service queue			0
@entity222 offers free tire changing , lock - out , jump start , an oil filter change , and emergency fuel delivery in addition to other benefits			0
others offer free trip routing and maps			0
@entity234 , for instance , sweetens its deals with @entity237 companion tickets , free membership in the @entity239 , free magazines , and a @entity234 club liaison			0
it 's all there , in the fine print			0
is it worth it ? due to the costs involved in the inspection , certification and warranties process , a certified used car will almost always be more expensive than a normal used car or one from a private party out of the classifieds			2
how much more ? from two to eight percent higher , according to @entity255 research			2
premium - brand vehicles will be priced even higher because there are more items to warranty on a luxury car than there are on a basic @entity262 or @entity263			0
but , look at it this way : you can get a thoroughly inspected and guaranteed , slightly used two - to - five - year - old vehicle for far less money than you 'd have to pay for it new			1
add to that attractive interest rates , with lots of extra perks in the deal , including the security of a longer warranty			0
can @entity277 match that ? we do n't think so			0

certified pre-owned programs may save you money
manufacturers and dealers may also toss in perks
buying a @entity33 vehicle will cost 2 to 8 percent more
