-- the going is always soft and the only permanent building is a toilet block			0
it 's the antithesis to the pomp and pageantry of @entity7 ... welcome to @entity8			1
if you overlook @entity8 beach , a mere 30 miles north of the capital @entity12 on @entity14 's east coast , you would usually see golden sand stretching far and wide , the tide pulsing in and out of shore , the elements battering the coastline and the occasional dog walker			1
but for a few hours each year , as has been the custom ever since 1868 , it becomes the site of arguably the world 's most unique annual racehorse meeting			1
racegoers from all over the globe have attended the september event , including musicians , film stars and royalty , while top trainers and leading jockeys have also played their part			2
" there truly is nothing like it , it 's truly unique , " says @entity35 , who was born and brought up in @entity8 and is one of a small team that runs the meeting			1
" i think it 's the only race meeting in the world that can truly be described as unique			1
i think there 's beach racing in @entity48 but this is the only one that completely adheres to the rules of racing			1
but it 's a bit less formal			0
" forces of nature unlike @entity7 , where top hat and tails are the order of the day for attendees , @entity57 merely asks that punters , of which there are typically about 5 - 6,000 each year , aim for smart casual			2
" my first memory of the racing is coming down to the beach as a child and playing football , " he recalls			1
" the game would start with six of us and then end with 26 by the time various people had finished their tea			0
" during the end of the summer , you 'd gradually see the beach taking shape for the racing			1
" but there was such a mystery about it too as a child , how it all appeared and suddenly happened			0
in this role ( which he has had since 1998 ) , i realize there is no mystery , just a lot of logistics and hard work ! " that is not merely setting up the venue for the event but battling the forces of nature -- the past year the coastal erosion has been even more noticeable			2
but come rain , shine or even wartime , @entity8 has almost always gone ahead			1
its last cancellation came in 2002 when a deluge caused storm waters to overspill , making it no longer safe to start the racing			2
" we do n't know what @entity102 will throw at us on a particular date , " @entity57 says			0
star attraction on thursday there will be six races , each with a maximum of 10 horses and all run over six to seven furlongs , across the width of the beach			1
@entity57 hopes there will once again be notable names in attendance			0
the @entity123 visited in the 1950s , the actors from movies " @entity119 " and " @entity120 , " both of which were filmed in @entity8 , are believed to have attended , while @entity124 , singer with @entity125 , has been a regular			1
celebrities , though , are treated no differently to any other patrons -- who come from as far afield as @entity129 and the @entity130			2
" we would n't know who most of them were and anyway we 'd leave them be , " says @entity57			0
" they 're all here for the same thing as us , are n't they ? " @entity140 's former ambassador to @entity14 , @entity141 , was so drawn by a picture of @entity8 in the @entity143 that he felt compelled to visit			1
" it 's really something , " he said			0
" i 've never seen anything like it			0
to have horses racing out in the natural environment is wonderful			2
" it is a meeting that comes with everything you 'd expect at a normal course -- the racing rails , winning post , a grandstand , jockey weighing room ( though in a marquee ) and even now a tent for corporate facilities			1
entrance is the same price for everyone , just $ 10 , while you can place a bet with bookmakers there			2
but do n't expect to see horses of the caliber of @entity171 winners at @entity8			2
" the racing is pretty ordinary really , " @entity57 admits			0
" i remember speaking to @entity173 , an up - and - coming jockey , last year , and asking him what it was like to ride			0
" i thought he 'd say it was a magical experience but he just told me it was ' slow , slower than other years			0
' " tragedy brings change building the course is a race against time			2
when the tide goes out , organizers shovel up and pat down the sand to create the racing line , but such are the elements that occasional pools of surface water can remain , which some horses do n't mind but others despise -- merely another nuance to the racing at @entity8			1
as magical and mystical as the event sounds , it has not been without its own setbacks			0
twenty years ago marked its bleakest year , with three equine fatalities and two riders seriously injured			0
" one of the jockeys never rode again , " says @entity57 ruefully			0
back then , the horses used to charge out to sea , with the field turning back on themselves in a semicircle			0
major safety changes were brought in , and @entity57 says organizers had to plead with @entity14 's racing authorities to keep holding the event			1
" other changes meant only horses over the age of four could compete , and horses were not allowed to wear blinkers , " he adds			0
the racing was allowed to carry on and , 146 years since the first meeting at @entity8 , the event goes from strength to strength -- the @entity221 flows , the music plays and hooves thunder in the sand .			1
