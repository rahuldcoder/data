-- warning : this article contains potential spoilers for the upcoming issue of " @entity4			1
" he 's one of the most famous villains in pop culture for a reason			0
@entity9 , @entity4 's archenemy , has been terrorizing the @entity11 and his allies over these past few months in a number of " @entity4 " comic books , and it 's all coming to a head in wednesday 's issue of " @entity4 " # 17 ( published by @entity17 , which is owned by @entity18 , as is @entity0 )			1
the book 's writer , @entity19 , promises an ending that is sure to shock bat - fans to their cores			1
the crossover story 's title , " @entity27 , " recalls a 25 - year - old story -- called " @entity28 " -- in which the second @entity29 , @entity30 , was brutally murdered by @entity9 ( after a poll in which fans voted by phone as to whether the boy wonder should live or die )			1
@entity19 is mum as to whether @entity4 and all of his friends will survive this encounter with the @entity9 , but he did speak to @entity0 about what readers can expect			1
@entity0 : what themes did you aim to explore with " @entity27 ? " @entity19 : the story came to me after i had my second kid			1
you sometimes wish that you did n't have to worry about your kids all the time			0
@entity4 has all these allies , this " family			2
" @entity4 has to sometimes wish that he would n't have to worry about @entity29 , @entity47 or @entity48			1
who to take that wish and twist it into a nightmare but @entity9 ? he says , " i will take care of that , i will kill them			2
" @entity4 would say he never wished for that			2
@entity9 would tell @entity4 , " yes , you wished that , you just do n't want to admit it			1
" @entity9 in this story is a devil 's tongue			2
he makes you frightened of yourself , which the best villains in literature do			0
for my story , @entity9 sees himself as serving @entity4			1
historically , the court jester was the only one who could deliver terrible news to the king			0
he sees @entity4 as this wonderfully twisted bat - king			2
he sees himself as making him a tougher , stronger king			0
he sees @entity4 as deep down wanting to be the protector of @entity75 , but his allies are his " false court			2
" @entity0 : aside from the reference to " @entity28 , " what is the meaning of the title ? @entity19 : we wanted it to echo that horrible moment in @entity4 's life			1
we wanted @entity9 for the first time ever to come after the @entity4 family with this murderous mission in mind			2
he usually does it to get at @entity4			2
he says he 's coming after them to bring out @entity4 's worst nightmare for the first time ever			1
this is @entity9 's war on @entity4 and even more so , on his family			1
@entity0 : why the changes to @entity9 's appearance ? @entity19 : the way he looks now came about in " detective comics " # 1 ( in 2011 )			1
the writer on that book , @entity100 , wanted to take @entity9 outside of @entity75 for a while , to create new bad guys			2
we thought that would be a great place in which to leave him			0
we decided this would work thematically for this story			0
in " @entity4 " # 17 you 'll learn why he did it , why he had his face cut off and strapped back on			1
this final issue will bring everything crashing down			0
@entity0 : why is @entity9 such a threat ? what is his biggest weakness ? @entity19 : @entity9 is my favorite villain in literature in general			1
my folks have embarrassing @entity125 pictures of me dressed as @entity9			0
down at its core , he 's scary in and of himself			0
clowns are scary , but he 's physically scary and capable of doing horrifying things			0
he scares @entity4 about himself			0
he makes @entity4 afraid there 's a hint of madness in him			2
he tries to make @entity4 believe the madness is true			0
" you 're as crazy as me , you belong in @entity136			0
" he feels that @entity4 deep down wants this to happen			0
exposing the scariest things about ourselves , the scariest things we have in our hearts , and to laugh at them -- in its purest and most vicious form , that 's what a great and monstrous villain does			0
his weakness is he does n't see things coming outside of @entity4			0
if @entity4 did n't care and did n't look for him , it would hurt @entity9 in a way he 's not expecting			1
it 's a vicious cycle			0
there 's an achilles heel in his own obsession with @entity4			2
@entity0 : does any villain come in second to @entity9 in your mind ? @entity19 : each one represents a different weakness or fear @entity4 has for himself			1
the @entity162 -- who i 'm about to use in a big way in 2013 -- is a manifestation of @entity4 's fear that he 's not smart enough , he 's not able to solve the puzzle in time to save the city			1
@entity162 keeps him as sharp as he can be			0
all of these villains figure in " @entity4 " # 16 and # 17 too			1
@entity9 sees them representing some facet of @entity4 's psychology			1
two - face is kind of the nightmare of @entity4 's life			1
will you become this horrifying version of yourself , like @entity173 ? each represents some deep fear in the rich and complicated personality that is @entity4			0
@entity162 , two - face , @entity183 -- all of these characters will figure into @entity4 in the coming year			0
@entity0 : so how big and dramatic is this finale ? how much of an impact will it have on @entity4 and @entity17 ' current universe ? @entity19 : it has a big impact on the whole mythology of @entity4 , and certainly with the stories coming afterward , it will have a big effect on many of the books -- emotional and lasting effects i do n't want to give away			1
@entity0 : it feels like the stakes are being raised in superhero comics more and more in recent years , with more dramatic changes			2
why do you think this is ? @entity19 : it 's not so much to make the books as dramatic as possible or to be shocking , but to try to tell the best story you can that feels organic			1
it 's not been a marching order			0
( my editors ) say , write this character as if you had just one chance to write him ; proceed that way			0
what if i had these six issues , what would i do to tell this story ? it 's exciting to have that opportunity .			0
