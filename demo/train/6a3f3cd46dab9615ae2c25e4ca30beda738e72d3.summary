@entity0 -- in the week between her death and her funeral , @entity2 are having an awkward time coming to terms with the legacy of @entity9 , a prime minister who last held office 23 years ago -- meaning no one under 40 could have voted for her , yet the mix of anger and admiration is spread across the generations			1
the emotional outpouring in this famously undemonstrative nation is matched in recent memory only by the death of @entity20 , when flowers piled up outside royal palaces and @entity26 's mawkish " @entity25 " surged to the top of the charts			2
but while @entity20 was mourned in unity by millions as the " people 's princess , " @entity9 's death is being marked in widely different and unpredictable ways			1
watch : not everyone 's mourning @entity9 's death it has become an overused adjective in the media that @entity9 was " divisive			1
" some countries might put aside political differences and unite to respect the passing of a leader -- especially the first and only female pm , who won three successive general elections			0
but in the @entity2 debate about @entity9 is raging almost as fiercely as it did in the 1980s over issues like the privatization of industries , the @entity48 , tax and social policy , her close relationship with @entity54 president @entity53 and combative stance against the @entity56			1
to many she was the woman who broke the mold , showing the way for others , and the leader who made " @entity2 great again , " according to pm @entity61			2
@entity62 , aka " @entity62 " from the 1990s girl band the @entity64 , spoke for many when she tweeted this tribute : " thinking of our 1st lady of girl power , @entity9 , a grocer 's daughter who taught me anything is possible ... x. " @entity62 later deleted the tweet in the face of online criticism , but went on to regret the move , describing herself as " weak " and cowardly			1
despite a generation having grown up since she left power , @entity9 's supporters and critics remain passionate and loud -- including many too young to have known her reign directly			1
on the day her death was announced , impromptu parties popped up in cities across the land -- especially areas that saw unrest three decades ago such as @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 , in south @entity0 , as well as former coal - mining communities devastated by long - term unemployment			1
the right - wing @entity96 tabloid newspaper was again outraged , blaming three decades of " vitriol and hatred from the left			0
" and as members of parliament gathered in parliament on wednesday to honor her from the conservative benches and recognize or revile her from the @entity109 side , bosses at the state - funded @entity101 were grappling with a new problem -- whether to air the song " @entity112 ! the witch is dead " from " @entity115 " on its weekly chart show			0
the song reached @entity117 in the national charts after it was adopted by an @entity120 group on @entity121 and @entity122 , prompting a backlash in newspapers that supported @entity9 , like the @entity96 , which denounced the architects of the protest as " teachers of hatred " and " revolting			2
" in the end , only a 5 - second clip of the song was played , a messy compromise that pleased neither side			0
meanwhile , soccer clubs , some of which are owned by @entity9 supporters , said it would be appropriate to hold a minute 's silence to honor her memory before kick - off at weekend games			1
but even @entity9 's former sports minister @entity142 went on the record to say this was a bad idea			2
the message between the lines was that basically , fans could not be trusted to show respect			0
the @entity149 later decided against it , and none were held at any major fixtures			0
" a minute silence is to mark and remember football people			0
or moments of national tragedy where all unite , say 9/11 or remembrance sunday ... " explained @entity158 , a football writer for @entity160 newspaper			0
" it was above politics			0
they have never had a minute 's silence for a political figure			2
by definition it is divisive			0
" if the @entity170 's death alone was not enough to reopen old wounds , her " ceremonial funeral with military honors , " planned for next week , certainly has			1
like the services for the @entity177 in 2001 , @entity20 in 1997 , and the state funeral for wartime leader @entity179 in 1965 , the coffin will be transported from @entity180 to @entity181 on a gun - carriage escorted by 700 military personnel , including those who fought in the @entity186 conflict against @entity188 's annexation of the remote @entity190 islands			2
the service is really a state funeral in all but name ; although it is not dictated by parliament there will be plenty of pomp and for the first @entity170 's funeral since @entity179 's , @entity198 will attend			1
the @entity160 reported on friday though that @entity9 herself wanted a more low - key funeral ( " i 'm not @entity179 , " she reportedly said ) but the current conservative - led coalition government appears to have over-ridden her wishes			1
the @entity96 is not so easily brushed aside though , and at the end of last week was urging its 1 million - plus readers to send off coupons for a full state funeral			2
in the current climate , police are braced for protests from troublemakers			0
why then does @entity9 continue to cause such trouble after her death ? in years to come , it may be significant that she died on the same day many of the coalition 's austerity cuts started to bite			1
on april 8 , major benefit curbs took effect while the top rate of income tax was cut from 50 % to 45 % for those earning more than Â £ 150,000 ( 230,000 ) , and the coalition government is attracting much flak for its economic policies			0
the cost of the funeral has also caused a ruckus , with many calling for a more low - key remembrance			1
" in a context where there is great ill feeling about her legacy , " said the @entity232 , @entity9 's own birthplace , " we have a situation where we seem to be expecting the nation to glorify that with a Â £ 10 million funeral is asking for trouble			1
people with extreme views will use it to promote their political views			0
" and if @entity61 , @entity9 's successor as @entity250 leader , had hoped that her death would boost his own fortunes , he 'll be disappointed			1
this week it was revealed that support for the party had sunk to an all - time low			0
in contrast to his own low personal ratings , his predecessor 's death may remind voters that @entity9 was in a league of her own when it came to political charisma			1
as @entity263 pointed out this week , @entity179 may have won @entity264 , " but he never created an ' - ism			0
' " the end of the thatcher - era also comes at a point when many politicians are debating to what extent the neo-liberal economic model espoused by @entity9 is to blame for the economic crisis of the last five years and what direction to take next			2
and while a scab on the wounds inflicted by @entity277 communities by @entity9 grew during the years since her downfall in 1990 , the death of the " @entity9 " has brought them all back into the open			2
those on the right are saying " what the world needs now is more @entity277 , not less , " while those on the left decry " her demeanor and every discernible action ( that ) seemed to be to the detriment of our national spirit and identity			0
" for the next few days , the front line of this battle appears to have been drawn in @entity2 pubs , around its dining tables and on the streets of its cities .			0
