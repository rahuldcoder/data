-- last weekend , suspected @entity2 jihadists killed at least 40 students at a northern @entity5 agricultural college , many while they slept			1
the @entity8 @entity7 @entity6 shows that jihadist - related attacks in @entity7 are increasing			1
most of the victims in this violence are @entity13 , but some are @entity15			0
while no group has claimed responsibility for sunday 's massacre , the @entity5 media assigns responsibility to @entity21 , and the operation has the hallmarks of the group 's previous massacres			1
what is @entity21 ? it remains shrouded in mystery			1
@entity21 is the @entity29 word for " book , " and commonly refers to @entity32 education			1
@entity33 is the @entity35 word for " forbidden			0
" hostile to democracy , modern science , and @entity32 education as @entity39 , it is highly diffuse			1
for some adherents , religious , even apocalyptic , themes appear to be paramount			0
they are looking toward the creation of @entity45 's kingdom on earth through violence against those they see as @entity2 's enemies , rather than the achievement of a political program			0
but , political opportunists and criminals also operate under the label of " @entity21			1
" the movement 's umbrella appears to be a shared @entity2 vocabulary of protest , a hatred of the secular government in @entity62 and of a corrupt @entity5 political economy -- and a disposition toward violence			1
it is especially murderous toward members of the @entity2 establishment that have " sold out " to @entity62			0
it does not appear to have an overarching political structure , and @entity71 , the leader of perhaps its largest element , does not exercise universal command or control over many of its elements			0
does this pose a threat to @entity81 or other @entity32 interests ? should ties between the @entity81 and the @entity62 government strengthen under the guise of a common " war on terror , " @entity81 interests -- though limited in @entity7 -- could become a @entity21 target , not least because " the friend of my enemy is my enemy			1
" thus far , @entity21 has shown little interest in the world outside of @entity7 and the @entity94			1
but the situation in @entity7 is dynamic , and it is possible that closer ties will develop between @entity98 and elements of @entity21			1
the group was founded by @entity101 , a charismatic preacher who was murdered by police in 2009 in a public episode that went viral on the internet			2
but , even with respect to @entity101 's core disciples , there is remarkably little hard information about their structure and leadership			2
after @entity101 's murder , leadership fell to his deputy , @entity71			0
he normally communicates through videos , and has not been seen in person since @entity101 's death			0
his latest video appeared in september 2013			0
the revolt 's foot soldiers likely are drawn from unemployed youth in @entity7 , a region of profound poverty			1
many of them attended @entity2 schools where they learned little other than to memorize the @entity126			0
often they are children of peasants , rootless if not homeless , in a big city			0
they can bond through a common radical @entity2 sensibility , inchoate rage , and the prospect of earning a little money as terrorists			0
up until 2012 , @entity21 attacks appeared to be largely funded by bank robberies			2
one commentator credibly estimated that there had been several dozen since 2011			0
@entity21 has successfully looted weapons from government arsenals			2
what is new is @entity21 's use of suicide bombers			2
suicide is anathema to @entity146 culture , and had been unknown as a weapon of terror in @entity7			1
@entity146 borders are porous , and travel between @entity7 and areas where @entity152 -- the @entity153 - jihadist militant group -- operates is easy			1
yet , while there is evidence of communication between different groups in the region , there continues to be little sign that @entity98 's influence has been transformative			2
instead of the international jihad , @entity21 continues to be focused primarily on internal @entity5 issues			1
it shows little interest in southern @entity7 , let alone @entity165 or the @entity81			1
still , @entity7 's federal government is addressing @entity21 as an @entity98 - linked terrorist movement			1
on may 14 president @entity168 declared a state of emergency in the three northern states of @entity171 , @entity172 , and @entity173 , where @entity21 normally concentrates			2
but the heavy security presence , especially during the state of emergency in these areas , is dysfunctional			0
there is a downward spiral , with soldiers resorting to brutality on an increasingly hostile population			0
on the other hand , soldiers and police are primary targets of @entity21 , and their casualty levels are high			2
an endgame is hard to foresee			0
in the past , millenarian @entity2 movements have burned themselves out , often under military pressure			0
there are few signs this process is under way			0
and the military appears incapable of controlling it			0
if @entity21 is not going away , it is also unlikely to be able to overthrow the @entity5 state			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity200 .			2

@entity200 : *islamist* @entity21 suspected in slaughter of @entity5 students
he says the @entity7 - focused group opposes democracy , science , @entity32 education .
if @entity7 , @entity81 unite in " war on terror , " the group is ripe to for @entity98 ties
@entity200 : @entity7 pushes back hard at @entity21 , but it does *n't* seem to be going away
