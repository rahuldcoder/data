@entity3 - funded weapons have begun flowing to @entity5 rebels , a @entity1 official told @entity6			1
but opposition groups say they have yet to receive any			1
the official confirmed details first reported by the @entity9 but would not speak publicly			2
" that is something we are not going to dispute , but we are not going to publicly speak to it , " the official said			2
the weapons are not @entity1 - made , but are funded and organized by the @entity3			1
they started to reach rebels about two weeks ago , the official said			1
the artillery was described as light weapons , some anti-tank weapons and ammunition			2
the @entity21 and the @entity22 deny they have received weapons from the @entity1			1
" we have some promises from the @entity1 administration of shipment of weapons in a short period of time , but until now we have not received any , " said @entity24 and @entity25			1
" we have logistical help , but we did n't get weapons until now			0
we hope that in the next short period of time we will start receiving weapons , because we have promises from @entity36 countries and the @entity1 that they will help us and support us			1
" the supply is in addition to the non-lethal aid that the @entity1 has been providing the rebels since april , when the @entity42 administration first altered the nature of the aid to include items such as body armor , night vision goggles and other military equipment			1
the official insisted the effort has been in the works for some time , and did not start as an effort to appease those calling for more rebel aid during the new diplomatic initiative with @entity56			2
@entity57 hints at transfer secretary of state @entity57 said tuesday during a @entity60 discussion that " many of the items that people complained were not getting to them are now getting to them			0
" he did not elaborate on specifics			0
a spokeswoman for the @entity68 declined comment			0
" we are n't able to inventory or provide timelines for every type of assistance we provide to the @entity5 opposition , " spokeswoman @entity70 said			0
@entity6 could not reach members of the rebel forces early thursday morning			2
@entity79 approved supply the supply of weapons was approved by @entity79 after the @entity42 administration asserted the regime of @entity5 president @entity85 had used chemical weapons on a small scale			0
but no progress toward physically supplying the rebels had been reported since then			0
" some things have not been getting to the opposition as rapidly as one would have hoped , " @entity57 said tuesday			0
@entity6 first reported on the plan to arm @entity5 rebels with small arms and ammunition in june , but officials refused to lay out a time line on delivery			0
@entity42 's national security team and members of @entity79 have repeatedly urged the president to increase direct aid for the rebels			0
they argue such a step would strengthen the hand of moderate members of the @entity5 opposition , and make them less reliant on well - armed extremist elements within their ranks			0
other developments the latest developments come on the eve of new diplomatic negotiations between the @entity1 and @entity56 , which begin thursday in @entity115 , @entity116			2
secretary @entity57 will meet with @entity56 foreign minister @entity117 for two days to discuss a @entity119 proposal to avert a @entity1 - led strike in @entity5 by having the @entity5 government put its chemical weapons stockpile under international control			1
but as @entity56 continues to supply @entity85 's regime with weapons while the @entity1 supplies the rebels , and @entity128 writes a piece in the @entity130 questioning the authority of @entity42 's call for military strikes , the baggage being brought to the negotiation table continues to pile up before talks have even begun .			1
