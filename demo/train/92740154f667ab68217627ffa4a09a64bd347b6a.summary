editor 's note : @entity2 anchors @entity3 's " @entity2 : @entity4 " at 8 p.m. et mondays through fridays			1
she delivered this commentary during the " @entity9 " segment of monday night 's broadcast			2
@entity2 says whoever wins should enter the @entity12 with his dignity intact			1
@entity14 ( @entity3 ) -- by now you 've probably heard about how ugly things have gotten out there on the campaign trail in the last 48 hours			1
but we thought for just a moment we would take you back to kinder , gentler times			2
remember this : sen. @entity23 : i pledge again a respectful campaign			1
a respectful campaign based on the issues and based on the stark differences we have on the vision for the future of @entity32			1
sen. @entity33 : i said i was looking forward to a civil substantive debate on the issues and he agreed			2
@entity23 : i 've pledged to conduct a respectful campaign and i urge , time after time , various entities within the @entity40 party to also do that			1
@entity33 : we do n't need @entity23 and @entity43 to be demonizing each other			2
you wo n't get that from my campaign			1
oh how far we have come in such a short period of time			0
to say , as gov. @entity50 is now doing , that @entity33 pals around with terrorists is just outrageous			0
but @entity33 's hands are n't clean either			0
here is what he said in may of this year about @entity23 's involvement in the @entity57 , a savings and loan scandal that happened in the late 80s			0
ireport.com : your hopes for next debate @entity33 said , " i do n't think there is any doubt that @entity23 's public record about issues that he 's apologized for and written about is not germane to the presidency			0
" and yet this morning the @entity33 campaign released a mini-documentary , walking voters through all the details of the @entity57 -- making it very much germane			1
there is just one month left			0
please , please do n't let this devolve into a campaign you are sickened by and embarrassed to be part of			1
here 's a purely practical reason : the negativity you are spewing now will only make your job harder after @entity81			0
bipartisanship is really tough to achieve when everyone on both sides is left with a bad bad taste in their mouths			0
here is the new @entity89 when asked " how are things going in the country today ? " 80 percent said badly			0
pollsters have been asking that question since 1974			0
eighty percent is an all - time low			0
people want to hear solutions from you			1
they want to hear how you are going to get us out of this mess			1
one of you will have to			0
do n't you want to be able to walk into the @entity12 with your dignity intact and your head held high ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .			2
