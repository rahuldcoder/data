@entity0 add @entity2 to the list of @entity5 power players uneasy about the prospect of another @entity8 bid for the @entity9			2
the corridors of high finance were the target of intense hostility during @entity8 's last presidential run			0
president @entity16 's campaign successfully seized on the former @entity19 governor 's time at private equity firm @entity20 to paint a picture of an industry that destroys middle - class jobs while wealthy executives reap generous profits -- often taxed at lower rates			1
financial executives remember the attacks in 2012 all too well and , faced with the possibility of another @entity8 campaign , are wary of another round of negative attention			2
" his formal entry will shine brighter light on some of the issues in the industry that people in the industry would rather not have a bright light on , " said @entity33 , managing director of the @entity0 - based private equity firm @entity34			1
@entity8 told supporters friday he wo n't embark on another campaign			0
the @entity45 , a @entity46 trade group that spearheaded a campaign in 2012 to improve understanding about the industry , stood ready to beat back criticism if @entity8 went back on the campaign trail			1
@entity45 is " prepared to engage and counter any mischaracterizations and attacks from the right or the left that could undermine the reputation of the private equity industry , " @entity52 , the group 's vice president of public affairs , said in an email before @entity8 's friday announcement			1
@entity8 faced widespread skepticism from plenty of fellow republicans who questioned his conservatism and ability to bond with voters			0
everyone from @entity72 chief @entity71 to rank - and - file @entity5 members of @entity73 threw cold water on the idea of a third @entity8 campaign			0
that would have made make finance -- where @entity8 spent decades of his professional life -- even more important as he sought political and financial support			0
in a sign of the industry 's significance , @entity8 made one of his first significant public acknowledgments that he is seriously considering another campaign to @entity5 donors in @entity0 this month			0
if @entity8 ran again , the spotlight would have again shone most brightly on the private equity sector , which acquires companies and restructures them with the end goal of turning a profit			1
@entity93 , a private equity investor who has done business with the former governor , said one of the biggest challenges in 2012 was to get the media to portray fairly the kind of work that @entity103 does and the range of organizations , such as pension funds and endowments , the industry supports			1
" it really felt like it was not in the interest by the press to get out -- to really explain what the idiosyncrasies are and benefits are to private equity , " @entity93 said , adding that there 's a prevailing sense among @entity103 executives that it 's " a waste to go forward trying to defend the industry			1
" but there 's no sign that the climate for @entity8 has improved since 2012			2
the wealth he accumulated during his years as a @entity103 executive will still be scrutinized , as issues like income inequality and raising the minimum wage have become even more politically potent			0
the midterm elections in november demonstrated that private equity -- which had already become a better - known household phrase thanks to the 2012 elections -- remains a rich target for criticism			1
in several key statewide races across the country , politicians with @entity103 backgrounds , including gubernatorial candidates @entity137 in @entity138 and @entity139 in @entity140 , were targeted by their opponents for their work in private equity as well as their massive wealth			2
rauner won his race , while @entity139 and other @entity103 candidates , such as @entity151 hopeful @entity150 in @entity152 , were defeated			0
" his opponent basically trashed the hell out of him and trashed the hell out of the fact that ... companies that he invested in killed old people or something like that , " said @entity157 , @entity16 's former chief of staff , who served as an adviser on @entity137 's transition team			0
" those sort of stories are tailor - made out of the private equity industry			2

private equity could be back in the spotlight if @entity8 runs for president
