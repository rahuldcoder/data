@entity0 was the first @entity1 leader to leave @entity2			2
the @entity5 president 's jet lifted off soon as soon as possible -- after the final lunch of the summit meeting , but well before the final communique outlining the achievements of the summit had been announced			1
given the mood of the summit , his speedy exit was hardly surprising			0

@entity31 prime minister @entity30 greeted the @entity5 leader the next day with the words : " i guess i 'll shake your hand but i 'll only have one thing to say to you -- get out of @entity20			1
" @entity38 leaders , led by @entity40 's @entity39 also had words for @entity0 , as did @entity43 president @entity42			2
but @entity0 put on a happy face when he met @entity29 in front of the cameras on saturday , despite the @entity49 leader 's comments only a few days previously -- accusing him , in person , of trying to " relive past glories of the @entity52 " in @entity53 at the @entity55 summit a few days earlier			1
the @entity5 leader looked isolated throughout the @entity2 meetings , but he was n't the only leader to have a tough @entity1			0

it began badly with his first comments to the cameras , as he sat with all @entity1 leaders at a private retreat			0
instead of concentrating on the big global picture , the @entity49 prime minister chose to tell the most powerful leaders in the world about his own problems on the domestic front , including the difficulties of getting @entity49 to spend $ 7 in fees when they visited the doctor			1
as one delegate said later , imagine having to translate that to the @entity79 leader at the meeting			0

" carbon mis - step @entity29 also pointed to his success in scrapping @entity49 's carbon tax			2
both the @entity43 and @entity91 presidents had just days earlier announced sweeping new carbon emission cuts to general praise around the world			1
@entity29 was on the wrong side of the carbon debate throughout the summit , with his government trying to keep it off the official agenda , arguing that the main purpose of the meeting was economics			0

some commentators are suggesting it could be the beginning of a de-escalation of tensions between @entity91 and @entity138 over territorial disputes in the @entity144			0
and it 's not over yet for the @entity91 leader , who is staying in @entity49 for the time being			2
