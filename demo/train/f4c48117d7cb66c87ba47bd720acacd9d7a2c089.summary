-- it will be @entity2 as nobody has seen it before			1
over six weeks next spring , @entity6 's @entity5 will present all 37 of the @entity2 's plays in 37 languages , performed by companies from as many countries			1
theater groups from the newly independent nation of @entity13 and conflict - torn @entity14 , as well as the @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 will be among those taking part			1
one play , @entity25 , will be performed entirely in @entity26 ( @entity26 ) , used by the deaf community , while the @entity28 from @entity29 will stage @entity30 in hip hop			0
@entity32 , festival director for the @entity5 to @entity5 event -- which will run from april to june as part of the " cultural olympiad " ahead of the @entity37 -- told @entity0 it was the most ambitious project of its kind			1
between a third and a half of the plays to be staged had already been adapted into the various languages , but the festival 's organizers also traveled widely looking for talented theater groups to create new adaptations			1
they were " completely bowled over " by the enthusiasm shown for the project by countries around the world , he said , and had to make some difficult decisions about who would make the cut			0
" the tricky thing is we ca n't get everyone in , so we thought a little bit about the languages that are spoken in @entity6 , like @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 , " @entity32 said			2
" we also looked at countries that have a great long history of performing @entity2 , like @entity65 and @entity66 , and finally if there was a very good show , we could take that anyway			2
" some of the groups chosen to take part face " incredible obstacles that no @entity75 or @entity76 theater company would have to put up , " he said			2
the actors from @entity14 had been rehearsing in the @entity79 compound in the capital , @entity81 , that was attacked last month , leaving eight people dead and twice as many injured			0
" luckily they were n't there on that day , but it was really a very , very lucky miss , " @entity32 said			0
the @entity14 actors can not currently get visas for @entity88 in @entity81 , so will have to rehearse @entity89 in @entity90 and then travel to @entity6 from there , he said			1
acting involving both men and women , the latter not always covering their heads , also presents a cultural challenge , he added			0
the theater company from @entity13 gave its first performance at independence day celebrations this summer , as the new nation emerged from decades of civil conflict			2
the group will perform @entity102 in @entity103 , in what will be " a great moment in the history of the country , " @entity32 said			0
the three plays of @entity109 , about @entity111 's first great civil war of the 15th century , will be staged as a @entity15 trilogy by the national theaters of @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 , whose actors can draw on the region 's recent turbulent past			0
@entity5 to @entity5 's statement points to the @entity122 -- which will perform @entity123 -- as " the world 's bravest theater company " for its work , " which it does in spite of the threat of state persecution			1
" the @entity131 group @entity130 , from @entity132 , will present @entity133 in @entity134 , while the @entity136 national theater company @entity135 will perform @entity137 in @entity138			0
bird hopes the range of languages represented will bring a new audience to the @entity5 , a reproduction of the original @entity145 theater on the banks of the @entity147 in which @entity2 himself had a stake			1
an estimated 60,000 @entity151 speakers live in @entity6 's inner city @entity153 area , he said -- and the festival organizers hope many will want to see @entity157 performed in that tongue			1
some of the 130,000 @entity159 in @entity6 could also flock to the @entity5 to see @entity160 performed in @entity159 @entity161 by a troupe from @entity163			1
as for those theater enthusiasts who do n't speak a myriad of languages ? they wo n't find a line - by - line subtitling of each play , @entity32 said , but a synopsis will be provided so people can follow the gist of what is happening -- and performances will be limited to no more than two - and - a - quarter hours in length			2
audiences can also enjoy experiencing performance styles , costumes and music from the four corners of the world			0
" we want people to really listen to the language , even if they do n't understand it , " @entity32 said			0
" we hope they will enjoy hearing these familiar stories in an unfamiliar language			0
" tickets will be on sale to the public from october 17			0
the @entity5 starts april 23 , @entity2 's birthday .			1

@entity2 's plays will be presented in 37 different languages
