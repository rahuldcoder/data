@entity0 -- with races run , records set and a remarkable sporting infrastructure now in place , the @entity2 and @entity3 have confirmed the @entity10 capital 's reputation as one of the world 's great cities			1
the @entity3 will also have inspired millions across the globe to pursue sporting careers across a range of disciplines			2
but arguably @entity2 's legacy is more intangible			2
who would have thought gold medallists like @entity22 swimmer @entity21 , @entity24 @entity23 , @entity27 's double amputee @entity25 and @entity29 's @entity28 ( swimming ) , @entity31 ( athletics ) and @entity33 ( wheelchair racer ) would become household names across the world ? recording unprecedented crowds , with some two - and - a - half million tickets sold , the @entity10 got behind the @entity3 in a way that no other country has previously done and helped shift perceptions towards disability around the world as they did so			1
@entity44 newspaper in @entity25 ' home nation captured an emotion reverberating around the globe saying that the @entity3 have marked a watershed in the way the planet views disability			2
" the 2012 @entity3 will live long in the memory as the @entity3 where @entity27 and the world learnt that these @entity3 were not the fun games nor the ' shame ' games , " wrote @entity44			1
" @entity0 was where the athletes became professional , where they became elite and celebrated their elevation to a new status , " the newspaper added			0
it was a @entity3 where spectators finally started to focus on ability rather than disability , a request many @entity3 have always made			2
" i think people are going to look back at this @entity3 and for the first time really , truly believe that @entity3 sport is not just inspirational , it 's hard - core sport , " said @entity25			1
born with a congenital defect , @entity25 had both legs amputated below the knee when he was 11 months old			0
but the 25 - year - old has overcome his disability to such an extent that he became the first double amputee to compete at the @entity78 when running in @entity27 's 4x400m relay team this summer			0
the achievements of @entity82 's @entity81 have also helped change attitudes to @entity3 sport in @entity27			1
the wheelchair - bound javelin and shot put thrower was the women 's @entity88 winner in sunday 's @entity3 closing ceremony -- an award given to a male and a female athlete who exemplify the @entity3 spirit			0
" because of my success in field events , more women with disabilities in my community and in @entity82 have shown interest in sports , " @entity81 says			0
" @entity102 is spreading in my country and opens opportunities for people with disabilities and help change the perceptions towards people with disabilities in a positive way			0
" but it 's not just @entity27 where attitudes are changing			0
the @entity111 in @entity112 has been won over , crediting this year 's paralympics with providing a " fundamental change in the way much of the world looks at disability , " adding that the @entity3 " swiftly taught us to look beyond disability towards achievement			1
" thirty - two years after @entity121 refused to stage the @entity3 , the enthusiasm shown by the organizers , the @entity10 crowds and , of course , the athletes at this summer 's games has finally begun to convert the @entity129 public , says tabloid @entity130			1
" @entity129 are not used to encountering disabled people in the street ... yet for the first time , they discovered a previously unknown sporting world and its courageous fighters , " the paper said			1
even in @entity10 , attitudes have been changing			0
polls conducted during the @entity3 showing that eight out of 10 @entity10 adults thought the 2012 @entity3 had had a positive impact on the way disabled people are viewed by the public			1
this would be yet another triumph for the @entity2 organising committee whose chairman , @entity146 fervently believes that the @entity10 public will never view sport nor disability in the same way after this summer 's @entity3			1
" we set a goal to create awareness , " said @entity146 , the chairman of the @entity152			0
" i really think we have done that in helping converting some of those extraordinary talents into household names			0
i really genuinely think we have had a seismic effect in shifting public attitudes ( towards disability )			0
" on monday afternoon , the likes of @entity28 , @entity31 and @entity33 were joined by fellow @entity3 and @entity163 as crowds estimated to be in excess of one million thronged the streets of @entity0 to wave goodbye to what prime minister @entity167 called a " golden summer of @entity10 sport			1
" it officially ended on sunday as the @entity3 closing ceremony extinguished the flame in the @entity173 for the final time , before the @entity3 flag was handed to the mayor of @entity177 , the @entity24 city which will host both games in 2016			0
and if the legacy of @entity2 really proves to be a defining shift in the global attitude towards disability , then what on earth could @entity177 expect to achieve in four years time ?			2

@entity2 have produced *massive* crowds , memorable action and a *surprising* legacy
@entity3 has inspired many people around the world to think *differently* about disabled sport
newspapers in @entity27 , @entity129 and the @entity196 *praise* games for changing perceptions of disability
