and then there 's bigger			2
introducing @entity3 , set to be the world 's biggest superyacht at a whopping 222 meters ( 728 feet ) long			1
at $ 1 billion , it will also be the most expensive private yacht ever built , costing more than the annual gdp of @entity8 , the @entity9 , and @entity10			1
the identity of @entity3 's owner remains secret			1
nonetheless , building a yacht of this size is all about " boasting rights , " said @entity15 of @entity16 , broker of the record - breaking project			2
" it 's just like the competition to build the world 's tallest building , " he said of the commission , due to be completed in spring 2018			1
" @entity24 will cost $ 1.1 billion to $ 1.2 billion , " added @entity15			1
" and do n't forget to add in annual operating costs -- on a yacht of this size , it will run the owner up an additional $ 20 to $ 30 million per year			2
" the boat will be more than 131 feet ( 40 meters ) longer than the world 's current biggest superyacht , " @entity33 , " believed to be owned by the president of the @entity35 , @entity34			1
it will also trump @entity39 businessman @entity38 's " @entity37 " by 192 feet ( 58.5 meters )			1
" our client was concerned that if we built the yacht to 200 meters ( 656 feet ) , then someone would come along like @entity38 when he built @entity37 at 163.5 meters ( 536 feet ) , and outdid @entity45 's yacht , the 162 - meter ( 531 - foot ) @entity46 , by only 1.5 meters ( 5 feet ) , " explained @entity15			1
" by building the yacht to 222 meters ( 728 feet ) , the owner wants to make it difficult , if not impossible , to be ' eclipsed ' himself			1
" as the race to build the world 's biggest superyacht steps up a notch , is there a point when these floating palaces simply become " too big ? " " you ca n't really be ' too big ' for the high seas			1
but these superyachts are now at such a size that many of them ca n't get into harbors , " said @entity59 , author of " the @entity60 : from slaves to superyachts , a 2,000 year history			0
" " so what they do is moor out at sea , and a small boat -- which is still enormous by the standards of ordinary mortals -- will take them to shore			0
or they could always jump on their helicopter , because no self - respecting superyacht comes without a helipad these days			2
" in the past two decades average superyacht sizes have more than doubled , according to @entity81 , managing director of the @entity83			2
" fifteen years ago a large yacht was 45 meters ( 147 feet ) , " she said			1
" whereas now it 's 100 meters ( 328 feet ) long , maybe even a little more , " she said			1
" and i think we have still not achieved the limit			0
" @entity3 's master suite alone encompasses two stories and stretches across 275 square meters ( 275 square feet ) -- including a private gym			1
the seven - deck superyacht also comes with two pools , numerous jacuzzi , and a hair stylist and barber			2
yet in a global climate of " haves and have - nots , " is it morally justifiable to spend $ 1 billion on a private yacht catering for 36 guests ? " to be honest , what ordinary mortals think is ' moral , ' is not actually relevant to these people , " said @entity59			1
" you have to understand that we 're not talking about the top 1 % -- in this instance we 're talking about the 0.01 %			2
this is a tiny group who live in their own bubble , they mix only among themselves			0
" @entity15 sees things differently , pointing to the employment opportunities created during the building and running of the superyacht			0
" the boat will take approximately two to three million human hours to build -- not counting all the worldwide subcontractor hours , or the ready - made items already available on the market ready to be installed on the yacht , " he said			0
" building the yacht at the shipyard will directly employ , at the minimum , 500 people for a period of three years			0
these people , who have families to support and feed , will be gainfully employed			0
" and this does not include the 50 to 70 people who will work on the yacht and will be employed full time by the yacht owner , as well as others who supply the yacht			0
" he extends this reasoning to the media -- " you , the journalist , benefits from this build indirectly by being gainfully employed by @entity1 for writing this story			0
" and you , the person reading this story ? @entity147 sees the public 's interest in the lifestyles of the super rich as a type of luxury porn			0
" there is an enormous sense of injustice which is shared not just by the poor , but also by the middle class , towards the global super rich , " he said			0
" but together with that however , is a sense of envy and ogling			0
so whether you call it confusion , or double standards , or hypocrisy , or whatever it might be -- we both abhor the lifestyles of the super rich and at the same time we are endlessly fascinated by them			0
