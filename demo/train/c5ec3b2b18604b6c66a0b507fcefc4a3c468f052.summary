-- in october 1985 , the @entity2 circus arrived in @entity3 to race at @entity4			1
apartheid -- which had put an end to almost all other sporting events in the country -- did n't deter @entity2 , even if both the @entity10 and @entity11 teams refused to race			1
@entity12 removed its sponsorship from the @entity15 cars of @entity16 and @entity17 , and various governments tried to stop their drivers racing			0
sound familiar ? although @entity3 during apartheid and @entity22 now are two completely different political situations , you ca n't help but wonder whether @entity2 has moved on at all in the last 27 years			1
the view of @entity26 's chief @entity25 that the elite division of motorsport does n't do politics seems somewhat out of kilter			1
the civil unrest in @entity22 -- and the political implications of @entity2 racing there -- has led to @entity35 politicians asking for the race to be canceled			1
on april 13 the sport 's governing body -- the @entity37 -- announced that the race would go ahead despite continuing conflict between @entity42 protesters and the @entity44 government			1
the decision was met with shock from @entity2 fans around the world			1
" imagine we said , ' no way are we going , ' - would the problems stop ? " @entity25 told the @entity52 at last weekend 's @entity53			1
" the answer is no because they are not protesting about @entity2 and that 's why we are going to @entity22			1
" @entity25 -- never one to kowtow to convention -- may have missed the @entity42 protesters carrying toy machine guns and wearing motor racing overalls			0
he may also have missed the banner reading " stop racing on our blood " and the government 's " @entity66 " campaign			2
no , there is not political unrest because of @entity2 , but the sport is being used as a political tool and could be used as a stage upon which to be heard			1
ask any @entity2 sponsor why they are in the sport and they will tell you about the amazing global platform that it provides			1
the same argument , understandably , applies to protesters who want to make a point			0
" i do n't see lots of protests throughout the country , " economist and former @entity22 politician @entity80 told the @entity35 @entity82			2
" but yes , the fear is there that we could see some casualties			0
so it 's now a challenge for the security forces who have to handle things properly			2
they should avoid using force			0
" in a press conference on friday , @entity22 's crown prince salman bin @entity97 expressed his reasoning behind the race going ahead			1
" i think canceling just empowers extremists , " he said			0
" i think for those of us that are trying to navigate a way out of this political problem , having a race allows us to build bridges across communities and get people working together			2
" three - time @entity2 world champion @entity111 is a firm believer that sport can unite people			1
that may be so , but only if the sport in question is neutral			0
@entity2 most certainly is n't in this case			1
the @entity22 government not only owns the @entity120 track , but it also invested millions to build the circuit before the first race there in 2004			0
it also owns a stake in @entity35 's @entity15 , one of the participating teams , so it 's clear why many @entity42 protesters are so against the event taking place			2
the @entity37 has had people in @entity22 monitoring the situation for some time now , and the teams and drivers have said that they trust its decision to race in the @entity138 kingdom , even if some teams have taken extra security with them			2
but , with four @entity143 team members being close to a petrol bomb after leaving the track on thursday , it 's clear that the extra security is not enough			0
indeed , two members of the team have since requested to return home			0
there are also reports that a @entity151 employee has quit over the situation			0
of course , nowhere is safe -- a mad priest managed to run onto the track during the @entity155 -- but surely a sport should not be competing in a country where its participants are anywhere near a petrol bomb ? the safety of the teams and the island 's citizens should be put before a sporting event			1
" it is obviously not right that this sort of stuff happens , " @entity143 driver @entity166 told reporters on thursday			0
" we are here to race			0
the @entity2 business is about entertainment , and these sort of things should not really be happening to us			2
whether it is right or not i do n't really know			0
i am not a politician , i am a @entity2 driver			2
" other drivers have remained quiet -- and very neutral -- on the subject			0
as many will remember , the @entity180 was at first postponed and then canceled due to riots and the much - publicized " @entity183 " on february 14			1
so what has changed this year ? and why is @entity2 able to race ? last year the @entity35 foreign office raised its evaluation of the threat level in the country and with that came insurance problems for the teams			1
there was pressure from the @entity37 and @entity26 to cancel the race , which the @entity22 government duly did			0
by doing so it missed out on an estimated $ 480 - 800 million of investment that would have come from hosting it			0
the race looks as though it will go ahead and , with the circuit being based in the desert , it should be easier than some to keep secure			0
however , if something does go wrong then it is going to be extremely hard for @entity2 to recover its integrity			1
the @entity207 was canceled immediately after that 1985 race by the @entity37 's then - president @entity209			1
it did n't return until 1992 , once apartheid had ended			0
@entity2 did learn from its mistakes all those years ago , even if it was too late for many			2
the fact that it seems to have forgotten that lesson now is baffling many fans around the world			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity219 .			2

*sunday* 's @entity221 will take place amid a *backdrop* of *anti-government* protests
the @entity2 race was canceled last year due to a civil *uprising* in the @entity229 island
the situation *mirrors* what happened in 1985 with a race in apartheid - era @entity3
@entity219 : @entity2 chief is wrong when he says that sport and politics do not mix
