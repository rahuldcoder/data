@entity0 -- the shooting death of a @entity0 shopkeeper friday is raising the possibility of a three - time killer on the loose , police said			1
a .22 - caliber handgun is the link			2
" the same gun was used in all three murders , " said deputy commissioner @entity9			1
but police are stopping short of calling the multiple deaths the work of a serial killer			1
" it 's too soon to tell , " @entity16 said			0
" there are similar things in each case , but that determination has n't been made yet			0
" ballistics tests on shell casings found at the crime scene indicate the .22 - caliber gun used in the slaying of @entity27 , 78 , at his clothing store in @entity30 last week is the same weapon used since july in the killings of two other small business owners , also in @entity30			1
" that does n't say it 's the same person who fired the gun , but that 's the working premise , that it 's the same shooter , " @entity16 told @entity1			1
@entity27 was shot three times in the head and torso and killed inside his women 's clothing store called , she - she boutique , according to police			1
police said sunday they wanted to talk with four " unknown individuals " seen on videotapes from security cameras in the area of the store between the time @entity27 was last known to be alive and the time his body was found			1
" detectives want to question them about what they may have observed because of the time of day and their proximity to the homicide scene , " a police statement said			2
forensic tests show the same weapon was used in the august 3 shooting death of @entity62 , 59 , who was killed in his store , amazing 99 @entity64			2
police said he was shot in the head			1
on july 6 , @entity69 , 65 , was gunned down in his clothing shop , @entity71 besides being shot in the head , police said @entity69 was also stabbed in the neck			1
there are distinct similarities in the way the victims were positioned after their deaths			0
law enforcement sources said each victim 's body was pulled away from the stores ' front windows and either covered by clothes or hidden by merchandise			0
" it 's consistent with hiding anything from immediate view of the street , so that it 's not seen from someone passing by right away , " said one source			0
" it may have been done to give the killer more time to make ( his ) getaway , " added another police source			2
@entity16 said all three victims have ties to the @entity100 , but for now , investigators are n't drawing any conclusions			0
" there 's nothing to suggest a bias , " @entity16 told @entity1			0
however , a task force set up to help solve the first two slayings has now been expanded to add someone from the hate crimes task force , @entity16 added			2
" some of the victims had an @entity112 or @entity113 background , one was @entity114 , but there was no one religion or ethnicity , although that might not be obvious to the killer , " @entity16 said			0
some money was taken in the first two killings , raising the possibility of violent robberies			0
however , investigators said it 's not yet clear in the most recent killing whether @entity27 's store had any money missing			1
" we 're still trying to determine that , " @entity16 said			0
the @entity131 's website defines serial killers as " three or more killings ... having common characteristics such as to suggest the reasonable possibility that the crimes were committed by the same actor or actors			0
" however , @entity139 , a former deputy chief in the @entity30 district attorney 's office who helped prosecute the " @entity143 " case in the ' 70s agrees with the @entity145 's hesitation to label the three shopkeepers ' deaths as serial killings at this stage			1
enough is n't known , according to @entity139 , who is also a @entity1 legal analyst			0
" police will resist that characterization because they will be fearful that high publicity will alert the killer and impede the investigation , " @entity139 said .			2

three @entity30 shopkeepers have been shot and killed since july
the most recent killing occurred friday
