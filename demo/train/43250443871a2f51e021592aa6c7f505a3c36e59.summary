-- @entity1 , one of the seminal political figures of the 20th century , will be remembered for her unswerving belief in the virtues of free market capitalism and the vices of socialism , and for her role in the downfall of communism			1
people might wonder why @entity1 evokes such positive emotion from young conservatives , such as me , who were children during her heyday			2
in our era of politics in which spin seems to take precedence to substance , @entity1 was an icon for what politics should be about -- courage , spirit and the determination to change things for the better			2
in pursuit of the defeat of what she saw as socialist totalitarianism , she made a close alliance with @entity37 president @entity36 and built a relationship with @entity40 leader @entity39 , while still standing firm in opposition to the @entity40 empire			2
without question , she was one of @entity37 's closest and most important friends and was instrumental in winning the @entity46 for the @entity47			1
opinion : how ' @entity1 ' built transatlantic bridges she refused to be bowed by terrorism and stood against it in all its forms			1
after the @entity55 attempted to assassinate her and her cabinet at the @entity57 in @entity58 , narrowly missing @entity1 but killing five people , she insisted on continuing the conference the next day			2
" the fact that we are gathered here now , shocked , but composed and determined , is a sign not only that this attack has failed , but that all attempts to destroy democracy by terrorism will fail			0
" her courage brought moral clarity in highlighting the atrocity of terrorism as a means of political activity			0
her resolve to stand against any threat to @entity77 interests was clear in the @entity78			1
after the invasion of @entity77 territory by @entity82 military forces , @entity1 said it would not stand			1
fully knowing the real prospect of defeat , @entity1 ordered a @entity77 military task force to re-take the islands			1
along with foreign policy successes , @entity1 , known as " @entity90 , " scored domestically			0
facing high unemployment rates , a crippling union stranglehold and an unproductive , stagnating economy , the @entity77 of the 1970s was a country in dire straits			2
@entity1 believed that pervasive unemployment and growing inflation were not just temporary threats , they were burying @entity77 's future			1
she believed the root causes were found not in the shifts of economic cycles , but in the failure of @entity77 's flawed economic model			0
opinion : why @entity1 made so many enemies she guided @entity77 's economic base away from domestic monopolies and toward global capitalism			1
because of her privatization and deregulation policies , the @entity77 became a center for international finance and investment			1
in 1987 , @entity1 was elected to a historic third term			0
despite her successes politically , she was a polarizing presence and had relatively low approval ratings during her tenure			0
many @entity77 detested her attempts to curb the unions , her cuts to social programs and education , and her introduction of the @entity130 , called the " poll tax			2
" her @entity132 did not share her views on the @entity134			0
she resigned as prime minister after three terms in 1990 , believing her party had betrayed her			0
still , there can be no debate of her enduring impact			0
@entity145 's historic 1997 election and return of the @entity143 to power is often pointed to as a moment of renewed liberalism in @entity77			0
in many ways , it was			0
but under the banner of a new @entity143 and @entity145 's embrace of a " third way , " it is also evident that @entity1 had changed @entity77 's economic debate forever			1
she had moved the political discussion from one of statism versus capitalism to a basic acceptance of free market economics as a standard of @entity77 political consensus			0
opinion : why @entity77 needs another @entity1 although many on the @entity77 left oppose what @entity1 did and what she stood for , there is a quiet , begrudging perhaps , but unmistakable admiration of her strong and unswerving leadership			1
history will record @entity1 stood for what she believed , and that both @entity77 and the world are better for it			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity178 .			0
