@entity0 , @entity1 -- several decades ago , @entity3 nearly died when a horse kicked him in the head			1
he was in the middle of the @entity8 rain forest , not exactly the easiest spot to find a doctor			0
" there was no medical care there , ( and ) i was 350 miles from the nearest doctor , " said @entity3 , who was working for a cattle ranch on an open range that spanned @entity13 and what is now @entity15			1
fortunately , he was able to recover on his own after more than a month			0
but many other people in the region were n't as lucky			2
" when you got things like measles , influenza and malaria , " @entity3 said , " it was just absolutely devastating			1
... millions of people disappeared			2
" @entity3 saw this devastation firsthand while he lived among indigenous tribes			1
after his near - fatal injury , he realized that something had to be done			0
" it kind of jarred my thinking into , ' hey , let 's bring these doctors a little bit closer than 26 days on foot , ' " he said			0
@entity3 took the initiative , getting his pilot 's license and a small plane to bring medical care to the people that he worked with -- and even the animals for which he cared			1
" instead of taking weeks and weeks to get into that place , the airplane could get there in just a few hours , " he said			0
" ( if ) somebody was badly hurt or injured , we could put them in the back of the airplane and take them somewhere " for care			2
in 1985 , decades after he first started flying , @entity3 went the extra step and started a nonprofit , @entity58			1
since then , the all - volunteer group has held more than 660 medical clinics worldwide , providing free health care to half a million people			1
" ( these ) are not the people that can afford to go down the road and pay $ 300 , $ 400 , $ 500 for an eye exam and a pair of glasses , or sometimes thousands of dollars to get their teeth fixed , " said @entity3 , 75			1
" the patients ... are so grateful for what we 're able to do for them			0
" from dropout to ' @entity76 ' @entity3 's life reads something like a movie script			1
when he dropped out of school at 16 , he followed his parents from @entity82 to what was then @entity84 , where he got a job herding cattle			0
there , he learned the local language and sometimes went days without food and water			0
@entity3 's forte was the lasso , and he was eventually discovered and brought on as a co-host of @entity94 's " @entity76 , " an educational television series that aired in the 1960s , ' 70s and ' 80s			1
( see him challenge a buffalo on @entity99 ) today , @entity3 said , people still come up to him and say " i grew up watching you on ' @entity76 ' " or " i became a wildlife biologist or a marine biologist because of watching you on ' @entity76			1
' " but even though his new job made him well - known and allowed him to travel all over the world , he never forgot where he came from			1
" i understand what it 's like to be penniless , homeless and uninsured , " @entity3 said , referring to his cowboy roots			1
his nonprofit started as a strictly overseas venture , helping the needy in hard - to - reach places			2
volunteers would fly into remote regions , sometimes parachuting in , to aid people who did n't have access to medical care			1
@entity3 says it was n't long , however , before he started to get requests for aid in the @entity123			1
the first request came in 1992 from @entity125 , a small , rural area in @entity126			0
the local hospital had closed , and its only dentist had just left			0
" we went up to @entity125 , and there were 100 to 150 people wanting their teeth fixed , " said @entity3			1
" we took care of them , ( and ) it was n't more than another week before i got the same request from the next county over			2
" soon , @entity3 said , they were so busy in the @entity123 that the group had to cut back on overseas commitments to meet obligations at home			1
professionals filling a need -- on their own dime more than 70,000 people have donated their time and expertise to @entity3 's cause over the years			1
many are full - time doctors and nurses who work at their own practices or hospitals during the week and then volunteer on the weekend			0
@entity58 , or @entity154 , runs about 25 clinics a year , serving hundreds of patients at a time			2
" it always has been a very much volunteer effort , not only in terms of physical contributions , but in their financial contributions , " @entity3 said			1
" all these people , they 're buying their own hotel and paying their own travel expenses to get here			2
" medical supplies for the clinics are often donated , while @entity58 has purchased much of its larger equipment over the years			0
last month , @entity3 piloted a single - engine , turbo - prop airplane to @entity1 , carrying 20 dental chairs and other supplies for @entity58 's 663rd mission			1
the clinic , held in @entity0 , offered free eye exams along with glaucoma testing			2
patients could receive prescription glasses that were made on site			2
dental extractions , cleanings and fillings were also available , and medical services included pap smears , breast exams , acupuncture and testing for diabetes and @entity188			0
a day before the clinic opened , lines began forming outside the city 's coliseum			0
@entity193 , 45 , arrived the night before , sleeping in a tent along with three other people			2
she had recently found four lumps in her breasts , and without a job or health insurance , she did n't know where else to go			2
a nurse and doctor conducted two breast exams on @entity204 and found the lumps to be benign cysts			0
" i felt so relieved , " she said			0
" i 'm not living in fear anymore			0
it was a big monkey off my back			0
" the medical services offered at each clinic vary and are based on the specialties of the doctors volunteering			0
but @entity3 said most people -- as many as 85 % of the people on a clinic 's first day -- are there to see a dentist or an eye doctor			1
that 's usually because some insurance plans do not cover dental or vision care , and many patients can not afford to purchase new eyeglasses			2
@entity3 said there are plans to expand @entity123 operations for his group , and he also wants to add a permanent clinic in @entity15 and start up a program in @entity233			1
" this is a 365 - day - a - year operation , " @entity3 said			1
he sleeps at @entity58 headquarters , a ramshackle schoolhouse in rural @entity126 , and he takes no income for his work			0
he does n't drive a car and -- other than a bicycle and some odds and ends -- he has no assets			0
" i guess i 'm your basic indigent ceo , " he laughs			0
he is also humble , quick to deflect praise to the volunteers who have helped him through the years			0
" it 's those people that are making all of these patients either pain - free or more functional and better , " he said			1
" they 're the heroes			0
all i do is show up and carry some of the luggage			2
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity58 website at @entity253 and see how to help .			0

@entity3 made a name for himself lassoing animals on ' @entity76 '
today , he runs a nonprofit that provides free health care to people all over the world
