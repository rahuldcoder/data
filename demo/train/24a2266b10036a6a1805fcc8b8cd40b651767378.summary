-- i glanced at the map display on my side of the passenger jet 's instrument panel			1
a small blue circle within 100 miles of the magenta line that defined our course identified the airport in @entity11 , @entity12			0
this would be our best alternate if our medical problem became an emergency			0
we were just shy of two hours into our flight from @entity18 to @entity19 when the flight attendant call chime sounded and i picked up the intercom handset			2
a woman in business class had fainted and was vomiting			0
a retired physician was attending			0
the flight attendant promised to keep me updated			2
with the handset still to my ear , i contemplated the situation and asked , " has anyone determined whether the woman has a fever ? " silence			2
no. good question , " the flight attendant said			2
a couple of months ago this would have been a matter of deciding whether we needed a diversionary landing			0
but this trip was flown just last weekend , and at a time of rampant @entity42 paranoia			1
fortunately , the story had a happy ending for all concerned			0
the woman had apparently overmedicated herself before the flight , and had mostly recovered by the time we parked at our arrival gate at @entity49			2
even so , i conveyed the details to our dispatcher while en route , and every step we took was cautious			0
passengers were not allowed to deplane until a determination was made as to the status of the ill passenger			1
our flight attendants , exhibiting their professionalism , followed the appropriate medical protocols , accessing the in - flight medical kit , and our " grab and go " kit , which contains items such as latex gloves and clothing to protect responders from contagious bodily fluids			2
a recent article in the @entity71 detailed how @entity42 paranoia has indeed permeated the cockpit			1
apparently , few pilots are willing to fly @entity42 patients out of the hot zones for treatment ; one director of an air ambulance service said he knew of only two such pilots in all of @entity81			1
these pilots work for air ambulance or med - evac companies , flying mostly corporate - type jets			2
compared with an airliner , these airplanes have more confined cabins and cockpits			0
pilots are a skeptical bunch			2
when there is room for doubt , we do n't necessarily believe the information provided by , say , health officials on subject matters outside our field of expertise			2
we deal in a world of black and white , where training prepares one to handle contingencies			0
our personalities lean toward the control freak side of the scale			0
controlling an engine fire is a systematic procedure practiced on almost every recurrent training cycle			0
controlling a deadly disease is out of our realm and out of our comfort zone			1
but pilots are also reasonable			0
if someone wants us to fly @entity42 patients , education and training first would be paramount			1
credibility is important : involve a respected medical professional in the education process and you will have a pilot 's attention			0
be honest about the risk for cockpit crews , especially if they will have frequent contact with symptomatic patients			1
a pilot procedure for the transportation of @entity42 patients has to be determined right down to the movements and position of the crew , from takeoff to landing			1
should crews be required to wear protective clothing ? masks ? goggles ? be doused with chlorine ? remain quarantined for 21 days after each evac trip ? once the standard procedure has been established , then contingencies need to be considered in the event of an in - flight emergency , whether it be mechanical or with the ill patient			1
in other words , give pilots a checklist to follow -- they are a pilot 's bible			1
they do n't cover every circumstance , but they provide a structured guideline			0
and finally , the air ambulance companies that contract to provide @entity42 patient transportation need to compensate their pilots appropriately for the risk			1
more importantly , it must be mandatory to provide medical treatment if the worst occurs and @entity42 infects an employee			1
the company must accept both the medical and financial responsibility			0
regardless , air transportation employees , flying for hours in a cylinder with an infectious patient , are at risk more than the general public			0
until more is understood about the source and initial containment of this dangerous disease , most likely my air ambulance colleagues will maintain their apprehensions , and just say " no. " as for @entity182 airlines , the procedures in dealing with the @entity42 risk are left to the individual carrier , and the @entity184 has provided guidance via a linked website			1
it 's more or less common sense , with most of the information educational for managing a potentially infected passenger once airborne			0
the website also covers the legality of denying boarding to passengers with serious contagious diseases : " @entity182 @entity195 rule permits airlines to deny boarding to air travelers with serious contagious diseases that could spread during flight , including travelers with possible @entity42 symptoms			1
" of course airline personnel would need to know about such an affliction before they could deny a passenger boarding			0
it 's a life and death detail , and one that has been -- and will continue to be -- a deal - breaker for most pilots during a time of @entity42			1
but for the crews involved directly with @entity42 patient transportation , it is still pilots beware .			1

@entity214 : with ill passenger on recent flight , learning if there was fever was *key* in @entity42 times
there was n't , but it *illustrates* fears of pilots ; only a handful agree to transport @entity42 patients
pilots need prep , checklists . controlling deadly disease out of comfort zone , he says
@entity235 : airlines must compensate for such risk -- but pilots likely to balk anyway
