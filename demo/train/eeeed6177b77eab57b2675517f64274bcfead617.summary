though these days , our fascination with witchcraft takes on a more benign form ( nothing a @entity12 all - night @entity11 ca n't cure ) , there once was a time when the mere mention of sorcery led entire towns to burn , drown , crush and flay those individuals believed in possession of magical powers			2
though it may seem witches have since been relegated to the history books and costume shops , there are still many places in the world that treat magic as serious business , no matter the time of year			0

religious fervor played a strong role , as the @entity104 @entity103 i was eager to rout out both witches and @entity106 -- often associated as one and the same			0
the impoverished did n't fare much better			0
" the poor often sold natural remedies from local plants and herbs , which local authorities often viewed as ' spells ' , and hence demonic , " explains @entity109 , tourism team leader for @entity110 and @entity111			2
