of @entity5 ' @entity4 , the mysterious boss of the terror group that is striking fear into the hearts of leaders around the world			1
in the past couple of years you 've managed to avoid drone attacks and survive civil wars , unify militant groups in two different countries under your banner , raise an army of jihadis from across the globe , and seize a chunk of land stretching from northern @entity22 to central @entity23			1
your newly - declared " @entity26 " is the size of @entity25 , so how do you govern it ? you compartmentalize			2
new data from the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) has revealed that @entity5 is putting governing structures in place to rule the territories the group conquers once the dust settles on the battlefield			1
the research shows how @entity5 has gone from being a purely military force to building a system that can provide basic services , such as making sure that gas and food are available , to its new citizens			1
from the cabinet and the governors to the financial and legislative bodies , @entity5 ' bureaucratic hierarchy looks a lot like those of some of the @entity50 countries whose values it rejects -- if you take away the democracy and add in a council to consider who should be beheaded			2
@entity57 , his @entity59 advisers and his two key deputies comprise the executive branch of the government , known as " @entity64			1
" the two deputies -- @entity68 and @entity69 , veteran @entity23 military officials who served under @entity67 -- oversee @entity22 and @entity23 , respectively			1
@entity5 has probably split the governance of the " @entity26 " into @entity22 and @entity23 branches simply to make it easier to run , according to @entity73 , @entity28 's @entity74 director			1
" they see the caliphate as one state , yet there are two different governments , " @entity73 told @entity0			0
" i believe this split is purely administrative at this time			0
they do n't want to be seen as downplaying the caliphate , but to make it easier to govern they were forced to make a separation between @entity22 and @entity23			2
" the two deputies deliver orders to the governors in charge of the various sub-states in @entity22 and @entity23 under @entity5 control , who then instruct local councils on how to implement the executive branch 's decrees on everything from media relations and recruiting to policing and financial matters			1
the shura council -- which reports directly to the executive branch -- is the caliphate 's religious monitor , appointed to make sure that all the local councils and governors are sticking to @entity5 ' version of @entity107 law			2
the recent murders of @entity50 hostages @entity110 , @entity111 , and @entity112 would have fallen under the shura council 's purview , according to @entity73			0
" let 's say a significant execution is going to take place , something that will get @entity5 on the front page of the newspaper , " @entity73 said			2
" it can not be done without shura council approval			0
" the shura council also has the power to censure the leadership for running afoul of its interpretation of @entity129 law , according to @entity73			0
" the shura council has the right to tell @entity57 to go if he 's not adhering to @entity5 ' religious standards , " she told @entity0			0
" it would most probably never happen , but the fact that it 's possible indicates the council 's prominence			0
" @entity57 -- who was once imprisoned by @entity140 forces in @entity23 -- seems to have incorporated the @entity140 military 's own counter-insurgency mantra of " @entity143 and hold " to win territory , establish control over the area , then get the locals to help govern it			1
as time goes on , @entity5 is evolving into a government whose political decision - making can not be separated from its military capabilities , according to @entity73			1
" it 's two sides of the same coin , " she said			0
" we 've seen the military side , with the war cabinet that directs brigades			0
but now on the other side we 're seeing how @entity5 wants to govern			0
the two processes inform one another			0
