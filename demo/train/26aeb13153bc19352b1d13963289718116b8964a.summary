@entity0 -- @entity3 's beef with the west has escalated after the country banned fruit , vegetables , dairy and meat products from a host of @entity12 nations including the @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and those of the @entity17			1
and by hitting agriculture in particular , @entity3 has deliberately gone for a sector key to the @entity17 's founding treaties -- one which evokes all sorts of emotive and divisive rhetoric			1
as we have seen from the decades - long , fraught battles over reforming the bloc 's most expensive scheme -- one which gobbles up some 40 % of its budget -- food production has the capacity to get @entity33 's citizens pretty upset			2
spearheaded by @entity35 in the days of post-war shortages , the @entity34 saw the then @entity37 granted the power to subsidize exports to give @entity41 countries			0
that gave @entity3 , for instance , a taste for @entity33 produce			2
it 's a strategy that worked			0
which foods are off @entity3 menus ? two decades after the iron curtain shut out the @entity17 's goods completely , @entity3 is now the bloc 's second largest consumer of foodstuffs after the @entity13 , taking $ 15.8 billion of foodstuffs annually			0
@entity12 brands have invested heavily in @entity3 and relied on the country as a key growth story they can sell to investors			1
and while @entity17 officials crunch the numbers to assess the impact of @entity33 's food sector , you can imagine ceos of the region 's biggest listed companies will be scrambling to find an alternative source to make up for those lost sales			0
but @entity33 's agriculture policies could also cost its members dear if the @entity3 ban stays in force for its full one - year duration or even beyond that time frame			1
why ? because if the sanctions cause a glut of food , the @entity17 may be forced to buy up extra stocks to keep its farmers in business			0
yet in hitting the @entity17 's agriculture sector , @entity3 is serving up just one dish on a menu that could include other damaging measures across an array of industries			1
they would be measures designed to hit different @entity17 countries in different ways -- pitting their individual economic interests against their supposed common goals			0
though @entity3 has n't used its ultimate weapon , energy , in the fight yet			0
curtailing @entity3 's gas flow to @entity33 would jeopardize @entity98 's manufacturing powerhouse and sanctions on cars and parts would hurt its sizeable automotive sector , which is already heavily geared towards @entity103 for exports			1
but it 's not just @entity3 's retaliatory sanctions that have the propensity to cause discord among @entity17 members			0
@entity12 sanctions on @entity3 's finance sector threaten @entity0 's @entity112 which has already put up a robust defense against interference from @entity115			1
further talk of canceling @entity35 's multi-billion dollar warship contracts for @entity3 has left president @entity118 indignant			0
tit - for - tat actions , such as the ones we have witnessed between @entity3 and the @entity121 , often have a way of balancing themselves out			1
@entity3 is already making a show of seeking new food suppliers like @entity126 to make up the shortfall			2
but setting up new trade relations will require time and effort before those items make it to supermarket shelves			0
in the meantime , though it 'll be hard cheese for @entity17 's agriculture sector and @entity3 's consumers too			2
