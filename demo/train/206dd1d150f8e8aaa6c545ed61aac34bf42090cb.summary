editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			2
@entity9 is @entity5 's broadband television network			0
the reports , which are produced solely by @entity5 , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- ask any @entity19 what pops into their head when they think of @entity24 , and you 'll almost assuredly get the same three things every time : pizza , garbage in the streets and the most powerful international crime syndicate in the world -- the @entity28			1
in the past 30 years , this organization rose to be valued at around 10 % of the aggregated wealth of the @entity19 nation			0
the @entity28 not only deals in illegal activities such as drugs and weapons trafficking , contraband and extortion , but additionally controls a huge amount of legal , straight businesses -- especially in transport , construction and waste management , as well as in pretty much any economic sphere in which they find an opportunity to invest			2
it is relentlessly capitalistic , has destroyed an entire city and is probably the largest criminal emergency in @entity52			0
it is certainly the biggest organization in the southern @entity19 criminal underground			0
within this reality , one distinctive music genre rose to prominence over the last two decades : neomelodics			1
neomelodic music is a strange mixture of techno , pop , @entity65 and traditional @entity24 love songs			1
it 's an entirely singular and totally bizarre form of music that , its detractors and critics say , is generally performed by nothing more than ex-criminals who have become @entity28 minstrels			2
see the rest of @entity24 neomelodics at @entity9 bred in the @entity28 - ridden , corrupt and generally all - around despairingly sad working - class underbelly of @entity24 , this army of singers tells stories of love found and lost , the crime that surrounds them , dreams of success and escape and running away from the law			1
ranging in age from 8 to 80 , the neomelodics play up to 700 gigs in a year , including weddings and birthday parties , sometimes the biggest events in a @entity24 's life			1
although they are hugely popular in their community , they often dream of entering the music charts on a national level , but their association to the @entity28 has kept them from the mainstream			1
perhaps this next generation of @entity99 singers is about to change all of that .			0
