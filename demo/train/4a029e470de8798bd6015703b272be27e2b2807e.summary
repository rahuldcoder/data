-- this fast and airy thriller about a team of four magicians is an engagingly preposterous high - wire act			2
it never stops moving ( the camerawork , dialogue , and plot twists keep rushing at you ) , and it 's exceedingly clever â € ” at least when it bothers to make sense , which is about two - thirds of the time			0
the film stars @entity13 as an arrogant card sharp , @entity15 as a mentalist who can divine anyone 's secrets , @entity19 as a lady - vixen @entity20 , and @entity22 as a wizardly thief			1
a mysterious leader brings the four of them together to do a high - powered @entity28 act that climaxes in amazing on - stage bank thefts			2
which is why a testy @entity32 agent ( @entity31 ) is soon on their trail			0
the agent gets teamed with a @entity37 @entity36 officer ( @entity38 © lanie @entity35 ) he ca n't stop flirtatiously fighting with , but his real battle is with the demon - prank illusionists whose every move is destined to outwit him			0
at times , " @entity42 " suggests @entity45 's " @entity44 " made with a throwaway wink			0
the actors , including @entity48 as an anti-showman devoted to revealing the magicians ' secrets , look like they 're having so much fun that you can forgive the periodic arbitrariness of it all			1
