@entity1 said he would definitely take another carnival cruise			2
but he has some conditions			0
" there 's no question that @entity3 should be seriously looking into their maintenance policies and double - checking their work to make sure their customers and crews are having the safest voyages possible , " wrote @entity1			1

" carnival cruise line in more troubled waters carnival has a window of opportunity to convince customers its ships can sail without too much trouble , according to several travel agents and cruisers interviewed by @entity0			1

' a grace period ' to fix things carnival has a grace period of a couple months to get its act together , according to travel agent @entity54			2
her mostly high - end clients occasionally book a more budget - oriented @entity3 for a family reunion or when they 're bringing teenagers along because " they 're the fun ships , " she said			1
" carnival has been in business for many years , and for a long time there 's never been a hitch , " said @entity54 , president of @entity61			0

@entity3 announced a " comprehensive review " this week of all its ships , prompted by the engine fire that led to the @entity48 's stranding in the @entity81 in february			1
as the biggest cruise company in the world , parent company @entity3 has a strong reputation in the industry and among its regular customers , said @entity88 , co-president of @entity89			1

" it 's all the recovery and how they treat the passengers and how they continue to build consumer confidence			2
" for those who are consistent cruisers and know carnival , i do n't think it 's going to change their buying habits			0
for new cruisers , it puts a little doubt in their minds			0

" i have n't heard anything from @entity3 , and i do n't know how long it will take to get a refund			1
now we are stuck not knowing what to do for a vacation we saved 8 years to take ! " still , @entity191 is one of those @entity3 fans who is n't giving up on the cruise line			1

" i 'm sure i could have paid $ 1,000 more per person and been impressed much more , but the carnival cruise was a great vacation and a memorable fun time			0
