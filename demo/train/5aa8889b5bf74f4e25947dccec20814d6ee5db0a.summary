@entity0 , @entity1 -- the offensive by @entity5 militants against civilians and religious minorities in the northern @entity1 governorate of @entity9 has created a catastrophe			1
at least 300,000 yazidis and 100,000 @entity12 were displaced literally overnight , according to figures provided by the @entity15 regional government			1
many of the @entity11 fled to the mountains on august 3 after @entity19 fighting forces known as @entity20 , who were protecting them , precipitously withdrew			2
for the @entity12 in villages north of @entity0 , the moment came in the wee hours of august 7 , when the @entity20 silently pulled out			2
the thousands of @entity11 who had remained stranded on a mountain seem to be getting out for now after @entity28 airstrikes helped clear a safe path for escape			2
but even if they reach a safer place in @entity15 , their longer - term prospects are grim as long as forces of @entity5 , which refers to itself as the @entity35 , control the area where they lived			2
on august 6 , i visited a @entity11 village south of @entity39 -- a magnet for 60,000 to 70,000 of the fleeing @entity11			2
they had bread and water but not much else			0
many more -- upward of 150,000 -- were on the rugged mountains a dozen or so kilometers north of @entity46			1
they found little sustenance or shelter amid the mountains ' sparse vegetation and summer temperatures of up to 120 degrees @entity53			0
perhaps 40,000 managed to escape on the northern side that day before @entity5 surrounded the mountains			1
over the following days , a few thousand more trickled out in small groups , braving @entity5 snipers as they made their way north			2
the latest @entity59 field reports say an average of more than 10,000 people a day have been crossing from @entity62 into the @entity19 region of @entity1 by a small bridge at @entity65			0
most are @entity11 , who had managed to make it down from the mountains and into @entity62 , about 20 kilometers ( about 12 miles ) away			2
@entity69 neighbors joined @entity5 slaughter , escaped @entity11 says the @entity11 are ethnically related to @entity19 but practice a 4,000 - year - old religion			1
@entity5 -- indeed many @entity72 -- consider them to be " devil worshippers , " and the militants seem intent on eliminating them as a religious community and culture			1
who are the @entity11 , and why does @entity5 want to kill them ? indeed , @entity11 were the target of what was probably the worst attack against civilians in @entity1 since the @entity28 - led invasion in 2003			1
on august 14 , 2007 , four simultaneous bombings involving a fuel tanker and three cars killed upward of 500 @entity11 , wounded more than 1,500 and destroyed nearly 400 homes			0
the explosions were so huge that no trace could be found of dozens of people closest to the explosions			0
there was no @entity1 government investigation			0
no group claimed responsibility , but it was typical of bombings by the @entity5 , predecessor to @entity5 , which had reportedly distributed leaflets in the area shortly beforehand denouncing @entity11 as " infidels			1
" the @entity5 strategy since capturing @entity1 's second - largest city , @entity102 , a month ago is apparently to clear @entity9 -- home to many of @entity1 's religious minorities -- of civilians and anyone who is n't a @entity107			1
an @entity5 photo spread distributed shortly after the capture of the @entity11 village of @entity46 showed the militants executing people who were clearly civilians			1
fast facts on @entity5 at least a dozen @entity11 men told me in the past week that @entity5 had abducted scores of women and girls , detaining large numbers in a school in @entity121 , a town northwest of @entity102			1
others were trucked across the @entity62 border to a detention center			0
@entity125 , a young @entity11 man working in @entity0 at the time of the attack , said @entity5 abducted 50 members of his extended family as they tried to escape and forced them to drive across the @entity62 border			1
his brother @entity131 drove one of the cars , his cell phone open on his lap , on speaker , while @entity125 in @entity0 kept adding funds from scratch cards to keep the line open			0
@entity131 described over four hours the route that @entity5 forced the captured family to drive into @entity62			0
" i lost contact then , " @entity125 said			0
the next day he tried the numbers of another brother			0
" do not call , " that person said			0
" we have all their mobiles , we do n't know where they are , " and hung up .			0
