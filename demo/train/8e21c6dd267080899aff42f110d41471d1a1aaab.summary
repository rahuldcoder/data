-- the @entity2 army shelled @entity3 on saturday in an effort to clear out @entity6 - linked fighters amid dueling claims by the terror group and government forces about just who was in control of the flashpoint city in the @entity14 province			1
the fighting in the @entity17 province in recent days has posed a serious challenge to prime minister @entity19 and his @entity21 - dominated government , raising questions about his ability to hold the country together amid a rising insurgency			1
conflicting reports have the @entity27 ( @entity27 ) , formerly the group commonly known as @entity6 in @entity2 , in partial control of @entity3 , the site of some of the bloodiest fighting between @entity33 forces and insurgents during the @entity35			0
@entity6 on the rebound , experts say the @entity6 - backed group proclaimed it was in control of the heart of the city , with its flags planted on some government buildings and police stations , while two police officials and two tribal leaders told @entity0 that the vast majority of the city -- including government institutions and police stations -- was in the hands of @entity17 tribesmen fighting alongside security forces			1
at least seven people were killed and another 31 were wounded in the shelling , according to medical officials at @entity57			1
fierce street - to - street fighting , between the insurgents and @entity17 tribesmen aligned with police , also was reported in the provincial capital of @entity63			2
police say a number of casualties have been reported in the city , but did not offer a specific number			0
the @entity6 militants in @entity63 warned @entity19 and tribesmen to withdraw from the area or face violent consequences			1
in a video posted on @entity76 , militants wearing masks warned @entity19 's supporters in @entity63 that they must stop helping " @entity19 commit crimes in @entity14 or you will face harsh punishments			2
" @entity19 has vowed to crush the insurgency in @entity14 province , where the @entity17 insurgency -- @entity6 in @entity2 -- flourished following the 2003 @entity33 - led invasion that toppled @entity85			1
" there will be no withdrawal , " @entity19 said in a speech saturday carried by @entity87			2
fresh fighting dozens have been killed and more than 100 wounded in fighting that broke out late last week following a raid on the home of prominent @entity17 lawmaker @entity95 , a prominent supporter of anti-government protests			1
@entity99 's brother and five of his bodyguards were killed during the raid , during which at least 16 other people were wounded , authorities said			2
that was quickly followed by a move to close two protest camps that were established last year as part of ongoing demonstrations against the @entity21 - led government , which protesters have said has marginalized the country 's minority @entity17 population			1
since the withdrawal of @entity33 troops in 2011 , @entity2 's minority @entity17 have become increasingly marginalized			0
they have accused @entity19 of trying to consolidate power by carrying out mass arrests of @entity17			2
even so , a number of @entity17 tribal leaders struck a deal with the government this week to fight alongside @entity2 's security forces against @entity6 forces			1
the deal the government made with the @entity17 tribal fighters was comparable to a 2007 @entity33 pact that saw @entity17 turn on @entity6 , siding with @entity33 and @entity2 forces to bring about an end to the terrorism			1
violent flashback the fighting between @entity17 militants against @entity21 - dominated forces was reminiscent of fighting during the height of the @entity2 war in 2006 and 2007 , when sectarian violence nearly tore the country apart			0
@entity140 spokeswoman @entity139 dismissed suggestions that the @entity33 has abandoned @entity2 following its withdrawal from the country in 2011			0
" let 's be clear who 's responsible for the violence -- it 's the terrorists who were behind it , " she told reporters in @entity149 on friday			0
" that 's why we are partnering with the @entity2 government very closely to fight this shared threat			0
at the end of the day , we can certainly help them fight it , but we also want to help them build their own capability to do so themselves			0
" the @entity33 is sending weapons , including hellfire rockets and drones , to aid in the campaign against terrorism , officials have said			0
@entity139 said a number of @entity33 officials in @entity2 and in @entity149 " remain in touch with all of the different parties in @entity2			0
" @entity0 's @entity173 and @entity174 contributed to this report .			0
