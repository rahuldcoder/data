-- the sister of @entity3 ceo @entity2 says there are no hard feelings after a " leaked " family photo raised questions about online etiquette and privacy on the social network			1
@entity11 , @entity3 's former marketing chief and producer of the @entity14 reality series " @entity15 , " posted a photo wednesday of her family laughing with their smartphones while apparently playing with @entity3 's new @entity20 app. in the background of the photo , taken in a spacious kitchen , is her brother @entity24 , sporting his trademark hoodie			1
it 's unclear exactly what happened next			0
either @entity2 accidentally made the photo available to all her subscribers instead of only her friends , or a friend of a friend saw it when one of @entity2 's friends " liked " or commented on it			1
either way , @entity38 , a marketing director for @entity39 , saw it and shared it on @entity43 with her 40,000 followers			1
" @ randizuckerberg demonstrates her family 's response to @entity20 , " she wrote , with a link to the photo			1
@entity2 quickly replied : " not sure where you got this photo			1
i posted it only to friends on @entity3			2
you reposting it on @entity43 is way uncool			2
" she then turned around and offered more general commentary to 132,000 followers of her own			0
" @entity62 etiquette : always ask permission before posting a friend 's photo publicly			2
it 's not about privacy settings , it 's about human decency , " she wrote			2
( most of those comments have since been deleted but were captured by tech blogs and other sites			0
) what , if anything , the incident says about @entity3 's privacy policies is subject to debate			1
some internet wags were quick to pounce on the episode as an ironic example of @entity3 's confusing privacy settings : see ? protecting your information on @entity3 is so tricky that even a former @entity3 executive could n't do it			1
but who among us has never misclicked something in a drop - down menu ? and if @entity38 did , in fact , see the photo because a friend commented on it , that 's how @entity3 is supposed to work -- unless users have adjusted their default settings			1
@entity97 , though , is always a tricky business for the social megasite			0
this month , @entity3 announced an overhaul to its privacy settings , addressing past complaints that the tools available to clamp down on one 's profile are scattered and hard to find , much less use			1
and @entity107 , the @entity3 - owned photo apps , recently backed down on a controversial change to its terms of use that appeared to give the company the right to sell photos to advertisers			2
that said , all appears to have ended well in @entity11 's case			2
@entity38 quickly issued a mea culpa			0
" i 'm just your subscriber and this was top of my newsfeed			0
genuinely sorry but it came up in my feed and seemed public , " she tweeted to @entity2			0
and later : " fwiw , i thought the photo was incredibly endearing which is why i liked it			0
we never see humans on the @entity128 ! " by thursday , @entity2 was putting a happy face on the whole thing			0
" @entity132 , i 've been exchanging emails w / @ cschweitz & she seems lovely , " she wrote			0
" the silver lining ? glad to see a thoughtful debate on sharing / etiquette			0

@entity11 , former @entity3 exec and ceo 's sister , in flap over shared photo
she said a family photo on @entity3 was for friends , but it was seen and shared on @entity43
some say issue speaks to confusion over @entity3 's privacy controls
@entity2 says it 's about etiquette , not privacy and that all is well
