-- @entity1 emerged as genuine contenders for football 's @entity4 crown with a thumping 4 - 1 win over @entity7 after co-hosts @entity8 and 2004 champions @entity11 had opened the tournament with a dramatic 1 - 1 draw in @entity14			1
@entity15 scored twice as @entity17 's @entity1 side made a confident start , @entity19 and substitute @entity20 completing the rout after @entity22 had briefly threatened a @entity7 comeback			1
@entity1 , who reached the semi-finals of @entity26 under @entity27 , next face co-hosts @entity8 , who saw @entity31 's first - half header cancelled out by @entity11 substitute @entity32 ' second - half goal in @entity14			1
but the goalscorers barely told the tale of a remarkable opening match			0
both sides had a player sent off - @entity39 for @entity11 and @entity8 goalkeeper @entity40 -- before the @entity43 goalkeeper 's replacement @entity44 emerged as the hero by saving a penalty from @entity47			1
@entity8 1 - 1 @entity11 two goals , two red cards and a missed penalty in the tournament 's opening game meant that the focus of @entity54 shifted firmly to football			1
fears of racism had dominated the build - up to the tournament and there was an inevitable feeling of relief when the opening game finally got under way in @entity14			0
a brief but beautiful opening ceremony - just 12 minutes long - set the scene for the three - week tournament before the home crowd came close to lifting the closed roof off the @entity70 with a rousing rendition of the national anthem			0
it was a vocal chorused outside the stadium by 100,000 supporters crammed into a specially - built fan zone in the center of @entity14 -- and those almost exclusively @entity8 fans had plenty to shout about in the opening 20 minutes of the opening game			2
co-hosts @entity8 looked to be cruising to their first - ever @entity84 finals victory when @entity85 striker @entity31 headed home @entity87 's cross , with @entity11 keeper @entity89 stuck in no - man 's land			1
it was a special moment for @entity31 , who was born in @entity14 and proved a constant menace to the hapless @entity94 defence in a one - sided first half			0
@entity54 : the best photos from day one and when @entity11 lost both their starting centre backs - @entity99 limping off injured before @entity39 was sent off for two bookings in nine first - half minutes -- it seemed a matter of how many for @entity31 and @entity8			1
somehow , @entity11 manager @entity103 instigated a response to silence the @entity106 fans in and out of the stadium , with substitute salpigidis the central character			2
just six minutes after coming on as a half - time substitute , @entity32 poked an equaliser past stranded goalkeeper @entity40			0
suddenly it was the @entity94 fans - so burdened by national crisis , so weighed down by @entity117 millstones - with something to celebrate			0
it got worse for @entity43 keeper @entity40 when he saw red for a clumsy trip on substitute @entity32 , but his replacement @entity44 guessed right to push away @entity11 captain @entity47 ' penalty			1
the @entity14 party was back on -- and two of the tournament underdogs had set a high standard of entertainment for the rest to follow			0
@entity1 4 - 1 @entity7 over in @entity129 , @entity1 and @entity7 continued to defy @entity131 's pre-tournament image as the " least exciting " section , with @entity17 's side capitalising on some weak @entity7 defending			1
these two sides had been installed as favourites to qualify from the group , but only the @entity137 lived up to that hype in a game dominated by @entity17 's side			1
former @entity43 forward @entity140 was the architecht of their dominance , playing a crucial part in the opening goal from @entity15 and then playing a defence - splitting pass to set up @entity19 for the second			0
@entity150 's superbly taken goal early in the second half gave the @entity151 hope and they had chances to level before substitute @entity20 set up @entity15 for his second and then himself wrapped up victory with a thumping finish			2
@entity20 had been ledft out of @entity1 's starting line - up , yet still played a crucial role in helping finish off the @entity151 when he replaced the tiring @entity158 17 minutes from time			2
it was a cameo role not lost on two - goal hero @entity15 , who told @entity161 's official website : " it was hard for us at 2 - 1 but a big performance from @entity20 helped us and we want to thank him for this			1
" it is very important that we performed well in the first game -- it is one of the six steps to the final			0
" @entity7 coach @entity172 admitted his side had struggled to cope with the @entity137 ' forward movement and link - up play			2
he conceded : " we had problems with the combinations of the @entity137			0
they had a lot of chances and we could not get the ball off them			0
@entity172 added : " they have great technique and showed us today what a great team they are			0

two players sent off as co-hosts @entity8 draw 1 - 1 with 2004 champions @entity11
@entity8 's substitute keeper @entity44 saves @entity47 ' penalty
@entity1 cruise to 4 - 1 win over @entity7 in @entity129
@entity15 scores twice for @entity17 's side
