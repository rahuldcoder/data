@entity0 -- @entity2 is not backing down from its charge that @entity5 's mother and her lawyers leaked e-mails to a reporter , in violation of a court order , despite a claim of responsibility by someone not connected to the @entity5 's wrongful - death lawsuit against the concert promoter			1
the dramatic e-mails , published in the @entity17 on sunday , revealed the promoter for @entity5 's " @entity20 " concerts expressed doubts about the star 's health and his ability to be ready for the shows for several months before his death			1
@entity27 , who partnered with @entity28 on a book about her family , acknowledged to @entity1 wednesday that he gave the controversial documents to @entity17 reporter @entity32			1
@entity27 said he obtained the documents from various sources , but none of them came from the @entity37 or their lawyers			1
some of the documents were part of discovery in other cases , including the criminal trial of dr. @entity44 , he said			0
" the @entity17 does not comment on sources , " @entity45 said in response to @entity1 's request for comment on @entity27 's claim that he gave them to her			2
@entity27 was involved in a bitter copyright dispute concerning that book with @entity5 's estate at the time he gave the reporter the documents , but the lawsuit was settled earlier this week			1
e-mails show promoter 's doubts before @entity5 's death @entity2 lawyer @entity63 , who said tuesday that he had " unequivocal evidence " showing that @entity5 's mother and her lawyers leaked the e-mails , has asked the judge in the wrongful - death suit to punish @entity5 with fines and exclude the e-mails as evidence in the case			1
" the documents released to the press were given to @entity28 and her attorneys -- and to no one else -- confidentially in discovery and subject to a court order , " @entity63 said tuesday			0
on thursday , he called it " convenient that @entity27 -- a longtime business partner of the @entity79 -- has come forward in this fashion			2
" " whether these documents were leaked through an intermediary or directly by @entity28 and her counsel , this remains an egregious violation of the court 's order requiring immediate sanctions and an investigation , " the @entity2 lawyer said			1
@entity63 accused @entity5 and her lawyers of leaking the documents -- despite that their " publication hurts her son 's memory and her grandchildren more than anyone else " -- because they " know they can not win on the law and are losing control over the case			2
" " after months of discovery , plaintiffs now know what we have known all along -- there is nothing to support their claims , " the @entity2 lawyer said			2
@entity5 lawyer @entity110 said the admission by @entity27 that he was the source of the e-mails should settle the matter			1
" he ( @entity27 ) definitely never received any documents from @entity28 , @entity116 , @entity117 , or @entity118 , nor from their lawyers in the wrongful death suit against @entity2 , " said @entity5 lawyer @entity110			1
@entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 are @entity5 's children			0
@entity110 criticized @entity2 's lawyers for their haste in pointing the finger at the @entity37			1
" @entity2 made these accusations against the @entity79 and their lawyers apparently without doing even the most rudimentary investigation , " @entity110 said			2
" we are further disturbed that the motion for sanctions filed by @entity2 was given to the press before it was served on @entity28 or her counsel			2
" if the @entity2 lawyers had reached out to the @entity5 lawyers earlier , they could have helped solve the mystery of the leaked documents , he said			1
" @entity2 has known about the alleged leak since a week before the article was published , " @entity110 said			2
" @entity2 never contacted the @entity5 's counsel to inquire about the article or the documents			1
" the documents made public in the @entity17 story are not the most damaging to @entity2 that were uncovered , @entity110 said			2
" we can assure you that we are in possession of documents that make for an extremely compelling story in the wrongful - death case , and that completely support the plaintiffs ' claims , " he said			2
@entity5 copyright dispute settled @entity1 has learned from a lawyer for an insurance company embroiled in a lawsuit with @entity2 that @entity27 approached him several weeks ago offering the same documents to help their case against the promoter			1
the company declined to follow up since they did not know their authenticity , attorney @entity163 said			0
@entity27 alerted the lawyer saturday that the e-mails would be published in the newspaper sunday , @entity163 said			1
" the first time we saw these documents was in the @entity17 article			0
" the existence of the e-mails , which were not turned over to the insurance company during the discovery phase of the case , have complicated @entity2 's effort to prevent a court from voiding the $ 17.5 million policy that @entity2 purchased through @entity180 , he said			1
" we are looking for information about @entity5 's prior drug use and the failure of @entity2 to disclose the facts and what the truth was prior to our client 's issuance of the policy , " @entity163 said			1
the @entity2 lawyer said the insurance company can expect to get the e-mails eventually			1
" it appears the lawyers for the insurance company did what any ethical lawyer would do : they refused to receive documents leaked in violation of the @entity199 's order			1
and i have every reason to believe the insurers will now receive those same documents as discovery continues , " @entity63 said			0
@entity5 died on june 25 , 2009 , from what the @entity205 coroner ruled was an overdose of a surgical anesthetic and sedatives , drugs that dr. @entity44 told police he used to help the entertainer sleep as he prepared for the concerts set to start two weeks later			0
the insurer contends @entity2 hid @entity5 's health problems and failed to respond to repeated requests for his medical history when applying for insurance for the 50 shows scheduled for @entity221 's @entity220			1
the wrongful - death suit , filed by @entity28 and her son 's three children , contends that @entity2 contributed to the pop star 's death by pressuring him to prepare even though the promoters knew he was in a weak condition and by its hiring and supervision of dr. @entity44			1
@entity44 was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to four years in prison last year			0
" @entity235 did not hire dr. @entity44 nor were they responsible for the death of @entity5 , " @entity2 lawyer @entity63 told @entity1 tuesday			1
@entity2 , the president of @entity2 -- the concert - promotion branch of @entity2 -- called @entity5 's death " a terrible tragedy " in one e-mail written weeks after he died , adding " but life must go on			1
" " @entity2 will make a fortune from merch sales , ticket retention , the touring exhibition and the film / dvd , " @entity2 wrote			2
in fact , @entity2 was allowed to sell @entity5 tour merchandise and share in the profits from the documentary " @entity20 , " produced from rehearsal video			2
the e-mails suggest @entity2 's president saw @entity5 's problems first - hand the day the pop star was to appear at the @entity220 to publicly announce the shows			1
" @entity5 is locked in his room drunk and despondent , " @entity2 wrote in a march 5 , 2009 , e-mail to @entity2 's parent company , the paper reported			1
" i ( am ) trying to sober him up			0
" " i screamed at him so loud the walls are shaking , " @entity2 wrote			2
" he is an emotionally paralyzed mess riddled with self - loathing and doubt now that it is show time			0
" the promoter blamed @entity221 traffic when @entity5 was 90 minutes late for the announcement that day			0
" he 's as healthy as he can be -- no health problems whatsoever , " @entity2 told @entity1 two months later to refute reports @entity5 's health was threatening the concerts			2
the @entity17 story , however , said the e-mails indicated major doubts about @entity5 's ability to perform			0
" we can not be forced into stopping this , which @entity5 will try to do because he is lazy and constantly changes his mind to fit his immediate wants , " @entity2 executive @entity281 e-mailed to @entity2			0
@entity5 's missed rehearsals in june triggered concerns in e-mails that he was slow in learning his dance routines and would have to lip - sync on stage , the newspaper reported			0
" @entity5 is not in shape enough yet to sing this stuff live and dance at the same time , " one e-mail from the show 's music director read , the paper reported			0
a production manager wrote : " he was a basket case			0
" a loud warning from show director @entity305 , who worked closely with @entity5 on previous tours , came in mid-june , just over a week before his death			0
@entity305 wrote to @entity2 that @entity5 had " strong signs of paranoia , anxiety and obsessive - like behavior " and suggesting they bring a " top psychiatrist in to evaluate him asap			0
" " it is like there are two people there			0
one ( deep inside ) trying to hold on to what he was and still can be and not wanting us to quit him , the other in this weakened and troubled state , " @entity305 wrote			0
" i believe we need professional guidance in this matter			0
" @entity305 testified at @entity44 's trial about his concerns about @entity5 's frail condition and missed rehearsals			0
it resulted in a meeting six days before @entity5 's death in which @entity44 assured the promoters he would have @entity5 ready for rehearsals that next week			0
an e-mail from @entity2 after that meeting said he had confidence in @entity44 " who i am gaining immense respect for as i get to deal with him more			0
" " this doctor is extremely successful ( we check everyone out ) and does not need this gig , so he ( is ) totally unbiased and ethical , " @entity2 ' e-mail said .			0
