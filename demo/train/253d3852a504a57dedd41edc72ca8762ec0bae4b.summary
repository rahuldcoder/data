before being appointed as ceo of @entity2 , @entity14 was at the office of the first deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs as technical advisor			1
he joins us on @entity26 to talk about the vision for @entity4 , how @entity4 @entity2 fits into it and its investments outside @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34			1
with oil prices hitting $ 88 this week , @entity35 begins by asking @entity1 about the differences he sees now compared to the 1970s when oil prices were also high			2
any lessons learned ? @entity1 : i believe so			2
in the 1970s , local government here did not deal in a very sophisticated way with this wealth			0
but now we are fortunate with a high level of education and the reformations in government policies in this region			0
we now understand how to utilize this wealth and economical growth			0
@entity53 : i do n't think most people know that you sit on one of the largest natural gas fields in the world and will likely be the largest exporter by 2010			0
this must give you great cushion to expand the @entity4 @entity2 model			1
na : although we have this and we are fortunate with this , @entity4 has adopted a policy to diversify its portfolio from its natural resources to other investment opportunities and one of them is @entity2			1
we are investing a lot in real estate , not just in @entity4 but worldwide			2
@entity53 : in fact very close in the neighborhood as well			0
it 's almost foreign policy strategy to invest in the poorer countries in the region			2
is this to help the neighborhood develop alongside @entity4 ? na : i think with the knowledge and know - how that we have gained in this area of expertise , we would like to export it to other countries to help their economical reformations ; to try to create business opportunities for their local businessmen and to create job opportunities for the people in that particular country			1
@entity53 : it 's quite a radical departure say from the @entity97 or @entity98 giving loans or grants for development			0
this is turning the world upside down in your region , it is not ? na : yes , i would like to assure you at @entity2 we are not in the business of lending			2
@entity53 : you want a hard return			0
na : we want return but we always think of the people when we are investing in these countries			0
i mean we want to make sure that the investment we are making is there for the long - term			0
@entity4 @entity2 has a policy : it 's a long - term policy not short - term			1
@entity53 : give me some insight on why @entity2 feels as comfortable in @entity8 with @entity7 as in @entity122 , for example , with some of the projects you 're undertaking			1
what makes you think you can pull that off ? na : i think with the expertise that we have and with the strength that we have , we would like to showcase the strength of the people of @entity4 and we want to pull the flag of the state of @entity4 even across the @entity136 and we are determined to do so			1
we are a small country but with big ideas			0
