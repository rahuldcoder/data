-- military intervention in @entity2 has been swift -- it took only a few months for foreign forces to step in to start helping the population			0
yet 10 years ago , the conflict in @entity7 began			1
many darfuris are still waiting for the international community to help stop the bloodshed and ethnic cleansing			1
civilians are still being systematically targeted , raped and killed and a recent upsurge in state - sponsored violence and human rights abuses is particularly worrying			1
yet the response from the international community is to look the other way			1
watch video : warning of new @entity22 disaster why the rush to help @entity2 while @entity7 has suffered for a decade ? quite simply , the answer is fear			2
as @entity29 prime minister @entity28 claimed this january , all of @entity27 is becoming a " magnet " for jihadists from other countries			0
the @entity33 is worried about the possibility of an @entity36 - aligned state , one that could offer a base to jihadist groups , allowing them to promote and export its extremist ideology -- a new @entity42 , just when the international community 's intervention there is set to wind down			1
but the international community already confronts a similar reality in @entity22 -- it just fails to truly understand the ugly nature of president @entity50 's regime			1
you only have to take a look at the friends he keeps , including @entity55 -- designated by the @entity57 government as a sponsor of international terrorism			2
and let 's not forget @entity22 's long history of harboring global terrorists			0
in the early 1990s this included international terrorist " most wanted , @entity64			2
even today , analysts think elements of @entity67 and other international jihadists still linger in @entity22 , and at the beginning of this year , an @entity67 student wing was established at @entity71			0
domestically , the @entity22 government promotes a violent , extreme form of @entity75 law			0
at the very least this means anyone who fails to live by their strict and extreme interpretation of @entity36 is castigated with public floggings and jail sentences			0
moderate @entity82 who signed the @entity83 in january -- separating religion from state -- were labeled non-believers and infidels			0
at worst , @entity89 's attempt to establish a racially pure @entity91 state involves waging war against its own unarmed civilians , systematically and with impunity			0
in @entity7 this has lasted a decade			2
the @entity96 estimates that 300,000 @entity97 have died since 2003 , but it has n't bothered to estimate casualty numbers since 2008			1
with fighting continuing to this day , the number is likely to be far higher			0
however , since these human - rights violations occur in a media vacuum the world assumes " @entity7 is over			1
" it is n't -- and wo n't be until the international community stops applying a lesser standard to @entity97 than to others who have needed its help			1
that 's why a coalition of @entity7 organizations , like the @entity112 and @entity113 like waging peace -- which campaigns against genocide and human rights abuses in @entity22 -- are launching a new campaign , @entity118 , to bring this war - torn region back onto the international agenda			1
taking action need not require lengthy international negotiations			0
let 's just start by finally implementing the numerous @entity96 resolutions against @entity22 since 2004			2
targeted smart sanctions against the personal finances of the architects of @entity7 's genocide would help			1
as would travel bans for high - ranking officials , stocking up on luxury goods from @entity133			0
and no - fly zones would stop the government 's antonovs from bombing @entity7 citizens			1
but addressing the underlying cause of @entity22 's troubles means ensuring @entity50 and others in his regime are brought to the @entity142 to stand trial for crimes against humanity			0
media outlets are already publishing retrospectives on @entity7 , 10 years on			1
but for the inhabitants of this blighted land , we are still staring the conflict in the face -- every day			0
it 's time to take action			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity157			2

10 years after conflict began , @entity97 still waiting for end to bloodshed , says @entity157
international community ignoring a recent upsurge in violence there , he says
he argues that @entity96 should implement its sanctions and impose no - fly zone
' @entity7 10 ' campaign aims to put the crisis back on the international agenda
