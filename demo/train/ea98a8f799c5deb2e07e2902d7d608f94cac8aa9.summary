-- hard as it may be for anyone under 30 to imagine , there was a time when people used to shoot eight - millimeter films while on vacation and then show them to friends and family gathered around a projector in the living room			1
nowadays , capturing video is far easier ( whether you use a video camera , a digital still camera with video capability or even a cell phone ) , as is the sharing : @entity19 has proved that millions of folks have learned to upload video to a computer and instantly e-mail a link to family and friends			1
whether you use a video camera , a digital still camera with video capability , or even a cell phone , capturing video has never been easier			1
while @entity19 remains a popular venue for sharing vacation videos , web sites specifically targeting travelers are also springing up			1
the quality of the applications and usefulness of the content , however , vary greatly			2
we tested four to see which are easiest , which have bugs to work out and which can even help you offset your travel costs			2
@entity44 for anyone just getting the hang of online video sharing , no - frills @entity48 -- founded by veterans of @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 -- is a good start			1
before you upload a video , @entity44 directs you through a simple registration process and asks you to write a short description of your clip			1
when the video is posted , you can e-mail friends to tell them to watch it			1
you can also create a profile page to list your videos , add links to other people 's clips and indicate on a world map where you 've been and where you 'd like to go			2
cool : similar to @entity19 , @entity44 gives an embed code for most postings , allowing anyone on the @entity72 to add the clip to his or her own web site or blog			1
likewise , @entity19 videos can be embedded into @entity44			1
not cool : no registration is required to leave comments on other people 's videos , leading to spam			2
@entity44 also does n't restrict who can post videos , so some material on the site comes from tourism promoters			1
upload time : painfully slow at 20 minutes			0
* @entity89 @entity89 is a general - interest video - sharing site with a category devoted to travel clips			1
its process for uploading a video is similar to @entity44 's , but the personal " dashboard " is much more sophisticated			1
you can collect friends , à la @entity98 , and add other people 's videos to your playlist ( a compilation of favorite clips )			0
there are also more ways to share your videos : the site allows you to use embed codes to link your videos to social - networking sites , and your friends can download the clips as podcasts in @entity113			1
cool : the site affixes small advertisements to the bottom of every video , usually promoting something germane			2
( for example , an ad for a @entity121 hotel is attached to a home movie of @entity124			0
) @entity89 then pays you half the revenue it makes from the video ads -- the total depends on how many people view the ads or click on them			1
you can track how much you 've made in your dashboard , and you 're automatically paid through @entity133 once you 've earned at least $ 20			0
the creators of an extremely popular @entity137 and @entity138 video on the site have made $ 50,000			2
not cool : editors screen all of the videos to ensure that no obscene or copyrighted material will be posted to the site -- the process can take several hours or even a day			0
if your video has more than 10 seconds of a @entity151 song in the background , for instance , the editors could consider it a copyright violation and block the clip 's posting			1
upload time : five minutes			0
@entity157 founded by four friends in @entity159 , including former @entity161 chief executive @entity160 , @entity157 is geared toward people who think of themselves as filmmakers , professional or otherwise , with higher - quality and more informative clips than those on other video - sharing sites			1
but that should n't deter the novice videographer ; @entity157 's videos may be slicker than those on other web sites , but the site is n't necessarily more exclusive			1
the staff posts all videos submitted by users unless the clips are offensive			2
there are also tips on producing better videos , such as finding an opening or closing shot and writing a more natural script			0
cool : the site has a @entity184 in which people pitch ideas for video travel stories to the editors and -- if their ideas are accepted -- are paid at least $ 50 for each clip they produce			1
if you ask , the staff may edit your video to make it look more professional or give advice on how to do it yourself			2
the site also occasionally gives away an @entity198 to the creators of the top videos			0
not cool : @entity157 is less than a year old , so traffic is low			0
there are just 700 videos on the site ; only a handful have more than a few thousand viewings			0
upload time : six minutes			0
zoom and go @entity209 sees itself as a combination of @entity211 and @entity19			0
the site allows users to not only upload videos and photos , but also to write reviews for hotels , destinations and attractions , and to search for hotels in certain cities			2
navigating the site , however , can be slightly problematic			0
when you click on a city like @entity226 , for instance , you can add it to your @entity228 , but that just creates a list of bookmarked places -- there 's no actual planning function yet			0
the site also has a tool to check hotel availability , but clicking on the link to book the room in both @entity239 and @entity240 led to an error page			0
cool : zoom and @entity243 does n't attach ads to videos , but it 's launching a system that 'll award points for every video , photo and review posted on the site			1
the points will then be redeemable for money that 'll go to the charity of the user 's choice			0
videos will be worth 30 points apiece ; every 100 points accrued will earn $ 1			0
the editors also say that all content is provided by actual travelers , not tourism promoters			2
not cool : although zoom and go claims to have the largest collection of travel videos on the @entity72 ( more than 14,000 ) , the clips are rarely longer than a minute , providing just a cursory glimpse of a hotel lobby or a tourist destination			0
upload time : seven minutes			0
* for all tests , we used broadband @entity275 to upload a four - minute clip			1
