-- calling him " one of the most violent and despicable criminals in @entity11 history , " prosecutors argued thursday that convicted mob boss @entity3 should never set foot on the streets of that city -- or any city -- again			1
" having now been convicted of 31 felonies , including ... counts involving multiple murders , @entity3 richly deserves to spend the rest of his life in jail , " @entity13 attorney @entity12 said in a sentencing memorandum filed thursday			1
@entity3 embarked on what prosecutors called " a decades - long crime spree " and then went into hiding			2
he was finally found , after 16 years on the run , with his girlfriend , @entity26 , in @entity27 , @entity28 , in 2011			0
a two - month trial culminated in his conviction last august on various counts such as racketeering , extortion , and money laundering			0
the federal jury linked him to 11 murders ; the government had alleged he had a role in 19 such killings between 1973 and 1985 ; the jury said it had failed to prove his involvement in seven of those and had " no finding " in the other			1
the 84 - year - old 's sentencing hearing is set to begin wednesday			0
the prosecutor noted that convictions on many of the counts mandate a life sentence			2
" there are no mitigating factors , and defendant @entity3 has no redeeming qualities , which would justify any sentence below the one called for by the @entity56 and the applicable case law and statutes , " @entity51 wrote			1
the prosecutor also asked the court to take steps " to prevent any money -- where earned from his crimes or obtained in the future -- from finding its way into @entity3 's pocket			2
" she also asked that restitution be paid to the murder victims			0
paperwork filed earlier in federal court indicated @entity3 generated well over $ 25 million in racketeering proceeds between 1972 and around 2000 , five years after he went on the lam after being tipped off by his rogue @entity76 informant to a pending indictment			0
the sentencing memorandum also summarized what the government describes as " @entity3 's horrific crimes and sadistic behavior " as further proof " that he deserves no mercy at the time of sentencing			1
" " @entity90 over a massive criminal enterprise , @entity3 extorted dozens of individuals , flooded @entity11 with cocaine , shot innocent people , strangled women , murdered his competitors , corrupted @entity76 agents , and then ran away and hid for 16 years , " the prosecutor said			1
their judgment did n't improve during this summer 's trial , with @entity51 accusing @entity3 of playing " an elaborate game of ' @entity105 ' " by denying being an @entity76 informant while at the same time insisting the federal government " had given him full immunity			0
