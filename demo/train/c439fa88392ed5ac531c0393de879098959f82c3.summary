-- investigators now say that , according to automated electronic connections attempts by the @entity5 data reporting system of @entity7 , the airplane flew far to the west , in an entirely different direction than it should have been heading as per its original flight - planned route , which was to the north			1
the 90 - degree turn to the west might have been purely random if entered by a nonpilot or inexpert pilot who knew simply how to turn a single knob ( called the heading bug ) that could command the autopilot to make a turn to a new heading ( or direction )			1
there is strong evidence that this is not what happened			0
investigators now believe , according to news reports , that after its transponder and @entity5 radio were turned off , turns were initiated at @entity32			0
these waypoints are essentially virtual checkpoints in the sky , defining markers charted by airspace regulators that create pathways in the air that airplanes follow to keep safely separated from each other			2
the waypoints are defined by an exact latitude and longitude and can be located by a number of the airplane 's various navigators , including @entity48			0
if the reports of the flight path are true , it is not a route that could happen by accident			1
there are two ways the 777 - 200 could have flown on this path			2
after passing one waypoint , it could have been directed to fly to the next waypoint by a pilot turning the heading knob toward that exact place , a process that would require some piloting expertise			1
this would be very unusual , and a novice or pilot without much flying experience on this plane would not know to make these kinds of inputs or have any conceivable reason to do so			2
the almost certain explanation would be that these waypoints were programmed into the flight management system of the 777 - 200 , a task that would have been beyond the abilities of anyone but a professional pilot			1
the autopilot follows the course put into the flight management system by the pilots			2
that is , when the autopilot is not being manually controlled instead			0
the manual control part is easy			0
you turn a knob and the airplane goes where you ask it to			0
the flight management system part is very complicated			2
i am a commercial pilot , and i have done some training on the @entity95			0
even after a few hours of professional instruction i would have been unable to program the flight management system to command the autopilot to fly the flight plan that @entity7 reportedly flew			1
this leaves us with one of two possible conclusions			0
either the flight was commandeered by a group with at least one professionally trained pilot among them or one of the pilots in control programmed the new off - route flight plan into the flight management system			1
the latter would be far more likely			0
when terrorists hijacked the airplanes that were flown into the @entity116 towers and the @entity117 , they flew the airplanes by hand and those hijackers had trained for months with that exact mission in mind			0
in the case of flight 370 , it would almost certainly have remained on autopilot , which would have dutifully followed the flight plan in the flight management system			1
that flight plan was quite possibly entered for some mysterious reason by a trained pilot			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity135 .			1

@entity135 : new clues *suggest* that flight 370 did *n't* change course randomly
@entity135 : only a professional pilot can program *specific* route pathways
he believes that whoever *altered* the flight path was someone with expertise
