frugal , cold and boring -- those are just some of the words @entity3 's chancellor @entity2 has been called by her peers and the global press days before the @entity7 election			1
so how did a quiet , unassuming fraulein from a small , rural town in the former communist - ruled @entity7 ( @entity7 ) become arguably the most powerful female politician of all time ? while the constant chatter of fixing the @entity15 has recently abated , the @entity13 leader was a popular choice for another term with strong approval ratings thanks to securing the country 's lowest unemployment rate in two decades			1
upon completion of her recently won third term as chancellor , by 2016 she will become the longest - serving elected female head of government in history			1
the original " @entity27 " @entity28 , who served @entity29 for 11 years as prime minister , currently holds this record			0
@entity2 's rise from political obscurity to the highest publicly elected office in @entity3 is a captivating tale			1
born in @entity3 , her father @entity36 , a @entity37 pastor moved the family in 1957 to the small town of @entity40 in @entity7 shortly before the erection of the @entity42			1
humble beginnings growing up under communist rule in @entity7 would have had a strong impact on the future chancellor			1
while she has often said she was never interested in the politics of the new state , her world view was shaped by her surroundings			0
the restrictions and ever - present secret police -- the @entity54 -- taught @entity2 the importance of discretion and when to speak up			1
through her childhood , @entity2 was strong academically and teachers praised her skills in math and language , but it was the sciences that caught her attention			2
in turn , she went on to study physics at the @entity67			0
the characteristics that come from being a scientist have become one of her defining skills as a politician			0
as @entity73 writes in @entity2 's authorized biography , " @entity2 -- the chancellor and @entity77 " : " @entity2 shapes her world view in an analytical way			1
she weighs up arguments , industriously collects facts , considers the pros and cons ... " she admires people with qualities that are not her own , but prefers to work her way steadily forward			0
herein lies @entity2 's problem : if her opponent does n't use rational arguments , then the logical framework ceases to function , arguments can not be weighted against each other and compromises can not be reached			1
" deja vu ? upon leaving university and earning her phd , @entity2 initially worked as a quantum chemist at the @entity95 in @entity96 before joining the a small independent party , @entity97 shortly before reunification between @entity7 and @entity3			1
she swiftly rose through the ranks of the party , which quickly aligned with then - chancellor of @entity3 @entity101			0
by the time the @entity42 fell in october of 1990 , @entity2 was working as deputy press secretary to the @entity7 premier			1
in the following months , she watched diplomacy in action and the rapid financial collapse of @entity7 after reunification			2
put simply , this experience shaped her economic world view forever			0
" look , i 've experienced the collapse of a country , the @entity7 , " she said in april at an event with the @entity112 prime minister , @entity111			2
" the economic system failed under the aegis of the @entity117			0
" what i really do n't want is to look on , eyes open , as @entity121 as a whole slips back			0
i would find that absurd , we have all the skills in our hands			0
" unafraid to say ' nein ' viewed as the de facto leader of @entity121 , @entity2 's legacy will largely be determined by the outcome of the euro crisis			1
thrust into the center of @entity121 's ailing economic landscape , she has taken a hard line with neighboring countries and world leaders			2
" in the debt crisis , @entity2 is seen as the hard - bitten , humorless , austerity - enforcing " madame non " who refuses to underwrite the rest of the euro area 's debt , " writes journalists @entity142 and @entity144 in their recent book , @entity2 : a @entity146 in @entity147			1
bringing her own brand of @entity3 's social market economy to the world stage with her divisive austerity measures , @entity2 operates a step - by - step approach to her politics			1
as @entity142 and @entity144 write : " ... @entity2 consults widely to better formulate her approach to policy making			2
she is not given to snap , intuitive decisions , but is rather very deliberate in the way she reaches her conclusions			0
" but what also makes @entity2 most unusual is how little her lifestyle has changed since assuming power			2
in contrast to fellow politicians , she lives a modest way of life residing in her @entity96 apartment with her second husband @entity167			0
what 's more , she does n't put on lavish displays when hosting world leaders and she continues to spend weekends away from public glare at her home in the rural hamlet of @entity175 , east of @entity96			2
though she is often described as " boring " and has been known to give long press conferences without revealing anything of news value , her understated political persona is her strength			0
in an age where pomp and performance can seem to trump policy and substance , @entity2 is the exception to the rule			2
her shrewd negotiation skills and ability to deliver make up for what she lacks in charm and charisma			0
after all , sometimes the ability for a leader to govern is more important than the ability to warm a crowd .			0
