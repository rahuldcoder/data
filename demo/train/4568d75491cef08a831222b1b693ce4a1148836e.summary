the age of sailing ships may be over , but the romance and adventure they inspired still blows our hair back			0
this summer , majestic , one - of - a - kind tall ships may be coming to a city near you with their sails unfurled			1
in the @entity12 , captains will repeat a waterborne war that has n't been seen in 200 years			1
in @entity16 , a spectacular @entity15 vessel will join a 500th birthday celebration			1
and the @entity19 's largest tall ship festival promises a party for 200,000 visitors			1
first , let 's take a moment to appreciate the tall ships			1
these boats are run by fearless sailors who sprint hand over hand up masts that stretch 100 feet into the air			0
while the ship rolls and pitches with the wind and waves , the crew members work in unison to unfurl massive sails measuring 45 feet wide			2
in a stiff wind , these sails can pull a 400 - ton ship across the water at 20 mph			2
tall ships ruled the ocean for centuries and changed the world from flat to round			2
sadly , they also fueled the slave trade , while helping a new nation stretch from the @entity48 to the @entity49			0
today , replicas and other traditionally rigged sailing vessels reflect some of the deepest - seated aspects of @entity54 culture : independence , mobility and team work			0
they remind us that because wind power was a renewable resource , hundreds of years ago , it opened the door to global travel for the first time in human history			0
here are five events guaranteed to be a sailor 's delight this summer : 1			1
@entity71 , @entity12 region this is the captain of @entity54 sailing events			1

never before has there been a better @entity54 opportunity to get your " @entity93 " on			1
for the first time in 200 years , 17 tall ships will line up against each other and fire black gunpowder cannons to recreate the fight against the @entity99 that allowed the @entity54 to secure its current border with @entity101			2

track the ship also look for the @entity110 , a 100 - foot replica of a 19th - century privateer schooner			2
