-- the collapse of @entity3 ' $ 1bn initial public offering in @entity4 highlights the challenges facing groups that hope to list in @entity7 in the coming months			1
the high - end jeweller is the third company in the past week to pull a @entity4 ipo , after @entity10 , a copper producer , and @entity13 @entity12 , a car dealer , also scrapped deals			1
@entity16 , @entity18 's motor racing group , last night signalled a delay in its $ 3bn ipo in - @entity21 , which had been planned for next month			0
the move came days after @entity23 postponed a $ 630m ipo in the city state because of " challenging market conditions " , with global stocks falling more than 8 per cent over the past month			1
in the @entity28 , confidence in @entity9 has been badly shaken by @entity29 , whose shares have lost more than a quarter of their value since the social network raised $ 16bn from investors			0
while deals are falling apart left , right and centre , the failure of @entity3 to complete its large , high - profile @entity9 is a big blow to the @entity4 market , according to dealmakers			1
unlike recent scrapped offerings in small and unloved sectors such as resources , @entity3 was a big prospect in a hot sector			1
" this is more damaging [ than the other failed deals ] because it 's consumerism and consumer stuff had continued to perform well , " says one dealmaker			0
" it 's a real sign that the markets really are not open for deals			0
" bucking the trend , @entity55 , the @entity57 palm oil group , on thursday unveiled the prospectus for its $ 3bn listing on the @entity61 stock exchange			0
@entity3 's failure is a warning sign for companies planning to issue equity in coming weeks			1
@entity64 , author of ipo : a @entity65 , said : " such a high - profile deal being pulled will certainly mean that issuers will now be even more cautious before launching their ipos			0
" mr @entity64 added that many companies planning offerings would need to " revise their ambitions in terms of valuation " and would be advised to secure cornerstone investors and anchor orders ahead of launch			0
@entity3 did not sign up cornerstone investors for its deal			1
cornerstones are large investors who commit to buying a certain number of shares before the ipo is launched in exchange for a guaranteed allotment in the deal			0
analysts say @entity3 's shares were expensive compared with other luxury groups such as @entity91 , and that its lack of brand recognition among many investors was another problem			1
other groups " premarketing " ipos in @entity4 at the moment include @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 @entity104 says some of these deals are likely to be withdrawn or postponed unless markets recover substantially			1
in depth @entity108 , a @entity13 machinery maker , is planning a $ 2bn share sale in the city in the coming months , according to dealmakers , having scrapped a $ 3.3bn listing last september			1
some 46 companies have withdrawn or postponed ipos worth a total $ 7.7bn in @entity7 in 2012 , according to @entity115			1
@entity4 , the world 's biggest centre for listings in 2010 and 2011 , has dropped to fourth place this year , after @entity119 , @entity120 , and @entity121			2
@entity4 listings have totalled $ 3.2bn this year , according to @entity123 , compared with $ 35bn for the whole of 2011			2
investors in the city have been burnt by the poor performance of many deals over the past few years			0
shares in @entity131 , for example , have fallen almost a third since the jeweller listed in @entity4 late last year			2
@entity21 's @entity135 exchange has attracted six ipos this year including @entity137 , another @entity57 palm oil producer , and , last week , @entity139 , a construction and tunnelling company in @entity21			2
@entity143 ¶ cker , @entity135 chief executive , said : " while we do not disclose our ipo pipeline , it remains healthy and a number of companies are ready to come to the market when conditions are right			0
" after the @entity3 and @entity152 withdrawals , investors were keeping a close eye on whether @entity16 would press ahead with its planned float			2
plans last year by @entity156 to list in @entity21 were put on ice shortly after the football club notified the exchange of its intent to seek a listing , due to poor market conditions			0
