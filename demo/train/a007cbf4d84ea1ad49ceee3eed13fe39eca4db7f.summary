-- three days after a consumers ' group called for a meat boycott , the head of @entity3 's beef industry said thursday prices will fall by week 's end			1
@entity9 , president of the @entity10 , declined to say the boycott was responsible for the price drop			1
but he acknowledged that demand for beef is falling , the official @entity14 news agency said			1
" there are a sum of factors , " @entity9 told @entity14			0
" i do n't want to take importance away from the boycott , but it will be analyzed by the end of the week			2
nonetheless , we undoubtedly believe that prices reached a point that the public can not and does not want to accept			2
" on monday , an @entity3 consumer group called for a one - week beef boycott in an attempt to lower prices in a nation that eats more beef than anywhere else in the world			1
the price of beef has increased 40 percent to 50 percent since december , said the @entity36 , which called for the boycott			1
the group cited success in a similar recent boycott of tomatoes , which also had risen in price			1
within a few days of the tomato boycott , prices dropped , the consumer organization said			2
@entity9 said the beef industry had reached a particular point in which cattle growers have cheap feed but have tried to maximize their profits			0
" there has to be an equilibrium between their costs and what consumers are paying , " the industry chief said			1
@entity3 -- a nation of nearly 41 million residents and 51 million head of cattle in 2007 , the latest year comparison figures are available -- has faced a crisis as cattle supplies have dipped to their lowest levels in 45 years , according to the @entity65			0
the @entity36 cites three possible reasons for the decline in cattle stock : a significant increase in the number of slaughtered livestock ; an acceleration in the cultivation of soy , with more than 10 million hectares ( 24.7 million acres ) converted from livestock to soy production ; and more @entity3 buying beef			0
drought also has decreased the size of available pasture land			0
@entity3 eat more beef than any other nation in the world -- 68 kilograms ( 150 lbs ) per person annually , the @entity65 said			0
despite the high consumption , that 's a significant decrease from the 80 kilograms ( 176 lbs ) per person per year in the 1970s , the farmers ' group said			0
@entity3 beef is considered among the best in the world , and the nation is the third - largest exporter in the world , behind @entity96 and @entity97			0
but the drastic decline in beef cattle has led some @entity3 to worry the nation eventually could have to import beef to keep up with the high demand .			2
