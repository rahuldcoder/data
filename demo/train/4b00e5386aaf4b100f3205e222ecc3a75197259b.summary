@entity0 -- on the same day yet another death was reported in @entity5 's bird flu outbreak , the @entity2 warned the @entity7 virus was one of the most lethal that doctors and medical investigators had faced in recent years			1
" this is an unusually dangerous virus for humans , " @entity11 , @entity2 's assistant director - general for health , security and the environment told a news conference in @entity16 wednesday			1
" we think this virus is more easily transmitted from poultry to humans than @entity25 , " he added , referring to the bird flu outbreak between 2004 and 2007 that claimed 332 lives			1
" this is definitely one of the most lethal influenza viruses that we have seen so far			0
" as investigations continue into the possible sources of infection , @entity11 warned that authorities were still struggling to understand the virus			1
the @entity2 said @entity5 must brace for continued infections			2
@entity11 's warning came as @entity36 health authorities said they 've confirmed the first human case of @entity7 in @entity36 -- one they said was imported from @entity5			1
a 53 - year - old @entity36 man who worked in eastern @entity5 was confirmed to have @entity7 on wednesday , the @entity36 @entity39 said			2
his condition was described to be severe			0
he had been traveling back and forth regularly between @entity5 's @entity44 province and @entity36 , health officials said			1
" according to the case , he had not been exposed to birds and poultry during his stay in @entity49 ( in @entity44 province ) and had not consumed undercooked poultry or eggs , " the @entity36 @entity39 said			0
@entity36 health officials said they are screening travelers arriving from @entity5 for signs of @entity7			1
@entity11 , meanwhile , said @entity2 officials " are at the beginning of our understanding of this virus			2
" " ( the situation remains ) complex , difficult and it is evolving , " he said			0
so far there is no evidence of sustained human - to - human transmission , the authorities say			0
" we do want to note , however , that if limited person - to - person transmission is demonstrated in the future , this really will not be surprising , " @entity11 warned , adding that it was critical to remain vigilant , monitoring the virus 's spread and mutation			2
" we are not sure that the clusters were caused by common exposure to a source of the virus or were due to limited person - to - person transmission , " he said			0
" moreover we have not seen sustained person - to - person transmission			0
" while some elements of the outbreak have baffled investigators -- specifically why the virus tends to target an elderly demographic and the fact that it is asymptomatic or mild in some cases and lethal in others -- authorities have claimed some significant victories in the fight against a pandemic			1
@entity94 , the director of a @entity2 - collaborating research center , said researchers had seen a " dramatic slowdown " in human cases in @entity101 after the city 's live poultry market was shut on april 6			2
describing the finding as " very encouraging , " she said evidence suggests the closure of live poultry markets is an effective way to stop the spread of the virus			0
the joint inspection team from @entity5 's @entity110 and the @entity2 also found that , so far , no migratory birds have tested positive for the virus , taking another worrying route of transmission out of the equation			1
it said the @entity7 virus is only being found in chickens , ducks and pigeons at live poultry markets			0
@entity2 officials said there are already efforts underway in other countries to develop a vaccine after @entity5 officials admitted international help would be needed with this			2
