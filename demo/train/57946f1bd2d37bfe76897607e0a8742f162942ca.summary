@entity0 -- @entity3 chief @entity2 rejected allegations thursday his company behaved like a @entity7 organization over the @entity9 phone - hacking scandal			1
the accusation was put to the son of media tycoon @entity12 as he faced questions from lawmakers about what he knew and when			1
it is alleged that his company 's newspaper intercepted cellphone calls and messages of almost 5,800 royals , politicians , celebrities and business leaders -- and most controversially of all , a 13 - year - old murder victim			1
public outrage over the scandal later led @entity3 to close the best - selling tabloid in july and abandon a bid to take over @entity33 broadcaster @entity31			1
questioning @entity12 about why so little information was shared , @entity35 member of parliament @entity34 suggested the company operated an " omerta " code of silence			1
he said the " omerta " was " a group of people who are bound together by secrecy , who together pursue their group 's business objectives with no regard for the law , using intimidation , corruption and general criminality			0
" " would you agree with me that this is an accurate description of @entity3 in the @entity33 ? " @entity34 asked			2
@entity12 replied : " absolutely not , i frankly think that 's offensive and it 's not true			2
" to gasps of amazement from fellow mps on the @entity61 , @entity34 went on : " you must be the first @entity7 boss in history who did n't know he was running a criminal enterprise			2
" @entity12 rolled his eyes , before saying that comment was " inappropriate			2
" he said he " disputed vigorously " the version of events described by former @entity9 editor @entity69 and its former legal manager @entity70 , who both left the company when the tabloid was closed			0
@entity69 and @entity70 claimed they made @entity12 aware of the contents of the so - called " for @entity77 " e-mail in 2008 , indicating phone - hacking was widespread			1
the document is known as the " for @entity77 " e-mail , apparently after its intended recipient @entity79 , then @entity9 's chief reporter			0
@entity1 's @entity81 said @entity12 was caught in a " @entity83 " situation : if he was n't aware of the extent of phone - hacking when the company paid an out - of - court settlement of $ 1.2 million to one victim , he could be seen to be incompetent ; if he did know about it , it could be regarded there was a cover - up			1
@entity12 has maintained he only found about the full extent of phone - hacking by staff and investigators at @entity9 in 2010 and was not shown the e-mail			1
asked by @entity34 if he had misled the committee during his previous high - drama appearance alongside his father in july , @entity12 said : " no , i did not			1
" he added : " i believe this committee was given evidence by individuals either without full possession of the facts , or now it appears in the process of my own discovery ... it was economical			0
" asked if he was accusing @entity69 and @entity70 of misleading the committee , @entity12 replied : " certainly in the evidence they gave to you in 2011 in regard to my own knowledge , i believe it was inconsistent and not right , and i dispute it vigorously			1
" questioned about the " for @entity77 " e-mail that included transcripts of 35 hacked conversations , @entity12 denied again having seen it			0
his statement contradicted a letter @entity70 wrote to lawmakers in the summer saying he had " no doubt " @entity12 was aware of the e-mail in a meeting before he signed the check for $ 1.2 million			2
@entity12 said thursday : " i want to be very clear			0
no documents were shown to me or given to me at that meeting or prior to it			0
" taking a contrite tone , @entity12 told lawmakers that the scandal had " humbled " the whole company and that he was " very sorry " about what had happened			1
he also said the company had " moved into an aggressive defense too quickly " when some of the claims were made against it in early 2010			0
if he had known then what he knows now , he said , he would have acted differently			0
@entity12 's position at the helm of @entity3 is widely believed to have been jeopardized by the scandal , which has cost its parent company $ 150 million			1
amid the furore , the @entity138 abandoned their attempt to buy the shares they did not own in @entity33 broadcaster @entity31			0
thursday 's hearing came only days after @entity3 admitted the sunday tabloid hired a private detective to spy on lawyers defending hacking victims			2
@entity12 said he had no knowledge of the " appalling " and " unacceptable " action for which he apologized " unreservedly			0
" the phone - hacking scandal blew up in july when @entity3 admitted investigators hacked into the phone of missing teenager @entity154 , deleting messages to allow room for more			1
this gave the 13 - year - old 's family hope that she was still alive when she was already dead			0
then it was alleged families of soldiers killed in @entity164 and @entity165 as well as relatives of 9/11 victims had been targeted and police officers bribed			0
amid a storm of outrage and a boycott by advertisers , @entity9 was closed down shortly afterwards while chief executive @entity173 and long - time @entity12 aide @entity174 resigned			1
in july the @entity138 were summoned before parliament			0
at the dramatic appearance , @entity12 denied he was to blame for the scandal , but declared that this was " the most humble day of my life			0
" afterwards , @entity33 's prime minister @entity180 said @entity2 had " questions to answer in @entity185 , " after @entity69 and @entity70 accused their former boss of giving " mistaken " evidence			1
until this year , @entity3 had maintained that hacking was confined to one rogue reporter , @entity188 , and private investigator @entity187 , who were jailed in 2007 for intercepting the royal family 's phones			2
@entity1 's @entity192 contributed to this report .			0
