@entity0 , @entity1 -- there was a scene from the " @entity5 " that speaks to what happens when a leader says enough is enough and is moved to action			2
president @entity9 should step up to deal with @entity11 's aftermath , says @entity12			1
the fictitious president , @entity13 , watches from a distance as the @entity16 union and @entity17 try to reach a bargaining agreement , but nothing is happening			1
as he attends a state dinner , he calls them all to the @entity22			2
when he walks in , the bickering begins			2
after a few seconds , he essentially says , " shut up			2
you guys have messed around , and i 'm not going to have this nation paralyzed by your inaction			2
you¹re going to sit in this room until you figure it out			2
and when i return , i want to see an agreement			2
" of course , this is easier said than done , and on television , everything gets solved during a one - hour show			2
but the basic premise remains the same : when the president of the @entity39 wants to step in and make something happen , he will			1
he is the most powerful person on the planet , so what 's the problem with the @entity11 recovery effort ? @entity9 said he was going to appoint a czar over the @entity46 , and he often refers to @entity47 as being that guy , but he does n't have the power			1
in fact , rep. @entity50 , @entity51 , says he is having to use persuasive powers -- as opposed to having the statutory power -- to make it a reality			0
you ca n't cut through red tape if you do n't have a pair of scissors to do it			0
so how do we make it happen ? president @entity9 needs to stop the back and forth taking place and order @entity0 mayor @entity65 , @entity1 gov. @entity66 , certain members of @entity68 , @entity47 , and other leaders to come to @entity70 , sit down , come up with a workable plan , and get it going			1
he should say , " i do n't care how long you guys sit in this room			0
i do n't care how long it takes			0
but you are going to devise a clear and concise plan , and once you¹re done , we are going to go to the @entity79 , hold a news conference for the rest of the world to hear it and then get to work			0
" if there are onerous rules that are getting in the way of progress , give @entity47 the power to change them			0
if contractors are dragging their feet and doing shoddy work , fire them			0
stick everyone responsible for recovery in one building and say this is the nerve center and all operations are being handled here			1
it 's pathetic being down here and listening to the finger - pointing , backstabbing , accusations of ineptness on the part of the city , state and federal government			1
all i keep hearing is " we need a plan , we need a plan			0
" ask the mayor 's office and they will say , " we 've got a plan			1
" call the governor 's office and they will tell you there is a plan			1
but when you ask to see it , no one seems to be able to come up with it			0
as a result , we get spending that is out of control ; waste taking place at all levels ; money sent to the state that has n't been spent ; and the people who need the help , those who lost everything , ­ sit in limbo			0
mr. president , you 've been accused of being @entity139			1
well , act the part			0
pull a @entity139 and save the day			0
the only thing that is going to move this ball along is forceful leadership			0
and the only person who can do it is president @entity9			1
no more paralysis by analysis			1
the money to build will come from the federal government			0
the head of the federal government is the president			1
if the president truly cared , and wanted to end the bickering and inaction , he could make this happen			2
people are desperately waiting for someone , ­ anyone , ­ to step up			0
president @entity9 , you¹re the commander in chief			1
command the players to get to work			0
@entity12 is a nationally award - winning , multifaceted journalist and @entity2 contributor			1
@entity12 is studying to receive his master 's degree in @entity167 at @entity168 , and is the author of " listening to the @entity170			1
" you can read more of his columns at @entity173 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer			0

no more paralysis by analysis , @entity12 says
create a nerve center of operations for @entity11 recovery , he says
@entity12 : it 's up to president @entity9
