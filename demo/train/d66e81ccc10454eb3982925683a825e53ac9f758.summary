-- @entity1 is a funny place			1
and not just in an ironic sense			0
more funny business happens every day in the world 's entertainment capital than anywhere else			1
home of blooming talents , top headliners and celebs showing up unannounced on small stages for a quick set , @entity1 is where the country 's top comic talent gravitates to make you -- and , more importantly , that guy from @entity19 -- laugh			1
and not just at those staple industry hubs and comedy franchises you probably know about			2
@entity1 's comedy circuit radiates well beyond @entity23 and the @entity24			1
from the @entity26 to the @entity27 to @entity28 to a vaunted stage in @entity30 where a young @entity31 and some ex-weatherman named @entity33 once showed promise , these comedy venues consistently deliver hilarious goods			1
@entity36 @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 open since : 1970s @entity40 draws : from @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 to the latest @entity47 luminaries , decades of the most hallowed names in comedy have called at least one of these three hubs home			1
claim to fame : @entity1 's comedy trifecta why combine three of the country 's biggest comedy club names ( which have spawned multiple locations ) in one short writeup ? because their flagships are within a four - minute drive of each other , and even if you missed all 400 - plus episodes of " @entity37 , " or all 80 straight hours of the longest standup comedy show in history ( a benefit held at the @entity38 in 2010 featuring about 150 comics ) or the last 25 years of the " @entity65 " ( monday nights at @entity39 ) , you probably do n't need us to tell you about these places if you 're a standup fan			1
comedy history continues to be made at these three landmarks , which have drink minimums and an industry - ish vibe			1
collectively , they 've presided over @entity1 's seminal standup era in the ' 70s and all of its subsequent renaissances , while jump - starting countless comedy careers in the process			1
@entity37 , 8162 @entity23 , @entity28 ; +1 323 651 2583 the @entity38 , 8001 @entity80 , @entity1 ; +1 323 656 1336 @entity39 , 8433 @entity80 , @entity1 ; +1 323 650 6268 @entity30 the @entity81 open since : 1960 ( 1978 as a comedy - only club ) @entity40 draws : a virtual who 's who of comics over the last half century and counting -- from @entity31 , @entity44 and @entity33 to @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89			1
claim to fame : @entity92 neighborhoods			0
@entity95 parades and big college football games			0
people come to @entity30 for a variety of reasons			2
comedy would n't be one of them if not for @entity81 , a former 1960s folk music hotspot that 's dedicated itself solely to standup since the late ' 70s			2
" @entity81 is the oldest club to continuously showcase standup comedians in the @entity107 -- and probably the world , " says @entity105 , club owner for the last 36 years			2
as myriad photos and memorabilia hanging on the wall outside the showroom confirm ( including a 1979 contract for " @entity115 " [ sic ] to perform an entire week here for $ 150 ) , this place has hosted , headlined and helped launch the careers of countless performers over the years , and continues to do so			0
bonus : that cackling , middle - aged @entity123 couple beside you sharing mozzarella sticks and a bathtub - sized cocktail have no idea what either @entity126 or @entity127 stands for			0
like you , they 're just here for a good time			0
the @entity81 , 38 n. @entity132 , @entity30 ; +1 626 577 1894 @entity133 the @entity134 open since : 1978 @entity40 draws : @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138			1
occasional @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity143 drop - ins			2
claim to fame : home of weekly @entity135 shows and @entity143 's " puffy shirt			0
" a fixture in the @entity26 , @entity134 may be best known as the place where @entity135 continues to perfect his network - free standup game on sunday evenings , with tickets going on sale a few months in advance			0
but this @entity133 institution is much more than that			2
the low - key room has been a magnet for so many comic vets over the years that its famous green room graffiti ( signatures and one liners from many big names ) now extends down the back hallway			2
the club has been a who 's who of top and emerging comic talent for nearly four decades			2
weekend shows can host up to 10 performers , featuring a range of names you know or soon will , plus the odd illusionist working a set of @entity175 magic between gags			0
smart audiences here ( " are there any engineers in the crowd ? " ) lean more toward the neighboring aerospace industry than @entity28			0
bonus : the venue 's built - in showroom museum is like the @entity186 for comedy memorabilia -- from @entity189 's hat and @entity191 's duds to @entity44 's bell - bottoms , @entity194 's waitress uniform , @entity196 's " nutty professor " garb , @entity143 's puffy shirt and @entity31 ' " @entity199 " and " bicentennial man " gear			1
the @entity134 , 1018 @entity201 , @entity133 ; +1 310 372 1193 @entity202 @entity204 's @entity203 open since : 2009 @entity40 draws : @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208			1
recent drop - ins include @entity210 , @entity211 and @entity212 claim to fame : " we own comedy west of the 405			1
" hiding next to a parking garage in a back alley ( but a friendly one in beach - y @entity202 ) , the neighborhood 's top comedy venue has been swiftly outgrowing its underground vibe with frequent top tier guests , industry - sponsored shows and ( the ultimate de-radicalizer ) a recent " @entity226 " nod from @entity225			1
fortunately this growth spurt is tempered by a soulful rotation of standup , improv , sketch , confessionals and open mics ( they do it all here ) in a small room with no drink minimums ( and more than 30 beers ) where the owners still perform on thursday nights at 10 p.m. for free in @entity241			0
home to the hit improv comedy group @entity245 , the theater hosts its signature show on friday and saturday nights			0
additional comedy cred : @entity249 was born as a live show right on this small stage			2
@entity204 's @entity203 , 1323 @entity252 , @entity202 ; +1 310 451 0850 @entity28 @entity253 open since : 1988 @entity40 draws : @entity254 , @entity255 , @entity256 , @entity257 , @entity258 ( @entity259 )			0
claim to fame : " the only comedy club in @entity1 that offers a daily open mic and five - 10 minutes of stage time ! " when @entity265 is in your name , you ca n't take yourself too too seriously -- which is almost never a bad thing in the weighty , overly spotlit world of @entity1 comedy			1
the best big little comedy club in @entity271 , just up the road from that other @entity28 , this unpretentious spot is equally on and off the grid			0
weekends feature @entity276 that can reel in a killer set by @entity278			0
monday evenings host " @entity279 , " featuring some nervous , sweaty guy you definitely do n't know			0
open mics are available daily for anyone brave enough to shell out $ 5 or $ 10 for a soft drink coupon and five or 10 minutes of stage time			0
on any day , ducking past the front curtain and comedy lessons postings here will inevitably lead to some laughs , groans and the very real possibility that some famous name dropping by to test out new material on a safe , comfortable stage will bump the next 10 slots of newbies who 've been waiting all week for this moment			1
@entity253 , 5010 @entity300 , @entity28 ; +1 818 508 4995			0

there 's more top - level comedy in the world 's entertainment capital than anywhere else
famous comedians often drop into small clubs in @entity1 to test new material
the @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 make up @entity1 's comedy trifecta
but small *communities* such as @entity30 and @entity133 also host world - class comedy
