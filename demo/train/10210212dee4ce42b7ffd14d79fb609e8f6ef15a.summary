-- last week , @entity1 went on record as the first @entity4 president to support same - sex marriage , but he does n't appear ready to take his commitment beyond the endorsement stage			1
in an interview that aired tuesday on @entity10 's " @entity9 , " @entity1 would n't commit to fighting for the the repeal of the @entity12 -- a federal law that defines marriage as the legal union between one man and one woman			1
" my @entity20 has said to the courts , we do n't think the @entity12 is constitutional , " the president said			0
" this is something that historically had been determined at the state level and part of my believing ultimately that civil unions were n't sufficient			0
" but pressed further about whether he would fight to repeal @entity12 , @entity1 would only say , " @entity27 is clearly on notice that i think it 's a bad idea			2
" more than 30 states have voted in favor of constitutional amendments that defend the traditional definition of marriage as a heterosexual union			0
the president does see the issue looming large in the 2012 election			0
" this is going to be a big contrast in the campaign , because you 've got @entity46 ( @entity41 ) @entity40 saying we should actually have a constitutional amendment installing the notion that you ca n't have same - sex marriages , " @entity1 said in the interview , recorded monday			1
last week , @entity40 reaffirmed his position on gay marriage , saying marriage " should be a relationship between a man and a woman			2
" " let me make it very clear , that my preference is to have a national standard that defines marriage as a relationship between a man and a woman , " @entity40 said			2
" that would then allow states to determine what rights would be provided for people of the same gender that wanted to have a relationship			0
" while the full political implications of the president 's same - sex marriage statement remain to be seen , @entity72 released a poll friday showing 51 % of @entity4 approve of @entity1 's support for allowing gay couples to marry , while 45 % disapprove			1
the survey was conducted entirely after he announced his endorsement in an @entity83 interview on wednesday			0
and a new @entity72 poll out monday gave further details into @entity4 attitudes on the topic			0
while 50 % approve of same - sex marriage , a further breakdown of the numbers shows a significant gender gap : 56 % of women say couples of the same gender should be legally allowed to marry , while 42 % of men feel the same way			1
