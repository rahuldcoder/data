@entity0 was making her way around the @entity2 on wednesday -- a quaint , politically historic family restaurant in @entity4 -- when she got the question			1
from the back of the restaurant , a young man loudly asked when @entity0 was going to announce she was running for president			2
while the room chuckled , @entity0 looked at the chocolate bourbon pecan pie shake in her hand and blurted , " love the shake ! " after that , @entity0 paid for two shakes and some coffee ( $ 18.26 , she put the change in a donation tin on the counter ) and exited the establishment with a hearty goodbye			2
@entity0 's non-answer to the question was not surprising			1
when asked about 2016 in the past , @entity0 -- who is likely to make a presidential run but has played coy for the last year -- has done everything from shrug and walk off stage to laugh and say , " next question			1
" in this case , though , it was the question , not the answer , that was most telling			0
instead of if she 'll run , the question was framed as a certainty , like it was a forgone conclusion the former secretary of state was going to make a run at the @entity39			0
that could be felt throughout the @entity41			2
as @entity0 visited this week to campaign for rep. @entity48 , the @entity50 @entity49 hopeful , both people who support @entity0 and those who do n't said the former secretary of state 's candidacy is a foregone conclusion and that very few @entity47 look at what she is doing as anything but campaigning			1
" i 'm absolutely sure , absolutely sure , " said @entity55 , a former pipe fitter and labor member , as he stood in line to see @entity0 speak in @entity59			0
@entity55 ' opinion comes from what he said were years of watching politicians come through @entity4 and play coy about running for president			1
" it 's the politics of denial , " said @entity55 , a sen. @entity64 supporter			0
" it is a mind game			0
" @entity47 are generally more politically tuned in than most voters			0
because of the state 's place as the first - in - the - nation presidential caucus , bumping into a top flight presidential contender at a local labor hall or barbecue around caucus time is just another day for most @entity47			2
that familiarity with campaigning has caused @entity4 voters to look at what @entity0 is doing - traveling the country to support @entity50 , spending the last week of her midterm campaign in both @entity4 and @entity85 -- and think the former first lady already made up her mind			1
" i know she is running , " said @entity88 , who stood at the front of the line at one of @entity0 's events			1
" i think it was obvious years ago			0
" @entity0 did little to tamp down those beliefs while in @entity4 on wednesday , most likely because she does n't want to			1
while speaking in @entity59 , @entity0 heralded @entity4 's astute voters and the state 's focus on politics			1
" you have a lot to be proud of , " @entity0 said			0
" you test your candidates , you actually force them to be the best they can be and they have to be willing to answer the tough questions			0
" she also tailored her speech to focus on the state			0
she mentioned devastating floods that rocked @entity59 earlier in the year and thanked the state for opening " their hearts and homes " to her during her failed presidential bid in 2008			2
in addition to @entity0 's not too subtle actions , she has had help on the ground in @entity4 that has reinforced the idea she already is running			1
ready for @entity0 , the super pac urging @entity0 to run for president and organizing around her possible candidacy , has made the state a focus and put their money behind nearly the entire slate of 2014 @entity50 running in @entity4			1
to date , the group has donated $ 123,000 to @entity41 candidates , including the @entity131 , the gubernatorial hopeful who been consistently polling behind incumbent @entity133 gov. @entity133 , and all the congressional candidates ready for @entity0 also loomed large at the final @entity135 in september , where the group activated more than 100 volunteers for the event			2
what 's more , the @entity121 donated $ 5,000 to the event 's account , $ 10,000 to the @entity141 and also purchased the party 's voter file data for $ 20,000			0
ready for @entity0 's impact is also being felt by everyday @entity47 and the state 's top political operatives			1
at @entity0 's events on wednesday , women and men sport baby blue shirts emblazoned with " ready , " swag that group handed out earlier in the year			1
and to @entity155 , the former chair of the @entity141 and a @entity0 supporter , @entity144 has done a great deal to raise @entity0 's already high profile in @entity4			1
" i 'll be surprised if @entity0 does n't run , and i think she 'd be a great president			0
most @entity41 caucus - goers i talk to believe she will run and will support her if she does , " said @entity161 , who informally advises the @entity121			0
standing outside @entity0 's first event on wednesday , people chatted about @entity48 and whether they thought the @entity49 hopeful could come from behind to best his @entity168 opponent			1
but quickly , the conversation turned to @entity0			0
@entity170 of @entity171 , @entity4 turned to her friend and reflected on why @entity0 was even in @entity4			2
" even my husband asked me , ' why do you want to go see her , ' " she said to a small group of people			0
her blunt answer : " i told him , ' she is going to run for president			0

@entity0 plays coy on *discussing* a 2016 bid , but people in @entity4 assume she 's running
@entity0 made her second visit to @entity4 this fall on wednesday
@entity0 's @entity41 ground game has been helped by a @entity191 called @entity144
@entity0 will also visit @entity85 , another early presidential *primary* state
