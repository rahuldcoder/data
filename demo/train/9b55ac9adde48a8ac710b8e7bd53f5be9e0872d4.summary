-- @entity1 , the popular cloud - storage service , is investigating whether a security breach is to blame for a recent wave of spam e-mail sent to users			1
the company is investigating internally and has brought in an outside team of experts " to make sure we leave no stone unturned , " according to a post from an employee on the @entity1 forums			1
" while we have n't had any reports of unauthorized activity on @entity1 accounts , we 've taken a number of precautionary steps and continue to work around the clock to make sure your information is safe , " the post says			1
on monday , users of the forums had begun complaining about receiving a flood of spam in their e-mail			1
some of them said the e-mail address impacted is one they have only used to create their @entity1 account			0
many of the users who complained are from @entity33 and at least some of the spam messages are scams masquerading as messages from @entity33 gambling sites			1
many users also had wondered whether an hour - long outage tuesday was related to the problem			0
but in the forum post , @entity1 said the outage " was incidental and not caused by any external factor or third party			0
" it has been just over a year since a glitch briefly let people use any password they wanted to sign into any @entity1 user 's account			0
the company said that problem , which lasted for about four hours , was caused by errors in a code update			0
@entity1 has roughly 50 million users who , according to the site , upload a billion files to the service every 48 hours			2
the company has emerged as a leader in the emerging field of cloud , or web - based storage			2
the cloud is designed to save hard - drive storage space for users by instead letting them store and retrieve documents to multiple devices from remote web servers			2
that kind of remote storage is being viewed as the future of computing by companies like @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 , all of whom offer cloud - storage features			1
but it has raised the obvious concerns among some security analysts , who say remotely stored info could become a tempting target for hackers .			0
