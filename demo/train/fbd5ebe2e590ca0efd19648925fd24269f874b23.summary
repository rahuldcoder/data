-- if you woke up this morning , looked at @entity2 and wondered , " who the hell is @entity5 from @entity6 ? " you 're not alone			1
if you 've been awake for a couple hours and are still wondering why # @entity8 is trending ... please do n't ask us to explain the @entity10			1
according to @entity11 , @entity5 from @entity6 is " a hardcore pimp who recently gained fame as an @entity15 sensation for reasons beyond the comprehension of any sane person			1
" for the record , we do n't think @entity5 is actually a pimp			2
he seems to be a nice kid who works at @entity6 who became famous after @entity2 user @ brooklynjreiff posted a photo of him in his uniform on october 26			1
it was re-posted several times over the next few days , and then suddenly , as these things go , the @entity10 was hooked			1
there 's now an @entity5 from @entity27			2
and many pieces of disturbing fan fiction			2
several people have noted @entity5 from @entity6 's resemblance to @entity32 from @entity33 ( which , by the way , was a very popular @entity36 costume this year )			2
the real @entity5 from @entity6 , at least according to his @entity2 bio , is @entity2 user @ acl163			0
if the sweatshirt in his profile photo is any indication , he 's from @entity42			1
and that 's about all we know about him			0
we 'd love to know what his girlfriend -- or his mom , for that matter -- thinks of all this			0
( if you 're reading this , contact me @ jdwilson2			0
) we imagine the executives at @entity6 are already dreaming up ways to cash in on this little meme			0
but if they know anything about the teenage attention span , they know they have to work fast			0
let 's get back to work , shall we ?			0

# @entity63 became a trending topic after a photo was posted on @entity15
