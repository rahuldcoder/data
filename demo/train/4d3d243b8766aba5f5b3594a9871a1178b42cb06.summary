@entity0 , @entity1 -- for 200 years , folks in @entity0 , a small town in the @entity1 countryside , have shared the legendary tale of @entity7			1
as the story goes , @entity8 was annoyed that so few of his parishioners were attending his church 's @entity11 midnight @entity13 so the catholic priest had an idea			1
he employed a few of the town 's children to create a ruckus that would get people out of bed and into the pews			2
they threw rocks , beat sticks and awoke the town , prompting them to fill the church			1
two centuries later , on christmas eve 2010 , the ruckus remains , but the worshippers have disappeared			1
the town 's current priest , father @entity30 , stood overlooking the same house of worship -- gazing at a sanctuary completely empty of parishioners			2
outside the colonial - era church , salsa music blared			1
the actions of his predecessor have had disastrous results for @entity42			0
the type of pre-midnight @entity13 disturbances evolved over the centuries			0
large colorful floats with flashing lights were built			0
and then , of course , there were the fireworks			1
it 's the fireworks that have @entity42 worried			1
and they are not just any pyrotechnic rockets but a homemade strain -- with names like morteros , voladores and palomas -- designed to create the biggest bangs and brightest flashes and most smoke possible			1
they do n't always fly straight up			1
" its tough to be a priest and give @entity13 when there are rockets going off			1
people ca n't really enjoy the @entity70 , the birth of @entity72 , " @entity42 said , regret in his voice			0
" we 're afraid that rockets will fly into the church and kill someone			1
" @entity42 said he appreciates the effort that goes into the celebration and festivities			0
but this year , for safety reasons , he decided to cancel the @entity13 if @entity0 misses the evening services , it does n't show			1
outside the church , the town 's small plaza is nearly full of residents and visitors			1
at each corner of the town square , a large float rises three stories into the air			0
one float has an arctic theme , with carved wolves and penguins standing in fake snow			0
thousands of colored lights dot the float and illuminate the square at nightfall			0
dotting the square are food stands offering lechon , slow - cooked whole pig , its skin crunchy and colored a deep amber from hours over the coals			1
for less than a @entity109 dollar , vendors will carve off a few slices of the meat			0
although it 's still early , the square 's one bar is close to being sold out of @entity115 rum			0
about 5 p.m. , the first fireworks are being set up , and eagerness is growing for the party to begin			1
the pyrotechnics are the work of so - called artilleros , or artillery men			2
" we 've been doing this for generations and generations , " artillero @entity123 said			0
" my dad did it ; my son does ; everyone does			0
" wearing a bright orange construction helmet , @entity123 said he 's not afraid of getting hurt by the explosives			2
he offers a bottle of yellow liquid : " drink some rum , and you will be all set			0
" the first barrage of fireworks shakes the town			2
thousands of skyrockets scream into the sky , which is soon dark from smoke			0
the explosives called palomas , or doves , fly up with a stream of sparks			2
the artilleros fill lead pipes with homemade bombs that then blast forth			0
some of the firework specialists use @entity1 cigars to ignite the fireworks			1
for safety , many of them wear thick olive - green canvas shirts and small straw hats that are usually the uniform of sugar cane cutters			1
others wear only t - shirts and shorts while they play with fire			2
the fireworks shoot off in every direction , and flaming shrapnel comes falling back down to the square			2
someone ends up getting burned every year , say the locals , but there are few serious injuries			1
the only death anyone can remember was a woman killed years ago after an errant rocket flew into a building where gunpowder was stored			0
that there are no worse injuries amid the hours of explosions seems miraculous			2
but so are the festivals themselves			0
while the entire country faces crippling shortages and economic challenges , @entity0 still cobbles together everything it needs for the big spectacle			1
the parrandas bring in tourists despite the fact that the town has only one 10 - room hotel			2
@entity194 has come home to @entity0 from @entity196			1
his mother is renting out every bedroom in her house to foreign tourists			0
@entity194 said the festivals may bring in badly needed funds , but they are still put on to honor tradition			0
" we are addicted to the fire and the smoke , " @entity194 said while dodging a rocket			0
" you see that people are not from here because they cover their nose			0

huge 200 year - old @entity11 fireworks fest ignites joy in @entity0 , @entity1
*originally* , event *attracted* worshippers , but now church closes for safety
" we 're afraid that rockets will fly into the church and kill someone . "
someone gets burned every year , say locals , but there are few serious injuries
