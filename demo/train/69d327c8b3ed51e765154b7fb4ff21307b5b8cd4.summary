-- the beheadings of two @entity3 journalists and now a @entity5 aid worker have rightly prompted outrage around the world			2
although @entity10 only started to make international headlines this year , its rise has been years in the making			1
and it should not have taken anyone in the international community by surprise			2
for three years , the @entity17 did little more than pay lip service to the potential broader impact of @entity22 president @entity21 's brutal response to a peaceful civil revolt during the @entity24			2
his regime 's war on its own people resulted in the militarization of the conflict , which in turn took on a sectarian dimension			2
in @entity33 , meanwhile , the @entity17 ignored the message of @entity33 elections and threw its full support behind prime minister @entity37 , despite championing democracy			1
yet in office , @entity37 pursued exclusionary policies that left a large segment of @entity33 society feeling sidelined			2
it was this marginalization that provided @entity10 , which now calls itself the @entity44 , an opportunity to exploit the @entity47 desire for fairer representation			1
but as much as @entity10 claims to be championing @entity47 , it does not in any way represent @entity51			1
the @entity52 clearly and categorically condemns forced conversion to @entity51			1
it also accepts other religions and prophets as messengers of @entity58 , especially those of the other monotheistic religions : @entity61 and @entity62			2
what @entity10 is doing -- including its targeting of @entity64 and @entity65 -- therefore has nothing to do with practices through the ages , from the @entity69 to @entity70			1
indeed , @entity71 @entity64 have been an integral part of @entity71 history -- the presence of @entity64 in this part of the world is not an aberration , and @entity62 is as part of the history of this region as @entity51			1
sadly , @entity10 has tried to hijack @entity51 and is often wrongly labeled a @entity47 organization			1
this is unfortunate as the vast majority of @entity47 are moderates who should not be tarred with the same brush as the extremist group			1
in fact , @entity47 have largely been the main victims of @entity10 atrocities			1
in @entity22 , for example , @entity10 has often trained its fire on the moderate @entity90 rather than the forces of the @entity21 regime			1
in @entity33 , meanwhile , @entity10 has alienated those @entity47 tribes that have rejected its extremist practices , while also fighting ( predominantly @entity47 ) @entity96 forces			1
so how should the @entity17 and the countries of the @entity98 respond to the growing threat that @entity10 poses ? the reality is that force alone will not be enough to uproot @entity10 and banish the threat it poses to this region and to the rest of the world			1
instead , militias such as @entity10 -- typically based on rigid and outdated ideological beliefs -- require a multipronged approach			1
yes , military confrontation is an important tool , as is boosting economic and social development in areas affected			2
but the war on @entity10 ca n't be won unless a key reason for its emergence is not tackled : tyranny and a lack of justice			1
tyranny is another face of extremism , and it therefore makes no sense to treat it as if it is a viable alternative to radical agendas			0
with that in mind , it is high time that world leaders not just claim to cherish democracy , freedom , justice and respect of human rights while merely condemning the acts of dictators			0
empty words will do nothing to change their behavior			0
instead , the @entity17 must offer genuine support for moderate , civil opposition in @entity22 and @entity33			0
the @entity3 ' increased engagement in the region , as signaled by president @entity144 's speech last wednesday , is welcome			0
and the proposed military element -- including airstrikes -- may be successful in containing the threat @entity10 poses			1
but to truly eliminate the risk of its resurgence ( or its replacement by some other extremist group ) , the @entity17 has to be more engaged in finding lasting solutions to fundamental problems in the region			0
what are these problems ? @entity156 's occupation of @entity71 lands is one			0
another is the vindictive government policies that have left large segments of the @entity33 population frustrated , a problem that could in part be resolved by guaranteeing a true power sharing arrangement			0
finally , the @entity166 process needs to be restarted with a view to forming a transitional government with a mandate for moving toward democratic rule in @entity22			0
unfortunately , some in the @entity17 have suggested that keeping @entity21 might even be desirable , believing he is the lesser of two evils			0
this is not only preposterous , but also immoral and completely ignores the @entity22 conflict 's role in @entity10 's emergence in the first place			1
indeed , my country has firsthand experience of having to confront extremism stoked by @entity21 's regime -- back in 2007 , when i was prime minister , we discovered an extremist group called @entity51 appeared to have links to @entity22 intelligence			1
experience has shown us that dictatorships are not a sustainable guarantor of peace for minorities			0
instead , only the emergence of a democratic and modern civil state , where all individuals are treated equally , regardless of regardless of religion or ethnic grouping , can bring lasting peace and stability			0
and the @entity17 should see in this struggle not only a moral duty to act but also its own long - term interests			0
ending the @entity156 occupation through the principles of a two - state solution while backing the forces of moderation in the @entity71 world would undermine the appeal of extremists and pave the way for democratic states that foster stability			0
diversity and pluralism in nations such as @entity33 and @entity22 can be seen as either a challenge or as presenting an opportunity			0
but one thing should by now be clear to all religious and sectarian actors in the @entity69 : one group can not force its lifestyle , opinions or policies onto the other groups			2
democracy should not be used as an excuse to marginalize a minority			0
for years , @entity229 was successful in following a principle espoused by president @entity144 -- " the principle of no victor and no vanquished			2
" he is absolutely right , and governments and others in this region should listen			0
but if the @entity3 wants to see real change , then it will have to empower those moderate forces that are trying to put these fine words into action .			0

former @entity229 prime *minster* @entity244 says @entity10 rise should not have been a surprise
@entity10 claims to be championing @entity47 but does not represent @entity51 , @entity244 says
@entity244 : force alone will not be enough to uproot @entity10
