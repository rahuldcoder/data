-- today is my chemo anniversary			1
a year ago today , i started chemotherapy			1
is that something you celebrate ? is it something you even acknowledge ? i 've had mixed feelings about marking an anniversary that changed my life			1
before i was diagnosed , i was in my prime			1
i was 34 years old and undoubtedly in the best shape of my adult life			1
i had met the girl of my dreams , i was being promoted at work , and i was training for an @entity18 triathlon			1
living a healthy lifestyle is n't something that comes easily			1
it 's a choice you make -- a choice i made some years ago			1
growing up , i was an athlete , and sports were a big part of my life			1
then , in my 20s , after moving to @entity26 and making some unhealthy choices , i once again took control of my life and put my health first			1
that dying patient could have been me being healthy defined me			1
whether it was what i ate or how many times a week i exercised , it was a priority			2
it was time i dedicated to me , time that was spent bettering myself , both physically and mentally			2
and almost overnight , it was taken from me			2
being diagnosed was a big shock , not only for me but for those around me			1
if it could happen to me , someone who took their health so seriously , it could happen to anyone			2
while training for the triathlon , i was plagued with a lot of injuries that no one could really figure out			1
it was n't until i requested a ct scan on the advice of a friend that anything was detected			2
when the results from the scan came back , my doctor said it could be lymphoma or some type of infection			2
i prayed for the latter , but at that moment , i knew it was much more serious			2
diabetes took my teeth but not my life as an athlete , you know your body well , and something just did n't feel right			2
i had dealt with injuries before , but not like this			2
i met with a stomach specialist who told me it was most likely lymphoma , and the next step was a biopsy			0
i met with my oncologist , but it was n't until we got the biopsy results that i was finally diagnosed			1
i did not have lymphoma but testicular cancer , and it was spreading fast			1
i remember thinking cancer would n't affect me too much , that i 'd just have to stop every month for a week for what i called " a little chemo			1
nothing i read and nothing i was told could have prepared me for what was to come			0
@entity88 is essentially poison that kills the all the bad things in your body ; the good things are collateral damage			0
why i gave up soda i was n't prepared to feel winded after climbing a set of stairs when running 5 miles had been nothing for me			0
i was n't ready for how my hair would one day just fall from my head as if it was n't mine			0
i was n't ready for the debilitating nausea that could render me helpless			0
everything i had worked so hard for was slowly slipping away			0
i was being attacked from the inside , and i could n't control it			0
what i was first told would be a three - to four - month ordeal turned into a year			0
four rounds of chemo and two abdominal surgeries later , i 'm in the clear and could n't be happier			0
ultimately , what it all came down to was that the healthy lifestyle i had chosen aided my recovery			0
my strength allowed me to recover faster			0
just six months after my first surgery , i 'm training for a triathlon			1
so now , i start from the beginning			0
i 'm ready to live again			0
i 'm ready to be healthy again			0
my second surgery is only eight weeks behind me , and my workouts have begun			0
they 're light , but i 'm moving in the right direction			0
this will be no easy feat , but i know i 'll get there			0
i ca n't let cancer win			1
if i do n't get back to the best shape of my life , i 've let cancer off the hook			1
i intend to take back from it , what it took from me			0
i intend to cross that finish line in september			0
