@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the midst of a bloody and protracted civil war , the @entity1 government is set to hold a presidential election tuesday			1
the outcome is hardly in doubt : president @entity9 is almost guaranteed to emerge victorious in a vote that opposition groups and many @entity13 countries say will be rigged from the start			1
@entity1 is n't renowned for holding free and fair elections			1
when he came to power 14 years ago , @entity9 ran unopposed , securing more than 99 % of votes , according to state media			1
seven years later , he won again with a similarly mountainous share of the vote			2
his father , @entity20 , ruled @entity1 with an iron fist for 29 years before he died in 2000			2
some analysts say the purpose of this week 's vote , which @entity26 secretary general ban ki - moon urged the @entity1 government not to hold , is to send a message to @entity9 's opponents , both in @entity1 and abroad			1
@entity1 's presidential election : how fair can a vote be in a war zone ? ' a coronation ' " it 's a coronation of @entity9 , it 's a celebration of his ability to survive the violent storm and basically go on the offensive , " said @entity34 , a professor of international relations at the @entity36			1
the election is being held against the backdrop of a grinding three - year conflict that has killed around 150,000 people , displaced about 6.5 million people within @entity1 and prompted almost 3 million people to flee outside its borders			1
@entity50 will only take place in areas controlled by the regime			0
rebels hold significant areas of the north and east of the country			0
the @entity58 has said the vote " will be a grotesque parody of democracy			0
" the @entity62 says the @entity9 regime has taken steps " to make it difficult if not impossible to have a fair and free election in @entity1			1
" little known challengers one aspect of this year 's election distinguishes it from the previous foregone conclusions , though : @entity9 actually has people running against him -- although it 's questionable how much of a challenge they present			1
the two other candidates are relative unknowns : @entity76 , a businessman and former government minister ; and @entity79 , a lawmaker			0
critics say they are just pawns or window dressing to give the election a veneer of democracy			0
but the @entity1 government has dismissed any criticism of the process			2
@entity79 has kept a low profile , but @entity76 says he 's serious about challenging @entity9 and is " trying to attack his weaknesses			1
" he claimed he would be " more aggressive and more effective " than @entity9 on economic , administrative and social issues			2
but on the overarching question of the war , @entity94 offers no dissent			0
" politically , i think he 's doing what he has to do , " he said			0
rebels divided what @entity9 is doing is continuing the brutal offensive against those opposed to his regime , raining down barrel bombs on rebel - controlled parts of cities such as @entity109 and @entity110			1
the opposition groups fighting against him are divided , with squabbling between factions and jihadis who have flocked from around the world to try to establish an @entity117 state			0
the rebels have lost ground around @entity0 and @entity120 , and are under pressure in @entity109 and the south of the country			0
talks earlier this year mediated by the @entity26 did little to change the situation , ending with the regime and the opposition firmly opposed			2
@entity129 's office has warned that the elections are likely to worsen the situation , saying they " will damage the political process and hamper the prospects for political solution that the country so urgently needs			0
" @entity2 's @entity136 reported and wrote from @entity137			0
@entity2 's @entity138 contributed to this report .			0

" it 's a coronation of @entity9 , it 's a celebration of his ability to survive , " an analyst says
it takes place amid a three - year civil war that has killed around 150,000 people
the @entity1 opposition and *western* countries say the election wo n't be free or fair
