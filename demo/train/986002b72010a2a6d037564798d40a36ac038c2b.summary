-- prosecutors in @entity3 , @entity4 , are investigating clashes between authorities and homeless squatters in a vacant park that left three people dead and 14 others injured last week , state media reported			1
four men were still in the hospital monday -- one in serious condition -- after authorities cracked down on groups of homeless people who tried to illegally take park lands to start building houses , the state - run @entity12 news agency said			0
the clashes grew so violent that @entity4 president @entity21 sent in @entity23 troops to surround the park , where government estimates indicate more than 1,600 families are camped			1
authorities say many of the squatters are illegal immigrants , and the physical clashes have also become a tense political standoff between the federal government and city authorities in a nation that frequently attracts low - wage migrants from other @entity35 countries			2
@entity36 told reporters that many of the squatters were promised homes by the government 10 year ago , but are still searching for a solution that would give them a dignified place to live			0
" this situation is a desperate one that made us take the decision we did , " he said , adding that , " we will not leave the park until we have our housing			0
" standing beside a table displaying rocks , wooden sticks and even a gun that authorities recovered from the scene , cabinet chief @entity56 blamed the conflict on @entity3 mayor @entity58 , @entity12 reported			0
" the national government would like to publicly condemn the criminal acts of political activists , " said @entity59 , @entity4 's security and justice minister			1

but they say it is @entity58 's responsibility to resolve the problem , since a government census revealed that a large majority of residents in the park come from the city			2
