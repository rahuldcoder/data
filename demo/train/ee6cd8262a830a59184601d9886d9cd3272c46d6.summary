-- @entity1 awoke to a new reality wednesday after sweeping all three @entity4 presidential contests a day earlier , reshaping the contest that will decide who runs against president @entity7 in november			1
@entity1 won caucuses in @entity9 and @entity10 , as well as a nonbinding primary in @entity12 to energize his campaign and raise questions about front - runner @entity16 's ability to attract broad conservative support			1
the victories by @entity1 bolstered his contention that he is the strongest conservative challenger to the more moderate @entity16 for the @entity4 nomination , and the most formidable conservative candidate to take on @entity7			1
" i do n't stand here and claim to be the conservative alternative to @entity16 , " @entity1 declared to cheering supporters outside @entity23			1
" i stand here to be the conservative alternative to @entity7			2
" @entity10 was the most competitive state of the day , with @entity1 winning 40 % of the vote to 35 % for @entity16 , 13 % for former house speaker @entity29 and 12 % for @entity31 rep. @entity30			1
after a night of returns trickling in and the lead shifting between @entity1 and @entity16 , @entity35 chairman @entity34 announced live on @entity0 that @entity1 was the winner			1
in @entity9 , @entity1 got 45 % of the vote to 27 % for @entity30 , 17 % for @entity16 and 11 % for @entity37 , with 88 % of the total counted , according to the secretary of state			1
the victory in a state @entity16 won in his unsuccessful 2008 presidential bid was a strong statement by @entity1 that he represents a major conservative challenge to both @entity16 and @entity37			1
however , a low turnout in all three races signaled possible dissatisfaction among @entity4 voters with the candidates			0
all the 70 delegates available tuesday came from the @entity9 and @entity10 caucuses , while the @entity12 primary was nonbinding with no delegates at stake			1
the two caucus states did n't officially award delegates tuesday night -- that will happen down the road at district and state conventions -- but the news media , including @entity0 , will use them to make unofficial delegate count estimates			2
with 100 % of the @entity12 vote counted , @entity1 had 55 % to 25 % for @entity16 and 12 % for @entity30 , according to unofficial results			1
@entity37 did n't make the ballot in @entity12			2
such a dominating victory by the conservative @entity1 showed his appeal to @entity12 's large blocs of evangelical and tea party supporters			1
" conservatism is alive and well in @entity12 and @entity9 , " @entity1 declared before the @entity10 count had been completed			1
while tuesday was a stunningly successful night for @entity1 , it was a terrible night for @entity16 and @entity37 , who has been competing with @entity1 for the support of conservatives against the more moderate @entity16			1
@entity37 spent little time or money in the three states , instead focusing his now limping campaign on the @entity80 contests of march 6 that will be worth more than 400 delegates from 10 states			2
@entity16 , however , campaigned hard in @entity10 and to a lesser degree @entity9 , and the stinging losses cost him any momentum from his two straight victories in @entity87 and @entity88 prior to tuesday			1
a senior adviser to @entity16 signaled the campaign would take a tougher approach toward his resurgent rival and portray him as a @entity94 insider			1
" look , i just do n't think it 's a time when people are looking to @entity94 to solve problems with @entity94 , " senior @entity16 adviser @entity95 said of @entity1 , a former @entity96 senator			1
@entity95 downplayed tuesday 's results , saying : " we 'd like to win everywhere , but you ca n't			0
and we 've focused on key states for how we see a path to the nomination			0
" in @entity106 , @entity16 congratulated @entity1 for his good night before the @entity10 result was known			1
rather than continuing criticism of @entity1 , @entity16 sounded conciliatory in saying @entity4 would unite behind the eventual nominee and that he expected to be that candidate			1
perhaps in response to @entity1 's success , @entity16 struck a populist note by telling the crowd how his father never graduated college but went on to head a business and become governor of @entity119			1
" for my dad , this was the land of opportunity , " @entity16 said , later adding : " i refuse to believe @entity96 is just another place on earth with a map			2
we stand for freedom and hope and opportunity			0
" to rep. @entity130 , the @entity131 chair from @entity87 , tuesday 's results showed an underlying weakness in @entity16 's candidacy			2
" what should have been a night where he began to consolidate @entity4 support instead has shown that @entity4 are reluctant to get behind him , " @entity130 said in a statement			0
" republicans are giving the field of candidates another look , demonstrating that the more people get to know @entity16 , the less they like him			2
they know he 'll say anything to get elected , and they do n't want a candidate they ca n't trust			0
" she also cited " the lack of enthusiasm and low turnout we 're seeing in these contests , " adding that " no candidate embodies that dissatisfaction more than @entity16			2
" in @entity12 , a state official told @entity0 that the turnout would be " significantly lower than predicted			2
" the secretary of state 's office had estimated turnout would be 23 %			0
@entity16 's campaign appeared to consider @entity10 its best chance of victory tuesday			1
he canceled stops in @entity9 scheduled for monday to concentrate on @entity10 , where he spent caucus night			1
@entity16 , who won big in the state 's 2008 caucuses , has been working @entity10 since last summer and arguably has the strongest structure in the state			1
@entity1 needed victories or an overall strong showing to prove the viability of his campaign			1
" i think we need to win in the sense that we need to perform very well , " he told @entity0 's @entity175 earlier tuesday			0
@entity30 , meanwhile , predicted his focus on the caucus states would yield results			0
he spent the past week stumping in @entity10 and @entity9 , and spent tuesday night in @entity9			1
" we 're gon na win some delegates			0
whether we come in one or two or three , i do n't know exactly that , " @entity30 said on @entity0 's " @entity181			0
" " but we feel positive about moving along and picking up more delegates			0
we 'll have to wait and see			0
" @entity30 stressed his strength in the upcoming @entity186 caucuses on saturday			0
" nobody else is about to at this point jump ahead of @entity16 , " @entity30 said			2
" but we think we 're going to keep doing			0
we have a very good chance on what 's happening up in @entity186			0
" @entity37 had gotten a late start in @entity10 and @entity9 , and failed to get on the ballot in @entity12			1
the former speaker is looking ahead to @entity80 tuesday in what he hopes will be friendlier territory in his native @entity196 and other conservative states			0
as part of that strategy , @entity37 spent tuesday night in @entity200 , one of the @entity80 states			0
in an interview with @entity204 in @entity106 , @entity10 , @entity37 said @entity16 's multimillion - dollar attack campaign against him has paved the way for @entity1 to do well on tuesday			1
" the guy who has n't been attacked has gained some ground and has done a good job , worked very hard and so my prediction is when tonight 's over between @entity10 , @entity9 and @entity12 , the whole race will be muddled and @entity16 's role as the frontrunner will be deeply discounted as compared to where it was a week ago , " said @entity37 , speaking from @entity200			1
after weeks of bitter campaigning in @entity87 and @entity88 , the candidates have focused on @entity7 in recent days			0
@entity16 , @entity37 and @entity1 criticized the president over the administration 's new rules requiring all hospitals -- including those run by the @entity223 -- to provide workers health insurance that covers contraception , including sterilization , which the church opposes			1
@entity7 's re-election campaign has pushed back on @entity16 's criticism , pointing to his refusal when governor of @entity233 to exempt @entity223 hospitals from providing emergency contraception to rape victims			1
" @entity16 continues to show that he will do or say anything to get elected , " @entity7 campaign spokeswoman @entity237 said			2
" he is even attacking the president for providing women with the same access to contraception and preventive health care services that he did as governor of @entity233			0
and now , in an effort to pander to the most conservative parts of the @entity4 base , he has embraced the extreme personhood amendment , which would ban many forms of birth control , including birth control pills			0
" this sends a clear message to women across @entity96 , " @entity237 added			0
" @entity16 ca n't be trusted and his hypocrisy knows no bounds			2
" @entity37 also pounced on @entity16 's stance tuesday , telling an @entity200 crowd : " the fact is governor @entity16 insisted that @entity223 hospitals give out abortion pills against their religious belief when he was governor			2
so you have a very similar pattern again			0
over and over you get the same pattern			0
and i think a @entity233 moderate finds it very hard to draw a sharp contrast with someone who is an @entity269 radical			0
" whether @entity30 , @entity37 , or @entity1 will have the financial resources to compete with @entity16 over the long haul remains an open question			1
@entity7 's campaign , however , remains well - financed			2
in a major development for the general election , the president 's re-election team encouraged donors monday night to start raising money for a @entity131 super pac -- a reversal of his previous stance on the issue			0
@entity7 has been an outspoken critic of current campaign financing laws , most notably the 2010 @entity286 ruling that allowed the creation of super pacs			2
until now he has kept his distance from the @entity131 group , @entity290 , which has lagged behind its @entity4 counterparts in fundraising			0
" the president 's views ... have n't changed , " @entity294 spokesman @entity293 said tuesday			0
" he strongly opposed " the @entity286 ruling in 2010 and " holds those views today			0
" but " the rules are what they are , " @entity293 added			0
the president 's campaign " can not compete effectively if there are two sets of rules , " and the @entity306 " can not unilaterally disarm			2
" @entity0 's @entity307 , @entity308 , @entity309 , @entity310 , @entity311 , @entity312 and @entity313 contributed to this report			0

@entity1 wins @entity10 , along with victories in @entity12 and @entity9
@entity16 stresses party unity in congratulating @entity1
" conservatism is alive and well , " @entity1 tells supporters
the delegate total of 70 in @entity10 and @entity9 is the biggest so far of campaign
