editor 's note : @entity2 , a senior political contributor for @entity4 , is senior presidential fellow at the @entity5 for the @entity6 at @entity7			1
he was @entity8 political director for president @entity9 and chairman of the @entity11			0
@entity2 says @entity12 appeased @entity14 delegations " led by tyrants and petty dictatorships			1
" @entity17 ( @entity4 ) -- the president had his first foray into the byzantine world of @entity14 politics last week and walked away cheered on by the @entity23 crowd			0
he appeased the delegations led by tyrants and petty dictatorships by condemning president @entity25 and spelling out how his administration is going to be different			0
president @entity12 was applauded by @entity27 , @entity28 , and @entity29 ( no friends of ours ) when he said he wanted a " new era of engagement in the world			1
" are either of those three dictators going to be better world citizens or kinder , gentler leaders as a result of @entity12 's outreach ? put me in the doubtful column			1
no @entity43 president has ever stood before the @entity14 body and condemned his predecessor or @entity43 foreign policy in such a way			1
president @entity25 , like every president before him made some mistakes , but he did not deserve this put down			0
and let 's not forget @entity43 was attacked on september 11 , 2001 , and thousands of @entity43 lives were lost			1
president @entity25 and his team got us through all that and kept us safe for the rest of his terms			0
and i hope mr. @entity12 realizes the " haters " of @entity43 are still out there			1
historically , @entity43 foreign policy has been pretty consistent whether a @entity61 or @entity62 occupies the @entity63			1
president @entity12 's style may be different and more pacifying but at the end of the day he hopefully will be conducting business that benefits @entity43 interests and not the lowest common denominator interests of the @entity14 membership			1
if not , he will join his fellow @entity61 , @entity70 , as a one - termer			0
we know president @entity12 loves lofty rhetoric and he does it well			1
the public 's question should be can he deal with reality ? and can he relate that reality to us as he makes the very tough decisions he faces in the weeks and months ahead ? last thursday , the president , chairing the @entity14 @entity79 , pushed through a six - page resolution that was approved unanimously 15 - 0			1
the resolution urged a world without nuclear weapons			0
president @entity12 stated : " we must never stop until we see the day when nuclear arms have been banished from the face of the earth			1
" some may see that as an admirable goal but the hard truth is that the five permanent members of the @entity79 : @entity90 , @entity91 , the @entity92 , the @entity93 and the @entity43 all have nuclear weapons and none of them -- including the @entity43 -- are giving them up			1
they may downgrade and diminish the stockpile a little , but nobody 's going " no nuke			0
" you add the other three nuclear powers -- @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 ( although they do n't admit or deny ) -- and nobody is disarming			2
@entity92 , which along with us has the largest stockpile , could n't get out of the room fast enough before saying " not us ! " the real work of the @entity111 should have been condemning and again warning @entity112 and @entity113 that they are not welcome into the nuclear club and that every effort is going to be used to stop them from continuing on that path			2
it took @entity91 president @entity120 to call the @entity79 exercise weak and to chastise its members , including president @entity12 , for not condemning @entity113 and @entity112 more forcefully			1
" how , before the eyes of the world , could we justify meeting without tackling them ? " he went on to say : " we live in the real world , not a virtual world			0
and the real world expects us to take decisions			0
" @entity113 's reaction to their " view of the real world " was to walk away from the @entity14 meeting and test - fire missiles with sufficient range to strike @entity106 and parts of @entity139 and @entity43 bases			1
far from being humbled , a senior @entity142 official told the semi-official @entity144 news agency , " @entity113 missiles are able to target any place that threatens @entity113			0
" i for one would like to remind them that we have a lot more missiles then they have and we can strike any place they fire a missile from			0
of course , i am not a diplomat and never have been one -- for obvious reasons			0
the second exercise in reality is the very tough decision the president must make on gen. @entity162 's recommendation for more troops to get the job done in @entity165			1
gen. @entity162 is the president 's handpicked commander of forces in " the war of necessity " ( president @entity12 's term ) in @entity165			1
the acclaimed and well - respected general was allowed to pick his team and was asked in very short order to make an assessment			0
he has done that and his assessment -- as everyone else including the @entity93 and the @entity178 , who has ever gone to war in @entity165 found out -- is that the going is tough and without more troops defeat is a very real possibility			1
the president wisely is getting the best counsel possible from his foreign affairs team , an experienced group that will have many opinions as to the direction he needs to follow			2
this maybe the toughest decision of his presidency and whatever direction he takes he will be widely criticized by his friends and enemies alike			2
the important thing to remember , is this is where he needs to educate the public			2
if he expands this war , he needs a skeptical public to support him			0
if he tries an alternative to gen. @entity162 's plan , he will be judged on the end results and that may be very risky			0
you combine this with the president 's promise to close @entity209 by the end of the year , ( not going to happen ) get health care passed , eliminate ear marks ( the @entity214 defense appropriations bill has nearly 800 at a cost of $ 2.65 billion and no threat of a veto anywhere ) , and you can see a tough fall ahead			2
as if he does n't have enough on his plate , he is flying off to @entity221 to head the lobbying effort for his hometown @entity223 's final presentation to the @entity225 to host the 2016 games			2
he will once again find out if his powers of persuasion work on foreign leaders and hopefully for the hometown they will work better then they did last week			2
at least the president will quickly find out this week if he 's as good a salesman as he and his team think he is because the @entity225 makes its decision friday			0
international @entity235 politics is as tough as @entity223 politics , and being loved has nothing to do with getting results			0
the outcome will be awaited with great anticipation			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 applauded @entity12 speech
he says winning over @entity43 foes is n't an important foreign policy goal
he says @entity12 faces very tough decision on troop levels in @entity165
