editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			2
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity5 ) -- while the average @entity20 's understanding of the conflict in @entity22 is a simple , two - sided sneetch - battle between the mountainous region 's dominant @entity25 minority and oppressed @entity28 majority , the reality is a lot more convoluted than a wikipedia page or morning radio parody of the @entity32 ' " @entity33 " can accurately convey			1
in addition to the @entity25 in the north and @entity28 in the south , @entity22 is host to a pizza pie of smaller ethnic groups like @entity40 , @entity41 , and @entity42 scattered in enclaves throughout the entire country			1
during the 1998 - 1999 war , as the @entity46 and @entity48 - backed @entity47 vied with each other to see who could rack up the most atrocities , these sub-minorities were victims of a disproportionate amount of collateral brutality			2
especially the @entity22 @entity42 , more widely known as " gypsies			1
" of the 250,000 people displaced from their homes by the fighting , an estimated 90,000 were @entity42 , a figure which is a little more jarring when you realize the region 's total @entity42 population is just a little north of 100,000			0
to help them deal with the refugee problem , the @entity65 invited @entity67 , an @entity20 activist for gypsy rights , then working in @entity69 , to the city of @entity71 to act as a liaison for the burgeoning community of @entity42 's so - called @entity74			1
" the @entity65 were having gypsies running into schoolhouses seeking shelter from the @entity28 who were chasing them out of their homes , " says @entity67 from his house in @entity76			1
" and so they opened a few @entity74 camps , but they did n't know how to work with the gypsies , so they needed an expert to actually move into the camps to live with them and advise them			2
that 's what they brought me to @entity22 to do			1
" @entity67 was immediately unimpressed by the conditions at the camp he moved into an old @entity94 army barracks called @entity95			1
see the rest of the vice guide to the @entity98 at @entity5 " there were about 1,800 tents put up by the 23rd @entity101 of the @entity102			2
they were put on toxic wasteland			2
the land itself was lower than the road coming into the camp and so when it rained there was water in all the tents			2
the only food they were given was flour and beans			0
they needed water to cook with but there was no water for cooking , no water for cleaning , and when i complained to the @entity65 they said , ' well , these are gypsies , they know how to look after themselves			0
' it was a constant fight just to get them to deliver water			0
we were not guaranteed any security			0
the @entity28 were attacking the camp			0
we had children die because @entity65 police refused to take them to hospital " despite @entity67 's efforts , conditions at the @entity95 camp continued to deteriorate			2
the @entity137 regiment in charge of protecting the camp was withdrawn and children began to show symptoms of health effects from the campsite 's proximity to dumping grounds for industrial waste			0
" in 1999 , some @entity148 soldiers on patrol in @entity150 had shown symptoms of lead poisoning , " @entity67 told us			1
" so their blood was taken , and it came back they had extremely high levels of lead poisoning			1
so in the summer of 2000 , a @entity65 medical team took blood tests all over @entity71			0
they found the highest lead levels were in the gypsy camps because they had been built on the tailings stands of the mines and the pollution from the smelter drifted right over their camp			1
their blood samples were sent to a lab in @entity170 and it was found that the children in these camps had the highest lead levels in medical literature			1
" eventually @entity67 got fed up with the @entity65 's administration of the camps ( or lack thereof ) , cut his ties with the organization , and led a large group of gypsies on a protest march to the @entity184 border			1
the @entity65 responded to his accusations of negligence , saying it was investigating the matter and that they " do not think that it would be useful to discuss the matter at this time , given that the the review of this matter is ongoing			0
" we were curious how this " matter " was going , so we decided to stop by the camp and talk to some of the residents who still have n't been evacuated from the site that is killing their children			0
twelve years down the road .			0
