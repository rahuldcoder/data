two new sci - fi video games cast you in the futuristic role of a space marine who must face off against deadly creatures			1
however , while " @entity6 : extraction " and " @entity7 : @entity12 " share this theme , and are both played from an immersive first - person perspective , the two experiences are quite different			1
here 's a look at each of these entertaining , " @entity16 " - rated titles			0
" @entity7 : @entity12 " as an @entity18 ( odst ) , part of an elite group of space marines dropped into hostile areas , you land in the fictional @entity24 port city of @entity25 to ward off an invasion from the @entity27 , an alliance of militaristic alien races			1
in " @entity7 : @entity12 , " which takes place between the events of 2004 's " @entity34 " and 2007 's " @entity7 , " you play as a new character ( simply referred to as the " rookie " ) , rather than the heroic " master chief			1
" the gameplay offers a slower - paced , more urban - centered combat compared with previous adventures , and while you can play the game solo , it 's a lot more fun to invite up to three friends to play online via the @entity42 service			0
on a related note , even better than the main campaign , perhaps , is the new " firefight " mode			0
this is a cooperative multiplayer video game where up to four odst fighters can take on increasingly challenging waves of @entity27 invaders , similar to the celebrated " @entity53 " mode from " @entity52			0
" also included in the box is a second disc with three new " @entity7 " multiplayer maps , as well as all original " @entity7 " maps and downloadable map packs , totaling 24 in all			2
" @entity6 : extraction " serving as a prequel to last year 's extraordinary " @entity6 " for the @entity63 , @entity64 and pc , this new @entity61 exclusive reveals what happened leading up to @entity68 's deadly mission aboard the @entity70 mining ship in deep space			1
the action - heavy , cinematic game play takes advantage of the @entity61 's motion control , but to better handle the limited horsepower of the console , you wo n't be directly controlling your character			2
" @entity6 : extraction " is an " on - rails shooter " game , so you 'll only have control of your character 's weapon rather than his feet			1
that does n't mean you wo n't find the game fun or challenging			0
introducing new characters , weapons and enemies ( including tough boss battles ) , this atmospheric , horror - filled tale follows a group of space colonists who vow to fight a mysterious virus spreading through the @entity70 and the planet @entity99 one of the key features of this great - looking game is join - in - or - drop - out cooperative play			2
that means a friend beside you can at any time pick up a controller to help blast away " @entity111 " aliens limb by limb -- or quit the game if need be -- without disturbing the intense action .			0
