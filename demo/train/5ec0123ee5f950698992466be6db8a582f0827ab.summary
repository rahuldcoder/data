" it 's the actions , not just the assignment			0
" he said the investigation will determine whether any of those actions were illegal			0

but his office issued a written statement			0
" @entity106 is aware of the allegations in the @entity40 article and believes it is important to determine what the facts are , " the statement read , " so he fully supports @entity31 's decision to investigate this matter before drawing any conclusions			1
" the @entity42 describes the role of psychological operations as the following : " induce or reinforce foreign attitudes and behavior favorable to the @entity16 or friendly nation objectives by planning and conducting operations to convey information to foreign audiences to influence their emotions , motives , objective reasoning , and ultimately the behavior of foreign governments , organizations , groups , and individuals			1
" federal law delineates the boundaries of such operations and states they " will not target @entity16 citizens at any time , in any location globally , or under any circumstances			1
" @entity37 told @entity40 that @entity52 wanted the information operations team to provide a " deeper analysis of pressure points we could use to leverage " visiting lawmakers for increased funding			1
the magazine said that @entity52 's chief of staff also asked @entity37 how the general could secretly manipulate the lawmakers without their knowledge			2
