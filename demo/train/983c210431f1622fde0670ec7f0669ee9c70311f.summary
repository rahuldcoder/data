the @entity1 @entity0 says it 's concerned about actions taken by the @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 in recent days			1
two letters to @entity3 police chief @entity7 this week from @entity0 chastised @entity3 police over what officers were wearing -- and in some cases , not wearing			1

" officers wearing name plates while in uniform is a basic component of transparency and accountability , " @entity21 , deputy chief of the @entity22 of the @entity0 's @entity23 , said in a september 23 letter obtained by @entity25			1
" the failure to wear name plates conveys a message to the community that , through anonymity , officers may seek to act with impunity			1
" the department requires officers to wear a " name tag " with their first initial and last name on both their shirt uniform and jacket , according to the letter			2
the " i am @entity17 " bracelets are " exacerbating an already tense atmosphere between law enforcement and residents in @entity3 , " @entity46 said in a separate letter dated friday			1
" these bracelets reinforce the very ' us versus them ' mentality that many residents of @entity3 believe exist			2
" @entity46 did acknowledge the " importance of individual expression " of officers in the letter			2
@entity3 has been marred by discord and distrust of authorities -- especially among those in its large @entity66 - @entity1 community -- since the august 9 shooting of @entity69 , an 18 - year - old black teenager killed by @entity3 officer @entity17 , who is white			1
despite demands by protesters , @entity17 has not been charged in this case , though a grand jury is hearing evidence that could lead to an indictment			1
tensions in the @entity78 suburb rekindled this week after one of three memorials for @entity69 was burned			2
while many peaceful protesters took to the street tuesday night , elements within the demonstration stoked chaos , attacking police with guns , rocks and bottles and vandalizing and looting businesses , @entity81 capt. @entity80 said			1
one person threw a @entity94 cocktail at a parking structure , and there was an attempt to set a gasoline fire at a custard shop , he said			0
two officers were injured , one of whom was struck by a rock below the eye , @entity80 said			2
police chief tries to apologize emotions spiked following an appearance by @entity108 late thursday night to address the crowd and take questions from protesters			1
earlier in the day , he apologized for his department 's actions after @entity69 's shooting but pledged not to resign			2
dramatically wading into the crowd , @entity7 apologized again			0
" i 'm sorry , and i said that from my heart , " he said			0
" i had to get that off my chest			0
it 's been sitting there for two months			0
" but not everyone was anxious to hear from him			0
" if you are not resigning tonight , go home , " one man said on a bullhorn			0
" what do you want me to do ? " @entity7 asked a protester			0
" it was shortly after @entity7 agreed to walk and talk with the demonstrators that a scuffle broke out a short distance behind the chief , and officers moved in to make arrests			1
there was no indication that @entity7 was directly threatened , but he was quickly escorted inside the police department building			2
" trust -- it takes time , " @entity80 told @entity25 on friday			2
" i talked to the chief this morning			0
i think he regrets going out there last night , chief says he 's sorry @entity69 's body was n't moved sooner in a @entity25 interview , @entity7 addressed his rationale for staying on the job and not resigning			1
" this is mine , and i 'm taking ownership of it , " he told @entity25			0
@entity7 's interview with @entity25 came thursday afternoon , shortly after the release of his video apology to @entity69 's parents and the peaceful demonstrators who took to @entity3 's streets to protest @entity69 's death			1
in that video , the chief expressed regret that it took investigating officers four hours to remove @entity69 's body from the street after he was shot dead			1
" i 'm truly sorry for the loss of your son			0
i 'm also sorry that it took so long to remove @entity69 from the street , " he said in his video statement			1
investigators were doing " important work " trying to uncover the truth and collect evidence in those four hours , @entity7 said , but " it was just too long , and i 'm truly sorry for that			0
" " please know that the investigating officers meant no disrespect to the @entity69 family , to the @entity66 - @entity1 community or the people ( in the neighborhood where @entity69 was shot )			1
they were simply trying to do their jobs , " @entity7 said			0
asked thursday afternoon why the apology took so long , @entity7 told @entity25 , " there 's been so much going on , and every day there 's a different challenge			0
" he said he 's been wanting to apologize for " the time it took to remove @entity69 from the scene , " and he feels better now that he 's done it			2
" this is something that 's just been weighing on me			0
it 's something that needed to be said			0
it should 've been said a long time ago , " he told @entity25 .			0
