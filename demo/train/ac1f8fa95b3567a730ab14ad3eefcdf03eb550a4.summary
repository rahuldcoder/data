@entity0 -- the @entity5 administration made public all information available throughout the @entity8 oil spill , @entity3 press secretary @entity2 said thursday in response to a preliminary report that criticized how it handled the disaster			1
" this was an unprecedented environmental disaster met with an unprecedented federal response which prevented any of the worst - case scenarios from coming to fruition , " @entity2 told reporters when asked about the report made public the previous day			1
" when we had information , we gave it to the public			2
" according to the working paper released wednesday from the @entity21 on the @entity22 and @entity23 , the administration vastly underestimated the tens of thousands of barrels of oil pouring into the @entity8 after the april 20 oil rig explosion that caused the disaster , despite contrary information from scientists using better methodologies			1
the explosion claimed 11 lives and led to more than 60,000 barrels of oil being spewed into the @entity8 daily for almost three months			1
according to the working paper , the @entity36 squelched higher worst - case estimates accepted by government officials , preventing the public from hearing them			1
in addition , the commission staff sharply criticized later @entity3 estimates that 75 percent of the oil had been scooped up , burned or naturally dispersed , saying an operational tool -- known as the oil budget -- used by responders failed to accurately account for biodegradation and was not peer - reviewed by scientists			1
@entity2 acknowledged that some mistakes were made , in particular citing comments regarding the estimated oil dispersal by former @entity3 environmental adviser @entity52 in one of " hundreds " of interviews she gave			1
however , he insisted that the administration worked with the information available at all times , noting that it was impossible to see or measure the oil spill rate in the initial weeks after the explosion			2
" throughout this process , we got better information , " @entity2 said			2
" when the rig exploded and the blowout preventer failed 5,000 feet below the ocean , nobody could see what happened			0
" the installation of video cameras and other technology improved the ability to estimate the spill flow in ensuing months , @entity2 said			2
at the insistence of energy secretary @entity75 , the administration required @entity76 to install pressure monitors to provide the " best available data on the flow rate , " he added			0
the commission working paper said the government 's low estimates of oil flow from the spill , as well as the apparent underestimation of how much oil remained in the @entity8 , " created the impression that it was either not fully competent to handle the spill or not fully candid with the @entity91 people about the scope of the problem			1
" @entity2 echoed federal officials who say the low flow - rate estimates did not negatively affect their operations to stop the oil spill , describing the overall effort as the " most robust federal response that we 've ever seen " to such an accident			1
however , the 29 - page report said : " even if responders are correct , however , loss of the public 's trust during a disaster is not an incidental public relations problem			2
the absence of trust fuels public fears , and those fears in turn can cause major harm , whether because the public loses confidence in the federal government 's assurances that beaches or seafood are safe , or because the government 's lack of credibility makes it harder to build relationships ... that are necessary for effective response actions			2
" the report is considered a working paper			0
the commission will issue a formal report on january 12 , 2011			0
the president appointed the commission in june and tasked it with providing recommendations on how to prevent future spills and mitigate the impact of any that do occur			0
the commission is headed by former @entity138 governor and former @entity91 sen. @entity139 , a @entity140 , and former @entity142 administrator @entity141 from the @entity144 administration of president @entity145			0
rep. @entity146 , @entity147 , chairman of the @entity148 , said @entity76 was providing too - low figures for the oil flow in effort to escape liability			2
" low - balling the flow rate numbers was @entity76 's attempt to hide both the truth and their wallet from the @entity91 people , " @entity146 said			0
after the oil rig sank , the @entity158 and @entity76 initially put the spill at 1,000 barrels per day			2
the administration later derived a 5,000 - barrels - per - day estimate , depending on an " unsolicited , one - page document " based on visual operation of the speed at which the oil was leaking from the end of the riser at the bottom of the @entity8			1
despite " inaccuracies " in the @entity176 scientists ' estimate of 5,000 barrels , the government stuck with that number through may 27 , despite estimates from outside experts suggesting a much higher figure , the report said			1
the panel 's staff wrote that in some cases , nongovernment scientists relied on more refined or better - established methodologies			0
" it is possible that the early official flow estimates would have been more accurate if the government had either enlisted greater in - house scientific expertise , or enlisted outside scientific expertise by making available the data on which government estimates were based , " the report said			1
" the government appears to have taken an overly casual approach to the calculation and release of the 5,000 barrels a day estimate -- which as the only official estimate for most of may , took on great importance , " the report said			1
soon after the spill , the @entity203 and @entity76 reported a worst - case estimate of 162,000 barrels , but that was replaced by another estimate received by the @entity158 and @entity176 of 64,000 to 110,000 barrels per day			1
the actual figure turned out to be about 62,000 barrels per day			0
according to the report , @entity176 wanted to make public some of its worst - case models and requested approval from the @entity36			1
on thursday , @entity176 administrator @entity215 challenged some of the working paper 's assertions , saying the commission staff erroneously equated @entity176 's worst - case scenarios with projections of flow rates			1
the two were different , she said in a letter to the commission			0
@entity215 also said the early flow - rate estimates did not hamper the government response , and that there was no unwarranted delay or squelching of @entity176 's information by the @entity36			1
" the worst - case scenario models and documents had nothing to do with calculation of the flow rate , but they did help inform the @entity238 's preparations for possible eventualities , " her letter said			1
" and the worst - case scenario paper was made public			1
" a member of the government team assembled to address the gulf between official and independent flow - rate estimates told @entity1 , " we were never pressured [ by the government ] that we should change our [ flow rate ] number			2
" @entity249 blamed the initially low oil flow - rate estimates on the poor quality of data the group of scientists had from @entity76			2
better video and data led to the rise in the daily oil spill estimate , he said			0
the report also faulted the government 's tracking of the spill			0
it said a @entity3 official in august claimed 75 percent of the oil was " gone			1
" but the response team could not support that claim , panel staffers wrote			0
that information was never meant " to be a precise tool , " and the administration should not have used it as a scientific report , they said			0
" it did not attempt to quantify biodegradation , or the exact amounts of remaining , dissolved , and dispersed oil , which were not the targets of response action			0
" further , it said , the government 's failure to account for the stages of biodegradation increased public confusion of how much oil was actually " gone			2
" the federal government later wednesday said it acted appropriately with regard to spill estimates and the cleanup			0
" as for the predictions about the spill flow rate , senior government officials were clear with the public what the worst - case flow rate could be : in early may , [ interior ] secretary [ ken ] salazar and admiral @entity297 told the @entity91 people [ in media interviews ] that the worst case scenario could be more than 100,000 barrels a day , " said a statement from @entity36 acting director @entity290 and @entity215 of @entity176			1
" the federal government response was full force and immediate , and the response focused on state and local plans and evolved when needed , " the statement continued			0
" as directed by the president , the response was based on science , even when that pitted us against @entity76 or state and local officials , and the response pushed @entity76 every step of the way			0
finally , and most importantly , the response provided results for the people of the @entity316			0
" regarding the flow and recovery of the spilled oil , @entity290 and @entity215 said responders worked with best known information at the time and later came up with improved analysis			0
" the facts bear out that the federal response significantly mitigated the impact of the spill , " they said			0
