as politicians , pundits and the @entity3 people are focused on the escalating national crisis at the @entity5 , one excuse for the @entity5 's woes keeps surfacing			1
the @entity5 , some say , needs more money to do its job and care for veterans properly			1
but looking at the facts , that math just does not add up			0
since 2009 , @entity16 has given secretary @entity17 every penny he has said he needed to fund the @entity5 fully , resulting in an astonishing 50 % increase in the agency 's overall budget at a time when budgets everywhere else across the federal government have been squeezed , strained and slashed			2
@entity16 even exempted the @entity5 from sequestration , a win that not even the @entity27 managed to score while still engaged in a war overseas			2
@entity16 also agreed to take the extraordinary step of giving the @entity5 the annual funding it needs to cover veterans ' health care a year in advance so that the agency 's hospitals and clinics never run out of money			1
it is the reason the @entity5 's health care system continued to operate without interruption during last fall 's government shutdown , even as parks , federal buildings and congressional offices were forced to close or curtail operations for weeks			2
a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers in both the @entity48 and the @entity49 , with the strong support of virtually all veteran and military service organizations , has pushed for years to give the @entity5 the rest of its budget a year in advance , too , but the secretary and the @entity58 administration thus far have refused to endorse publicly the wisdom of protecting the entire @entity5 budget with an advance appropriation			1
our gut reaction to contemporary social and bureaucratic challenges may be to throw more money at the problem or to blame @entity16 , but this is one situation in which such simple excuses fall far short			2
a lack of resources within the @entity5 is not to blame for the failures of that department , and even if it were , the responsibility for that underfunding would lay solely at the feet of the secretary due to his inadequate budget requests , not with @entity16			0
far from being underfunded , the @entity5 is facing woes that are clearly due to a failure of planning and leadership			1
the @entity5 knew or should have known that demand for its services would swell as more troops survived the wars with more severe and chronic injuries , especially mental injuries			0
and with troop surges and drawdowns debated and planned well in advance , corresponding future demands on the @entity5 system could -- and should -- have been anticipated			1
since reports first emerged of veteran deaths during long waits and alleged mismanagement in @entity97 , there continues to be a profound and worrisome lack of thoughtful and proactive leadership coming out of the @entity5			1
instead , the @entity5 has been addressing problems in a predictable manner , first denying their existence , then downplaying the scale , then hunkering down in crisis mode and finally -- and belatedly -- coming forward with a tepid and weak public response			0
the passive , insular and arms - length management style has proven ill - suited for staying ahead of the pervasive problems of the nation 's second - largest bureaucracy			0
but more importantly , the fear is that such detached leadership from the top may have caused the @entity5 's bureaucratic and administrative pathologies to metastasize			1
our nation made a promise to the men and women who served this nation			0
tragically , the @entity5 is falling short of this fulfilling this promise			0
this time , however , we can not simply spend our way out of accountability and responsibility			0
