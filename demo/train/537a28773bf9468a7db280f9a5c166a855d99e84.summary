-- this week the world will reach 7 billion people			1
understandably that raises concern about a soaring world population			1
but there is a good news story from the demographic data that is not often told			1
we -- or rather the poor women of the world -- are defusing the population bomb			1
women today are having half as many children as their mothers and grandmothers			1
the global average is now down to 2.5 children per woman , and it continues to fall			1
this is not just a rich - world phenomenon			0
much of @entity23 now has fertility rates below two , from @entity25 and @entity26 to @entity27 , with its one - child policy , through @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and much of southern @entity33 and parts of the @entity35			0
behind the veil , the women of @entity37 have cut their fertility from eight to less than two in a generation			0
the young people out on the streets demanding democracy during the @entity45 are arguably far more politically active because they are not at home raising large families			1
falling fertility happens faster if countries get richer and if women are better educated			0
similarly urbanization helps a lot			0
while even young children can be an economic asset on an @entity57 peasant farm , they are an economic liability in cities , where they require education before they can get a job			1
the teeming megacities of the poor world may look like symbols of overpopulation , but they are part of the solution , too			0
but the real story is that rich or poor , @entity70 or @entity71 , secular or devout , socialist or capitalist , with tough government birth control policies or none , most countries tell the same story			0
small families are becoming the new norm			1
the reason , i believe , is very simple			0
women are having smaller families because for the first time in history they can			1
in the 20th century , the world largely eradicated the diseases that used to kill off most children			1
today , most kids get to grow up			0
mothers no longer need to have five or six children to ensure the next generation			1
two or three is enough , and that is what they are choosing to have			0
there are holdouts , of course			0
in much of @entity57 , rural women still typically have five children or more			1
but if @entity57 follows @entity23 , then we can see an end to population growth			1
we are , i believe , likely to see " peak population " by about mid-century			2
perhaps at around 9 billion people			2
after that , on current trends of fertility falling to below replacement levels , we will see a falling world population			2
with longer life expectancy and fewer babies , this is all but inevitable			2
@entity27 will soon be aging faster than anywhere on @entity117			0
aging is set to be the dominant demographic phenomenon of the 21st century , just as the population boom dominated the 20th century			2
what does this mean for the environment ? well , peak population is good news , of course			1
but do n't hang the flags			0
it is a pervasive myth that it is all those extra people that are wrecking the planet			0
that 's no longer the case			2
rising consumption today is a far bigger threat to the environment than a rising head - count			2
and most of that extra consumption is still happening in rich countries that have long since given up growing their populations			2
according to @entity142 , the director of the @entity143 , the world 's richest half billion people -- that 's about 7 % of the global population -- are responsible for half the world 's carbon dioxide emissions , the primary cause of man - made climate change			1
meanwhile the poorest 50 % of the world are responsible for just 7 % of emissions			2
so there is no way halting population growth in the poor world today would have more than a very marginal effect on climate change			0
it is the world 's consumption patterns we need to fix , not its reproductive habits			1
every time we talk about too many babies in @entity57 or @entity33 , we are denying this fact			0
the population bomb may be being defused by the women of the poor world			0
but the rich world has not even begun to defuse the consumption bomb			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity172 .			1

@entity172 says there 's good news attached to the 7 billion population *milestone*
he says woman are having far fewer children than their *forebears* ; global average is 2.5
he says small families new norm as old reasons for having more children are gone
@entity172 : problem now is smaller population has upped its consumption , environmental *damage*
