the fighting in @entity1 may be escalating , but hopes of a decisive breakthrough in talks and a clear and coordinated @entity7 response -- hopes raised by @entity11 chancellor @entity10 's visit to @entity12 on monday -- have been dashed , at least for now			1
intensifying clashes in eastern @entity1 following a new @entity15 - backed separatist offensive on january 13 have fueled debate over how the @entity17 and others should respond to the uptick in violence , including growing talk of the @entity17 sending weapons			1
just last week , a report by prominent former diplomats and highly respected members of the @entity17 national security establishment argued for a drastic increase in @entity17 military aid to @entity1 , including the provision of lethal weapons			1
but while @entity7 concern is understandable , @entity10 is right that the @entity17 sending weapons is not the best way forward			1
last week 's report , by eight former top @entity17 officials , urged the administration to dispatch about $ 1 billion worth of defensive military equipment to @entity1 , per year			1
it argued that @entity15 was sensitive to casualties , and that raising the costs for @entity41 militarily would alter its course in the conflict			0
yet such an approach seems built on wishful thinking			0
@entity15 would counter any @entity17 weapons sent with its own , and respond asymmetrically , escalating the conflict			0
as a result , the policy would be laid bare for what it is -- an unnecessary risk for @entity1 , one that would leave little scope for achieving peace			1
true , with support , coordination , and heavy armaments from @entity15 , the separatists have managed to push @entity1 forces north of the previous line of control , leaving @entity1 's military in a precarious position			1
and while the separatists have also taken losses , they appear to have an endless supply of tanks and mechanized equipment from @entity41			0
but a joint press conference monday between @entity10 and @entity17 president @entity69 made clear that the way forward will involve another attempt at reaching a ceasefire agreement , backed with the already enacted sanctions and economic pressure on @entity15			1
and while the president kept the option of sending lethal aid on the table , @entity10 appeared adamant that this kind of policy is unlikely ever to be realized			1
such an approach appears to reflect an understanding among @entity84 leaders that the opportunity cost of continuing this conflict could be that @entity1 misses its chance to become a developed member of the @entity84 community			2
as a result , they are unwilling to give war a chance , and @entity10 's statements simply reflect a belief that all bets are being placed on sanctions rather than a military solution as the much - needed @entity7 political and economic nation building effort continues in @entity1			1
monday 's meeting followed on the heels of @entity10 's trip to @entity41 to meet @entity15 president @entity103			2
perhaps wisely , both sides appeared to try to keep expectations low , and they were openly pessimistic about the prospect for peace as @entity15 presses for political recognition for the separatist enclaves , the withdrawal of heavy weapons , and a redrawing of the border based on separatist gains			0
@entity117 for its part has argued that autonomy should only be granted after legitimate elections are carried out in these regions , and the government refuses to recognize any territory recently lost to separatists			0
further undermining the prospects of a deal is the lack of confidence in @entity117 that @entity41 would follow through with any deal it signs , although the economic damage wrought by sanctions may be creating a genuine desire to end the conflict for @entity15 's leaders			0
@entity15 's end game -- federalization of @entity1 , autonomy for the separatists , and a permanent hook over the strategic choices the country makes -- simply can not be agreed to			2
the question is whether @entity103 will settle for something more reasonable , and sensible			0
will the sanctions currently in place be enough to pressure @entity15 's ruler into rethinking his policy in @entity1 ? some have speculated that statements last week , suggesting the @entity149 was seriously entertaining the idea of providing weapons , were actually part of a deliberate attempt to ratchet up pressure on @entity41 , even though sanctions are clearly the preferred policy			1
certainly , @entity69 's remarks monday made clear that the @entity17 is somewhat cautious over the risks of sending weapons , and he appeared to note the chain of custody risks , along with the danger of encouraging @entity1 leaders to take offensive action by sending arms			1
@entity69 also seems wary that whatever arms the @entity17 sends would be dwarfed by @entity15 's considerable conventional superiority			0
as a result , while the debate on weapons for @entity1 is not over , it appears settled for now			1
moving forward , the @entity7 should consider what could be dubbed a nonlethal - plus option -- significantly increasing nonlethal aid and doubling down on efforts at economic support for @entity1			2
in the meantime , fighting is likely to escalate in advance of any peace talks that might occur this week as both sides grapple for favorable conditions on the ground			0
with that in mind , it is hard to imagine that @entity15 forces wo n't intervene further to tilt the balance on the ground against @entity1			2
whether or not @entity41 's peace overtures are genuine -- and @entity103 seeks an eventual end to sanctions -- will become clear in the coming weeks			0
but either way , @entity1 will have to find a way forward without lethal support from the @entity7			2
this will , of course , come as a disappointment to @entity1 leaders			0
but it is hard to see how adding fuel to an already raging fire would have made an end to this conflict more likely			0
for now , sober minds have prevailed , and the @entity17 has avoided a dangerous rift with @entity11 over a policy unlikely to yield any positive results for @entity1 .			0

fighting has *flared* again in eastern @entity1
