@entity0 is a nationally syndicated columnist and a member of the editorial board of the @entity3			1
read his column here @entity0 says @entity6 's critics challenged her because of prejudices about small - town values			1
@entity9 , @entity10 ( @entity11 ) -- during the presidential election , some @entity12 demanded to know how i could defend @entity15 gov. @entity6			1
simply put , @entity6 is my people			1
she 's small - town folk who wound up in the big leagues			1
because i grew up in a small town with a population of less than 15,000 people , i was disgusted by the insults and condescension coming from those who think of themselves as the enlightened elite			1
meanwhile , in small towns , i detected great affection for @entity6			1
people talked about how she was " a real person " who " reflected their values			0
" the most significant divide in @entity37 is n't @entity38 vs. @entity38 , it 's rural vs. urban			2
the country mouse and the city mouse are still slugging it out			0
in 1982 , @entity43 mayor @entity42 ran unsuccessfully for governor of @entity43			0
some say the deciding factor was when @entity42 described life in @entity48 as " sterile " and said he dreaded living in the " small town " of @entity50 , if elected			1
that did n't play well in rural areas			0
during a recent appearance on @entity11 's " @entity55 , " @entity53 attempted an autopsy on the @entity58 's failed presidential bid			2
he went after @entity6 , accusing her of pushing the party so far to the right that it went over a cliff			1
" i think [ @entity6 ] had something of a polarizing effect when she talked about how small - town values are good , " @entity53 said			1
" well , most of us do n't live in small towns			1
and i was raised in the @entity69 , and there 's nothing wrong with my value system from the @entity69			2
" you 'd think the presidential campaign was about conservatives picking on urbanites			0
sure , some @entity58 probably made a mistake by using phrases such as " real @entity37 " or " real @entity37 " as a rallying cry for the base			0
@entity37 who live in cities might have thought they were being slighted			0
but those phrases referred as much to people 's politics and values as it did their zip code			1
i live in a city with a population of more than a million people and i never thought the @entity58 singled me out as not being a " real @entity37			0
" if anything , it appeared that big - city liberals were tapping into prejudices about small - town @entity37 to belittle the governor of @entity15 after @entity53 attacked @entity6 , one of the governor 's most vocal defenders , conservative talk show host @entity101 , returned the favor by attacking @entity53			1
" what is this hatred for conservatives and small - town people and @entity6 ? " @entity101 asked on his radio show			1
" i know a lot of people that are from the @entity69 , gen. @entity53 , and if you think the values there in the @entity69 today reflect the ones you grew up with , take a trip back and see if the street corners and the activities there are the same as when you were growing up			0
when people use phrases such as " small - town values , " it 's as much about time as it is place			1
the idea is n't that people who live in small towns have better values than people who live in cities			1
it 's simply an attempt to recall , with nostalgia , what life was like when more @entity37 lived in small towns			1
it used to be that more families ate dinner together and high school students worked summers and after school			0
it used to be that our schools did n't make excuses for why some kids do n't learn because they were too busy trying to teach them			0
it used to be that parents were n't interested in being their kids ' best friends , only good parents			0
and it used to be that people pulled their own weight and would never dare ask for a handout			0
during a recent interview with the conservative newspaper , @entity158 , @entity6 was asked if she thought her humble background accounted for some of the flak she got from the media			2
@entity6 acknowledged that she did n't come from elite stock , but said that she was grateful for that			2
" i got my education from the @entity166 because that 's what i could afford , " she said			0
" no , i do n't come from the self - proclaimed ' movers and shakers ' group and that 's fine with me			2
it 's caused me , or rather , allowed me , to work harder and pull myself up by my bootstraps without anyone else helping me			0
i think it allows me to be in touch with the vast majority of @entity37 who are in the same position that i am			0
" @entity6 understands a lot about @entity37			2
too bad many @entity37 do n't understand @entity6			2
they may get another chance to acquaint themselves with her -- in say , four years			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity186			0

@entity0 : @entity6 rose from small - town life to big - time politics
she 's been accused by @entity12 of polarizing the campaign , @entity0 says
he says she was *unfairly* targeted by liberals prejudiced against small towns
@entity0 : we can expect to hear from @entity6 again , maybe in four years
