-- the internet can get pretty overwhelming sometimes			2
if you 're like me , there are days when it feels like you ca n't stay on top of the endless stream of media			1
it seems impossible to discover the best content in all that noise			2
but today offers a rare opportunity to slow down			2
it 's a chance to reflect on 2012 's biggest news events and see some of the best first - person stories , photos and videos that came out of those moments			2
we 're revealing the 3rd @entity21 nominees -- 36 examples of citizen journalism at its finest			1
the nominated stories paint an intimate portrait of the topics and events that dominated the news cycle last year			0
a 10 - year - old boy describes what it 's like to live with autism			0
beautiful photographs capture the sense of wonder among a crowd watching a @entity38 broadcast			0
a personal essay recounts the horror of escaping the @entity42 , @entity43 , movie theater where a mass shooting took place			0
journalism has been forever changed -- i 'd argue for the better -- thanks to the fact that people can interact with media organizations and share their opinions , personal stories , and photos and videos of news as it happens			1
this year 's nominated ireports are prime examples of how participatory storytelling can positively affect the way we cover and understand the news			1
people around the world posted more than 100,000 stories on @entity67 last year			0
out of that , 10,789 were vetted for @entity0 , which means they were fact - checked and approved to be broadcast on @entity70 or featured on @entity0			1
and over the past few months , the @entity72 team and a panel of @entity0 producers sorted through all those stories to select 36 nominees in six categories : breaking news , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and , new this year , in - depth storytelling			1
finding and curating notable stories is an essential component of @entity72 's success			1
the contributions we approve on a daily basis are backed by @entity0 reporting , and we love nothing more than helping those stories reach an even wider audience			1
the @entity21 -- now in their third year -- give us a chance to celebrate those extraordinary efforts of the citizen journalists who produced them			1
this year , for the first time ever , we 'll also honor examples of standout citizen journalism and participatory storytelling that happened outside of @entity72 in a special section we 're calling excellence on the @entity104			1
those honorees will be revealed along with the @entity107 recipients on may 14			1
just as notable as the stories themselves , though , are the people behind them			0
while some of the nominees are aspiring journalists or filmmakers , many are regular people who simply felt compelled to share their stories with the world			2
they include @entity119 , an @entity120 teacher living along the @entity121 , who shared her feelings of fear and frustration after rocket attacks between the @entity127 territories and @entity128 ended a cease - fire			0
her first - person take on the conflict offers more emotion than any news report could			0
and when the @entity135 , @entity136 , school shootings left people all over the @entity139 and world struggling to find words to cope with the tragedy , @entity134 reacted through action instead			0
the retired police officer cut up his @entity146 membership card on camera , in a simple yet powerful protest			0
these are just a few of the incredible @entity151 nominated in the @entity152			0
i 'm proud to note that this year 's nominees represent some of the highest - quality stories we 've honored yet , and i look forward to continuing the tradition of celebrating standout citizen journalism in years to come			1
i hope you 'll take time today to explore the nominated stories			2
