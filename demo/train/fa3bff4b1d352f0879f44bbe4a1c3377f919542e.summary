a top congressional @entity0 is drafting alternative gun control legislation that threatens to undermine proposals now under consideration by leaders of the @entity7 's @entity6 majority			1
a spokeswoman for @entity10 's @entity9 refused to give @entity12 details of the senator 's plan			1
in the past , however , he has backed measures to deter " straw purchases " to clamp down on gun trafficking			0
he also supports new safety provisions for schools			0
@entity9 is a staunch opponent of a ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines			2
he has also expressed skepticism about new background checks -- an idea at the heart of the current congressional debate			1
" sen. @entity9 is putting together a bill to reduce gun violence without violating the constitutional rights of law - abiding citizens , " spokeswoman @entity29 told @entity12			1
" the bill is still being written , so we 're not able to share it at this time			0
" the plan being put together by @entity9 -- first reported by @entity37 -- further complicates the politics of gun control in @entity40 , where the @entity41 is extremely powerful			1
@entity42 : ' shame on us ' if @entity43 does n't bring new gun laws president @entity42 pushed new gun control legislation near the top of the legislative priority list in the wake of december 's school massacre in @entity43 , @entity50 , where 20 first - graders were killed			1
but @entity6 are struggling to find the 60 votes needed to push any new measures through the 100 - member @entity7			0
alternative legislation from @entity9 could provide cover for moderate @entity6 from more conservative states looking to back some sort of bill not vehemently opposed by the @entity41 or other political heavyweights			1
it could also help firm up @entity0 opposition to more expansive legislation including background checks			1
addressing gun control supporters at a @entity66 event on thursday , @entity42 accused gun rights activists of playing a crass game of political obstruction			1
" there are some powerful voices on the other side who are interested in running out the clock , or changing the subject , " the president said			0
" their assumption is that people will just forget about it " as @entity43 recedes further into the past			0
if that happens , said @entity42 , then " shame on us			0
" opinion : did we learn nothing from @entity43 ? the list of proposals backed by the president in the aftermath of @entity43 includes expanded background checks , tougher laws against gun trafficking and straw purchases , and improving safety at schools			2
@entity42 also supports a renewal of the assault weapons ban , though that provision has been virtually abandoned by senate majority leader @entity99 , @entity100			0
the president on thursday rejected arguments by opponents of the legislation that the measures under consideration by @entity6 -- including background checks -- would strip @entity108 of their constitutional right to bear arms			1
" what we 're proposing is not radical			0
it 's not taking away anyone 's gun rights , " @entity42 said			2
@entity40 should n't get " squishy because time has passed and maybe ( the issue 's ) not on the news every day			2
" but much of what @entity42 considers " squishy " is seen by senators like @entity9 as a principled defense of basic freedoms			2
" throughout history , governments have wanted to shut up those who would criticize government , to suppress unpopular religions , or to disarm people , " @entity9 declared at a january 30 @entity123 hearing			0
" the constitution for 225 years has established a government that is the servant of the people , not the master , " he said			0
as " we consider and debate legislation arising ( @entity43 and other ) tragedies , i hope that we will proceed with proper understanding of the relationship that the @entity130 establishes between government power and individual liberty			0
" polls suggest @entity40 might have waited too long on gun control			1
