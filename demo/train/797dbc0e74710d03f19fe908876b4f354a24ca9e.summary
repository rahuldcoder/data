-- @entity2 , anytime you sat down to watch a wedding movie , you had a good idea what you were going to get , whether it be " @entity7 " or " @entity8			1
" all of that changed with the surprise box office success of " bridesmaids , " a raucous , raunchy comedy that launched @entity13 ( and co-star @entity14 ) into @entity16 's stratosphere			1
fresh off the success of " @entity18 " earlier this year , @entity14 is back again as an unconventional , unpredictable , anything - but - by - the - book police officer in " @entity21 , " which reunites her with " bridesmaids " director @entity22			1
the film , in theaters on friday , co-stars @entity26 ( who has done her own wedding movie , " the proposal " ) , and the two of them are an extremely rare thing to see on the big screen : two female cops			1
over the years , we 've seen any number of " buddy cop " movies ( see the gallery above ) , but they 've almost exclusively been about two men ( " @entity40 " is even referenced by name in the movie )			1
once again , @entity22 and @entity14 are tweaking an established movie genre			1
@entity0 recently spoke with @entity22 about the new movie , and what genre he hopes to tackle next			1
@entity0 : what attracted you to the script ? @entity22 : i wanted to do a follow - up to " bridesmaids " in the same tone that allowed me to do the same style of comedy i wanted to do , and i wanted to work with funny women again			1
this thing just showed up at my house one day , a script was sent to me			0
it was called " the @entity61			0
" that 's about as perfect as it gets ! i 'd always wanted to do action comedy			2
it just felt like the perfect mesh of the kind of movie i wanted to do , and getting to do it with funny women			1
i was reading it on a plane , laughing the whole time			0
i heard that @entity26 was interested in one of the roles , which was exciting			0
i 'd always wanted to work with her			0
the minute i started to read it , it was obvious the other role was so perfect for @entity14			1
it came together fast -- eight weeks after i read the script , we were shooting the movie			2
box office battle : ' @entity21 ' vs. ' @entity84 ' @entity0 : so you had @entity14 in mind right away ? @entity22 : we tried to figure out something to do together after " bridesmaids			1
" i was really bummed when she got hired on " @entity18			0
" i was sad because i wanted to make a movie with her that summer			2
two weeks after she left to make " @entity18 , " that script came in			0
i went into overdrive and called her people -- i had to make it happen			0
we actually jammed all her stuff with @entity26 into a five or six week period , before she had to return to " @entity101			0
" then we shot @entity26 's solo stuff			0
@entity14 had to fly back and forth the last three weeks to shoot with us			1
she was absolutely exhausted at the end , but you ca n't tell on screen			2
@entity0 : how did @entity26 fit into that dynamic on set ? @entity22 : first of all , she 's a great comedy fan and a talented actress -- having won an @entity111 and all that			1
she had n't done a lot of improv , and we like to play loose on our set			2
she got into it pretty quickly			0
in rehearsal and improv sessions with her and @entity14 , we got to see her instincts for playing the character , and adjust the script so she slipped pretty easily into that character			1
this was like doing an exhibition match between two of the world 's greatest tennis players , thinking : ' wow , they do n't miss , ' wondering how long this can go on			2
i just sat on the set , saying : ' wow , this is cool , ' and got out of their way			0
@entity0 : you 've done the teen show ( @entity22 created the cult series " @entity141 " ) and the wedding movie , and now you have the buddy cop movie			1
have you always tried to tweak established genres ? @entity22 : i like familiar genres -- storytelling is really all about execution			1
i 'm not a guy who 's like , ' i want to come up with this amazing thing that no one 's ever seen			0
' i like the comfort of a familiar story because then you can play within it and surprise people with the way you do it			0
@entity0 : what did you see in previous buddy cop films that you wanted to play with here ? @entity22 : @entity159 ( @entity160 , the screenwriter ) was originally inspired by movies like " @entity162 , " where these guys riding around with hot girls on the back of their mopeds -- thinking : ' that 's not fair , why ca n't women have that kind of life ? ' at the same time , she wrote it from a woman 's perspective			1
what i like is how germane it is to two women at a workplace			2
what we did n't want was a movie with two guys and saying : ' let 's put two women in here			1
' we did n't want women acting like guys			2
what drew me to this was two ultra-professional women who were good at their jobs and loved their jobs , and because of that , they have n't compromised in any other area of their life			2
so they need a friend -- i like stories about smart , professional women			2
my wife has at times struggled to find a true best female friend			2
the idea of trying to find a perfect friend is a pretty universal idea			0
review : ' @entity21 ' @entity0 : every so often , someone ( most recently , @entity202 ) will make a statement that women can not or should not do comedy			1
what do you say to that ? @entity22 : it 's the most ridiculous statement you can make in the world , about that			1
it 's obviously made by people who do n't hang out with funny women			1
all i 've known in my life are women who make me laugh			0
women very often make me laugh more than men			0
women 's comedy is n't as aggressive as a comedy of men -- which can be a lot of insults , put - downs and verbal punching of each other			1
that stuff 's very funny -- " this is the @entity230 " is one of the funniest movies i 've ever seen , i love that stuff			0
but it 's just not where my skill set is -- i 'm much more feminine in my comedic likes and dislikes			0
i had a lot of bullies growing up , and i was always running to my female friends and thinking let 's just make each other laugh and ignore those guys @entity0 : there was a recent controversy about a @entity244 poster for the movie , which apparently photoshopped @entity14 's image			1
any thoughts on that ? @entity22 : i have very little to do with the marketing and even less to do with the international marketing			2
it 's a drag because i love @entity14 the way she is , so that 's the only way i ever want to see her			2
@entity0 : will " @entity141 " or " bridesmaids " fans see any familiar faces in " @entity21 ? " @entity22 : @entity256 , who played " coach @entity257 " will pop up in the film and he 's so great			1
" stove , " the air marshal has a small cameo , which made me very happy			0
i really tried to stack this with people i 've worked with			0
@entity264 from " @entity265 " is there , and @entity267 from " @entity268 " has a very funny scene at the beginning			0
@entity0 : what 's next for you ? @entity22 : i wrote this female spy comedy , sort of a female @entity275 thing that i 'm putting together right now			1
i 'm just trying to figure out who our cast is			0
i 'm hoping that 's the next thing i do , but i 'm also developing more things			0
i 've got a deal with @entity282 developing movies for them which is really exciting			0
hopefully most of it will be with strong female leads because i love working with the funny ladies			1
i 'll try to keep that up as much as i can .			0

after *redefining* the wedding movie with " bridesmaids , " director @entity22 is back with " @entity21 , " a female buddy cop comedy
@entity14 reunites with @entity22
@entity22 calls statements that women are n't funny " ridiculous "
next up , @entity22 is working on a " female @entity275 " movie
