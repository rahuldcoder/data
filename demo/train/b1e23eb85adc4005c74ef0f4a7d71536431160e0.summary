-- @entity1 continues to dominate in the battle to be the top smartphone system in the world , thanks in part to @entity7 , which reigned as the top phone manufacturer for 2012			1
@entity1 grew its already significant chunk of the smartphone market to 68.8 % last year , while @entity13 's @entity12 operating system stayed comfortably in second place with 18.8 % of smartphone shipments , according to new stats from research firm @entity17			1
together , the two operating systems accounted for 87.6 % of all new smartphones in 2012 , leaving struggling competitors @entity21 and @entity22 far behind			2
it 's no surprise that @entity1 has surged so far ahead of @entity12			0
there are are thousands of @entity1 handset models in every size and at every price imaginable , while @entity13 has released only six versions of the @entity29			1
@entity13 sold 130 million smartphones last year , according to @entity31			0

@entity13 released one new @entity12 phone in 2012 , the much - anticipated @entity29			1
however , according to @entity31 it was previous @entity29 models , which dropped in price enough to make them a more appealing option in emerging markets , that accounted for much of @entity13 's smartphone success			1
even though @entity13 's sales are growing , @entity17 points out that its year - over - year growth is actually slower when compared with the rest of the smartphone market			2

@entity21 just released its long - awaited new smartphone operating system and two new handsets in january , and @entity70 debuted its @entity63 update at the end of 2012			1
@entity21 must persuade its existing users to make the upgrade and win back some large companies , which were previously its biggest customers			2
unlike @entity21 , @entity63 unveiled its new products and marketing campaign early enough to make some progress last year			1

@entity21 plummeted 36.4 % from the previous year , but we 'll have to wait and see how its latest products do in the fresh year			0
