@entity0 may have some leadership vacancies			2
the reported deaths of two of its most effective , wealthy and ruthless commanders within just a few days would be a major blow to the group that has invested heavily in establishing a stronghold in @entity9 , beyond the reach of that country 's weak government and army			2
on saturday , @entity14 said its troops deployed in the remote @entity17 mountains in north - eastern @entity9 had destroyed a jihadist base and killed a number of terrorists , including their leader @entity21			1
two days earlier another prominent jihadist -- @entity23 -- was reported killed in the same area			1
the @entity14 president @entity25 and a @entity27 official subsequently confirmed his death , but the @entity29 have not			1
so far only the @entity14 have reported the death of @entity21			1
but @entity29 officials confirm heavy fighting continues in the area where he was reported killed , and have disclosed that a @entity29 soldier has been killed in the operation			1
if both @entity23 and @entity21 have been killed " it would be big news , " according to @entity39 , a @entity40 - based analyst who recently spent time in @entity9 , and has long followed the evolution of @entity0			1
" it would mean the removal of two very experienced senior commanders , " he told @entity43			0
the @entity47 are an impenetrable range of peaks , ravines and caves with virtually no human presence beyond the nomadic @entity54 people -- a @entity56 tribe that raises goats , camels and sheep			0
@entity21 and @entity23 , while frequently bitter rivals , had both established camps in the @entity47 as a precaution against international efforts to rid northern @entity9 of @entity66 militants			1
last week , @entity29 military spokesman col. @entity67 said the militants were " sustained in a region they know very well			1
they have set up defensive underground positions , that their members can move between , and they have prepositioned weapons and food depots , " he said			2
a year in control a year ago , as the @entity80 army and government collapsed in the face of a revolt in the north led by @entity56 separatists , the @entity77 affiliate and other militant groups had moved into the major towns of the north - effectively splitting @entity9 in two			1
@entity23 had established himself in the fabled city of @entity88 , introducing @entity90 law , banning music and forcing women to wear the full veil in public			1
@entity21 was seen in and around the town of @entity96 further east			1
both men are -- or were -- @entity98 , but had seized new opportunities in northern @entity9 , enriching themselves with smuggling and kidnapping operations , and taking advantage of their intimate knowledge of the desolate geography of the region			0
@entity23 's group is thought to be still holding four @entity29 hostages kidnapped from a uranium mine in neighboring @entity110 in 2010			1
@entity21 had reportedly made millions of dollars from smuggling between @entity9 , @entity98 and @entity111 -- as well as ransoming westerners his group had captured			1
he was also behind the attack on the @entity116 gas plant in southern @entity98 in january , in which more than thirty foreign workers were killed			2
the @entity29 military intervention in @entity9 began days before that attack , and was subsequently supported by troops from several west @entity121 states			1
as @entity29 forces pushed north and jihadist bases were bombed from the air , hundreds of militants retreated into the desert and mountains			1
and in the weeks since , much of the military action -- including airstrikes by the @entity29 and joint @entity29 - @entity14 deployments on the ground -- has been in and around the @entity132			1
some 1,200 @entity29 and 800 @entity14 soldiers have been sent to the area , gradually tightening the noose on jihadist fighters who had not disarmed and melted into the general population			1
@entity14 special forces , under the command of the president 's son , have proved themselves effective in the difficult terrain -- no doubt helped by plenty of practice against rebels in remote parts of their own country			0
( @entity14 militia also dealt @entity111 forces a resounding defeat in the 1986 after @entity151 tried to seize a border area			0
) one @entity29 official told @entity43 last month that the @entity14 were regarded as the most useful of the west @entity121 contingents , which number some 3,000 troops			1
but @entity14 's forces have also taken heavy losses in the @entity47 campaign			2
on friday , the bodies of 26 @entity14 soldiers were returned to the capital in a ceremony attended by president @entity163			0
leadership vacuum neither @entity21 nor @entity23 sat at the top of @entity0 's hierarchy in @entity167 but they became the two most powerful @entity77 figures in the @entity170			1
both commanded potent " @entity172 " or brigades of fighters intensely loyal to them			0
@entity175 was promoted to a deputy leadership position in the @entity177 several years ago by @entity0 's emir @entity178 out of concern that @entity21 was growing too strong			1
the @entity181 countries of @entity9 , @entity182 and @entity110 became the new center of gravity for @entity0 as @entity98 security forces degraded the group in its traditional heartland			0
@entity188 - isolated and marginalized - struggled to exert control over his southern commanders			0
in an effort to restore his influence , @entity178 appointed a loyalist -- @entity195 ( also known as @entity196 ) -- as the overall commander of @entity0 in the @entity177 last autumn			0
he also sent an envoy to northern @entity9 to announce that @entity21 had been relieved of his command			1
but although @entity201 was a ten year veteran of jihad , he is from the north of @entity98 and according to analysts has wielded nothing like the influence of @entity207 or @entity23 , who counted criminal kingpins , corrupt politicians and military officers among their contacts			1
@entity201 was designated as a terrorist leader by the @entity213 two weeks ago			0
it said that previous to his appointment as the @entity177 emir " @entity196 led another @entity0 element whose members operated in @entity9			0
in that capacity , he participated in several attacks launched on behalf of @entity0 in @entity221			0
" " as of late 2011 , @entity201 reportedly had possession of multiple @entity225 hostages , " the designation added			0
@entity226 responded to his effective " firing " by @entity188 by setting up a new commando unit called " we sign with @entity229			0
" one of his close associates said he was setting up his own franchise of @entity77 which would report directly to @entity77 leader @entity232			2
he vowed attacks against @entity235 interests if the international community moved against jihadists in northern @entity9			2
before the bloody conclusion of the siege at @entity116 , he recorded a tape demanding the release of two prominent jihadists from @entity27 prisons			2
it appeared to be a calculated bid to raise his profile and popularity amongst jihadists worldwide -- and a shot across the bows of @entity188			2
the operation was not without cost for @entity21			2
several of his most experienced deputies were killed in the attack			2
analysts tell @entity43 he either felt strong enough to risk losing them or the stakes were such that the operation was a necessity			0
@entity262 hostage attack was launched across from @entity111			0
both @entity21 and @entity23 made trips to @entity111 after the fall of @entity151 and established a network of contacts there			1
if they have been killed , analysts say it will set back @entity0 's ambitions in @entity111			1
@entity39 told @entity43 that if both senior commanders have been killed it will likely set back efforts by jihadists to wage a campaign of guerrilla warfare against the @entity29 and their allies			1
but recognizing the scale of the mission to restore @entity9 's territorial integrity , @entity29 officials have indicated that some troops would stay in the country at least until july			2
@entity29 had been hoping to withdraw the majority this month			2
and it 's clear that @entity66 groups are far from raising the white flag in parts of northern @entity9			0
another faction - the @entity288 or @entity288 - remains active around @entity96 , where there have been several suicide bombings			0
the local government headquarters was seized by militants for several hours on february 21st , provoking a long gun battle with @entity29 and @entity80 troops			2
the fighting virtually destroyed the town 's market			0
@entity288 appears to have had close ties to @entity207			0
and @entity301 leader @entity300 -- leader of the group @entity302 -- also remains at large			0
if @entity226 and @entity304 are gone , there may be one compensation for @entity0			0
@entity178 and his deputy @entity306 may be able to wrestle back control of @entity77 operations in the @entity177			1
in a letter @entity178 wrote last year and which was found by the @entity312 in @entity88 last month , @entity0 's leader criticized his subordinates in northern @entity9 for trying to introduce @entity66 law too quickly in the region and for imposing harsh punishments which he said jeopardized their whole project			0
" your officials need to control themselves , " he wrote			0
" it is very probable , perhaps certain , that a military intervention will occur ... which in the end will either force us to retreat to our rear bases or will provoke the people against us , " he wrote			0
now he has to deal with the consequences of @entity0 's over-reach in @entity9 .			0

if both @entity23 and @entity21 have been killed " it would be big news , " analyst says
they became the two most powerful @entity77 figures in the @entity170
if confirmed , their deaths would likely set back efforts by jihadists to wage a campaign of guerrilla warfare against the @entity29
