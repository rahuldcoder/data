@entity0 , @entity1 -- the president of @entity4 has admitted that he lied about gender tests on runner @entity6 before her gold - medal win at the @entity8 last month			1
@entity6 celebrates her gold at the world championships in @entity11			1
the national sports body has always denied that it agreed to the tests before the race in @entity11 , @entity15 -- an event that kicked off international controversy over the 18 - year - old @entity6 's gender			1
but after @entity1 's @entity21 newspaper printed e-mails on friday showing that @entity24 president @entity23 was aware of the tests , he held a news conference to apologize			1
" i now realize that it was an error of judgment and i would like to apologize unconditionally , " @entity23 said on saturday , according to @entity1 's @entity28 news agency			2
after receiving the results of the tests , the @entity1 team doctor requested the 18 - year - old @entity6 be withdrawn from the 800 - meter race she ended up winning , @entity23 said			1
but @entity23 said he refused to do it because the sport 's international governing body did not request withdrawal			1
he also said withdrawing @entity6 might have looked bad			2
" if we did not let her run , we would be confirming that she is not normal , " @entity23 told the news conference in the capital , @entity0			2
the e-mails printed by the @entity21 are an exchange between team doctor @entity45 and @entity24 general manager @entity46 , with @entity23 copied in			1
" after thinking about the current confidential matter i would suggest that we make the following decisions , " @entity45 wrote on august 5 , more than a week before the @entity11 race			1
we get a ( gynecological ) opinion and take it to @entity11			0
we do nothing and i will handle these issues if they come up in @entity11			0
please think and get back to me asap			0
" an e-mail response from @entity54 to @entity45 , sent the same day , says : " i will suggest that you go ahead with the necessary tests that the @entity57 might need			0
" the controversy over @entity6 erupted after she crushed her rivals in the 800 meters and secured victory in one minute , 55.45 seconds -- the best women 's time in the world this year			1
@entity6 's masculine build and dominant performance fueled existing questions about her gender , and the @entity57 -- which oversees the sport worldwide -- ordered tests on her			1
reports in two newspapers last week said the results of the tests showed @entity6 has both male and female characteristics			1
the @entity57 declined to confirm those reports and said a decision in the case would come in late november			0
the @entity57 said it sought tests on @entity6 's gender before the @entity11 championships because questions had been raised after her winning performance at the @entity84 junior championships in july			1
@entity1 have rallied behind @entity6 , angrily dismissing reports about her gender			2
@entity6 's relatives and the @entity1 team manager have maintained she is female			2
this week , @entity1 's minister for women , children and people with disabilities wrote to the @entity93 to complain that @entity6 had not been treated in line with international protocols on gender and quality			2
@entity98 sent a letter to the @entity93 @entity100 , urging it to investigate , @entity28 reported			0
" the questioning of her gender is based on a stereotypic view of the physical features and abilities attributable to women , " she wrote in the letter , according to @entity28			0
" such stereotypes demonstrate the extent of patriarchy within the world 's sporting community			0
" the process of gender verification has undergone big changes since it was first introduced for international competition in the 1960s , the @entity57 said			0
the first mechanism involved " rather crude and perhaps humiliating physical examinations , " which soon gave way to mouth swabs to collect chromosomes			0
there were too many uncertainties with mouth swabs , so the @entity57 abandoned them in 1991 and the @entity125 discontinued them in 2000			0
a proper test has yet to be found , the @entity57 said , and the current tests are considered a good interim solution .			0
