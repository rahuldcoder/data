" our committee has established that @entity1 provided false information to @entity2 in early 2006 , " @entity8 said in a written statement			1
" we want to clarify how that happened , and to hold the company to account for its actions both before and after its testimony proved untrue			0
and we want to examine what steps the company has taken since then to protect the privacy rights of its users in @entity6			0
" the newspaper reporter had posted information under a pseudonym on an overseas web site called @entity45 about a government crackdown on media and democracy activists , @entity8 said			1
@entity22 was later arrested in his home in @entity50 after @entity1 gave @entity6 authorities information about his e-mail account , his computer address , his log - on history and the contents of several weeks of his e-mail , @entity8 said			1
@entity8 said a @entity1 official testified last year that the company knew nothing " about the nature of the investigation " of @entity22 , a pro-democracy activist now serving time on what @entity8 called " trumped - up charges			2
" " we have now learned there is much more to the story than @entity1 let on , and a @entity6 government document that @entity1 had in their possession at the time of the hearing left little doubt of the government 's intentions , " said @entity65 rep. @entity65 of @entity66			1
" @entity77 companies must hold the line and not work hand in glove with the secret police			0

" this new documentation suggests that @entity1 's @entity50 office was at least aware of the general nature of the crime being investigated in the @entity7 case , " said @entity112 , manager of research and publications for the @entity103			2
even if @entity1 was unaware of the specific circumstances of the @entity6 government 's inquiry , " one does not have to be an expert in @entity6 law to know that ' state secrets ' charges have often been used to punish political dissent in @entity6 , " said @entity112			1
