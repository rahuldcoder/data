-- both president @entity1 and @entity2 flubbed the big question on jobs at tuesday night 's debate			1
moderator @entity6 noted that @entity7 makes its iphones and @entity9 in @entity10 and asked , " how do you convince a great @entity13 company to bring that manufacturing back here ? " @entity2 talked about reducing corporate taxes , getting tough with @entity10 by making it " play by the rules , " and stopping its currency manipulation			1
@entity1 said that some jobs are just never going to come back because the labor wages abroad are so much lower than in @entity13			1
what the president wants to do is to double @entity13 exports and create new high - wage jobs to replace the low - wage jobs that have been sent offshore			1
obviously , neither debater knows the details of how the dynamics of trade and globalization work			1
why @entity7 will never bring manufacturing jobs back to the @entity13 for starters , the iphones and @entity9 are not really made in @entity10			1
they are only assembled there			0
according to the @entity37 , the assembly accounts for $ 6.50 of the final $ 178.96 wholesale cost of an @entity39			2
researchers at the @entity41 estimate the assembly value of a $ 500 @entity9 at about $ 12			0
the major value of these devices is in the semiconductors , electronic displays and other key components			1
these high - technology and high - capital components are largely made in @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , and to a lesser extent @entity54			1
a few are even made in @entity13			2
none of these are low - wage countries			1
@entity50 and @entity54 , in fact , are high - wage countries			1
the labor component of making these parts is quite small			0
what about taxes ? @entity50 's 39.5 % corporate income tax rate topped the 39.2 % of the @entity13 until it was dropped to 38.01 % earlier this year			2
so it 's not exactly a tax haven or low tax jurisdiction			0
nevertheless , @entity50 's computer chip and electronic display makers are major suppliers of components to the @entity39 and @entity9 as well as to the whole range of competing phones , tablets and computers			1
furthermore , @entity7 and many global electronics companies are already paying less taxes by dint of elaborate accounting schemes that funnel revenue to tax havens like @entity82 , the @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85			0
as for @entity10 's practice of currency manipulation , it has been an irritant , but not an insurmountable one			0
technically at odds with international trade and monetary rules , the @entity10 government has intervened frequently in currency markets to keep the dollar strong and the yuan weak by buying dollars			0
more recently , @entity10 has allowed the yuan to rise closer to market rates , although many analysts believe it is still undervalued because present rates do not fully reflect increases in @entity10 productivity			0
@entity2 may thus be justified in his critique			0
the risks of doing business in @entity10 must also be taken into consideration			0
in the past two weeks , we have seen @entity50 factories in @entity10 trashed by mobs in the wake of a dispute between @entity50 and @entity10 over who owns a few specks of rocky islets in the @entity113			0
even if @entity10 labor is cheap , incidents like these can be costly			0
the real reason that these kinds of jobs are n't coming back is that @entity13 producers no longer know how to produce many of these product components			1
there is no significant @entity13 producer of flat panel electronic displays			2
and @entity13 semiconductor makers have continually been losing to competitors like @entity51 's @entity128 and @entity52 's @entity129			2
the jobs involved in the production of these components are exactly the high - wage , high - benefit jobs @entity1 said he wants to create			1
the only way to get them back is for the @entity13 to regain the strong position it once occupied in making things			2
@entity1 seems to be edging in this direction with his call for spurring manufacturing			0
but a @entity13 production renaissance will require a lot more than the president 's piecemeal approach so far			2
it means we need a comprehensive competitiveness strategy similar to those now pursued by @entity51 , @entity54 , @entity52 , @entity50 , @entity82 , @entity10 and others			0
it is not written that @entity13 must suffer a drain of ever more highly skilled jobs to overseas locations			1
to halt this dynamic , we must fight fire with fire			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity159 .			2

@entity159 : debate shows neither *candidate* understands details of global trade dynamics
@entity166 : the major value of @entity39 is in the semiconductors and other key parts
he says @entity13 producers do n't know how to make these key components *anymore*
@entity166 : if we want high - wage jobs in the @entity13 , we need a competitive strategy
