-- as high - tech reality tv goes , it 's hard to top sunday 's riveting leap from the stratosphere by @entity6 daredevil @entity5			1
it took courage and skill , to be sure			0
but the technology required to get a guy well on his way to outer space , then allow him to plummet safely back to @entity14 , deserves some credit , too			1
from the one - of - a - kind @entity18 capsule to a pressurized space suit engineered specifically for the jump to a " smart " parachute designed to deploy if @entity5 had spiraled out of control , the jump debuted tech that organizers say could contribute to the science world in other areas			1
after space jump , what 's the next big stunt ? here is a look at some of the most interesting gadgetry used during the record - breaking leap : the capsule at 2,900 pounds , the @entity18 weighs in at slightly more than a modern @entity36			1
it 's made of a fiberglass and epoxy " pressure sphere , " the same kind of steel alloy ( chromium - molybdenum ) cage used in racecars , a foam - insulated fiberglass shield that protected @entity5 from temperatures as low as -70 degrees @entity46 and a base covered in " crush pads " designed to handle 8 gs of impact pressure			1
the suit engineers on the project say @entity5 's spacesuit - style uniform could serve as a model for the future of space travel and exploration			1
the fully pressurized suit was tested to withstand temperatures as high as 100 degrees @entity46 and , more importantly in @entity5 's case , as low as -90 degrees @entity46			1
why was the 3.5 pounds of pressure in the suit important ? because , according to the @entity18 team , tissues in @entity5 's body could have turned to gas and expanded while he was above 62,000 feet			1
the most innovative aspects of the suit , however , might have been those designed for mobility and vision			1
a skydiver needs the ability to move around more quickly than , say , an astronaut tethered to the outside of the international space station			0
the @entity18 suit was modified to allow more mobility and a system of mirrors increased visibility			1
a hockey puck - sized controller is programmed to adjust pressure based on the suit 's current altitude and a new kind of rotating , locking ring attached the helmet and gloves to the rest of the suit			2
@entity5 's helmet was an 8 - pound composite mold attached to a pair of oxygen cylinders during his descent			1
its visor was equipped with an integrated heating unit to prevent fogging and icing			0
chest pack the nerve center of @entity5 's gear was a chest pack where most of the high - tech gadgetry he 'd need to complete , and document , the jump was stored			2
data recorders inside it reported his altitude , speed and location to mission control to help them monitor his progress and whereabouts			0
the pack also contained a @entity120 beacon to make him easier to find			2
the voice transmitter and receiver that connected to his helmet were in the chest pack , as was an hd camera with a 120 - degree view			0
cameras that chest pack camera was n't the only one devoted to documenting the historic leap			0
still and video cameras were designed specifically for the mission by @entity132 of @entity133			0
@entity132 is one of a handful of photographers with experience shooting in zero - gravity , including a shoot with @entity140 astronaut @entity139			0
there were nine high - definition cameras in the capsule , three high - resolution still cameras and three digital cinematography cameras with lens resolution of 4,000 x 2,000 - pixels			2
in addition to @entity5 's chest - pack camera , he also had one attached to each thigh			2
the cameras were modified in a host of the ways for the unique needs of the mission -- from pressurized casings filled with nitrogen to protect them from the extreme temperatures to special filters to protect them from the brightness of the sun at that altitude ( @entity168 5 owners take note )			2
parachute the parachute itself was a tech marvel five years in the making			0
the first personal parachute ever used for a supersonic - speed fall , it weighs 60 pounds , or three times as much as a normal parachute			0
it included a " drogue chute " that could have deployed if @entity5 began spinning out of control			1
he had a button on one of his gloves that would have caused the chute to open if he held it down for three seconds			0
that parachute ( which is separate from the regular emergency chute ) also would have deployed if it was being hit by unexpectedly high levels of pressure for more than six seconds			0
his rig also included a button to cut the emergency parachute			0
while it would just be an inconvenience for many skydivers , if @entity5 's emergency chute accidentally deployed at a high altitude , it could have slowed him down so much that he ran out of oxygen			2
sticking the landing how was @entity5 able to control where he landed ? for starters , the skydiver remained within the @entity14 's atmosphere , so he never had to account for the planet rotating underneath him			1
his team waited for ideal weather conditions , when there were fewer high - altitude winds that might have caused his balloon to drift			0
and once he deployed his parachute , less than two miles above the @entity14 , @entity5 was able to steer himself to a flat , open landing spot in the @entity214 desert -- some 23 miles east of where the balloon had taken off several hours earlier			1
a beacon inside his suit allowed his recovery helicopter to follow him .			0
