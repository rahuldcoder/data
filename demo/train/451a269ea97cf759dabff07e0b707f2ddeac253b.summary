@entity0 , @entity1 -- " i 'm an engineer , so we do n't talk emotions too much			2
" those were the words of capt. @entity7 of the @entity8 shortly after the @entity10 defense vessel @entity9 had discovered a series of pings in the southern @entity13			2
perhaps he did n't want to discuss his feelings			2
but he had a twinkle in his eye , a bit of what he called " cautious optimism			2
" i 've seen that same glimmer shining through on the faces of dozens of others involved in the arduous search for @entity24			1
it 's been there through each new lead , and even through some of the setbacks			2
the search for the missing @entity31 has gone on for eight weeks now			1
we 've all had to learn a new technical language : from @entity35 satellite data and the " @entity36 , " to the @entity37 and @entity38 - 21			0
we 've heard countless theories about where the plane might have gone and who might have been flying it			0
both the science and the science fiction have , at times , almost drowned out what this search is about at its core : solving the mystery of what happened to the 239 men , women , and children who were on board @entity24			1
closure it takes people to find clues and to follow the trail of where they lead			1
people who are working tirelessly across borders and time zones , putting their lives on hold with the aim of bringing even the smallest bit of closure to the families of those who have been lost , and to prevent their nightmare from ever happening again			1
some , like capt. @entity7 , might humbly say that they 're just doing their jobs			0
others remain anonymous , like the international team in @entity76 , who did much to give the search a tangible focus , even if that focus has shifted several times			1
i 've been covering the missing flight for @entity2 for more than 50 days in @entity83 and @entity1			1
i ca n't pretend that what i do compares with the dedication of the hundreds of service members from @entity87 to @entity88 , who have flown tirelessly day after day over millions of square kilometers of the @entity13			0
i ca n't pretend that i understand the pain of @entity92 , who lost his 29 - year - old son , or @entity94 , whose husband , @entity95 , disappeared on the way to start a new job in @entity98			0
but as a journalist , i 've felt at least a small part of their confusion and frustration			1
i recall the difficulty in getting a candid response from @entity83 authorities in the early days of the search -- the way they sidestepped almost all tough questions during that first week after the plane vanished			1
i remember the @entity87 family members who were brave enough to try to take their quest for answers public and were dragged out of the press room in @entity76 , screaming and crying			0
thinking about their grief , the expressions on their faces that afternoon , still hits me hard			0
human spirit there have also been moments that have made me proud to be telling this story -- moments that have to do with the human spirit			0
the card from a 7 - year - old on the @entity127 inside @entity128 , which said she was ready to greet the @entity24 passengers as soon as they landed safely			1
the moment i saw the pinger locator and @entity38 robotic submarine on the dock at @entity135 in @entity1 , i felt a sense of awe and honor standing just steps away from keys that still have the potential to unlock this puzzle			0
and the moment search chief @entity141 told the world " i 'm now optimistic that we will find the aircraft ... in the not too distant future			1
but we have n't found it yet because this is a very challenging business			0
" a voice of reassurance and reason , even if the challenge soon outweighed the optimism			0
over the past eight weeks , i 've witnessed something			1
it was in the words of the housekeeper who answered the front door at captain @entity161 's house in the @entity76 suburbs			0
it was in in the wake of the @entity9 as it pulled away from the dock at @entity166 and made speed for the search area			2
it was there when i sat a few feet away from the @entity172 ceo on day 4 , and it was there when i spoke to captain @entity7 around day 44			0
just a few days ago , i felt it again , when i returned to @entity176 @entity175 outside @entity0			0
as i stepped onto the tarmac , i recalled the first time i 'd done so , more than a month earlier , to welcome back one of our reporters after she 'd taken part in an 11 - hour search flight			2
solving the mystery almost 350 flights later , the massive air search was over with no trace of @entity24			1
planes from seven countries were lined up in formation at @entity176			0
flight crews from @entity1 to @entity83 to @entity192 traded stories , reflecting on the moments behind them , before pausing to recognize the task that still lies ahead			0
i remember what a young @entity198 pilot who flew on the @entity200 search plane told me : that his greatest disappointment after weeks of looking out over the vast open ocean was not being able to give the families what they needed the most			1
and that if he could continue the search , he would , until the day he found something			2
after all these weeks , it 's a feeling that remains strong as ever -- the hope and the belief that we may eventually be able to solve this mystery , and that the families of 239 passengers and crew will one day have the answer to a crucial question : why ?			1

the search for the missing @entity31 has gone on for eight weeks now
no closer to solving mystery of what happened to the 239 men , women , and children
despite frustration , searchers remain determined to bring closure to relatives of passengers
