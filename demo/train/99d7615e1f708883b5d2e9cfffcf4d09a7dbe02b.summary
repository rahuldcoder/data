see what new techniques and ingredients @entity3 now uses in his cooking on his new upwave show " @entity7 , " premiering december 1 on @entity6			1
( @entity10 ) -- " trying to get me to cry by looking at this ugly picture ? there are worse ones ... " that 's how @entity3 reacts to a photo taken 10 years ago , when @entity3 was almost 60 pounds overweight -- and 60 pounds heavier than he is today			1
" i just really lost control of myself because i was tasting food all day long and partaking in the social aspect of our industry , " @entity3 , 41 , tells @entity6			1
the acclaimed chef -- " top chef : all - stars " winner , the owner of @entity24 and operator of @entity27 - based restaurants @entity28 and @entity29 -- lost all that weight and kept it off , he says , by overhauling his lifestyle			1
watch : @entity3 , in control working in the restaurant industry makes it easy to overindulge , he says			1
imagine working a 16 - to 17 - hour day , tasting food all day long , cooking , talking about food , being on your feet all day but not getting any actual exercise , and just wanting a beer after a mentally draining shift			0
" you get off work , it 's one in the morning , you go out , talk shop , and you end up eating a whole pizza or ( drinking ) a whole bottle of wine , " he says			2
" you do that 60 or 70 days in a row , and i put myself in really bad shape			0
" in a matter of months , @entity3 ballooned to about 225 pounds			1
@entity53 sparks a change of heart -- and mindset @entity3 says his " @entity57 ! " moment came when he could no longer recognize himself in the mirror			1
" i do n't know that i could see my toes if i looked down , " he says			0
but there was another factor motivating @entity3 to shed pounds			1
" what kick - started my weight loss was a combination of a really joyous thing and some massive depression : i lost a restaurant , and i found the love of my life -- my wife			1
" @entity3 gives @entity64 a lot of credit for his transformation			1
a competition junkie and a former personal trainer , she was ( and still is ) supportive and understanding ; she kept him motivated on his weight - loss journey			1
they started running together , and today , the once - hefty chef has completed several half and full marathons			2
" i had to get this pretty girl			0
i was this chubby guy , and i literally had to run after this girl , " @entity3 says			1
" she 'd run two miles , i 'd be sucking wind behind her , but i eventually caught ( up to ) her and proposed to her at the end of my first race -- a @entity89 , the @entity90			0
and we 're still together			0
" for @entity3 , exercise took priority ; healthier eating and , eventually , cooking came a little later			1
he " stopped eating and drinking so much in a social setting , " which he says was easy for him			0
eventually he started using healthy ingredients , such as raw oats , hemp seeds , goji berries , and cocoa nibs , which he now incorporates into his cooking at home and at his restaurants			2
@entity6 : ' top chef ' cooks up heart - healthy meals " chefs are notorious for disregarding eating healthy , " @entity3 says			1
" when we hear things like gluten - free , we rebel against that			0
" now he says he understands the value of being aware of and embracing people 's dietary needs			2
" i feel like we have a public service as chefs in restaurants to provide people not only delicious food and a great experience , but also nutrition , " @entity3 says			1
" when you can coax flavor out of healthy ingredients and not have to rely on some of the traditional ways of making food delicious , it makes the experience better because you walk out of that restaurant and you feel good about yourself			0
" the secret to tasty & nutritious dishes @entity3 says the secret to making food healthy and delicious is " understanding base flavors " and " knowing what the dish you 're trying to make healthier needs : is it fat ? is it salt ? is it acidity ? " if you want to avoid using salt , @entity3 recommends adding spinach or celery , which have natural sodium in them			1
if you want the flavor of fat without the calories , go for mushrooms , he says			0
to make the patty for the @entity155 + turf burger at @entity29 , @entity3 mixes mushrooms in with the beef , for example			1
" those mushrooms actually give the burger a sense of fat , but there 's no fat in it			2
" when cooking at home , @entity3 tries to get his two daughters , ages 5 and 3 , involved in the kitchen as much as possible			1
" kids will eat anything that they make themselves , " he says			0
" just like if they made a picture for you , they 're proud to show that to you			0
when they 're in the kitchen , even if it 's just kind of fake - stirring something , they 'll eat it			2
that 's how you get your kids to eat brussels sprouts ! " @entity6 : easy @entity188 recipes from @entity3 @entity190 sprouts , spinach and mushroom burgers sound great in theory , but @entity3 says even the most strong - willed of us ca n't keep that up every day			1
" i do n't stay away from eating bad food -- just balance			0
as a professional chef , i 'm watching how much i 'm tasting during the day			0
portion control for me is a big deal , " he tells @entity6			0
and , of course , you ca n't skip the gym , even after you 've achieved your weight loss goals			1
" it 's so hard to lose weight or to be healthy if you 're not combining eating well with moving your body , " he says			2
" i do n't think one can exist without the other			0
" @entity3 says a variety of exercises keeps him healthy today			2
besides running , he has recently started swimming and is considering training for a triathlon			0
he says the key to sticking with exercise is finding something that does n't feel like work			0
" when i 'm cooking , i do n't feel like i have a job -- i just cook because i love to do it			0
when i run , i just do it because i love to do it , " @entity3 says			2
" so you 've got to find that fitness activity that you love so much that it does n't feel like you 're going out of your way to do a job			0
" @entity6 : chef @entity3 on @entity228 snacks it took @entity3 almost a decade to get in shape ( " it 's got to be low and slow , like a good braised osso buco " ) , but he finally feels good in his body			1
most importantly , he now feels in control again			0
" it 's ok to have a cheeseburger ; it 's ok to eat food , but it 's important to have a healthy relationship with the food you eat			0
" do you have a weight - loss success story to share ? tell us how you did it and you could be featured on @entity247 .			2

@entity3 used to weigh 225 pounds ; now he 's at *165*
@entity3 won " top chef : @entity252 " and operates two restaurants in @entity27
@entity3 credits his weight loss to his wife , who is a former personal trainer
