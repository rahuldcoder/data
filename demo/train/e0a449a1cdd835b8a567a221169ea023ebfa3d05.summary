@entity0 , @entity1 -- there were few answers sunday about the fate of @entity6 , a day after contact was lost with the commercial jetliner en route from @entity0 to @entity10			0
an aerial search resumed at first light , with aircraft searching an area of the @entity17 for any sign of where the flight may have gone down , @entity11 , the director general of civil aviation in @entity1 , told reporters " we have not been able to locate anything , see anything , " @entity11 said			1
" there 's nothing new to report			1
" the closest things to clues in the search for the missing jetliner are oil slicks in the @entity32 , about 90 miles south of @entity34 's @entity33 -- the same area where the flight disappeared from radar early saturday morning			1
a @entity34 reconnaissance plane , part of a massive , multinational search effort , spotted the oil slicks that stretch between six and nine miles , the @entity34 government 's official news agency reported			1
@entity1 authorities have not yet confirmed the @entity34 report , @entity11 said			1
the reported oil discovery has only added to a growing list of questions about the fate of the plane carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew members : what happened to the plane , why was no distress signal issued , and who exactly was aboard ? passenger manifest questioned bits and pieces of information have begun to form , but it remains unclear how they fit into the bigger picture , if at all			1
for instance , after the airline released a manifest , @entity60 denied that one of its citizens was aboard the flight			1
the @entity60 citizen was safe and sound , and his passport had been stolen two years ago , @entity68 spokesman @entity67 said			1
similarly , @entity72 's foreign ministry confirmed none of its citizens were on flight 370 , even though an @entity72 was listed on the manifest			1
on saturday , @entity72 police visited the home of the parents of @entity78 , the man whose name appeared on the manifest , to inform them about the missing flight , said a police official in @entity82 , in northern @entity72			2
@entity78 's father , @entity83 , told police he had just spoken to his son , who was fine and not on the missing flight , said the official , who is not authsorized to speak to the media			1
@entity78 was vacationing in @entity88 , his father said			1
the police official said @entity78 had reported his passport stolen in @entity1 last august and had obtained a new one			1
but @entity92 law enforcement sources told @entity2 that both the @entity60 and @entity72 passports were stolen in @entity88			1
" no nexus to terrorism yet , " a @entity92 intelligence official said , " although that 's by no means definitive			1
" @entity1 authorities have been in contact with counterterrorism organizations about possible passport issues , @entity1 's transportation minister @entity99 said			2
he did not state how many passport issues there are , saying authorities are looking at the whole manifest			0
the @entity92 government has been briefed on the stolen passports and reviewed the names of the passengers in question but found nothing at this point to indicate foul play , said a @entity92 law enforcement official , who spoke on condition of anonymity			1
of the two passports in question , the @entity72 one had been reported stolen and was in @entity124 's database , @entity2 law enforcement analyst @entity122 said , citing sources at @entity124			1
additionally , no inquiry was made by @entity127 to determine if any passengers on the flight were traveling on stolen passports , he said			1
many airlines do not check the database , he said			2
during the news conference in @entity0 , @entity11 declined to say whether the airline or @entity1 authorities had checked the database			1
not ruling anything out @entity1 authorities reiterated during a news conference that they are not ruling anything out regarding the missing aircraft			0
the @entity140 departed @entity141 at 12:41 a.m. saturday in good weather , and it was expected to land in @entity10 at 6:30 a.m. , a 2,300 - mile ( 3,700 - kilometer ) trip			0
air traffic controllers in @entity145 , outside @entity0 , lost contact with the plane about 1:30 a.m. , @entity11 said			0
earlier , the airline said the jetliner lost contact at 2:40 a.m. the pilots did not indicate to the tower there may be a problem , and no distress signal was issued , the airline said			2
it may be days , possibly weeks or months , before authorities can offer any firm answers			0
it took five days for authorities to locate the wreckage of @entity163 when it crashed june 1 , 2009 , in the @entity164 , killing all 228 on board			2
it took four searches over the course of nearly two years to locate the bulk of @entity163 's wreckage and the majority of the bodies in a mountain range deep under the ocean			1
if @entity6 went down in the @entity32 , the recovery may be a bit easier because it is a relatively shallow area of the @entity17 , according to marine officials			1
@entity99 , who in addition to being @entity1 's acting transportation minister is also its defense minister , said that the search area has been expanded because of the possibility the plane had turned back			2
@entity184 , @entity34 , @entity185 and @entity1 were conducting search and rescue operations south of @entity33 island in the @entity17 , according to the airline and reports from @entity191 , @entity184 's official news agency			1
ships , helicopters and airplanes are being utilized			0
the @entity196 , a destroyer conducting training in the @entity17 , is being routed to the southern @entity34 coast to aid in the search , the @entity195 said			1
the @entity92 is also sending a @entity202 surveillance plane from @entity203 to provide long - range search , radar and communications capabilities , the @entity195 said			1
meanwhile , the @entity207 has ordered on - duty vessels to aid in the search , @entity191 reported , citing government officials			0

because of the @entity92 aboard the flight , the @entity218 has offered to send a team of agents to @entity1 to support the investigation into the disappearance if asked , a @entity92 official familiar with the issue told @entity2 on condition of anonymity			1
earlier , an official had said @entity218 agents were heading to the area			2
the @entity218 is not ruling out terrorism or any other issue as a possible cause in the jetliner 's disappearance , the official said			1
officials appeared resigned to accepting the worst outcome			0
