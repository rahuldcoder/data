-- images beamed around the world last week of unruly and provocative protests by indigenous australians projected a portrait of an angry and disenfranchised group			1
the protesters thumped on the windows of a restaurant where prime minister @entity10 had been attending a ceremony , prompting security officers to rush her out of the building			0
they also burned the @entity16 flag in front of @entity18			1
those actions have provoked alarm and introspection in @entity16 about the relationship of the indigenous population with society as a whole			1
and they have stirred controversy at a delicate time : the country is considering the possibility of changing the wording of its @entity32 to give better recognition to indigenous @entity35			2
the protests also gave a misleading impression of the complex role @entity39 play in @entity16 society			1
many commentators -- both @entity42 and @entity43 -- have been quick to stress that the protests involved a small number of people and do not represent the views of the broader indigenous @entity16 population of about half a million people			1
" the @entity39 that i recognized in the television reportage of the protests do n't really have a role in the @entity35 community. , " said @entity49 , the head of @entity16 indigenous studies at the @entity52			1
" they 're the disaffected fringe			0
they have no serious platform or serious demands			0
" the protesters were part of a long - running @entity35 demonstration known as the " tent embassy , " which was set up 40 years ago to protest the failure of the government at the time to recognize @entity35 land rights			0
some of the protesters also reportedly expressed anger last week about the violence and discrimination toward aborigines that marked a large portion of @entity16 history			1
the @entity16 authorities have taken steps to try to address their grievances in recent decades through measures like legal recognition of land rights , the removal of sections considered racist from the @entity32 and an apology for the mistreatment of past generations of @entity39			1
governments have also poured billions of dollars of public money into programs to try to improve life in indigenous communities			2
despite those measures , many indigenous australians still lag behind the overall population in key areas like health , wealth and education			1
they also appear to perceive a lack of trust in their relationship with their non-aboriginal countrymen			0
@entity35 , who make up less than 2.5 % of the overall population , are much more likely to suffer child abuse , physical violence and chronic disease than other @entity35 , according to government statistics			2
research suggests they have a lower life expectancy than indigenous populations in @entity111 and @entity112			2
" past approaches to remedying @entity39 disadvantage have clearly failed , and new approaches are needed for the future , " said a government report made public last year			1
the report said that the 3.5 billion @entity16 dollars , or $ 3.75 billion , spent annually on programs for indigenous people had " yielded dismally poor returns			1
" a survey of 1,220 @entity35 carried out in 2010 by @entity123 , which promotes the improving of relationships between @entity39 and the wider community , found that 85 % of indigenous people polled had " fairly low " or " very low " levels of trust toward other @entity35			1
and 91 % of the indigenous respondents said they believed that other @entity35 had " fairly low " or " very low " levels of trust toward them			2
similarly , high levels of non-aboriginal @entity35 also saw the relationships as distrustful , according to the survey			0
some observers , however , say that to speak of indigenous @entity35 simply as a disadvantaged people separate from the broader society is neither accurate nor helpful			1
" aboriginal people are not a homogeneous cultural group anymore " said @entity137 , an anthropologist and linguist at the @entity139 and the @entity140			2
he noted that while some indigenous @entity35 live in remote communities that maintain aspects of traditional life , others make up a large and growing middle class in more urban areas			2
" many @entity35 people drive good cars and have children at university			0
these are not people in the gutter , they 've made it , " said @entity153 , whose book " @entity155 " examined the failings of past efforts to tackle indigenous disadvantage			2
to illustrate the blurring of the boundaries , @entity153 highlighted @entity16 census data that showed the proportion of indigenous people whose partners or spouses were recorded as non-indigenous has been increasing steadily , from 46 % in 1986 to 71.5 % in 2006			1
despite this nuanced situation , the striking images of the protests last week , which took place during the sensitive period around @entity16 's national day , brought underlying tensions to the fore			1
the events " opened up fissures in our society and taught us lessons that stretch far beyond the crucial issue of indigenous affairs , " the @entity16 , a national daily , said in an editorial at the weekend			1
on @entity186 and in letters to newspapers , @entity35 argued over the causes and consequences of the fracas			0
some people criticized @entity193 , the opposition leader whose comments about the tent embassy were cited by protesters as the provocation for their actions			0
others , such as @entity200 in a letter published by the @entity16 , expressed outrage over what he called the " disgraceful behavior " of the protesters			2
the news that one of @entity10 's media advisers was involved in informing the protesters about @entity193 's comments and presence in the restaurant with the prime minister only served to intensify the polemic			0
the adviser , @entity216 , has since resigned			0
the rancorous debate reflected battle lines that had already been drawn			0
" the indigenous affairs scene is this country has become much more riven , much more conflictual and much more polarized in recent years , " @entity153 said			2
he said the disagreements are not simply between @entity39 and @entity223 , but between different sides within the indigenous community and among groups outside it			1
several commentators noted that a considerable number of the people participating in the protests last week were not @entity39			1
much of the contention focuses on the diagnosis of the ills affecting parts of the @entity35 community , and on how best to cure them			0
certain policies , like the federal government 's decision in 2007 to intervene in @entity35 communities in the @entity242 to address child abuse , have proved particularly divisive			0
the intervention included seizures of @entity35 land , restrictions on alcohol and the suspension of race discrimination legislation			0
some prominent indigenous australians , such as @entity252 , have campaigned vigorously against the intervention , saying it misrepresents the real situation in @entity35 communities and is a form of " dictatorship " by the central government others , such as @entity49 , have supported it , arguing that the social problems that many communities face necessitate the strong measures			1
" there are very difficult problems to solve , " @entity49 said			0
" a big part of the change must come from @entity35 people themselves			0
they have to change their behavior to take advantage of the opportunities available to them , like sending children to school every day			0
" one of the most immediate concerns after the protests last week is their potential effect on tentative plans to hold a referendum on changing the @entity32 to include better recognition of indigenous australians , a move many people see as a positive step			1
newspaper columnists and @entity35 leaders expressed concern that the media furor over the protesters ' actions would jeopardize the prospect of a referendum on constitutional change , which would require broad bipartisan support to pass			0
the government has so far suggested that it has not been dissuaded			0
" i believe that opportunity for us all to share in building a movement of change is still there , " @entity297 , the minister for indigenous affairs , wrote in an editorial this week for @entity299 , a daily newspaper			2
" it is part of the enduring work we are all undertaking , and that work is bigger than the headlines generated by one incident			0

protests involving @entity39 last week prompt introspection and alarm in @entity16
many commentators say protests do n't represent views of @entity319
@entity39 lag behind the overall population in terms of health , wealth and education
some say indigenous australians should n't be treated as disadvantaged group
