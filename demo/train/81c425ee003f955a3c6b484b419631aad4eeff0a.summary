@entity0 -- legalization of the more than 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the @entity5 would raise wages , increase consumption , create jobs and generate more tax revenue , two policy institutes say in a joint report thursday			1
the report by the @entity12 and the @entity13 estimates that " comprehensive immigration reform that legalizes currently unauthorized immigrants and creates flexible legal limits on future immigration " would yield at least $ 1.5 trillion in added @entity5 gross domestic product over a 10 - year period			1
" this is a compelling economic reason to move away from the current ' vicious cycle ' where enforcement - only policies perpetuate unauthorized migration and exert downward pressure on already low wages , and toward a ' virtuous cycle ' of worker empowerment in which legal status and labor rights exert upward pressure on wages , " study author @entity20 writes			1
the study looks at three scenarios : deportation of undocumented workers , temporary worker programs and legalization of the current undocumented population			2
deportation would lead to a loss of $ 2.6 trillion in gross domestic product over 10 years , the report says , while a worker program would lead to a gain of $ 792 billion			1
full legalization would lead to the best economic results , the study says			2
other groups , such as the @entity50 and the @entity51 , say that unfettered immigration harms the @entity5 and that entry into the nation must remain limited			1
when running for president in 2008 , @entity55 said that comprehensive immigration reform would be a priority in his administration , but the issue has been sidelined by health care reform efforts in @entity60 , the weak economy and the wars in @entity63 and @entity64			2
there are indications , however , that the @entity55 administration aims to revive immigration reform efforts in @entity60 this year			0
the study bases many of its conclusions on an examination of what happened after passage of the @entity74 , which granted legal status to 3 million unauthorized immigrants			1
a 2006 @entity78 report found that 56 percent of illegal immigrants in the @entity5 in 2005 were from @entity80 , a total of about 6.2 million unauthorized immigrants			1
about 2.5 million unauthorized migrants , or 22 percent of the total , came from the rest of @entity87 , primarily from @entity88 , the @entity78 study found			1
of the remaining illegal immigrants , about 13 percent were from @entity91 , and 3 percent were from @entity92 and @entity93 , the @entity78 study said			0
the report released thursday says @entity5 enforcement efforts -- mainly along the nearly 2,000 - mile border with @entity80 -- are costly and ineffective			2
" the number of unauthorized immigrants in the @entity5 has increased dramatically since the early 1990s despite equally dramatic increases in the amount of money the federal government spends on immigration enforcement , " study author @entity20 writes			1
according to the report , the @entity5 @entity105 says its annual budget has increased by 714 percent since 1992 , from $ 326.2 million in fiscal year 1992 to $ 2.7 billion in fiscal 2009			1
and the cost ratio of @entity105 expenditures to apprehensions has increased by 1,041 percent , from $ 272 per apprehension in 1992 to $ 3,102 in 2008			0
similarly , the @entity105 says the number of agents along the border with @entity80 has grown by 390 percent , from 3,555 in fiscal 1992 to 17,415 in 2009			0
" yet the unauthorized immigrant population of the @entity5 has roughly tripled in size over the past two decades , from an estimated 3.5 million in 1990 to 11.9 million in 2008 , " the report says , noting that illegal immigration appears to have declined slightly since 2007 as a result of the global recession			1
the report points out that a long - term study conducted by the @entity123 , found that 92 to 98 percent of unauthorized immigrants keep trying to cross the border until they succeed			1
increased enforcement has several unintended consequences , such as making the @entity130 border more lethal by channeling migrants through remote and rugged mountain and desert areas , the study found			0
the number of border - crossing deaths doubled in the decade after increased border enforcement started , a 2006 @entity135 report said			0
an october 2009 report by the @entity140 of @entity142 & @entity143 counties and @entity80 's @entity144 estimates that 5,607 migrants died while crossing the border between 1994 and 2008			0
tightened borders also have created new opportunities for people smugglers , who charged an average $ 2,000 to $ 3,000 per person in 2006 , the study said			0
ninety percent of illegal immigrants now hire smugglers , according to the report			2
an examination of trends after the 1986 immigration reform law shows that legalization of unauthorized immigrants has benefits , the report says			1
legalized workers earned more , moved on to better jobs and invested more in their education so they could get higher pay and better jobs			0
a previous study found that " the wages of unauthorized workers are generally unrelated to their actual skill level , " thursday 's report said			2
" unauthorized workers tend to be concentrated in the lowest - wage occupations ; they try to minimize the risk of deportation even if this means working for lower wages ; and they are especially vulnerable to outright exploitation by unscrupulous employers			2
once unauthorized workers are legalized , however , these artificial barriers to upward socioeconomic mobility disappear			0
" study author @entity20 is founding director of the @entity182 at the @entity123 , @entity183			0
the self - described progressive @entity12 is a nonpartisan research and educational think tank headed by @entity186 , who was chief of staff for president @entity187			0
the @entity188 , established in 2003 , also is a nonpartisan institute			0
the report , titled " raising the floor for @entity192 , @entity193 , " can be found on the @entity190 .			0

2 policy institutes look at the more than 11 million unauthorized immigrants in @entity5
report : legalization of current population would boost wages , consumption , jobs , tax revenue
institutes estimate $ 1.5 trillion boost in @entity5 gross domestic product over 10 years
but other groups say unfettered immigration harms @entity5 , so entry into nation must be limited
