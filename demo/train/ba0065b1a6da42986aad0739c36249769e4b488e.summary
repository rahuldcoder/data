@entity1 , @entity0 -- it 's the biggest film industry in the @entity4 and known as the @entity5 of the @entity7 world			1
veteran players like actor , @entity11 and director , @entity8 are known to film fans the world over			2
censors allowed @entity8 's latest film " @entity16 " which is about police brutality " @entity20 is the only country in the area , in the @entity4 , which has cinema industry in all the meaning of the word " explained @entity18 , the president of @entity19			1
but until recently strict state control which favors censorship -- and a monopoly on the industry by a handful of corporate giants peddling formulaic romantic comedies -- led to many years of decline for the @entity20 film industry			1
@entity11 -- famous globally for roles in the @entity36 epics , " @entity37 " and " @entity38 " -- agrees that censorship is harming the @entity20 film industry			1
" we have the studios , we have all the amenities they need but we have censorship			2
we have to check the script they 're shooting , we have to agree with it , that there is nothing @entity50 , anti-muslim			0
we 're losing a lot of income because of censorship here , " he said			2
today , a new wave of movie - makers are breaking traditional taboos , challenging the censors and taking @entity20 film into new markets around the globe			1
the latest of these films , " the @entity65 " was seen as a landmark in @entity20 cinematic history			1
it had the biggest ever budget and an all - star cast led by the revered actor @entity69 and featuring popular actress , @entity70			2
it also included subjects to challenge the censors and religious conservatives , including homosexuality and terrorism			0
the film 's director , @entity78 , says he had to work with the censors to ensure the script would be approved before filming : " it 's very important that you tackle a taboo subject but at the same time you do n't want the audience to leave the cinema and go , especially when you have a conservative audience , " he told @entity2			1
" the head of the censors , mr. @entity90 , was originally a very important film critic and he 's very liberal			2
i sat with him a lot and i told him what i was gon na do			0
it 's not about being the bravest it 's about being entertaining but at the same time giving the people the chance to watch the film , " he continued			2
@entity90 , head of the @entity20 censorship authority says they are becoming more tolerant of controversial issues			1
" in my own experience as a censor , i can assess that there is more freedom than in the past , " he said , " some recent films like " @entity113 " and certain films of @entity8 were examples of films that would never have passed the censor in earlier times			0
" " @entity16 " ( " @entity16 " ) the latest release of @entity20 's greatest living director , @entity8 -- almost 60 years after his directorial debut -- has ruffle feathers			1
the film tackles police brutality and corruption , both among several sensitive issues , which have challenged the @entity20 censors			1
censorship can be used as a tool to protect political regimes and public behaviours and beliefs , in @entity90 's view			2
" @entity20 , like many other @entity7 countries suffers from a very conservative or @entity132 current			1
this creates a lot of confusion and means that creative talented people often find themselves in opposition to the fundamentalist parties , " he said			0
but he is very positive about the future : " i like to think that in this last period with a new political climate and more freedom , censorship has become more tolerant to innovation			2
" one production company that is dramatically shaking up the whole film industry in @entity20 is " @entity148 "			1
it is the go - getting media giant behind " the @entity65 " and its ambitions are stretching in many directions			1
its latest production " the night of the @entity154 " -- has a budget of 40 million @entity20 pounds			1
that 's about $ 7 million -- a relatively modest budget in @entity5 terms but a figure which would typically finance three @entity20 movies			1
" we think and produce cinema in the same way as the @entity168 do " , says @entity161 , director of " @entity162 " and managing director of @entity164			0
bigger budgets means improved film quality and and in the future , the company hopes to produce films in @entity174 as well as @entity175			0
@entity161 acknowledges that in order to work internationally subject matter has to change to be , perhaps , less tuned in to local audiences in favour of wider ones -- but he is convinced cinema has the power to communicate over national borders			1
" we 're trying to work internationally because we need to communicate			0
this is the glamour or the magic of cinema			0
we know the jeans or the hamburger , everything from the @entity168 movies , so i think people will know us , " he said			0
the company aims to broaden minds beyond images of gun - battles and belly dancing synonymous with the region			0
" night of the @entity154 " is a comedy which highlights misunderstandings between the @entity7 and western worlds post- 9/11 -- it will be followed by an @entity7 take on the legend of @entity204			0
a new generation of film makers is emerging from @entity208 's @entity207 -- and more women are now following the path towards a future in film			0
what 's very promising is that women are getting involved in directing and producing excellent work , according to @entity18			0
" we have @entity216 , whose film " @entity219 " won an award at @entity19			0
we have very promising young ladies in the directing business , " he told @entity2			0
but even as some degree of liberation descends upon the @entity20 film industry , there are reminders about the boundaries of tastes - a lesbian kiss in @entity233 's latest film " until things @entity238 " brought calls for the director and both actresses to be jailed on moral grounds			1
@entity78 believes such challenges will continue but must be met face to face : " we will struggle a lot to be more daring because the films that were done recently they had a big effect on the audience and i do n't think we will be able to work as freely as we did			0
but i think there 's a new generation of film - makers that are very strong , hungry and really want to do something about it , " he said			0
