-- " @entity1 ! move yer bloomin ' arse ! " and with that , the exquisitely dressed @entity3 -- playing common @entity5 girl @entity4 -- smashes her genteel demeanor to smithereens , horrifying the lords and ladies gathered at @entity11 's most prestigious race meeting			1
so scandalous is @entity3 's legendary outburst in the @entity15 - winning 1964 film , @entity16 , one nearby aristocrat actually faints in shock			1
it may seem like an overblown reaction -- by today 's standards , @entity3 is n't even swearing -- but the famous scene at @entity22 , which kicked off on tuesday , points to the strict protocol still permeating the historic 300 - year - old horse race			1
this , after all , is the same five - day racing festival which opens with @entity26 parading around the track in an elegant horse - drawn carriage			1
and where does her majesty watch the famous competition ? none other than the very same stand where @entity3 bellowed her outrageous obscenities -- the @entity34			1
a class above as the name suggests , the @entity34 is n't just for any old riff - raff			2
this is the exclusive viewing area for royals , lords , and of course , fair ladies			1
of the 280,000 people who attend @entity22 each year , just 12,000 can be found hobnobbing in the plush @entity34 each day			1
to enter the luxury area , you must be sponsored by someone who has attended at least four times			0
once inside , expect to rub shoulders with @entity11 high society 's @entity49 -- everyone from the royal family to business magnates and film stars			1
" it 's a private club , " @entity55 , @entity22 head of communications , told @entity0			2
" but getting into the @entity34 is not a class divide , " @entity55 insisted			2
" in fact , we 're trying to encourage more people , especially young people , to join			0
" others , however , see @entity22 as the very embodiment of the @entity11 class system -- from the cheapest tickets in the @entity65 , to the standard @entity66 , and finally the best seats in the house , the @entity34			1
" arriving at @entity22 is a very much like boarding an aeroplane , " wrote @entity11 journalist @entity69			1
" you turn left for the expensive end of things -- the @entity34 and the grandstands ' snootier reaches -- or right for economy class , which is epitomized by the @entity65			2
" behind the velvet rope so what exactly does a $ 560 five - day ticket to the @entity34 get you ? apart from obvious bragging rights , the exclusive area features seating on the @entity66 's fourth floor , offering the best views of the course			1
then there are the glamorous garden marquees adorned with chandeliers and paintings as well as five - course lunches including such delicacies as peeled quail eggs in pink salt and lobster vinaigrette			0
however , calling them " marquees " is a bit of an understatement -- these sleek white structures are so huge they even include escalators and industrial kitchens			0
for the first time this year , @entity34 ticket - holders can also lounge in one of 25 trackside gazebos , with room for 12 people and offering waiter service plus prized car parking spaces immediately next door -- all for the princely sum of $ 780			2
dressed to impress all eyes will be on the @entity26 's horse estimate on thursday			2
the filly won a @entity116 race at last year 's royal meeting but her outing in the @entity119 represents a big step up in class			2
the @entity26 has not tasted @entity123 success in @entity11 since @entity124 captured the @entity125 in 1977 -- her @entity126 year			1
@entity127 is synonymous with " @entity128 " -- when the designer dresses and millinery masterpieces are just as much a focus as the horse racing			0
and much like @entity3 's iconic white lace dress and swooping feathered hat , @entity34 guests must follow strict fashion protocol or risk being turned away			1
the plush enclosure has the strictest dress rules on the race course : women must wear hats , or failing that , a headpiece with a 10 - centimeter base			0
@entity145 -- small ornaments attached to a headband -- are a no - no. as are strapless , off - the - shoulder and halter neck tops			0
all straps must also be at least one inch thick			0
likewise , men are required to wear waistcoats , ties and top hats			0
in comparison , the @entity65 , which offers $ 45 daily tickets , simply requires its racegoers to wear smart clothes , with a reminder that " bare chests are not permitted at any time			0
" @entity163 tradition dating back to the 1820s , the @entity34 was originally a two - story stand commissioned by @entity165 , with only those receiving a personal invitation from his highness getting a look - in			2
such was the exclusivity of the enclosure , it was only in 1955 that divorcees were allowed to enter			0
" its charm is that it 's so steeped in history , " said @entity55			0
" it started as a very private affair for the royal family -- basically an individual stand with a viewing garden			0
" " today it 's much more than a single entity -- there are the grandstands , marquees , private boxes			0
you will probably see the queen there -- her majesty has her own official guest pen ( enclosure )			0
" so what would the @entity26 have made of @entity3 's outburst ? one can only guess her highness would not have been amused .			1
