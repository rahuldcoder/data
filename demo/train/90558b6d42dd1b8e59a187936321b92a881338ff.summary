@entity0 , @entity1 -- the chipped walls of @entity5 's tiny home are bandaged together with clear packing tape			1
@entity5 , together with his wife and son , live in a narrow , 53 - square foot room furnished with a bed , faded chair and table			0
they share a bathroom with 20 to 30 neighbors in their building in suburban @entity0 -- a little piece of home for @entity1 's army of migrant workers			1
despite their modest living conditions , @entity5 insists his family 's standard of living is improving			1
" i feel we are already getting better and better , " he said			0
like 200 million @entity1 migrants , @entity5 , 30 and his wife , @entity26 , 26 , are part of the " nongmingong " -- which means peasant class , a term used to describe those who 've left the countryside			1
they are also known as " liudong renkou " which means floating population			0
in the last decades , as waves of migrant workers have found jobs in the cities , hundreds of millions in @entity1 have been lifted out of poverty , according to official estimates			1
but beyond @entity1 's successful facade , migrant workers face difficulties accessing public services due to a household registration system called " hukou , " which divides the population into rural and urban residents			1
when a migrant worker like @entity5 leaves his village , he also leaves his social benefits behind			1
without an urban hukou permit , a migrant is often denied access to the subsidized health , housing and education that city dwellers enjoy			1
the workers find odd jobs in factories , construction sites , public infrastructure projects , restaurants and households but can not enjoy the same privileges as urbanites			2
" their plight has been described as them being like illegal immigrants in their own country , " according to the @entity74 , a @entity1 state - controlled newspaper			1
some scholars have likened @entity1 's hukou system to @entity79 's now - defunct apartheid , a system of segregation that severely restricted the rights of the country 's black population , with whites enjoying preferential treatment			1
this legalized form of discrimination relegated the nation 's black workers to migrant labor with little rights			1
@entity1 's migrant workers never integrate into the city to enjoy the same rights and opportunities as urbanites , said @entity98 , an author of an upcoming book about migrant workers			1
" the discrimination is very real in @entity1 , " he added			1
@entity1 's urban explosion : a 21st century challenge under the hukou system , migrant workers can secure temporary residence certificates but getting them is a lengthy process			1
in some cases , their employers are obligated to pay exorbitant fees to the city government for such certificates			0
@entity5 , who has a tanned , leathery face , spends 10 hours a day painting outside , dangling from high buildings where he 's exposed to the sun , heat and wind			2
when asked about his dreams for his family 's future , they say they want to open a store someday and be able to send their son , who is now two , to middle school			1
" i 'll still be a migrant worker , " he said			1
" during our lifetime , i guess we wo n't have any high hopes , " said @entity5			2
" really any hopes are for the children			0
" his son shyly hides behind his parents			0
squirming on a bed that he shares with both parents , the toddler peeks over his mother 's shoulders			2
@entity5 's wife , @entity140 , is pregnant with their second child			1
they plan to pay a fine -- about $ 1,500 -- for violating the country 's @entity145			2
@entity140 plans to give birth in her village in @entity150 province			0
their reasoning for having a second child pertains to their migrant worker status			1
" if something went wrong , and you lost your only child , then you would grow old alone , " @entity5 said			2
" you 'd at least want two , no ? one is just not enough			0
especially for us , villagers			0
the city and the village -- it is not the same			0
" when people get old in the city they can just be sent to the old people 's home , where as if we grow old , we can only rely on our children , " his wife added			2
" we do n't have any pension			2
we do n't have any hope or anything			1
all of that we put it on the shoulders of our children			0
so if there are n't enough kids , and something goes wrong , we are also done for			2
" they acknowledge that raising a second child adds financial pressures ; but in a way , a second child provides a security net in a society where migrant workers do not have one			1
while people in the cities have pensions , @entity140 said their village has nothing			0
@entity1 media , including state - run news agencies , have reported on the difficulties faced by migrant workers			1
for example , the children of migrant workers can not go to the same school as the city kids			2
they 've been called " liu dong er tong , " which means floating children , because of the question of where they can go to school and how they 'll be able to afford it			0
migrant children have to pay for private schooling , said the author @entity211 , who taught at one for migrant children			0
in @entity1 , calling it " private school " is also misleading , he said			2
" they 're not getting the same quality of education			0
it 's not even close to their counterparts , ' city kids ' although they are city kids , " he said			0
without education and opportunities , many children of migrants end up doing the same work as their parents			0
this continuous cycle has spanned almost four generations , @entity211 said			0
" i think in the last 15 to 20 years , it 's not a socially mobile society , " he said			0
and there are signs of unrest			0
thousands of workers rioted in @entity237 province early this year after reports that police officers had beaten a migrant teenager in june , according to both @entity1 and @entity242 media reports			1
tensions also spilled over into violence in the city of @entity246 last year when migrant workers clashed with locals after reports that officials had beaten a pregnant migrant worker and her husband			1
some families pin their hopes on their kids to break the cycle by gaining admission into a university			0
the chances of that , @entity211 said , are " very very slim			0
" @entity5 insists that he wants his son to go to school			0
" we villagers do n't have many ambitious hopes about our kids , as long as he goes to school and studies hard			0
otherwise , we do n't have any plans for our kids ... i just hope he does n't do what we are doing			2

migrant family 's hope is that their child does n't also have to be migrant worker
@entity1 operates on a system that *differentiates* between rural and urban
rural workers ' plight likened to illegal immigrants and apartheid
