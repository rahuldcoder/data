@entity1 president @entity0 is faced with a hugely delicate balancing act : the need to maintain good economic relations with @entity5 while trying to keep @entity7 's push for reunification at bay			1
the latter has become an increasingly tense issue			0
during a recent session with reporters in the presidential office building , @entity0 leaned back in a dark - blue armchair under an oil painting of @entity17 -- modern @entity5 's founding father whose legacy is claimed by @entity20 and @entity7 -- and delivered a clear message : economic relations with @entity5 should be developed but not at the cost of sovereignty			1
" during my tenure as president , i will not discuss unification with mainland @entity5 , " he declared			1
but he added that he would " not promote independence , let alone the use of force " either			1
" i believe this is essential to achieving a stable and lasting framework for peaceful development , " he said			0
@entity0 says his government is watching pro-democracy protests in @entity36 closely to see whether @entity7 will honor its initial promises on universal suffrage			2
the city is regarded as a testing ground for the " one country , two systems " formula that @entity5 's leaders originally hoped would entice @entity1 back into the fold			1
@entity5 and @entity1 -- officially the @entity5 and the @entity1 -- separated in 1949 following a civil war			1
but @entity5 still claims @entity1 as its territory and , to this day , is reported to have missiles pointed at the island			1
@entity0 said he does " not fear that @entity1 will become a second @entity36 , " as the two were completely different cases			1
he also admitted a soft spot for the former @entity54 colony that was also his birthplace			0
" i feel a close affinity with @entity36			0
" one country , two systems @entity58 , @entity5 's most powerful president in decades , has brought new urgency to the unification issue by stating that the problem should not be pushed from generation to generation			1
in september , he expressed his " firm and unwavering stance " on reunification under the idea of " one country , two systems " during a meeting with pro-unification delegates in @entity7			1
within hours , @entity0 rejected the idea as " unacceptable			0
" during the interview , @entity0 acknowledged his counterpart in @entity7 has a more " high - handed posture " than his predecessors			0
and in a speech on the island 's national day october 10 , he urged @entity58 to introduce democracy for his 1.3 billion people -- letting free elections in @entity36 be the first step			0
@entity0 has also encouraged mainland @entity5 exchange students to study in @entity1 to experience its open society			1
" we have never wistfully thought that mainland @entity5 would become democratized quickly , " he said			1
" all our efforts in @entity1 have aimed at showing ethnic @entity5 societies around the world that the imported concept of democracy can take root , germinate , and grow into a big tree on purely ethnic @entity5 soil			1
" @entity5 state media last week accused @entity1 of recruiting mainland students studying on the island as spies			1
soon after , @entity1 banned senior officials from studying in @entity5 for " national security " reasons			2
' coddling tyrants ? ' despite his firm position against reunification , @entity0 , who took office 2008 , has made more of an attempt to ease tensions with the mainland than any of his predecessors -- mainly by creating closer business relations and signing a total of 21 cooperative agreements , including the ground - breaking @entity111 , @entity111			1
many @entity1 companies have moved factories to @entity5 , while @entity5 banks now operate on the island			2
six years ago no direct flights existed between the island and the mainland ; today there are hundreds of flight a week and tourists are flooding in			0
@entity122 of the @entity123 said @entity1 's leader is making progress as he negotiates the thin line between economic pragmatism and sovereignty			0
" @entity0 is doing more for @entity1 in terms of democratization , economic development and the preservation of autonomy than he would if he took the position of his predecessors , " he said			2
" i personally have a very high opinion of president @entity0 , and i think he has the balance right			1
his main difficulties are being accused of ' coddling the tyrants in @entity7 ' of course			0
" but his critics say the relationship with @entity7 has become too cozy			0
last spring , hundreds of students of the so - called " @entity145 " occupied @entity1 's parliament in protest			0
that led to a major trade agreement being blocked and a new souring of relations with @entity5			2
@entity152 , deputy director of international affairs for the opposition pro-independent @entity154 ( @entity154 ) , said in a recent interview that the 21 cross-strait agreements were signed too hastily and without proper review			0
@entity1 or @entity5 ? today , less than 10 % of people support the idea of immediate or eventual reunification -- a figure that has declined consistently over the years			1
results of a survey by @entity164 in june found that 60 % of respondents identified as @entity1 -- an historic high -- compared to just 3.5 % as @entity5			2
a clear majority supports the political status quo of de facto independence			0
now , with @entity7 rejecting true democracy in @entity36 -- despite a public backlash -- the idea of " one country , two systems , " seems even more unappealing to the people of @entity1			0
" the leaders in @entity7 are afraid that if they give democracy to @entity36 , then other parts of @entity5 , like @entity178 and @entity179 , will also ask for it , " said a 17 - year old female high school student who lives in @entity20			0
" i hope @entity1 never in my life time reunifies with @entity5			2
it would be very bad			0
we would lose our freedom			0
" her words echoed those of many ordinary people i spoke to in @entity20			0
" many people in @entity1 want independence , " said a young woman called @entity190 who manages a small caf√© in @entity20 , @entity1 's capital			2
" but that 's impossible without the backing of other powerful countries , like the @entity197			0
i still think president @entity0 should be stronger against @entity5			1
" @entity199 , an independent , @entity200 - based researcher and volunteer with @entity202 , says that if peaceful unification is going to happen , it is going to have to come through a democratic process whereby millions of @entity1 choose to join @entity5			2
" thus far , it looks like most @entity1 do n't want reunification so long as @entity5 remains an authoritarian state with little respect for human rights , " he said .			1
