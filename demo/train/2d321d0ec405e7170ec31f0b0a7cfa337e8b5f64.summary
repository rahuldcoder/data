-- on @entity2 , we thought it might be a good time to take a look at some of the rules for respectfully displaying the @entity9 flag , as dictated by the @entity10			1
when did these flag rules fall into place ? surprisingly late in @entity9 history			1
on @entity17 in 1923 , a group of organizations headed by the @entity16 outlined the @entity18 as a set of advisory rules for displaying the flag			1
these rules became law during @entity24 and form the bulk of what 's now the @entity10			2
these rules cover all manner of extremely specific situations , but they 're all governed by the same basic principle : the flag is one of the most visible and important symbols of our country , so we should treat it with respect			1
are you really supposed to lower the flag at sunset ? you do n't have to			0
while the flag code notes that displaying the flag only from sunrise to sunset is " universal custom , " it makes an exception			1
" however , when a patriotic effect is desired , the flag may be displayed 24 hours a day if properly illuminated during the hours of darkness			0
" when should the flag be displayed ? section 6 of the flag code states , " the flag should be displayed on all days			1
" however , the code goes on to say that the flag should especially ( emphasis added ) be displayed on the following days : @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity60 's birthday , @entity62 's birthday , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity2 , @entity17 , @entity66 , @entity67 , national korean war veterans @entity68 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , state holidays , states ' dates of admission , and " such other days as may be proclaimed by the @entity81			1
" where should the flag be displayed ? section 6 of the flag code covers this question , too			1
the flag should be displayed in or near every schoolhouse on school days , on or near the main administration building of every public institution each day , and in or near every polling place on election days			0
why does n't , say , the @entity93 take the courts in @entity9 - flag jerseys at the @entity96 ? the flag code thought of that one , too			1
section 8 of the code covers " @entity104 , " and it explicitly states , " no part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or athletic uniform			2
however , a flag patch may be affixed to the uniform of military personnel , firemen , policemen , and members of patriotic organizations			0
" @entity112 : why do we sing the @entity114 at sporting events ? any other restrictions on wearing the flag ? section 8 also states , " the flag should never be used as wearing apparel , bedding , or drapery			0
" what about those @entity9 flag lapel pins that so many folks wear ? the flag code thought of that one , too			1
section 8 rather elegantly states , " the flag represents a living country and is itself considered a living thing			2
therefore , the lapel flag pin being a replica , should be worn on the left lapel near the heart			0
" is it true you have to retire and burn a flag that touches the ground ? no , that 's a myth			2
the flag code is quite a bit more realistic about this situation			1
while the code states , " the flag should never touch anything beneath it , such as the ground , the floor , water , or merchandise , " there 's no rule saying that a flag that slips has to immediately be burned			2
instead , the code stipulates , " the flag , when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem for display , should be destroyed in a dignified way , preferably by burning			2
" unless hitting the ground once renders the flag unfit for display , there 's no need to burn it			2
when is it acceptable to fly the flag upside down ? the flag code allows for flying the flag with the union ( the blue field of stars ) down only " as a signal of dire distress in instances of extreme danger to life or property			1
" we know that the @entity9 flag is supposed to be displayed in a position of prominence over other flags on @entity9 soil			0
are there any exceptions to this rule ? section 7 of the flag code provides one major exception : the flag of the @entity191 can be flown in the position of honor or prominence at the @entity191 headquarters in @entity196			1
the only other exception involves church services performed by naval chaplains while at sea			0
in these instances , the church 's flag may fly above the @entity9 flag during the service			2
@entity112 : videos : dogs welcoming home soldiers what 's the penalty for breaking the flag code ? there is n't one			1
the flag code is an odd duck in this regard			1
as part of the @entity217 , the flag code is technically federal law			1
however , the code does n't outline any measures for enforcement or punishment			0
basically , the flag code is a set of advisory rules for @entity9 who want to know the proper and respectful way to display their flag			1
even if the flag code did provide measures for its enforcement , it 's not clear that the measures would be constitutional			1
individual states used to have their own prohibitions on and penalties for desecrating the flag , but the 1989 @entity237 decision @entity236 invalidated these laws as infringements on free speech			0
@entity241 responded by passing the @entity242 , which made flag desecration a federal crime			0
the @entity237 struck down this law in the 1990 case @entity246			0
can anyone stop me from displaying the flag ? in 2006 the @entity250 to display the @entity251 officially became law			2
this law basically says that no condo board , housing co-op , or residential real estate management group can restrict a person 's right to display the @entity9 flag on their own residential property as long as the display jibes with federal law and is reasonable			0
what days is the flag always flown at half - staff ? the flag always flies on half - staff on @entity270 ( september 11 of each year ) , @entity266 ( may 15 ) , and @entity267 ( december 7 )			0
on @entity2 , the flag flies at half - staff until noon , at which point it is raised to the top of the staff			0
what if i ca n't fly my flag at half - staff ? some flags , like the ones commonly seen in school classrooms or on houses , are fixed in a certain position on their poles			0
how does one handle the sticky situation of a flag that physically ca n't be flown at half - staff ? the @entity217 does n't cover this conundrum , but the @entity16 advocates adding a black ribbon to the top of the flag 's pole to indicate mourning			0
@entity112 : why is the flag flown at half - staff in times of mourning ? what about adding new stars for new states ? should we ever pick up a 51st state , section 2 of the flag code stipulates that the state will get a new star on the flag			1
it wo n't be an overnight process , though			0
the new star will make its debut on the first @entity67 following the state 's formal admission into the union			0

1923 : the @entity18 created advisory rules for displaying the flag
