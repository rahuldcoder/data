ever have one of those days where you just wan na be alone , maybe have the planet to yourself ? well , based on sheer numbers , there may be a planet just for you			0
astronomers at the @entity7 and the @entity8 , using data from @entity11 's kepler space telescope , estimate there are tens of billions of @entity14 - size , possibly habitable planets in our @entity17 galaxy			1
given that there just more than 7 billion of us on this planet , that means a planet for each of us with some spares for your picky neighbors			0
or a vacation planet or two for you , maybe			0
and the closest may be circling a star you can see if you look up into the heavens tonight			0
" when you look up at the thousands of stars in the night sky , the nearest sun - like star with an @entity14 - size planet in its habitable zone is probably only 12 light years away and can be seen with the naked eye			1
that is amazing , " @entity7 graduate student @entity40 , the leader of the team that analyzed data from the @entity43 , said in a press release			1
lonely , young planet drifting in space without a star to be sure , the astronomers have n't seen any of the planets themselves			1
they came to their conclusions like this : the @entity43 telescope photographed 150,000 of the 300 billion stars in the @entity17 every 30 minutes for four years			1
it looked for when orbiting planets passed between the camera and the star , causing a slight change in brightness of that star			0
analyzing the data , the astronomers say , they found 3,000 planet candidates			1
the astronomers narrowed that number by focusing on just 42,000 stars like our sun or a bit cooler			1
that brought the number of planets down to 603			2
but only 10 of those were about the size of @entity14 in the so - called " @entity77 , " just the right distance from the star where temperatures are suitable for life as we know it			0
diamonds may be produced on other planets so how did they get a number of planets in the billions ? by using a computer model with fake planets to test the validity of the algorithms used in the calculations			2
" what we 're doing is taking a census of extrasolar planets , but we ca n't knock on every door			0
only after injecting these fake planets and measuring how many we actually found could we really pin down the number of real planets that we missed , " @entity40 said in the press release			2
using the data , the astronomers calculated that 22 % of stars in the @entity17 similar to our sun have planets like @entity14 in their " @entity77			1
" as there are about 20 billion stars similar to the sun in the galaxy , the possibilities add up quickly -- more than one for each of us @entity116			2
stargazing in the desert : the magic of @entity121 's night skies the researchers do caution , though , that despite being in the habitable zone , a planet could still not be right to host life			2
" some may have thick atmospheres , making it so hot at the surface that @entity131 - like molecules would not survive			0
others may have rocky surfaces that could harbor liquid water suitable for living organisms			0
we do n't know what range of planet types and their environments are suitable for life , " @entity136 , @entity7 professor of astronomy , said in a press release			0
but the study gives researchers a number to work with			0
" the primary goal of the @entity43 mission was to answer the question : when you look up in the night sky , what fraction of the stars that you see have @entity14 - size planets at lukewarm temperatures so that water would not be frozen into ice or vaporized into steam , but remain a liquid , because liquid water is now understood to be the prerequisite for life , " @entity136 said			1
" until now , no one knew exactly how common potentially habitable planets were around @entity169 - like stars in the galaxy			1
" the new study is published in the @entity172 and was discussed this week at the second @entity173 , being held at @entity11 's @entity174 in @entity175 , @entity176			0
also at the gathering , scientists announced the @entity43 telescope has found 833 new candidate planets , including 10 that are of the right size and right distance from their stars to host life , adding to ones previously confirmed			1
that brings the official list to 3,538 planet candidates found using @entity43 , according to a @entity11 press release			1
of those , smaller @entity14 - sized planets are most common , @entity11 said .			2

astronomers used @entity43 telescope data to *extrapolate* number of planets in @entity17
22 % of sun - like stars have possibly habitable planets , research shows
@entity43 has found 3,538 planet candidates to date
