-- everyone knows about the risks that narcotics pose and the lethal war waged against them			0
but there are probably far more deaths caused by dangerous therapeutic medicines			0
lazy , cost - cutting manufacturers and criminal counterfeiters make billions of dollars a year peddling products that may kill you , which you might find online or even at your neighborhood pharmacy			1
i first came across dangerous drugs while evaluating hiv and malaria projects in @entity18 eight years ago			0
patients were dying because the pills did not provide the needed medicine			1
fakes contained chalk , talcum powder , road paint and occasionally dangerous heavy metals , instead of the expensive , hard - to - make medicine			1
@entity29 commissioner talks counterfeit drugs terrorist organizations such as @entity32 have profited from this trade , but no group has so far used it as a weapon			1
most producers of bad products are not trying to kill patients			1
they are out to make money and simply do not care who gets hurt , or even dies , in the process			2
it is impossible to know the exact size of the trade or its lethal impact -- some guesses are as high as 700,000 deaths globally each year			1
i estimate that bad medicines cause at least 100,000 deaths annually			0
some markets are barely affected , while others are replete with substandard products			2
playing @entity55 roulette with fake drugs " pharmaceutical counterfeiting is a low - risk , high - profit criminal enterprise that attracts entrepreneurs and organized criminals , " says @entity57 , vice president and chief security officer for the drug company @entity59			1
" what was once seen as a problem limited to lifestyle medicines is now recognized as a threat from which no therapeutic area is immune			0
" up to a third of the market for anti-malarials are suspect in some way , and around 10 % of all essential drugs in emerging markets fail basic quality tests			0
while the @entity77 is much better served -- far less than 1 % of all drugs are faulty -- even if only 0.001 % of the 4 billion prescriptions filled in this country every year were compromised , 40,000 prescriptions could be deadly			0
more worryingly , lethal drug incidents are on the rise in the @entity77			2
fakes of heparin , a blood - thinning drug , killed 149 @entity77 in 2007 and 2008 , and many more deaths likely go undetected every year			2
@entity29 : beware of ' fake ' potassium iodide in most cases , no crime is suspected as the consumers are often quite sick and the evidence is swallowed			2
if a relative with a heart problem dies from a heart attack , who would think to investigate the medicine ? but fake @entity98 , @entity99 's most - often reimbursed heart medication , has been found in numerous countries			1
before the civil war in @entity105 , its capital , @entity103 , was home to a major counterfeit drug operation that made tens of millions of dollars between 2003 and 2009			2
the ring manufactured more than 80 brands -- including @entity98 -- of fake medicine very convincingly , only distinguishable from real drugs by experts			1
yet none of them contained the correct ingredients			0
fake antibiotics , cancer and heart medications penetrated every major market of the @entity120 , including the one funded by @entity77 tax dollars in @entity122			2
while part of the operation was shut down in 2009 , some gang members fled and reassembled in @entity122 and @entity126			0
my sources in the @entity120 believe that this gang may have begun operations again in @entity103 , bribing officials with their vast wealth to turn a blind eye			0
most worrying for @entity77 , they may have been the source of the fake cancer - drug avastin that surfaced in @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 in march and april			1
fighting the growing menace of fake drugs @entity77 authorities are limited in combating illegal trades outside the @entity77			2
international law is currently inadequate to combat international fake drug rings , and there is a need for a global treaty against such products			1
i am optimistic that this will change within the next decade ; international laws will be strengthened , and global efforts against counterfeiters will constrain their activities			1
but i am less certain that governments will effectively tackle legal producers who make bad products			1
these companies pay their taxes , provide jobs and have political clout across numerous emerging markets			0
cutthroat competition among chemical and drug manufacturers keeps prices low , but it also encourages corner - cutting			1
in some emerging markets , there are more than 300 brands of the same class of medicine			0
local regulators do not have enough competent staff to conduct either thorough inspections of all production plants or survey products in the market			0
consequently , companies routinely get away with substandard production			0
most tragically , these producers undercut better producers on price and sometimes force more responsible players to exit the market			0
@entity187 and @entity188 producers dominate many drug categories in emerging markets , notably anti-infectives			0
while many of these companies make good medicines , a substantial subset routinely target poor markets with substandard versions			0
until regulators and customers in emerging markets demand better products , tens of thousands will be killed by substandard drugs , and unfortunately some of these products will make their way to @entity77 markets , too			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			1
