-- @entity1 from an @entity3 volcano is continuing to affect @entity5 flights on monday , delaying transatlantic aircraft and threatening flights over parts of @entity9 and @entity10			1
@entity11 , the agency that manages @entity5 air travel , said : " during the afternoon , areas of higher ash concentration could move in a north - easterly direction from the @entity16 into the @entity17			0
" @entity18 , the budget airline , canceled 18 flights on monday as it expected the airspace surrounding @entity22 airport in the southwest of @entity9 and @entity21 in @entity10 to be affected by the ash cloud			1
@entity18 said in a statement on its web site : " passengers are strongly recommended to check their flight status before they go to the airport			0
" @entity11 said much of the high - concentration ash cloud over continental @entity5 had dispersed and that despite the delays , all @entity5 airports were open on monday afternoon			2
the @entity33 @entity32 said that transatlantic flights were still rerouting around ash that was lying between 20,000 to 35,000 feet in the atmosphere			1
a @entity32 spokesman told @entity0 : " the ash cloud is slowly disappearing , it 's descending and dispersing , there is n't one big cloud ... it 's ash in the air over a very large area			0
transatlantic flights are rerouting around it , causing delays			1
" @entity11 said it expected approximately 28,500 flights within the @entity5 area , which is about 500 below average for a monday at this time of year			0
@entity50 airports in @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 as well as six airports in @entity55 were closed over the weekend because of the ash cloud			0
volcanic ash can be a serious hazard to aircraft , reducing visibility , damaging flight controls and ultimately causing jet engines to fail			2
the problems began in mid-april , when the volcano beneath the @entity65 in southern @entity3 erupted and sent a cloud of ash into the atmosphere , closing most of @entity5 's airspace for six days .			2
