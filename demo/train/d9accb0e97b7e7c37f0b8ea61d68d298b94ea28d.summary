-- watching @entity2 at work amid the clutter in his garage cum workshop , it 's easy to see why one of his sons refers to him as a sort of " nutty professor			1
" the @entity11 inventor has been tinkering with " liquid air " engines at his home in @entity15 , @entity16 for more than three decades			1
" i do n't think it 's any good having ideas and not being able to make them			0
it 's very difficult if you just go to people with ideas -- you ca n't actually show them it working , " @entity2 says			2
all that hard work is starting to pay off , as interest in the 61 - year - old 's invention -- which has applications for both motoring and renewable energy storage -- gathers pace			1
liquid air is essentially air which has been cooled to very low , or cryogenic , temperatures ( around -190 degrees @entity36 or -310 degrees @entity37 ) and can be stored in insulted containers			1

if this process of reheating is conducted in a confined space , say , an engine cylinder , it creates high pressure air which can drive a piston			2
whilst building a car powered by liquid air is nothing new -- a model was demonstrated as early as 1903 -- @entity2 's adaptation is			1
" the unique thing about this engine is that it uses a heat exchange fluid ( in this case , anti-freeze ) which is placed on top of the piston in the cylinder , " @entity2 explains			2
" into that we introduce liquid nitrogen which is atomized and gives us good heat contact			0
the heat exchange fluid keeps the gas warm ( as the piston moves up and down ) and increases the efficiency			0
" @entity2 has come a long way since he developed his first working prototype using a modified a lawn mower engine			2
today , he demonstrates a custom - built car which runs smoothly around a farmyard near his home			0
read : shutter shades creates new fashion code the technology has caught the eye of @entity11 engineering company @entity80 who are currently building an engine based on @entity2 's design for use in agricultural vehicles and mining equipment			1
the company say the engine has " numerous practical applications in the future market place ... and is likely to compete with hydrogen fuel cell and battery electric systems			0
" liquid air could also help store surplus energy generated by wind and solar			1
" [ energy storage ] is essential because , with any renewable energy source , it 's variable			1
so you have to be able to store a certain amount of it to cope with peak demand , " @entity2 said			2
a pilot power plant in @entity104 , @entity105 -- the first of its kind in the world -- is currently trialing the technology			1
read : toy chopper takes mental concentration to new heights a huge vacuum flask at the facitlity holds 60 tons of liquid air , but instead of anti-freeze , they mix it with waste heat coming from the neighboring power station			1
but the principles are exactly the same , @entity2 says			0
" we take a large tank , heat it with waste heat and that creates the pressure that runs the turbine which creates electricity ... simple , " he says			0
the plant run by @entity129 -- a company co-founded by @entity2 and jointly funded by the @entity11 government -- can generate 500 kilowatts of power , he says , but there is nothing to stop them being made on a much larger scale			1
using waste heat also raises efficiency levels up to 70 % -- not as high as the 80 % battery storage can achieve , but competitive			0
it also has one crucial advantage , @entity2 says			0
" batteries are n't really scalable , you ca n't use them worldwide because there 's not enough materials to make batteries from			0
so you need a system that does n't use scarce resources , " he said			0
the @entity11 's @entity150 ( @entity150 ) recently launched a working group investigating the potential of liquid air storage			1
speaking in october , @entity150 's @entity155 , @entity154 said : " liquid air and liquid nitrogen are an exciting alternative we should explore to store energy			1
it seems to address many of the challenges we face and is affordable , uses mature components and is highly scalable			0
" all this is rich encouragement for @entity2 , who is n't driven by money , but by a lifelong fascination with energy and a desire to help make the world a more efficient place			2
" it 's not right that one generation should use up most of the world 's resources during their lifetime			0
so , the more we can do to alleviate that the better , i think			0
