-- would n't moving objects with your mind be fun ? but the implications go deeper : for the millions of @entity5 who live with paralysis , mentally controlling artificial limbs and mobility devices would be a big step forward toward more independent living			1
@entity12 , director of the @entity13 at the @entity14 , is trying to make that happen			1
@entity16 started this lab in 1998 to look at methods of brain control that did n't involve surgery			1
at that time , she estimates , there were about five labs working on the same topic of brain - computer interfaces			1
now there are about 300			0
the @entity27 was one of the first to demonstrate that a person can control a robotic arm and a wheelchair with brain signals , @entity16 said			1
" we can literally influence the wiring of the brain , rewiring the brain , so to speak , to allow them to make new neural connections , and hopefully to restore movement to a paralyzed arm , " @entity16 said			1
about 6 million @entity5 live with paralysis , according to the @entity42			1
a smaller subset in need of such technologies consists of patients with locked - in syndrome , a rare neurological disorder			0
these patients feel , think , and understand language , but can not move or speak -- they are " prisoners in their own bodies , " @entity16 explained			0
a famous example is @entity54 , who became locked - in after a stroke , and wrote the memoir " @entity56 " by blinking to indicate individual letters			0
@entity16 wants to open up possibilities for people with locked - in syndrome to communicate and move			1
there has been a lot of activity in brain - computer interfaces to help such people			1
another pioneering research group in this area is the laboratory of @entity69 at @entity70 for @entity71			0
@entity69 and colleagues have shown that a rhesus monkey in @entity74 could , using only its brain , control the walking patterns of a robot in @entity78			1
in 2011 , they got a monkey to move a virtual arm and feel sensations from it			0
this team is leading the @entity85 , an international consortium of research centers dedicated to creating brain - computer interfaces to restore movement			1
one technique that @entity16 and colleagues use to harness brain signals is called functional near - infrared spectroscopy			2
this involves shining a light into the brain to discern how much activity is there , and examining the corresponding oxygen level			2
light at a specific wavelength is beamed into the brain , and the oxygen present will absorb some of that light			2
this allows scientists to pick up on small differences in the blood 's oxygenation			2
for example , scientists can place a sensor over the @entity111 's area , a part of the brain essential for language			1
this area is activated when you talk to yourself inside your head or count silently , which is called subvocal speech			0
scientists can use the oxygen levels associated with this to create a system of allowing a person to say " yes " and " no " just by thinking ; " no " corresponds to no subvocal speech or nonsense syllables			0
the original hardware for a device that utilizes this technique was developed by @entity128 , and it allows a person with locked - in syndrome to say " yes " or " no , " @entity16 said			0
but @entity16 wanted to make something more interesting to learn			0
her group created a hot - air balloon video game , where the balloon reflects the blood oxygenation level			0
multiple locked - in syndrome patients can compete with each other in this game			0
" it 's not necessarily just for fun , " @entity16 said			2
" we can actually say , ' well , they got 70 % of the obstacles correct , they were able to jump over the mountains or get through the wind			0
' and so it also allows us to collect data			0
" in the stroke rehabilitation arena , @entity16 's group hopes to restore movement in people who have paralysis or partial paralysis in a limb			1
researchers are looking at a rehabilitation robot called an exoskeleton , a device that a person sits in to be able to move limbs that they would n't otherwise			2
the robot can detect the brain signal corresponding to a person thinking about moving an arm , and then move the arm			1
" what we 're trying to do is make new neural connections from the brain to the arm , " @entity16 said			2
the lab has also developed a wheelchair that a person can drive by using brain signals , rather than moving a joystick or pressing buttons			1
such brain - computer interfaces require that the user wear an @entity181 cap to measure brain signals , but setting one up is very complicated			2
@entity16 hopes to make it accessible for anyone to use in their own home			0
" you can imagine how much faster the therapy would go if you were doing it all the time , " she said .			0

@entity12 is the director of @entity14 's @entity27
about 6 million @entity5 live with paralysis
moving limbs and wheelchairs with the brain could help many people with limited mobility
