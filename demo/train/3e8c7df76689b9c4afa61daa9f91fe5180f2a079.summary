@entity1 , @entity0 -- thousands of documents about reported @entity5 sightings -- ranging from calm accounts by professional pilots to unhinged rants about the extraterrestrial menace -- have been released by the @entity11 @entity10			1
@entity13 resident @entity12 took these pictures showing a ball of fire trailing across the sky			0
the 4,500 pages cover sightings that were reported from 1986 through 1992			1
the @entity11 military released them to a curious public as part of a four - year project to transfer all such documents to the @entity26			1
one highlight from the batch released monday involves the captain of an @entity31 airliner			1
he shouted " look out ! " to his co-pilot in april 1991 after claiming to see a beige " missile - shaped object " shoot past the cockpit			1
in that instance , the defence ministry ruled out a missile and " all the usual explanations , " wrote @entity40 , a @entity5 expert and journalism instructor at @entity42 , who worked with the @entity26 to prepare the new materials for release			2
" the end result was this was a genuine @entity5 and the file was simply closed , " he wrote			2
" there was nothing more they could do			0
" the newly released documents also carry an account by a @entity55 @entity54 pilot who says he was told to shoot down an unidentified flying craft over eastern @entity0			2
but before he could fire , the object disappeared			0
the next day , a man arrived to debrief the pilot and " he was told in no uncertain terms that what he had seen on his radar was top secret and he was n't to speak about it to anyone , " @entity40 wrote			0
the first set of files was made available to members of the public in may			0
it covered reported @entity5 sightings from 1978 to 1987 , and included hundreds of police reports taken from witnesses who described seeing lights or strange objects in the sky			1
people who reported having seen ufos typically describe various shapes and colors of lights , moving in formation or hovering in the sky			0
witnesses reported orange , red , white and green lights that were diamond - shaped , square , or cigar - shaped			1
they reported them to police , who have a standard 16 - question form specifically for @entity5 sightings			1
" the vast majority of them are just ordinary people who 've seen something unusual and thought that they ought to tell someone about it , " @entity40 has said			0
the @entity10 said it examined the reports solely to determine whether enemy aircraft had infiltrated @entity11 airspace			2
once it was determined that no enemy aircraft were in the sky , it did not investigate further			0
" the @entity10 has no other interest or role regarding @entity5 matters and does not consider questions regarding the existence or otherwise of extraterrestrial life - forms , " it said in may			2
that left many incidents unexplained .			0
