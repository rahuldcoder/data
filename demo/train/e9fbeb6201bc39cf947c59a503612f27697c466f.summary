@entity0 -- presidential candidates often lack experience in one critical area : foreign policy			1
but should she run for president in 2016 , @entity6 would have more experience on that front than any other potential presidential competitor			2
with experience , however , comes risk			0
growing global crises , some of which have festered since @entity17 's time as secretary of state , could turn what is seen as one of her assets into a liability			1
unparalleled experience of any potential presidential contender , none could match @entity17 's experience overseas			1
governors are the most disconnected to foreign policy			1
those aspiring for higher office often take international trips to learn about issues			0
senators and members of @entity34 , meanwhile , can beef up their foreign policy cred by serving on committees dealing with international affairs , formulating policies and voting on matters of war , peace and which government to support			1
but none of that compares to the experience of being directly engaged in global events			0
if @entity17 does run -- and win -- it would be quite a departure from modern - day political ascension			1
she would be the first president since @entity51 , the 15th president , to previously serve as the country 's top diplomat			0
( although it was almost a requirement closer to the founding of the country , with five of the first eight presidents being previous secretaries of state			0
) but @entity51 , who preceded @entity61 , is considered one of the worst presidents in @entity65 history			0
his failings , however , had nothing to do with his dealings with foreign policy , but with trouble at home over slavery and his reluctance to engage on the issue			1
an opening but @entity17 's opponents are sure to make her resume a liability , especially if unrest around the world continues			1
sometimes excessive experience is a liability , especially in political campaigns			0
it 's easier to talk about what you will do with no record to show than it is to explain what you 've done			0
republicans will help tell @entity17 's story , pointing out contradictions and inconsistencies at every turn			1
" it creates an opening for the @entity90 , " said @entity95 , former director of foreign policy for @entity98 's 2012 presidential run			1
@entity95 said candidates wo n't win an election on foreign policy but they sure could lose one on it			1
before @entity105 and @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 , @entity109 gaining ground in @entity111 and @entity112 , @entity90 had been homing in on the issue of @entity114 -- the 2012 attack on the @entity65 compound that killed four @entity65 including ambassador @entity117 -- insisting that @entity17 knows more than she is willing to admit and that it was her negligence as secretary of state that led to a dangerous environment for @entity65 working in @entity123			1
@entity6 : @entity125 ' bears responsibility ' in downing of @entity126 but since international hot spots are flaring , @entity90 have more material to work with and more crises at which to point blame			2
for instance , after an interview with @entity1 's " @entity134 " on sunday in which @entity17 said she was " among the most skeptical of @entity125 during the time " in the @entity142 administration , a @entity90 research organization , @entity144 , noted that it 's " too late to hit the ' reset ' button on your record with @entity105			1
" during her first months at @entity146 , @entity17 spearheaded an awkward media event in which she and then - @entity105 president @entity149 hit a gimmicky reset button to signal a new start to the @entity65 - @entity105 relationship			2
" the dilemma she faces is she was either responsible for a failed foreign policy , or she was not influential enough in the administration to right the ship , " @entity95 said			2
but @entity17 's supporters are anticipating the onslaught of foreign policy - related attacks			1
the group @entity160 , which was created by @entity17 supporters to defend her , lists 11 foreign policy - related accomplishments on its website , including helping " restore @entity65 's leadership and standing in the world , " building a coalition to enact " the toughest sanctions in @entity169 's history , " playing " an integral role " in the missile reduction start treaty with @entity105 , and supporting the raid to kill @entity173			1
correct the @entity178 also says @entity17 " helped avert all - out war in @entity108 " with a cease - fire in 2012			2
a tricky paradox but responding to @entity90 attacks is only one part of @entity17 's challenge to protect and defend her record			1
she is also undertaking the difficult dance of distancing herself from president @entity142 's policies while promoting her own , especially as @entity90 continue to tie @entity17 to what they say is @entity142 's failed foreign policy			1
@entity17 is more hawkish than @entity142 , but working for a president includes having to put your policy positions aside if they do n't agree			2
with possibly higher political aspirations , @entity17 must distinguish her positions from those of her former boss			0
she wrote a 596 - page book to do just that			0
she used the opportunity to frame the narrative after the events happened , when context and the outcome of her decisions were apparent			0
regarding @entity105 , in her memoir " @entity213 , " she placed herself in a category within the administration that had more modest expectations , which included progress on some priorities " the reset delivered			0
" @entity17 portrayed her role in negotiations between @entity107 and @entity216 as a constant broker able to maintain an honest relationship with @entity107 prime minister @entity219 as his and @entity142 's relationship " continued to deteriorate			2
" @entity17 wrote about phone calls she had with @entity219 in which they " argued frequently " for more than an hour , " sometimes two			0
" after failing to extend the freeze on settlement expansion , @entity17 wrote , " i spent much of the rest of 2011 trying to keep the situation from deteriorating from deadlock into disaster			0
" @entity17 : settlement policy my biggest complaint with @entity107 government now that @entity107 and the @entity216 are engaged in intense fighting , @entity17 promoted her role as secretary of state while defending the president in her interview on @entity1			2
" i think the president is doing what he can do to try to get a cease - fire and then see whether we can sort out some , you know , longer - term resolution , " she said			0
but @entity248 , with the @entity249 , said @entity17 's role at @entity146 is not necessarily an asset but definitely not a liability			1
if the world is relatively quiet by the time 2016 rolls around , foreign policy will be at the bottom of most @entity65 ' priority list			2
@entity248 said he admires @entity17 for her work in difficult circumstances under a president who did n't give her a lot of latitude			0
he said she was a good secretary of state who improved @entity65 's image around the world but that she is n't " in the category of slam dunk secretaries of state			0
" " there is not a foreign policy crisis that is currently ongoing that you can directly blame @entity6 for , " he said			2
that does n't mean her opponents wo n't try , though			0
why many liberals do n't trust @entity6			0

should she run , @entity17 will have more foreign policy experience than any potential rival
@entity90 will help tell the story , pointing out contradictions and inconsistencies at every turn
