-- @entity2 's national football team may not have made it to the @entity4 in @entity5 -- but one man will be there for his @entity9 nation			1
stepping into the role of representing @entity2 is @entity11 , the country 's first linesman to officiate at the beautiful game 's biggest event			1
" football is my life , football has made my life change a big deal , " @entity15 tells @entity0			1
like many a young boy , @entity15 became obsessed with football , often walking vast distances so he could get to a tv to watch a match			1
yet despite his passion for the game , he wanted nothing to do with refereeing and for good reason			0
" those times it was hard because a match would hardly finish without a referee being beaten , " he explains			2
" the fans were rowdy and you know , the facilities were not very good			0
" " you were playing in open fields so the referee could be attacked anytime so when i could see that as a young boy , i did n't love it			0
" however , by the time @entity15 became a linesman in 1998 at the age of 21 , the game had changed dramatically as more resources and education had been funneled into the sport			2
" once you decide you want to become a football referee there are three pillars			2
one is your medical fitness , two is your physical fitness and then three , the technical fitness , so these can not be compromised			1
" by 2006 , the ambitious referee got his big break refereeing a game in the @entity59 before making his international debut as an assistant referee for @entity62 just two years later			0
today he holds the accolade of " best assistant referee " in the @entity59 and his talent has taken him to sun - kissed shores of @entity68 for the @entity69 , where he has been performing as a reserve assistant referee			1
the 37 - year - old knows this will be the biggest test of his career so far and is prepared to have the eyes of millions of football fans scrutinizing his every decision			0
" referees have to make decisions in the shortest time possible			0
i see it once but you , on tv , will see it and see a replay and you can even pause with technology and even review , " he says			0
" as a referee i only have one angle to look at that ... so the challenge that we have as referees , the biggest one , is how to place yourself at the right position and the right moment to make that very important , crucial decision			0
" check out the video below to find out how @entity15 prepared for his greatest moment to date and earned his dream job officiating at this year 's @entity69 .			1
