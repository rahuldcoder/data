@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 on thursday passed a bill that removes limits on financial damages that can be awarded for accidents off the @entity9 coastline , such as the explosion of the @entity12 oil rig that killed 11 workers			1
the bill updates maritime laws that have been on the books since the mid- 1800s and early 1920s			2
those laws restricted the amount of money families could obtain to compensate for lost wages and funeral expenses			2
the bill passed by the @entity3 thursday would allow compensation for non-monetary losses such as pain and suffering			1
a similar measure awaits action in the @entity27			2
also thursday , the @entity29 and @entity28 issued a directive to @entity31 on how the company should manage recovered oil , contaminated materials and waste recovered in cleanup operations from the oil disaster in the @entity38			1
among other requirements , the directive requires the oil giant to give the @entity28 and state agencies access to any waste storage site and to provide specific plans , waste reports and tracking systems for liquid and solid waste			1
" while the states of @entity1 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 are overseeing @entity31 's waste management activities and conducting inspections , this action today is meant to compliment their activities by providing further oversight and imposing more specific requirements , " the @entity29 said thursday			1
" under the directive , @entity28 , in addition to sampling already being done by @entity31 , will begin sampling the waste to help verify that the waste is being properly managed			1
" waste sampling to date has been done in compliance with @entity28 and state regulatory requirements , the @entity29 said			1
the @entity28 on thursday also released results from its first round of toxicity testing on eight oil dispersants , including @entity68 , which is being used in the @entity38			1
in may , the @entity28 had asked @entity31 to stop using @entity68 and to substitute other , less toxic alternatives on the market			1
@entity31 declined to change dispersant , arguing that it was the best one for the job			1
the study showed that none of the eight dispersants tested displayed significant endocrine disrupting activity , the @entity28 said			1
damage to the endocrine system is harmful to sea life , and can create reproductive problems			2
the agency conducted the testing to ensure that " decisions about ongoing dispersant use in the @entity38 continue to be grounded in the best available science , " the @entity28 said			1
of the dispersants tested , @entity68 and one called @entity87 were generally less toxic to small fish , and @entity87 and @entity90 were least toxic to mysid shrimp , the @entity28 said			1
" we want to ensure that every tool is available to mitigate the impact of the @entity31 spill and protect our fragile wetlands , " epa administrator @entity92 said			1
" but we continue to direct @entity31 to use dispersants responsibly and in as limited an amount as possible			1
" meanwhile , rough seas in the wake of @entity106 kept oil skimming boats out of the @entity38 on thursday and could keep many tied up through the weekend , the retired admiral in charge of the federal response to the @entity38 oil disaster said			2
@entity108 , briefing reporters in civilian garb after retiring from the @entity29 on wednesday , said seas over 5 feet hinder the effectiveness of most boats used to scoop oil			1
all but the largest vessels will likely be idled for another three days , he said			2
" in general , we 're waiting for the weather to abate so we can continue with recovery operations , " he said			2
a ship billed as the world 's largest skimming vessel has arrived in the @entity38 and was awaiting approval to begin cleaning , according to a spokesman for the @entity125 company that owns it			2
the @entity127 arrived in the @entity38 on wednesday and was anchored in @entity128 , @entity1 , about an hour south of @entity0			2
@entity130 , a spokesman for ship owner tmt shipping , said it is still awaiting approval to join the effort			0
@entity108 said the vessel -- estimated to be able to skim up to 21 million gallons a day -- is awaiting testing			0
that capacity is at least 250 times the amount that the modified fishing boats currently conducting skimming operations have been able to contain , the company says			0
built this year , the @entity127 was initially designed to be one of the largest cargo vessels afloat			0
it was completed at a @entity145 shipyard for transporting crude oil and iron ore			0
however , @entity130 said in the statement , when the disaster unfolded , @entity149 modified the vessel to become the world 's first large - scale skimmer			0
" we 're anxious to find out how effective it will be , " @entity108 said			0
he cautioned that the area of the slick in which the ship will be most effective is a " congested " site above the ruptured @entity31 well , which could make it harder to operate the 1,000 - foot - plus vessel , but added , " anything that 's effective we 're looking forward to using			2
" @entity106 hit the @entity165 coast , more than 600 miles from the center of the @entity38 disaster , on wednesday night with 105 mph winds			0
it had diminished to a tropical storm by thursday afternoon , but it continued to stir up seas of 6 to 8 feet around the site of the 10 - week - old disaster and forced the postponement of a planned overflight of the area by @entity29 rear adm. @entity177			1
and the system 's prevailing winds have affected the direction of the oil slick , steering it away from the western @entity182 toward the environmentally sensitive @entity51 and @entity183 sounds off the coast of @entity51 and @entity1 , @entity177 said			0
researchers have estimated that between 35,000 barrels ( about 1.5 million gallons ) and 60,000 barrels ( about 2.5 million gallons ) of oil have been gushing into the @entity38 every day since april 20 , when the @entity12 rig exploded and sank off the coast of @entity1			0
in other efforts , the @entity189 said thursday it was sending a silver - colored blimp to aid in oil disaster efforts			0
the blimp , known as the @entity194 , will fly slowly over the region in order to view the area where the oil is flowing and how it is coming ashore			0
it can also direct oil skimming operations			0
it was on the way to the @entity202 from @entity203 on thursday , the @entity189 said			0
in @entity205 , @entity50 , meanwhile , the official tapped to oversee the payment of claims for damages from @entity31 said he is working to speed up the process and get longer - term payments to those affected			1
@entity212 , the attorney who handled a similar process after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on @entity215 and @entity216 , said after a meeting with @entity50 gov. @entity218 that " time is the enemy			0
" " this is life for many people , in terms of their financial instability and the need for financial certainty , " he said			0
" we do not have a lot of time			0
" @entity212 said @entity218 has suggested that affected residents get lump - sum payments for up to six months ' worth of lost income rather than month - to - month payments , and " that is what we plan to do			0
" @entity2 's @entity237 , @entity238 , @entity239 and @entity240 contributed to this report .			0
