-- good news for everyone out there who 's ever thought to themselves : " a 10 - minute video of my cat eating ribs on the kitchen floor is just too short			2
" @entity9 announced thursday that it has increased its upload limit from 10 minutes to 15 for non-partners			1
so get kitty lookin ' pretty and start rolling ! so why add the extra five - spot now ? well , on the @entity9 blog , the video - sharing site explains that it 's been beefing up its copyright protection tools of late , i.e. the @entity16 ( which lets copyright holders have more control over their content )			1
therefore , it 's less likely that users can , say , upload large chunks of movies and tv shows without permission			2
in celebration of this added time , @entity9 is also launching a contest of sorts called " @entity30			1
" basically , all users have to do is film a 15 - minute vid , tag it with " yt15minutes , " and upload it by wednesday , august 4			0
the chosen videos will be featured on the @entity9 homepage			0
we wonder what effect -- if any -- this new time limit will have on initiatives like @entity40			0
do you think the extra five minutes will equate to better content , or merely more room to rant about video games , @entity45 and the like ? let us know ! Â© 2010 @entity0			0
