@entity0 -- president @entity2 on tuesday signed the most sweeping overhaul of @entity5 's food safety system since 1938			1
the legislation gives the federal @entity7 the authority to impose new rules to prevent contamination and allows the agency to order , rather than simply suggest , the recall of tainted foods			1
it also authorizes the creation of a food tracking system to quickly pinpoint the source of outbreaks			2
the legislation requires producers to assess ways in which their products could be contaminated and to take steps to prevent such problems			0
it also requires importers to verify the safety of all foods they bring into the country			2
the result will be a fundamental shift in the @entity7 's approach to food safety from reacting to foodborne illness outbreaks to preventing contamination in the first place , agency commissioner @entity30 said			1
@entity42 secretary @entity41 said in a telephone briefing on the bill monday that the legislation will give the @entity7 power for the first tiime to require proven , science - based policies that will reduce contamination of food grown and produced both in the @entity5 and abroad			1
most food safety experts agree that the legislation will ultimately make breakfast , lunch and dinner safer for @entity5			1
but the most immediate impact may be higher food prices , said @entity55 , a professor of environmental health sciences at the @entity57			0
" in the near term , we may see some of the cost of implementing this bill passed on to consumers , " he said			0
that may be the most tangible aspect of the legislation for most people , @entity55 said			0
while the legislation will help improve safety practices , most of its work will be invisible to consumers , who likely will notice few changes in food packaging or retailing , @entity55 said			2
" i think it will mostly be operating behind the scenes , " @entity55 said			0
" and if it stays behind the scenes , that may be a good thing			0
" any impacts consumers might notice are likely to be felt no sooner than three years from now , @entity84 predicted , when @entity7 regulators finish writing rules required by the legislation and begin implementing them			2
and that is only if the @entity7 gets the money needed to implement the bill 's many provisions from a divided @entity93 already set to argue over reducing the ballooning federal budget deficit			1
the @entity95 estimated the bill 's provision would increase net government spending on food safety by $ 1.4 billion over five years			1
@entity100 told reporters monday that she is optimistic @entity93 will provide the necessary resources to implement the bill 's key provisions			0
here 's what to eventually expect from the new bill : -- swifter food recalls			2
under the bill , the @entity7 will have to give companies a chance to recall an unsafe food , but if they refuse to act , the agency will be allowed to issue a recall on its own			1
most food producers work well with the @entity7 , eager to protect the public and their own brands , @entity100 told reporters monday			2
but there have been some instances where regulators had to apply pressure from states or even the courts to get companies to agree to a recall , she said			0
the new power to issue direct recalls will eliminate those problems , she said			1
the legislation also makes it easier for regulators to stop potentially tainted foods from moving through distribution channels or even shut down a food processing facility that 's the suspected source of contaminated food , according to the @entity7			1
the agency will also be required to improve its ability to track food as it moves around the supply chain , making it easier to trace an outbreak back to its source			0
the legislation requires the @entity7 to create a searchable database on its website naming each product under recall and the status of the recall			2
the bill requires the @entity7 to inspect high - risk food processing facilities at least once in the next five years and every three years after that			1
the @entity7 also is required to inspect 600 overseas facilities in the next year , and double the number of those inspections annually for the next five years			2
the legislation requires all imported foods to meet @entity7 food - safety standards			1
about 15 percent of the @entity5 food supply , including 60 percent of fresh fruits and vegetables and 80 percent of seafood , is imported , according to the @entity7			1
-- greater responsibility for food producers			2
the bill requires producers to evaluate hazards to their products posed by people , animals and the environment , create measures to prevent contamination and to develop written food safety plans			1
it also requires the @entity7 to develop scientific standards for producers to use in the safe production and harvesting of fruits and vegetables			0
advocates argued the legislation , pushed through in the waning days of a lame duck @entity93 in december , was much needed to protect the food supply against intentional tampering and reduce the incidence of foodborne illness			0
the @entity195 estimated recently that one out of every six @entity5 gets sick from foodborne illnesses each year , and 3,000 die			0
some consumer and food safety advocates have argued the legislation does not give the @entity7 enough enforcement authority , such as the ability to file criminal charges against procuders who knowingly distribute contaminated products			1
but most experts support the new legislation			0
" everyone who eats will benefit from this historic legislation , " @entity208 , executive director of @entity209 , said in a statement following congressional approval of the legislation in december			0
" @entity7 will have new tools to help ensure that @entity5 's food supply is safer , causing fewer illnesses and deaths			1
" the bill is widely considered to be the most significant overhaul in @entity5 government oversight of the food supply since the 1938 passage of the @entity224			1
that legislation established authority for government inspection of food processing facilities and authorized standards for food quality , labeling and food additives			0
among other things , it 's also the law that gives most food colorings their name			0
its approval was spurred by a 1937 crisis in which 107 people died from ingesting a medical ingredient , according to the @entity7			0
@entity1 's @entity243 , @entity244 and @entity245 contributed to this report .			0
