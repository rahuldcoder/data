-- not just your basic , average everyday , ordinary , run - of - the - mill , ho - hum fairy tale , " @entity11 " is a dazzler very nearly from first to last , a live action film that rivals the best recent animated features for imagination and wit			1
@entity13 and @entity14 star in the imaginative " @entity11			1
" indeed , at a pinch you might describe it as " @entity17 " for grown - ups --- though i 've a suspicion the great @entity20 filmmaker @entity19 ( " @entity21 " ) may have been a more important inspiration			2
the movie combines many of the archetypes of a classic bedtime story			2
first , there 's @entity28 ( @entity14 ) , an intrepid young hero from the wrong side of the tracks ( or so he thinks ) , embarking on a romantic quest to bring back a fallen star as a token of his love for beautiful , aloof @entity36 ( @entity35 )			1
this quest takes him from an @entity38 village -- " @entity45 " -- into another land , @entity40 , a magical realm where the star in question has transformed into @entity44 ( @entity13 )			1
she 's blonde and grumpy , but obviously a better bet than you - know - who -- if only @entity28 would stop mooning over the girl he left behind			2
@entity40 is home to a rapidly dwindling family of fratricidal princes vying for the throne			0
the last men standing , @entity56 and @entity57 ( @entity55 and @entity58 ) are also after the star , glumly observed from the monochromatic sidelines by their five murdered brothers			0
then there 's the wicked witch @entity64 ( @entity65 ) and her two evil sisters			1
their magic is on the wane , but a fresh injection of stardust will restore their youth and vitality			0
@entity64 means to intercept @entity44 , pluck out her heart and eat it raw			0
fava beans apparently are optional			0
adapted from @entity79 's novel by @entity80 and director @entity81 , " @entity11 " gets off to a false start with a prologue told in such broad strokes it comes off as crude and supercilious , even with no less a personage than sir @entity87 narrating			1
but this richly plotted , thumpingly scored story settles into a groove as soon as @entity44 enters the picture and the chase is on			0
cut from the same slightly damp cloth as @entity94 , @entity14 is dashing and bumbling in roughly equal measure -- a quintessentially @entity38 combination that will either have you swooning or groaning			1
as usual , @entity13 radiates intelligence , but struggles with the naivet√© required to offset her character 's crankiness			1
whatever you make of the young folk , there 's no question that the real star power emanates from a delectably witchy @entity65 and @entity108 , very droll as a pirate captain by the name of @entity111 who has a surprising skeleton in his closet			1
it 's also the case that they have the best props			0
apparently having the time of her life at 48 ( she 's already been a hoot in " hairspray " ) , @entity65 clearly savors playing a woman who ages another notch with every spell she casts			1
@entity108 , for his part , mans the helm of an airship that 's part galleon , part zeppelin , and he smuggles lightning bolts for a living			2
this elaborate strain of fantasy meshes easily enough with a cheeky , @entity136 sense of humor , even if the mild ribaldry makes it a questionable proposition for kids			0
still , this handsomely produced movie marks a significant step up in scale and accomplishment for @entity146 's producer , @entity81 , whose only previous directing effort was the gangster thriller " @entity149			0
" for a generation that grew up on " @entity152 , " it 's got to feel like a long - overdue happy ending			0
" @entity11 " is rated @entity154 and runs 128 minutes			2
for @entity156 's take , click here			0

" @entity11 " a terrific *adventure*
