-- @entity1 still remembers the sound of wood popping as his house 's attic burned			1
his brother , he says , had tried to set the home ablaze with eight people inside			1
he also remembers the time when his mother awakened to a ghastly sight : his brother standing over her with a butcher knife			2
and he remembers the message his brother sent him on @entity14 , threatening to kill him			2
when he heard that his brother , @entity15 , had been accused of opening fire with an @entity17 inside a @entity19 elementary school this week , @entity1 said he was just " a little bit " surprised			1
" over the years of growing up with him , it almost seemed like eventually he would do something like this , " he told @entity0 's @entity21 in an exclusive interview thursday			1
" but not to this magnitude			0
" authorities allege that @entity1 , 20 , had about 500 rounds of ammunition when he entered the @entity31 outside @entity32 on tuesday			1
he barricaded himself in the front office , fired one shot inside the school and several more at police officers outside before he eventually surrendered , police said			2
ultimately , no one was injured			0
how did it come to this ? @entity1 suggests that the system failed his family			1
" i feel like there 's just a whole lot more they could have done , " he told @entity0			1
he said his younger brother used to be a normal kid			2
" everything just started changing after doctors started messing with his medicines here and there and changing it up and putting him on a different one and institutionalized him multiple times to correct his medicine , " he said			0
" it just escalated from there			0
" as the years went by , @entity1 said he and other family members felt increasingly helpless			1
" i felt hopeless at helping him , " he said			0
" i tried many times growing up as a teenager to sit him down an talk to him			0
" but his advice never stuck			0
and earlier this year , his brother was arrested in march on a charge of " terroristic threats and acts " after threatening to kill him			2
after pleading guilty to that charge , @entity15 was sentenced in july to serve three years of probation and attend anger management classes as part of a plea agreement , according to @entity78 court records			1
it 's not clear whether he started the classes			0
@entity78 district attorney @entity81 said wednesday there is no indication he has completed them			0
@entity1 said thursday that he is n't sure whether he 'll ever speak to his brother again			1
he said hopes the situation will be a reminder to people in the political , mental health and legal systems that more needs to be done			0
people like his brother " need to be looked at more closely , " he said			0
