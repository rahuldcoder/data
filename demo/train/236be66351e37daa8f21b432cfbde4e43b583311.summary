-- @entity1 was inconsolable after seeing her pet cat crushed to death at @entity5 's @entity4 as the creature was loaded onto a flight to @entity8			1
" you see a crowd forming round her but she is given no medical aid and no one does anything , " @entity1 says of the march 23 incident			2
her grief soon turned to rage among tens of thousands of online pet lovers worldwide			2
the day after @entity1 's cat , @entity20 , died , a friend published online an open letter to @entity22 , the international airline that had been carrying the cat			1
the letter demanded a full explanation and apology from the privately owned @entity27 airline and blasted its " insensitive " handling of the tragedy and pet travel procedures			1
the blog post spread quickly across social media sites and within 24 hours had 20,000 hits from across the world			0
hundreds of furious animal lovers also unleashed @entity37 fury at @entity22 , forcing the airline to issue two public statements on @entity40			1
@entity1 , 26 , a brand strategist , paid rs 4,500 ( us $ 83 ) to fly her rescued @entity27 street cat called @entity20 on her flight			1
she got engaged last august and moved to @entity8 six months ago to be with her fiancÃ © but left her pet with friends in @entity5 while she sorted out the paperwork and quarantine			1
after check - in , @entity1 was asked to remove @entity20 from the cage so it could be x-rayed			1
the cat immediately escaped @entity1 's grip and scuttled under the machine			1
half an hour later @entity1 got her cat back inside the @entity56 - approved cage			1
she added an extra wire on top , double checked it was locked and handed her to the staff			0
but her biggest nightmare came while waiting at the gate to board her 8.55 a.m. flight			0
@entity22 staff approached her and informed her : " the cage is empty			1
the cat is no more			0
" shocked , she broke down in tears and refused to board the flight demanding to see her one - year - old kitty			0
after having her @entity70 bottle of gin confiscated , she was escorted back to check - in where she was handed her beloved cat 's corpse in its cage			1
@entity22 staff then tried to escort her out of the airport but she demanded to see the @entity78 footage			2
after waiting for two hours , she watched in horror as footage showed her cat jumping out of a luggage trolley onto the tarmac and being run over by a trolley coming in the opposite direction			2
" she squirms a bit and then dies			0
three airline staff stand around and they motion to a garbage man to pick her , " @entity1 says , speaking from @entity8			1
" he picks her up with newspaper by the neck and drops her into the cage			0
" more than 300 people have since signed a petition calling for better training of @entity22 staff on handling pets and better infrastructure for pet travel			1
a @entity22 spokesperson tells @entity0 : " on close inspection of the container , it was observed that the wire mesh in the front of the container was bent outwards and pushed out of the main frame			2
" it is inferred that the pet forced itself out of the container by pushing the wire mesh and thereby creating a gap for it to come free			0
" @entity1 insists negligence by @entity22 caused the death of her cat			1
" i think either the cage was thrown so violently onto the trolley that it snapped open , or someone let her out			2
there is no way my cat could have pushed the cage open by herself , " she says			2
@entity1 now wants @entity22 to apologize not just for the incident but the " insensitive way " she claims she was treated , being left alone shaking and crying for hours			1
she also wants the airline to tell her what steps they are taking to improve pet travel safety			0
" i do n't want any compensation			0
they should make a donation to an animal organization , " she adds			0
" they should have a vet present at the airport and an animal handler to accompany the pet to the aircraft			0
" the @entity22 spokesperson says the airline has embarked on a global review of other airport and airline procedures			2
the spokesperson said : " we sincerely regret the accidental demise of @entity20 , pet cat of ms. @entity1			1
all our staff are fully conversant and trained in the process of handling household pets and necessary infrastructure is available at the airports to deal with such movements of pets			0
" if the actions of any members of our team came across as insensitive we would like to assure that this was unintentional and to apologize to ms. @entity1			0
" @entity159 , who runs pet relocation service @entity161 in @entity27 , which flies 40 - 50 pets in and out of @entity27 each month , said she had never heard of an incident like this			0
but she added : " pet travel is still in a very nascent stage in @entity27			0
airlines are trying to put their best foot forward but there still is a lot of room for improvement because @entity27 itself is not a very pet - friendly country , " she said .			0
