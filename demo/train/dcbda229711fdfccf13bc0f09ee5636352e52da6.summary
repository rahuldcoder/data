carrying what @entity5 calls its most precise instrument yet for measuring rain and snowfall			1
the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) satellite is the first of five earth science launches @entity5 has planned for 2014			1
the 4 - ton spacecraft is the most sophisticated platform yet for measuring rainfall , capable of recording amounts as small as a hundredth of an inch an hour , said @entity20 , @entity10 's deputy project scientist			2
the $ 900 million satellite is a joint project with the @entity2 space agency @entity23 , and it lifted off from @entity24 at 3:37 a.m. friday ( 1:37 p.m. thursday et )			1
in a little over a half hour , it had reached orbit , deployed its solar panels and began beaming signals back to its controllers , @entity5 said			2
also , once fully activated , @entity10 will use both radar and microwave instruments to detect falling snow for the first time			0
it will also combine data from other satellites with its own readings , beaming back a snapshot of worldwide precipitation every three hours , @entity33 said			0
" we can start using the data for all sorts of applications -- for floods , for landslide predictions , for tracking hurricanes so we know what part of the coastline to evacuate , " @entity33 said			0
that data will boost not only immediate storm forecasts , but also aid climate scientists who have been working on long - term models of a changing world			1
" we can start validating and verifying what the scientists are saying from the models that say we 're going to have more extreme precipitation , " she said			0
" where there 's heavy precipitation now , the climate models are saying there 'll continue to be more intense precipitation there , and where there 's droughts , they think the droughts will be more intense			0
" the craft has enough fuel for at least five years and is expected to last longer -- so when combined with earlier missions , it will give @entity5 an unbroken 25 - to 30 - year rainfall record , @entity33 said .			2

satellite will beam back the most precise measurements of rain and snow yet
it is launched in @entity2
@entity5 says it will help both short - term forecasts and long - term climate projections
