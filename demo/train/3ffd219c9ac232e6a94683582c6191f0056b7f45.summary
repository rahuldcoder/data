-- rousted out of bed by an early morning phone call , @entity1 stood in the rain and watched her church burn			2
" we had choir practice wednesday night , and then thursday morning , it 's gone , " she said			1
" not even 12 hours later			2
" despite the efforts of firefighters from @entity1 's town of @entity13 , @entity14 , and beyond , @entity9 was a total loss			1
the blaze was one in a string of 11 fires in east @entity14 churches this year			1
eight have been ruled arson , leaving residents and churches on edge as authorities work to find the person -- or persons -- responsible			1
" we certainly can connect several of them , " said @entity27 , special agent with the @entity29 ' @entity28 , @entity14 , office			1
two fires that broke out monday had not been ruled arson as of wednesday , but are considered suspicious , he said			1
there is no clear theme linking the fires , which have struck various church denominations -- @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 -- on different days of the week and at different times of the day , he said			1
and while the churches are in small towns -- such as @entity13 , which has a population of about 3,800 people -- not all the fires were in remote locations , @entity27 said			1
authorities believe one person , or perhaps a group of people , are responsible			2
investigators have " people we 're looking at " from tips called in , but " nothing specific yet , " he said			2
" i think maybe i would characterize the mood of our people as perplexed , " said @entity56 , mayor of @entity57 , @entity14 , a town of about 12,000 that has seen three of the church fires			1
" ... i think most people would just wonder who could be doing this or even why			2
most people consider it just incomprehensible and unconscionable that somebody could and would be doing this			2
" the fires have been a blow , he said , especially in east @entity14 , which has " a faithful , church - going people			1
" included in the total of 11 is a january church arson in @entity76 , @entity14 , @entity27 said			1
authorities are not sure if it is related to the others , as @entity76 is more than 150 miles away from the area east of @entity28 where most of the fires have occurred			1
however , the @entity29 is in contact with investigators on that fire , he said			2
in addition , he said , one church fire from january has not been ruled arson			1
in @entity90 , @entity14 , @entity91 is " displaced , but very much alive , " the rev. @entity88 wrote on the church web site			1
" we grieve the loss of [ our ] church home , the place that we loved and shared so many memories with our church family , " he wrote			2
" it was a very special place to all of us , and our emotions at this time are varied and many			2
" @entity101 burned on january 16 , @entity88 told @entity0 wednesday , so members have had some time to process the event			1
still , he said , there is a " real feeling of violation , a real feeling of ' i never thought this would happen to me			0
' " like @entity9 , the 120 - member church was destroyed			0
" not a @entity111 , not a hymnal " was left , @entity88 said			0
" we 've got some bricks			0
" @entity40 is currently holding services in another church 's sanctuary , he said			0
@entity122 's congregation , which numbers in the hundreds , is meeting in its nearby fellowship building , @entity1 said			0
the burned building has n't been released back to the church yet , she said wednesday , although investigators had released it to insurance adjusters			1
" we had a big , beautiful sanctuary , " she said			0
" it 's a million - dollar loss			0
" members are sorrowful , she said , because the church was built by donations -- one person donated the pews , another the cushions , and members donated hymnals , including some in memory of loved ones			0
a similar string of church arsons occurred in 2006 in rural communities outside of @entity148 , @entity149			1
three college students were arrested and pleaded guilty to federal arson charges			1
two were sentenced to eight years in prison , while a third was sentenced to seven years			0
another string of suspicious church fires took place in the 1990s and led to the enactment of the 1996 @entity158 , which provided funding for investigations and assistance to congregations			1
but authorization for the act has expired , and @entity165 of the @entity166 says it should be reauthorized			0
" funding ran out , " she said			0
" by 1998 , 1999 , 2000 , the coordination efforts led by @entity169 and @entity170 , they were n't meeting anymore			0
" " if we still had that funding , then some of the people who were victimized in 1996 might not be victimized again in 2010			0
" the @entity166 tallied nearly 500 suspicious church fires from 2005 to 2008 , the last year they had complete data , including nearly 200 in 2006			1
in @entity14 , federal authorities are working with the @entity181 and the state @entity182 , as well as local police , sheriffs ' and fire departments , to investigate the blazes , @entity27 said			1
on monday , officials contacted a number of local authorities in east @entity14 , warning them about the fires and urging them to remain vigilant			1
a number of locations have beefed up police patrols near churches , he said			2
the churches themselves are " on heightened alert , i guess you would say , " said @entity56			1
some church members have been staying at their churches , while others are patrolling along with police			2
" we 're a rural area , " he said			2
" we do n't have the cameras and surveillance devices that people have			0
" some smaller churches are pooling resources to have overnight security patrols , @entity88 said , while larger churches are patrolling on a volunteer basis			1
" the community is on edge , " he said			0
" we 're certainly concerned , " said @entity90 mayor @entity212			2
in addition , she pointed out , with the current economic downturn , the burned churches will have to rebuild by using resources that could have been used to help assist others in the community			1
however , " it 's brought the community together in a lot of ways , " she said			0
churches in @entity90 held a prayer rally on january 24 to show support for the churches struck by arson			1
members are watching out for other churches as well as their own , she said			2
the @entity29 is offering a $ 25,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible , @entity27 said			0
at @entity9 , meanwhile , church members are counting their blessings in the face of tragedy			0
a large brass cross that hung over the choir loft was found and salvaged , @entity1 said			0
" it was kind of twisted , but we 're going to have it restored			0
" also found was a cross borne by acolytes during services , she said			0
members are grateful the church 's offices and records remained intact , she said , as well as the church 's set of @entity254 handbells			0
" we 're saddened , " she said			0
" but you know what , that building was not our church			0
... we 're ok , because we 're strong people , and we know that @entity260 's hand is on us and he will take care of us			0
" @entity0 's @entity262 contributed to this report .			0
