-- in a close race that saw each of the top three films swap places between friday and sunday , animated smash " @entity5 " once again won the weekend at the box office			1
the $ 76 million family film from @entity9 and @entity10 fell 46 percent from its debut weekend to $ 44.8 million , pushing its total all the way to $ 229.2 million after only 12 days			1
" @entity5 " has easily asserted its dominance over @entity16 's " @entity15 " in the last two weekends			1
though " monsters " has been in theaters twice as long ( it opened june 21 ) , its $ 237.8 million domestic total is only $ 8.6 million more than " @entity5			1
" @entity9 's minion - filled comedy should easily overtake its rival release sometime this week			0
worldwide , " @entity5 " is about to surpass " @entity15 " as well , as the films have earned $ 472.4 million and $ 474.2 million , respectively			1
in second place , @entity27 's first - ever sequel , " @entity28 , " opened to a great $ 42.5 million			1
the $ 80 million @entity31 comedy started off slightly better than its 2010 predecessor , " @entity36 , " which debuted with $ 40.5 million on the way to a $ 162 million domestic finish			0
if estimates hold up , " @entity28 " will stand as @entity27 's second - best opening ever behind 2005 ′ s " @entity39 , " which debuted to $ 47.6 million			1
review : " @entity28 " @entity27 has proven himself to be one of the most consistent box office draws in @entity42 over the last 15 years , during which time he has accrued 12 live - action hits that grossed more than $ 100 million , as well as the animated winner " @entity45 , " which topped out at $ 148.3 million			1
but after back - to - back live - action misfires with 2011 ′ s " @entity50 " ( $ 74.2 million ) and 2012 ′ s " @entity51 " ( $ 36.9 million ) , many questioned whether @entity27 's brand of comedy was still viable at the box office			1
" @entity36 2 's " impressive debut should mitigate those concerns — and put the comedy on track to become @entity27 's 14th $ 100 million movie			1
according to @entity31 , audiences for " @entity28 " were 53 percent female ( this follows " @entity61 " and " @entity62 " — two other films with unexpectedly majority - female audiences ) , and 54 percent below the age of 25			2
crowds surveyed by @entity66 issued the film a ho - hum " b " grade , and critics were largely dismissive			0
" @entity76 " opened in third place with $ 38.3 million , a difficult start for @entity73 ' $ 190 million monsters vs. robots adventure , though the best ever debut for director @entity75			1
headed into the weekend , " @entity76 's " sales on @entity78 were outpacing those of " @entity62 , " which recently opened with $ 66.4 million			1
on thursday , " @entity76 " garnered an eye - popping $ 3.6 million from shows beginning at 7:00 p.m. but the film , like many others that have targeted geeky crowds , proved extremely front - loaded in its box office returns			1
after a $ 14.6 million friday , " @entity76 " fell 13 percent on saturday to $ 12.5 million , and @entity73 expects it will fall another 15 percent today to $ 10.9 million			2
if the film 's domestic total follows the same trajectory as its opening weekend , " @entity76 " will top out right at $ 100 million			1
review : " @entity76 " that 's why @entity73 is depending on strong word of mouth to carry the film financially			2
" we 've got critics that love it , we 've got audiences — male and female — that love it , " says @entity93 , @entity73 ' president of domestic distribution , who points to " @entity76 's " encouraging " a- " @entity66 grade from crowds ( that were 61 percent male ) as a sign that the film may hold up well in weeks to come			2
" what we need to do is go aggressively into week two and broaden that audience base			0
" " @entity76 " fared particularly well in @entity114 , which accounted for 50 percent of its opening - weekend gross , the highest ratio all summer ( though still a far cry from the 70 percent @entity114 shares that were typical in 2009 and 2010 )			2
the film also played well in 331 @entity122 theaters , where it earned $ 7.3 million — a full 19 percent of its opening - weekend haul			2
internationally , " @entity76 " scored $ 53 million from 38 markets this weekend , bringing its global launch to $ 91.3 million altogether			2
the film fared best in @entity127 , where it started with $ 9.6 million , and @entity73 expects it will play well throughout @entity128 during its run			0
in fourth place , @entity130 and @entity132 's buddy cop comedy " @entity133 " dipped 44 percent to $ 14 million in its third weekend			2
the film surpassed the $ 100 million mark on friday and has now earned $ 112.4 million total against a slim $ 43 million budget			0
despite ' @entity138 ' , @entity16 will press on with ' branded tentpole strategy ' " @entity138 " was n't so lucky			0
the $ 225 million @entity140 , which last week stumbled with only $ 47.9 million in its first five days , plummeted 62 percent in its second weekend to $ 11.1 million , which gives the film $ 71.1 million and puts it on pace for a finish below $ 100 million			0
despite " @entity138 's " disappointing run , a @entity16 exec this week said the studio remains committed to a " branded tentpole strategy			0
" @entity5 " -- $ 44.8 million 2			1
" @entity28 " -- $ 42.5 million 3			1
" @entity76 " -- $ 38.3 million 4			1
" @entity133 " -- $ 14 million 5			0
" @entity138 " -- $ 11.2 million two indie releases also made waves in limited release this weekend			0
@entity159 's " @entity158 " expanded into 79 theaters and grossed $ 1.1 million , giving it a robust $ 14,051 per theater average — and guaranteeing that more theater owners will want to show the film on their screens soon			2
" @entity161 's " performance was even more impressive			0
the film , which stars @entity163 as @entity164 , the 22 - year - old @entity166 resident who was detained and shot by a police officer in 2009 , earned $ 377,000 from only seven theaters , yielding a blazing $ 53,898 average			0
@entity171 verdict : celebs rally around the late @entity173 " @entity161 's " plot and racial themes coincide with the national conversation ( and controversy ) surrounding @entity171 , who was last night found not guilty of killing @entity173			0
the debate sparked by the @entity171 trial 's verdict could propel " @entity161 , " a @entity182 release , even further than its impressive debut already suggests			0
next week , four new releases are hitting theaters , and " @entity186 , " " @entity187 , " " @entity188 " and " @entity189 " will all compete for box office supremacy			0
