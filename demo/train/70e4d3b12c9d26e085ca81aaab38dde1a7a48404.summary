-- so you want to work at @entity2 , one of the world 's hottest companies -- what do you have to get your foot in the door and get noticed ? it 's not going to be easy -- you have competition			1
@entity2 received 250,000 job applications last year and is consistently rated as one of the best places to work			1
and with @entity2 's ipo around the corner , the competition for jobs is only going to heat up			1
there are plenty of ways to get noticed and stand above the crowd , though			0
i chatted with @entity23 , head of recruiting for the social network , on what the company looks for and what it takes to get a job at @entity2			1
what jobs are available at @entity2 ? ever since @entity2 announced it was moving to a bigger office and raised $ 2 billion in funding , it has been ramping up its hiring			1
while there are many openings in legal , communications , @entity39 , marketing , online operations , business development , it , design , user experience and internationalization , the company is especially looking for technical talent , especially software engineers and product managers			1
the @entity2 interview process i actually went through the entire @entity2 interview process in 2008 , before i joined @entity0 as an associate editor			1
and while it 's definitely changed since i applied for a job on the company 's @entity57 team , the basic format has remained the same			0
the first step is almost always a recruiter phone - screening -- @entity2 will begin exploring your resume , asking you about your previous work , especially about what you 've built and what leadership roles you 've had in the past			2
sometimes there 's a second screening , depending on the role			0
if you pass the screening , the company will fly you out to its @entity72 headquarters for a series of on - site interviews with the hiring manager ( your potential future boss ) and a group of your peers -- in other words , you will be interviewed by the members of the team you 're hoping to join			0
as @entity23 explained to me , these interviews are designed to determine whether you have the skills for the job and whether you 're a cultural fit			1
the group then makes " a collective decision on whether you 're a great fit " for the position			0
the process itself greatly varies from group to group -- expect more technical skill challenges if you 're applying for an engineering job			0
oh , and one extra piece of advice from me : always put the user first in any scenario or interview question			0
standing apart from the crowd with more than a quarter of a million applicants , how does @entity2 whittle down the applicant pool ? " we 're primarily looking for builders , " @entity23 says			1
he explains that @entity2 has an entrepreneurial spirit and is a flat organization , and thus it 's looking for people who can thrive in that environment			2
employees need to be self - starters who do n't need a lot of direction , so autonomy and self - motivation are highly valued			0
builders -- especially engineers who like to build projects on their own and have cool , working products or apps they can show off -- are sought after by the @entity2 team			2
if someone builds a unique application and / or solves a problem in a way that has n't been done before , he 's going to get @entity2 's attention			2
strong applicants to @entity2 also " just get the social space , " @entity23 says			1
they not only understand the product , but can see the company 's vision			0
even more important is that they 're active users of the product			0
this may seem like a no - brainer , but @entity23 says his team finds a lot of applicants who have n't used their @entity2 accounts in weeks or even months			1
and that is a very clear sign to @entity2 that the person wo n't be a good fit			1
finally , it 's very helpful to know someone at @entity2 who can vouch for you -- this was true even when i interviewed with the social network three years ago			1
while i got special consideration due to my unique history with @entity152 and @entity2 , i still had a @entity2 reference			2
final thoughts while i ultimately failed to secure a job at @entity2 , you do n't have to let that be the case for you			2
for those of you applying to non-technical roles , be sure you 're active users , understand the company culture and have a resume filled with leadership and " builder " activities			0
it 's more impressive if you launched an organization or product than if you simply took it over			0
for technical talent , the best thing you can do is build something			1
if you build a really impressive @entity173 application that gains some traction , you 're going to get noticed			0
if you are a major contributor of open source code to various projects , you 're going to get noticed			0
in the end though , the big filter is cultural fit			1
there is n't really much you can do to prepare for that -- the @entity2 team simply knows if you 're going to mesh well with them or if you 're not going to be able to keep up			2
and as i said before , be sure to have an employee refer you			0
otherwise , you 're going to have a really difficult time just getting the phone screening			0

the company is especially looking for technical talent
strong applicants to @entity2 " just get the social space , " @entity23 says
in the end , the big filter is cultural fit
