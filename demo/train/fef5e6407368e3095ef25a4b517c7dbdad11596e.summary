maybe it 's not surprising that in @entity3 's hometown of @entity4 , an online poll showed overwhelming support for the theme park in light of a recent documentary that has raised questions about its treatment of killer whales			1
what has turned heads , though , is the fact that more than half of the votes appeared to have come from a computer , or computers , at @entity3 itself			1
the @entity21 documentary " @entity32 " traces the controversial history of killer whales in captivity , leading up to the 2010 killing of @entity3 trainer @entity26 by the 12,000 - pound orca @entity27 , a whale previously associated with the death of two other people			1
on december 31 , the @entity33 posted an unscientific poll asking , " has @entity21 's ' @entity32 ' documentary changed your perception of @entity3 ? " by midday thursday , the paper reported , an overwhelming 99 % of respondents said " no , " their opinion of the beloved park had not changed			1
what the @entity33 discovered upon a closer look , though , was that 54 % of those 328 votes had been cast from a single @entity45 ( @entity47 ) address			1
an ip address is an identifier that can represent either a single computer or a connected network of them			0
the address in this case ? @entity55			0
" not sure if this will become another belly flop for the theme park giant , but this surely could n't have been part of its public relations campaign , " the @entity33 's @entity56 wrote in a story exposing the vote			2
the survey results have since swerved the other way			0
by midday friday , 70 % of the poll 's more than 1,700 respondents had said " yes , " with only 30 % saying no. @entity3 denies that the flood of " no " votes from its computers was a case of digital ballot - box stuffing			1
" it 's important to note we have more than 6,000 team members in @entity4 , between three parks and our company headquarters , " spokesman @entity74 said in an email to @entity21			1
" i think anyone would expect that an @entity4 publication would be read and responded to by some of those team members			2
... " our team members have strong feelings about their park and company and we encourage them to make their opinions known			2
if a poll is posted regarding @entity3 , our team members have as much a right as anyone else to vote and express their opinion			2
we 're unsure why that 's being questioned here			0
" in a statement to the @entity33 , @entity74 specifically denied using a " bot " to cast votes in the poll			0
a " bot " is an automated tool that can be set up on a computer to perform a repetitive task , like voting repeatedly in a digital poll			0
" @entity32 , " directed by @entity32 and acquired by @entity21 at the @entity104 , first aired on october 24			2
since then , @entity3 has faced a considerable public - relations backlash			0
musicians including @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 have canceled planned concert appearances at the park while other artists , like @entity115 and @entity116 , have asked that their music no longer be used in shows featuring the sound - sensitive orcas			0
an online petition at @entity123 asking country singer and " @entity126 " winner @entity125 to cancel a march 1 show there has nearly 30,000 signatures			0
@entity3 has said " @entity32 " focuses on a small handful of events from the park 's 39 - year history and ignores the park 's contributions to education , preservation and animal research .			1

@entity3 computers poured votes into an online poll about the park
@entity4 paper asked whether @entity21 's " @entity32 " film had changed opinions
more than half of early votes traced to an internet address were from @entity47
the park says concerned *employees* are *responsible* for the votes
