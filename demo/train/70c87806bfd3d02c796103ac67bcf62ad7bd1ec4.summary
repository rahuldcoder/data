the @entity1 administration is promising a much smoother ride on @entity3 come saturday , but insurers worry that behind - the - scenes glitches will keep consumers from enrolling in the health insurance plans they want			1
insurance industry insiders tell @entity10 that when some people sign up for coverage through the website , their personal data is not being properly transmitted to the insurance companies of their choosing			1
insurers are still getting inaccurate and duplicative data			1
and that 's even if it makes it to them at all			2
so how do insurers know they are n't getting the information ? customers who signed up for coverage are calling the companies with questions and finding they are n't in their systems			0
and insurers have been testing the site , submitting @entity34 records and not seeing them come out the other end , an industry official said			2
" there 's no part of us that thinks all of this will be fixed in three days from now , " the industry official said , referring to the administration 's self - imposed saturday deadline to make the site work for a " vast majority " of users			1
another insurance industry insider was more blunt , saying : " it 's still all jacked up			2
" @entity47 , a spokesman for the insurance trade group @entity48 , was more circumspect			0
" there is still a lot of work to be done to make sure that enrollments can be done and processed accurately , " he said			0
if the problems are n't fixed , insurers fear a worst - case scenario where consumers sign up for insurance through the website and think they 're enrolled , only to find out at the doctor 's office that they do n't have any coverage			1
@entity61 : enroll in @entity62 , but not too fast insures are warily watching to see how the administration talks about the site following this saturday 's deadline to improve it			1
" if they come out and claim victory over the weekend , it 's just not true , " the industry insider said			2
" the question is , can you guarantee that someone who 's gone through this process and signed up will have coverage january 1 ? as of today , the honest answer would be no. " the administration said it has made good progress on a fix to the federal online portal for consumers to purchase coverage under the @entity62 following its rocky -- and politically charged -- rollout in october			1
@entity84 to take up @entity62 contraception case consumers who pick a plan by december 23 and pay their premium by december 31 will have coverage effective january 1 , said @entity90 , a spokesman for the @entity91 , a key player working to repair the site			1
" when a consumer selects a plan and enrolls in marketplace coverage , an orange message is clearly displayed letting them know that they must make payment to be covered			0
a consumer will receive contact from their issuer about how to make payment			0
if they do not receive that notice , and are uncertain if their enrollment has been processed , they should contact the issuer , " he said			0
one insurance executive said the industry is raising its voice now about the problems because officials are trying to set low expectations and avoid blame should problems persist beyond saturday			0
" the insurance industry , of which i 'm a part and can say this pretty confidently , the insurance industry is making it worse than it is , " the executive said			2
" but it 's still a problem			0
" @entity126 : @entity62 website improvements ' on track '			0
