thousands of angry protesters poured into the streets of the @entity3 's capital friday			1
the target of their rage ? peacekeepers sent to protect them			2
two people were fatally shot , according to the @entity11 - led peacekeeping force , known as @entity12 , when peacekeepers opened fire as their base came under attack in @entity17			1
tensions have been high in @entity17 for months			1
but they erupted this week after an attack wednesday on a church that killed at least 17 people , according to the @entity24 refugee agency			2
another 27 civilians were reportedly abducted by assailants and remain unaccounted for , the @entity24 agency said			2
it said the church , @entity29 , was housing 9,000 internally displaced people at the time of the attack			0
they included some 2,050 people who had moved there only a week ago to escape trouble in nearby neighborhoods , the refugee agency said			2
some of those killed and injured in the church attack were taken wednesday evening to @entity17 's @entity41 , where medical personnel battled to save them			1
in the emergency room , a priest and a 15 - year - old boy arrived as patients but did not survive			0
other victims were driven straight to the morgue			0
two children were among those killed , the refugee agency said			0
burning tires , barricades it 's not clear who attacked the @entity56 of @entity29			0
but the @entity58 area borders the unstable " @entity66 " neighborhood , where the last remaining group of @entity61 in the capital live , trapped and under siege from @entity65 militia groups			1
according to witnesses , an armed group burst into the church wednesday afternoon , shooting people in and around the area			0
immediately afterward , angry young men responded to the attack by installing barricades around @entity17			1
@entity75 rose as the youths burned tires , while @entity65 , or anti-balaka , militiaman moved through the city and sporadic gunfire rattled in the streets			0
a few hours later , on thursday morning , a mosque in @entity17 's @entity84 area was destroyed in apparent retaliation for the church attack			1
the attackers ransacked the interior , removing carpets and breaking down the doors			0
it was one of the last mosques remaining outside the @entity66 neighborhood			0
local @entity94 had been protecting the mosque because it was being used by foreign @entity61 , from @entity96 and elsewhere , but that tolerance came to an abrupt end with the church attack			1
@entity11 troops tried to remove the barricades thursday , but tensions were high around the mosque			0
hundreds also came out in the streets to protest against the international peacekeeping forces -- @entity107 troops and the @entity12 forces -- whom they accuse of doing too little to protect the people			2
the @entity112 described the situation in @entity17 as " fluid and somewhat chaotic			1
" its teams on the ground have received reports of injured people in the demonstrations but are still assessing the number of casualties , it said			0
a town divided people in @entity17 are not alone in suffering the effects of brutal sectarian violence			1
and once again , the peacekeepers sent to protect the people are bearing the brunt of their anger			2
until last week , @entity61 and @entity94 co-existed peacefully @entity131 , a town some 240 miles northeast of the capital			1
but all that changed when fighting broke out between @entity61 youths and @entity107 peacekeepers outside the town			1
the young @entity61 men , afraid that the peacekeepers would disarm the predominantly @entity61 militia based in the town -- leaving them unable to fight off the advancing @entity65 militia -- took up arms			1
some @entity61 militia members then joined them			1
as the first shots and explosions rang out , terrified @entity94 and other @entity148 took refuge in a dusty area between the town 's cathedral and the diocesan headquarters			1
for three days , thousands took shelter from the clashes			0
even as the fighting eased sunday , most remained there , too scared to leave			0
meanwhile , members of the @entity160 stayed in their neighborhoods , leaving the town of some 65,000 effectively segregated			0
the @entity107 peacekeepers have kept a distance outside town			1
the mostly @entity61 militia once known as the @entity166 changed its name this month to @entity169 forces			1
its leaders decided this month to make @entity131 their headquarters to stave off the threat from anti-balaka rivals			1
" we do n't want dialogue with the anti-balaka , " a spokesman for the rebels in @entity131 said			2
" the only thing that exists between us and the anti-balaka is cartridges , " he added , slapping the barrel of his gun to emphasize his point			0
spiral of violence the country began its descent into chaos in march 2013 after a coalition of mostly @entity61 rebels ousted president @entity191			2
the former @entity166 group has since been forced from power , but @entity65 and @entity61 militias have continued to battle for control			2
to counter attacks on @entity65 communities , the vigilante groups known as the anti-balaka , which translates to " anti-machete , " fought back			0
the ethnic violence prompts fears of another genocide like the one in @entity203 20 years ago			0
according to the spokesman for @entity24 @entity205 ban ki - moon , the attack on the @entity56 of @entity29 followed violence this week in which suspected anti-balaka elements killed three @entity61 youths			1
@entity205 urged the transitional government , which took charge this year , to prevent further violence and hold those responsible to account			0
he also called on the peacekeeping forces to do all they can to support those efforts			0
the @entity24 has promised as many as 10,000 military personnel by september 15 , which may help expand peacekeeping operations .			0
