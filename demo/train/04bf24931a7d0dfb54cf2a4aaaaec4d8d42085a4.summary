it was billed as a clash between emerging jumps superstar @entity2 and one of the best staying hurdlers of all time , @entity7 's			1
but in the event , another up - and - comer , more of that , spoiled the party by capturing the @entity12 on the third day of the @entity13			1
victory extended trainer @entity15 's record to three winners this week , while for jockey @entity18 it was yet another winner on a horse that had been rejected by number one jockey a @entity22 -- he scored in the @entity23 on @entity24 on wednesday			2
the perennial @entity25 , who suffered a horror fall here on wednesday , plumped for @entity28 , who could do no better than third			0
11 - 8 favorite @entity2 ran a gallant race to finish second			1
the only mare in the race , @entity2 initially seemed to be overawed by the occasion , unaccustomed to the roar of a 60,000 capacity crowd in her ears			2
but she was soon settled by jockey @entity38 and sat comfortably towards the back of the field			0
as the business end of the race approached , she was maneuvered to within striking distance of @entity44 's , but when it became apparent that the threat was going to come not from @entity47 's mount but from the @entity49 runners , at @entity28 and more of that , she was switched by @entity38 to the outside			1
as the final flight loomed @entity2 and more of that rose together but on the long run to the winning post @entity56 was able to find greater reserves of stamina			0
trainer @entity15 was full of praise for the six - year - old			1
" we were very pleased with the horse and he was in great old form , " @entity15 said			0
" jumping the last , i thought he would keep galloping			0
i had a little doubt in my mind that @entity2 might not quite get home but she gave us a fair fright			0
" @entity44 's had become virtually synonymous with this race , having won four of the last five editions ( he missed 2013 through injury )			1
regarded by many as one of the best staying hurdlers of all time , @entity7 's had failed to make a fairy - tale comeback from injury this season and only managed fifth place today			0
the 11 - year - old was immediately retired after this 40th race and took a victory lap of the parade ring to rapturous applause			1
a visibly moved @entity88 , trainer of @entity7 's , concluded : " you have got to be sensible and draw stumps at the right time and this is the right time			2
