-- the thing about presidential elections , be it in @entity4 or anywhere else for that matter , is that it makes sense to ignore everything that was said during the election campaign and , especially , in the immediate aftermath			1
election promises are made to be broken or ignored altogether -- remember " @entity12 ? " and in the first few days , or even weeks , after results are announced lots of things are said that mean pretty much nothing			1
to say that the presidential election campaign in @entity4 produced a lot of statements and pledges that made little or no sense would be an understatement			1
if you summarise them all , then @entity4 should be in fine shape to join the @entity28 group of industrialised nations , replacing @entity30 , in about five years ' time			2
the election winner , confectionary billionaire @entity33 , and his nearest rival , former prime minister @entity35 - the two have received 57 and 12 per cent of the votes respectively - have promised to unite @entity4 , suppress the rebellion in the east , return @entity40 grabbed by @entity30 , revive the country and put it smack at the heart of @entity43 while practically no - one even bothered to contradict them			1
and even @entity45 -- one of 17 candidates for the presidency , walking around in full @entity49 costume -- did n't really sound over the top compared to others			0
the whole point of the hastily - arranged election in @entity4 was to get a " legitimate " president , of sorts , to emerge in @entity56 , even if he would be the best of the worst , as someone said , and attempt to introduce some sense of normality in @entity4 which has been rocked by violence and upheaval since november last year after the then president @entity63 walked away from a free association deal with the @entity65 , and was later ousted as a result			1
all the talk of a possible second round if no - one won more than 50 per cent of the vote was obviously intended to put a bit of " competitiveness " into elections that were predetermined from the moment one of the favourites , former heavyweight boxer @entity76 , stood down from the race , throwing his impressive weight behind @entity33			2
not to mention the approval of his candidacy by @entity82 ( president @entity84 's cover was blown when he congratulated the winner before the votes had been counted -- he really needs some coaching in the art of diplomacy			0
) announcing his victory late on sunday , @entity33 said all the things that he had been saying during his election campaign : that under his presidency @entity4 would be united , that the economy would grow , that the country was going to join @entity43 , that he was prepared to deal with @entity30 but would never accept the annexation of @entity40 and the two referendums on independence that had been conducted in @entity101 and @entity102 regions in the east on may 11			1
opinion : will @entity4 's new president tame country 's elite ? in fact , the " @entity114 " as he was dubbed during the election campaign , said that the anti-terrorist operation in the east against the @entity112 rebels would be intensified , although hinted that it wo n't be running for months but would be wound up relatively quickly			1
if that was n't a hint to @entity119 that the soon to be crowned new leader was open to suggestion , then i do n't what is			0
the big challenge that @entity33 , a clever political operator who has managed to steer through troubled waters under four presidents , is facing comes from the mere fact of his victory			1
as of now , the buck stops with him and he will be held responsible for anything that happens in the country			1
that was why the cunning @entity35 , when she accepted defeat in the election , pointed out that her former opponent was now in charge and would be taking on the weight of responsibility			0
( @entity35 still fares her chances of becoming president quite highly and , as i was informed , plans to highlight all the problems that @entity33 would no doubt start encountering with gusto			2
) seasoned @entity4 watchers , who have slept through the current revolution in @entity56 and failed to predict the overthrow of president @entity63 in february , have now got a new spring in their step , pointing out that a lot would depend on how the @entity151 will play its cards and whether it would be serious in dealing with @entity33			1
although @entity119 has already signalled , on all levels , that it is prepared to give the new @entity4 leader a chance , and a possible visit to @entity30 in june has already been mentioned			2
but , ironically , the biggest challenge facing @entity33 in the next several months comes not from @entity30 or the so - called separatists in the east but from @entity4 's very own oligarchs , who now see the newly - elected president as a potential threat to their business empires			1
it was one thing when @entity33 was just a candidate , but once that inauguration comes , he will have the power to not only to put financial pressure on the oligarchs but also to order their arrest and put them in prison for the many sins they have committed			1
and the example of @entity35 ending up in the slammer in the times of president @entity63 must be still fresh in their minds			0
make no mistake , the oligarchs with their vast wealth , their personal armies and their people in the government machine , the police and the intelligence services will not stay idle			0
the horse trading and the scratching of backs was going on ever since @entity33 emerged as the favorite for the presidency			0
but that does n't mean he ca n't be pragmatic and go back on his promises			0
and it sure does n't mean that the rest will keep their word as well			0
especially as some of the oligarchs actually prefer a situation of instability and uncertainty , as they thrive under such conditions and find it easier to jostle for power			0
so what can happen in the next year or so ? well , the parliamentary elections will obviously take place this year in @entity4 , with @entity33 promising to " see them through			1
" the talks with @entity30 will commence very soon , if only to resolve the gas supply issue , but wo n't bring any dramatic results on most other subjects in the foreseeable future , with the prospect of @entity40 coming back to the @entity4 fold looking as likely as @entity220 winning the next presidential election in the @entity222 so the only realistic way out could be agreeing some sort of compensation , paid out by @entity30 to @entity4 , say something like $ 500 billion over a period of 10 years or more , in return for @entity56 accepting the loss of the peninsula and the world recognising it as part of @entity30			2
the resolution of the problem with the separatist @entity101 and @entity102 regions promises to be a thorny issue , but if @entity33 and president @entity238 were able to negotiate a ceasefire in the next few weeks or so , this would be seen as a great achievement			2
and although @entity33 is telling everyone that the idea of federalism and giving @entity101 and @entity102 greater autonomy is totally unacceptable to him , things , as has been pointed out above , do tend to change a lot after elections , so he might change his mind on this one as well			0
finally , a lot will depend on whether the @entity222 and the @entity65 would actually allow @entity33 some serious room for manoeuvre to deal with president @entity238			0
if he is boxed in by the demands of his @entity254 patrons to keep the pressure on @entity119 high , then his chances of achieving anything will be quite slim and the other oligarchs might just be tempted to bring him down			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity261 .			0
