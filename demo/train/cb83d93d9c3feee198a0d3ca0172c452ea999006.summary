-- and now the saga of the @entity3 miners -- at least a part of it -- may be about to make a detour to @entity7			1
which may not be as bizarre a notion as it sounds			0
one of the 33 miners who endured more than two months trapped underground , and who was pulled to safety last week , is a devoted fan of the @entity14			1
@entity15 , 34 , speaks little @entity16 , according to his father			2
but there is an exception ; he knows all the words to most of @entity14 's biggest hits			1
it was reported that @entity15 led @entity14 singalongs down below , to lift the miners ' spirits and to help pass the long and lonely hours			1
his dad , waiting for all those weeks near the @entity28 mine in @entity3 , fashioned a placard promising his son that , when he emerged from the ground , he would be " bigger than @entity33			2
" so it is that @entity15 , when he feels up to it , may be embarking on a journey to @entity37 , to set foot in the house where @entity14 lived			1
the people who run @entity14 's @entity7 mansion have invited the miner to @entity14 's home			1
if he goes , he 's likely to love it -- take the word of someone who has been a serial visitor to @entity7 over the years			2
i can tell mr. @entity15 that if he thought he needed sunglasses to protect his eyes from the light near the mine opening after those months in the dimness , he might do well to bring them along to @entity7 with him , too			1
the place is a little garish			0
but it 's pretty great			0
i highly recommend that he spend time standing at the entrance to the @entity59 , the part of @entity7 that best portrays @entity14 's playfulness			1
as the story goes , he purchased all of the room 's eccentric furniture during one 30 - minute shopping spree at a @entity37 store called @entity68 's			2
he outfitted the room with chairs bearing the carved likenesses of animal faces ; he had green shag carpeting nailed to the ceiling ; he ordered a constantly dripping waterfall to be constructed on one wall -- in many ways the @entity59 is the soul of @entity7			2
if @entity15 pays close attention , there are all kinds of memories to take from that house			2
on visits over the years , i 've jotted notations about @entity33 ' record collection ( even @entity33 had to listen to someone other than @entity33 -- he had @entity89 albums , a @entity90 , a copy of the once wildly popular " @entity97 " comedy album , featuring satires of the @entity95 family by impressionist @entity96 ) ; about his gas station credit card ( from the @entity99 , issued to " mr. @entity14 , " his name typed onto stiff white paper in those pre-plastic credit card days ) ; about the only portrait @entity14 ever commissioned of himself ( by artist @entity105 , showing @entity33 dressed all in white , standing in clouds against a gold sky background			1
the framed portrait is an almost exact copy of an old @entity111 album cover			0
@entity33 reportedly saw that album cover , which was also painted by @entity113 , and liked it so much that he ordered the same thing for himself )			0
but , after all those awful days and nights trapped in the mine , the main thing that @entity15 might be justified in taking away from a trip to @entity7 is a sense of the grand possibilities that life can offer , and the unexpected joy that may be waiting around the next corner			1
@entity14 was n't always the man in the mansion ; a poor kid from @entity127 , @entity128 , he had no inkling that he would ever end up in the lavish home in @entity37 ' @entity132 neighborhood			1
if @entity15 should scarcely be able to comprehend that he has made it to @entity7 ... well , that is a feeling that the owner of the house understood very well			1
@entity14 's friend @entity141 ( they went to @entity143 in @entity37 together ) once told me that in the years before @entity33 ' life turned dark and unhappy , the two of them would arrive giddily back at the mansion after a saturday night on the town : " @entity33 and i would be driving through the gates of @entity7 , and he would say , ' @entity139 , @entity140 , do you believe this is real ? do you believe this has happened to me ? ' " it 's a universal feeling , for those who are lucky			1
and right now , @entity15 and his 32 fellow miners have a right to consider themselves among the luckiest people alive			1
see more opinion articles on topics in the news which brings us to a message from another singer , who found himself in @entity37 one night just as his own young career was on the ascendancy			0
there is a story that he told from the stage , letting his audiences know about what had happened that night in the 1970s			0
@entity167 said he had gone to the gates of @entity7 , just to look			0
he had seen a light in a window , and , on an impulse , had climbed over the wall and tried to approach the house			0
a security guard had stopped him			0
the guard had said that @entity14 was out of town , and had escorted @entity167 back to the street			0
this is a transcript of what @entity167 told a concert audience one night : " later on , i used to wonder what i would have said if i 'd knocked on the door and if @entity33 had come to the door , because it really was n't @entity33 i was goin ' to see			2
but , it was like he came along , and whispered some dream in everybody 's ear , and we all dreamed it			0
and maybe that 's why we 're here tonight , i do n't know			0
" i remember later , when a friend of mine called to tell me that he 'd died			0
it was so hard to understand how somebody whose music came in and took away so many people 's loneliness , and gave so many people a reason and a sense of the possibilities of living , could have , in the end , died so tragically			1
" and i guess when you 're alone , you ai n't nothin ' but alone			0
" yet just when a person feels most alone , comfort can somehow come to him			0
@entity15 , who speaks little @entity16 , is said to have found sustenance in that @entity3 mine , for him and for his colleagues , through the music of a man from @entity37 he had never met			2
and if @entity15 does make it to @entity7 , i hope there will be echoes , not just for him but for all 33 , of something else that @entity167 said on that long - ago stage			1
he was about to sing his own slowed - down rendition of @entity14 's " @entity228			1
" he said to the audience : " so , anyway , i 'd like to do this song for you tonight , wishing you all the longest life , with the best of absolutely everything			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity237 .			0

@entity15 kept his fellow trapped miners going with @entity33 singalongs
he 's been invited to visit @entity14 's @entity7 mansion
@entity237 says he wo n't be *disappointed* if he visits the *over-the* - top house
he says @entity14 , who fought loneliness , left us music that helps people cope
