@entity0 , @entity1 -- the building , no. 50 , that members of the @entity6 family call home sits on a seemingly quiet street in @entity0			1
the capital of @entity9 , a semi-autonomous republic in southern @entity1 , borders the @entity10 on one side and on the other overlooks the @entity13			1
for a time in 2012 , @entity6 stayed here with his parents			1
he shopped at stores in @entity0 , prayed at a local mosque			0
what authorities want to know is whether it was here that @entity6 learned , or perhaps was inspired , to kill			2
the 26 - year - old ca n't give an answer : he was killed after a shootout with @entity25 authorities in @entity26 , @entity27 -- 5,500 miles from @entity0 -- early friday			2
days earlier , authorities say , he and his 19 - year - old brother , @entity28 -- who is in a @entity30 hospital -- blew up two bombs at the finish line of the @entity33			2
three people died and scores were wounded in that attack			0
@entity38 agents spent wednesday in the @entity40 capital talking with @entity6 and @entity28 's parents , according to an official in @entity25 president @entity44 's administration			1
the @entity25 investigators were joined by members of @entity1 's @entity48 , human rights activist @entity45 said			1
that " conversation " ended wednesday evening , the suspects ' mother , @entity49 , told @entity45			0
it 's unclear what came of the parents ' talk with @entity25 and @entity1 authorities , though both parents had publicly insisted that their sons are innocent			1
but information has come out suggesting how @entity6 might have been influenced by his trip half a world from his @entity62 , @entity27 , home			0
while @entity9 may be picturesque in many respects , it 's also been home to violence and civil unrest			2
that includes gun and bomb attacks targeting security services , including a suicide bombing at a police checkpoint that left 12 dead and dozens wounded while @entity6 was believed to be here			0
after returning from his months - long visit to @entity1 , @entity6 created a @entity77 channel that included two videos ( since deleted ) under a category labeled " terrorists			1
" analysis by @entity2 and the @entity82 has uncovered a screen grab from one of those videos featuring members of @entity87 , a potent militant @entity89 group in the @entity90 , which includes @entity91 and @entity9			0
@entity6 also appears to have posted and removed a video of a militant named @entity94 , a jihadist leader who was later killed by @entity1 troops			1
did @entity6 interact with @entity94 during his time in southern @entity1 ? authorities have n't publicly said anything on that point , either way			1
videos linked to his group show how to prepare homemade explosives from almost anywhere			2
@entity105 , the police chief in the @entity40 town of @entity107 , said @entity94 met with foreigners before his death			0
this group included men , like @entity6 , who were of @entity113 origin			0
