@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 was grateful when @entity4 bypassed his home in @entity6 , @entity1			1
but when he saw the devastation in other areas of the country , he wanted to do all he could to help his fellow @entity1			1
" i was crying watching the news , " said @entity3 , the 2009 @entity10			1
" it really sank my heart , seeing all the people who lost their loved ones , houses			2
" @entity18 immediately began collecting donations at his mobile " pushcart classrooms , " which he uses to educate poor children in the country			2
but he wanted to do more			0
so he reached halfway around the world to @entity26 , a @entity28 clean - water activist who had also been honored as a top 10 @entity10 in 2009			1
after a disaster strikes , access to clean water is vital to help prevent the spread of disease			2
@entity26 , who has responded to humanitarian crises in @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 , had just started assessing how his nonprofit , wine to @entity40 , might help the @entity1 when he received @entity42 's e-mail			1
" i was already thinking that maybe i should go , " @entity26 said			1
" when he shot me the e-mail ... he sealed the deal			0
" our organization depends on relationships with people on the ground ... ( and ) what better relationship than with @entity3 ? " soon , @entity26 was on a flight to the @entity1 with hundreds of water filters in tow			1
@entity18 picked him up at the airport in @entity57			0
" that was a long trip from the @entity59 to the @entity1 ... and he has put out his own money and resources to help us , " @entity3 said			1
" we were both excited , seeing each other			0
" the next day , both men helped volunteers assemble the filters and pack 120,000 meals donated by @entity68 , one of @entity26 's partner organizations			1
then they headed to @entity0 , in the heart of the devastated area , to deliver the filters			1
@entity26 said it 's hard to communicate the scope of the disaster			1
" it reminds me of @entity36 because the buildings are completely collapsed , destroyed ... but it 's different , " he said			0
" the trees on mountains are blown over , lying down like matchsticks , and palm trees have snapped in half , broken			0
" @entity18 said that the destruction was worse than he 'd seen on television , but he soon found reason to take heart			0
" when we got to the communities , they were asking for help , " he said			0
" when @entity26 presented them with filters , i saw hope in their eyes			1
" @entity26 said they will have distributed 2,000 filters by the end of the week			1
because each filter can provide enough clean water for 10 people , and because each will last for 10 years , @entity26 estimates that at least 20,000 people will benefit			1
he originally planned to return home for the @entity110 holiday , but he now intends to stay until early december			0
" i could n't be home for a nice @entity110 dinner and pretend like nothing happened , " he said			0
" there 's too much we have to do			0
" @entity18 returned home wednesday to focus on a new project : bringing his pushcart classrooms to the devastated areas to help educate children while the communities rebuild			2
the country 's minister of education has expressed strong interest in the large - scale replication of the program , @entity18 said , and asked him to assess the feasibility during his visit			0
@entity18 hopes work can begin in the coming weeks			0
other @entity10 are also responding to help those affected by the typhoon			1
@entity130 , the @entity59 - born midwife named @entity10 in 2011 , has strong ties to the @entity1 ; her mother was @entity1			1
so after the storm , she brought food and medical supplies			2
she has also been working with local clinics to provide assistance to pregnant women , new mothers and young children			2
unexpectedly , @entity26 and @entity18 ran into @entity141 as they traveled from @entity57 , an impromptu @entity142 of sorts			2
@entity26 now plans to provide water filters to @entity141 so she can distribute them to the women and children she is helping			1
dr. @entity148 , a 2013 @entity149 , has also provided @entity141 with one of five " solar suitcases " that she has donated to the relief effort			2
these portable kits provide essential power to medical clinics			0
@entity156 , a group of military veterans that responds to natural disasters , was on the ground within days of the storm			0
the group , founded by 2012 @entity10 @entity162 , has 43 volunteers in the @entity1 providing medical care , opening supply lines and helping repair a field hospital in an area west of @entity0			1
@entity169 , a @entity170 in 2010 , is also hoping to partner with @entity18			0
although @entity169 normally distributes his solar - powered lanterns to rural communities in @entity174 , he has launched an online campaign to raise funds so he can assist @entity1 more than 5,000 miles away			2
this outpouring of help has greatly touched @entity42			0
" @entity10 are like family , and i 'm glad that my fellow heroes have immediately responded , " he said			2
" but that 's what you do when you are family : you help each other			0
... that makes me feel happy and so grateful			0
" you can support relief efforts in the @entity1 through @entity42 's @entity187 or @entity26 's @entity188 or by visiting @entity2 's @entity189			1
@entity2 's @entity190 contributed to this report .			0
