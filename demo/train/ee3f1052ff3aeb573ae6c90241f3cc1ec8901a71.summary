@entity0 -- you can blame it on out - of - towners			0
in january , passengers of @entity5 had to be rescued out of the @entity6 after a bird strike			1
@entity9 scientists say it was migratory @entity12 geese -- and not resident @entity12 geese -- that caused @entity5 to ditch in @entity14 's @entity6 on january 15			1
more specifically , it was at least two female and one male geese flying at approximately 2,900 feet that got sucked into the two engines of the @entity19 , disabling both engines and causing one of the more spectacular water landings in aviation history			0
all 155 people safely evacuated the jet			0
officials knew almost from the start that @entity12 geese were responsible for the incident , both because of capt. @entity31 's radio report and because few other types of birds flock at that altitude in the mid-atlantic			1
but on monday , the eve of a three - day @entity38 hearing into the crash , the @entity9 announced that sophisticated scientific techniques allowed them to conclude that the @entity5 birds were @entity12 geese from @entity43 , @entity12 , and were significantly different from geese in @entity14			1
museum scientists said molecular study of feathers found in the engines leads them to believe the birds had probably nested in @entity43 in the summer of 2008 and migrated to the @entity14 region for the winter			1
on the day of the crash , @entity9 wildlife biologist @entity53 said , the ground was covered with snow , and the flock was probably on a short flight south looking for clear ground or water on which to forage for food			0
@entity12 geese ( @entity62 ) are " essentially flying cows , " @entity53 said , given their unrelenting quest for food			1
the migratory birds are among the largest species of bird in @entity68 , with an estimated weight of about 8 pounds each			1
the determination that the birds were the 8 - pound variety and not the 4 - pound @entity74 geese is likely to comfort jet engine designers , since the engines are designed to survive strikes from 4 - pound birds			1
but the finding also is likely to raise questions about whether engine requirements should be more robust to survive strikes from 8 - pound birds			1
bird strikes remain one of the most intractable problems facing aviation			0
there were more than 7,400 bird strikes in the @entity89 in 2007 , including 110 that caused substantial damage to aircraft			0
but the @entity93 estimates that only 20 percent of strikes are reported			0
airports attempt to manage local populations of birds by harassing them , typically by creating loud noises that scare the birds away , or by killing birds			0
but migratory birds require other approaches , such as monitoring their movements and improved radar			0
@entity9 scientists say it is important to study bird migration patterns to prevent future collisions			2
@entity110 of the @entity9 's @entity111 says the @entity9 has been conducting bird strike identifications for the @entity93 and the military for more than 50 years			1
shortly after the @entity5 incident , the museum got its first feather from a @entity89 @entity118 biologist working with the @entity38			0
in all , the museum got several batches of remains , some from an engine that remained under water three days , and the rest from an engine on the @entity6 bottom for nine days			0
at the @entity9 's @entity130 labs in @entity131 , @entity132 , scientists examined isotopes in the feathers			2
the stable - hydrogen isotope values in feathers can serve as geographic markers since they reflect the types of vegetation in the bird 's diet at the time it grew new feathers , @entity53 said			2
the feather samples were compared to a reference library of 620,000 specimen at the @entity147 in @entity148 , @entity149 , the @entity9 said			1
the finding , published today in " @entity151 , " concluded the geese were from the @entity43 area			1
" although these geese were [ migratory ] , we do not believe that these individuals were actually migrating north to return to breeding areas			0
instead , we hypothesize that these birds were undertaking a short - distance movement on their wintering grounds in response to freezing temperatures and snow cover , in an effort to find open water and food , a behavior commonly found in species of birds wintering at temperate latitudes , " the report says			2
at the time of the @entity176 bird strike , the flock was in the upper limits of their flying abilities , the @entity9 said			1
about " 3,000 feet is pretty much their limit , " @entity110 said			0
the highest known bird strike came when a jet in @entity184 hit a vulture at 37,000 feet , she said			2
@entity53 and @entity110 said " billions " of birds threaten aviation			0
consequently , more research needs to be done on radar capable of detecting birds , more information is needed on migratory patterns and scientists need to integrate weather patterns into models that can predict bird movements , they said .			2

feather samples lead @entity9 to migratory @entity12 geese
birds probably nested in @entity12 's @entity43 area and migrated to @entity14
@entity9 has been conducting bird strike ids for @entity93 , military for decades
species weighs about 8 pounds , while plane engines built to handle 4 - pound birds
