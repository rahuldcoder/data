these are n't features typically associated with hotels , but the most interesting places to stay in @entity8 somehow make them work			1
this group of hotels goes a few steps further than turndown service and a free breakfast lineup to make your stay memorable			1
@entity16 ( @entity17 , @entity18 ) modeled after the funky @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21 , the @entity16 has transformed 20 concrete sewer pipes into minimalistic hotel rooms			1
artfully arranged in groups of three , the pipes are 8 feet wide and 11 feet long and outfitted with a queen - sized bed , desk light and fan			0
claustrophobic or amenities - driven travelers need not apply			0
@entity31 , @entity32 17 @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity18 ; +52 739 395 3613 ; from $ 31 per night @entity36 ( @entity37 , @entity38 ) in the dense forest along the western coast of @entity38 lies the body of an old @entity42			1
it 's not the ominous remains of a flight gone wrong , but rather a luxury hotel suite			2
dangling over the side of a hill amid a selection of more traditional accommodations , the fuselage of the vintage 1965 jetliner has been remade into a two - bedroom rental complete with dining area , sitting room and a small wooden deck for spotting the toucans , howler monkeys and other jungle creatures			0
the fuselage that encases the two bedrooms of the " @entity63 " suite is intact			0
apart from the distinctive shape of the portholes and curved ceiling , however , the interior feels more woodsy bungalow than aircraft			0
@entity36 , about a half mile from entrance to @entity71 , @entity37 , @entity38 ; +506 2777 0584 ; 727 suite from $ 250 per night @entity73 ( @entity74 , @entity18 ) " @entity80 " sounds like an oxymoron , but not when you 're talking about the 20 designer shelters that make up this @entity79 retreat			1
each sparse but chic unit includes king - size beds , ceiling fans and floor - to - ceiling windows			1
the hotel is positioned among craggy terrain , so it blends in with the landscape of this fertile wine - growing region just 90 minutes south of @entity89			0
@entity92 - @entity91 , kilometer 75 , @entity74 , @entity18 ; +52 646 155 2775 ; from $ 175 per night @entity94 's @entity93 , @entity95 , @entity38 with six stories , four bedrooms , and two bathrooms , @entity96 just might be the world 's coolest tree house			1
built 60 feet up around a towering guanacaste tree in the rainforest of remote southern @entity38 , this arboreal perch offers guests unexpected luxuries like warm showers and air - conditioning , not to mention a bird 's - eye view of the native wildlife			1
@entity94 's @entity93 , 13 kilometers north of @entity111 , @entity95 , @entity38 ; +508 714 0622 ; from $ 1,850 per week @entity112 ( @entity113 , @entity114 ) other than its name , what makes this hotel unique is its shape			1
the work of @entity122 , one of @entity114 's most talented architects , it 's been said to resemble everything from a boat to a slice of watermelon , but the construction was simply an ingenious way to get around the city 's building - height codes			2
inside , it 's not all that different from any other upscale property , except perhaps for the rooms ' circular windows and an odd transparent , retractable wall between the bed and the bathroom			1
@entity112 , @entity139 , 4700 , @entity140 , @entity113 , @entity114 ; +55 11 3055 4700 ; from $ 370 per night @entity141 ( @entity142 , @entity143 ) this 12 - room lodge rising above the treetops of @entity146 has an unusual origin			2
it was built by the @entity149 in 1965 as a radar tower to help in the defense of the @entity152 , and was later used for everything from controlling air traffic to aiding in the war on drugs			2
today , it 's a hotel and nature observatory			2
the rooftop deck offers a 360 - degree view of the forest below			0
it 's popular with birders hoping to catch a glimpse of the bicolored antbird , blue cotinga and other species that reside in the forest canopy			2
@entity170 , 35 miles north of @entity171 , @entity142 , @entity143 ; +507 264 5720 ; from $ 120 per night ( three - night minimum ) @entity172 ( @entity173 , @entity174 ) you may be tempted to lick the walls at this oddball hotel , but please refrain			1
especially if you have high blood pressure			0
that 's because the entire thing is made of salt			1
billions of tons of it , in fact , all of which came from the nearby @entity188 salt flat ( the world 's largest )			1
the unusual building material was used to construct the floors , ceilings and almost everything in between , including the beds and the property 's nine - hole golf course			1
@entity172 , @entity188 , @entity197 , @entity173 , @entity174 ; +591 68420888 ; from $ 135 per night @entity198 ( @entity199 , @entity200 ) it 's a trek getting to this 13 - room retreat in the middle of the @entity204 , but make it and you 'll be treated to a vine - covered , volcano - shaped lodge with daily eruptions that spew water down the side of the property			1
step indoors and the woodsy theme will have you feeling like you 're inside a hallowed - out tree			2
given the look and feel of the place , you might think you 'd be surrounded by hobbits , but your neighbors are actually the pumas , pygmy owls and other creatures that make their home in the forest			0
@entity225 , inside @entity204 , 530 miles south of @entity226 , @entity199 , @entity200 ; +56 2 233 559 38 ; from $ 200 per night @entity227 ( @entity228 , @entity18 ) one look at this luxury hotel and it 's not hard to imagine its previous incarnation as the @entity234 , a bullfighting arena dating to the nineteenth century			0
forty - nine suites now reside where the grandstand once stood and the ring where the matadors once battled beasts is now a charming courtyard			0
all of it has been remade to appease hotel guests while preserving the structure 's classic colonial style			0
@entity227 , @entity247 434 , col. @entity248 , @entity250 , @entity18 ; +492 922 9104 ; from $ 126 per night @entity251 ( @entity252 , @entity200 ) @entity253 meets sustainability at this cluster of igloo - shaped suites that house visitors exploring the rugged @entity259 plains with adventure outfitter @entity260			0
the domes are designed to mimic the dwellings of the nomadic @entity265 tribe that once inhabited the area green features include low - emission woodstoves and state - of - the - art composting toilets			0
there 's also enough electricity to charge your camera , so you can snap plenty of pics of the incredible @entity252 landscape			0
@entity278 , @entity279 , approximately 200 miles north of @entity281 airport , @entity252 , @entity200 ; +56 2 2923 5950 ; call for rates			0
