@entity0 -- in a career already groaning under the weight of titles and accolades , @entity2 joined another exclusive list of tennis luminaries when he beat @entity9 in this year 's @entity11 final			1
in notching up his seventh @entity11 win a month before his 31st birthday , @entity2 became the oldest champion since @entity14 in 1975 , and only the 11th player in the @entity17 era to win a grand slam in his 30s			1
only @entity20 ( at the @entity17 in 2001 and 2003 ) and @entity21 ( @entity22 2002 ) have achieved the feat this century suggesting that , more than ever , modern tennis is a game which favors the power , agility and the sheer exuberance of youth			1
despite the ambition of those young guns and not forgetting the distractions of a young family , @entity2 's desire to remain competitive appears undimmed			1
after dispatching the then 23 - year - old @entity35 in the final of the @entity38 event in @entity39 last february , @entity2 said he hoped to be around for another " three , five , six years			2
" and following his silver medal at the @entity42 tennis tournament in august he reiterated that wish			0
" i 'll be 35 in @entity44			0
i think it 's possible , but we 'll see how it goes , " @entity2 told @entity1			2
the @entity49 champion is n't the only one enjoying a resurgence in the autumn of his career			1
from his perch at the summit of the world rankings -- which he reclaimed after winning @entity11 -- @entity2 surveys a top 100 in which almost a quarter ( 24 ) of players are over the age of 30			1
five places below the @entity49 is @entity61 's @entity60 ( who turned 30 in february ) while lower down lie @entity62 from @entity64 and @entity66 's @entity65			1
the 31 - year - olds , ranked 35 and 37 respectively , have both won tournaments this year -- the @entity70 winning the @entity71 in @entity72 in january while @entity65 took the @entity74 title the following month			0
@entity76 's @entity75 , who turned 34 in april , is currently the oldest player in the top 25			2
the former world no.2 , whose career has been plagued by injuries , started this season outside the top 200 , but has shot up the rankings this year to a current high of 21 in the rankings			2
the rise was helped , in part , by victory over @entity2 in the final of the @entity38 tournament on home soil in @entity91 last june			0
" maybe 30 is the new 20 , " the @entity76 told @entity1 's @entity92 , not entirely in jest			0
" you know , i think a lot of the guys are becoming so much more professional ... everybody is looking more at how physical the game has gotten and how important it is to stay healthy and fit , " @entity75 said			0
" thirty , at the end of the day , is really just a number ... if you really love something and you want to do it the right way , why not do it until you really know you ca n't do it anymore			0
" it 's a philosophy which @entity2 shares , @entity75 thinks			2
" he 's a world - class athlete			0
he knows exactly what he is doing			0
he prepares as well as anyone out there ... he does n't second guess many things , so i 'm not really surprised			0
" @entity114 , the feted long - time fitness coach ( and friend ) to @entity20 , says @entity2 is just a class apart			1
" @entity2 is a perfect athlete -- his movement , his game , his mental , his physical			2
there 's @entity2 and then there 's everyone else , " @entity114 said			1
technological advances and the physically demanding nature of the modern game have caught up with players less gifted and younger than @entity2 , says @entity114 , leading to lots of wear and tear			1
with players hitting that ball harder than ever , there is simply less time to play the next shot , he says			0
" you 're going to be out of position unless you redirect your body very forcefully and very violently , and that 's just taking its toll on our knees and our hips			2
so you have to counter that and prepare your body for the game , " @entity114 said			1
watch : @entity145 tours his hometown preparing his body for the game enabled @entity20 to play with " great relevance " right up to age of 36 , says @entity114			1
the @entity151 's latter playing years were the most fruitful of his career with five of his eight grand slams won after his 29th birthday			0
he was also world no.1 at the age of 33			0
" when you stop and think about it , that 's amazing , " @entity114 says			2
strength was the key to @entity20 's enduring success , @entity114 believes , who recalls " a rather slender fellow " when they first met in 1989			1
but together they devised a fitness program tailored to the stresses and movements @entity20 experienced on court			2
" if we were doing certain running drills , he would say : ' i do n't feel that on my legs the way i do on the tennis court			0
' that was beautiful because then he would leave it to me to come up with the training , " @entity114 said			0
@entity114 would also tailor gym work depending on the playing surface -- the high bounce at @entity185 requiring different strength training to the skiddy low bounce of the @entity189 's grass courts			1
" i can say , honestly , that he was , if not the strongest player on the tour , one of the strongest			0
playing to 36 in this day 's game it takes a lot			1
" @entity114 thinks the next generation of tennis stars will reap the benefits of improving sports science but does not envisage too many current players emulating @entity20 , with one notable exception , perhaps			1
at the start of the year , a back injury forced @entity2 out of the @entity203 in @entity204			0
it was only his second withdrawal during a tournament in his career and prompted speculation that 2012 might be a year of diminishing returns for the great champion			0
ten months on , @entity2 has a further six titles under his belt , and heads towards november 's season - ending @entity213 with just his own records as the oldest winner and six - time champion to beat .			1

@entity2 continues to be a major force in the men 's game despite his advancing years
the @entity49 champion heads a rankings list with 24 players over 30 in the top 100
@entity20 's fitness coach @entity114 says modern game takes great toll on body
strength was a key factor in @entity20 's *longevity* allowing him to play with " great relevance " up until age of 36
