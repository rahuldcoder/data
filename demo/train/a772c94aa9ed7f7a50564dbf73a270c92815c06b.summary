-- @entity2 's parole board tuesday refused to release onetime @entity4 family acolyte @entity3 , finding the 60 - year - old remains dangerous more than four decades after the group 's @entity2 murder spree			1
the board found that @entity3 " still poses a risk to society , " spokesman @entity8 said			1
the decision marks the 19th time that she has been denied parole , and she wo n't be eligible again until 2013 , @entity8 said			2
@entity17 deputy district attorney @entity16 praised the decision			0
" the crime itself was absolutely horrendous -- the brutal slaughter of two individuals in their home , in a cruel and very horrifying manner , " said @entity16			0
" it is our position that she never really has fully accepted responsibility for her crimes			0
" known as " @entity30 " while one of notorious spree killer @entity4 's followers , @entity3 helped hold down @entity33 while other @entity4 family members stabbed her and her husband , @entity33 in 1969			1
she was 19 at the time			0
she has been imprisoned at the @entity35 for more than three decades , following her final conviction on first - degree murder charges in 1978 and a sentence of life in prison			1
prison spokesman lt. @entity41 told @entity0 in 2009 that @entity3 is a model inmate involved in prison programs and a mentor to other inmates in the facility 's college program			2
and lawyer @entity47 , who has been representing @entity3 for just under a year , said tuesday before the hearing that the " fact that @entity3 has had good reports since 1978 " should help persuade the parole board to release her			1
@entity3 , @entity4 , @entity52 and @entity53 were found guilty of murder and conspiracy to commit murder and sentenced to death in 1971			1
their sentences were commuted to life in prison after the @entity62 @entity61 struck down death penalty laws in 1972 and established a four - year moratorium on executions			1
@entity3 's original conviction was overturned in 1976 on grounds that a judge erred in not granting a mistrial after her attorney , @entity70 , disappeared and later was found dead			2
the jury deadlocked in her first retrial , and she was released on bond for a few months			0
but in her third trial , in 1978 , she was convicted of first - degree murder			1
ahead of tuesday 's parole board hearing , @entity47 said she was " excited " about the appearance			2
she planned to bolster her argument with rulings in two cases from the @entity2 @entity61 since @entity3 's last parole hearing , in 2007			2
each case was recently upheld by federal courts			0
@entity47 said during tuesday 's hearing , she planned to cite the case of @entity87 , a convicted murderer who was released in 2007 after more than 20 years in prison			2
the @entity2 @entity61 decided that if an eligible parolee has spent enough time on rehabilitation and reform , the panel has the burden of proving that the inmate poses a current threat to public safety and should not base its decision on what happened decades earlier			0
in addition , @entity47 planned to use the case of @entity102 , who was sentenced to 15 years to life following his 1987 conviction for second - degree murder -- and remains behind bars			1
@entity47 says in that case , the court found that parole boards should give significant consideration to psychologists ' reports regarding whether inmates have demonstrated acceptance of responsibility , insight and understanding of their crimes , as @entity3 has			2
@entity3 told @entity0 's " @entity121 " in 2002 that she herself stabbed @entity33 16 times			1
" the autopsy reports have shown that it was @entity124 ] that wielded the fatal wounds , but i contributed , and i attempted to hold her down for @entity52 , " she said			0
" i called to @entity124 because we could n't kill her			0
you know , it 's -- morally , i feel as though i did			0
" and during a 1994 @entity0 appearance , @entity3 told @entity133 the @entity4 's lifestyle attracted her			1
" i met these people			0
they said that they came from a commune in @entity17 where they lived for the day and for the moment , and it was a lot of the [ @entity143 ] @entity142 kind of philosophy of ' be here now			0
' " @entity3 called @entity4 " an opportunist of the cruelest , most vicious kind , " but she was quick to emphasize that she accepts blame for her role in the crimes			1
@entity0 's @entity151 and @entity152 contributed to this report .			0
