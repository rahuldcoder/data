" we know that @entity2 is working hard to address the issues it has faced in recent months , as well as to reach out to the international community , " said @entity24 from the @entity1			1
" we , together with the @entity1 players , look forward to returning and building on that first , very successful , event in the future			2

@entity46 's @entity45 driver @entity44 raised ethical concerns about hosting a major sporting event in the @entity49			0
" in my personal opinion , the sport should have taken a much firmer stance earlier this year rather than constantly delaying its decision in the hope of being able to reschedule it in 2011 , " @entity44 wrote on his personal web site in june			0
