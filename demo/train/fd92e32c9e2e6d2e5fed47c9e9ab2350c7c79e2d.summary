editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			1
@entity9 is @entity5 's site devoted to the overlap between culture and technology			0
the reports , which are being produced solely by @entity5 , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- tucked between a bodega and a bar in a former industrial neighborhood on the border of @entity7 and @entity27 , an unassuming door leads to @entity8 's newest , most radical punk scene			1
but the slouched - over kids and bearded scenesters who slide into the cavernous space , known as @entity33 , are n't just here for the fine underground music			1
they really come for the video games			1
this is the home of @entity38 , an underground collective and gallery dedicated to pressing the reset button on the concept of the video game arcade , with loving help from a growing culture of independent developers , players and fans			1
do n't expect any change machines , prizes , or incessant video game musak wafting across a linoleum - lined room full of pale adolescents			1
descend into the basement of @entity33 on any given night , and you 're likely to encounter a rowdy scene that looks more like @entity57 if it had been founded by hackers with a predilection for florescent neon			2
that 's how you might describe @entity63 and @entity64 , who met each other through the independent gaming scene after college and launched @entity38 with a smattering of music and beer - soaked events in 2009			0
they grew up in the 1980s and ' 90s , as a steady stream of home gaming consoles were eclipsing the arcade and the privacy of the living room was replacing a lively -- if not completely functional -- public space			1
" it was a dark , dingy place with a lot of teenagers who were really into arcade games , " @entity64 says of his favorite arcade from childhood , the recently - closed @entity80			1
" there were a lot of random strangers and friends you made that night			0
people stood around these machines discussing the games , talking about the games , deconstructing these games			0
" in @entity38 ' cozy underground space , visitors gather around homemade games , installed on often aging computers that are embedded inside ramshackle cabinets			1
the games -- often constructed around an array of silly , bizarre and downright fascinating conceits and told in a vibrant , minimalist aesthetic , are designed by young developers from @entity8 and around the world whose clever antics are more accustomed to internet message boards , blogs and @entity110 channels			1
the cabinets are lovingly decorated in all manner of artwork , from intricate painted cardboard panels to collage - covered wood panels			0
see the rest of @entity38 : @entity116 at @entity9 for the opening exhibition at a temporary space near @entity120 last year , @entity117 , the inimitable maestro of the @entity118 show " @entity122 , " turned a former storefront into a veritable zoo of brightly - colored furniture and cabinets			0
in painted wood and styrofoam , it was a masterful and whimsical refusal to answer that pesky question of whether games can be art. here was a kind of proof that you do n't have to choose			1
nor do you have to play by the rules -- in fact , often no one knows what they are			0
in @entity145 , a staple of the gallery , players are left guessing at the objective : will they be asked to beat their opponents to a single magic button , to force their opponents to press the button , or to carry out instructions printed on the screen in @entity153 ? in the current exhibition , hosted at a separate music venue in @entity156 , a game by @entity158 lets players reenact a popular @entity161 video showing a zealous atv - rider with a giant @entity164 flag who celebrates the death of @entity167 by firing his shotgun aimlessly			2
a game by @entity170 simply asks users to press any key -- they win when they find the correct one			0
doing things the wrong way -- an ethos obvious in the eccentric , sometimes iconoclastic design of many of the gallery 's games -- echoes the progenitors of other devil - may - care and do - it - yourself artistic movements			0
that 's why the music and games at @entity38 events play together so nicely			0
indie rock and punk fare is n't the only soundtrack at @entity191 -- the collective also pairs up with a steady global roster of chiptune musicians , who , with their hacked @entity197 controllers and @entity199 consoles , are in many ways the musical breatheren of today 's lo - fi game developers			1
( @entity38 launched as a party alongside the @entity204 , a showcase of chiptune musicians ; this year 's festival begins this week in @entity8			2
) meanwhile , the patrons of both of these independent communities are in one way or another striving to experience something new -- something that ca n't be bought in a store , but that is available for anyone to see and hear if they look in the right places			1
just like indie music , the independent gaming scene is trading in neat , mass - produced convenience for a rough - hewn , playful provocation			2
" [ at big gaming studios ] games have become massive undertakings in which each developer acts like a cog			0
the budget for games has increased by billions of dollars , and developers do n't take as much risk anymore , " says @entity64			2
" so you see a lot of rehashed games from the same video game engine , like another " @entity235 " clone			1
" the independent gaming movement " is in response to that			0
" the implications of @entity191 remixing go wider than the music , art and gaming worlds			0
the hope , says @entity64 , is to build a kind of economy for independent gaming developers outside the large studios , something akin to what supports indie musicians who make much of their money through touring and merchandise			2
@entity38 ' other mission is to bring an obscured world of hobbyist game development to a larger audience -- a public that may be jaded with a culture often built on testosterone - fueled first - person shooters , or that tends to roll its eyes at the premise of games altogether			2
it 's a formidable challenge , but , as the gallery 's raucous and diverse gatherings prove , one that is n't so hard to beat			2
still , mixing games with the underground music scene can have its downside too -- some musicians who come to play fall in love with the games in the basement , @entity64 says			1
" so bands started missing their sets			0
