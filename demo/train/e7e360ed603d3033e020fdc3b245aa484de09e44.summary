-- when @entity1 picked @entity2 as his running mate , the media frenzy surrounding the announcement included claims that the choice was bad for women and that it would not attract women voters			1
@entity2 's pro-life voting record was especially highlighted , and once again , the " war on women " came to the forefront and diverted attention from the ultimate women 's issue in this election -- our dire economic future			1
it is misguided to think that women vote as a bloc			1
we are a diverse group , and it is nearly impossible for any candidate to appeal to all sides of the political spectrum			0
the reality is that women 's top concerns are the same as men 's , and like men , women are more likely to vote along party lines			1
@entity37 rep. @entity2 's addition to the @entity39 ticket ensures that the debate about the economy will be vigorous			1
for women , and all @entity37 , nothing can be more important			1
@entity45 remark puts abortion at center of campaign debate women i know and talk to around the country are struggling with a new normal -- unemployment or underemployment , declining wages , having to work harder and longer to make ends meet , increasing food prices , rising gas prices and most of all the fear that their kids will have it even tougher than they do			0
they are making difficult decisions every day when it comes to their family budget			0
it is not a rosy picture			0
why would @entity2 appeal to women ? a peek at his early life is illuminating			1
@entity2 , who grew up the son of a lawyer , lost his father at 16 and was then raised by a single mother			2
he helped to care for a grandmother afflicted with @entity75 's disease who lived with the family , worked after school at @entity79 to earn extra money and used some of his father 's @entity83 death benefits to help pay his way through school			0
i appreciate @entity2 's personal experiences			1
having lost my own mother to cancer at 3 , i grew up with my father working two jobs and lived with my grandparents , who took care of us			0
i also used @entity83 death benefits to help put myself through school and became the first in my family of immigrants to go to college			0
the @entity2 family , like many families in @entity37 today , was not immune to experiencing a period of uncertainty			1
@entity2 says this formative period in his life shaped his attitude about self - reliance -- it never occurred to him that his life would not get better			2
at an event in @entity112 , @entity113 , on friday he reminded the audience that aspirations are at the heart of the @entity117			0
over the past week , we have learned a lot more about @entity2 's own path and his career in @entity122 as a budget wonk , rising to become the youngest chairman of the @entity125			1
there are many voices in @entity122 , but few have the depth and knowledge about the $ 16 trillion national debt and its crippling effect on the country and the aspirations of future generations			0
i find it reassuring that @entity1 made the choice to select @entity2			2
@entity2 has distinguished himself by having the courage to offer big ideas and he is forcing a serious discussion about how to reform entitlements			1
he deserves credit for talking tough and leveling with the @entity37 people about what 's involved in changing the course of our current predicament			2
opinion : rape can make you pregnant			0
we all know president @entity152 walked into a very dire economic situation when he came to office , but over the past few years , his policy of growing the government has not put the nation back to work			0
the poverty rate of women , for example , has climbed to its highest level in nearly two decades and doubts about providing for their families have not been alleviated			0
@entity37 women have to ask themselves if they want a federal government that respects their hard - earned dollars as much as it respects their right to choose			2
when they do , i am confident they will not be distracted by media hype and attack ads painting @entity2 as hostile to women 's concerns ; rather , they will find his efforts to stop the buck from being passed to another generation very appealing			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity180 .			2

some think the choice of @entity2 as vice presidential nominee would turn off women
@entity180 : it is misguided to think that women vote as a bloc
she says @entity2 has distinguished himself by having the courage to offer big ideas
@entity180 : women would welcome @entity2 's efforts in *tackling* pressing issues facing @entity37
