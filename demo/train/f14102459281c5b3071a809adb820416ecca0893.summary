-- let 's be honest : was there any way @entity7 " @entity4 was n't going to win " @entity5 " this season ? during tuesday night 's finale , the " @entity9 " star was crowned the king of the dance floor as he and his pro partner , @entity13 , were awarded the mirrorball trophy			1
the actor -- and now dancer -- was so thrilled , he was moved to tears			2
" i can not believe this , " @entity18 told co-host @entity19			0
" i 've wanted it forever			0
... i do n't even know what to say			1
" @entity4 has been a strong competitor and an audience favorite throughout season 19 , even treating us to " @entity27 " more than once			1
yet he almost did n't get the opportunity to see it all the way through			1
the star injured himself during the course of the season to the point that he was n't sure whether he 'd be able to continue			1
but by the start of the two - part finale on monday , @entity4 rallied and turned in a tap dance solo that left viewers speechless			0
despite his injuries , @entity4 performed impeccably during monday 's episode and had the lead score going into tuesday 's finale			2
fellow competitors @entity45 and @entity46 were right at his heels , with " @entity55 " actress parrish going into tuesday 's finale with a score of 77 and " @entity54 " star @entity51 in second place with a score of 78			1
the three final competitors were challenged to create a fusion dance routine with less than 24 hours to prepare			0
although they all earned perfect scores for their performances on tuesday , neither @entity49 nor @entity51 could overtake @entity4			2
" thank you so much @entity68 for giving @ witneycarson and i the @entity70 , " the actor later posted on @entity62 , along with a photo of himself with @entity13 ; his wife , @entity66 ; and their young son			0
" a dream come true			0
