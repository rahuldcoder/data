@entity1 sen. @entity0 joined @entity4 @entity3 leadership thursday after @entity5 convened thursday to assemble a leadership team for their role as the incoming minority caucus			1
senate majority leader @entity9 , who was elected to continue leading the @entity3 caucus in the minority , said he tapped @entity12 to join thursday because of who she is			1
" i expect her to be @entity0 , " @entity9 said explaining what he expects the @entity16 senator to do as part of the leadership team			1
@entity12 , known for hitting populist notes in stump speeches , said she was excited to join the @entity3 leadership to continue fighting for the middle class			1
" @entity26 is doing very well , ceos are bringing in millions more and families all across this country are struggling , " she said			0
" we have to make this government work for the @entity31 people			0
" and flanked by @entity12 and the two other women who are joining his leadership team ( sens. @entity34 and @entity35 ) , @entity9 said women in the @entity4 have brought positive change to the legislative body			1
" i 've seen this institution change for a lot of reasons , " @entity9 , who has been in @entity39 for three decades , said			2
" one reason it has changed for good is because of women			0
women think differently than men			0
" @entity9 also insisted that @entity5 would stray from replicating what he described as an obstructionist @entity50 minority once his party loses the gavel			2
" this is not get - even time , " @entity9 said			2
" i do not intend to run the @entity3 caucus like the @entity50 caucus has been run in the minority			2
" a @entity4 @entity3 leadership aide said earlier that @entity9 would like @entity12 to join the leadership because he " trusts her and her judgment			1
" and while not every @entity4 @entity62 wants @entity12 , a high - profile , liberal junior senator in a leadership post , the leadership aide said " @entity9 will get his way			1
" sen. @entity65 of @entity66 also joined the leadership team and will head the @entity68 as @entity5 look to reclaim the majority in 2016			1
one @entity3 senator , @entity70 of @entity71 , said the inclusion of @entity12 is a sign the party mistakenly moved away from core @entity3 stances -- such as defending @entity76 on the campaign trail -- and needs to be more focused on middle class issues like raising the minimum wage			1
" there 's nobody better than @entity0 at talking to people who feel this sense of very real economic disenchantment , " @entity70 said			2
despite the mid-term election losses , @entity9 and the other top members of the @entity3 leadership were all re-elected , although two centrist members of the caucus voted against @entity9			1
" when you have an election like this , common sense says we need to change things , " said sen. @entity90 , @entity91			0
" the voice was very loud and unmistakable that most @entity31 , and most @entity99 , want us to change things			0
to me that means changing leadership and it was just that simple			0
" sen. @entity105 said the @entity5 ' problems are deep rooted and change is needed			0
" i voted for a change and that change was not voting for this leadership , " @entity105 told reporters			0
the top @entity50 leaders were all re-elected : sen. @entity112 of @entity113 will become majority leader , flanked by sen. @entity115 of @entity116 , sen. @entity117 of @entity118 , sen. @entity119 of @entity120 and sen. @entity121 of @entity91			0
sen. @entity122 of @entity123 beat out sen. @entity124 of @entity125 to lead the @entity126			0
@entity0 : i 've been treated differently			2

@entity9 said he *picked* @entity12 for the leadership " to be @entity0 "
@entity9 said women have improved the @entity4 's *effectiveness*
