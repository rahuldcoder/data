-- on june 28 , 2007 , @entity2 was the top selling mobile - phone company in the world , people stopped working when they left their computers , @entity8 phones did n't exist , and high - powered executives were addicted to thumbing on their @entity10			1
the next day , @entity12 's first @entity11 went on sale			1
at $ 600 , it was a luxury item at first			1
but five years later , the phone 's dramatic impact can be seen in our daily lives , schools , factories and boardrooms			2
to date , more than 217 million iphones have been sold , and they 're being used by construction workers to read blueprints , doctors to diagnose patients , governments to improve services and parents to quiet their kids in restaurants			0
to ring in its 5th birthday , here are five ways the @entity11 has made a mark on the world			1
photos : our mobile ' addiction ' a new way of interacting with computers in 2007 , we were a nation of skilled texters , banging out @entity45 - filled coded messages at lightning speeds on numerical keypads and physical keyboards			1
the @entity11 was lacking either of those , instead offering a nothing - but - screen keyboard			1
it was a classic @entity12 move toward dead - simple usability , and it helped bring a slice of computing to a whole new audience , including technophobes , kids , senior citizens and people with visual or hearing impairments			2
suddenly , users could navigate their phones with a few swipes of the finger			0
kids intuitively seemed to know how to use it			0
and the phone ushered in a new wave of touchscreen devices			1
after the hefty price tag , the lack of a physical keyboard was the first complaint many reviewers lodged against the @entity11			1
it did n't scare off consumers , though , and @entity12 sold a million iphones in less than three months			0
typing speeds on the @entity11 still may not rival a pair of @entity81 thumbs at their peak , but predictive - text software , spell check and , later , cut and paste have made it a usable alternative			1
in october , @entity12 tried to shake up input again with the introduction of the @entity90 voice - assistant feature			0
the voice - recognition technology encouraged users to speak commands and questions instead of of tapping them in on the screen			0
rise of the app the @entity11 's killer feature was not that tough , expansive glass touchscreen			1
it was the mobile operating system , @entity101 , and the tightly controlled @entity102 released a year later in 2008 that made the @entity11 into , well , whatever you wanted it to be			1
the original device was useful enough : it shipped with a built - in @entity12 apps for checking the @entity108 , weather , e-mail , texts , stocks , calendars and the time			2
but when the @entity102 opened , people suddenly had access to a stockpile of well - designed third - party apps , and developers were able to build an astonishing variety of custom apps			2
with the right app , an @entity11 could track the sun , sync shopping lists , be a drum machine , take restaurant reservations , be a cash register			1
meanwhile , @entity12 's tv ads made " there 's an app for that " into a catchphase and a headline cliche			0
in classic @entity134 style , @entity12 took complete control of the sales and app - approval ecosystem			0
apps have to be approved by @entity12 before they can be sold , meaning fewer spam apps and viruses make it through to consumers			2
it also means the company can reject apps as it pleases -- say , when a feature competes with an @entity12 product -- to the occasional displeasure of the developer community			2
the @entity102 has also created a new mini-economy			0
@entity12 has paid out more than $ 5 billion to developers , and that 's after taking a 30 % cut off all app sales for itself			0
today , there are more than 650,000 mobile apps available in the @entity102 , ranging from free to $ 1,000 for specialized business applications			1
24/7 internet the @entity11 ushered in an age of all internet , all the time			2
for better or worse , it 's blurred the lines between work and home lives , made communication a round - the - clock habit and led to a host of new rules about when and how it 's appropriate to use smartphones ( not while walking , driving , playing trivia or on a date , please )			0
the phone , whose price soon dropped to $ 200 or less with a two - year wireless contract , gave users instant access to a multitude of ways to communicate : texts , e-mail , @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186			1
there 's even a so - so phone on there			0
mobile phones had limited internet access before the @entity11 , but the device 's browser was a huge improvement , displaying webpages more like they actually looked on a desktop computer			1
all this connectivity brought a new disorder : smartphone addiction			1
a recent study by gadget - resale site @entity202 found that 15 % of respondents would rather give up sex than go without their iphones for a weekend			0
that type of titillating stat is not surprising to anyone for whom the @entity11 is the last thing they see at night and first thing they check in the morning			2
supply - chain activism as @entity12 grew from underdog into the largest company in the world by market cap ( it made $ 108 billion in 2011 ) , its manufacturing chain was pushed to greater and greater limits -- and into the spotlight			2
the @entity223 plants in @entity224 that produce @entity12 's iphones , @entity226 and other products were called out in the press and by activist groups for poor working conditions , long hours and low wages			0
while bad press for @entity12 , the controversy drew much - needed attention to electronics supply chains			0
the @entity223 plant was called out for producing @entity12 products , although it also assembles products for other major electronics companies including @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 and @entity243			0
to quell the backlash , major tech companies are feeling the pressure and changing how they operate			0
when he took over as @entity12 ceo , @entity247 agreed to allow a third party , the @entity249 , audit its @entity224 factories and address any issues that were found			0
and just this week , @entity252 unveiled a media - streaming device , the @entity253 , which is made in the @entity254 an industry revived the @entity11 may have helped kill the @entity81 , but it gave birth to a new beefed - up genre of mobile devices			1
@entity252 went on to release its own more developer - friendly mobile operating system , @entity8			0
@entity240 threw its hat into the ring with @entity262 os. most major mobile phone companies now produce touchscreen smartphones			1
some might say the @entity11 and its cousin , the @entity266 , helped spawn the larger @entity226 , with its identical touchscreen interface			1
that hit device was birthed in 2010 and quickly created a new gadget market , leaving rivals scrambling to catch up			0
now @entity271 , @entity252 and @entity240 all have new or forthcoming tablets			0
the @entity11 's popularity as a portable gaming device -- oh , how we love flinging virtual birds at virtual pigs ! -- also helped usher in a new era of mobile gaming			1
five years after the @entity11 hit the market -- and the culture -- the tech industry as a whole is thriving and innovating			1
it probably wo n't be another five years before the next big thing shakes up technology again			0
' @entity81 , ' @entity286 , @entity12 get just desserts			2

@entity11 went on sale june *29* , 2007 , when @entity2 and @entity81 ruled the phone world
despite its hefty price tag ( $ 600 for the basic model ) , the @entity11 was an immediate hit
the phone helped *pioneer* touchscreen interfaces , mobile apps , smartphone addiction
