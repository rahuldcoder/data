-- like a 3 - year - old who thinks he 's just discovered the wheel , billionaire @entity1 is reveling over his startling new gun control tool : the grass roots			1
this is where it hurts to be the neophyte on the block			0
@entity1 : we will fight the @entity12 with common sense in the 1980s , when " handgun control " was at its prime , its objective was to compete with the @entity19 movement in organizing the grass roots			1
when " handgun control " become politically incorrect , the reformulated @entity21 pronounced that its objective was to match pro-gunner 's formidable grass - roots efforts with its own			0
in fact , efforts in 2013 to pass @entity27 's gun control policies were fueled by perhaps the biggest " grass - roots " organization that the " left " has mustered : @entity27 's " @entity31			2
" yet , this effort , too , fell short			0
it 's not for lack of trying that gun control has failed			2
nor is it for lack of arrogance			0
in fact , @entity1 , who just announced that he will drop $ 50 million on so - called " gun safety " efforts , showed the arrogance of a dilettante breezing into a @entity45 restaurant by proclaiming he does n't need @entity48 's permission to enter heaven			1
said @entity1 : " if there is a @entity48 , when i get to heaven , i 'm not stopping to be interviewed			2
i am heading straight in			0
i have earned my place in heaven			0
it 's not even close			0
" ( beware anyone who thought they would be enjoying " @entity57 " in the afterlife			0
) but @entity1 's " arrogance of wealth " may be precisely his downfall			1
gun owners are smarter than @entity1			1
in 2013 , after the @entity66 incident , our members were more than capable of reading @entity1 's duplicitous background check legislation and understanding what it actually did : open a back door to gun registration			1
gun owners also watched , incredulously , when @entity1 's minions cheered @entity45 and @entity75 's massive gun bans and gun registration requirements -- only to deny , in @entity77 , that they supported either of these things			1
furthermore , gun owners understand that they have everything on the line			1
they understand that , in places such as @entity45 , the government has been sending letters demanding the confiscation of guns in violation of a 2010 city ordinance			2
and they understand that , for them , this is more than a " billionaire hobby " like a yacht or private plane			0
gun owners are not hypocrites			1
they resent it when @entity1 insists on his 17 - man armed security detail for himself while denying them the right to protect themselves or their families			2
so my message to @entity1 is this : spend it all			1
@entity1 's hatred and hypocrisy has only energized our people , who have enacted 70 pro-gun state laws since @entity66 -- twice the number of @entity1 anti-gun laws that have been enacted around the country			1
let billionaire @entity1 sweep into @entity117 and @entity118 and pretend he can buy the people in those states			2
he will only energize other gun groups who will be forced to oppose red state democrats			0
and the prospects of a sweeping @entity127 victory will be even greater			0
join us on @entity130 / @entity129 .			0

@entity132 says @entity1 's idea to spend $ 50 million on gun safety will fail
he points to the former @entity45 mayor 's " arrogance of wealth " being his downfall
