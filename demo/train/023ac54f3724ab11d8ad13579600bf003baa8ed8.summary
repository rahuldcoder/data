-- investigators looking into the crash of a @entity4 jet over @entity5 face a series of unusual challenges			1
from access to the debris , to volatile militant activity in the area , here 's a look at some investigation concerns after the plane with 298 people aboard fell from the sky			1
who will lead the investigation ? the answer is not so clear - cut			2
but aviation experts say an investigation should not include parties involved in the conflict between @entity5 and @entity26 - backed separatists			1
@entity5 president @entity27 said experts from the @entity29 , an agency of the @entity30 , have joined the @entity31 , @entity32 and the @entity33 on a special commission			1
@entity32 prime minister @entity35 called for an international team to have full access to the crash site			2
what will happen to plane 's data recorders ? the families of people on board will demand a transparent international investigation , and so will the global community , @entity0 aviation analyst @entity42 said			2
finding and examining the plane 's data recorders will be key -- but the fact that the crash occurred in such a volatile region makes what comes next anything but certain , @entity0 aviation analyst @entity48 said			1
" the big question will be , in whose hands will they fall , and will this be a really objective , international investigation ? " he said			2
who will win the blame game ? @entity62 and @entity63 have said it was a surface - to - air missile that brought down the @entity65 , though the @entity33 could n't say who fired the weapon			1
@entity68 , adviser to the @entity69 , said in a @entity71 post that " terrorists " fired on the plane operating a @entity74 surface - to - air missile system			0
@entity32 's government said it was n't ready to say what happened			0
a spokesman for @entity26 president @entity79 said any talk of @entity26 being involved is " stupidity			0
" @entity79 said @entity5 's military campaign against the separatists was to blame , but he did n't accuse either side for the suspected shoot - down			1
what evidence do officials have so far ? @entity5 's state security chief accused two @entity26 military intelligence officers of involvement and said they must be punished			1
@entity91 said he based his allegation on intercepts of phone conversations between the two officers			0
" now you know who carried out this crime			0
we will do everything for the @entity26 military who carried out this crime to be punished , " he told reporters			0
@entity105 , a former senior official for the @entity106 and @entity107 , said that after an incident , people start to talk and intelligence agencies , like the @entity110 , will pick up on those conversations			1
how did officials conclude it was a missile attack ? the @entity33 came to the conclusion of a missile attack through radar data			1
a @entity33 radar system saw a surface - to - air missile system turn on and track an aircraft right before the plane was shot down , a senior @entity33 official told @entity0			1
a second system saw a heat signature -- which would indicate a missile rising from the ground into the air -- at the time the airliner was hit , the official explained			0
the wreckage path , @entity48 said , will also reveal a lot			0
if a plane breaks up in midair , which is likely what would happen in a missile strike , there would be a large swath of wreckage , he said , but if it breaks down due to mechanical failure , the debris field would be more concentrated			0
how long will it take to determine who was responsible ? @entity79 probably knew thursday what happened , according to @entity105 , who said @entity26 is one of a few countries with the capability to follow missiles			0
@entity147 will probably walk into the @entity148 on friday to find an assessment that gives a pretty clear picture on where the missile was launched			0
that report will be based on human and technical sources such as radar			0
are separatists giving investigators access to crash site ? the area where the plane crashed is n't under control of authorities in @entity63			1
@entity164 separatists were in control of the site thursday night , according to @entity167 , a freelance journalist on the scene			1
separatists were among the first to the crash site and some of them went through the wreckage			1
photos of the crash site show people standing on pieces of the wreckage			0
" the mere fact that this is not a secure , sterile site at the moment -- is of concern , " @entity42 said			0
@entity0 senior international correspondent @entity183 said that it was hours before five government rescue teams were allowed into the crash area and armed groups were getting in the way of their work			1
phone calls intercepted by @entity5 authorities indicate some of the debris was being looted and taken away			2
what role will the @entity33 play ? it certainly will get involved on the ground if any of the passengers are @entity33			1
and it likely will send a team from the @entity197 because the @entity198 was built in the @entity33			2
@entity197 officials said thursday they are waiting to see how they will be involved , but a senior administration official told @entity0 a team would go in an advisory capacity			0
the @entity106 would also send agents , the official said			0
there are complications , however , because the area where the plan crashed is n't under control of authorities in @entity63			2
and @entity33 authorities likely would n't be able to travel to territory controlled by separatists in eastern @entity5 who have declared themselves independent			1
@entity33 intelligence agencies are analyzing the trajectory of the missile to try to learn where the attack came from			1
it will also look through satellite images to pinpoint the launch spot			0
the @entity223 would assist in diplomatic discussions between @entity5 and @entity26			2
it would also help families of victims , if any of those on board had ties to the @entity33			2
@entity0 's @entity230 , @entity231 , @entity232 and @entity233 contributed to this report .			0

experts : investigation should not include parties involved in @entity5 conflict
intelligence agencies likely to have assessments by friday
@entity33 will help in several areas , including diplomacy
the fact that @entity249 separatists control the crash area will *hamper* the investigation
