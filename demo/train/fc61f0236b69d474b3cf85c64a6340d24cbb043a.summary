president @entity0 might soon find himself in a quandary in which basic arithmetic prevents him from faithfully executing all of the laws @entity4 has passed			1
the debt ceiling statute prohibits borrowing enough money to make up the difference between funds in the @entity10 and legal obligations to spend			1
anything the president does would violate some law			0
indeed , anything he does would be unconstitutional because all of the relevant powers -- spending , taxing and borrowing -- belong to @entity4			1
many @entity21 insiders have assumed that if @entity4 fails to raise the debt ceiling , @entity0 could simply cut spending			1
but constitutional history says otherwise			0
when president @entity26 tried to " impound " money that @entity4 had ordered him to spend , the courts slapped him down			1
during @entity31 's administration , the @entity29 ruled that the president has only a limited ability to cut spending even with congressional authorization			0
he has no constitutional power to cut spending without such authorization			0
if every action the president might plausibly take would usurp a power of @entity4 , what should he do ? he should minimize the usurpation			2
during the @entity45 , president @entity44 unilaterally suspended habeas corpus			0
@entity44 argued that if that decision was unconstitutional , it was nonetheless necessary to avoid a greater evil : violating his constitutional oath to defend the @entity51			2
faced with a dilemma , @entity44 chose the less unconstitutional course			0
the same goes for this president from @entity55			0
if @entity4 creates a trilemma , he must choose the least unconstitutional option			2
some commentators suggest that the @entity10 could generate $ 2 trillion for the government by minting two platinum coins , using an obscure law that was enacted for the express purpose of creating memorabilia			0
but doing so would be economically equivalent to borrowing $ 2 trillion and thus , even if technically legal , would violate the substance of the debt ceiling law			1
in a constitutional crisis , analysis should rest on constitutional principles , not technicalities			0
the core issue is separation of powers : what course of action would minimize the executive taking over legislative authority ? the answer is violating the debt ceiling , not cutting spending or raising taxes			1
by borrowing exactly enough money to cover the difference between funds in the @entity10 and expenditures required by law , the president would simply be implementing @entity4 ' budget			1
by contrast , a presidential decision to raise taxes or cut spending would require many policy - laden judgments : whose taxes would be raised and by how much ? what expenditures would be cut , to what degree and according to what criteria ? for the president to make these quintessentially legislative judgments on his own would usurp power on an enormous scale			0
issuing debt beyond the debt ceiling would be unconstitutional but not as unconstitutional as raising taxes or cutting spending			1
despite some confusion , @entity0 has kept the least unconstitutional option on the table			2
in december , @entity111 press secretary @entity110 said that the " administration does not believe that the @entity113 gives the president the power to ignore the debt ceiling			1
" that observation is beside the point			0
true , some scholars argue that the debt ceiling violates @entity121 of the 14th amendment			2
if so , then the debt ceiling is void and the president 's power to borrow money comes , not from the 14th amendment , but from the statute authorizing the treasury secretary to " borrow on the credit of the @entity131 government amounts necessary for expenditures authorized by law			1
" putting aside the 14th amendment , @entity110 's claim at most shows that unilaterally raising the debt ceiling would override @entity4 ' borrowing authority			1
but that merely states one horn of the trilemma			0
unilaterally raising taxes or cutting spending would usurp more congressional authority			0
our leaders can still act responsibly by raising the debt ceiling or , better yet , by repealing it entirely			2
@entity4 can then control federal debt simply by paying attention to the gap between spending and taxes			2
it should not force the president to usurp one of its powers			0
but if @entity4 leaves the president no constitutional options , he must choose the least unconstitutional one : borrowing money beyond the debt ceiling .			1

writers : debt ceiling puts @entity0 in a trap ; executing law means violating others
a president can not authorize spending , taxing or borrowing to avoid ceiling , they say
writers : he should borrow exactly enough money to implement @entity4 ' budget
that move would be the least unconstitutional solution to his " trilemma , " they say
