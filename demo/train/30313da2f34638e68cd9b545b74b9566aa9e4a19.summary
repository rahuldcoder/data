-- it is not everywhere in the @entity2 that the assassination of a security chief is accompanied by popular grief and with a funeral akin to a hero			0
in fact most of the revolts in the @entity9 are against systems in which oppression is mainly conducted by such heads of security , the dreaded moukhabarat rule			0
the killing of brigadier general @entity17 in a car bomb in @entity19 last week is the latest of a series of assassinations and explosions that have become associated with that city			0
gen. @entity17 a pivotal , ' polarizing ' figure one such explosion was the @entity28 bombing of the october 23 , 1983 , which caused the death of 241 @entity32 soldiers , an anniversary that was not mentioned in the @entity32 presidential foreign policy debate			1
however , the link between this attack and @entity32 engagement with the @entity39 regime -- both the father @entity40 , and then the son @entity41 -- would have been useful in evaluating the impact of @entity32 policies on @entity44 and on the region			1
following the @entity47 bombing the @entity32 " redeployed " its troops from @entity44 and there followed a series of hostage - taking of @entity32 and @entity53 citizens			1
the hostages were taken by @entity57 / @entity56 proxies in @entity44 and were later released in @entity58 with the @entity60 administration reluctantly having to thank @entity39 and re-engage with @entity57 if only to coordinate the repatriation of the hostages			2
this soon became a habit , with a gradual acknowledgement of @entity57 's role in resolving @entity44 problems -- albeit problems that @entity57 had a hand in creating in the first place			1
this engagement culminated in @entity39 being given a free hand in @entity44 as part of the incentives for @entity57 joining the @entity76 coalition to oust @entity77 from @entity78 in 1990			2
the lesson was that @entity32 protection is whimsical -- in order to protect the sovereignty of one small country , @entity78 , from its ambitious neighbor , another small country , @entity44 , was sold down the river to an equally ambitious neighbor , @entity57			1
on the @entity32 side , the conclusion was the opposite - the belief that @entity92 brings peace and stability to @entity44			2
this stability lasted for about 15 years during which the @entity57 moukhabarat penetrated every institution and organization in the country			0
this included the army , security services , parliament , ministries and even political parties and the religious establishment			0
another turn in @entity32 - @entity57 relations was in 2004 when @entity32 president @entity109			2
@entity110 and @entity112 counterpart @entity111 patched up their differences over @entity115 by sponsoring @entity117 resolution 1559 calling for @entity57 to withdraw from @entity44 and to stop interfering in the affairs of the country			2
the deal was off , @entity57 withdrew its army but there was a return of instability , wars and assassinations in @entity44 till the summer of 2008 when the west re-engaged			2
the @entity129 agreement in may 2008 , accompanied by @entity131 re-engagement with @entity57 , came after @entity57 's allies had withdrawn from government , blocked parliament , occupied the city center of @entity19 for 18 months and a @entity137 - led attack on the city in may			1
all of this came while @entity141 politicians and journalists were being assassinated			0
the agreement restored @entity57 influence in the country , again with @entity131 blessing , this time under the guise of a @entity147			2
assassinations stopped , stability returned , and eventually a fully @entity151 government was formed , almost coup like , where some @entity153 allies were coerced to switching side or the country would face renewed chaos			0
again the @entity131 engaged @entity57 to bring back stability to @entity44			1
the pattern emerges where @entity44 is like a hostage , and the @entity131 the subject of extortion			1
the success of this model of @entity131 relations with @entity57 encouraged the @entity39 regime to replicate it throughout the region			1
thus agreements between the @entity169 from @entity170 and @entity171 were blocked , and @entity39 promised to facilitate them ; @entity174 - type terrorists were infiltrating @entity115 from @entity57 , and @entity39 promised to control that border ; the @entity176 created problems for @entity178 and @entity39 promised to suppress it in @entity57			0
this was all in the same way that @entity137 was armed through @entity57 and @entity39 promised to control it too			0
the 2011 revolt against @entity183 in @entity57 came as a total surprise to a @entity32 administration still enjoying their honeymoon with him			1
key administration officials repeatedly visited @entity58 and believed in @entity183 's promises of stability in the region and peace with @entity192 , thus vindicating their own policy of engagement and dialogue instead of that of isolation , intervention and regime change associated with the @entity110 period			1
@entity17 was appointed in 2005 as head of one of the new @entity44 security branches , free from @entity57 infestation , that were set up after the assassination of former prime minister @entity153			0
he was at the forefront of the international investigation that preceded the setting up of the @entity210 ( @entity210 ) and his unit collaborated with over 30 international teams and trained in the most advanced forensic techniques			0
other members of his team were also the targets of assassination			0
the unit is said to have foiled over 35 assassination plots , disrupted terrorist networks and uncovered spy rings			0
@entity223 's latest exploit may have been a step too far			0
whether true or not , many in @entity44 immediately suspected @entity183 's regime in the assassination			1
if they did kill the man who was in charge of protecting the country , the message to @entity44 and the @entity131 is clearly that the @entity39 regime can still do a lot of damage to the region unless it is left alone to finish the job of suppressing the revolution			1
@entity44 and @entity57 , who watched the presidential foreign policy debate with great anxiety , are worried about whether @entity183 's blackmail still works , and would have found little comfort in the lack of will of both candidates to take any decisive moves against the @entity57 regime			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity251 .			0

@entity251 says the @entity19 attack would be a useful moment to evaluate @entity32 regional policy
*history* ' shows pattern where @entity44 is like a hostage , the @entity131 the subject of extortion '
@entity251 : @entity44 , @entity57 are worried over whether @entity183 's ' blackmail ' still works
@entity251 : little will from @entity32 presidential candidates to make decisive move against regime
