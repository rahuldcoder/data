-- those hardy micro-brewing pioneers of the first @entity2 in 1988 were looking for some free advertising and a few people to taste the beers they were brewing in tanks scavenged from dairies , food processing plants and -- yes -- a never - used nuclear power plant			1
they hoped 5,000 people might drop by and they corralled their buddies into manning the taps , promising a leisurely day of suds and sun at @entity15 , @entity17 's @entity16 on the @entity18			1
more than 15,000 people came and chaos reigned			0
coolers did n't work right			0
the beer poured foamy , warm , then not at all because the kegs were dry			2
brewers scurried back to their breweries for more kegs			0
the owner of @entity29 drove nearly 200 miles from @entity30 with all the brewery 's spare beer -- nine mini kegs			2
the crowd drained those too , and loved it all			0
@entity38 's @entity37 was born			2
" i had traveled to @entity37 in @entity41 and knew what a big beer party was like , " says @entity39 , who now owns the festival			1
" i wanted to create that atmosphere			0
" the 27th @entity2 begins wednesday , when a parade of hundreds of brewers and beer fans troops across @entity15 's @entity48 to the park , where grand marshal @entity50 will tap the first keg			1
hundreds more will be consumed over five days by a crowd of more than 80,000			0
family - friendly behemoth from shaky beginnings , the @entity2 has become perhaps the largest outdoor craft beer festival in the country , a sprawling , family - friendly behemoth that attracts visitors from around the world			1
it 's the spiritual home of @entity17 craft brewing and the crown jewel of the city known as @entity66 : @entity15 , @entity17			1
@entity68 's @entity67 is older by six years and offers more beers -- 3,100 last year to the @entity2 's 80 or so			1
tickets cost $ 80 : admission to the @entity2 is free and a tasting glass costs $ 7			2
the @entity67 is n't a family event : its 40,000 attendees sign up for one of several sessions in a convention hall chockablock with beer fans intent on sampling all 3,100 beers , not in a grassy park on a glorious late july weekend with big white pavilions , ranks of picnic tables and riverine breezes a-wafting			1
serious beer judging is a big part of the @entity67 , where a couple hundred medals are awarded in dozens of categories			0
in best laid back @entity17 fashion , the @entity2 does n't award medals and lets the crowd be the judge of which beers are its favorite			2
" the @entity67 was the first , and it was their show , " said @entity39			0
" we did n't want to copy them , so whatever they did , we pretty much went the other way			0
" it 's a very different festival in that sense , and that 's why it 's grown and evolved			0
" @entity2 , july 23 - 27 , 2014 , @entity16 , @entity15 , @entity17			1
