-- @entity6 's upcoming " agents of @entity5 " is one of fall tv 's most anticipated new shows			1
the cast and producers were on hand at @entity10 to preview the series , which was created by " @entity13 " director @entity12 and will premiere on @entity14 on september 24			1
those who attended the panel were treated to far more than just a teaser ; the entire premiere episode was screened for the hall of fans , who gave the episode a standing ovation during the credits			2
the series follows @entity25 ( @entity26 ) , a @entity5 employee who seemingly died at the hands of villain @entity28 in the " @entity13 " movie			1

" i did n't like being dead , " @entity26 said			0
" but i really loved my death			0
i never thought anything could top that			0
i 'm a longtime @entity6 fan , so i just ca n't believe this is happening to me			1

" it 's what happens to you that brings them together			0
' it was so amazing what @entity12 did and wrote			2
it was the greatest thing i 'd done , and i was really pleased and proud			0
" " @entity5 " ( @entity53 and @entity54 ) extends the world created in the recent @entity6 films , including " @entity13 , " " @entity50 , " " @entity51 " and " @entity52			1
" while @entity12 would n't confirm whether those characters show up on the program , he did n't rule out the possibility either			1
" we may see some people [ from the films ] and we may see some people from the @entity63 who are not cinematic , " @entity12 said			1
" but the most important thing is that we get to see these people who are here every week			0
so probably ( some of those characters will appear ) , but i ca n't say when because that would spoil it			2
" the show will introduce several new actors , and the producers see " @entity74			2
@entity54 " as a true team effort			0
agent @entity77 ( @entity78 ) is in the pilot episode , newcomer @entity76 plays agent @entity80 while @entity81 plays a mysterious character named @entity83 whose true intentions come to light in the pilot			1

" the endless possibilities we have between them and among them and in their pasts and in their futures and their interactions			0
there 's stuff we 've taken from the @entity63 , stuff we 're bringing to the @entity63			0
