-- rep. @entity1 made news this weekend by announcing that pregnancy from " legitimate rape " is rare			1
he further argued that physicians had told him that women who were traumatized in such a way had biological things happen in their bodies to " shut down " the " whole thing " so that fertilization wo n't occur			2
there 's so much wrong here that it 's hard to know where to begin			1
let 's start with the basics			1
the human body is intricately designed and exquisitely evolved to make procreation possible			1
in fact , some would argue that it 's our primary purpose			1
so you have to understand that everything about our biology is there to make it easier , not harder , for a woman to get pregnant			1
women can get pregnant if intercourse happens under water			2
women can get pregnant from sex in any position			2
women can get pregnant even when they think that they ca n't get pregnant due to menstruation			2
if you put sperm near egg , women can get pregnant			2
republicans distancing themselves from @entity1 remarks there is nothing at all about a woman 's mindset that affects this			1
women ca n't wish pregnancy away			1
if they could , then many teen pregnancies would n't occur ; few teens want to get pregnant			2
but think of the larger picture			0
women in abusive relationships get pregnant			0
women in horrible socioeconomic conditions get pregnant			0
and , yes , women who have been raped get pregnant			0
the body does n't differentiate between " legitimate " rape and " illegitimate " rape -- whatever that is			1
the body does n't know whether the rapist is known to a victim			0
the body does n't know if a knife or a gun , or alcohol or drugs ( or any combination of them ) , were used			0
every sexual encounter does not lead to pregnancy , but every sexual encounter leads to the possibility of pregnancy			1
@entity1 flub puts abortion at center of campaign debate so why would someone say such a thing ? while it 's hard to get into the mind of another individual , we can guess			1
this line of reasoning is n't new			0
it 's been used for the most part to delegitimize the idea that exceptions to abortion prohibitions should exist for rape			1
after all , if you really believe that abortion is the taking of a human life , then it 's hard to suggest that there is any rationalization for it at all			1
while ethically consistent , this belief is rare in the @entity103			1
even among those who oppose abortion , most people support exceptions for rape and incest			1
it 's hard for a politician who firmly opposes abortion to square this			1
such a person wants the support of a majority of people but does n't want to compromise principles			0
one option , then , is to find a way to make the occurrence of the problem nonexistent			1
if pregnancy from rape does n't happen , then we do n't need exceptions in the law			1
the problem , of course , is that such pregnancies do occur			0
more than 31,000 of them happen in @entity103 every year			0
pretending they do n't by listening to a few anecdotes wo n't make them go away			1
this is what happens when reality gets in the way of our moral convictions			1
it 's nuanced and complicated and often fraught with contradictions			2
contrary to what you read , most people do n't have black and white views of abortion			0
few believe that it should be prohibited when it might save the life of a mother			0
few believe that it should be allowed a week before a fetus is full - term			0
in other words , relatively few people believe abortion should never be legal , and few believe it should always be legal			0
this places abortion in the gray zone			0
that does n't work well for elections			0
it also does n't make for clean philosophical discussions			2
it certainly does n't make for good sound bites			2
a further problem with proclamations like @entity1 's , though , is what they sound like to women who have been raped			1
if you believe what he does , then anyone who did get pregnant was n't " legitimately " raped			0
moreover , it belies a willful ignorance of science			2
rape has occurred in history time and time again			2
women get pregnant from it			0
there is no debate to be had			0
opinion : why @entity189 is not bad for women those who support republicans , and even @entity1 , in this election believe this to be a distraction and a problem			1
history shows that statements like this can turn close elections			0
a win in @entity203 for the @entity204 may mean that they retain control of the @entity207			0
moreover , this will be what we are talking about this week instead of the economy , jobs , or health care reform			0
that 's bad for @entity215 and @entity189			2
the good news is that all of this is avoidable			0
if people did that more , they would n't have to claim they " misspoke " later			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity223 .			1

rep. @entity1 said pregnancy from " legitimate rape " is rare
@entity223 says he 's wrong : humans are designed to *reproduce*
he says @entity1 probably aimed to make prohibition of abortions square with an ( *alternate* ) reality
@entity223 : @entity1 's *ludicrous* remark is distraction republicans could avoid if they stuck to science
