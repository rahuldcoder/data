@entity0 -- @entity3 's small business is a rare success in a sea of hard - luck stories			1
the owner of several popular bookstore cafes , called " @entity9 " in the @entity0 area , @entity3 said his annual revenue tops $ 14 million			1
but the success has n't persuaded his bank to give him the loan he wants to expand two of his stores and add 40 employees			1
@entity3 said the only way his bank would lend him money was if he used his home as collateral			0
" i want to have a loan that 's really a business loan that 's going to use my business as collateral , " @entity3 told @entity1			1
" and i was told no , in these economic times it 's very difficult for banks to give money this way			0
" small - business owners across the country have voiced similar frustrations , complaining that -- despite billions of taxpayer dollars in relief funds and exhortations from lawmakers to help @entity36 -- banks are still holding back on loans			2
president @entity39 will tackle the issue monday when he meets with bank leaders to discuss upcoming financial regulatory reform			1
he is expected to push banks to increase small - business lending , along with a host of other reforms to the industry			1
but industry analysts say the liquidity problem wo n't be easily solved			0
one small - business expert said stricter government regulations have pulled banks in two directions			1
" the banks are going to say , ' look , it 's not like we do n't want to lend , it 's that we 're constrained from lending as a result of the new focus and the new attention from the crisis , " said @entity54 , an analyst with @entity55			1
" [ they will say ] ' the regulators are telling us you need to be more careful , you need to have more capital , your capital needs to be more liquid			0
' " @entity67 , who represents some of the country 's largest financial firms at @entity70 , said banks are still lending , but they 've gotten more wary of potential risk			2
" you 've seen an increase or a tightening of the credit standards , " @entity67 said			0
" so banks are cautious now about lending in terms of who our borrower is			2
we 're looking to make good , solid loans that can be repaid			0
" he said financial institutions are also wary of the legislation moving through @entity86 that would impose new regulations on the industry and , @entity67 said , make it costlier for banks to operate			2
the @entity91 passed a sweeping financial reform bill friday , and a @entity94 committee is working on similar legislation			0
@entity91 officials told @entity1 that when the president meets with top bankers monday , he will insist the reforms are necessary to prevent another fiscal crisis			1
meanwhile , @entity3 hopes lawmakers take action soon			0
" you 've got to really give that money back to the source that 's going to provide the most amount of jobs , the most amount of economic stimulus for the economy , " he said			0
" that 's small businesses			0
