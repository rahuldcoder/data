-- despite public perception , @entity1 is hot			1
sure , summer temperatures rarely rise above 13 c , but the small @entity6 country has become a holiday superstar			0
tourism has nearly doubled since 2000 ( last year saw over 565,000 visitors ) , but while tourism has helped jolt @entity1 out of recession , the country is courting a different demographic : it wants to woo business travelers			1
" the tourism numbers fluctuate a lot , depending on the season , whereas corporate travel is distributed more evenly throughout the year , " explains @entity15 , managing director of @entity16 in @entity17 , the official convention bureau for the @entity19 capital			2
hoping to tap into the events market , @entity17 has set to work building its conference infrastructure			2
perhaps the most prominent display of the city 's corporate courtship is the newly built @entity29 , a combo concert hall and convention center that opened may 2011			1
a joint effort by @entity19 - @entity34 artist @entity33 , @entity35 and @entity36 , @entity29 is one of the most cutting - edge conference centers in the world			1
its glittery , disco - like facade is meant to mimic the country 's stunning glacial surrounds , while the interior evokes @entity1 's lava fields			1

each of @entity29 's four concert halls has a large overhead reflector system and acoustics control chambers , all of which are intended to produce a superior sound			1
" we may be a small country , but we 've got big ideas , " says @entity56 , @entity29 's conference director			1
though the venue is in its early days , and @entity60 reckons it takes up to five years to market a new conference hall , @entity29 has already booked some big gigs			1
" if you 're a manager , and you 're risk - adverse , you might be hesitant to send several hundred of your best employees overseas somewhere , especially if you 're not fully sure of how evolved the infrastructure is in that place , " says @entity15			0
" people who have been here already know how state - of - the art our technology and infrastructure are , but there are some who have no idea , and they might think of @entity1 as primitive , in a sense			1
our focus right now is in trying to shift that perception			0
" see also : @entity1 bouncing back on tourism boom another advantage that managers may not be privy to is the convenience of @entity1 's location			2
though it may seem like a distant land , the country is a mere three - hour flight from central @entity87 , and five hours from many @entity89 destinations			1
meet in @entity17 has adopted the slogan " meet in the middle , " a reference to both the country 's handy midway coordinates , and to the historic @entity90 , where former @entity92 president @entity91 met with general secretary of the @entity96 's @entity95 @entity94 in 1986 , to negotiate arms control			2
" it will be a long time before we get another meeting as prominent as the @entity90 , " says @entity15			0
" though one could say that it was the starting point for @entity1 becoming a destination for meetings			1
" the national carrier , @entity110 , has also been a major factor in developing the country 's connectivity with the world			0
over the last few years it has developed its flight network , increasing both the number and frequency of direct routes			0
" we have great connections from the [ @entity122 ] @entity92 to @entity1 , and that puts us in a strong market position , " notes @entity56			1
watch video : @entity127 's presidential tour of @entity1 but perhaps the country 's greatest sell is its natural beauty			2
the @entity131 -- the most visited sight in @entity1 -- is also set up for meetings and conferences			1
there are board rooms and theaters that can accommodate up to 90 guests , and which overlook the lava fields , glaciers , waterfalls and the lagoon itself			0
some companies even hold meetings in the midst of the steaming waters			0
" the @entity131 brings more energy to business groups , and makes corporate events more fun and productive , " notes @entity147 , the director of public relations for @entity1			1
@entity15 attended one such meeting while a management consultant at @entity154			0
" there were 30 of us standing in the blue water , watching the snow come from the sky while discussing the values of the company , " said @entity15			0
" it literally blew the socks off everybody there			0
" six weeks earlier , we 'd had an event in @entity167			0
it was very nice , and memorable , but nothing close to how distinctive the @entity131 was			2
" as if the setting was n't unique enough , @entity131 has also arranged djs , circuses and modern dance performers for corporate events			2
" it 's in keeping with the spirit of the setting , " notes @entity147 .			0

@entity1 is trying to *attract* more business travelers
it is pitching itself as a halfway point between @entity87 and the @entity92
