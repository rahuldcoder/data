-- @entity1 , the 18 time league winner and five - time champion of @entity4 , was humiliated by third - tier @entity5 3 - 2 in the @entity6 , the most famous domestic cup competition in world football			1
the @entity10 club , which is owned by @entity12 businessman @entity11 , was embarrassed by a team currently struggling towards the bottom of its own division			0
on a freezing cold sunday in the north of @entity18 , around 14 kilometers from @entity19 , @entity5 produced one of the greatest results in its recent history to defeat the seven time @entity6 winners			1
@entity25 , @entity26 or @entity27 : which is the biggest club ? facing the likes of $ 35 million man @entity31 and a whole host of international players , @entity5 turned to a man who up until 18 months ago had given up on playing professional football to try his luck at university			0
@entity38 , 23 , attended the @entity39 where he gained a degree in @entity41 while playing part - time amateur football			0
but after completing his studies , he rejoined @entity5 and etched his name into @entity6 folklore by scoring twice before dislocating his shoulder in an enthralling contest			2
leading 1 - 0 through @entity38 's third minute strike , @entity31 equalized for @entity1 before @entity5 scored two quick goals either side of the break			1
first , @entity38 took advantage of some awful goalkeeping by @entity54 to fire home his second with @entity57 heading @entity5 into a 3 - 1 lead just minutes after the interval			1
@entity60 joins @entity1 @entity61 , a $ 23.6 million signing , volleyed @entity1 back into the contest courtesy of a huge deflection , but @entity5 held out for a famous victory			2
it was a return to the glory days for the club , which reached the 1994 @entity6 semifinals where it was eventually beaten by @entity27 in a replay			0
it was that year which also saw @entity5 relegated from the @entity10 -- a division which the club has not been able to return to since			1
@entity5 , which is managed by former @entity74 and @entity75 striker @entity73 , will now face @entity1 's @entity77 rival , @entity76			2
" i am left speechless by the result			0
we went out there wanting to battle together , " hero @entity38 told reporters			0

" the @entity6 was a competition we wanted to have a go at and there is no excuse , " he told reporters			0
" we put out a strong team capable of winning the game , but we did n't			0
" hazard charged with violent conduct @entity5 's triumph capped a remarkable day of cup action in @entity18 where @entity103 champion @entity101 was fortunate to escape with a 2 - 2 draw at third - tier @entity105			1
@entity105 , which is less than 10 kilometers from its illustrious west @entity107 rival , had taken the lead twice , only for @entity101 to snatch an 83rd minute equalizer through $ 80 million striker @entity110			1
it was an impressive showing from minnow @entity105 against defending champion @entity101 , which is unbeaten in its past 25 @entity6 matches			1
eden a hazard to @entity101 's public image ? @entity105 , which is managed by @entity118 @entity117 , will now go to @entity119 for a replay in a game which is estimated to earn it around $ 1.6 million			2
the winner of that fixture will go on to play at @entity124 in the fifth round			0
@entity126 : the man who saved @entity27 -- twice there was also drama at @entity130 where the first - tier side defeated eight time winners @entity133 2 - 1			1
@entity130 , which was relegated from the top - flight in 2004 , now faces an away game at @entity10 champion @entity75			2
meanwhile , @entity137 , which became the first non-league side to ever beat a @entity10 team following the 1 - 0 win at @entity141 on saturday , will play first - tier @entity142 in the next round			1
