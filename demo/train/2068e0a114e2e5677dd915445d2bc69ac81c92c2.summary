-- we 've all heard the dictum : do n't text and drive			1
now a @entity4 state appeals court has an addendum : do n't knowingly text a driver -- or you could be held liable if he causes a crash			1
@entity9 was behind the wheel of his pickup in september 2009 driving down a rural highway when @entity13 sent him a text			1
the two were teens at the time			2
he was 18 ; she was 17 , and they were dating			2
they sent each other 62 texts that day , according to court documents			1
in the opposing lane of traffic , @entity21 was cruising along on a big , blue touring motorcycle with his wife , @entity25 , along for the ride			1
they approached @entity9 at exactly the wrong time			1
can you really be liable for texting a driver ? the texts a court summary of the times of texts and calls to and from @entity9 's cell phone reflect what happened next : the teens were having a text chat , volleying each other messages every few moments			1
seventeen seconds after @entity9 sent a text , he was calling a 911 operator			1
his truck had drifted across the double center line and hit the @entity47 head - on			1
the scene @entity9 described to the emergency operator was most certainly gruesome			1
" the collision severed , or nearly severed @entity21 's left leg			2
it shattered @entity25 's left leg , leaving her fractured thighbone protruding out of the skin as she lay injured in the road , " the court document said			2
@entity13 texted him two more times			0
the court did not publish the contents of their messages			2
film legend @entity62 takes on texting and driving the lawsuit the @entity64 both lost their legs			2
but they did n't just go after @entity9			1
they included @entity13 in the lawsuit			0
in their minds , she was distracting him and was also responsible for their pain and loss			0
they settled with @entity9 and lost against @entity13 , but they appealed that decision			1
the plaintiffs ' attorney , @entity79 , argued that the text sender was electronically in the car with the driver receiving the text and should be treated like someone sitting next to him willfully causing a distraction , legal analyst @entity78 told @entity0 affiliate @entity87			0
the argument seemed to work			0
the ruling on tuesday , three appeals court judges agreed with it -- in principle			1
they ruled that if the sender of text messages knows that the recipient is driving and texting at the same time , a court may hold the sender responsible for distraction and hold him or her liable for the accident			1
" we hold that the sender of a text message can potentially be liable if an accident is caused by texting , but only if the sender knew or had special reason to know that the recipient would view the text while driving and thus be distracted , " the court said			1
explainer : can you really be liable for texting a driver ? but the judges let @entity13 off the hook			1
she had a habit of sending more than 100 texts a day and was oblivious to whether recipients were driving or not			0
" i 'm a young teenager			0
that 's what we do , " she said in her deposition before the original trial			0
since she was unaware that @entity9 was texting while driving , she bore no responsibility , the court decided			1
" in this appeal , we must also decide whether plaintiffs have shown sufficient evidence to defeat summary judgment in favor of the remote texter			0
we conclude they have not , " it said			0
survey : adults text more than teens while driving the reaction during the trial , @entity13 , now 21 , found it " weird " that the plaintiffs tried to nail down whether she knew @entity9 was texting behind the wheel , the court document said			1
the judges ' decision has elicited a similar response from the state 's governor , @entity143			0
the driver is ultimately responsible , he said			0
not someone sending him a text			0
" you have the obligation to keep your eyes on the road , your hands on the wheel and pay attention to what you 're doing , " he told radio station @entity4 101.5			2
" that 's completely absurd , just because you know you 're driving does n't mean , it really does n't mean they know you 're looking at it , " @entity158 told @entity87			0
" even talking to the driver can distract them , so they are going to arrest for someone who simply talked to someone who is driving ? " @entity169 asked			0
the future @entity4 has been cracking down hard on texting and driving in recent years , implementing new laws and regulations that treat it in a similar manner as drunken driving if it involves an injury accident			2
the state passed a law last year based on the fate of the @entity64 and others who had been killed or maimed by texting motorists			2
the " @entity186 , @entity21 and @entity187 " makes distracted driving a crime if the driver causes an accident			0
fines for bodily injury run as high as $ 150,000 , and the driver can go to jail for up to 10 years			0
and new legislation proposed by state sen. @entity193 would let police thumb through cellphones if they have " reasonable grounds " to believe the driver was talking or texting when the wreck occurred			2
the bill has set off alarm bells with the @entity201 of @entity4			0
