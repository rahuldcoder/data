-- @entity1 has published a letter to @entity4 customers -- signed by ceo @entity5 -- that addresses the growing controversy over the company 's warranty policies there			1
posted to the @entity4 version of @entity1 's website on monday , the letter ( @entity12 translation ) discusses changes that @entity1 plans in @entity4 to offer better customer service			2
in addition to a clear statement on @entity1 's website regarding its repair and warranty policies , @entity1 also plans to increase training for its staff and authorized resellers , and plans to improve how it handles @entity26 and @entity27 repairs			0
" we are aware ... the lack of external communication in this process ... lead to the speculation that @entity1 is arrogant , does not care or does not attach importance to consumer feedback			2
we express our sincere apologies for any concerns or misunderstandings this gives consumers , " reads a @entity12 translation version of @entity5 's letter			0
the letter comes about a week after @entity4 state media began its open criticism of @entity1 and its response -- or lack thereof -- to warranty complaints			1
the @entity47 even ran a front - page piece calling @entity1 " arrogant " in dealing with @entity4 consumers , saying @entity1 ignored customers and offered sub-par customer service			1
but @entity4 is such an important market to @entity1 -- @entity5 wo n't stop talking about @entity1 's growth in @entity4 during every quarter 's fiscal call -- that it 's no surprise @entity1 issued a public response			1
it will likely take several weeks ( if not months ) for changes in consumer perceptions of @entity1 to register			0
that said , @entity1 has encouraged @entity4 consumers to get in touch with the company directly regarding issues with @entity1 retail stores or resellers			0
" [ @entity68 ] e always harbor immense respect to @entity4 , the @entity4 consumer is always the top priority of our hearts , " @entity5 wrote			0
