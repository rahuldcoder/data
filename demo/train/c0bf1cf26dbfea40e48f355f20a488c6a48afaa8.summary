@entity1 , @entity0 -- pregnant women in @entity4 are dying at scandalous rates , according to the author of an @entity8 report into maternal mortality in the @entity11 country			1
the report , " @entity13 : barriers to @entity18 in @entity4 " found that hundreds of poor , rural and indigenous pregnant women are dying because they are being denied the same health services as other women in the country			1
it also concluded that the government 's response to tackling the problem was inadequate			0
@entity4 government figures state 185 in every 100,000 women die in childbirth , but the @entity27 says the number is much higher , 240 per 100,000 , which makes it one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the @entity31			1
in wealthy developed nations , only nine women die for every 100,000 births			0
the five main causes of pregnancy - related deaths in @entity4 are hemorrhage , pre-eclampsia , infection , complications following abortion and obstructed birth , according to @entity4 's @entity44 figures			2
@entity8 's @entity4 researcher @entity45 said , in a written statement : " the rates of maternal mortality in @entity4 are scandalous			1
the fact that so many women are dying from preventable causes is a human rights violation			0
" the @entity4 state is simply ignoring its obligation to provide adequate maternal health care to all women , regardless of who they are and where they live			2
" @entity61 added : " health services for pregnant women in @entity4 are like a lottery : if you are poor and indigenous , the chances are you will always lose			1
" the report said pregnant women in @entity4 die because they lack access to emergency obstetric care , to information on maternal health , and to health staff members who can speak @entity75 languages such as @entity76 -- a native @entity78 language spoken by some 5 million people in @entity4			1
according to the report , 27 percent of deaths of women from pregnancy - related causes occurred during pregnancy ; 26 percent occurred during the birth itself ; and 46 percent during the first six weeks after giving birth			0
a 2007 @entity88 of @entity75 showed that 60 percent did not have access to a health facility , said @entity8			2
the @entity8 report notes that the @entity4 government has instituted policies aimed at reducing the rates of maternal mortality , such as increasing maternal waiting houses -- rooms where pregnant women who live far from health centers can stay			1
other measures include more training for health staff members on the vertical birth method common among indigenous women and teaching the quiche language to health professionals , @entity8 said			2
but the human rights group said @entity4 women and health professionals have complained that the measures are not being implemented effectively			2
for example , the rights group said , even though the number of waiting houses has increased more than threefold in the past eight years , only half of them are in rural areas			1
the agency also contends that training for health professionals on the vertical birth method is not sufficiently widespread			0
according to @entity4 's @entity122 ombudsperson , more than 45 percent of health staff last year said they had not received appropriate training , @entity8 said			1
" official initiatives to reduce maternal mortality are good news , " @entity61 said			1
" however , lack of clear responsibilities for implementing them and the absence of effective resourcing and monitoring puts any initiative in great jeopardy			0
" though @entity4 's rate of maternal deaths is high , it pales in comparison to @entity138 , which has about 900 deaths for each 100,000 births , the @entity27 says			1
for @entity138 as a whole , the number is 820			0
the highest rates were in @entity144 , with 2,000 , and @entity145 , with 1,900			2
@entity146 and the @entity148 average 130 deaths per 100,000 births , the @entity27 says , with the lowest rates in @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152			0
worldwide , there were an average of 400 deaths for each 100,000 births in the year 2000 , the @entity27 says			0
the lowest rates were in @entity157 , with zero , and @entity158 , with four per 100,000 births			0
the @entity160 had 11 deaths per 100,000 births in 2005 , the @entity27 says			0
@entity2 's @entity162 contributed to this report .			0
