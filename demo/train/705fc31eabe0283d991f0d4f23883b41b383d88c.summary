the 35 - year old set herself on fire at a road crossing in @entity17 , in the @entity19 region of @entity20 , the @entity13 said , citing @entity11			1
it was unclear why she killed herself , though @entity6 campaign groups say it was in protest against @entity4 rule			1
but @entity4 's @entity26 claimed the incident related to " pro-tibetan independence forces " overseas			2
" everyone knows that nowadays , except for the very few evil cults and extremist forces , all religions advocate respect for human life and oppose violence , " said spokesperson @entity29			0
" it is a challenge to the moral bottom line of all human beings if , instead of condemning the extreme act of self - immolation , some people are hyping or instigating it			0
" according to the @entity44 ( @entity44 ) , which advocates @entity6 independence , @entity46 -- @entity10 's @entity6 name -- called for freedom and the return from exile of the @entity51 , the @entity6 spiritual leader , as she was burning			1

her body was then taken by fellow nuns into the @entity60 nunnery in @entity17 , the @entity44 said			0
six of the @entity63 -- all monks or former monks -- who have set themselves ablaze died from their injuries			0
most of the suicide attempts occurred in @entity67 and the @entity68 , also in @entity20 , which has become a focal point for ethnic @entity6 angry at the erosion of their culture			2

@entity53 said @entity75 , 20 , died outside the @entity76			0
the @entity77 in @entity78 told @entity1 they were not aware of the incident			2
activists and exiled tibetans say the disturbing acts reflect an increasingly repressive environment under @entity78 's control			1
" the incidents are a clear indication of the genuine grievances of the @entity6 and their sense of deep resentment and despair over the prevailing conditions in @entity53 , " said new @entity6 leader in exile , @entity85 , in quotes carried by @entity53			2
" it is therefore of the utmost urgency that every possible effort be made to address the underlying root causes of @entity6 grievances and resentment			2
" a statement from the @entity6 government in exile in @entity103 , @entity100 read : " the @entity104 ( @entity105 ) would like to make it clear that it stands in solidarity with the @entity6 people in @entity53 who endure continued suppression under the @entity4 authorities , whose short - sighted policies have driven till now eleven @entity6 to set themselves on fire			1
" instead of addressing the real problems that drive @entity6 to commit self - immolation , @entity11 , the official news organ of the @entity4 government , blames the @entity6 - in - exile for instigating such desperate and despairing acts			1
" the @entity104 strongly urges the @entity4 government to stop hurling baseless allegations and to start solving the real problems			2
( the ) @entity4 can do this by stopping its repressive policy on @entity53 and allowing more freedom of religion and speech			2
" prominent @entity6 writer and activist @entity125 told @entity1 this kind of protest will continue as long as the @entity4 government 's @entity53 policy remains the same			1
" if there is no improvement @entity6 will feel it 's better to die than be alive			1
they commit suicide to protest , " she said			0
" the international community should impose pressure and condemn the @entity4 government , " she added			0

" in an interview with @entity1 last month , @entity125 said @entity6 @entity145 ca n't use violence against others to protest , so they harm themselves to people pay attention to their plight			0
" this is not suicide			0
this is sacrifice in order to draw the world 's attention , " she said			0
@entity4 rejects accusations of oppression of @entity6 , saying its rule has greatly improved living standards for the @entity6 people			1
the @entity51 's representative signed an agreement with @entity78 in 1951 to affirm @entity4 's sovereignty over @entity53 but also grant autonomy to the area			1
a failed uprising against @entity78 's rule in 1959 forced the @entity51 into exile			1
