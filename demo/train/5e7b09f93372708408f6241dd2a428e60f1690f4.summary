-- it was billed as a battle between @entity3 and @entity4 , two of the top footballers in the world			1
@entity3 was the clear winner as he scored the lone goal for @entity9 in a 1 - 0 victory over @entity11 in the first leg of their @entity14 playoff -- although some would argue he should have been shown a red card prior to the brave diving header			1
@entity3 met @entity19 's sumptuous cross in the 82nd minute just as it looked like he -- and his teammates -- would have to settle for a draw in @entity23			1
the tie , however , is still in the balance after @entity3 missed another good chance , striking the crossbar in the 86th minute with a further header			1
" it was an important step to reach the @entity14 but not yet decisive , " @entity9 manager @entity29 told reporters			1
earlier in the second half , @entity3 appeared to headbutt @entity34 defender @entity33			2
@entity36 referee @entity35 opted not to punish the @entity38 star but later showed him a yellow card for clipping @entity34 keeper @entity40			0
@entity4 was silenced but will be looking forward to the return leg in @entity11 on tuesday			2
@entity42 faces an uphill climb to reach the @entity44 , meanwhile , after losing 2 - 0 to @entity45 and @entity46 is almost in @entity47 following a 3 - 1 win over @entity49			1
in the lone other @entity54 playoff , @entity50 -- bidding to become the smallest nation , in population , to reach a @entity14 -- hung on for a 0 - 0 draw against @entity56 despite being reduced to 10 men			1
in @entity23 , the start was far from cautious			0
in the fifth minute , @entity59 ' through ball picked out @entity61 and he did well to round the keeper			0
but his shot from a tight angle went wide			0
@entity11 almost took the lead on its best opportunity of the evening			2
@entity33 's teasing cross found its way into the box and @entity71 's diving flick sailed inches wide			0
the @entity34 built on their early superiority -- @entity74 's shot stung the palms of @entity76 and @entity78 's fiercely struck free kick from a yard outside the box flashed wide of @entity76 's post			0
@entity9 , though , dominated possession in the second half and the @entity34 were left to defend			2
in the 50th minute , @entity84 and @entity85 caused havoc in the @entity34 box and 12 minutes later only a great block prevented a certain @entity9 goal			1
@entity11 's resistance was finally broken courtesy of @entity3			1
" we played a good game defensively , " said @entity34 boss @entity92			0
" the goal was unnecessary			0
we were careless with that cross			0
" @entity42 stutters @entity42 last missed a major tournament in 1994 and must mount a comeback tuesday at the @entity42 to keep the streak alive			2
the visitor rarely threatened and @entity45 took the lead when @entity103 's effort eluded @entity104 -- who returned to action after suffering a head injury while playing for club side @entity107 two weeks ago -- in the 61st minute			2
@entity108 brought down the impressive @entity103 for a penalty that @entity110 converted in the 82nd minute and the @entity112 defender later saw red as he tangled with @entity113			0
just last summer , @entity42 beat @entity45 on the road at @entity115			1
" it 's obviously a very bad result , " @entity42 manager @entity116 told @entity118 television			2
" we have to believe ( we can advance ) but @entity45 are the team in the best position to qualify			0
" @entity50 -- population 320,000 -- has never appeared at a @entity14 or @entity125 but kept its composure in @entity127 even with defender @entity129 's straight red card in the 50th minute and the loss of talisman @entity131 due to injury			1
" to defend for almost 45 minutes with one less man on the pitch , i ca n't describe in words what these players have done , " @entity50 manager @entity133 told @entity135 television			0
two goals from @entity142 in @entity143 gave @entity46 a sizable advantage versus @entity49 , which saw red , too , when substitute @entity145 was sent off in stoppage time			0
stalemate in @entity147 in the highest - profile friendly friday , @entity148 and @entity149 played to an ill tempered 1 - 1 tie in @entity147			1
the @entity152 -- defeated by @entity148 in the knockout stages at @entity115 -- dominated the opening exchanges and pressed home their advantage through defender @entity157 ' eighth - minute goal			1
@entity158 subsequently netted his first goal for the national team midway in the first half			0
when @entity163 and @entity164 missed for @entity149 near the end , it extended the team 's winless run against @entity148			1
not since 1995 has @entity149 downed the @entity148			1
the game finished on a sour note , following a clash between @entity149 's @entity171 and @entity36 defender @entity172			2
@entity173 , which benched keeper @entity174 , fell 2 - 0 to @entity175			1
@entity177 forward @entity176 scored both goals for @entity175 as the @entity180 side cut open the @entity173 ' defense at @entity182			0
@entity173 must regroup tuesday when it faces @entity149 .			0

@entity3 's goal gave @entity9 a 1 - 0 win over @entity11 in their @entity14 playoff
@entity42 is in *danger* of missing @entity47 2014 after losing 2 - 0 in @entity45 in another playoff
@entity50 hung on for a 0 - 0 draw against @entity56 despite being reduced to 10 men
in friday 's *glamor* friendly , @entity148 *rallied* for a 1 - 1 tie at home against @entity149
