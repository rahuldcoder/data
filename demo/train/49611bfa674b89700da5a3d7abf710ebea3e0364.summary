( the film has already pulled in a total of $ 573 million worldwide			0
) catching @entity6 set a new record for both the 3 - day and 5 - day @entity3 weekend , surpassing @entity16 , which grossed $ 57.5 million / $ 82.4 million in 2001			1
@entity18 's $ 130 million sequel is now on track to easily outgross @entity5 ' $ 408 million domestic total			2

that number easily trumped @entity24 's last animated princess film , tangled , which grossed $ 68.1 million over its five - day @entity3 debut			2
@entity28 scored with audiences , earning an " @entity33 " @entity34 , which will help it earn back its $ 150 million budget ( and much , much more ) in no time			2
it 's not common that two films ever play as well simultaneously as @entity28 and @entity27 did this weekend			1
who said women are n't box office draws ? @entity41 : @entity42 held onto third place with $ 15.5 million over the extended frame and $ 11.1 million for the weekend			1

@entity57 's latest vehicle homefront nabbed the fifth place slot with a $ 9.8 million five - day start			1
the film pulled in just $ 7 million over the typical weekend , and it joins @entity57 's long list of middling box office performers			2
still , @entity63 , distributed by open @entity64 , only cost $ 22 million to produce and it fared much better than fellow newcomer @entity65 , which finished outside the @entity67 with just $ 5 million since wednesday			0
the $ 17.5 million film stars @entity69 , @entity70 , and @entity71 , but audiences were n't inspired to check it out			0

frozen -- $ 93.0 million 3			0
@entity41 : @entity42 -- $ 15.5 million 4			1
@entity48 -- $ 11.1 million 5			0

@entity82 's @entity81 grossed a middling $ 6.4 million in five days after expanding into 1,234 theaters			0
meanwhile , @entity85 's @entity84 found just $ 4.6 million in the same period of time from 835 theaters			2
