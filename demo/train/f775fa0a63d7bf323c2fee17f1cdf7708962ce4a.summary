@entity1 's most valuable export ? oil			0
its most problematic ? @entity4			1
you know it 's going to be a strange week when the hashtag # @entity7			0
guess what ? nineteen - year - old singer and teen heartthrob @entity4 -- who was arrested this week in @entity12 for street racing in a $ 250,000 @entity14 while under the influence of alcohol and drugs , driving without a valid license , and resisting arrest -- is not a @entity21 citizen			1
rather , @entity4 is a citizen of his native @entity1			1
@entity4 is in the @entity21 on an o - 1 work visa that was designed to retain foreigners with " extraordinary ability in the sciences , arts , education , business or athletics			1
" what @entity4 has is an extraordinary knack for getting into trouble			1
far away from @entity12 , the @entity34 is investigating whether @entity4 was involved in an egging of his neighbor 's home in a gated community in @entity39 , @entity40			1
while other teenage celebrities might aspire to be crowned " @entity42 , " @entity4 -- given his childish , narcissistic and self - destructive antics -- seems to be angling for a more dubious title : " @entity21 's brat			1
" @entity4 is n't known for doing smart things , but the one smart thing that @entity48 did is what the rich and spoiled often do when they land in jail in @entity52			1
@entity4 's manager hired @entity54 , the @entity12 - based celebrity defense lawyer who is as skilled in front of a television camera as in front of a jury			1
@entity54 said this week that he hoped the case against @entity4 would proceed " as any other case would			1
really ? if this case had proceeded like any other -- or at least , like many others -- your client might be in @entity66 by now			0
the immigration enforcement apparatus does not look favorably upon non- @entity21 citizen foreigners who commit crimes and get arrested			1
you can have a green card or a visa that allows you to live in the @entity21 legally while you work or study , and you can still get deported if you get crossways with the law			2
think of it this way : the @entity21 government grants permission to some people to stay in this country , and it can revoke it , too			2
it happens every day , especially here in the @entity82 and along the @entity21 - @entity89 border , for crimes ranging from shoplifting to drunk driving to selling ice cream without a permit			1
@entity21 either do n't hear about these cases , or they do n't care because the person being removed from the country is n't rich and famous			1
of course , @entity4 has n't been convicted of anything yet			1
in fact , according to published reports relying on a source close to the investigation , @entity4 's blood - alcohol level was below 0.08 % in two breath tests administered by authorities			1
the 0.08 % mark is the legal limit for most drivers in @entity52			0
for drivers under 21 , the state has a lower threshold for proving one is intoxicated : 0.02 %			0
a source told @entity108 that @entity4 blew .011 % and .014 % in the two @entity110 tests			2
however , police say @entity4 admitted to them that he had been drinking , using marijuana and taking prescription pills			2
the point is that , in many cases , when dealing with foreigners who find themselves in police custody , we would n't even have gotten this far			0
again , back in the real world of law enforcement , there are police stations -- for instance , in @entity40 -- that allow federal immigration agents to sit at a desk in the squad room			0
and when a police officer walks in with a suspect in handcuffs who looks like he might just be undocumented ( read : " @entity89 " ) , the catch of the day gets passed on to the immigration agent before he is even fingerprinted			0
so there 's no record of the transaction			0
and if the agent determines that the person in custody is in the country illegally , he takes possession and immediately transports him to a nearby @entity144 substation to begin deportation proceedings			0
it 's all very efficient , and journalists like me would n't even know it was happening if we did n't have helpful sources within police departments telling us that it 's happening			2
in @entity4 's case , he was not handed over to immigration agents and hustled out the back door of the police department to begin deportation proceedings			1
instead , @entity4 was released from jail after he made a brief appearance through a video link before a @entity12 judge , who set a " standard " $ 2,500 bond			2
@entity4 has an estimated net worth of about $ 130 million			2
i bet that , right about now , many of those @entity89 immigrants who were deported because they came to the attention of local police officers for a burned - out taillight , or for not making a complete stop at an intersection , are wishing that they had been a rich , white kid with marginal music ability and too much money			0
if so , things might have gone differently for them			0
meanwhile , @entity179 seems to be getting ready to debate how to fix the immigration system			0
the major question will be what to do with the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants living in the @entity21			2
but along the way , lawmakers must also revisit and revamp the unfair o - 1 work visa program			0
there is enough favoritism in the immigration system as it is			0
if people come from certain countries or have certain skills , they 're more likely to get in			0
we do n't need more of that brand of preferential treatment for singers , actors or ice skaters			0
just like we do n't need a certain @entity1 import			0
if @entity4 is convicted of the alleged crimes in @entity52 , he should get what many other foreigners have already received for less serious infractions : a one - way ticket out of the country .			1

@entity4 was arrested for racing under the influence of drugs , alcohol
@entity213 : @entity4 has an extraordinary knack for getting into trouble
he says @entity4 's star status does n't mean he should get special treatment
@entity213 : if @entity4 is convicted , he should get a one - way ticket out of @entity21
