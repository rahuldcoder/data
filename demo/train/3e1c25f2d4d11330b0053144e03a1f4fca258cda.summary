-- @entity1 is n't annoyed when @entity2 gets so bogged down with traffic that he ca n't post a message			1
@entity2 's " fail whale , " which appears when the site is overrun , is so popular it 's on t - shirts and even tattoos			1
that 's because in the moment when frustration would hit , he 's greeted on the popular web site by a cartoonish image he loves : a giant whale being lifted out of an ocean by a small flock of tweeting birds			1
the icon -- which @entity2 users call it the " fail whale " because the creature appears only when the site has failed to load -- has gained a cult following as the social media site grows at breakneck pace			1
the conversational web site , which lets users post 140 - character microblogs , saw a 1,374 percent jump in unique visitors between february 2008 and february this year , up to 7 million from only 475,000 , according to @entity33			1
by comparison , @entity34 grew 228 percent , to 65.7 million users , during the same period			2
with all of those new @entity37 , fail whale sightings and site crashes seem more frequent			1
@entity1 ( mr_bill on @entity2 ) and other fail - whale followers are n't bothered , though			1
the 36 - year - old @entity41 has organized parties in honor of the whale			1
the most recent , held in @entity45 in february , was attended by more than 300 people , including @entity47 , the artist in @entity48 who created the image			2
@entity1 says the whale represents a contrarian philosophy			0
" it 's sort of an adorable whale but also this thing that represents the herculean tasks that we sometimes go about from day to day , " he said			2
" we 're all trying to do a lot of things that seem pretty impossible , " @entity1 said			0
" it 's nice to identify something positive with those failures			0
" not every twitterer is sympathetic to the site 's troubles , though			1
some users say @entity2 has outgrown its core audience and is irrelevant to the technophiles who made it popular in the first place			1
others are annoyed by the flood of spammers and profiteers who now use the site 's popularity to make a buck			1
celebrities and members of @entity83 have been jumping onto the site in recent months , adding to the site 's mainstream popularity and , some users say , causing glitches in the system			1
" i keep getting the fail whale			1
@entity2 got too popular too quickly			0
i blame @entity94 , " wrote @entity91 , a 21 - year - old @entity92 student who goes by suchamessica on @entity2			2
basketball player @entity94 , or @entity94 , has more than 470,000 followers on the site			0
@entity97 , a blogger whose article " can @entity2 survive what is about to happen to it ? " has been passed around the site , said a rift is developing between @entity2 's original " in crowd " and its newer , more mainstream users			1
early adopters find many of the new users annoying , he said			0
" a lot of people come in , and they take that ' what are you doing ? ' question literally , and so they put very inane things on @entity2 , " he said			0
ireport.com : how do you feel about tweets and status updates ? the site used to feel " insulated " from the mainstream , and now it does n't , he said			0
but for all the complaints , there seem to be just as many people who are almost excited about @entity2 's growing pains			2
it is inevitable that a web site seeing @entity2 - style growth would face some glitches and a backlash from early adopters , said @entity126 , a consultant and co-author of the book " @entity2			1
" " there 's going to be all kinds of people using it all kinds of different ways , " she said			0
" the purists can go pound rocks			0
" major news such as the @entity139 terrorist attacks and the @entity141 plane landing has broken over @entity2 , and that 's added to the site 's popularity , she said			1
@entity145 , who writes on social media at @entity147 , said the backlash against @entity2 stems from the fact that people are uncomfortable with change			2
early users see new people coming to the site , and that creeps them out , but it should n't , she said			1
" @entity157 is freaking good , " she said			0
" as the site gets filled with fresh users , people are creating pieces of software to help @entity164 sort through the noise , @entity145 said			0
she said @entity2 is popular because it mimics real - life conversation and because it 's easy to use			2
she also expects @entity2 to expand , especially as people in developing countries use cell - phone text messages to communicate through the site			2
that 's what we do , " she said			0
" we 're social creatures			0
we 're kind of wired for this			0
" @entity2 says it is addressing breakdowns in that wired communication			0
" we have made amazing progress from a technical perspective as far as accommodating this rapid growth goes and will continue to improve system and subsystem performance moving forward , " @entity2 co-founder @entity177 wrote in a statement to @entity0			2
@entity184 of @entity185 , @entity186 , believes so much in the site 's ability to overcome adversity that he recently got a tattoo of the fail whale on his leg			1
" the site itself has suffered a few scrapes and bumps along the way , but for the most part , i definitely think it 's a good thing , " said the 36 - year - old			2
the fail whale 's account on @entity2 has more than 2,265 followers			1
a @entity34 group dedicated to the whale has more than 4,400 members			0
the whale has spawned art and merchandise , from coffee mugs to baby clothes			0
a @entity213 parody of the whale has spun around the @entity215 , too			0
@entity1 , whose fail whale parties have featured an aquamarine martini in honor of the icon 's color , said the whale 's popularity comes from the idea that failures are worth celebrating and learning from			1
@entity2 will use that philosophy to continue to grow , he said			0
" @entity2 is a powerful enough thing that it should succeed in a broad way , and i would like it to succeed in a broad way , " he said .			0

@entity2 saw growth of more than 1,300 percent in the year up to february
its *swift* growth has caused a backlash among some of the site 's early users
other rally around the " fail whale , " an icon of the site 's *shortcomings*
site users host parties in honor of the whale ; one even has a tattoo of the image
