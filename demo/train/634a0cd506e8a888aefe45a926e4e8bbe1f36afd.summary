@entity0 -- @entity3 prime minister @entity2 , who has stopped well short of agreeing to a continued freeze on building @entity3 settlements in the @entity6 , made comments that suggested that he might be willing to compromise on the issue			1
construction of settlements is a major sticking point between @entity3 and the @entity12 , which recently resumed direct peace talks for the first time since 2008			1
" the @entity20 are demanding that after the 26th of september there will be zero growth in the @entity6 , and that wo n't happen , " @entity2 said during a sunday meeting with @entity17 representative @entity16 , a diplomatic source briefed on the discussions told @entity1			1
the quartet consists of the @entity25 , @entity26 , the @entity27 and the @entity28			0
" @entity3 will not be able to continue with the moratorium , " @entity2 said			1
" on one hand , we wo n't be building all the tens of thousands of housing units that are waiting in the pipeline , but on the other hand we wo n't be freezing the lives of the inhabitants of the @entity6 when we wo n't freeze the building			1
" " i do n't know if there will be a comprehensive freeze , " @entity2 said at a sunday @entity40 meeting , according to the @entity3 newspaper @entity41			1
" but i also do n't know if it is necessary to construct all of the 20,000 housing units waiting to be built			2
in any case , between zero and one there are a lot of possibilities			0
" last year , @entity3 instituted a 10 - month moratorium on building @entity3 settlements in the @entity6			1
@entity2 is under pressure from the @entity20 and the from the administration of @entity25 president @entity54 to extend the freeze , which is currently set to expire toward the end of september			2
@entity2 's conservative coalition government wants the prime minister to end the moratorium			2
an @entity3 settlement watch organization called @entity59 says groundwork construction already is complete on 2,000 @entity3 housing units in the @entity6 , on which building could resume as soon as the moratorium ends			1

@entity12 president @entity67 and @entity68 in @entity69 for direct talks earlier this month			0

@entity2 said that if all sides are serious in their efforts , it would be possible to arrive at a framework for lasting peace within the year			0
" just as we are asked to recognize the @entity12 national state ... we also demand and expect the @entity20 to recognize a @entity88 state , the @entity3 , as the national state of the jewish people			0
this is the true foundation of peace , " he said , according to @entity41			0
@entity12 negotiators have said they will walk away from peace talks if @entity3 resumes settlement construction in the @entity6			1
