-- it sounds like the plot from an old movie : airline crew members make this passenger announcement , " is anyone on board a pilot ? " that was the situation last december when @entity11 capt. @entity10 and his wife and daughter were traveling from @entity14 to @entity15 aboard a @entity17 @entity16			1
" i looked at my wife and she looked back at me and she said , ' i think you should ring the call button , ' " @entity10 told @entity0 on tuesday			2
@entity10 , who pilots @entity22 bombers , already could tell something was wrong			2
flight attendants were rushing to the front of the aircraft			2
one was carrying a first - aid kit			2
when @entity10 reached the cockpit , it was clear the captain was in trouble			2
passengers and crew were helping him out of the cockpit			2
a cot had been set up			0
the captain looked pale and clammy from an apparent heart attack , @entity10 remembered			0
@entity10 stepped onto the flight deck and came eye to eye with the first officer			1
" there was a moment , " he recalled			0
" we both had about five seconds to size each other up			0
she was wondering about my level of experience			0
was i a @entity52 driver -- or a professional pilot ? " i wanted to make sure she was ok			1
i had a feeling she was -- she was better than ok			0
she had already made the decision to turn the plane toward the nearest airport			1
" @entity10 strapped himself in and did what he could to help get the plane to the airport in @entity63			1
never taking the controls , @entity10 acted as a backup for the first officer			1
he worked the radio , communicating with air traffic controllers -- updating them on the condition of the captain , passengers and the aircraft			1
although he never suspected he would have to fly the plane , piloting a @entity22 bomber is n't too different from a 737 , @entity10 explained			1
" a plane is a plane , " he said			1
" it 's like the difference between driving a pickup truck , or a sedan			0
" after landing , the airliner taxied as near a terminal gate as possible -- and ground crew maneuvered a rolling stairway to one of the plane 's exits			1
the captain was rushed by ambulance for treatment			0
after @entity10 and his family got off the aircraft , they simply " slinked out the back door , " with the @entity11 pilot feeling confident he 'd done all he could to help			1
@entity10 's story never surfaced until recently , when the @entity11 received requests from news reporters			1
later @entity10 received some good news : the captain had survived -- and recovered			0
" the captain called me up a month or two later , " @entity10 remembered			0
" he said it was a really rotten event , but fortunately a lot of things fell into place			0
" and what did @entity10 's wife say after this memorable flight ? " she said , ' good job , ' " @entity10 laughed			0
" she 's a woman of few words			0
she was happy that i was there			0
