-- although @entity4 's primary @entity3 initiative has been conquering childhood obesity , the first lady is focusing on a new area during her first official trip to @entity8 : studying abroad			1
@entity4 , who landed in @entity8 on wednesday , is there to emphasize the importance of students learning from one another 's cultures			1
she is making a week - long trip to visit children at several schools in three @entity8 cities			1
the first lady took time in @entity18 to answer viewer - submitted questions about studying abroad in an exclusive @entity20			1
more than 350 questions were submitted to @entity22 from students , parents and avid travelers			1
several great questions made it into the final video interview , but for the questions that did n't make the cut , here is the transcript of the first lady 's responses			1
the interview has been edited for clarity and brevity			2

what is your most memorable cultural and travel experience ? -- @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 @entity4 : i 'm blessed to have so many phenomenal cultural experiences , everything from traveling to so many parts of @entity51 to meeting with the @entity52 at the @entity53 to being here at @entity55			1
everywhere i go , i 'm always struck by the reality that we have so much more in common throughout the world , regardless of where we 're born , our race , our religious beliefs			0
we 're all striving for the best for our communities and for our families			0
this is why study abroad is so important			1
the more young people get the opportunity to travel the world , live in other cultures and learn new languages , the more they will begin to understand our shared ideals and the shared opportunities to keep moving this world forward			2
studying abroad could give you an edge in the job market how can we , as students , help push our fellow students and the next generation abroad ? how can we help you in your efforts to make the @entity83 a more worldly and open - minded nation ? -- @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 @entity4 : i think so many people in your generation already get it in ways that people in my generation did n't get it			1
one thing i shared during my speech here in @entity18 ( @entity55 ) was that when i was in college , i never took advantage of the opportunities to study abroad			2
some of it was because i was afraid			0
some of it was because i did n't know what opportunities existed			0
some of it was because i though the best thing i could do was finish my degree , get out there in the world and make money as fast as i could			0
but now , more and more young people are coming to college with a broader sensibility			0
i think that has a lot to do with the fact that people have access to the @entity120			0
you guys are seeing the world through eyes that i never had access to when i was your age			0
i would just encourage you to continue to be a voice for the importance of travel and stepping outside of your comfort zones to the extent that you 're mentoring other young people where you 're from , going to schools , encouraging young people to learn new languages and not be afraid to try new things , even if it 's as simple as going to another community and trying a different kind of food			1
we live in the @entity83 , where there 's almost every culture , every language you can imagine right here on our soil			2
we can start by experiencing the diversity in our own communities			0
one good way to do that is through service to the community			0
but i have the utmost of confidence in your generation			0
you guys are already making me and my husband very proud			0
just keep up the great work			0
what lasting benefit does study abroad have on students once they return to the @entity83 ? -- @entity165 , @entity166 @entity4 : the benefits of study abroad are almost endless			1
first of all , it 's going to make you much more marketable here in the @entity83 , because more and more companies are realizing that they need people with experiences around the world , who can speak different languages , who can transition easily into other cultures and people who bring to their jobs a sensibility and a sensitivity for other people			1
it will also make you more compassionate			0
we could always use more compassionate , young leaders out there in the world , people who are willing to step outside their comfort zones and be open to wiping away misconceptions			0
especially for @entity83 students , it 's very hard to stay in your comfort zone when you 're living in another country			2
when you 're struggling with a language , new foods , learning directions , being forced to make friends and do things that you would n't normally do , that 's going to set you up for a lifetime of value			1
it 's going to make you a better parent			2
it 's going to make you a better human being			2
i want more young people like you to take that step			0
try something new , travel abroad , and if you ca n't travel abroad , use the @entity120 to see the world			2
how can we make foreign exchange opportunities available for all students and not just the affluent ? -- @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity223 @entity4 : great question , and thanks for your work teaching our kids			1
making sure that all of our kids in the @entity83 have access to opportunities to study abroad , regardless of their race or socioeconomic background , is going to be critical for us			2
one of the things that the president has done by promoting 100,000 strong is work in partnership with institutions in the @entity83 and abroad , and with @entity83 companies , to increase the opportunities for more young people to study abroad , regardless of where they 're from			2
one of the things that he and i talk about is the shared connection that we gain when we have educational exchange opportunities between countries that are enhanced by ensuring that the folks who represent the @entity83 , represent all of the @entity83			0
kids like me , who grew up in a working - class background , grew up in a tiny apartment and went to public schools , there 's a perspective that i uniquely have to share with the rest of the world			1
and the same is true for a kid growing up in a rural @entity8 or a kid who is a studying in @entity268			1
they need to have opportunities to travel the world because they are going to be our future leaders , and their voices are one that we have to hear as we continue to develop this world and continue to tackle the challenges that we will inevitably face			0
diversity is key , and we will continue to do all that we can here in this administration to continue to lift up opportunities and make them accessible for all of our young people			0
how do we get parents to be comfortable with the idea of their children studying abroad and supporting them in this endeavor ? -- @entity289 of @entity290 , @entity291 @entity4 : getting parents on board when it comes to studying abroad is key			1
we all as parents want the best for our kids , but sometimes it 's a little hard to let them out of the nest			2
one of the things that we really need to do is to provide more information for parents so they have an understanding why study abroad is important , how it 's going to expand the opportunities for their loved ones and how are they going to be able to afford it			1
oftentimes that is a key deterrent for many families who do n't have the resources they need to understand what the economic impact will be on their families and on their kids			0
they also need to understand more about an ever - globalizing economy and that traveling abroad is no longer just a nice thing to do ; it 's becoming more and more a central part of a student 's educational experience			1
we need people like you , who have had the experience , to be spokespeople , talk about it in your churches and your communities , and the more people hear about these opportunities , the more parents will become comfortable with letting their kids go .			0
