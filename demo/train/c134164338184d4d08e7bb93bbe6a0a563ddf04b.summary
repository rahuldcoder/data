-- @entity1 was known as ' @entity2 ' -- but there 's one man who 's determined to take a large bite out of his stage victories record			1
that man is @entity8 -- the man who won wednesday 's fifth stage of the @entity11 and took his tally of wins to 24 to move to within 10 of record holder @entity1			1
@entity1 , a five - time winner of the @entity11 , won six stages in 1969 and 1972 , and eight in 1970 and 1974 during an illustrious career			1
he achieved the treble feat of winning the @entity19 , @entity11 and @entity20 in 1974 -- one of only two men to have done so			0
but his @entity11 record is under threat with @entity25 rider @entity8 quickly becoming a serious challenger			2
@entity8 came home just ahead of @entity29 's @entity28 and @entity31 's @entity30 in wednesday 's crash affected race			2
the @entity35 rider , who won five stages at the @entity19 looked in ominous form , despite suffering from a chest infection			2
" i 'm still not 100 % after being ill last week , " he told reporters			0
" but it 's good to get the account open here at the @entity11			0
the morale is good in the team and the only way to make it better is by winning more stages			0
" @entity49 's @entity48 retained the leader 's yellow jersey following the 228.5 kilometer stretch -- the second longest stage of the @entity11			1
the @entity55 man was pleased with his day 's work -- despite teammate and main sprinter @entity58 being held up by a crash 12 km from the finish			0
" today we had two objectives , " @entity48 told reporters			0
" to try and win the stage and keep the yellow jersey within the team			1
" @entity58 got distanced on the final climb but i still have the yellow jersey on my shoulders and i managed to stay up the front and stay out of trouble			1

@entity8 won the fifth stage of the @entity74
@entity8 has now won 24 stages -- 10 fewer than record holder @entity1
@entity49 's @entity48 retained yellow jersey
