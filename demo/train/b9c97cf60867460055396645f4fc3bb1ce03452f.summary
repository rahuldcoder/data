@entity0 -- @entity2 took the stage at @entity4 on tuesday night for a discussion on the 2008 presidential election , but members of the audience may have had something else on their minds entirely			1
@entity2 admitted in august that he had an affair with @entity12 in 2006			1
after all , this is the former @entity15 senator 's first public appearance since his admission of an extramarital affair sent shockwaves through the political world more than three months ago			1
@entity2 talked about politics , poverty and his hopes for @entity22 and the world , according to @entity24			1
afterward , he answered only written questions that had been submitted before his speech			0
the affair was n't mentioned , @entity24 reported			2
the revelation , confirming a months - long investigation by the @entity30 , was a political bombshell for the former candidate , who espoused moral values during his @entity35 bid and whose wife is fighting a public battle with breast cancer			1
the acknowledgment , during an @entity41 interview in early august , was carefully timed to coincide with the opening night of the @entity43 for minimum impact , and @entity2 effectively went into hiding immediately after			1
during the interview , @entity2 said he had engaged in an extramarital affair with a former campaign staffer , @entity12 , but he vehemently denied he was the father of her newborn baby			1
the man who had been considered a major contender for the @entity52 nomination instantly became a pariah in his own party and did n't merit so much as a mention at the @entity56 a month later			0
but with the 2008 presidential election officially in the history books , @entity2 may be looking to accomplish what a handful of other national political figures have been able to do : successfully re-emerge from an embarrassing public scandal that by all appearances has left his political career in ruins			1
it remains unclear how successful the 2004 vice-presidential nominee will be in that pursuit , but @entity22 have given politicians second chances in the past			2
political opponents and members of the media have written off @entity75 on more than one occasion after embarrassing sex scandals , and many assumed @entity81 sen. @entity80 's career was done after his involvement with a @entity0 escort last year			2
" it 's possible that so many officeholders have survived sexual scandals simply because the public has a low opinion of politicians , " @entity1 polling director @entity84 said			0
" they may not be surprised that politicians are cheating on their spouses and may be more likely to forgive behavior that they assume is happening anyway			0
" but for every politician that has survived a sex scandal , scores of once - powerful men have not			0
just ask former @entity52 presidential candidate @entity101 , former @entity102 rep. @entity102 , or @entity52 rep. @entity103 , who lost his re-election bid last week after an affair with a former staffer was disclosed			1
but @entity2 ' future just may hinge on how he goes about re-entering the public sphere			2
while it remains a long shot that @entity2 will ever run for office again , he could re-emerge as a powerful voice for a set of issues he championed during the @entity52 presidential primary : poverty and healthcare			1
" he needs to figure out what the @entity52 needs post-obama election and step back and think , ' well , what can i bring to the table ? ' " said @entity118 , a professor at @entity120 's @entity119			0
" it ca n't be all about him and his resurrection			0
it has to be about the benefits he can bring to helping the new administration and what he can do to help @entity131 and his team get the job done			0
" " @entity22 are very forgiving , and their memory is often short , " @entity118 said			1
" he can come back if he does it right			0
" the speech tuesday night appears designed not to make a political splash -- no reporters or cameras are allowed in the room			1
but by all outward appearances , it is an attempt by @entity2 to dip his foot back into the political waters after a three - month hiatus			2
" whatever he says , his speech is either going to be blogged or taped by people listening , " @entity118 said			0
" social media technologies are such today that nothing is closed			0
anytime you give a speech it 's public			0
" @entity2 is also set to make a public appearance in @entity156 , @entity157 , wednesday -- and slated to debate former @entity159 strategist @entity158 at the @entity160 , the @entity154 reported over the weekend			1
but even as @entity2 is appearing to take the first steps toward a comeback , former supporters -- many of whom where blindsided by his admission of infidelity -- may be unwilling to give him a second chance this soon			2
" i wish he would keep himself locked in a cave for a year , " a former senior staffer to @entity2 ' campaign said			2
" the best strategy he could adopt right now is to stay below the radar and just be quiet and let people move on			0
" " part of him wants to champion causes others have left behind , and there is a part of him that feels like his own personal mistakes should not sabotage the causes of poverty , but he is not the best messenger for that right now , " the former senior staffer said .			0
