-- decisive , confident , disciplined , straight - forward and intelligent			0
these are just a few of the mostly glowing words the @entity3 apparently had for @entity4 in 1975 , according to an alleged cable that @entity6 published monday			1
dated february 16 , 1975 , the cable attempts to explain this new rising star on @entity10 's political scene			1
at the time , @entity4 had just won control of the country 's conservative party			2
she became prime minister in 1979 -- the only woman to hold the job			1
@entity4 died monday at age 87			1
the cable is available along with a trove of others searchable on a massive database that @entity6 claims contains other @entity24 documents			1
several years ago , @entity6 became famous worldwide for publishing sensitive @entity24 documents related to the @entity27 and @entity28 wars			0
@entity0 can not authenticate material on the database or the @entity4 cable itself			1
@entity3 spokesman @entity33 would not comment on it monday			1
as it appears in digital form on @entity6 ' site , the cable says @entity4 " blazed into national prominence almost literally from out of nowhere " and that her ascent was remarkable because she then had " narrow range of prior experience			1
" but @entity4 had captivated the public , the cable suggests , and was the " focus of intensive media and popular interest			1
" " there is general agreement among friends and critics alike that she is an effective and forceful parliamentary performer , " the cable reads			0
" she has a quick , if not profound , mind and works hard to master the most complicated brief			2
she fights her corner with skill and toughness , but can be flexible when pressed			0
" in dealing with the media or with subordinates , she tends to be crisp and a trifle patronizing			0
with colleagues , she is honest and straight - forward , if not excessively considerate of their vanities			0
" read the full cable the cable goes on to remark that @entity4 abides by the " courage of her convictions , and once she has reached a decision to act , is unlikely to be deflected by any but the most persuasive arguments			2
" she was , the cable adds , " the personification of a @entity10 middle class dream come true			2
" " the daughter of a grocer , she had by dint her own abilities and application won through , securing scholarships to good schools , making a success of her chosen career , and marrying advantageously			0
" the @entity10 leader had " conventional and somewhat forced charm , and above all her plummy voice stamp her as the quintessential suburban matron , and frighteningly @entity90 to boot			0
" the cable predicts what the future holds for @entity4			2
" if she is ever to become @entity10 's first woman prime minister , she must ... humanize her public image and broaden the base of her party 's appeal , " it says			1
" the odds are against her , but after her stunning organizational coup d'etat this past month , few are prepared to say she ca n't do it			0
" @entity0 's @entity106 contributed to this report .			0
