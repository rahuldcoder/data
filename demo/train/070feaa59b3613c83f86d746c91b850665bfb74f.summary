@entity0 -- a horse is a horse , of course , of course			2
that is , of course , unless that dancing horse belongs to the famous @entity9 family			2
@entity10 : what 's dressage ? @entity13 , the dressage horse co-owned by @entity15 , the wife of @entity16 presidential candidate @entity9 , competed thursday and will continue competition on friday at the @entity18 ; the horse is in 13th place after thursday 's competition			1
@entity15 began riding horses when she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1998 and has said the sport has helped lessen the symptoms of the inflammatory disease			1
@entity27 turns ( almost ) literal in @entity28 still , the @entity30 ' participation in the pricey prancing pony sport is causing conservatives consternation and liberals laughing fits			0
both say the fussy filly is yet more proof that @entity9 , whose net worth is nearly $ 250 million , is out of touch with average voters			0
" it fits into the narrative the @entity44 are trying to put forward that he is wealthy and out of touch with the typical @entity47 , " said @entity40 , a political science professor at the @entity41			2
the liberal group @entity48 pokes fun at the elegant equine in a 30 - second television spot set to air in the battleground states of @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 and supported by a total ad buy of five figures			1
looking a dressage horse in the mouth the ad is told from the perspective of the horse			1
" my name 's @entity13 , the @entity30 ' dressage horse , " the ad begins			1
@entity48 uses a poorly executed @entity68 accent as the voice of the @entity30 ' horse			1
" you might have seen me execute ' leg yields ' and ' flying changes , ' " the ad continues , using terms from the sport of dressage			1
" how do i pull off such grace and athleticism while looking so good ? maybe it 's because the @entity30 spend $ 77,000 per year on my upkeep			2
" the ad comes to a grim conclusion , stating : " after @entity9 repeals health care and ships your jobs overseas , i daresay your life wo n't be nearly as pampered as mine			2
after all , you 're not one of his horses			0
" what @entity9 could learn from dressage in mid-july , the @entity94 briefly used video of the @entity30 ' @entity97 - bound horse to portray the candidate as " dancing around the issues , " but later discontinued using @entity13 because it could be seen as offensive to the @entity16 candidate 's wife			1
@entity94 to stop using @entity9 horse in attack videos such cheap shots reflect ignorance about the sport , said @entity107 , executive director of the @entity108			0
" it 's a bit misleading that the sport is as expensive or as elitist as people have made it out to be , " @entity107 said			1
" it does n't necessarily reflect on the entire sport			0
" still , conservatives are mortified at what they see as the poor political strategy of having a horse participate in something that , according to the @entity108 , can cost upwards of $ 50,000 to compete at such a high level			2
" i 'm not sure why the horse has to be in the most upper - class hoity - toity @entity97 event ever invented , " conservative commentator @entity123 said on @entity124 recently			1
" during the campaign , @entity9 has struggled to shake the image of a disconnected multimillionaire			0
comments about @entity134 - owning friends and asides on owning more than one @entity136 certainly do n't help matters , political experts say			0
@entity9 calls billionaire football team owners friends in a @entity144 / @entity143 / @entity142 swing state poll released this week , more than 50 % of voters in the battleground states of @entity56 and @entity55 said they do not feel @entity9 " cares about the needs and problems of people " like themselves			0
more than 50 % of voters polled in those two states said president @entity151 cares about their needs and problems			0
while the candidate and his team are rooting for @entity157 , it would n't be a bad thing politically if @entity13 fails to medal , said @entity160 , director of the @entity162 's @entity161			0
" this is one of these things where the candidate defers to his spouse even though the entire staff knows it 's a bad idea			0
you do n't have to be a political strategist to know this was not a good idea , " @entity160 said of the horse 's @entity97 debut this week			1
" this is no mr. ed. " winning a medal will ensure @entity9 is the butt of horse jokes for weeks to come			0
with friday 's dressage competition looming , there 's still time to make political hay out of the matter			1
" if i were the @entity9 campaign i 'd be hoping the @entity9 horse finishes fourth , " said @entity182 , a resident scholar at the @entity183			0
" the audience for dressage is not huge , but if @entity9 's horse wins the gold medal that 's a lot of attention			1
" @entity1 's @entity191 and @entity192 contributed to this report .			0
