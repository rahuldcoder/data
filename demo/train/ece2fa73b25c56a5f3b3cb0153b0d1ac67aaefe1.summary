@entity0 , @entity1 -- so many doctors are answering @entity1 's call for medical aid that the largest hospital in @entity0 has a new problem : organizing and finding good use for them all			1
" i think there is a lot of confusion , " said @entity10 , a longtime volunteer with the charity @entity11 , which runs a children 's hospital caring for some post-operative patients from the general hospital			1
@entity10 said that medical supplies and resources have improved , but the crush of volunteer doctors in @entity0 can complicate treatment in the city while there is great need for help in other places hit by the earthquake			1
@entity29 : looking for loved ones in @entity1 the general hospital has nine operating rooms , but a near platoon of volunteer surgeons			1
that leaves many standing by for work , though there are relatively few nurses			0
@entity2 's dr. @entity40 learned medical teams are taking their first steps to organize and see how many of them are needed			0
representatives from each volunteer doctor group at the general hospital gathered for a quick , to - the - point meeting over the weekend			1
" we are all well - staffed , " dr. @entity49 of @entity50 told the group			0
" the issue is coordinating			0
" auerbach is the point person to try and control the surge of doctors			0
over the weekend , he and volunteer groups started tackling some basics of treatment : how to id patients , keep records and make rounds			2
among the problems with the large number of doctors , @entity49 said , is that patients can have their dressings opened three or four times in close succession as one and then another crew of doctors come to evaluate their wounds			1
to change that , charity groups have set up shifts and literally drawn lines , sketching maps on hospital walls showing who is working where			0
they are also identifying medical centers outside @entity0 , where there is need for the booming supply of doctors in the capital			2
full coverage space is also an issue			0
a team from the @entity90 is carefully assessing the buildings that survived on hospital grounds , trying to find a stable place for post-operative care			2
patients now recover in tents or are taken to other hospitals			0
as the city 's main hospital is brimming with doctors , it is in need of nurses and physical therapists			1
thousands of amputees will need significant , specialized help from physical therapists , but few are available			2
nurses are in short supply			1
a nursing school on the grounds of the general hospital was crushed in the earthquake , killing some of the people who would be giving care now			1
the flood of outside volunteers is mostly doctors , not nurses			2
interactive map of where to find aid , hospitals in @entity1 at one point over the weekend , a mass of 12 medical workers gathered around a tiny premature infant			0
someone called out , " if you 're not a doctor , step away ! " immediately someone else responded , " we 're all doctors ! " even as they juggle an abundance of doctors , many volunteers said they worry the general hospital in @entity0 could again face dire need after this first wave of medical staff rotates out of @entity1 over the next two weeks			1
those on the ground advise doctors who want to help @entity1 to wait and volunteer in a few weeks or months .			0

largest hospital in @entity0 has too many doctors ; coordination is a problem
patients have dressings opened three , four times in close succession by different medics
volunteer nurses and physical therapists are in short supply
nursing school on grounds of general hospital was crushed in earthquake
