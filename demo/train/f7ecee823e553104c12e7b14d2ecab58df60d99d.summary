@entity0 -- the @entity3 @entity2 on wednesday upheld the 2009 convictions of 23 @entity5 whom a lower court convicted in absentia of kidnapping a terrorist suspect in @entity9 in 2003			1
it 's unlikely the court ruling will have much effect on the lives of any of the @entity5			2
none of them appeared at the original 2009 trial , nor were any of them taken into custody , and the @entity3 government did not ask for their extradition			1
the @entity21 declined to comment on the ruling wednesday			0
the trial was the first to deal with a practice that human rights groups call " extraordinary rendition			0
" they say the @entity5 has often transferred terrorism suspects to countries that practice torture			2
@entity31 has acknowledged making secret " rendition " transfers of terrorism suspects between countries but denies using torture or handing suspects over to countries that do			0
the case centered on the alleged extraordinary rendition of a @entity42 cleric , @entity41 , or @entity43 , who said he was seized on the streets of @entity9 in 2003 and then transferred to @entity45 and tortured			1
2005 : @entity3 seeks @entity5 over abduction , source says			2
@entity43 was suspected of recruiting men to fight in @entity49 and @entity50 and was under heavy surveillance by @entity3 's intelligence agency			2
prosecutors said he was nabbed by a @entity21 team working with @entity3 intelligence officials			0
" today 's ruling highlights the lack of accountability in the @entity5 courts for serious crimes committed by government officials in the name of national security , such as kidnapping and torture , " said @entity56 , director of the @entity57			1
" @entity5 diplomatic cables released by @entity69 showed that @entity31 tried to derail the @entity3 investigation instead of supporting the interests of justice			0
though legal questions remain , such as the validity of trials in absentia , @entity5 officials would be wise to heed the @entity3 court 's message that those who violate the law will be called to answer			1
" in the 2009 trial , the @entity3 court sentenced 22 of the @entity5 to five years in prison each for their role in the abduction			1
prosecutor @entity87 said @entity88 , who prosecutors say was the @entity21 station chief in @entity9 , was sentenced to eight years			0
each of the 23 @entity5 was ordered to pay 1 million euros ( about $ 1.3 million ) to @entity43 , plus 500,000 euros to his wife .			0

new : " @entity5 officials would be wise to heed the @entity3 court 's message , " @entity57 says
they were found *guilty* of kidnapping terrorist suspect @entity43 in 2003 in @entity9
@entity43 claimed the @entity5 transferred him to @entity45 for torture
none of the @entity5 appeared at trial , and extradition has not been requested
