editor 's note : @entity2 is a foreign affairs analyst who hosts " @entity2 : gps " on @entity4 at 1 p.m. et sundays			1
@entity2 says the shoe - throwing incident shows @entity6 is becoming a more open society			1
@entity8 ( @entity4 ) -- the @entity6 journalist who hurled his shoes at president @entity11 has won some hearts in neighboring @entity13 , where one cleric dubbed the act " the shoe intifada ( rebellion )			1
ayatollah @entity18 -- leading friday prayers in @entity20 -- hailed journalist @entity22 's now - famous fling last sunday , when @entity11 and @entity6 prime minister @entity23 were holding a news conference in @entity25			1
his remarks -- reported by @entity13 's state - run @entity27 -- reflect the support many @entity30 people have shown for @entity22 , an @entity6 correspondent for @entity32 - based @entity31			1
" the shoe intifada in @entity6 should not be overlooked easily , " @entity18 said			2
" well done to the @entity6 journalist for throwing the shoes at the @entity36 president			2
" speaking to worshipers at @entity38 , @entity18 labeled the shoes " more valuable than crowns , medals and signs " and believes they should be placed in an @entity6 museum			2
@entity4 spoke to world affairs expert and author @entity2 about the shoe - throwing incident @entity4 : do you think the shoe - throwing incident shows that @entity6 is becoming an open society ? @entity2 : yes , and president @entity11 was right that it represents a huge advance in freedom in the @entity30			1
there is quite simply no other @entity55 country in which that scene could have taken place			0
and @entity6 has , in other ways , become a reasonably open and democratic society -- though still a long way from a liberal democracy as we would define it			1
@entity4 : so not a big deal -- just fodder for late - night comics ? @entity2 : not quite -- what the shoe - throwing incident also reminded us of -- and this is something that @entity36 often forget -- is that whatever the gains in @entity6 recently -- and they are undeniable and real -- the costs for @entity6 have been huge			1
we focus on the costs to @entity36 -- hundreds of billions of dollars spent , more than four thousand @entity36 lives lost there			0
but the costs to the @entity6 have been staggering 2.5 million @entity6 -- 10 percent of the population -- have left the country , and only a few are trickling back			2
another 2 million have been displaced from their homes			0
tens of thousands of @entity6 have been killed and wounded -- and that may be underreported			0
maybe in the long run , if @entity6 becomes a more decent society , these costs will fade into memory and the benefits will endure			2
but for now , as @entity22 's actions showed -- it is the costs that remain front and center in the @entity6 consciousness			0
@entity4 : how are @entity6 responding to the incident ? @entity2 : for many it is embarrassment -- as former @entity36 ambassador to @entity6 and the current @entity36 ambassador to the @entity96 @entity95 says on our show -- " i know it was painful to prime minister @entity23 and many @entity6 who have been in touch with me since			1
" and the @entity6 are going to prosecute @entity22 within their court system -- though they are n't completely sure how yet			0
@entity4 : but it seems like he 's become a hero for many in the @entity30			0
@entity2 : yes -- and that goes back to the enormous costs that the @entity6 have faced			1
however , his celebrity is not limited to the @entity30			0
in an act of reverse cultural imperialism , his act of frustration is now taking hold in the @entity36			0
earlier this week at a meeting of @entity8 's @entity117 , an angry protester was dragged out as he attempted to throw his shoe at the authority 's ceo			0
his last words before security got him : " this shoe is for you ! "			0

@entity2 : shoe - throwing incident shows @entity6 is becoming more open society
incident also focuses attention on what @entity6 *war* has cost @entity6 , he says
@entity2 says incident is an embarrassment to many @entity6
