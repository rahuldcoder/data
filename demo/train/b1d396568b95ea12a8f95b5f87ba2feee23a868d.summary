-- @entity2 - licence to kill			1
@entity3 -- licence to thrill			1
one has brought down tyrants , saved @entity6 and country and entertained generations of fans for over 50 years			0
the other has produced moments of magic which have defied all logic with a right foot more deadly than @entity2 's @entity16 gun			1
but neither 007 nor @entity3 , have worked out a way to combat their latest enemy - an invasion of privacy			1
it 's a topic which has left @entity21 , the man who produced a stellar performance as @entity2 in the recent @entity24 epic , both shaken and stirred			1
@entity21 , who first played @entity2 six years ago in @entity26 , has seen his life change irreversibly with his public life now constantly afflicted			1
culture shock while @entity3 may enjoy a life of glamor , the fact that he can not even pop out to his local @entity32 without being bothered continues to irk him			1
his very public relationship with @entity38 model @entity36 , a celebrity in her own right , has brought extra attention to one of the football 's most famous faces			2
both men have their photos plastered across billboards worldwide , their pictures on television commercials broadcast around the globe and their private lives played out on the internet			0
so why do the likes of @entity21 and @entity3 , who make millions of dollars from their public image , believe they deserve privacy ? for the 27 - year - old @entity58 superstar , who hails from the quiet and picturesque island of @entity60 , it has come as something of a culture shock			1
@entity3 admits perceived arrogance has cost him " yeah , of course , " @entity3 told @entity0 after being asked whether he wished he could lead a normal life			1
" not just now , but the last five , six years			0
" sometimes i wish to go somewhere , shopping , @entity32 ... not a great example , or to have coffee and people recognize me			0
" we are famous and we have to deal with that			1
" smart phones with the advanced technology of smart phones and the advent of @entity77 and other social media networks , stars are far more cautious when stepping out of their front doors			2
for @entity21 , who undertook huge lengths to keep his wedding to fellow film star @entity84 a complete secret , the right to privacy is key			1
" how could i go into a pub and have a few pints of @entity88 and get a bit rowdy and sing a few songs when some tw * t 's going to film me and put it all over the internet ? " @entity21 was recently quoted as saying in the @entity95 media			1
" the difference , and this has changed rapidly in about 10 years , is smart phones			0
" they are the f * * * ing bane of my life			2
i get people who just take pictures of me with their camera phone while i 'm having dinner			0
i want to get violent and i ca n't			0
' @entity24 ' is @entity2 resurrected and reinvigorated " they think it 's their right to take a photo of me and i find that incredibly intrusive			1
but every phone has a camera on it , so how do we stop it ? we ca n't			0
" risk it seems as if nobody in the world of celebrities is untouchable with the @entity119 just one of the most recent high profile scandals			0
the princess , who was on vacation in @entity123 at the time , was snapped by a paparazzo while topless with the photos eventually being published in a @entity123 magazine			0
that case caused a furore and brought up the question of whether those in the public eye have the right to privacy			2
@entity95 privacy should start with @entity95 press the @entity137 inquiry , which looked into the culture , practices and ethics of the press , allowed celebrities such as @entity142 and @entity143 to reveal the harassment they had encountered while in the public eye			2
but there are those who believe that celebrities can still live a normal life without being encroached upon			2
" you can avoid it if you do n't crave the attention , " said pr guru @entity148			0
for every sports star like @entity3 , there is a @entity154 or @entity155 , both of whom manage to stay out of the media eye with little fuss			2
the key , according to @entity148 , is awareness and caution			0
" everyone out there now has phones and can take pictures , in a way , everyone is the press now but you 've just got to be sensible , " he added			0
how a publicist heads off damaging claims against celebrities " if you do n't want to be seen with somebody , then do n't take the risk			0
" i 've told clients over and over again , you ca n't expect the media to build you up and help your career and then turn around and complain about the attention			2
" for famous people , it 's part of life and you just have to get used to it and deal with it			1
" havoc dealing with it sounds simple but it can prove far more difficult , depending how high up you are on the fame scale			0
even the ' @entity195 ' , @entity194 , has found it difficult to cope with the intrusion into his private life since leading @entity199 to @entity201 glory in 2004			1
@entity194 's world has been turned upside down by the constant attention on @entity58 both in @entity204 and abroad since moving to @entity58 in 2010			2
' i hate my social life , ' says @entity194 it has wreaked havoc on his personal life and that of his wife and two children			1
" i hate my social life , " @entity194 told @entity0 in an exclusive interview			1
" i hate not to be a normal father who goes with his son to the son 's football match and being there with the other 20 fathers there watching the game			0
" i 'm at a football match of kids and i have to be there			0
the people have to come for photos ; the people have to come for autographs ; the people have to come to insult me ; the people have to go behind the goal of my kid and insult my kid of 12			0
" so , you know , i would love to be with my family in the street as a normal person and i ca n't , so i am a completely different person in my private life			0
" but for now @entity194 , like @entity3 and @entity21 , must endure , as they continue their constant battle to secure a right to privacy .			1

@entity3 *struggling* to *protect* his right to privacy
@entity3 : " we are famous and we have to deal with that "
@entity194 told @entity0 : " i hate my social life " @entity21 has seen his privacy **eroded** since taking @entity2 role
