@entity0 , @entity1 -- a convoy of 280 @entity5 trucks headed for @entity1 , which @entity6 says is carrying relief goods for war - weary civilians , has suddenly changed course , according to a @entity1 state news agency			1
with thousands of @entity5 troops still posted near the @entity1 border and @entity1 's military putting increasing pressure on @entity16 fighters around the city of @entity18 , many in @entity1 and elsewhere fear that the so - called humanitarian mission is actually an attempt to smuggle supplies to @entity16 rebels			1
" @entity5 keeps inventing new excuses for their policy , " @entity1 's deputy foreign minister , @entity24 , said tuesday in @entity0			1
" in @entity28 , it was defending pro-russian minorities			0
in @entity1 's @entity32 , preventing @entity31 invasion			0
" the @entity34 contacted the aid convoy in the @entity36 , the organization said thursday via @entity37			0
the group said it would discuss with @entity1 officials how the operation will be conducted			0
the convoy was seen earlier in the day 25 miles from the @entity1 border in the @entity36 , according to video shot and distributed by @entity44			2
if the trucks cross the border and before they reach the area controlled by separatists , they would have to be examined by @entity1 border guards , a @entity1 security official said			2
at that point , the convoy would be handed over to @entity56 representatives , the official said			2
the office of the @entity1 counterterrorism operation said thursday it could not confirm that the convoy has crossed on the @entity1 side			2
the @entity1 border service denied reports that the convoy had crossed from @entity5			1
" all responsibility for the safety of this convoy lays with @entity5 because it is controlling armed mercenaries there , " @entity1 national security and defense council spokesman @entity64 told reporters in @entity0			1
the trucks had been expected to arrive at a checkpoint in @entity74 on wednesday but bypassed that route , according to the website @entity76			1
it 's not clear what route the convoy will now take			0
" in @entity89 , " @entity24 said , referring to the war - torn eastern region of @entity1 that includes the contested cities of @entity18 and @entity84 , " they are trying to use the pretext of humanitarian aid and assistance			1
" without offering proof , @entity1 officials have even accused @entity5 of repainting military vehicles white to disguise their efforts			1
in @entity0 , where many loyalties lie with the @entity1 government , skepticism of @entity5 president @entity98 's motive was rampant among residents			1
" normal people do not send guns to kill people and food for them to eat in the same cars , " said it specialist @entity100			0
" i think most @entity1 want him to leave @entity1 alone			0
" and it 's not just the @entity1 raising concerns about a possible @entity5 trojan horse			1
@entity56 flummoxed in an interview monday with @entity44 , @entity31 secretary general @entity111 spoke of a " high probability " that @entity5 will invade @entity1			1
" we see the @entity5 developing the narrative and the pretext for such an operation under the guise of a humanitarian operation , and we see a military buildup that could be used to conduct such illegal military operations in @entity1 , " he said			2
@entity5 has acknowledged sending the convoy			0
in a conversation monday with the president of the @entity124 , @entity98 said his country was working with the @entity34 to deliver aid to civilians suffering as a result of savage fighting there			0
except the @entity56 said at the time that it did n't know what @entity98 was talking about			0
spokesman @entity132 said the agency does n't have any agreement with @entity5 on such a convoy			0
and @entity56 @entity137 operations chief @entity136 said tuesday in @entity138 that the agency has n't gotten much clarity from @entity6 about its purported role in the operation , including how the aid would be handed over and security guarantees for @entity56 workers			0
" we said that we could be on board but that we needed to have some clarification first regarding modalities , practical steps that have to be implemented prior to a launch of such an operation , " he said			0
@entity56 officials do n't even know what 's in the shipment , @entity136 said			0
according to the @entity5 news agency @entity157 , the shipment is bound for @entity84 and contains 400 tons of grain , 100 tons of sugar , 62 tons of baby food , 54 tons of medical supplies , sleeping bags and " electrical power units			0
" at the opening of a @entity1 cabinet meeting on wednesday , prime minister @entity164 said that " @entity1 can receive humanitarian aid exclusively through the @entity56 and within international legal framework			1
" ' false pretense ' but after an incident saturday in which @entity1 officials claim to have stopped a purported aid convoy accompanied by @entity5 troops , @entity1 has vowed to stop any " uncertified " aid convoy from @entity5			1
in the saturday incident , @entity1 's deputy head of the presidential administration @entity176 told a @entity1 television channel that the convoy was nothing more than a @entity5 provocation			1
" under a false pretense of agreement with the @entity34 in @entity1 , a humanitarian convoy of ' peacekeepers ' was ready to enter the country , apparently in order to provoke a full - scale conflict , " he said			2
@entity189 officials have warned @entity5 against using aid as a means of wading deeper into the @entity1 conflict			1
at a @entity195 meeting saturday , @entity189 ambassador @entity193 said @entity5 has no business delivering aid in @entity1 when international aid groups are better equipped to do the job			1
" therefore , any further unilateral intervention by @entity5 into @entity1 territory -- including one under the guise of providing humanitarian aid -- would be completely unacceptable and deeply alarming , " she said			1
" and it would be viewed as an invasion of @entity1			0
" secretary of state @entity205 made a similar point with his @entity5 counterpart on saturday , according to the @entity208			0
while @entity211 leaders have refused any suggestion that @entity5 acts could draw @entity31 nations into war over @entity1 , they do say it would lead to even stricter economic sanctions against @entity5 than those already imposed by the @entity189 and the @entity219			1
so far , @entity5 officials have shrugged off the sanctions			0
rebels on the ropes ? @entity6 's decision to send the convoy comes as about 50,000 @entity1 troops press forward with an offensive to rout rebel fighters from @entity18			2
they have put increasing pressure on the rebel fighters , and @entity1 officials say they expect to be able to fully recapture the city by @entity1 's @entity233 on august 24			0
the ongoing fighting -- sparked last year with a political crisis over whether @entity1 would seek closer ties with @entity137 or @entity5 -- has left more than 2,000 people dead and just under 5,000 wounded in eastern @entity1 since mid-april , according to estimates from @entity195 officials that they called " conservative			2
" the officials say the death toll has been on the rise in recent days , with reports of at least 41 killed and 143 wounded on thursday alone			0
hundreds of thousands have been forced to flee their homes and seek shelter either elsewhere in @entity1 or across the border in @entity5 , the @entity244 says			2
@entity5 's @entity98 issues retaliatory ban on food imports opinion : why @entity98 is n't going to make peace how rebels in @entity1 built up an arsenal capable of reaching the skies @entity255 reported and wrote from @entity256 ; @entity257 reported from @entity0 ; @entity2 's @entity258 , @entity259 and journalist @entity260 contributed to this report .			1
