-- the killing of 16 unarmed @entity3 civilians is , as president @entity4 has said , heartbreaking			1
families have lost children , mothers and fathers in a rampage that has left @entity3 reeling			1
for @entity3 it is the latest in a pattern of disrespect and dishonor : the burnings of the @entity14 that ignited protests , video of @entity18 soldiers urinating on @entity20 corpses , kill teams in @entity22			1
the horror of the killings offers a public relations victory for the @entity20 and leaves @entity3 wondering whose side they should be on			1
is this the kind of " peace " they should believe in and rely on ? both hearts and minds have been shattered and lost			2
and , devastatingly , another casualty of this rampage is the quiet voices of men and women who risk their lives each day to fight for the progress of their country			1
human rights activists , midwives , high school principals , doctors , entrepreneurs and young students crowding on to @entity46 like kids everywhere else in the world			1
their voices pleading for patience and calm are lost in the violence , mistrust and misunderstanding of the last few months			0
these warriors for progress are rarely heard in the media , but the jeopardy in which they place themselves is very real : since 2011 , @entity22 's mayor was assassinated in his home , the city 's police chief was assassinated and an educator in @entity67 province was shot and killed for the crime of educating girls			1
the killings in @entity22 by insurgents are another strike against people who simply want to live in a secure country where they can support their families and send their children to school safely			0
the bloodshed thus far in 2012 bolsters those in the @entity18 and @entity3 who say that a swift international exit from @entity3 is the only answer			1
on the other side are those who argue the @entity18 must stay the course militarily			0
stuck in between are the country 's women , who have fought since the @entity20 's departure to strengthen their own rights to go to work and to school and to lead their communities			1
more than 2 million girls are now in school			0
women make up a quarter of the @entity94			2
and nearly 3,000 midwives go out each day to save women 's lives in a country that @entity99 rated the deadliest for expectant mothers			1
women i speak with feel caught in a political ambush			2
they enjoy little protection from their own government , they are under fire and constant threat from anti-government insurgents and now troops sent to protect them are contributing to the violence			0
women who fear deeply for the erosion of their own rights if the @entity20 return are told by some in their community : " would you rather have this ? is this alternative any better ? is this peace ? " and their push for progress this past decade is tied by their opponents to an international effort increasingly seen as drenched in disrespect			1
@entity3 president @entity129 has been balancing for political survival on a tightrope between the international community on one side and his country 's most conservative elements on the other			1
the more peace talks with the @entity20 in @entity139 become a reality , the further the @entity129 administration seems to tilt in favor of the conservatives : recently , @entity129 signed off on a code of conduct for women released by clerics on the @entity147 that said women should not travel without a male guardian or mix with men in offices or schools			1
women activists say they do not want troops in their country forever			1
but they worry what the international community will leave behind as it hurries for the exits			0
timelines seem to determine events on the ground rather than the other way around			0
as parliamentarian @entity168 told me in the wake of the @entity14 protests , " if the international community decides to leave tomorrow , women will be the first victim of the talibanization of the government			2
" no one is championing endless war in @entity3			2
for @entity18 , too much national treasure has been spilled and the treasury has been depleted			0
drawdown plans leading to 2014 are well under way and will continue to unfold in the coming days			0
but how the international community gets out matters			0
and so does what it leaves behind			0
we have trapped ourselves in an all - or - nothing conversation			0
the military alone can not end the war in @entity3 -- and @entity18 military officials are the first to say this			2
but after " drawdown , " two other " ds " are critical			0
diplomacy -- talks about @entity3 's future that involve all @entity3 sides and regional players and include women			1
and development dollars -- funds that help local government and civil society keep schools open , clinics functioning and midwives working after 2014 has come and gone			2
already an orphanage i know is facing funding problems as it works to keep boys and girls off streets and out of trouble			0
a withdrawal of troops should not mean an abandonment of @entity3			1
this is not simply about @entity18 altruism			0
this is about leaving behind a state stable and secure enough that @entity18 forces will never have to go back			0
@entity3 women are not a pet project taken up by the international community			1
they are a stability indicator whose involvement in their own societies is in the best interest of lasting security			0
any agreement that leaves them out will simply be a short - term deal , not a durable peace			0
women 's involvement in their own country 's future is a must - have for the @entity18 president to get what he has said he wants : a " responsible " end game for @entity18 's longest war			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity239 .			2
