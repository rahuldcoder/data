@entity0 -- apparently , @entity2 did n't get the memo			1
" wednesday night is the restart of this campaign , and i think you 're going to see those numbers start to move right back in the other direction , " the @entity6 @entity5 governor said sunday on @entity8 's " @entity7			1
" @entity2 raises the bar for debate note to gov. @entity2 : no , no , no , no , no. standard operating procedure for pre-debate chatter is to lower expectations for your guy by raising expectations for the other guy			1
the way @entity24 's running mate , @entity24 , did on @entity25 : " president @entity26 is a very -- he 's a very gifted speaker			1
... the man 's been on the national stage for many years , he 's an experienced debater			2
" and because this is a bipartisanly accepted strategy , @entity26 's guy @entity30 did it too : " we have expected all along that gov. @entity24 will have a good night			1
he has prepared more than any candidate in history			0
and he has shown himself to be a very , very good debater through the years			0
" @entity26 campaign : do n't expect zingers further , governor , since you are supporting the candidate who is running behind ( you are supporting him , right ? ) , then you also need to lower the stakes for wednesday 's first of three presidential debates			1
as @entity49 told me : " frankly , i ca n't remember the last time there was one of these comments that grabbed everybody 's attention because , frankly , the candidates are too well - prepared			2
they 're well - scripted			0
" what does @entity24 need to do to change the race ? and as @entity24 did ( obviously he got the memo ) : " i do n't think one event is going to make or break this campaign			2
" but definitely , gov. @entity2 , definitely not the way you did : " and i 'm telling you , thursday morning , you 're all going to be scratching your heads and saying , ' wow , we have a barn - burner now for the next 33 days			1
' " what questions would you like to ask the candidates ? share a short video question			0
because the thing is , when you say that , @entity30 says stuff like this : " they expect to come out of this with the race fundamentally changed			0
now , what does that mean ? if it 's going to fundamentally change , that means in seven or 10 days from now you 'll see states like @entity77 tied , the state of @entity79 tied , because that 's what really matters here			0
" you know what they say , governor -- there 's no heavier burden than great expectations			2
on the other hand , you may be onto something : actually believing ( you do , right ? ) and saying out loud ( which you did ) that you think your guy will do great			0
talk to you thursday morning ? -- @entity92			0

both sides have played low - expectations game about wednesday 's debate
@entity5 gov. @entity2 defies @entity6 , *predicts* debate will be game - changer for @entity24
@entity2 's *prediction* sets high expectations for @entity24 , who is running behind
