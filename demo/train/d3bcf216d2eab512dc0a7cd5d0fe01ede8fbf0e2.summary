-- the @entity1 celebrated its birthday saturday by focusing on aging , including a host of events , research and information under the theme , " good health adds life to years			1
" leaders and nonprofit organizations took to @entity12 to mark @entity13 and toast the @entity1 , whose constitution was enacted april 7 , 1948 , to affirm its mission as the " directing and coordinating authority for health within the @entity19 system			1
" these groups included the @entity22 @entity21 , @entity23 , the @entity24 and the @entity25 , among others			0
the @entity19 itself also chimed in , with @entity28 ban ki - moon urging civic and private leaders to devote " attention and resources to ensuring that people everywhere have the chance to grow older in good health			2
" that includes realizing the many ways older people contribute to society , as well as knowing what it will take to take care of them as they age			1
by 2050 , the @entity1 estimates that there will be almost 400 million people age 80 and older -- compared to about 14 million people in that age group around 1950			1
" older people make many valuable contributions to society -- as family members , as active participants in the workforce and as volunteers within communities			0
the wisdom they have gained throughout their lives makes them a unique resource for society , " @entity55 said in a press release			0
" but more older people also means an increased demand on health care and social security systems			0
" the who itself marked @entity13 with festivities at its headquarters in @entity71 , @entity72			0
the organization 's campaign aims , in part , to challenge stereotypes about older people -- like that they ca n't take care of themselves , ca n't work or play as well as others , and are no longer attractive			2
the @entity1 said it is important that older people are engaged in their societies and in their health , and that citizens and governments are similarly committed			1
having sound preparations and actions to address the aging population is not only a moral imperative , but also one that makes sense economically and politically , according to the agency			1
" if we can ensure that people are living healthier as well as longer lives , the opportunities will be greater and the costs to society less , " @entity1 director - general @entity90 said in the foreword of the " @entity92 for @entity93			2
