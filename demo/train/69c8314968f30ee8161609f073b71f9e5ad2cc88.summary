@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 -- the world 's second - largest economy -- is in a recession , government officials announced monday			1
@entity1 's @entity7 confirmed that its economy shrank another 0.1 percent in the third quarter , following a 0.9 percent drop in the second quarter			1
the country 's gross domestic product -- second to the @entity15 -- has fallen by 0.4 percent this year , pushing @entity1 into its first recession since 2001			1

the @entity26 on friday officially declared that the 15 - nation group had entered into a recession , with its gross domestic product declining 0.2 percent for the second straight quarter			1
@entity1 prime minister @entity31 was among the @entity33 world leaders who met in @entity34 over the weekend , unveiling a set of sweeping plans aimed at tackling the ever - expanding economic crisis , which has roiled financial markets worldwide			2
the @entity40 members at the historic two - day meeting managed to find some common ground on the causes of the crisis and areas that need to be fixed			0
the plans include interest rate cuts by central banks around the globe or potential economic stimulus packages , and boosting developing countries struggling under the weight of the crisis			0
@entity1 's recession announcement was not unexpected			1
part of the problem is the strong yen , which skyrocketed in recent weeks as turmoil in the world 's financial markets and concerns about a global recession drove investors away from high - yielding currencies such as the euro and the pound			0
as a result , lower - yielding currencies like the dollar and the yen surged in value , because they are considered by many investors to be a safe haven			0
since @entity1 is such a big exporter of goods , a more robust yen hurts profits for @entity1 firms as sales from abroad get translated back into yen			0
the more that the yen has climbed , the worse @entity1 's stock market has performed , which has resulted in a ripple effect on @entity25 and @entity15 exchanges			2
after an early sell - off monday , @entity1 's nikkei 225 stock index rebounded with a gain of about 2 percent late in the morning			1
