@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the northwest of @entity1 's mountainous @entity8 province , among the world 's most biodiverse areas , a green revolution is under way among rural residents			0
@entity11 was the first to adopt alternative energy in @entity8 's @entity13			1
in @entity13 near @entity14 , @entity11 says he has been able to maximize profits by spending more time growing crops since installing a biogas digester - greenhouse , solar water heater , energy - efficient stove and rain - collecting cistern			1
he installed them with loans from the bank and grants from @entity25 , becoming in 2003 the first in his village to adopt alternative energy			1
since then , his income has tripled to 40,000 - 50,000 yuan ( $ 5,800 - $ 7,300 ) , he said			2
the region , which sees the crossing of three of @entity34 's great rivers -- the @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 -- is a poor one , with firewood traditionally being the source for cooking , heating and housing for half a million households			1
however , despite a decade - long ban on commercial logging , such a firewood - dependent lifestyle poses a threat to @entity8 's forests and its more than 17,000 plants and wildlife , including the endangered golden monkey			0
@entity11 's status as @entity54 's village leader made him a natural choice to launch the alternative energy project there			1
by enlisting him as an ally , @entity25 was able to slowly persuade other villagers , who would otherwise be hesitant to invest their limited money			0
hundreds of households in the area have followed his lead			2
under the @entity25 's alternative energy project , 820 households adopted biogas digesters , and 600 adopted solar water heaters , many of them choosing both , according to @entity71 , communications manager at the nongovernmental organization 's @entity73 office			1
the @entity25 says it and partners have taken the alternative energy project to 420 villages in @entity8 , installing more than 14,000 biogas units , energy efficient stoves and solar water heating systems			1
most of those villages are remote and had relied on nearby forests as opposed to a power grid			0
to tap money for such devices , villagers can receive small loans under the @entity90			0
part of the @entity95 's @entity94 ( @entity94 ) initiative , the program has successful precedents in five @entity98 nations -- @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 -- and northeast @entity104			0
the approach , developed by clean energy investor @entity106 , helps entrepreneurs take risks in an otherwise emerging sector in order to gain public trust and attract commercial investment			0
the goal is to overcome the hurdles generally posed by limited money and training in such remote areas -- and reduce fuel wood consumption by 75 percent			0
the initiative -- which links the government with nongovernmental organizations and financial institutions -- harnesses financing , alternative energy sources , entrepreneurship and training into income - generating activities			1
in addition , the creed initiative aims to provide alternatives for rural areas where women and children shoulder the burden of collecting firewood and wood burning			2
the number of hours spent daily , as well as the detrimental health effects of wood burning and indoor pollution -- such as eye and respiratory ailments -- risk contributing to the persistence of the area 's poverty			2
in a report last year ( " investing in a @entity149 " ) , the @entity95 said that finance is " essential " in addressing climate change			0
" without substantial and sustained investment in clean energy and other measures now , the reality of a global economy free of climate change impacts will remain a distant dream , " the report noted			0
for most @entity8 households , whose average yearly income is a few hundred dollars , a biogas digester ( $ 150 - $ 300 ) , a solar water heater ( $ 400 ) , or an efficiency stove ( $ 40 - 80 ) is too costly , @entity25 points out			2
under @entity90 , households can apply for loans up to 10,000 yuan ( $ 1460 ) after mapping out their income - generating activity from such devices			2
to offset any default , 5 percent of the loan is deposited at a bank as a guarantee , and a solidarity group of five to eight households is formed to share responsibility for the member 's loan repayments			2
in return , participants get technical support and have about 18 months to pay the loan off			0
nearly 600 households have been able to tap more than $ 300,000 in loans to purchase such energy - efficient systems and generate income , thanks to @entity90			1
whereas @entity11 's family used to spend hours seeking , chopping and carrying firewood , the switch to alternative energy has enabled them to save the equivalent of 100 working days , he estimated			1
thanks to the solar heater , a shower is a daily possibility , and the biogas digester -- which converts human and pig waste to a clean gas that can be pressurized -- has enabled cooking and lighting			0
more time is then left to devote to his income - generating greenhouse , which uses waste slurry left over from the biogas digester as fertilizer for his grapes , strawberries , apples , plums , cherries , peaches , eggplant , cucumber , tomatoes and squash			0
thanks to increased income , his children were freed up to attend the university , said the 53 - year - old @entity11 , whose own education ended with high school			1
@entity11 's children have since graduated ; his son became a magazine editor , while his daughter became a government official , @entity11 said			1
" what we have today can not be separated from alternative energy , " @entity11 told journalists visiting his home last year			1
his life 's goal , he said , was to educate the next generation well and see an improvement in his grandchildren 's lives			0
elsewhere in @entity1 , biogas projects have proven more popular than in @entity8 , where colder temperatures generally require a greenhouse to cover the units			0
as of the end of 2007 , more than 26.5 million rural households were using household biodigesters , saving the equivalent of 44 million tons of co2 emissions , according to @entity1 's @entity253			1
the number is notable for a country criticized for its environmental record while trying to bridge a wide income gap between urban dwellers and rural residents who lack access to modern energy services .			2

half a million households have traditionally used wood for cooking , heating , housing
village leader @entity11 was first in @entity269 to adopt alternative energy
hundreds of households have since *signed* on , thanks to credit and grants
@entity11 's income has tripled ; children freed up to attend university , he says
