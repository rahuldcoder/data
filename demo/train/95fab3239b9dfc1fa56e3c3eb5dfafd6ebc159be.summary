-- for years , children from @entity2 , @entity3 , have attended schools across the border in @entity6 , @entity7 , but this week that changed for students who can not prove residency			1
the local school superintendent imposed new regulations to stem what he said is a long - standing problem for the district			1
" i have seen van loads of kids with plates from @entity20 ( in @entity3 ) pulling in front of the school , " @entity16 superintendent @entity15 told @entity0			1
" everyone knows what is going on			0
" @entity15 , who joined the district 11 months ago , previously was superintendent in the border town of @entity28 , @entity29 , where he had to deal with similar circumstances			1
there , he remembered , he once had 32 students with the same home address			2
when district officials checked , the property was a vacant lot			2
in @entity6 , @entity15 said he began to notice " there was some slackness in the protocol " dealing with proof of residency			2
" border towns are really unique , " @entity15 told @entity0 in a phone interview			2
" there is a lot of fluidity between the two cities			0
having grown up in the border , i know this is very common			2
" last week , @entity15 received confirmation from authorities at the @entity53 border crossing that some 540 school - age kids were crossing the bridge in the mornings			1
@entity15 said the situation was " getting out of hand , " and on wednesday he dispatched district staff members to the bridge to talk to the parents accompanying their children from the @entity3 side			1
the staff was able to identify 195 students that could be barred from the district 's schools if they failed to provide proof they lived within the district			1
three of the students were @entity73 ' children			2
in a phone interview , @entity74 told @entity0 she lives in @entity6 with her sister - in - law , but she travels back and forth to @entity2 to see her husband , who was deported			0
on wednesday , @entity74 was stopped by school district staff and received a letter saying that her children would be dropped from enrollments if she could n't provide proof of residency			1
to prove residency , the district requires parents or guardians to provide an official document such as a utility bill , lease or proof - of - rent payment , none of which @entity74 said she can provide since everything is in her sister - in - law 's name			1
she said her only alternative may be homeschooling her children			0
@entity15 said he knows some of the parents who received letters are upset , especially those with children who are @entity101 citizens			0
but he said the issue is a matter or residency , not citizenship or immigration status			2
" citizenship is a moot point			0
it really comes down to whether you live here , " @entity15 said			0
" frequently , they ( @entity3 ) come with the impression that their kids are @entity101 citizens , so they can go to school here , " he added			1
" i am not @entity101 @entity117 , @entity118 or @entity119			0
if you are a resident here , you get to go to school here , if you do n't , you do n't			0
this is not a matter of border enforcement			0
" a 1982 @entity127 ruling protects students from being discriminated upon based on immigration status , but @entity7 law states the student must live in a school district 's area to attend a school within that district			1
@entity15 and his staff are trying to work out a tuition system for students who can not prove residency			1
he is in talks with state agencies to calculate an appropriate tuition fee , but the school board would first have to approve the program			1
" we are saying if we have room , you can pay tuition			0
we do n't want this to be a burden on taxpayers			0
some of the parents we have talked to have expressed interest in paying tuition , " he said			0
but as @entity15 has learned this week , the tuition program has proven unsuccessful in other cities			0
he has spoken with three superintendents of other border school districts , all of whom have said to him they tried the tuition program but it did n't work			1
" i got the impression from them it was not worth the hassle , " he said			0
but losing non-resident students could wind up costing the district			1
@entity15 estimated that in a worst - case scenario , the district could lose some $ 2.7 million in state funding since budgets are based on attendance			0
there are currently about 10,000 students in the district .			2
