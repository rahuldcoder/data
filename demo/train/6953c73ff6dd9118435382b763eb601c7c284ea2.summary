to reach agreement with @entity10 saturday in @entity11 is a good thing if it allows the @entity3 and @entity13 to sort out what really divides them on the @entity10 nuclear issue before negotiations resume in coming days			1
that the @entity5 -- not the @entity3 -- seem to have taken the lead in stiffening the allies ' demands with @entity10 is in itself a reflection of those differences			1
and while a high - ranking @entity3 delegation headed to @entity13 sunday to brief the @entity13 on the talks , bridging the gap there wo n't be that easy			1
where you stand in life has a great deal to do with where you sit			0
prime minister @entity34 's fierce reaction to the effort to reach an interim agreement reflects the realities of a small power with much less room to maneuver on a critical security issue than a great one			1
and it reveals the sensitivities of an @entity13 leader who 's far more invested politically in seeing a nuke - free @entity10 , far more suspicious of @entity10 motives and far more worried about the consequences of a bad deal for @entity13 than a @entity3 president who 's concerned more about what happens if there 's no deal and @entity13 or the @entity3 slides toward military confrontation with the mullahs who rule @entity10			1
that gap between the @entity3 and @entity13 is real			1
and it should neither be trivialized nor exaggerated			0
but short of a final deal in which @entity10 abandons its nuclear ambitions , it may not be bridgeable			2
these two allies will need to manage it as best they can			0
@entity64 and @entity65 with non-predatory neighbors to its north and south and fish to its east and west , the @entity3 enjoys a level of physical security unprecedented in the history of great and small powers			2
that gives @entity3 a margin for error that the small power simply can not afford			0
indeed , @entity3 have a hard time internalizing what it 's like to be a small nation living on the knife 's edge , whose tiny physical size , isolation and sense of vulnerability exists alongside its power and strength			2
i do n't think @entity10 wants nuclear weapons to launch a first strike against @entity13			1
but it 's impossible to ignore , let alone trivialize , @entity13 security concerns and vulnerabilities in this regard , particularly in the face of @entity10 's rhetoric , regional ambitions and support for terrorism over the years			1
@entity13 is n't some hapless victim , a piece of driftwood bobbing about on a turbulent sea ; it 's a dynamic nation ( and a nuclear weapons state ) with great military power with the capacity if need be to deal with @entity10 too			1
but that does n't take away from the reality that it 's a small country living in a dangerous neighborhood			0
@entity34 's @entity113 all @entity13 prime ministers are said to sleep with one eye open			1
@entity34 sleeps with two eyes open			0
no @entity13 prime minister can afford to take @entity13 's security for granted			1
but ever since i 've known him , the key to understanding this prime minister is that he 's immersed in the proposition that @entity13 's very survival ca n't be taken for granted either			1
all @entity13 leaders function in a high threat environment			0
but in @entity34 's case , it defines his world and creates an us - against - them sensibility that extends to @entity13 's adversaries and its friends too			1
he has been deeply suspicious of @entity3 motives for many years and believes the @entity3 does n't understand the @entity135 or @entity13 's security predicament			1
you live in @entity138 , he 's said to me on more than one occasion ; we live in a dangerous neighborhood with little margin for error			0
i never argued with him			0
what was the point ? unlike @entity13 , there is no existential threat to the @entity3 from any external enemy largely because of where we are			1
but @entity13 's history has been marked by a continuous series of threats -- large and small -- by virtue of where the @entity13 are			2
however powerful they have become , that legacy endures			0
and combined with the dark history of the @entity162 people culminating in the @entity8 genocide , it has left an enduring mark			0
the notion that @entity13 fight the @entity135 during the day and win and fight the @entity166 at night and lose carries particular resonance with this @entity13 prime minister			1
the late @entity13 prime minister @entity169 never used @entity171 imagery to describe the contemporary threats to @entity13 's security			1
@entity174 refused to use @entity176 analogies when discussing @entity10			0
@entity10 is @entity8 ; former @entity10 president @entity177 is @entity176 and we 're in 1938 on the nuclear issue			2
it infuses his rhetoric and his world view			1
and while @entity183 has changed the tone and may be genuinely looking for an agreement , the charm offensive has n't dulled the acuteness of @entity34 's suspicions			1
consequences of @entity13 - @entity3 tensions this world view poses enormous challenges for a @entity3 administration , partly because it 's validated by @entity10 's own past rhetoric and actions and because @entity10 has tried to hide suspected military aspects of its nuclear program			1
leaving an angry , aggrieved @entity13 in the wake of an interim deal with @entity10 that is judged to be a bad deal carries tremendous risk and consequence			2
first , the focus is now on an interim agreement -- a first step			0
that means that we wo n't know the end state for at least six months			0
time is both an enemy and an ally here			0
the step - by - step approach creates time to test intentions			0
it also affords time for @entity10 to continue to advance aspects of its nuclear program and to develop a break - out capacity to dash for weapons			2
and they are going to be a rocky six months if @entity34 concludes that the interim arrangements reached in @entity11 work to @entity10 's advantage			1
going right to the endgame would be ideal			0
but it 's just not feasible			0
there 's too much suspicion and mistrust			0
and neither @entity10 nor the @entity3 are prepared for that			2
so there 's built in @entity3 - @entity13 tension inherent in the structure of the talks themselves			1
second , while the prime minister 's fierce reaction to events in @entity11 is driven by genuine anger and concern , it 's also designed to begin to stir up opposition in @entity239			1
and it wo n't take much stirring			0
there 's zero capacity in @entity239 to give @entity10 the benefit of the doubt on anything			1
and @entity239 is already inclined to adopt the @entity13 view that what 's required now is more pressure on the mullahs rather than less , including additional sanctions			1
the idea that the @entity253 administration would want to place itself in a position of defending a deal with @entity10 that @entity13 and much of @entity239 oppose -- and appear implicitly to be defending the @entity10 in the process -- defies the laws of political gravity , particularly for a much weakened president			1
to overcome these political downsides and go into battle mode , the administration would really have to have a compelling interim agreement that 's sound and defensible			0
third , the @entity3 is measuring an agreement with @entity10 at this stage not against an ideal end state -- @entity10 capitulates and surrenders any hope of maintaining the capacity to enrich uranium , let alone make bombs			1
it 's evaluating success in terms of what 's practical and what will happen if no deal is reached , namely the slide toward the use of military force against @entity10			2
@entity13 do n't want a war with @entity10 either ; but they are much more comfortable with threatening military action and conditioned to accept the possibility that force may have to be used , even if the end state is an imperfect one and @entity10 sets about rebuilding a nuclear program			2
the key issue is putting time on the clock to delay @entity10 getting nukes -- preferably through diplomacy , but if necessary by force			2
fourth , an already problematic @entity13 - @entity291 peace process is going to get a lot more complicated			0
narrowing the gaps on borders , refugees and @entity296 was always going to be tough ; but now getting @entity34 to make decisions will be almost impossible			0
@entity13 - @entity291 peace process at risk whether the administration thought through the overlapping of a peace process with a nine - month timeline and a negotiation with @entity10 of six months now aligned to come to fruition right around the same time is n't clear			2
but the coincidence of the timing could n't be worse			0
the odds that this prime minister would make decisions on historic issues with the @entity291 before there was clarity on @entity10 's nuclear program were always slim to none			1
for @entity34 , the @entity291 are a long - term challenge ; @entity10 is an imminent , acute problem			1
and a @entity34 who believes the @entity3 are n't taking him seriously on @entity10 is certain to be withholding when it comes to the peace process			1
to satisfy @entity13 requirements , an interim agreement would have to do at least three things : first , avoid doing anything that dismantles the sanctions regime and removes real pressure on @entity10 to cut the final deal ; second , make it impossible for @entity10 to use the next six months to advance in a significant way any of the aspects of its nuclear program -- not just to freeze @entity10 's program but to actually set it back significantly			1
and finally , not to do anything with regard to sanctions that ca n't be reversed			0
all of this may not be possible			0
but in the next 10 days before negotiations with @entity10 resume , everything should be done to try to make certain that @entity339 and @entity296 understand one another and to ensure that there 's as much confidence and trust going forward as possible			2
an orchestrated good cop / bad cop routine between allies could be helpful in negotiating with @entity10			0
a rift that signals the @entity3 and @entity13 are fundamentally out of step is not			2
there are no happy or perfect endings here			0
at best , the choice is between an imperfect interim agreement that buys six months to determine whether @entity10 is prepared to give up its quest for a nuclear weapons capacity or no agreement and an inevitable slide toward military confrontation			2
as of now the @entity3 sees the advantage of the former ; @entity34 does n't			2
the @entity3 has no stake in concluding an agreement with @entity10 that leaves @entity13 angry , aggrieved and vulnerable			1
so , the two sides will find a way to work this through			0
but for now , buckle your seat belts			0
we could be in for one bumpy ride			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity370 .			0

talks between major powers and @entity10 break down but are expected to resume
@entity375 says a key problem is gap between @entity3 and @entity13 on @entity10
@entity13 prime minister @entity34 's world view very different from president @entity253 's , he says
@entity370 : an agreement @entity13 opposes would be *unpopular* in @entity239
