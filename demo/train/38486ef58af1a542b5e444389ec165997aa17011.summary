-- has @entity1 broken ? @entity2 swept the top categories at the @entity4 on sunday night , winning three of the night 's biggest categories			2
but ratings were down sharply from last year			2
the @entity9 telecast delivered 9.5 million viewers and a 3.4 rating on @entity12 , falling 21 percent from 2011 to an all - time low			1
in a way , this performance goes against the ratings trend			1
in recent years , broadcast scripted shows have been on a downward slope thanks to cable and @entity19 , but awards programs have been seemingly immune			0
the working theory is that the more urgency you can create around a telecast , the better the numbers			0
so sporting events , competition reality shows and award shows have often out - performed other types of programming because viewers want to enjoy the immediacy of the event and not get spoiled by headlines revealing the outcome the next day			0
obviously , last night , not so much			0
@entity39 : ' snl 's ' the @entity37 ' sketch is ... @entity12 points out the telecast was up against tough competition from @entity43 's @entity42 and some @entity44 overrun on @entity45 , though sports and music award show audiences do n't typically have a ton of overlap			1
@entity50 ( note : @entity43 ratings are very preliminary due to live sports coverage ; @entity45 ratings are also temporary since @entity44 overrun delayed the network 's entertainment lineup ) : @entity57 adults 18 - 49 ratings total viewers ( +000 ) @entity61 7:00p @entity44 / @entity60 's - 11/18 7p # 20 1.3 3,416 @entity62 # 17t 1.6 3,278 @entity63 simpsons # 8t 2.5 5,185 @entity64 # 15 1.8 3,984 @entity65 # 8t 2.5 5,065 @entity66 dad # 13 2.0 4,161 @entity12 7 - @entity67 - videos # 16 1.7 7,468 8 - 11p american music awards s # 5 3.4 9,471 @entity45 @entity69 # 1 6.1 19,543 @entity44 / 60 minutes # 3 4.9 17,298 @entity63 60 minutes # 6 3.2 14,145 @entity71 / @entity70 # 8t 2.5 11,450 @entity72 # 11 2.2 9,482 @entity73 / good wife # 12 2.1 9,793 @entity74 wife # 17t 1.6 9,645 @entity75 # 17t 1.6 9,383 @entity76 ftb # 14 1.9 6,317 @entity77 # 7 2.7 8,016 @entity78 # 4 4.5 12,751 830 - 11p @entity42 : @entity79 # 2 6.0 15,801 see original story at @entity0			1
