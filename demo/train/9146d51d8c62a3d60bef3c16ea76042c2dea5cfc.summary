editor 's note : @entity2 , a public policy scholar at the @entity3 in @entity4 since 2006 , served in the @entity5 as senior adviser for @entity9 - @entity8 negotiations and in other roles under six secretaries of state			1
he is working on a book about presidential greatness			0
@entity15 says the @entity17 administration is departing from longtime policy on dealing with @entity8			1
@entity4 ( @entity19 ) -- president @entity17 has embarked on what could represent a radical departure in @entity24 's @entity23 policy , at least on settlements			1
having worked for @entity28 and @entity29 administrations , i took it for granted that the current president and secretary of state would first try to invest in @entity8 prime minister @entity33 before publicly confronting him			1
after all , even the toughest secretary of state , @entity34 , who initially had no confidence in the hard - line @entity8 prime minister @entity36 , found common ground with him in an effort to pull off the @entity39 in 1991			1
unlike his two immediate predecessors ( @entity42 and @entity43 ) , the president has decided to draw the line with @entity8 and push for a comprehensive freeze on settlements on the @entity47			1
the president seems unwilling to yield ground and to allow the @entity8 any of the traditional loopholes that would have permitted some settlement construction			2
if the @entity24 - @entity8 brouhaha leads to a real confrontation , even the fall of the @entity33 government , president @entity17 may not feel too bad about it			1
fighting with @entity8 is a normal occupational hazard if you want to be an effective mediator			2
@entity60 , @entity61 and @entity34 knew this			0
but tension with @entity8 was designed with a purpose under prior administrations			2
you did n't pick fights with an @entity8 prime minister because you were frustrated or to make nice with the @entity9 , but to achieve a breakthrough in negotiations that made you , @entity24 and the peace process look good			1
as president @entity17 heads to @entity72 and @entity73 this week , his strategy is not altogether clear			0
the logic appears to be to get @entity8 to freeze settlements , the @entity9 states to offer up partial normalization and together this will somehow get @entity8 and the @entity79 into a successful negotiation on the toughest issues -- @entity82 , borders and refugees			2
the president would presumably be prepared to lay out his own peace plan if necessary			0
to make this work , the sun , moon and the stars would need to align almost perfectly			0
@entity33 has already rejected an airtight freeze on settlements ; the prospect of the @entity9 , already scared of @entity94 , giving visas to @entity8 entrepreneurs is unlikely			1
and the idea that a conflict - ending agreement can be reached between a @entity79 national movement so broken that @entity102 president @entity101 and @entity103 share control over the guns , people and legitimacy of @entity107 , and a right - wing @entity8 government almost seems fantastical			0
i can only conclude that the administration -- filled with talented and experienced people -- understands the long odds , too			0
in fact , both @entity114 chief of staff @entity113 and secretary of state @entity115 have seen the @entity33 movie before ( he was prime minister from 1996 - 1999 ) and may well have advised the president that getting an agreement with him will be almost impossible			2
if the prime minister gave in on a freeze , he would be too weakened in his own country ( without stunning concessions from the @entity9 ) that he could n't go on to do an accord that divides @entity82 and has @entity8 returning to borders very close to those of june 4 , 1967			2
so what 's the administration 's real objective ? certainly , to improve @entity24 credibility and demonstrate its commitment to peace			1
but there is a backstory here that points strongly in the direction of pressing @entity33 either to change his behavior or his government			0
the president and secretary of state have come out early and tough on settlements , and they 're denying @entity8 any wiggle room			1
president @entity17 may be banking on the fact that no @entity8 prime minister can afford a confrontation with @entity24 , particularly with a popular president at a time when @entity8 needs @entity24 to deal with @entity94			1
and the president may also have concluded that if the prime minister decides to hang tough , well , we 'll let the chips and his government fall where they may			0
the problem is the next @entity8 government may be no more willing or able to do what the president and a two - state solution to the @entity8 - @entity79 conflict would demand			0
it 's a risky play so early in his administration			0
i hope the president has thought through the consequences , because what 's left of the peace process depends on it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity2 : @entity24 has shied away from confronting @entity8 prime ministers
he says @entity17 has shown signs of confronting @entity33
@entity2 : the tough stance on settlements is a risky move
he says @entity24 may have decided there 's no chance of peace with @entity33 in office
