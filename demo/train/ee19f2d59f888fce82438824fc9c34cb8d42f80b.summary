that 's the number of goals @entity2 has scored for the @entity4 national soccer team			1
it 's 19 more than the total goals racked up by the no. 2 all - time scorer , @entity9 captain @entity7			1
it 's also one fewer than @entity2 's career assist tally , 58 , which is 36 more setups than @entity14 midfielder @entity13 had in his lengthy career			1
the only major benchmarks where @entity2 is n't tops are shutouts , a statistic designated for goalkeepers and defenders , and caps , or game appearances , a stat in which @entity13 leads @entity2 164 - 156			2
it 's simple math , which is why , to fans casual and ardent , coach @entity27 's decision to leave the orchestrator of 115 goals off the 23 - player @entity9 roster does n't add up			1
the sports world expressed outrage at thursday 's announcement -- and not your typical ho - hum soccer outrage ( they flop ! it 's too low - scoring ! ) , but real , palpable baseball - or football-esque outrage			0
@entity4 , many of them thoughtfully , questioned a personnel decision , like they might question the @entity43 not re-signing @entity44			2
but this is soccer , and @entity4 soccer at that			2
so if @entity27 is honest in saying that his goal is to raise soccer 's profile in the @entity4 , snubbing @entity2 seems to have done the trick			1
now come the questions , the doubts , the monday - morning goalkeepers			0
while some speculated whether @entity2 's age ( 32 ) or perceived lack of heart -- he said in 2012 he was n't sure if he wanted to go to @entity59 and last year went on sabbatical during an arduous @entity9 qualifying campaign -- others simply denounced the decision			1
@entity64 , who coaches @entity2 for @entity66 's @entity65 and also skippered the 2002 and @entity68 squads , told the @entity69 , " if there are 23 better players than @entity2 , then we have a chance to win the @entity9			1
" meanwhile , soccer guru and @entity76 writer @entity75 flatly stated , " cutting @entity2 will prove to be a mistake			2
" not everyone was so diplomatic , as some folks resorted to calling the move shortsighted or the machination of a madman			0
of course , there were a few @entity85 epithets hurled at @entity27 on @entity86 as well ( never mind that he 's a 1996 @entity87 who coached an unheralded @entity90 squad to a third - place 2006 @entity9 finish )			1
more angry barbs were pointed squarely at the youngsters named to the squad -- in particular , @entity94 , 18 , @entity95 , 20 , and @entity96 , 21 , whose combined caps total a whopping six			0
fans also decried the selection of @entity103 , a 32 - year - old @entity66 player who , while wicked with set pieces , at just 14 caps does n't own a resume nearly as shimmering as @entity2 's			1
@entity27 defended his squad -- and @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 -- in a friday press conference , saying , " they might surprise some people			2
" as for @entity2 , @entity27 said other players were " a tiny little bit ahead of him , " and though he did n't want to go into details , he alluded to @entity2 not having the speed and ankle - breaking one - on - one skills he once possessed			1
@entity2 recently acknowledged himself that he struggles to find the motivation to train at 100 %			2
still , @entity27 said at the press conference , @entity2 's a " great passer " with lots of experience			1
@entity2 accepted the decision maturely , saying he was disappointed			2
" regardless , i will be cheering on my friends and teammates this summer , and i remain committed to helping grow soccer in the @entity4 in the years to come , " he wrote on @entity123			0
he has promised to field questions about his omission from the team saturday at the @entity130 in @entity131 , @entity132 , where his @entity65 play			0
if he never took the field again for the @entity135 , @entity2 will have left an indelible mark on the team and its history			1
forget all the goals , assists or the hat tricks against @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144 ( he actually hung four on @entity144 )			0
there are reasons @entity2 has earned a sort of cult fame among @entity4 soccer 's fan base , and notoriety among @entity153 's casual fans			1
he 's one of the primary reasons fans of archrival @entity156 shudder when they hear the chant " dos a cero " ( two to zero )			0
the most glorious dos a cero for @entity4 fans came when @entity2 buried the second goal in the 2002 @entity9 round of 16			1
he scored four goals to lead the men 's national team to a 2007 @entity169 trophy and netted the winner against @entity171 to earn the @entity4 a ticket to the @entity173			2
he donned sunglasses that someone threw at him during a quarterfinal match in the @entity178 quarterfinal , of which he was the inarguable star , and he 's the reason @entity181 fans chanted " @entity182 ! @entity182 ! " after he urinated , yup , on the consecrated pitch of @entity185 's @entity184 in 2003			0
and then there was the 2010 @entity9 game against @entity188			0
with only injury time left , the score 0 - 0 and the @entity4 ' hopes of advancing looking dim if not dead , the @entity4 team launched a lightning counterstrike			2
goalkeeper @entity194 hit @entity2 in stride			0
@entity2 pushed the ball out to striker @entity197 on the wing , who drove into @entity188 's penalty area and attempted to set up @entity7			0
@entity7 's shot caromed off @entity188 's goalkeeper into the path of @entity2 , who buried it for a 1 - 0 win			0
from @entity207 to @entity208 , @entity153 's soccer faithful went nuts			0
how nuts ? this nuts			0
that 's history , however			0
@entity2 would be the first to say he 's not the no. 10 of old			0
he has yet to score in seven games for his club this year , and his performances for the national team have been such that @entity27 pulled him out of a @entity9 qualifier against @entity219 last year and benched him during an april friendly against @entity156			1
but for all the talk about @entity2 's future and questions over whether the curtains have closed on a distinguished international career , @entity27 told the @entity2 - minded reporters at friday 's press conference that much could happen between now and june 16 , when the @entity227 takes on @entity228			1
should , heaven forbid , any of @entity233 's eight midfielders or four forwards suffer an injury in the run - up to the @entity9 , the coach said , @entity2 could be right back in the fold			1
and all this ranting and raving could be for nothing .			0

@entity2 has *57* goals and 58 assists in international career , both @entity4 *records*
coach @entity27 says he left @entity247 off roster because other players are better
for all the *highlights* @entity2 has *amassed* , performances of late have been lacking
if any player on roster is injured before @entity9 , @entity2 could be back , coach says
