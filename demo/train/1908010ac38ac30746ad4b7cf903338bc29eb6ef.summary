when @entity1 moved from his native @entity2 to @entity3 he encountered a problem -- the local pizza was not up to scratch			1
having grown up watching his grandmother make tasty , thin - dough wonders in the oven of her @entity10 apartment , @entity1 was accustomed to a high standard of this universally - loved delicacy			2
so , in spite of being a software engineer rather than a cook , he set out to create his own , mouth - watering pizza			1
" i did a lot of crazy things to make a great pizza at home , " @entity1 says			1
" i 've tried over 100 flours , 100 olive oils , 100 tomatoes			0
i 've sampled 51 different oreganos , " he explains			0
one of the tactics he used was wrapping his oven in aluminum foil in order to get the temperature extra high , and it took him six years and two kitchen fires to perfect his recipe			0
" i 've been a tinkerer since i was a little kid , " says @entity1 , " i 've always liked to experiment with things , i viewed it as a puzzle			2
" engineering quality when he was finally happy with his home - grown formula @entity1 posted the recipe online			1
it went viral and he opened his own pizzeria in @entity3 in 2009			1
the @entity2 is very particular about his product -- he grows his own oregano and uses natural sourdough which is aged for three days for a rich flavour			2
" the style i like is not quite @entity47 , not quite @entity2			2
sort of a hybrid in the middle , but the crust is very , very light , " he says			0
@entity1 says he was passionate about software engineering , his original profession , but it lacked the immediacy of impact that a mouthful of great - tasting tasting pizza has			1
" my software was very complicated , so it was very difficult to explain to people , " he says			0
" pizza is the exact opposite			0
you take one bite and in five seconds you 're excited about it			0
