-- a 32 - year - old @entity2 recruiter for a cosmetology school in @entity4 , @entity5 , accused federal immigration authorities on thursday of throwing him in jail over the weekend as a result of racial profiling			1
" i was just profiled , " @entity10 told @entity0 in a telephone interview			2
the incident began on may 18 , when police showed up at the building housing the school in the suburban @entity4 town of @entity17			0
the school is owned by his mother			0
the building includes a storage area where police found a car that @entity10 said he was storing for a friend -- but which turned out to have been stolen			0
after 48 hours in police custody , @entity10 was interviewed by an @entity28 agent , he said			1
" she did not believe i was @entity2 because of the way i look and the way i talk , " he said			1
" i guess i have a @entity33 accent			0
" on may 20 , he was taken to the @entity34			0
authorities there told his mother , @entity37 , that she could not bail him out because immigration had a hold on him , he said			0
his mother , who is @entity33 , then took her son 's birth certificate to immigration authorities , her son said			0
but immigration officials asked the younger @entity10 to describe his life in @entity2 , a @entity46 commonwealth ; scrutinized the papers brought by his mother ; and came away unpersuaded			1
" last time i was in @entity2 , i was 18 years old , " @entity10 said			1
" i do n't really like @entity2 -- or @entity33			2
" finally , on monday , an @entity28 supervisor allowed him to leave			2
" if it was that simple , why could n't they do it friday ? " @entity10 asked			0
the rev. @entity53 , of @entity54 in @entity4 , has taken up @entity10 's cause			0
" this was based on a clear case of racial profiling and a clear distrust that would not have been extended to a @entity61 or somebody who was @entity63 , " @entity53 told reporters thursday			1
" we have an integral connection between racial profiling and discrimination and the prosecution of our broken racial laws , " he added			1
" it 's everywhere in this country and it 's going to intensify			0
" @entity73 , a lawyer for @entity74 and @entity75 , said he was considering taking legal action against the government on behalf of @entity10			2
that is an example of what we 're facing as we see a broken immigration system that is aimed really at @entity83 and aimed at intimidation and aimed at persecution and aimed at discrimination and ultimately aimed at disempowering the entire community in this country , " @entity73 said			0
in a statement , @entity28 said it " places ' detainers ' or holds on individuals whom we have reason to believe are in the @entity46 in violation of law			1
based upon the evidence initially available on this individual , @entity28 agents placed a detainer on him			1
however , after @entity28 confirmed the individual 's identity as a @entity46 citizen , we immediately canceled the detainer			1
" this individual was held in local law enforcement custody over the weekend on an @entity28 detainer based on initially available information that he was an alien subject to deportation			1
@entity28 took custody of him on monday morning and released him within one hour , after his identity was verified , and the @entity28 detainer was canceled			1
" but that explanation did n't placate @entity73			0
" they 're supposed to be the experts in this and they did n't act like experts , " he said			0
" when it comes to @entity83 , what has happened is they have flipped the coin on its head : the burden of proof now is on them to prove that they are legal , that they are citizens			0
... that is not what @entity46 is about			2
" and @entity28 's defense raised eyebrows from @entity136 , professor of political science at @entity138 in @entity139 , @entity5 , outside @entity4			2
" their defense is only valid if someone is foreign - born , " she said			0
" it 's not a valid defense if someone is asserting that they 're born in the @entity46			2
that 's basically kidnapping and false imprisonment			0
" but such incidents are not unusual , said @entity136 , who went through the files of an immigration and refugee rights project and found that 82 cases -- 1 percent of the total -- involved @entity46 citizens , most of whom had been held for one to three months			2
that would translate to 4,000 of the 400,000 people detained last year by @entity28 , @entity136 said			1
she also tracked 30 cases since 2003 where @entity28 went a step further and deported @entity46 citizens , she said			1
in one case , it took a man wrongfully deported to @entity167 a decade to put together the paperwork to return to the @entity46 , she said .			1

@entity2 detained over the weekend on @entity28 orders
" this was based on a clear case of racial profiling , " his defender says
@entity28 : " we immediately canceled the detainer "
lawyer : " this is not what @entity46 is about "
