in a rare public talk via the @entity3 , fugitive @entity1 leaker @entity0 urged a tech conference audience monday to help " fix " the @entity8 government 's surveillance of its citizens			1
he spoke via teleconference from @entity11 to an audience of thousands at the @entity13 in @entity14			1
the event marked the first time the former @entity1 contractor has directly addressed people in the @entity8 since he fled the country with thousands of secret documents last june			1
in response to a question , @entity0 said he had no regrets about his decision to leak the @entity1 documents , which showed the intelligence agency has conducted secret monitoring of @entity8 ' phone and @entity31 behavior in the name of national security			1
" would i do it again ? absolutely			2
regardless of what happens to me , this is something we had a right to , " he said			0
" i took an oath to support and defend the @entity41			0
and i saw the @entity41 was being violated on a massive scale , " he added , to applause from the 3,000 people in the auditorium at the @entity45			0
" @entity50 and the tech community , the people in the room in @entity14 , they 're the folks who can fix this , " @entity0 said earlier			1
" there 's a political response that needs to occur , but there 's also a tech response that needs to occur			1
" he appeared on video screens with a copy of the @entity8 @entity41 as a backdrop			0
the live stream was slow , repeatedly freezing @entity0 's image onscreen			1
the pair of @entity65 lawyers who hosted the discussion said @entity0 's video , ultimately delivered via @entity68 , was streamed through several routers for security			1
@entity0 also said internet users need more awareness , and better tools , to help them secure their online information from prying eyes			2
while tech geeks may have no problem using encryption tools to scramble their messages or accessing the more - private " deep web " via clients like @entity81 , @entity0 said the average web user should be able to access similar protections			1
" this is something that people have to be able to interact with , and the way we interact with it now is not that good , " he said			0
@entity0 took questions from two moderators -- the @entity65 's @entity92 and @entity93 , his legal counsel -- from the audience , and from @entity95			2
the first , fittingly , came from @entity96 , who created the @entity3 25 years ago this week			0
@entity96 asked @entity0 what he would change about the nation 's surveillance system			2
" we need public oversight ... some way for trusted public figures to advocate for us			0
we need a watchdog that watches @entity105 , because if we 're not informed , we ca n't consent to these ( government ) policies			1
" asked about the difference between government surveillance and snooping by private internet companies , @entity0 said he considers government surveillance more insidious because " the government has the ability to deprive you of rights			2
" @entity0 , a former @entity118 employee and @entity1 contractor who fled the @entity8 after leaking details of the @entity8 government 's spy programs , was granted temporary asylum in @entity11 last year			1
he faces felony charges of espionage and theft of government property in the @entity8 , and he has said he wo n't return until the @entity8 changes its whistleblower protection laws			0
reaction among @entity50 audience members to @entity0 's comments appeared mixed			1
" i think it was right on , " said @entity132 , a retired software entrepreneur from @entity133			0
" there 's always a balance between what the government should know about us and what we would expect to be private			0
" if we 're not constantly protecting that privacy , then we give it up			0
" but @entity142 , a health - care marketer from @entity144 , did n't hear everything she wanted from @entity0			2
" i wanted to hear about what his life is like there ( in @entity11 ) , and whether he 'll ever come back to the @entity8 , " she said			2
" it ( his talk ) was very encryption - heavy			0
" more than 30,000 attendees are currently in @entity14 for the 10 - day sxsw festival , which began friday and wraps on march 16			0
the @entity156 , a nonprofit media organization , live streamed the session			0
also scheduled to speak at the tech - themed conference monday afternoon -- although in person -- was journalist and civil - liberties lawyer @entity161 , who broke the story about @entity0 's leaks of classified @entity1 documents			1
@entity0 's call for developers to create secure , private networks for their users is less of a no - brainer at @entity50 than it may have once been			1
having emerged from the counter-culture of the early web , @entity170 has exploded in recent years as more businesses have sought to tap into successful startups ' millions of users			0
in the same @entity14 convention hall where @entity0 called for new privacy tools , other sessions were helping entrepreneurs learn how to make money with the data they collect about the users of their products .			2

" would i do it again ? absolutely , " @entity0 says of leaking documents
" we need a watchdog that watches @entity105 , " the @entity1 leaker says from @entity11
" there 's a political response that needs to occur , " but also " a tech response "
he speaks via teleconference to @entity50 tech conference in @entity200
