@entity0 -- a former editor for the @entity3 was released without charge friday by @entity6 police hours after he had been taken into custody , but was told to report back to police in october			1
@entity9 was arrested earlier friday in connection with allegations of phone hacking and corruption in a case that promises to be a growing political liability for prime minister @entity16 , whom @entity9 had served as press secretary			1
" i came in today voluntarily as i have been offering to do in the last few months , " @entity9 told reporters outside @entity20 police station			1
" there is an awful lot i would like to say but i ca n't			2
" the newspaper 's former royal correspondent , @entity23 , was also taken into custody friday			1
metropolitan police would not say whether he was released , but implied that was the case			1
in a statement , police said that a 53 - year - old man had been arrested in connection with corruption allegations and was released			1
@entity23 , 53 , had been sentenced to four months in prison in 2007 over the phone hacking			1
another arrest occurred friday night , when police said officers from the @entity38 team had arrested a 63 - year - old man at a residence in @entity41 on suspicion of corruption			1
the team is conducting the phone hacking investigation			1
the scandal has prompted questions over the @entity6 prime minister 's judgment in hiring @entity9 after he resigned as editor of the @entity3 because of the allegations			1
speaking shortly before his former aide 's arrest was announced , @entity16 went on the defensive at a @entity54 news conference friday , saying : " the decision to hire him was mine , and mine alone			1
" he said he gave @entity9 a second chance after receiving assurances that he had not been involved in wrongdoing at the newspaper			1
@entity9 had resigned from the @entity3 after its then - royal editor , @entity23 , and a private investigator , @entity64 , were jailed for intercepting voice - mail messages left for royal aides			1
@entity9 denied knowledge of their activities			1
asked about media reports of a search of the offices of the @entity74 , where @entity23 now works , police said there was an ongoing search of business premises in central @entity0 , but did not confirm that the @entity74 building was involved			1
meanwhile , prosecutors have asked @entity80 in @entity81 to look into allegations of phone hacking and data protection breaches " in light of further emerging developments regarding the @entity3			1
" earlier friday , @entity88 leader @entity87 called on @entity16 to admit the " appalling error of judgment " he had made in hiring @entity9 and to apologize for bringing him into the heart of government			1
@entity16 used his address to call for full inquiries into the phone hacking scandal , urging a broad reform of the press			1
he said the @entity3 turmoil " is not just about journalists on one newspaper , it 's not even just about the press -- it 's also about the police and about how politics works , and politicians too			2
" a fresh start is needed , he said , after decades in which politicians from the @entity88 and @entity108 parties grew too close to the news media			2
" this is a wake - up call , " he said			0
" it 's on my watch that the music has stopped and i 'm saying loud and clear that the relationship has to change in the future			0
" @entity16 also referred to @entity117 , the embattled chief executive of @entity118 and former @entity3 editor who is said to be a friend of @entity16 , saying that he would have accepted her reported offer to resign			2
@entity118 is the parent company of @entity122			0
the prime minister said the full public inquiry into wrongdoing at the paper should be led by a judge to ensure its impartiality , with " no stone left unturned			2
" but it will not begin until after a police investigation into alleged criminal activity has concluded			2
however , he said , a second independent inquiry into " the culture , the practices and the ethics of the @entity6 press " should begin as soon as this summer and look into a new system of regulation			0
the public has been let down by the police , the politicians who represent them and the news media , @entity16 said , and he promised to do everything he can to give people a press that is " clean and trustworthy			2
" on thursday , the @entity3 's parent company , @entity118 , announced that sunday 's edition of the scandal - hit tabloid will be its last			0
the move followed accusations that the @entity3 illegally eavesdropped on the phone messages of murder and terrorist victims , politicians and celebrities , and claims it may have bribed police officers			1
police said thursday they had identified almost 4,000 potential targets of hacking			1
if @entity9 is implicated , the fallout could have damaging consequences for @entity16			1
he is close to current and former top officials at @entity118 , former @entity167 spokesman @entity166 told @entity1 thursday			2
@entity87 said @entity16 must " come clean " about any conversations he may have had with @entity9 about phone hacking , before and after @entity9 was appointed communications chief			1
@entity9 resigned as editor in january 2007 after @entity23 and @entity64 were jailed			1
after he moved to his communications role with the @entity108 , the scandal resurfaced			2
@entity9 was questioned by police in november and resigned from his @entity54 position last january , despite the @entity178 ruling that there was " no admissible evidence " to bring criminal charges			1
@entity87 said the system of self - regulation through the @entity184 has failed			0
he described the press watchdog as a " toothless poodle " in need of reform			0
a new body with more independence is needed , he said , to restore the reputation of @entity6 journalism			0
he also said politicians must take some of the blame for letting the news media gain too much power			0
" for too long , the political class have been too concerned about what people in the press would think and too fearful of speaking out " rather than standing up for the rights of the people , he said			0
and he urged senior executives at @entity118 , including the chairman , @entity204 , to take responsibility for the scandal			0
" i welcome @entity204 's admission of serious errors			0
but closing the @entity3 , possibly to reopen as the @entity209 , is not the answer			0
instead , those who were in charge must take responsibility for what happened			0
" the scandal has heightened debate over a proposed takeover of broadcaster @entity218 by @entity220 , which owns @entity118			0
all are part of the media empire of @entity224 , father of @entity204			0
culture secretary @entity227 will consider the impact of the @entity3 's closure as he reviews its bid for @entity218 , his department said			0
@entity87 joined other members of parliament in expressing concern over the deal , saying it has " significant implications for media ownership in @entity6 " at a time when public confidence in @entity220 executives is low			0
@entity204 said thursday , in announcing the shutdown , that the scandal had " sullied " @entity3 and " has no place in our company			0
" and paying out - of - court settlements to some victims was " wrong and a matter of serious regret , " he said			0
the paper 's roughly 200 employees are now out of jobs , but are free to apply for other positions within @entity118 , the company said			2
the layoffs have angered union representatives			0
on wednesday , @entity224 called allegations against his flagship sunday paper " deplorable and unacceptable			2
" @entity3 was the first @entity6 national newspaper @entity224 bought , in 1969 , as he began to propel himself from @entity261 newspaper proprietor to international media magnate			0
in addition to owning @entity3 , @entity118 owns the @entity209 , the @entity264 and the @entity265 in @entity6			0
@entity204 's @entity220 also encompasses @entity266 , the @entity267 , the @entity268 and @entity270 publishers			0
@entity1 's @entity271 , @entity272 and @entity273 contributed to this report .			2
