-- next to @entity1 , the musical surprise of the 2013 holiday shopping season so far is the limited @entity4 release of " @entity5			1
" it 's a potential gold - mine excavation : fifty - nine previously obscure tracks , unknown outside the subculture of obsessive collectors			1
over on the bookshelves , the recently published first volume of biographer @entity13 's three - part " @entity10 : all these years " takes up considerable space			1
titled " @entity16 , " the first book offers 944 pages on the iconic group , concluding in 1962 -- before they were famous			1
beyond serving as baby boomer stocking stuffers , do these kinds of archaeological digs enhance the @entity10 ' legacy ? or is pop - culture nostalgia starting to scrape the bottom of the barrel ? never officially released and mostly known to hard - core collectors , the actual music on the " @entity29 " consists of outtakes , live versions and two demos of songs the @entity10 wrote for other artists			1
the motivation for its release is complex , extending beyond immediate sales considerations			1
due to a recent @entity42 ruling , the copyright to this material would expire in 2014 if it remained unreleased			2
so the sudden appearance of " bootleg " on the marketplace may in part be a legal ploy for @entity48 , the company the @entity10 began in 1968			2
but is there a sizable -- even insatiable -- audience for every bit of the scraps and marginalia of @entity54 ? overall , the numbers are somewhat surprising			2
turns out the @entity10 are still doing major business			2
in fact , recent profits suggest their customers ca n't only be co-members of the boomers ' aging demographic			0
according to @entity68 , the two surviving members and the estates of @entity66 and @entity67 together and individually earned roughly $ 71 million in 2013 from record sales , royalties , merchandise and licensing			0
earlier this year , the @entity74 trade publication @entity75 reported the @entity10 ' @entity76 turned over 43.5 million pounds in 2013 , an improvement of 2 million pounds over 2012			2
while archival releases are only drops in this plentiful bucket , the long - defunct group 's persistent popularity serves as a lifeboat for the perpetually struggling music retail business			1
the " @entity29 " ( and " @entity16 " ) could put @entity85 ' devotion to the test , however			0
ten years in the research and writing , @entity13 's doorstop tome has been hailed as a labor of love -- and digression			0
the author 's minute attention to detail matches the microscopic focus of " @entity97 , " where the only arguable revelations are at best minor finds : @entity66 's roughly sung demo tracks of two songs , " @entity100 " and " i 'm in @entity103 , " later recorded by , respectively , @entity104 and the @entity105			0
it 's hard to imagine the retrieved versions replacing the originals in anyone 's affections , but casual fans should be entranced by the behind - the curtains glimpses into the early @entity10 working process			1
even without producer @entity119 's finishing polish , the group 's signature high energy and unstoppable melodies come through loud and clear			0
and in the absence of true surprises , there are plenty of eyebrow - raising moments such as two spunky versions of " one after 909 " ( eventually rerecorded on the " @entity127 " album )			0
@entity48 may be protecting the @entity10 brand by releasing these curios and preventing further substandard bootleg releases , but even fans may question the wisdom of serving up every leftover and prototype			0
on the other hand , the latest ( @entity138 ) entry in @entity140 's " @entity139 " came out this year to near - universal acclaim			1
" @entity147 ( 1968 - 1970 ) " retrieves obscurities and alternate versions from one of @entity140 's most difficult periods			1
a bit of thoughtful pruning makes this unearthed archival treasure something more than another clearance sale			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity155 .			0

@entity155 : " @entity29 , " a release of obscure @entity10 tracks , is a holiday surprise
he says group still earns millions and release may be tied to extending copyright
with new 944 - page book , too , he asks if @entity54 is scraping dregs of barrel ?
@entity155 : some leftovers can be *appetizing* such as @entity140 's recent " @entity139 " release
