-- family musical groups are as common as cowboy boots at the @entity3			2
the @entity4 joins a long list that includes the @entity6 , the @entity7 , the @entity8 , even the @entity9			1
still , fans have an endless fascination with how these groups operate in such close quarters , perhaps because so many of us have memories of bickering with our own siblings over @entity19 trucks and dress - up bins			1
" we 've had to go against nature a bit , " @entity4 admitted with a laugh			1
" but honestly , i 'm not sure how people do it without their family			2
" the three siblings -- @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 -- have been performing together for 14 years			1
the band is a democracy , they said , but their mom holds two votes and plays referee			2
it 's a system that has worked wonders so far			2
in october 2010 , the group released " @entity40 , " a single that , ironically , given the title , brought @entity4 to life			1
the song reached no. 1 on the country charts , headed over to the pop charts and went quadruple platinum after selling more than 4 million copies			2
since then they 've released three more hits -- " @entity52 , " " @entity53 " and the latest , " postcard from @entity55			1
" " the most nerve - racking moment was releasing ' you lie , ' " @entity29 said of the band 's success since the first single			0
" it was like , ' great , we 're not a one - hit wonder band			0
' " in 2011 the band won both the @entity65 and the @entity67 's new artist of the year awards , as well as the 2011 @entity67 award for single of the year			0
this summer they 're traveling with @entity72 on his " @entity74 " tour and promoting the @entity76 program , an initiative aimed at providing meals for food banks across the country			1
the siblings are from a small town , @entity83 , @entity84 , that was badly damaged by the tornadoes that hit the @entity86 last april			1
" so many of the families were struggling financially anyway , the food bank really helped them get back on their feet , " @entity29 said			1
" so this [ program ] is really near and dear to our hearts			2
" @entity29 , 28 , is the talker of the group			2
@entity31 , 23 , and @entity30 , 21 , speak only when they can get a word in edgewise			0
they 're songwriters , first and foremost			0
" we write in a writing circle , " @entity30 said			0
" @entity31 's on the base guitar , i 'm on my mandolin ... it 's like there 's a pot in the middle and we 're all throwing stuff in			0
" touring with @entity72 can be tricky			1
he 's known to be a prankster -- spraying opening acts with water , throwing bread rolls on stage and even decorating @entity115 's tour bus			0
" we do have to sleep with one eye open when we 're out on the road , " @entity29 said			0
so far it has been only psychological warfare : @entity72 peppered a concert venue in @entity120 with a photo of the band , using a head shot of @entity124 to replace @entity31			1
but the band is ready for anything			0
they 've stashed @entity129 guns and silly string in cases on stage			0
@entity134 parties are actually becoming more legendary than his pranks , @entity31 said			1
@entity72 brought a petting zoo with miniature ponies to one show			1
he recently rented a theater for a private viewing of " @entity141			0
" " he 's a great guy to be out on the road with , " @entity29 said			0
" it 's a grueling schedule and he 's one of the best at keeping it lighthearted			0
" the @entity4 is headed back to the studio to record their second album			1
faced with pressure to duplicate the success of their first , the @entity148 are trying to remember that they 've been doing this for years -- and will continue to play after the spotlights fade .			0

the @entity4 has four hits , including " @entity40 " and " @entity156 "
the siblings are promoting the @entity76 program to help stock food banks
touring with @entity72 is a *mix* of parties and pranks , the group says
