@entity0 -- global warming could destabilize " struggling and poor " countries around the world , prompting mass migrations and creating breeding grounds for terrorists , the chairman of the @entity4 told @entity5 on wednesday			1
climate change could increase flooding in coastal areas , like the flooding that hit the @entity15			1
climate change " will aggravate existing problems such as poverty , social tensions , environmental degradation , ineffectual leadership and weak political institutions , " @entity16 said			1
" all of this threatens the domestic stability of a number of @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity28 countries			0
" people are likely to flee destabilized countries , and some may turn to terrorism , he said			0
" the conditions exacerbated by the effects of climate change could increase the pool of potential recruits into terrorist activity , " he said			1
" economic refugees will perceive additional reasons to flee their homes because of harsher climates , " @entity16 predicted			0
that will put pressure on countries receiving refugees , many of which " will have neither the resources nor interest to host these climate migrants , " he said in testimony to the @entity55			0
reactions to the report broke down along partisan lines , with @entity59 generally praising it and @entity61 expressing doubts			0
committee members had concerns about the report 's secrecy , reliability and use of intelligence resources			2
global warming may have a slight positive effect on the @entity72 , since it is likely to produce larger farming yields , @entity16 said but it is also likely to result in storm surges that could affect nuclear facilities and oil refineries near coasts , water shortages in the @entity82 and longer summers with more wildfires , the study found			1
international migration may also help spread disease , @entity16 added , and climate change could put stress on international trade in essential commodities			1
" the @entity72 depends on a smooth - functioning international system ensuring the flow of trade and market access to critical raw materials , such as oil and gas , and security for its allies and partners			2
climate change and climate change policies could affect all of these , " he warned , " with significant geopolitical consequences			1
" the report was the conclusion of the most comprehensive government analysis the @entity72 intelligence community has ever conducted on climate change			1
@entity16 emphasized that it could make no hard and fast predictions , saying that the operative word in his assessment was " may			0
" wealthy countries will be able to handle the situation better than poorer ones , he said			0
" we assess that no country will be immune to the effects of climate change , but some will be able to cope more effectively than others , " he said			1
" most of the struggling and poor states that will suffer adverse impacts to their potential and economic security are in @entity128 , the @entity129 , and @entity28 and @entity130			0
" however , the spillover -- from potentially increased migration and water - related disputes -- could have a harmful global impact , " he added			0
@entity16 painted a mixed picture of the effects of climate change on the @entity72 itself			1
" most studies suggest the @entity72 as a whole will enjoy modest economic benefits over the next few decades , largely due to the increased crop yields , " he said			2
" costs begin to mount thereafter , however , and some parts of the @entity72 -- particularly built - up coastal areas -- will be at greater risk of extreme weather events and potentially high costs related to losses in complex infrastructure			2
" the impact of fighting and preparing for climate change may be greater than the effect of global warming itself , @entity16 said			1
" government , business and public efforts to develop mitigation and adaptation strategies to deal with climate change -- from policies to reduce greenhouse gases to plans to reduce exposure to climate change or capitalize on potential impacts -- may affect @entity72 national security interests even more than the physical impacts of climate change itself , " he said			1
the report , the " @entity177 on the @entity178 to 2030 , " relied on @entity72 government , military , academic and @entity175 studies of climate change			1
the report itself is classified , which some members of the @entity182 objected to			2
" i am disappointed it is classified , " said rep. @entity184 , @entity185			0
secrecy " prevents this report from being released and discussed in public domain			0
" @entity55 chairman @entity189 , a @entity191 @entity190 , said he would ask the administration to declassify it			0
@entity189 opened the hearing by saying " human beings all over the planet face death or damage or injury if we do not act			0
" he blasted the @entity201 stance on climate change , saying , " the @entity204 administration continues to limit what their experts know			1
the president does n't want @entity72 to know the real risk of global warming			1
" republicans on the committee criticized the report as wasteful , with rep. @entity213 of @entity185 calling it a " dangerous diversion of intelligence resources			2
" rep. @entity216 , @entity217 , said that the report was unreliable and that its authors admitted as much			0
" we have a lot of information where we are incapable of assessing it , " @entity16 conceded			0
@entity216 also questioned the committee 's priorities			0
" there are a lot more pressing issues out there for the intelligence community to be focused on right now that would help keep @entity72 safe , " he said			2
the assessment " was a waste of time , a waste of resources for the intelligence community to be focused on this issue versus other folks in the government that could have done this job and have a responsibility for doing it			0
" @entity16 said the intelligence community had relied on the science of others because it did not itself monitor climate change			1
he said the assessment was based on midrange predictions of global warming .			2

climate change could destabilize " weak " states , intelligence chair says
global warming could spark mass migrations , classified report finds
@entity72 food production could increase with climate change , report suggests
but it says @entity72 coasts could be threatened by larger storm surges
