@entity0 -- @entity2 and two @entity4 screeners will pay $ 240,000 to settle an @entity7 man 's claim he was denied access to a flight until he covered a t - shirt that read in @entity11 and @entity12 , " we will not be @entity14			1
" @entity2 and two @entity4 screeners settled a lawsuit for $ 240,000 , but denied any wrongdoing			1
in the settlement , @entity2 and the @entity4 screeners deny any wrongdoing , saying they only wanted to resolve the 2½ - year - old federal lawsuit			1
but @entity22 , an @entity7 who immigrated to the @entity24 three years ago , cast the settlement as a victory , saying the payout would discourage airlines and airport security officials from imposing restrictions in the future			1
@entity32 attorney @entity31 , who represented @entity22 , also called it a victory			1
" a $ 240,000 award should send a clear and strong message to all @entity4 officials and to all airlines that what happened here is wrong and should not happen again , " he said			2
the @entity4 screeners -- @entity41 and @entity42 -- declined comment , referring questions to their attorneys , who also declined comment , and the @entity4			1
@entity4 spokesman @entity47 , while noting that the @entity4 was not a party to the suit , said " there is absolutely no intention to take disciplinary action against the employees involved			0
" the incident occurred august 12 , 2006 -- two days after the @entity55 revealed a plot to bomb planes to the @entity24 had been foiled			0
in response , the @entity24 imposed a ban on carry - on liquids , and raised the threat level at airports			1
@entity22 , now 30 , said he was attempting to travel on @entity2 flight 101 from @entity65 's @entity64 to @entity66 , @entity67 , when he was approached by @entity4 officers			1
the officers told him he 'd have to cover his t - shirt			0
" when i asked why , one of the @entity4 officers said , ' coming into an airport while wearing a t - shirt with @entity12 letters on it was equivalent to going into a bank while wearing a shirt saying , ' i am a robber , ' " @entity22 said			1
@entity22 said he originally refused to cover up the shirt , first asking to speak to a supervisor , and asking if there was a law prohibiting @entity12 shirts			0
" i said , ' i think as a @entity24 resident and taxpayer , i think it 's my constitutional right [ to express myself ] , ' " said @entity22 , adding the t - shirt 's message was not threatening			1
@entity22 said he finally relented when it became obvious he could n't get on the plane without complying			0
the officials purchased a t - shirt for him to wear , he said			0
" they had actually a discussion in front of me			0
one said , ' let 's buy an " i [ heart ] @entity65 " shirt			0
' and another said , ' no , we ca n't take him from one extreme to another			0
' " " i said , ' what makes you assume that i do n't love @entity65 ? ' " @entity22 said they eventually bought him a " generic gray " t - shirt with the words " @entity65 " on it			2
" they tried to say this is a compromise ... i said , ' it is not a compromise , you are denying me my rights , ' " @entity22 said			0
airline officials also changed his seats without consulting him , forcing him to to sit in the back where flight attendants kept an eye on him , @entity22 claims			0
according to court documents , @entity4 screener @entity42 said he remembers @entity41 telling @entity22 he " had perhaps not made the best choice of clothing " given the events two days earlier			1
but " at no point in time did he ever request or order that the passenger change his shirt or suggest that his failure to do so " would keep him off the flight			0
@entity22 said he is disappointed the @entity4 and airline did not apologize to him			1
in a written statement to @entity1 , @entity2 said it was pleased with the settlement			2
" the settlement amount represents a fraction of the amount originally sought by mr. @entity22 , " spokesman @entity135 said			2
" @entity2 continues to deny , outright , every critical aspect of mr. @entity22 's version of events			1
" " at no time did anyone from @entity2 ever say he could not board the aircraft unless he changed his t - shirt , " @entity135 said			2
@entity32 attorney @entity31 said @entity22 did not sue @entity4 directly because of " legal considerations			1
" " it 's much more difficult to sue a government agency than it is to sue the direct government employee that committed the unconstitutional act , " he said			0
but the @entity2 settlement should accomplish the same goal , he said			2
" it 's very difficult to bring these kinds of cases and to prevail on these kinds of cases , especially in a post 9/11 world in which airline officials and government officials have been given an extreme amount of latitude , " @entity31 said			0
@entity22 said the slogan on the t - shirt -- " we will not be silent " -- originated in @entity169 as a campaign against the @entity172 repression			2
he said artists in @entity65 have printed it in various languages .			0
