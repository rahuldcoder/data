-- smartphones are powerful tools , and with the right apps and accessories , they can become even more so			0
a @entity6 - based tech company has launched a tool that turns a regular @entity8 or 4s into a powerful biometrics scanning tool			1
@entity10 has unveiled its app and a wrap - around device for turning the smartphone into a portable iris , face , fingerprint and voice scanner			1
the hardware and software system , the first of its kind for the @entity8 , is called @entity22 , which comprises both the @entity25 app â € ” which will cost $ 199 â € ” and a wrap around device for an @entity8 or @entity28			1
the app uses the @entity8 camera to snap pictures of faces and record voices , while there 's an extra camera that does iris scanning and a small sensor to scan fingerprints			1
@entity39 will also release a software development kit to its customers so they can customize the app to their own needs			2
in february , the @entity44 paid @entity39 $ 3 million to develop an enhanced solution using the tool that 's being launched today			2

think of a border protection agency that could use iris recognition at an airport 's customs checkpoint , or a police or law enforcement agency that needs to verify identities on the go and ca n't afford large , cumbersome hardware to do so			1
that 's where @entity22 comes in			1
making the system work on an @entity8 makes everything easier			2
" if you used an @entity8 before , you can use this , " said @entity10 's director of product marketing @entity65			2
in a teleconference demonstration , @entity65 showed how the system works			0
the user inserts the @entity8 in the device , plugging it in using the 30 - pin connector , and then launches the app. the app interface is user - friendly and simple , and lets the user register the biometrics of the person in front of him with relative ease			1
using an @entity8 also lets the app register gps coordinates and transmit all the data through the phone 's mobile internet connection			1
the app is designed to help the user determine the distance at which to stand in front of the other person and automatically takes a picture when the subject is in the right range			0
this automatic capture works both with the @entity8 camera and with the built - in iris scanner			1
all pictures taken are stored and easily accessible within the app. the app allows the user to create a person 's profile including his or her iris , face , voice , fingerprints and biographical information			1
this trove of data is then accessible with the tap of a finger			0

but they eventually settled on the @entity8 for various reasons			2
" it is very secure as a platform , which is , naturally , important to our customers , " he said			0
" [ it is ] very stable , you can buy the same device globally			0
they have a very strong ecosystem for supporting accessories like the one we created			0
" @entity65 declined to say how much the device costs , stressing the fact that it is not a consumer product but , rather , it is intended for companies or government agencies			0
@entity22 could be used at border crossings , during disaster relief operations ( when regular infrastructure for identity verification is n't present ) , for remote mobile banking or even remote healthcare			1
countries like @entity150 , which is deploying national @entity152 programs to give every citizen a unique number linked to biometric data ( @entity156 ) , could also be target customers			0

@entity65 declined to identify specific customers who have already bought @entity175 , but said that the first shipments will be at the end of april			0

@entity6 tech company launches biometric app and scanning tool for @entity8
the @entity22 is packed with **technology** which can scan face , iris , fingerprint and voice .
developers hope police , border agencies and airport customs authorities could all *benefit* from the **technology**
