president @entity0 still has a long way to go to secure congressional authorization for military action against @entity4 even after clearing a key hurdle in the @entity6			1
according to @entity8 , there are 18 " no " votes in the @entity6 and 24 " yes			0
" fifty - eight senators -- almost the same number of votes needed to overcome any filibuster -- remain undecided			1
after changing an @entity0 - sponsored proposal authorizing a military response to alleged chemical weapons use by @entity4 , the @entity14 voted on wednesday to approve it by a 10 - 7 margin			1
the outcome set up debate next week in the full chamber			0
@entity8 vote count : how the @entity6 will vote @entity24 three @entity25 -- sen. @entity26 of @entity27 , sen. @entity28 of @entity27 and sen. @entity29 of @entity30 -- voted in favor of taking action			1
and that 's where the good news ends for the @entity24			1
@entity0 needs at least 217 votes in the @entity24 to secure his resolution			1
in that chamber , there are nearly four " no " votes for every " yes " at the moment			0
according to @entity8 's count , 109 members plan to vote " no , " while 23 -- including a number of high profile @entity25 -- plan to back it			1
more than 280 representatives remain undecided			0
of concern to the administration is a trend showing an increase in " no " votes , although lawmakers remain out of town until next week and many have yet to receive classified briefings where the administration says it can spell out more evidence and more candidly answer questions			0
rep. @entity62 , chairman of the @entity63 , rep. @entity60 and rep. @entity61 are among those who have come out against the plan			0
rep. @entity66 , a @entity67 @entity25 , signaled through a spokesman on wednesday that she was planning to vote " yes			1
" but the same official said on thursday that she wanted to first see the resolution language and was now undecided			0
those decisions put those lawmakers at odds with their leadership since house speaker @entity75 and majority leader @entity76 have backed @entity0			2
@entity75 has said it is up to the @entity24 to get the votes			2
@entity24 @entity79 , too , have reservations about @entity4			1
many , especially liberals , cite war weariness and prolonged intervention in @entity84 and @entity85 as reasons to oppose new military action			0
others want to hear more details in classified meetings or see resolution language , which in the @entity6 would limit any strike , set a time limit for action , and prohibit the use of @entity97 troops in @entity4			2
" after 6,668 @entity97 troop deaths and tens of thousands of @entity97 wounded , after spending $ 2 trillion in @entity84 and @entity85 representing $ 40,000 in debt for every @entity97 family , now is the time to nation - build in @entity97 and invest in the growth of the @entity97 economy , " @entity99 rep. @entity98 , a @entity100 , said in a statement to @entity8			0
despite the vocal opposition in @entity109 , @entity0 remained confident he 'd get the necessary support			0
" i believe @entity109 will approve it because i think @entity97 recognizes that as difficult as it is to take any military action and even one as limited as we are talking about , even one without boots on the ground , that 's a sober decision , " he said at a news conference on wednesday in @entity112 .			2

most senators undecided on how they *'ll* vote on @entity4
in the @entity24 , there are nearly four " no " votes for every member voting " yes "
despite @entity24 @entity25 leadership 's call for approval , not a done deal among rank and file
@entity134 also a trouble spot for @entity0 , who is calling for limited action
