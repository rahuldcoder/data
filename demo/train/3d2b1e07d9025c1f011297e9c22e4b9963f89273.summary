@entity0 -- @entity2 has launched a rocket it hopes will allow it to join an elite group of space explorers to @entity7			2
the country 's space research organization ( @entity8 ) launched its orbiter to the @entity7 on tuesday -- only @entity11 , the @entity12 and the @entity13 have previously been successful in operating probes from @entity7			1
@entity15 made an attempt with the @entity18 orbiter in 1998 but it failed to reach the planet and a @entity21 probe was lost along with the @entity24 @entity23 mission in january 2012			0
the @entity27 's @entity26 probe separated from the @entity29 's @entity28 in 2003 but nothing was ever heard from the lander			0
it will take 10 months for @entity2 's @entity33 to reach the @entity7 after lifting off from the @entity34 near @entity35			1
the probe will explore the planet 's surface features , minerals and atmosphere			1
@entity8 is hoping to discover more about the loss of water from @entity7 , map the sources of methane gas , as well as collecting data about the two moons @entity47 and @entity48			2
but @entity8 chairman @entity49 told @entity1 that one of the biggest technological challenges was just getting there			1
many missions have failed to reach the planet while others have crashed on the surface or contact has been lost before the probes could send back data			0
@entity2 's space program launched its first @entity61 satellite in 1975 and put an unmanned probe into orbit around the @entity64 in 2008			2
it plans to launch its own manned spaceflight in 2016 , though an @entity2 cosmonaut , @entity67 , flew aboard a @entity69 space mission in 1984			0
the @entity70 is aiming to build on the success of a series of robots that have roamed the surface of the @entity7 when it launches its own orbiter mission called @entity76 -- @entity76 spacecraft -- scheduled to launch on november 18			1
the @entity29 is working with the @entity24 on an @entity79 rover that is due to start its mission in 2018			0
but private companies are also proposing trips to the @entity7 -- and some of them are only one - way			0
the @entity86 project wants to colonize @entity61 's neighbor , beginning in 2022 and the @entity88 wants to launch a man and a woman on a 501 - day round - trip in 2018 without ever touching down			0
is @entity2 's @entity7 mission fueling @entity94 space race ? explore @entity7 discoveries with @entity1 's interactive map more on future @entity7 missions @entity1 @entity7 full coverage			1

only @entity11 , the @entity12 and @entity13 have succeeded with @entity7 probes
@entity2 's spacecraft will explore the planet 's surface features , minerals and atmosphere
@entity8 chairman @entity49 says one of the biggest technological challenges is just getting there
@entity11 is due to launch its @entity76 probe to @entity7 later in november
