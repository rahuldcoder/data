-- as recently as 2011 , @entity1 was seen by many as a respected but polarizing figure : smart and accomplished , sure , but controlled and somewhat humorless			1
in the infamous faint praise of her rival - turned - boss @entity6 , she was " likable enough			2
" three years later , she seems somehow hipper , looser and more ... human			2
as we inch toward the 2016 election , she 's presented a new online persona			2
while @entity13 has embraced social media , it has n't always loved her back , as seen most recently on her current book tour			1
the @entity16 has used every opportunity to turn her words and actions into memes , not all of them flattering			2
so what happened ? how did @entity1 suddenly go viral ? you can trace the change back to october 18 , 2011 , when then - secretary of state @entity13 was traveling with her staff on a c - 17 military plane from @entity28 to @entity29 , @entity30			1
nobody knew its importance at the time , but that 's the day @entity35 ' @entity34 and @entity37 's @entity36 snapped a handful of photos that would soon become iconic : @entity13 , in oversize black shades and a no - nonsense expression , checking her @entity43 at a makeshift desk as staffers mingled behind her			1
" okay , nice image i thought , but we were about to land in @entity29 which was certain to yield the images that the world would really want to see , " @entity34 wrote in a blog post months later			2
" photographers , you never really know when your pictures will resurface and what use they will be to someone out there			2
" 5 things to watch in @entity1 town hall texts from @entity1 you know the rest			1
six months later , the photos were all over the @entity16 , thanks to two journalists with an idea that started as a joke at a bar			0
in april 2012 , @entity68 and @entity69 launched a blog , texts from @entity1 , that showed fictional text - message exchanges between @entity13 , from her seat on the plane , and a range of celebrities			1
there she was rejecting a @entity79 friend request , telling a flirty @entity80 to call her " madame secretary , " blowing off @entity86 by saying she 's already booked on @entity82 and responding to @entity6 's " @entity83 , whatchu doing ? " with " running the world			0
" as the perfect vessels for deadpan mockery in the social media age , the posts and related @entity88 feed soon were everywhere			1
within days , @entity13 invited @entity68 and @entity69 to her office at the @entity93 , where she initiated a group photo of the trio texting on their phones			1
although its makers shuttered the blog only a week later -- " once you meet the subject of your meme ... it 's very hard to top that , " @entity69 told @entity0 -- @entity13 's image was altered almost overnight			1
" during the 2008 @entity107 primary , @entity6 had a lock on young people , technology chic and the press			0
@entity1 was regarded by kids as the lady who 'd been around a long time , wearing headbands and pantsuits , " @entity112 wrote that week in the @entity113			1
" now she 's quick to laugh at herself and take advantage of the positive buzz , " @entity112 continued			0
building a brand on @entity88 a few months after @entity13 stepped down as secretary of state in early 2013 , she joined @entity88			1
her first tweet thanked @entity68 and @entity69 for the inspiration and then said , " i 'll take it from here ... # tweetsfromhillary			0
" it was retweeted more than 10,000 times			0
and her @entity88 bio became an instant classic of the form			1
it reads : " wife , mom , lawyer , women & kids advocate , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , author , dog owner , hair icon , pantsuit aficionado , glass ceiling cracker , @entity147 ... " soon @entity13 was posting childhood photos of husband @entity157 on his birthday , tributes to the @entity149 , a portrait of her with members of @entity153 band @entity152 and pleas for such pet causes as elephant poaching and empowering women in the developing world			1
" she has really embraced the platform in the right way			0
she has humanized herself and her brand , " said @entity165 , ceo of the @entity166			0
" today , participating in digital media is n't a choice , " @entity168 added			2
" your digital footprint is created regardless of your participation , and any smart politician knows that it is best to help curate that image vs. leaving others to define it for you			0
" @entity13 also has shown flashes of self - mocking humor , as when she tweeted a joke during the @entity184 in february about how she enjoyed watching " someone else being blitzed and sacked " on @entity185 for a change			1
today , @entity13 , 66 , has 1.5 million @entity88 followers , many who may not even remember her eight years in the @entity190			1
at least for now , she seems more comfortable in her skin -- witness the photos of her wearing thick glasses and almost no makeup -- although that may change if she runs for president again			0
the @entity16 is n't always nice but getting the attention of the @entity16 is not always a good thing			0
anything @entity13 says has the potential to go viral , for worse as well as better			1
in january 2013 , @entity13 was fighting back criticism before the @entity202 during a hearing about the attack on the @entity206 mission in @entity207 , @entity30			1
" with all due respect , the fact is we had four dead @entity206 , " she said			0
" was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night decided they 'd go kill some @entity206 ? what difference , at this point , does it make ? it is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again , senator			0
" the twitter - sphere quickly seized on the outburst , and within hours , # @entity226 was trending			0
not only did the hashtag spread , but so did a graphic of @entity13 's 2008 campaign sign juxtaposed with the phrase " what difference does it make ? " earlier this month , as she promoted her new book , " @entity234 , " @entity13 was trending again in an interview with @entity237 's @entity236 , @entity13 said she and former president @entity13 were " dead broke " and " struggled to piece together the resources " for mortgages in pricey @entity240 and the @entity242 suburbs along with their daughter @entity244 's tuition at @entity246			1
@entity13 sought to clarify her comment , saying simply that she and her husband have known periods in their lives when they struggled to pay off debt , but the damage was done			1
her @entity88 critics turned # @entity255 into a mocking hashtag			2
once and future candidate ? criticism aside , should @entity13 run for president in the 2016 election , digital - branding experts believe the reborn , tech - savvy @entity13 will resonate better with voters , especially young ones			1
marketing guru @entity264 believes the old @entity13 hid her personality behind the security wall of public service			2
the new @entity13 is undergoing a swift digital makeover , said @entity264 , ceo of @entity269			2
" how can she modernize , and fast ? get online and exude an ageless hipster style that takes away the pain of the proximity between her age and the age of @entity276 ( 69 ) when he took office , " @entity264 told @entity0			0
" the sudden burst of intellectual energy , even in 140 characters , reinforces she is of these times and living the now			0
" @entity264 believes @entity13 must be her authentic self on social media to appear more relatable to voters			1
" she needs humor and self awareness -- we do n't want mrs. @entity291 , " she said , referring to the sometimes imperious former @entity286 prime minister			0
" she needs to be of the people , and with them			0
" it ca n't hurt to keep posting more personal messages such as her " my most exciting title yet : grandmother - to - be ! " tweet congratulating @entity244 and husband @entity299 on expecting their first child			0
@entity168 , of the @entity166 , believes @entity13 still wants to be president and has realized " she can no longer sit on the sidelines " when it comes to digital media			1
" i believe it has helped her garner many new fans and will continue to play a huge role in building her brand , " @entity168 told @entity0			0
" the last time ms. @entity1 had presidential aspirations , there was n't a strong sense of her as a person			2
the public had a very one dimensional image			0
" using digital media in this way allows her to present a fuller ... more human picture			2
if she does decide to run , it could be a decisive factor			0
" @entity0 's @entity320 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 has *increased* her presence on social media
her *rebirth* can be traced to the " texts from @entity1 " meme in 2012
@entity13 also has proven to be a savvy user of @entity88
but social media cuts both ways and can *amplify* any *missteps*
