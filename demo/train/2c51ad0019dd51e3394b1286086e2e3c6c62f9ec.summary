-- if ethical shopping has a star , it 's @entity4 , the celebrity eco-stylist who champions green consumerism from the pages of @entity7 , where he 's editor - at - large , as well as his books and tv appearances			1
@entity4 's way : promoting a green lifestlye as fun and accessible for all			1
he 's helped many of @entity17 's big hitters become more green , and been dubbed " the new @entity23 " for his enthusiasm , positivity and his practical approach to making our lives more environmentally friendly			1
" think big , " he advises			1
" do n't worry over the small things			2
if you drive a lot , invest in a hybrid			2
if you 're renovating a house , invest in a super-efficient heating and cooling system			2
new floors ? think recycled nylon carpets made from old carpets ( like @entity37 flooring 's @entity35 material )			2
one big statement really counts			1
" he believes that being green does n't have to be hard work and that we can all make a difference , while living stylish , comfortable lives			1
@entity4 's eco credentials were there from the start -- he was actually born on @entity48 ( april 22 ) -- and he started trying to change the world at a prodigiously early age			1
he started an environmental group when he was 12 , which grew into a national organization			2
he wrote his first book at 19			2
when reporters from the @entity55 were interviewing him about another topic and noticed his well - decorated eco apartment , suddenly he became a green lifestyle expert			1
but while he does n't believe we need to give up shopping to save the planet -- far from it , that new flat screen tv you crave might actually use less energy than the tube version you already have -- he does believe that we should change the way we shop			2
" we should be thoughtful consumers , " says @entity4			1
" at the end of the day , we need things in our everyday life : groceries , clothes , cleaning products , transportation			2
i think we need to stop shopping as a weekend activity or as something to do when ' bored			2
' instead , making purchases when you need to can lead to a more responsible form of shopping			0
" if a refrigerator breaks and you ca n't repair it , then do n't you need to buy a new one ? why not get the most energy efficient model you can find ... that 's a win - win scenario			0
" the cheaper and better option despite the upscale image of many stylish , environmentally - friendly products - and the perceived high cost of organic food -- @entity4 firmly believes that going eco does n't have to be expensive			1
" a @entity93 organic cotton t - shirt			0
yes , it will be expensive , " he says			0
" but @entity93 has always been expensive			0
a @entity96 organic cotton t - shirt can also be bought for just $ 15			0
it all depends where you shop			0
" for people who complain that hybrid cars are too expensive , why not look at used cars ? i found a @entity104 with only 10,000 miles on it for about 40 percent off the sticker price			0
" because green issues are becoming much more a part of the public consciousness , big brands are " greening " their products and eco choices are becoming much more widely available - making it much easier for ordinary consumers to make the switch			1
" about ten years ago , it was tough , " he says			0
" you had to order your recycled paper toilet paper via catalogue ! today , it 's a lot easier to find everyday green products in stores all over the country			1
there 's a huge demand for quality , well - made , stylish eco-friendly products			0
my work with @entity96 proves that going green has gone to the mainstream			1
" you can buy method non-toxic cleaning products in stores like @entity137 , @entity138 and even @entity140 stores			0
and all the mainstream grocery store chains carry a wide variety of organic foods ... even generic food has gone organic ! " all of which means we are seeing a new generation of ecologically - aware shoppers			1
but they are not , as you might imagine , the young , early adopters			0
" i get emails everyday from people asking , ' where can i find a green version of this or that			1
' and it 's from people you 'd never expect : my parents ' generation			1
" when i saw a @entity161 hand soap sitting on my parents ' kitchen counter , i knew things have changed			0
" for @entity4 , the key to successfully moving what was a marginal concern into the mainstream is showing people that the less polluting , less wasteful option does n't have to be a pious choice -- it can actually be easier , cheaper and just as stylish as well			1
" in my world , i do it with beautiful photos , inspiring text , and how - to information , " he says			0
" my books are full - color , gorgeous and fun			0
my tv segments are instructional , but solutions - oriented ... not gloom and doom			0
and i make it easy with online resources , simple web clicks and right - to - the - point answers			0
no wasted time ! "			0
