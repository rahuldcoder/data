editor 's note : @entity2 is @entity3 and professor of law , policy and society at @entity7 in @entity8			1
@entity9 has written 16 books , including " @entity11 : understanding @entity12 and @entity13 " and is writing a book on school violence and security			2
@entity2 says perpetrators of mass shootings usually do not suddenly go berserk			1
( @entity19 ) -- massacre / suicide has become an all too familiar sight on the electronic pages of this and other news sites			0
but tuesday 's rampage in @entity26 , @entity27 -- with a body count reaching to the double digits -- forces us to struggle mightily in search of plausible explanations and effective solutions			1
what could have prompted 28 - year - old @entity35 to shoot to death his mother , grandmother , uncle , cousin and six others -- some of whom appear just to have been in the worst place at the worst time -- before turning the gun on himself ? mayor @entity47 summarized the collective bewilderment in @entity26 in the immediate aftermath of the bloodshed			0
" i do n't think anybody has any idea of what the motive is , " he said			1
in just over a few moments of horror , this rural community of a couple thousand residents that had n't had a single homicide in well over a decade , based on @entity59 crime reports , now had a multitude of questions about the will to kill			1
" apparently something just snapped , " speculated @entity65 , mayor of @entity66 , @entity27 , the community just outside @entity26 where @entity68 ended his own life after a police chase			1
because @entity68 chose suicide , the complete truth to his motivation may never be known			0
but from what can be learned from countless similar episodes in @entity78 and abroad , the crime may not be so unfathomable after all contrary to the widely held belief of " snap judgment , " perpetrators of mass murder -- and family annihilation in particular -- generally do not suddenly go berserk			1
if he was like most others who have walked in his shoes , @entity68 would have contemplated his actions for some period of time , surely more than the few moments it took to load his assault rifle			0
with a list of enemies and a large arsenal , his planning would probably have reflected calm deliberation and cool determination			0
in decades of research in collaboration with my @entity7 colleague @entity101 , certain common characteristics of mass killers emerge time and time again			1
first , the perpetrators tend to have experienced a long history of frustration and failure , resulting in a diminished ability to cope with life 's disappointments			0
second , they typically externalize blame , frequently complaining that others did n't give them a decent chance			2
without this , their destructiveness would instead be directed inward			0
in addition , these killers generally lack emotional support from friends or family			1
they are loners as well as losers			0
lacking this support system and reality check , they come to perceive some precipitating event as being absolutely catastrophic			1
this most often involves some kind of major disappointment : the loss of a job , the breakup of a relationship or financial ruin , surely a major issue in today 's economy			0
finally , they need access to a weapon powerful and rapid enough to satisfy their intense need for revenge			0
without much hope for a brighter tomorrow , these assailants often decide that life is not worth living ; rather than just taking their own life in quiet solitude , they are eager for payback			0
it becomes their all - consuming mission to avenge , with a death penalty , against those who caused them to suffer -- in reality or perhaps only in their paranoid interpretation of events			0
experiencing disappointment and failure so profound as to extinguish their desire to survive , most mass killers deliberately and methodically execute those closest to them , those they hold responsible for their troubles			1
there is little surprise , therefore , that mass murder overwhelmingly involves family members or co-workers , not total strangers			2
although there certainly are many well - known episodes of random slaughter of complete strangers , these are more the exception than the rule			0
in the wake of extraordinary shooting sprees like the @entity27 tragedy , calls for tighter gun control typically surface as a possible policy response for prevention			2
yet the mass shooting just hours later and thousands of miles away in rural @entity189 , where gun limits are stricter than in the @entity78 , reminds us that any debate must confront questions broader than just guns , even if the use of a high - powered firearm tends to increase the victim toll			1
regrettably , there are no simple fixes nor any means for reliably identifying mass killers before they act , despite the consistent profile			1
there are tens of thousands of @entity78 who would fit the mold , yet , fortunately , very few of them decide literally to take matters and guns into their own hands the best we can do , in terms of public policy and hometown approach , is to reach out to those around us who appear to be struggling emotionally or financially and offer friendship , compassion and understanding			0
at the end of the day , our efforts may not eliminate the risk of mass murder or necessarily deter the next @entity35 from turning his community into a personal battle zone , but at least we can enhance the well - being of countless citizens in the process of trying			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : @entity27 and @entity189 shootings raise questions about motive
*evidence* in many cases shows killers do n't suddenly go berserk , he says
@entity2 says mass killers react after losses and lack social support system
he says they blame others , rather than themselves , for their failures
