@entity0 , @entity1 -- former @entity1 leader @entity3 initially rejected a colostomy procedure when he fell ill in 2006 , putting his own life at risk , according to an unnamed medical source quoted by @entity9 diplomats in cables released by @entity11			1
the cables were made available by the @entity13 newspaper @entity12 thursday			2
in one cable dated march 16 , 2007 , almost eight months after @entity3 was forced to cede power to his younger brother , the head of the @entity9 diplomatic mission quotes unnamed sources as saying the elder @entity3 fell ill on a short domestic flight after a long day of giving speeches			1
" they had to land urgently once they knew of his bleeding , " the cable says			0
" he was diagnosed with diverticulitis of the colon			2
" four of the five diplomatic missives were sent from the @entity29 in @entity0			0
the @entity9 does not have formal diplomatic relations with @entity1			0
@entity3 's health has long been considered a state secret , and for months there was wild speculation about his illness			1
but by the time the march cable was written , it was widely believed that he was suffering from diverticulitis			0
the same cable quotes an unnamed medical source as saying that @entity3 " wo n't die immediately , but will progressively lose his faculties and become ever more debilitated until he dies			2
" the author of the cable , @entity9 diplomat @entity45 , adds , " we are missing too many variables to be able to predict accurately how many more months @entity3 will live			2
" more than three years later , @entity3 is alive and well			2
he has not resumed power , but he began to appear fairly regularly in public in july to deliver speeches on global affairs , particularly about his fear of a looming nuclear war			0
the cable also says that it was @entity3 himself who initially rejected a colostomy , a procedure in which one end of the large intestine is surgically cut and brought outside the body through the abdomen			1
a bag attached to the opening collects waste			0
the decision was backed by @entity3 's main doctor , the cable said , but opposed by the rest of the medical team			1
" @entity3 , capriciously , did not permit the colostomy , " the missive said			1
diverticulitis is the swelling of pouches in the lining of the intestine that are formed as a result of abnormal pressure in the colon			0
a colostomy is sometimes recommended in the treatment of diverticulitis if the colon wall is perforated or if an abscess is formed			1
instead , the cables said , @entity3 chose to undergo an operation to remove the infected part of the colon and splice it back together			1
" with the passage of time , as the colon was infected , the operation collapsed and the reattached part separated			0
they had to operate again , but found a fistula , " according to the cable			0
a fistula is an abnormal connection between two separate parts inside that body that can occur due to inflammation , injury or infection , according to the @entity104			0
@entity3 himself has since said that he was on death 's door and had to undergo various operations because the first one did n't work .			1

the decision risked @entity3 's life , the cables say
the cables were published by @entity11
a colostomy is sometimes recommended to treat diverticulitis
