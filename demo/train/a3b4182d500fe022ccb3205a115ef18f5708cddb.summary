the little boy looks barely old enough to walk , let alone understand the dark world he 's now inhabiting			1
he should be toddling around a playground with his friends			0
but instead , he wears a black balaclava , crouched down in a desolate street with his tiny hands clenched around an @entity8			0
he pulls the trigger and the recoil of the shot knocks him back , his limbs unable to control the rifle			0
an adult takes the weapon from the boy 's hands as he stands up and steps away , casting a blank glance into the camera			1
it 's just one of the many videos that @entity22 -- the @entity23 terror group that has declared an independent @entity25 state stretching from northern @entity26 to central @entity27 -- has produced to boast of its youngest " recruits			1
" and as the radical @entity31 group strengthens its hold on this huge swath of land in the heart of the @entity36 , it is cramming its warped ideas into minds that are often too young to understand			0
@entity39 , whose name has been changed out of fears for his safety , was one of them			0
he has now fled to safety in @entity45 , but was just 13 when @entity22 said he should attend one of their children 's camps in northern @entity26			1
" my friends and i were studying at the mosque , and they taught us that we should enrol in jihad with the [ @entity53 ] , " @entity39 told @entity1			1
" i wanted to go , but my father did not allow me to			2
" when @entity22 found out that @entity39 's father had prevented him from attending , the militants sent a patrol to their house			1
" [ they told me ] ' if you prevent @entity39 from coming to the camp , we will cut off your head , ' " his father , who declined to be named for this story , told @entity1			1
so off @entity39 went to the camp			2
" for 30 days we woke up and jogged , had breakfast , then learned the @entity67 and the @entity68 , " @entity39 says			0
" then we took courses on weapons , kalashnikovs and other light military stuff			0
" some of the militants at the camp were kind , joking and laughing with the younger recruits			2
others made the boys watch hideous things			0
" they used to bring young [ kids ] to the camp to lash them , " @entity39 says			2
" when we go to the mosque , they order us to come the next day at a specific time and place to [ watch ] heads cut off , lashings or stonings			2
" " we saw a young man who did not fast for @entity88 , so they crucified him for three days , and we saw a woman being stoned [ to death ] because she committed adultery			0
" @entity39 says he understood some of the lessons taught at the camp -- like the importance of prayer and fasting -- but did n't understand words like " infidels , " and why he should fight them			2
the boys would take oaths of allegiance to @entity22 ' leader , @entity104 , and were considered ready to fight once they completed the religious and military courses taught at the camp			1
@entity39 's father , terrified for his son , tried to visit him several times , but was turned back by guards who told him that the boy was n't there , or on patrol somewhere else			1
" he is only a child , they might make him a suicide bomber and [ convince him ] that will be in paradise and stuff like that , " he said			0
despite his fears , @entity39 's father expressed doubt that the militants ' lessons would truly stick in his son 's mind			1
" how can a child like that be convinced ? where is the conviction in that ? he is a child , it 's not possible , " he said			2
" he just saw his friends and kids his age went to the camp , so he wanted to go with them for entertainment			0
they thought war and guns were entertainment			0
" @entity39 's father was eventually able to pull him out of the camp , and the family fled to @entity45			1
now @entity39 does n't know what to do			0
he does n't want to go back to school -- he thinks he 's too old for that now -- and thinks he might like to learn the trade his father practiced before they were forced to flee their home , fearful of what @entity22 militants would make him do			1
@entity39 says one of his friends at the camp has been killed on the front lines of @entity22 ' war with more moderate rebel groups fighting to topple the regime of @entity26 president @entity161			1
" he was martyred in @entity163 when he fought the @entity164 with @entity22 , " @entity39 says			2
" he was my age , 13 or 14 years old			0
" @entity22 may preach absolute fealty to @entity25 , but @entity39 does n't recognize the militants ' message in his own understanding of his religion			1
" i love my religion because i am a @entity172 , " he said			0
" and i used to go with my father for the prayers before @entity22 came			2
but my father has taught me that religion is not about fighting , but it is about love and forgiveness			0
" @entity39 and his family are safe now			0
but as @entity22 spreads its tentacles across the region , an increasing number of @entity26 have nowhere to hide -- and the group 's murderous drive to convert everyone they encounter knows no age limits			1
