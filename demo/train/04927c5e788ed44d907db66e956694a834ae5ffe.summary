-- i would love to say my dog is intellectually qualified to be a service animal			1
there 's barely enough brainpower there to be a lamp			1
in fact , @entity10 's only apparent skills appear to be power napping and somehow reaching unspeakable parts of his body with his tongue			1
which , to be fair , is definitely a skill , though not one that easily lends itself to helping humans			0
" there 's a little boy stuck in the well ! @entity23 , @entity10 , molest yourself for 20 minutes ! " alas , being a true service animal requires something special			1
and even some of the very brightest dogs , those with the best training in the world , never quite live up to their potential			0
and that 's exactly what happened to @entity35 , a golden @entity36 who was supposed to become a guide dog			1
if it was n't for those damn cats			1
that was @entity35 's weakness			1
just could n't lay off the cats			2
thus , @entity35 never graduated to calmly lead blind people across the street , for fear that he might actually lead blind people across a tree			0
but it turns out he had another calling			0
taxi became a seizure alert dog , for 14 - year - old @entity53 of @entity54 , @entity55			1
when @entity53 was born , she had an abnormality on the right side of her brain that caused epileptic seizures			1
for the first several years of her life she was mostly nonverbal and could n't eat solid food			2
when she turned 6 , however , two corrective surgeries greatly reduced the frequency of her seizures and allowed her to start developing new skills			0
then , four years ago , @entity35 came into her life			0
ever since , they 've been inseparable ; he even joins her at school			2
and this year , @entity35 finally got his own picture in the yearbook			1
that was a big talker all over the @entity72 this week			0
when @entity53 takes taxi with her to school , he 's there to warn of oncoming seizures and to also assist her in the event of one actually happening			1
but mostly he just lays around , not participating in anything remotely educational			0
so , in a lot of ways , his accomplishments in school are slightly more impressive than mine			2
unless you count occupying space and disrupting others			0
but there was just something about that photo			2
when @entity35 's big , serious face appeared in the @entity95 yearbook and hit the @entity72 , people just could n't resist			1
just to the right of @entity53			1
and just to the left of : @entity101			0
( @entity101 , welcome to @entity103 fame by association			0
now 's a good time to drop your new rap lp			2
) anyway , it 's a well - deserved addition			1
@entity53 's mom had joked about @entity35 's exclusion the previous year , so this time they got it right			1
and , if nothing else , @entity35 's newfound @entity103 fame has added an interesting bit of education about seizure alert dogs			1
@entity53 's family can share several incidents where , somehow , @entity35 just knew			1
conversely , sometimes i drop food on the kitchen floor and @entity10 literally has no idea			0
he 'll be just steps away			0
" @entity10 , there is literally free food on the floor			0
it 's bacon , stupid			2
" taxi would be all over that			2
now , it 's worth noting that the @entity138 is n't fully convinced that seizure - predicting dogs do exactly as some people believe			1
they believe the bulk of this evidence is mostly anecdotal			0
so , they warn people to exercise caution when considering this type of canine service			0
either way , there 's something special about @entity35			2
multiple times he 's warned others about oncoming seizures			2
he 's always right there on @entity53 's left side because that 's the direction she falls			1
and @entity35 knows to position himself there so he can protect her from slamming into the ground			0
again , just for comparison , i could be on fire and @entity10 would be completely preoccupied , lording over his @entity164 in the backyard where he 's waged a full - scale yet poorly strategized border war with @entity168 , the wiener dog next door			1
so , clearly , @entity35 is special and has earned his place in the yearbook			0
and just left of @entity173 follow @ @entity174 on @entity175			0
see more content with questionable news value at @entity178 .			0

taxi is a seizure alert dog who did n't quite make it as a guide dog
he helps 14 - year - old @entity53 of @entity54
taxi finally got his own photo in @entity53 's *middle* school yearbook
