-- @entity1 have rejected out of hand a formal offer from @entity4 for their talismanic captain @entity5 , the @entity7 club confirmed on wednesday			1
the @entity9 champions officially launched their bid to re-sign the 23 - year - old earlier in the day when director general @entity12 told reporters an offer had been made			1
fabregas came through the youth ranks at the @entity17 before joining @entity1 in 2003 , and declared last month he would like to return to @entity19			1
the midfielder then backtracked by saying that he would put his future in the hands of @entity1 manager @entity23 and instead focus on playing for @entity19 at the @entity24 in @entity25			2
but @entity1 met @entity4 's offer with a curt response			1
a statement on their official web site read : " @entity1 captain @entity5 is under contract with the club until the summer of 2015			1
he is a highly valued member of the team and part of our future plans			0
" we have followed recent speculation linking @entity5 with a move away from the @entity42 but as there has never been any official approach for him , only two informal exchanges , in which we made it abundantly clear that we have no interest in transferring @entity5 , we have refrained from publicly passing comment			2
" however , yesterday evening we received an offer from @entity4 for @entity5 and in response , we immediately and resolutely told them once again that we have no intention of selling our captain			1
" to be clear , we will not make any kind of counterproposal or enter into any discussion			0
@entity4 have publicly stated that they will respect our position and we expect that they will keep their word			0
" @entity55 had earlier told reporters during a presentation of the club 's latest sponsorship deal : " everybody knows that @entity5 wants to sign for @entity4 and that we also want him to come here , but there is also a third party involved -- @entity1			1
" any agreement has to be with them			0
the official window for transfer negotiations opened on june 1 , and although we 'd had unofficial conversations with them before yesterday , we 've now made a formal written offer , which we presented to @entity1 yesterday afternoon			1
" @entity4 vice-president @entity70 said that director of football @entity71 and director @entity73 were leading the negotiations			0
" i 'm optimistic that he 'll be able to sign for @entity4 as soon as possible , and it 's clear that everybody here will give him a warm welcome , " @entity70 said in quotes on the @entity4 web site			2
" we 'll do nothing that might make it more difficult for him to come here , and we wo n't rush things -- but we wo n't stop either ! " meanwhile , @entity70 also played down reports that last summer 's marquee signing @entity88 would be leaving @entity4 after a disappointing first season in @entity19			2
the recent signing of @entity19 striker @entity91 from @entity92 for $ 49 million has put the @entity95 international 's @entity17 future under some scrutiny			0
" there is no problem with @entity88			0
he 's happy and i hope he 'll be here scoring goals as he did last season for many years to come			0
there 's nothing to say other than that we are very satisfied with him , " @entity70 said .			0
