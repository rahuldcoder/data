-- the @entity1 has given @entity2 another year to prove it 's doing enough to protect the @entity3 or suffer the humiliation of having it enter the list of sites in danger			1
the country has been scrambling to ensure adequate measures are in place after a damning review of the reef 's health and safety at the last committee meeting in 2013			1
the @entity1 said on wednesday it is still concerned about planned coastal developments , including planned new ports and liquified natural gas facilities			1
however , @entity22 director @entity21 said in a statement , " @entity24 is confident the overall direction towards next year 's decision is a positive one			0
" @entity2 environment minister @entity28 declared the year delay " a positive outcome for @entity2 and we can be proud of our achievements in protecting the @entity3			1
" @entity32 in biodiversity stretching 2,000 kilometers down the coast of the state of @entity36 , the @entity3 boasts the greatest biodiversity of any @entity38			1
it 's home to hundreds of species of coral , fish , bird and mollusks , but also runs along a busy coastline lined with farms , towns and beaches that attract millions of tourists each year			0
conservationists say not enough is being done to protect the region from the burden of business interests , particularly a planned coal port at @entity55 , near the city of @entity57			0
" the first step must be to immediately ban the dumping of dredge spoil in the @entity3			2
dredging and dumping for new port developments pollutes @entity3 waters , and the majority of @entity2 want to see an end to this outdated practice , " said the @entity62 's @entity2 reef campaigner @entity61			1
in a report released in april , @entity24 " noted with concern " proposals to dump three million cubic meters of dredge spoil inside the @entity38 from the @entity55 site			2
it said it also " regrets " the approval for the dredge spoil to be dumped " prior to ( the government ) having undertaken a comprehensive assessment of alternative and potentially less impacting development and disposal options			0
" in a statement following the @entity1 's extension of the deadline on wednesday , minister @entity28 defended the decision , saying the approval of the @entity55 development " complied with @entity2 's obligations under the @entity38 , was subject to rigorous environmental assessment and applied @entity2 's world - leading net benefit approach			1
" ' years of neglect ' the degradation of the @entity3 has been occurring for decades , according to scientific reports and anecdotal evidence			2
in a speech on tuesday in @entity96 , actor and director @entity94 declared he 'd seen the " devastation " firsthand			0
" what once had looked like an endless underwater utopia is now riddled with bleached coral reefs and massive dead zones , " he said , comparing his experience diving on the @entity3 20 years ago to a dive at the same location two years ago			2
the same year , in 2012 , the then environment minister @entity106 admitted that years of neglect had contributed to a sharp drop in the reef 's coral coverage			2
" there 's no doubt there 's been a level of neglect for decades which if it had been dealt with otherwise we 'd be in a much better situation now , " @entity106 told the @entity111 , at the time			0
he was responding to a report from the @entity121 ( @entity122 ) and the @entity123 that the reef had lost half of its coral cover in the last 27 years			0
most of the damage was inflicted by tropical cyclones , the report concluded , as well as coral predation by the crown - of - thorns starfish and coral bleaching , mostly caused by warmer water			1
battered by cyclones images released this week by the @entity137 show the devastating effects of @entity139 , a category five tropical cyclone , which hit the region in april			0
before and after images show colorful coral snapped and flattened by waves whipped by fierce winds , which smash reefs , especially those not far from the surface			0
" there is a myriad of increasing and cumulative impacts on the @entity3			2
we can control impacts such as fishing , coastal development and marine debris			1
however we do not have the same control over storms and cyclones , " said @entity157 , @entity137 's chief scientist			0
" ensuring that our coral can bounce back from these disturbances is at the heart of the matter , " he said			0
the government says it 's " absolutely committed " to protecting the @entity3 and is spending around $ 180 million dollars each year to improve the reef 's health			1
however , it remains to be seen whether it 's enough to protect what the environment minister has in the past called a " vast and priceless ecosystem			0
" @entity175 military jettisons bombs near @entity2 's @entity3 ' game - changing ' cameras capture beauty and fragility of reef life			1

@entity1 gives @entity2 another year to address issues with @entity3
committee has warned it may be added to danger list
reef suffering effects of *weather* events , coastal development , crown - of - thorns starfish
boasts the greatest biodiversity of any @entity38
