while all eyes are on @entity5 's health , the former @entity2 leader 's legacy is gaining ground in an unlikely place			1
on saturday , at a soccer stadium in the north - east of @entity13 , the 94 - year - old 's messages of peace and equality will be given center stage during a @entity16 match involving one of the world 's biggest clubs			1
however , it is not @entity21 that will be promoting its own " @entity35 " and lending its efforts to the anti-racism campaign gathering force around @entity25 -- but rather its host @entity34 , a team battling to keep its place in the @entity13 top flight , and one that is committed to making an impact in one of football 's emerging markets			1
@entity36 was one of the directors responsible for spearheading @entity21 's drive into @entity39 and @entity40 in the late 1990s , and now he is guiding one of the @entity16 's less glamorous teams into a region that is actively seeking investment -- @entity2			1
" there 's so many similarities -- a growing economy , new wealth forming , the people love football , " he told @entity45 ahead of a match which will be the club 's first big public statement about its work with @entity5 's foundation			1
while governing bodies , football associations and clubs search for an effective response to the problem of racism , @entity34 is pursuing a more active approach			2
television viewers around the world , including an estimated 1.2 billion in @entity2 who watch @entity16 games , will see @entity5 's messages on a big screen that would otherwise show commercials			1
there will be tv commentary in @entity72 , @entity36 said			0
players will warm up in @entity77 t - shirts , its flag will be displayed by the pitch and drummers from @entity80 will entertain the crowd , who will be asked to donate to the @entity2 charity			0
on the surface it may seem like an advertising gimmick , but @entity36 says @entity34 is serious about its involvement with @entity5 's group and about its relationship with @entity2			1
" we have links with academies in @entity92 and the @entity93 but nothing like this			0
our whole focus is now @entity2 , " the club 's marketing director said			2
it happened almost by chance			0
having been approached in 2011 by the " @entity109 " initiative started by the @entity104 company , which was impressed by @entity34 's @entity106 program for kids in the community , a two - year shirt sponsorship deal followed last june			1
" it opened our eyes to this huge continent who 's screaming out , ' we love football , we love the @entity16 , ' " @entity36 said			1
it led to further interest from @entity2 businesses , and link - ups with clubs in @entity121 , @entity2 and @entity122			0
" the @entity5 conversations took place following that , " @entity36 said			2
" we had read about the foundation and legacy program			2
what made us contact them was that this whole racism problem started popping its head up again in @entity25 football and it was unhealthy			0
" of course , @entity5 is the torchbearer of equality and racism issues , and we felt that as a club working in @entity2 would it not be an idea to see if there was anything we could do , utilize him and support him in that message			1
" before deciding on the partnership , its first with a major sporting organization , @entity5 's foundation staff visited @entity34 to see its community program , which works with more than 40,000 young people and their families each year			1
it plays a vital role in a region which has been hit hard in recent decades by economic recession and the demise of its coal mining and shipbuilding industries			0
@entity34 's present stadium is actually situated on the former site of the region 's last coal mine			2
now owned by @entity161 billionaire @entity160 , the club -- formed by school teachers back in 1879 -- is a focal point for the locals			0
" they are the most genuine , down - to - earth folk that you 'll ever meet in the @entity170			0
i 'm an outsider who 's come in but i feel it 's a very friendly community , " said @entity36 , an @entity171			0
" if you play for the club you 're a hero to them			0
" @entity34 's links with " @entity5 " go further than his foundation -- @entity36 recently discovered that one of the club 's fans was an activist with the @entity181 when @entity5 was in prison			1
" he ended up becoming a @entity184 supervisor when @entity5 got out and was actually at the stadium when he was released ( in 1990 )			2
it 's an amazing story , " @entity36 said			0
beyond promoting @entity5 's key legacy objectives , @entity34 can also expect to do significant business , according to @entity104 's chief executive @entity189			1
" @entity34 will become the @entity16 club in @entity2 , " @entity189 said when the shirt sponsorship deal was announced			1
" everybody will be wearing the @entity34 shirt , every kid in every school will want a @entity34 shirt which says ' invest in @entity2 , ' believe me			1
it will be the number one club			0
" that sounds fanciful given the popularity of top @entity16 clubs such as @entity21 , @entity201 , @entity202 and @entity203 , who have all fielded top @entity2 players , but @entity36 has high hopes			1
" if you 've got @entity2 written on your shirt and you 're promoting the continent and you 're in the @entity16 , definitely without question it highlights you , " he said			2
" the @entity16 , as an entity , is almost bigger than @entity21 , @entity203 , @entity202 -- every team involved down to the lowest fan base , they get massive exposure			1
people are aware of who they are			0
" a few years back people might not have known about @entity221 -- now everyone knows that there is a @entity221 and they play @entity21 twice a year			2
" @entity34 's own profile has been raised by the presence of prominent @entity170 politician @entity226 on its board , where he is vice-chairman			2
@entity226 plans to continue his role at the club despite deciding to move to the @entity161 , where he will work for the @entity231 -- a humanitarian relief and development organization			0
@entity226 , a former foreign secretary in @entity170 's previous @entity235 government , played a key role in establishing @entity34 's @entity2 interests			2
" he was out at the foundation last week in @entity2 talking to over a hundred leading personalities in @entity2 about how we will support the program , " @entity36 said			0
@entity34 will undertake a preseason tour of @entity2 in july , based around @entity5 's birthday on the 18th of that month , and @entity36 said the players would be actively involved with the foundation 's programs -- which the club has agreed to support for the next three years			1
" i 'm over there almost every month now in parts of @entity2 , " @entity36 said			0
" people want to talk to us , they are genuinely interested in the fact that we 've linked with football clubs			0
we 've got fulltime staff working in @entity2 , we 're proactive , we 're not just going out for a preseason tour and disappearing			0
