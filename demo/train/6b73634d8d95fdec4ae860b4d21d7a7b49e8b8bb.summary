-- when one of the @entity4 's four giant funnels collapsed , @entity1 saw his father @entity5 killed in front of him			1
grief stricken but with his survival instinct still intact , the 21 - year - old dived into the icy waters of the @entity11 to take his chances and swim for his life			0
the cold was almost paralyzing and many poor souls perished almost immediately , but @entity1 was made of stern stuff and managed to pull himself into a collapsible lifeboat			1
with others desperately clamoring to get on board , it was almost waist deep in water and the cold proved almost unbearable for the occupants			0
many died before they were helped , initially by another more stable lifeboat and then by the liner @entity27 , a haven for so many titanic survivors			1
a little distance away , @entity30 sat shivering , huddled in one of the last lifeboats to leave the stricken super liner -- which had been heralded as " unsinkable " ahead of her maiden voyage from the @entity38 port of @entity39 on april 10 , 1912			1
next to him was @entity41 , a fellow passenger on their first - class journey who was later to be his wife			0
in the same lifeboat was the @entity4 's owner , @entity47 , who had embarked on the journey with his reputation never higher , but was later to be vilified for allegedly deserting his ship			0
amputation threat it took nearly six long hours for the lifeboats and the 706 survivors to be reached , by which time @entity1 had lost all feeling in his legs , which had turned purple with frostbite and lack of circulation			1
the ship doctor on the @entity27 warned him that they were so far gone that amputation was the likely outcome			1
but @entity1 could not conceive this possibility and took about literally walking his legs back to life , relentlessly pacing the decks on the journey to @entity71 -- two hours at a time , despite the intense discomfort			1
it was during this time that he met @entity30 for the first time			1
@entity77 is recorded of their exchanges , but from memoirs it is reported that at 26 , the elder man was " very helpful " to @entity1			1
aside from their shared survival of one of the greatest maritime tragedies in history , where over 1,500 passengers and crew perished , they had one other thing in common			0
both were to become members in the @entity94 , having been on - court rivals and later @entity97 teammates for the @entity98			1
and both were to be central figures in two books which have been published around the 100th anniversary of the 1912 tragedy			0
rival books like so much associated with the @entity4 in the many books and films on the subject , controversy and disagreement over what actually happened is never far from the surface			0
first came " @entity112 at midnight , " written by @entity30 's granddaughter @entity113 and published last year			1
former @entity98 @entity97 team press officer @entity114 commissioned @entity116 screenwriter @entity115 to write a " factional " account for his @entity119 publishing firm -- " titanic : the @entity121 , " which came out this month			1
@entity122 , who is published by @entity123 , stuck more or less strictly to memoirs and historical records , although a small passage in her book is also fictional			0
@entity114 , who has published books on great players such as @entity131 , believes the tale to be the " greatest story in the history of tennis " but allowed the 45 - year - old @entity115 some leeway in developing characters and themes			2
he compares the treatment to that of the @entity141 winning film " @entity149 " about @entity38 track and field runners @entity144 and @entity145 where fact merged with fiction to dramatize the story			0
however , @entity150 is aghast at the portrayal of her grandfather and @entity1			2
the 62 - year - old , who is known as @entity155 , is deeply protective of the memory of her forebear			0
" the ' other ' book is truly appalling , " she told @entity0			0
" @entity1 and @entity30 were wonderful , dignified men , who would never have exhibited the characteristics that are displayed			1
" if @entity30 and @entity1 were here right now they would be incensed and absolutely miserable at how they took their lives and created something out of fiction			1
" @entity115 stands by her writings : " i 'm proud of what i did , which was based around a lot of research by @entity114			0
" " @entity115 is a very good writer , " conceded @entity122			0
" but the saddest part is she did n't honor the truth at all			0
" with both books competing for sales , there is no sign the row will settle down , but what is not disputed is how the lives of the two men became intertwined in the aftermath of the tragedy			0
remarkable recovery @entity1 made a remarkable recovery and less than three months later he faced the more experienced @entity30 in a tennis tournament on the lawns of @entity187 in @entity188			1
@entity1 raced into a two - set lead , but the wily @entity30 prevailed in five sets			1
legend has it that their shared experience on the @entity4 was never mentioned by the two fellow @entity195			0
@entity1 was on the rise and won the @entity197 ( now known as the @entity198 ) , beating @entity30 in the quarterfinals			1
both were in the 1914 @entity98 @entity97 team , with @entity30 as a reserve			1
further success followed for @entity1 in the 1916 @entity98 @entity204 before serving in the @entity98 army in @entity206 , being decorated for valor			1
resuming his career after the hostilities , @entity1 enjoyed major success in doubles competition in the @entity97 and grand slams			1
his crowning glory came aged 33 at the @entity214 , where he partnered @entity215 to the gold medal in the mixed doubles -- the last time the event was part of the @entity220			1
the pair remain the reigning @entity223 champions as mixed doubles will be reintroduced at @entity225 , with the likes of @entity227 and @entity228 coveting the gold			1
@entity1 became a successful banker in @entity231 and died aged 77 in 1968			2
@entity30 's story was more complex and the events of april 14 , 1912 left an indelible mark on his psyche as he suffered from " survivor 's guilt			2
" as both his granddaughter and @entity115 touch on in their accounts , the circumstances under which he ended in a lifeboat with women and children has come under scrutiny , particularly as the reviled @entity47 was also an occupant			0
honor at stake @entity122 said that her grandfather was in the " right place at the right time " as the first - class passengers were shown to the lifeboats , at first more as precaution because it was widely believed that the @entity4 was " unsinkable			0
" according to our research , @entity30 was very honorable , " he said			2
as boat no. 5 was lowered , @entity47 was imploring passengers into the craft and was asked by a lady passenger " if the men could join us			0
" he replied in the affirmative and @entity30 climbed aboard			2
in @entity115 ' book , a smitten @entity30 proposes to @entity41 while in the lifeboat -- poetic license , indeed			2
@entity122 recounts that they actually waited eight months to announce their engagement			0
" they feared a backlash from being titanic survivors , " she said			2
@entity30 's sense of duty intensified as @entity206 started in @entity275 and he became a leading campaigner for @entity98 involvement working alongside former president @entity278			1
as @entity122 recounts , @entity30 organized the @entity279 in @entity71 in 1916 , with over 135,000 people taking part , which galvanized similar pro-war parades across the country			2
when @entity98 finally entered the war in 1917 , @entity30 was refused permission to enlist , perhaps because of his @entity287 background			1
exhausted and demoralized , his health collapsed and he entered a sanitarium , but he was allowed to serve just as the war ended			0
by then his tennis career was over and he spent the rest of his life in business , being on the board of the @entity296 and other firms			2
he died in 1949 , aged 64			0
his wife @entity298 later remarried and died in @entity299 , @entity300 in 1965			0
as a small child , @entity122 recalled asking her grandmother about the events of the fateful night			0
" she just said , ' i ca n't answer you , but i can say the worst part of the experience was on the @entity27			2
' " it was never mentioned again , but @entity122 became determined to recount the events and spent many years researching before putting pen to paper			2
she recently joined members of the @entity1 family at a special event organized by the @entity94			2
its headquarters in @entity317 , @entity318 has a special exhibition to honor both remarkable men and their remarkable story .			0
