-- the head of the @entity3 @entity2 , cardinal @entity4 , admitted wednesday that the church 's response to abuse had been " hopelessly inadequate			1
" " the church must continue to deal with the enormity of the hurt caused by abuse of children by some clergy ... and the hopelessly inadequate response to that abuse in the past , " @entity4 said wednesday			1
church leaders must " own up to and take responsibility for any mismanagement or cover - up of child abuse , " he said			1
the cardinal also apologized for his role in the church 's investigation into an abusive priest in 1975			1
" i want to say to anyone who has been hurt by any failure on my part that i apologize to you with all my heart , " he said at @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity28			0
" i also apologize to all those who feel i have let them down			0
looking back i am ashamed that i have not always upheld the values that i profess and believe in , " @entity4 said , according to a copy of the remarks released by @entity28 's @entity39			2
has the @entity2 reached a tipping point ? the deeply @entity2 country has been badly shaken by a government - backed report that found the @entity44 and other @entity2 authorities in @entity28 covered up child abuse by priests from 1975 to 2004			1
child sexual abuse was widespread then , the report found			2
pope @entity49 said wednesday he has finished writing his official statement , or pastoral letter , on the child abuse scandal facing the @entity2 in @entity28			2
he will sign the letter friday and send it " soon after , " @entity49 told the faithful in an address on @entity56			0
" my hope is that it will help in the process of repentance , healing and renewal , " he said			0
@entity4 has been under fire over the investigation into the rev. @entity64 , one of the country 's most notorious child - abusing priests			1
cardinal haunted by handling of abuse case @entity4 's office said tuesday the cardinal -- then a priest and teacher with a doctorate in canon law -- had been asked to investigate two complaints against @entity64 in 1975 but had no decision - making power			1
he reported his findings to bishop @entity80 , his office said , and @entity80 recommended @entity64 get psychiatric help			0
but @entity83 , founder of @entity3 survivors of @entity85 , said @entity4 should not have remained silent about what he learned in the course of investigating @entity64 , who later was convicted of dozens of counts of child abuse in both @entity28 and the @entity90			1
" he 's basically using the @entity98 defense -- he was carrying out orders , " @entity83 said , in reference to the justification many nazis used in their war crimes trials after @entity96 there has been particular outrage over the revelation that two boys who filed complaints against @entity64 were asked to sign confidentiality statements as part of @entity4 's investigation			1
the oaths of secrecy were " to avoid potential collusion " between the two boys as church officials investigated the case , the @entity39 said this week			2
despite his criticism of @entity4 , @entity83 said it would not necessarily do any good for the cardinal to resign			1
" he 's lost all moral authority to lead , but by replacing him , it wo n't resolve the problem , " @entity83 said , arguing the @entity120 would " just replace guys with other guys			0
" the best solution , he said , would be for the @entity2 to let secular authorities deal with accusations of abuse , rather than trying to handle them itself			2
" they have to accept secular authority , and they can get on with the business of religion , " @entity83 said			0
" it would be in the church 's own interest			2
resignations in themselves are n't the answer			0
" four @entity3 bishops tendered their resignations in the wake of the government - backed report			0
