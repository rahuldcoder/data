@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's as tall as some of @entity0 's highest skyscrapers , but the only residents here are rats and cockroaches			1
welcome to the @entity10 , the largest rubbish dump in @entity12			1
over 150 meters of garbage has risen from the ground since the area became a designated dumping site in 1957			1
now , six days a week , an army of 1,500 trucks delivers a heaving 12,000 tons of municipal solid waste from the homes and offices of @entity22 's millions of inhabitants			1
" this used to be a dairy farm ; a valley filled with cows producing milk			0
and now it 's a geological feature made out of trash , " said @entity29 , author of " @entity30 : our @entity33 " -- a book that charts the history of garbage in @entity12			1
@entity29 says most of the waste arrives straight from the bins of local residents			0
" if you 're like most of us -- most @entity12 -- you 're making seven pounds of trash a day			1
across a lifetime that adds up to 102 tons of trash per person , " he said			1
in 2010 alone , @entity12 accumulated 250 million tons of garbage , and although recycling in the @entity12 has increased by 34 % since 1960 , @entity29 believes the country 's attitude to waste is still not sustainable			1
" it 's very convenient to roll your trash to the curb every week and have it disappear , but it 's a magic trick -- and really there 's not very much magic , " he said			2
" we need to have less packaging ; use less disposable items ; ( use ) things that last longer ; make purchasing decisions that are more studied and less wasteful			0
" the environmental impact of landfill sites varies depending on how well they 're managed and resourced			2
however , typical problems include the contamination of soil and groundwater from toxic residues ; the release of methane , a greenhouse gas produced during the decaying process that is more potent than carbon dioxide ; and disease - carrying pests			0
@entity79 , chief editor of industry publication @entity80 agrees with @entity29 that we should all be trying to reduce waste and increase the amount we recycle			0
however , he says it 's likely there will always be a need for landfill , and we should applaud those sites that are well managed			1
" what 's happening now compared to years ago is that the technology and practices around waste management have vastly improved			2
it might be hard to see it from the outside , but they ( @entity10 ) have a state of the art landfill site , " he said			1
indeed , the layers of waste at @entity10 are meticulously separated by plastic membranes , designed to contain the brew of noxious chemicals that would otherwise leak out into the groundwater			0
the " leachate " is then collected and filtered to make it safe			2
the slums of @entity107 : a model of urban sustainability ? in addition , the methane produced by the natural decomposition of materials inside the tower of trash is collected through a network of pipes and burned to generate electricity			0
the emitted methane from @entity10 alone produces about 50 megawatts of power -- enough energy for 70,000 homes , according to @entity22 authorities			0
at present , just over half of all @entity12 garbage is buried in landfills , a third is recycled and the rest is incinerated to produce electricity , a process known as waste - to - energy			1
a recent study by the @entity12 @entity133 concluded that incinerating a ton of trash emits at least 35 % less greenhouse gas and yields 10 times more electricity than burying it and capturing the methane			1
so why does @entity12 still seem so in love with landfill ? " quite simply , it 's the most cost - effective option across most of the @entity12 , " said @entity141 , head of the @entity143 's waste division			1
" incineration plants require a large critical mass of waste to be financially worthwhile			0
this is easy to accomplish in densely populated areas , but the costs associated with processing and transporting garbage rise very quickly as the population density lowers			2
" @entity141 believes that landfill reduction will prove difficult until producers of waste and the municipal authorities responsible for handling it are given the right incentives			2
he says that in @entity164 -- where an @entity161 directive on waste management has decreed landfill a disposal method of last resort -- large rubbish dumps are dwindling			1
" in places like @entity170 and @entity171 , landfill now constitutes less than 5 % of total waste management , " he said			2
but some landfill is unavoidable : " at present residual waste that can neither be burned nor recycled -- hazardous waste and incineration ash -- can only be confined in well - managed landfill			0
" in @entity79 's view , the public attitude surrounding the very idea of " waste " should be reformed			0
" the term does n't do the industry any favors			0
most of what we call waste can be reused , turned into fuel or new products altogether			0
we should instead think of it as a great resource			0

@entity0 is home to @entity12 's largest landfill site , towering as high as a skyscraper
@entity12 accumulated 250 million tons of garbage in 2010 , most ends up as landfill
but there is complex *science* behind a rubbish dump ensuring it is safe and sustainable
