-- politicians make gaffes almost daily			1
some are fodder for late - night comedians			0
some are deadly to their campaigns			2
@entity11 congressman @entity10 's recent gaffe was so toxic , he may not only have killed his campaign , he may be the political equivalent of a zombie who also infects the @entity17 / @entity16 ticket with his deadly virus			1
the @entity20 public is smarter than most political campaigns give us credit for			0
we may not be geniuses -- me included -- but we intuitively grasp when a politician has merely slipped up or when he or she has revealed something much more significant			0
the first type of political gaffes are just that : mistakes			2
for example , when then - presidential candidate @entity33 said he had campaigned in " 57 states			0
" or when rep. @entity36 suggested that the @entity37 had started in @entity38			0
these kinds of comments are generally overcome			2
the only time they 're potentially fatal is if they occur with such frequency that they begin to define the politician			0
note to @entity47 : you are really getting close to achieving that feat. then there are the gaffes that are not gaffes at all			0
these reveal the candidate 's views on an issue or a character flaw that we had not previously seen			0
rep. @entity10 's notorious remark sunday clearly falls into the second category			1
@entity10 assessing candidacy with conservatives in @entity64 his statement that a woman being raped could magically shut off her reproductive system and avoid becoming pregnant was so outrageous that even @entity17 quickly denounced him			1
( surprising , because @entity17 failed to condemn @entity69 's despicable comments regarding @entity70 , the law student whom @entity69 called a " slut " on his radio show after she appeared before @entity71 to discuss contraception			1
) @entity10 's statement also brought national attention to his radical position that a woman who becomes pregnant from rape should be required to carry the baby to term			1
is this one statement enough to destroy @entity10 's @entity84 campaign ? a quick review of the history of political missteps of this type tells us that @entity10 is probably " dead candidate walking			1
" for example , in 1990 , @entity92 @entity11 gubernatorial candidate @entity91 was leading his @entity95 opponent , @entity94 , by 11 points with less than three months to go before @entity97			0
@entity91 then uttered a campaign - changing wisecrack comparing bad weather and rape : " if it 's inevitable , just relax and enjoy it			2
'' thankfully , @entity91 lost by 2 points			0
candidates have even been undone by a single word , as in the case of @entity17 's father , @entity105 , who had been seeking the 1968 @entity11 nomination for president			1
@entity17 had supported the @entity108 but then came out against it when running for president , as it had become unpopular			2
( this is apparently a @entity17 family trait			2
) @entity17 , trying to explain his new anti-war position , commented that in 1965 , he had visited @entity114 and met with @entity20 generals who " brainwashed " him into supporting the war			2
@entity17 's candidacy could never overcome this remark			1
and there was @entity11 sen. @entity121 's public use of the racially derogatory term " macaca " to describe a staff member of his opponent 's campaign who was of @entity128 heritage			0
@entity121 had been leading in the polls at the time but went on to lose that 2006 election			0
conservative @entity132 rally around @entity10 in face of @entity11 criticism some candidates have even been undone by simply showing too much emotion , causing voters to question the candidate 's stability			1
in 1972 , sen. @entity140 was a leading candidate for the @entity95 presidential nomination			0
but his candidacy came apart when @entity140 reportedly had " tears streaming down his face " as he emotionally defended attacks on his wife and himself by the publisher of a @entity38 newspaper			0
consequently , many were concerned that @entity140 did n't posses the composure needed to serve as president			0
in the same vein , @entity154 's 2004 presidential ambitions were derided when he released a flu - ridden ( and blood - curdling ) scream during a speech shortly after losing @entity159 's @entity95 caucus			0
but there 's one big difference between @entity10 's gaffe and the other politically deadly ones above			1
those hurt only the candidates who committed them			0
@entity10 's comments may even hurt the @entity17 campaign and other @entity11			1
indeed , the @entity170 chairman , @entity169 , instructed @entity10 to not attend next week 's @entity171			1
however , the problem for @entity17 and others in the @entity11 is that while @entity10 may not be at the convention , his radical view that abortion should be banned in the @entity20 with no exceptions for rape will be			1
this position is part of the @entity11 's national platform , adopted a few days ago and supported by @entity17 's running mate , rep. @entity16			1
as the postscript for this campaign is written after @entity97 , we may find that @entity10 's comments mark the first time that a political gaffe not only doomed the candidate who made it , it also dragged down his party 's presidential ticket			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity195 .			2

politicians can overcome some gaffes , but others are deadly , says @entity195
some gaffes are just *factual* errors . others are much more revealing , he says
@entity10 's rape comments may spell the end of his senatorial chances , he says
@entity195 : will @entity10 's comments also bring down the @entity17 / @entity16 ticket ?
