@entity16 @entity15 ( @entity17 ) was third on the stage , the same as his overall position			1
the route from @entity22 to @entity23 was reduced by 30 kilometers , leaving the special stage at 223km , as organizers accepted the @entity28 authorities ' request to shorten it because of the archaeological discoveries made a month ago in the @entity22 region of @entity31			1

we took the wrong direction at a y crossing but it was not too bad because we did end up on the right trail			2
we were tailing @entity1 , who had started about 10 minutes after us , so it was still sort of okay			1
there was a hidden way - point indicated as ' danger ' -- but it should have been indicated as ' extremely dangerous '			0
" the car behind us , @entity56 's car , would have fallen in the same hole as we did if we had not been there already			1
i 'm okay , i just have something broken in my arm , but i 'm all right			0
" @entity1 said : " it was really a tough stage			1
in places we would go around in circles for 15 minutes to find the right trail			0
it was very dangerous and the sand was really soft			0
" we stopped one time to deflate our tyres , then a second time in a huge canyon with tons of boulders			0
my co-driver @entity73 had to get out of the car to find a way out			0
it was really a tough day			0
" @entity13 added : " i can tell you that this was a very demanding stage			2
i can not even imagine how the amateurs will make it to the finish today			0
it was not just difficult , navigation was almost impossible			0
" it was a long series of horror situations from start to finish			0
" these were the longest 200km in my life			0
the sun and the sand were so bright that i could not see anything			0
" he added : " it 's not good news to know that @entity5 had to withdraw			1
he has an important place in the team			0
" in the motorcycle class , title holder @entity99 ( @entity101 ) kept his hopes of winning his third crown alive after taking his third stage in a time of 3:57:37 to climb into second spot in the overall standings			2
however , @entity111 ' @entity110 team - mate @entity109 did not make things easy for the @entity38 as he crossed the line 1:23 behind , to remain out in front with a 1:29:48 advantage			2
