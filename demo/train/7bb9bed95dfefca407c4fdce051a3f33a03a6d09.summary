-- the apparent resumption of forced " virginity tests " by security forces in @entity4 has dashed activists ' hopes for democratic reforms and fueled fears of a return to police brutality and abuse reminiscent of the @entity12 - era			1
four women arrested in recent months for taking part in anti-military protests have said they were subjected to virginity tests by the police whilst in custody			1
first - hand accounts of their traumatic experience -- published by the social news website @entity21 last week -- prompted an outcry from local and international rights groups angered by what some groups have described as " atrocious crimes " committed by the state since the ouster of former @entity30 president @entity29 in july			0
the virginity checks allegedly performed on the female detainees signal the return of a practice aimed at humiliating and terrorizing women protesters			2
one of the women who says she was forced to undergo a virginity test in january while she was in detention at @entity40 told @entity21 : " i thought the tests were history			1
i thought we had left them behind in the days of @entity12			0
" pattern of abuse in december 2011 , activists had celebrated after the @entity49 ordered an end to the shameful procedure , declaring it illegal in @entity4			1
the verdict was seen as a victory for @entity55 , the young activist who had filed a legal complaint against the military after she and at least six other female protesters were subjected to virginity checks performed by a military doctor on march 9 , 2011			1
" we performed the tests to prove that the girls were not virgins so that they would not accuse the army of rape later on , " a high - ranking general told me in a telephone interview on may 30 , 2011			1
it was the first admission from a military general that the tests had been performed , reversing earlier denials by the army that they had happened			2
however , in march 2012 , a military court acquitted the military doctor charged with performing virginity tests , on grounds of " conflicting testimony			1
" his acquittal was seen by rights activists as a blow for any hopes of accountability for the abuses women had suffered at the hands of the military			2
analysts and rights advocates say the virginity checks are part of a pattern of abuse practiced by the @entity96 that was reportedly dismantled after the january 2011 revolution but that has now returned			1
since military - backed protests led to @entity29 's overthrow , thousands of @entity100 members and supporters have been arrested and an estimated 1,400 people have been killed in political violence			0
many of the deaths were caused by " excessive and unwarranted use of force by the police and military , " according to @entity112			0
in recent months , the security crackdown on the @entity100 -- designated by @entity4 as a terrorist organization in december -- has widened , targeting dissenters of all stripes including secular activists and journalists			1
reports of torture many @entity4 have turned a blind eye to the rights abuses committed by the security forces against @entity100 supporters and some even condone the killings as necessary to rid the country of the the people they call terrorists whose aim , they say , is to destroy @entity4 and plunge it into chaos			1
in recent weeks , there has been an increase in reports of torture of political detainees , many of them based on testimonies of the prisoners themselves			0
earlier this month , interior minister @entity139 issued a statement denying allegations of torture or sexual assault by police			0
@entity139 said several human rights organizations had visited prisons in @entity4 and met with inmates and he welcomed further requests from groups wanting to check the conditions for themselves			1
a police officer working for the @entity153 's media department ( who requested to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak to the media ) said that those who make such allegations were " enemies of the state " who wanted to damage relations between the people and the police			0
in a televised address to the nation broadcast on july 3 -- hours after @entity29 was toppled -- defense minister general @entity164 promised a democratic transition and an inclusive government			0
riding high on a wave of nationalist fervor , he is widely expected to announce his presidential candidacy in the coming days			0
while he is being touted as " the nation 's savior " to bring stability , his potential candidacy is certain to deepen the polarization and increase political turmoil in the country			0
atmosphere of fear and uncertainty @entity164 has said @entity29 's ouster has saved @entity4 from civil war but a surge in apparent revenge bomb attacks by jihadi groups targeting security installations and checkpoints across the country since then is evidence to the contrary			2
indeed , the fear barrier was broken during the january 2011 revolution and young revolutionary activists believe the trend is irreversible			0
they insist their revolution -- " hijacked by @entity195 and subsequently , by the military " -- will continue despite the setbacks			0
but with a draconian law in place , criminalizing protests without prior permission from the police , the activists ' mission has been made difficult			0
they have been left with no alternative but to turn to social media networks to garner public support for their campaign			0
security agencies meanwhile , have made no secret of the fact that these networks are now heavily monitored , increasing the risk of arrest of internet activists critical of the government			0
and with the traditional pro-military media continuing to communicate messages that incite hatred of @entity195 and spread fear among the public , an overwhelming majority of @entity4 have decided to back the military 's return to power			2
it is in this atmosphere of uncertainty and fear that the virginity tests have made a comeback			1
few @entity4 are willing to speak out against the degrading practice and other rights violations			2
many of them say they can not afford to forsake security and stability for democratic principles and human rights			1
one of the detainees who says she was recently subjected to a virginity test whilst in custody told @entity21 " the people have forgotten what the army did to us in 2011			2
@entity164 supported the virginity tests for those girls in @entity251 , " she said			1
to her and other opposition activists , the overwhelming popular support for the military is both bewildering and frustrating			0
