-- @entity2 fighters have seized control of a strategic @entity5 port city just outside the capital , @entity7 , where @entity9 relief supplies enter the famine - stricken country			1
@entity13 fighters from @entity14 in @entity5 display their flag			1
@entity14 fighters chanted " @entity21 " -- or " @entity22 is great " -- on wednesday as the armed men entered @entity18 , located about 90 km ( 55 miles ) south of @entity7 , a local resident said			2
earlier this year , the @entity23 designated @entity14 a terrorist group and has accused it of having ties to @entity26			1
on tuesday , @entity14 took control of two towns near @entity18 -- @entity29 and @entity30 -- giving it a strategic base in central @entity5 , where it also controls @entity33 , the country 's third - largest city			1
the fall of @entity18 marks the most important territorial gain by @entity14 since it took control of @entity33 earlier this year			1
@entity14 is consolidating its control in @entity5 less than a week after a cease - fire was declared between other @entity2 militias operating in @entity5 and the country 's transitional government			1
under the pact -- which took effect last thursday -- @entity47 forces who support the transitional government would begin to withdraw from key positions on november 21 and leave @entity5 completely within another 120 days , ending a two - year presence in its strife - torn , @entity53 neighbor			2
@entity14 has rejected the cease - fire and was not a signatory to the deal , which was signed in @entity58 in late october and brokered by the @entity9 and the @entity59			1
residents of @entity18 said hundreds of heavily armed @entity14 fighters stormed the city without a fight , as rival militias who controlled the town had left @entity18 hours earlier			1
" they are now in everywhere in the town including the police station and the prison , " said @entity67 , a local businessman in @entity18			0
" residents are coming out into the streets in large numbers to see them			0
" many of the @entity2 fighters rolled into @entity18 in " technicals " -- pick - up trucks mounted with anti-aircraft weapons that may have scared off the rival militias			2
so far , @entity14 's seizure of @entity18 has not affected the @entity82 's aid shipments to the port city , @entity82 spokesman @entity81 told @entity0			1
" the situation in @entity18 appears to be calm , " @entity81 said from his office in @entity87 , @entity88			0
the @entity82 currently has 25 @entity5 staffers in its @entity18 office , he said			2
its eight international staff members were relocated a few weeks ago following the murder of a fellow staff member , he said			0
" all we can say is @entity82 is a neutral organization -- we work with the authorities who are in place to deliver life - saving humanitarian aid , " @entity81 said			0
" @entity18 is a very strategic location for us , a natural beach port			0
. that we plan to continue using			0
" ninety percent of @entity82 's food for @entity5 arrives by sea , either through @entity7 or @entity18			2
the shipments are currently being escorted by @entity108 naval vessels to protect them from pirate attacks off @entity5 's coast			2
@entity81 said most of the aid is delivered through @entity7 because " @entity18 can only take smaller ships , which have to unload on barges that take them on shore			0
" but @entity18 is a key port city because it allows @entity82 to reach more of southern @entity5			1
the conflict in the country makes it one of the most dangerous places in the world -- particularly for international aid workers -- and is making the humanitarian situation worse			0
more than 3 million people are estimated to be in need of humanitarian assistance there -- a 77 percent increase since the start of 2008 -- according to a @entity9 funded analysis released in august			0
one in six children under the age of 5 years is now acutely malnourished , and the numbers are rising , the analysis found .			0
