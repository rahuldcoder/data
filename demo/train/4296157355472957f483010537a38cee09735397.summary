-- ensuring a bustling aviation hub runs like clockwork is a challenging endeavor at the best of times			0
doing so under a blizzard of thick snow , ice and freezing fog can only intensify the battle against the clock			2
faced with these winter extremities for almost half the year , @entity11 has recruited a secret weapon to help meet its scheduling commitments -- the tv 2000 snow - blower			1
weighing in at a mammoth 40 tons and with a price tag of just under $ 2 million , the giant snow - plow can clear a three kilometer runway in as little as 15 minutes			1
the tv 2000 can remove " about ten thousand tons of snow an hour , " said the airport 's head of services , @entity21			1
" it pushes the snow with a plow , it sweeps the runway and it blows the snow to the side , " he added			2
an array of smaller vehicles finish the job			0
there are only four such devices in the world , he added , and @entity11 has snapped up two of them			1

@entity43 stretches between october and april in @entity44 , with snow falling regularly during this period			1
according to @entity11 ceo , @entity48 , this has pushed @entity11 to become a leader in airport snow maintenance			1
" we have winter six months a year , and we need to be able to handle winter operations more or less like summer operations , " @entity48 says			2
" this requires good planning , it requires a lot of resources , good procedures and a lot of training			0
" ( if not ) we will more or less be out of business , " he added			0
see also : the rise of airport dating the tv 2000 is a key weapon in the fight to keep flights on time but , as @entity48 intimates , there are a host of other snow - clearing devices and tactics employed at @entity11			1
this includes a rigorous de-icing process for aircraft and runways as well as a fleet of giant plows that follow the tv 2000 to clear the snow blown off runways			1
an extra 90 people meanwhile are hired by the airport just to assist with snow clearance during winter months			2
" the idea is this ( tv 2000 ) basically does the grunt work , " @entity21 explained			1
" ( but we also always ) have 27 guys ready in case the snow starts falling			0
" as soon as " the first flakes fall down we will drive out ... and ( begin ) the snow cleaning , " he added			0
the effectiveness and military - like precision of this process becomes fully clear when compared to winter performance at other @entity101 airports			1
see also : @entity103 airlines shaking up alliances few sites are exposed to the elements with such regularity , yet almost all find it hard to compete with @entity11 's record on punctuality			1
around 40 percent of flights were cancelled at @entity112 and @entity114 airports on just one day in january this year			0
@entity115 meanwhile was forced to close operations , leading to the cancellation of some 500 flights in the process			0
by comparison @entity11 has only ever had to cease operations because of heavy snow twice since opening its doors in 1998			2
on both occasions operations were up and running again after a matter of hours -- although @entity11 is considerably smaller than those in @entity128 , @entity112 and @entity115			2
" i think it 's fair to say that after fourteen years we are in the position where we have a very solid and very good operation , " says @entity48			0
" we are well prepared , know how to handle the situation , and we also have a policy of standardizing the fleet of vehicles , so maintenance and renewal is much more easy			0
" ( but ) we know that one winter will always play different from the previous ones so we ( will always ) learn something new , " he added .			0
