-- ten years from now , you could be sitting at home , feeling a little burned out			0
but then an app installed in your watch ( or on your contact lenses ) , having monitored your vital signs , analyzed your mood and scanned through your social networks , will decide it 's time you took a vacation and will present you with a selection of itineraries tailored to your budget and tastes			1
this is the picture painted by @entity15 , a report compiled at the behest of travel - booking site @entity19 using a team of 56 editors , researchers and futurists			1
though it reads a bit like a @entity29 ' novel , the report 's predictions are based on technologies that either already exist , or are in development			2
" the technologies in the above scenario are either real , being tested , or undergoing prototype development , " says @entity32 , co-founder of @entity33 , who collaborated with @entity19 on the report			1
get ( virtually ) real according to @entity38 , @entity19 's ceo , in the future vacation photo albums will be replaced with immersive experience recordings			1
@entity42 , for instance , could allow users to record an @entity45 safari from their viewpoint , then share the virtual reality experience with friends back home			2
" wherever we have photos that are designed to inform you , we will ultimately also have 3 - d immersive experiences , " says @entity38			2
other companies are getting in on the act			0
this year , media company @entity57 developed a @entity59 tool that through virtual reality , puts users onto the street of various cities			0
@entity38 notes that as virtual reality becomes more commonplace , travel companies will give clients virtual tours of hotels , cities and experiences			1
" they 'll become conventional tools for destination marketing organizations and tourist boards , " he says			0
recordings will also have a tactile element			2
users plugged into a virtual reality film will not only be able to see it in @entity81 , they 'll be able to feel the environment around them , be it the fur of a zoo animal or a sandy beach			1
@entity87 has already created @entity88 , an interface that gives tactile feedback through minute vibrations from virtual @entity81 objects , while @entity94 company @entity93 is working on technology that can convert sounds into textures			1
getting to know you according to the report , by 2024 travel agents , tour guides and concierges could all be replaced by a virtual entity with a finely - tuned sense of your likes , which it will gather from your search history , online reviews , social media presence and various other digital interactions			1
this guide could live inside a piece of your clothing and come out as a hologram , and ( perhaps mimicking your favorite actor ) it will be able to have a conversation with you			2
" it will essentially be an @entity124 device , constantly connected to the web , which has learned to intimately understand our individual preferences , " says @entity120 , a contributing futurist and author of @entity122 : how to use technology to go beyond your competition			0
these digital travel buddies will not only be able to tailor suggestions to you personally , they 'll be able to monitor your expressions to see if you 're actually enjoying yourself and tweak their recommendations accordingly ( @entity138 firm @entity137 is already working on an algorithm that reads human facial expressions )			0
" as we get smarter in the tools we build , they 'll become much more focused on what your motivation is , and what the appropriate search results are , " says @entity38			0
wear it loud several experts envision @entity150 , the @entity151 and @entity152 as the beginning of what will become a mass market in wearable technology ( @entity157 predicts @entity158 will ship 6.6 million units of @entity150 annually )			1
furthermore , microchips are predicted to get even smaller -- the width of 15 to 20 atoms by 2017 , according to @entity163 , president of @entity164			0
this means it will be possible to implant technology in places previously deemed impossible ( in the report , futurist dr. @entity169 predicts that @entity150 will move to contact lenses in five years )			1
the implications of this technology are perhaps the most far - reaching of all			0
in ten years , your clothing ( and eyewear ) could simultaneously translate foreign languages , both spoken and written			0
furthermore , @entity150 and its various successors could likely change the future of photography			2
" at the moment , souvenir photographs are exclusively taken through planning , " notes @entity38			0
by 2024 , rather than setting out to take a picture , @entity150 users could record their entire vacation , then instruct their device to pull out the best images			1
" technology will probably get good at suggesting moments that you most likely want to save , " he adds .			0

@entity19 teamed with 56 editors , researchers and futurists to create @entity199 report
travel agents and tour guides could be replaced with a hologram projected from a watch
travelers will be able to capture entire @entity81 , tactile experiences , and share them with others
technology will get so small , @entity150 *capabilities* could be installed in contact lenses
