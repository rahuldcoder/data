" why is your penis on a dead girl 's phone ? " if you have no idea what i 'm talking about then chances are you do n't know who @entity9 is			2
and if you do n't know who she is , then it 's likely you have n't tuned in to @entity14 to visit @entity15			1
those nine words epitomized the drama behind @entity14 's legal show , " how to get away with murder , " which has shattered viewership numbers , delivered a @entity21 award to actress @entity22 for her portrayal of @entity9 and shined the crown that comfortably rests on the head of one of the most influential women in culture today -- @entity15			1
" there is an unrivaled commitment to her shows , " @entity30 , @entity14 's chief marketing officer , said about @entity15			1
" thursday night has become a destination , with a sense of urgency to watch these shows live so the conversation can flow along with the wine			2
there are screening parties that revolve around them			0
wine and popcorn have become the staple of the night			0
" in other words , @entity15 -- the name given to @entity15 ' collection of tv dramas : " murder , " " scandal " and the matriarch , " @entity54			1
" when @entity14 packaged the three shows together last fall , it earned its best thursday night ratings in five years			1
this week the network announced it had ordered a new @entity15 series , a crime thriller , for next year			1
but attempts to explain the full breadth of @entity15 ' influence through the prism of @entity65 would be like ditching gps to use half a map for directions			1
her shows not only feature strong fascinating characters , they are also played by strong fascinating people			1
usually , television producers of popular shows are reluctant to let their main actors take visible bold stances on controversial social issues for fear of alienating eyeballs			2
@entity15 appears to welcome it			1
@entity81 , who 's in " scandal , " has not shied away from topics such as the role of affirmative action			2
in @entity87 ' acceptance speech at the @entity21 awards she spoke about the importance of diversity , thanking @entity15 and others for thinking a " mysterious woman could be a 49 - year - old , dark - skinned , @entity96 - @entity95 woman who looks like me			1
" and " @entity54 " actor @entity98 not only spoke out against racism and police brutality during the @entity102 conflict , he traveled to the @entity104 suburb to participate in the marches			0
" i think that she 's drawn to and writes about independent - minded , head strong male and female characters and so art sometimes imitates life , " @entity98 said			1
" what 's astonishing is that our show ' @entity54 , ' started off miles ahead all other tv shows because of its diversity and representation of people from all walks of life			1
there was n't any chest pounding about it , it just was			0
we 're people , that 's it			2
but we 're strong people , like her			0
she 's not trying to make a political gesture , she is one			2
she 's like ' i 'm dope with or without your racism ; i 'm dope with or without your sexism			2
' it 's not a strategy			2
it 's not seeing any reason to compromise and then demonstrating there is no need to do so			0
" and so when @entity15 stands in front of a room to receive a diversity award and calls out the industry for its lack of diversity -- as she did at last year 's @entity146 awards -- you know it 's not narcissistic grandstanding			1
it 's advocating for ideas and principals bigger than herself			0
when she stands in front of a room to accept an award for breaking the glass ceiling , and takes the occasion to give credit to all of the women in @entity160 who came before her , you know the appreciation is coming from someone who recognizes none of us get to where we are on our own			0
" different voices make for different visions , " she said at the @entity146 awards			0
" different visions make for something original			0
original is what the public is starving for			0
" which is why it feels as if everything @entity15 places on a network 's platter gets gobbled up by the @entity15 community every thursday night			1
it 's not that she is the only producer helming shows with snappy dialogue , office politics and sex			1
it 's that there 's an authentic , big tent feel to the debauchery that is unfolding on screen			0
and an authentic , big tent feel away from it			0
when one of @entity15 ' @entity198 followers complained about the " gay scenes " in her shows , she responded : " there are no gay scenes			1
there are scenes with people in them			0
" i do n't know if @entity208 and @entity209 will stay together or if @entity210 and @entity211 will ever be together			0
i just know that if you have no idea who any of those people are , you are probably doing thursday wrong .			0

this week @entity14 announced it had ordered a new @entity15 series , a crime thriller , for next year
@entity220 : there 's an authenticity and *courage* to @entity15 ' shows and characters that we are drawn to
