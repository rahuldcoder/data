at first glance , a cotton t - shirt from independent label @entity1 might look like any other basic striped crewneck			2
but @entity1 founder @entity5 says there are a few things that set her brand apart			2
her rib knit shirts and dresses last longer than usual fast - fashion fare , she says , because the people who make them bring a legacy of craftsmanship and manufacturing expertise			1
plus , buying them supports 64 - year - old @entity18 , who has worked for @entity19 since she was 18 , always living within walking distance of the factory in the heart of @entity23			2
supporting @entity1 also means supporting factory owner @entity24 , whose great - great grandfather built a water wheel in 1873 to power the hat factory that became @entity28 in 1906			2
@entity18 's first job was to put elastic in underwear waistbands , back when mass - produced garments were the company 's bread and butter			2
when production of commodity goods went overseas , @entity35 found a niche in custom jobs for boutique clients like @entity1 , creating shirts from high - quality combed ringspun yarn			2
today , @entity18 is the sewing floor supervisor who " makes everything work , " @entity24 said			2
so here 's the question : does knowing @entity18 's story , the history of @entity51 , or a boutique 's commitment to selling them make you more likely to buy a @entity1 shirt -- starting at $ 50 ? made in @entity57 : the short list a handful of brands and retailers are banking on that , hoping consumers will pay a premium for the stories behind their labels , and that their efforts will mirror the farm - to - table movement			1
@entity5 says it 's a formula that 's good for her business			2
" you know who you 're supporting			2
it makes you feel good , " she said			2
" there 's nothing like having that personal relationship			0
i can talk to @entity24 on the phone in the same time zone or drive to the mill if i have to			0
" " people care about where their clothes come from " @entity1 is just one brand that will be featured on @entity84 , a shopping site launching this week dedicated to fashion transparency			1
@entity84 co-founder @entity87 says the price of goods they showcase is n't really a premium			1
it 's simply a fair price for quality products made by skilled employees like @entity18 and sold by business owners like @entity5			0
" the fast - fashion frenzy has come at the cost of the quality of clothing and fair working conditions for factory workers			1
we see it over and over again in factory disasters around the world , " @entity87 said			1
" people care about where their clothes come from , and they want to know the story behind the label			1
" shoppers concerned with the ethical treatment of garment workers and with what goes into their tops and tees are showing more interest in where their clothing comes from			0
a series of deadly incidents in the past year in overseas garment factories prompted widespread outrage and calls for companies to improve conditions and oversight			0
after a building collapse in april killed more than 400 factory works in @entity127 's garment district , more than a million people signed an international online petition urging companies to commit to an enforceable fire and building safety agreement			0
outraged shoppers also registered their anger on companies ' social media sites			0
major @entity57 retailers announced a plan to improve safety conditions in @entity127 garment factories in july , and companies worldwide have pledged to improve worker safety conditions through funding , inspections and training			1
but will that outrage translate to conscious consumerism ? even people focused on the issue say it 's hard to know			1
co-founders @entity87 and @entity154 say they are targeting people like themselves , style - conscious and socially aware shoppers who have outgrown their trendy wardrobe of cheaply made goods			1
they say they 're looking to build a timeless collection of quality pieces they can feel good about			0
the two are familiar with conscious consumerism			1
the high school friends from @entity161 reconnected while @entity154 was planning the @entity162 , a non-profit that promotes artisan goods from around the world			1
@entity87 , who had made a name for herself as a digital strategist at the @entity167 and co-founder of @entity169 , served as a consultant			0
their goal with @entity84 is n't just to sell stuff , but to start a movement , one they compare to what @entity176 did for local and organic food , @entity154 said			1
" we 've seen through the whole farm - to - table movement that people care about where their food comes from , " she said			0
" we 're trying to reach those people			0
" @entity184 , author of " @entity185 : the @entity190 , " agrees that the local food movement shows that consumers are willing to pay more for transparency -- and a good story			1
" consumers want to feel like they 're supporting something positive and authentic , not just rejecting something negative when they buy , " she said			1
" up until now , ethical clothing 's story was it was sweatshop free or organic , " @entity197 said , " but what was missing was an authentic and feel - good human story about the people who design and make clothes			1
" the story behind the clothes @entity84 is just one brand that 's trying to tell the stories of where clothes come from			1
apparel brand @entity208 has long touted its dedication to promoting " fair labor practices and safe working conditions , " through detailed information on its website			1
several e-tailers with a heavy emphasis on @entity57 - made products , such as @entity218 and @entity219 , play up the stories of makers with transparent sourcing and manufacturing and the fashion universe is full of sites dedicated to ethical and sustainable fashion			1
when the executives behind @entity57 brand @entity229 toured the @entity232 factories that make its silk shirts , cashmere sweaters and canvas bags , it documented the journey on the company 's @entity239 and @entity240 accounts			0
@entity243 founder @entity242 said " radical transparency " was the company 's philosophy from the start , and it established a pattern of transparent pricing , listing costs and markups for each of @entity229 's bags , shirts and belts			1
showing where clothes were made seemed like the natural next step , he said			0
@entity242 and his colleagues spend months finding the right manufacturers for each product anyway , so why not share that information with customers ? " transparent pricing and ethical manufacturing are part of our core values as a company because we believe they lead to the best products , " he said			1
in turn , he says , it 's better for his customers			0
some call it slow fashion , ethical fashion or conscious consumerism			1
@entity280 uses the term " honestly crafted " to describe the goods featured on his site , well spent , which started under the name commerce with a conscience in 2009			0
its goal is to promote products that are " attractive , affordable and made in the @entity57 or similar first - world / non-sweatshop conditions			1
" when @entity280 started his website " going green " was still the big trend , he said			1
today , people seem to care less about the eco-properties of the goods they buy and more about where they 're made			0
that 's why some big - name brands , including @entity303 , @entity304 and @entity305 , are starting to make some products in the @entity57 , he said			2
" i think the fact that sites like mine are able to thrive is proof that there 's a demand for ethically made goods , " he said			0
" more and more people want to know the story behind their clothes , and they 're turning to the internet to find it			2
" finding stories of uncertainty this month , @entity154 and @entity87 piled into a car with @entity1 founder @entity5 to visit @entity51			0
dressed in clothing and jewelry from @entity84 's partner brands , including @entity1 shirts , they greeted owner @entity24 outside the main office , where a 1950 black - and - white picture of the mill 's staff hangs			1
when it launches this week , @entity84 will include information on where products are made , the raw material sources and a story about each brand 's origin			1
@entity84 also assigns each brand badges of " criteria for sustainability , " such as locally sourced , made in the @entity57 , environmentally conscious or handmade			1
factory and workshop visits are part of @entity84 's vetting process , although it has n't completed visits for all of its 45 partner brands , especially those based in @entity350			1
in those cases , it relies on documentation vouching for the company 's commitment to creating quality products using sustainable methods			0
@entity24 walked them through the process of making garments , while @entity154 , a former law clerk at the @entity361 , took notes about cotton sourcing and how knitting machines work			0
@entity87 tweeted images from the tour and posted photos to @entity240 : awards hanging from @entity371 's office walls , a picture of his great - grandfather @entity373 , bundles of waffle knit fabric , calendars hanging from work stations			0
they shot video of @entity381 as he cut patterns for shirts and @entity18 as she sewed striped shirts			0
over a pizza lunch in the employee break area adjacent to the sewing floor , @entity24 recounted the business ' struggles over the past decade			0
the last good year was 1998 , @entity24 said			0
since then , he 's laid off most of his workforce and cut their benefits , although he tried to make up for it by increasing hourly wages by $ 1.50 so they could pay for their own insurance			0
today , the mill employs 20 full - and part - time workers , including his son			0
if @entity24 could do it again , he 'd do it all the same , he said , because business was good most of the time , and they 've had a lot of laughs at work , staff picnics and friday hot dog lunches			0
as they rode home , @entity87 said the visit was uplifting , but sad			0
they 'd found a " hidden story " at the factory , something genuine and kind			2
but it was also a story of struggle and uncertainty			2
" it 's just so tough , " she said			0
" the fact he is n't sure of his future , his son 's future ... " she trailed off			0
" it just gives us our drive and motivation to make @entity84 work			1
" " it embodies what we 're trying to do , " @entity154 added , " bring prosperity to heritage and share their stories			2

some fashion brands , retailers emphasize transparency to appeal to conscious consumers
founders of @entity84 , a new shopping website , hope to appeal directly to them
@entity84 showcases brands from around the world that it vetted for sustainability practices
