-- members of @entity4 's security forces were involved in the forced disappearances of more than 140 people during the country 's offensive against drug cartels , a human rights group says			1
a report published thursday by @entity11 paints a dim portrait of @entity4 military and police forces , which the group says sometimes acted in conjunction with organized crime			1
vanishing victims : the ' open wounds ' of @entity4 's drug war of the nearly 250 specific cases of forced disappearances that the human rights group reviewed from 2006 to 2012 , security forces are implicated in at least 149 , the report said			1
an accounting of the country 's war against drug gangs -- put into high gear by former president @entity32 and inherited by president @entity33 -- reveals " disastrous results , " the human rights organization concluded			0
" president @entity33 has inherited one of worst crises of disappearances in the history of @entity44 , " @entity35 , the organization 's @entity36 director , said in a statement			2
@entity4 @entity46 march spotlights search for missing the report focused on @entity32 's time in office , and argues that his single - mindedness in fighting the powerful drug cartels led to an increase in human rights violations by officials			1
and the specific cases of forced disappearances the group investigated are just the tip of the iceberg , it said			1
in the northern state of @entity62 alone , officials reported nearly 2,000 disappearances between 2006 and 2012			2
@entity32 was n't the first to use the military to aid police in the fight against the drug cartels , but he ramped up the offensive and made it a centerpiece of his administration when he assumed office in 2006			0
at the time , drug violence was spiraling out of control in some parts of the country , and there were fears the government was losing authority to the criminal groups as they branched out from smuggling into other organized crime			0
a number of the country 's most wanted drug traffickers were arrested or killed during @entity32 's administration , but the overall level of violence continued to rise , peaking in 2011			2

in 2012 , there were 20,568 homicides across the country , an 8.5 % decrease from 2011			0
but the number of critics of @entity32 's offensive continue to swell			0
during his tenure , more than 47,500 drug - related deaths were reported before the government stopped releasing updated figures in early 2012			0
@entity11 estimates the figure to be more than 60,000 deaths			0
the organization first investigated the issue of rampant human rights violations by the military -- including forced disappearances -- in a 2011 report			1
thursday 's report says the dozens of cases reviewed show that all of @entity4 's security forces -- the army , navy and police forces at the federal , state and local levels -- are connected to forced disappearances			1
read more : why is @entity4 drug war being ignored ? the report is especially a black eye for @entity4 's navy , which is responsible for bringing down some of the top drug lords and is considered the most incorruptible of the military branches			1
but a concentration of disappearances using the same tactics , around the same time period , and in the same area , indicate the navy may have had a plan to commit abductions , the report claims			2
there is evidence that more than 20 people in @entity62 were arbitrarily detained by navy personnel in a two - month span and never heard from again , the report says			0
" the common modus operandi in these cases suggests that these crimes may have been planned and coordinated , or at the very least could not have taken place without the knowledge of high - ranking navy officials , " the report states			0
blame also falls on @entity4 prosecutors , who do poor jobs of investigating disappearances , often times mishandling evidence or not following up simple leads , the report says			1
read more : @entity4 's invisible women military officials did not immediately comment on the report , but in the past have said that it keeps in constant contact with @entity4 's @entity162 , and that less than 2 % of complaints have resulted in action by the commission			1
@entity11 challenged the @entity33 administration to bring those responsible for the abuses to justice			2
the organization also highlighted the success of the state of @entity172 , where the government has partnered with victims ' groups to fully investigate such disappearances			1
" at first , both sides were distrustful , " the report states			0
" however , when prosecutors -- motivated by families to investigate and held accountable when they did not -- began to genuinely look into the crimes , they gradually began to win back the trust of the victims ' relatives			0
and families , in turn , began to collaborate more openly with prosecutors			0

a new @entity11 report criticizes @entity4 security forces
the security forces are responsible for a number of forced disappearances , the report says
even @entity4 's *respected* navy is *rebuked*
the study cites a bright spot in the state of @entity172
