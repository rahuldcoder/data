-- former @entity2 assistant football coach @entity1 has been sentenced to a long prison term for sexually abusing boys , and for many people , this means that justice has been done			1
but in the complex crime of child sexual abuse , " doing justice " is rarely as simple as convicting and locking up the offender			2
for most victims of sexual abuse , sending the offender to jail is not the most important thing			2
their top priority is to be believed , to receive an apology or to restore their sense of trust			0
@entity1 's victims may have been accorded belief , but the apology does not seem forthcoming , at least from @entity1			1
and the sense of trust often takes a long time to repair			2
for the communities and families damaged by disclosures of sexual abuse , wounds continue to fester long after the cell door closes			1
there are almost always many who feel guilt or are blamed for having allowed the abuse or for mismanaging the situation and causing avoidable pain			2
the justice and mental health systems often do n't do enough to help with all this collateral damage			1
but " doing justice " also means preventing future harm			0
many victims ultimately come forward to prevent other children ( sometimes their own siblings ) from becoming victims			0
law enforcement believes that putting abusers away for a long time keeps the community safe			2
but while convictions and incarcerations do prevent some future offenses , it is naive to think that we can prosecute our way to child safety in this crime			0
for example , a third of all child sex offenses occur at the hands of other youth ( @entity63 ) , and these crimes are not likely to be prevented by greater incarceration , in part because few of these juveniles have records that would have allowed authorities to intervene			1
the key to real prevention is awareness and education			1
there is no question that the @entity1 case has advanced these goals			1
certainly , campuses all over the country are reviewing their standards and educating their staff members to make sure it " wo n't happen here			0
" but the @entity1 case also reminds us of how much more we potentially have to do			1
nearly 50 years after mandatory reporting laws came into effect and 10 years after the priest abuse scandal , highly educated and well - meaning professionals still fail to do the right thing			2
here are some changes that should be on our prevention agenda : make abuse prevention , detection and management prominent in the curricula of graduate education in all human service fields			1
create off - the - shelf abuse prevention guidelines and educational materials that small and large youth - serving organizations can adopt and disseminate without a lot of expense			1
provide evidence - based prevention education for children and youth at all levels of the educational system			1
through schools , libraries and pediatricians , give parents the skills and vocabularies for talking about abuse with their kids			1
finally , we need to see justice in these cases as a process , not just an outcome			0
convictions may be obtained , but victims and families are left battered			0
studies suggest that most cases with child victims take far too long to resolve in the legal system			2
many victims and families complain that they are n't kept up to date on what is happening in the case and why			0
victims ' identities are often not protected			0
investigative interviews and procedures can be intimidating and exhausting			0
helpful mental health and support services are not readily available			0
at the same time , much is being done to make the process more victim - friendly			0
child advocacy centers are being established all across the country			0
law enforcement is being trained in child development skills and sensitive interviewing practices			0
judges are being admonished to speed cases along			0
but we still have a long way to go before we can close cases like that of @entity1 with confidence that " justice was done			1
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity155 .			1
