-- the @entity2 m8120n is proof positive that quad - core processing is ready for mass consumption			1
this $ 1,150 entertainment - minded desktop serves up @entity8 's @entity7 @entity6 , a quad - core chip that up to this point we 've seen only in much higher - end systems meant for gaming			1
while @entity2 's own @entity14 or @entity16 's @entity15 might be better fits for most people looking for a pc to pair with their plasma , the m8120n is a great buy if you need a high - end pc that can do pretty much everything outside of gaming			1
this fixed - configuration retail pc serves up a host of audio and video connections , plenty of hard drive space , more memory than we were expecting , and integrated @entity32 -- all inside a functional and good - looking case			1
the result is a surprisingly powerful media pc ; you wo n't find a better performer for less			0
only its lack of a next - gen optical drive prevents a higher recommendation			1
we 're also not thrilled with the amount of shovelware			0
aside from its black exterior , the m8120n is similar in design to the @entity48 m7780n we reviewed at the start of the year ( @entity2 moved to its current @entity48 chassis in the spring )			1
we turned on the system and looked over the components , expecting to find a few incremental upgrades from the previous models			0
instead , we were shocked to find not only a quad - core processor but also @entity57 of fast @entity59 memory -- @entity60 more than we anticipated			1
a quick scan of our quad - core reviews confirmed our suspicion : this is by far the cheapest quad - core pc we 've reviewed			1
@entity2 is able to keep the price down in large part by not going after gamers with this system ( the preloaded trial offers -- shovelware -- also help subsidize the cost of the pc )			1
instead of putting money toward a powerful but pricey graphics card , @entity2 uses a low - end @entity74 @entity73 card			1
it borrows resources from the main system memory when it needs more than its @entity77 of dedicated video ram , but it 's more than capable for everything but supplying suitable 3d framerates as our tests show			0
beneath the graphics card is a tv tuner card that features an @entity86 tuner , an over-the - air @entity88 hd tuner , and an fm tuner			2
it allows you to connect it to your cable box or grab over-the - air channels via an @entity87 antenna ( which you 'll need to supply yourself )			2
the m8120n uses @entity97 , which includes the @entity48 shell			2
you can use it as your subscription - free dvr front - end to watch , pause , and record tv			2
it also lets you access other media files -- photos , music , videos -- via the included @entity48 remote			0
a slick , slim wireless keyboard is also included , but it lacks a mouse control nub or ball , which means living - room use will require mousing on your thigh , the arm of the couch , or coffee table if it 's something you ca n't control with the remote			1
a pair of @entity120 hard drives provides ample storage out of the box , and you can add more via the @entity125 bay on the front panel that can accept @entity2 's external hard drives			1
the drives come in @entity129 , @entity130 , and @entity132 capacities and require no wires to connect -- just slide them into the slot			0
they also feature a usb port should you need to connect them to another pc			0
aside from that , there is n't much room for expansion			1
all four memory slots are occupied , as are both @entity146 slots			0
you can easily get rid of the modem card if you need a free @entity146 slot , however , and there is an available x1 @entity151 slot			0
beneath the 15 - in - 1 media card reader conveniently located across the top of the front panel are two 5.25 - inch drive bays			1
we were hoping @entity2 's hybrid @entity158 drive would occupy one of the two slots , but , alas , we discovered a @entity162 dvd burner that might have excited us two years ago			1
then again , it 's probably too much to ask for that hybrid drive at this price			2
the @entity167 m8120n is a fixed configuration retail model , but you can customize a similar model on @entity2 's site			1
the hybrid drive adds $ 760 to the cost of the system plus a necessary yet reasonable $ 130 graphics upgrade			2
alternatively , you can configure the online model with a $ 200 hd dvd - rom drive if you want to watch next - gen discs but not write to them			1
by comparison , the hybrid drive writes to @entity158 and only reads @entity158			2
the lack of a next - gen optical drive is disappointing on this type of pc because it offers so much media - consuming goodness			1
in addition to the tv tuner , the @entity167 m8120n serves up useful av ports on the front panel			2
along with the usual firewire , usb , headphone , and microphone connections , the system gives you composite and @entity199 ports along with two @entity201 audio ports			0
the front panel ports make it a snap to connect a camcorder or other video device should you have the pc tucked into your home theater setup where getting to the back - panel ports may prove difficult			0
back - panel ports of note include digital audio in and out			0
the integrated @entity32 also increases its living - room appeal because it lets you connect to the internet without running @entity214 all over your house			2
and for such a powerful pc , the system is remarkably quiet			0
the advantages of a quad - core processor are obvious when you compare the results of the @entity223 with two dual - core systems , the $ 1,470 @entity225 and the $ 1,499 @entity226 , on our @entity227 and @entity230 tests			1
the m8120n completed our @entity227 benchmark 7 percent faster than the @entity226 system and 19 percent faster than the @entity234			0
the difference in performance is far greater on our @entity230 test that taxes multiple @entity238 ; the m8120m enjoyed a huge 69 percent advantage over the @entity226 and a 75 percent lead over the @entity234			0
our multitasking test provides a good glimpse of overall application performance under a typical workload			0
the @entity223 's showing on this test is particularly impressive when you consider that it easily outpaces a @entity234 pc that costs a few hundred more			0
while @entity252 's original xps 710 cost nearly five times more than the m8210n when we reviewed it in november 2006 , it 's used here by comparison to show what the scores of an overclocked , high - end , quad - core gaming pc look like			1
also note that the @entity252 @entity251 was running @entity262 , which is n't nearly as demanding as @entity97			0
@entity2 backs the @entity223 with an industry - standard one - year part - and - labor hardware warranty ( software support ends after 90 days )			1
toll - free phone support and live chat are available 24 - 7			0
one piece of preloaded software we do appreciate is @entity2 's @entity270 , a suite of support tools that can help you schedule updates and backups and diagnose and repair problems			2
the included printed materials are thorough and clearly written , from the huge , full - color start - up poster to the lengthy getting started manual			0

the @entity2 m8120n retails for $ 1,150
it boasts a quad - core @entity8 processor and outstanding overall performance
no next - gen optical drive on this retail model , little room for future expansion
