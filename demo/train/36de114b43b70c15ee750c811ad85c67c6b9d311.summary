-- hated by the @entity2 champions , chastised by the @entity4 's prime minister and even lampooned by a pizza company -- is @entity6 the number one enemy to @entity9 football ? if the @entity10 had not already secured his place as the " @entity12 " of the @entity9 game then he now has that role all wrapped up			1
as @entity6 sank his teeth into the flesh of @entity17 , he put paid to the old adage of " once bitten , twice shy			2
" no sooner had the @entity20 striker been handed a 10 - game ban for his meal on @entity23 than the entire footballing world began a furious debate over the severity of the punishment			1
" the @entity31 should explain how they 've come to 10 games , " @entity28 , football writer at the @entity30 newspaper speaking before the @entity31 released the reasoning behind their decision , told @entity0			1
" if they 've taken his past transgressions into account then that 's understandable , but by not explaining they 're allowing for lots of speculation and conspiracy			2
" they could have given seven matches , which is the same as the @entity47 fa so it would be interesting to see their reasoning			0
" it 's unusual for past offenses to be taken into account and perhaps there is a thought that they have something against @entity6			1
" the problem they have now is that next time there is a reckless challenge which goes over the top of the ball and hurts a player , what are they going to do ? " are they saying biting is worse ? " @entity6 is no saint			1
that much has been clear ever since that infamous handball at the @entity70 which deprived @entity71 of a place in the semifinal and earned him a red card and his country a place in the last four			0
then there was the episode where he was labeled as the " @entity81 " after he was hit with a seven match ban for biting @entity83 midfielder @entity85 's shoulder during a match in november 2010			1
his reputation was tarnished further when he was given an eight - match suspension and a $ 63,000 fine after being found guilty by the @entity31 of racially abusing @entity89			1
after sunday 's game , @entity6 , 26 , was quick to apologize for his antics and would have hoped for a lesser sentence			1
but he appears to have found himself in the unenviable role of @entity9 football 's hate figure			2
one company in the @entity4 has even brought out a @entity6 pizza where customers are invited to bite into his face , which is shaped with various toppings			1
the @entity10 has won few friends outside of @entity102 , despite riding high in the @entity2 goalscoring charts with 23 so far this season			0
his constant niggling away at defenders , his penchant for diving around the penalty area and his often childish behavior has riled opponents and opposing fans			0
but this latest incident , which occurred during last sunday 's 2 - 2 draw with @entity116 at @entity102 has caused outrage both within and outside the realms of sport			2
such was the outcry at @entity6 's actions that even @entity4 prime minister @entity122 felt compelled to offer his opinion on the matter			1
" it is rightly a matter for the football authorities to consider , " a @entity126 spokesman said			0
" as part of their consideration , i think it would be very understandable if they took into account the fact that high - profile players are often role models			0
" in a statement issued by the @entity31 on wednesday , the organization which runs the @entity9 game insisted that " a suspension of three matches was clearly insufficient and the player will serve a further seven first - team matches in addition to the standard three			1
" @entity20 , which has until midday on friday to respond , has already criticized the decision and the severity of the ban			0
@entity20 managing director @entity150 told the club 's official site : " both the club and player are shocked and disappointed at the severity of today 's @entity157 decision			2
" we await the written reasons tomorrow before making any further comment			0
" what rankles with many critics of the ban is that it appears out of proportion when compared to punishments handed out for similar offenses			2
writing on the @entity169 , @entity168 said : " it should have been five games			0
no doubt he deserves to be punished , but the @entity31 is too happy to demonstrate it has double standards for players like @entity6			1
" but others disagreed with @entity175 adding : i think they gave him the right punishment , especially he has blemish record against other players like @entity89 and @entity180			0
" during a @entity2 game in 2006 , @entity182 's @entity181 was shown just a yellow card for biting @entity185 , then playing for @entity186			2
at the time , an @entity31 spokesman said : " we are unable to take any action because the referee has already dealt with the incident			2
" @entity193 regulations prevent us from taking retrospective action			0
" @entity6 's ban is also longer than that of former @entity198 defender @entity197 , who was suspended for eight games after his elbow on @entity201 left the player unconscious			1
the @entity31 also issued a further 15 - match ban suspended for two years , while the club fined him six weeks wages and prohibited him from playing for six weeks @entity6 's ban is by no means the most severe handed out by the @entity31			1
in 1998 , current @entity208 manager @entity207 was banned for 11 games after pushing a referee while playing for @entity211			0
five years later , @entity213 and @entity214 defender @entity212 was suspended for eight months after missing a drugs test			0
another @entity213 star , @entity216 , was banned for nine months after launching a kung - fu style kick at a supporter during a game at @entity220 in 1995			0
@entity207 , @entity212 and @entity216 all went on to enjoy successful @entity2 careers , despite their off - field problems			0
@entity6 could yet follow suit with his name on the shortlist for the @entity227 -- voted on by his peers -- which will be handed out on sunday			1
and if he does pick up the prestigious trophy , you can be assured that there will be the gnashing of teeth around the football world .			0
