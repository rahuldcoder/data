january 26 , 2015 i 've been here 10 days now , and spent last weekend on call at @entity3 , the 55 - bed facility that @entity4 runs just outside @entity5 , @entity6 's capital city			1
the news here is good -- the @entity10 epidemic really seems to be coming to an end			1
but in the health care setting in particular , its effects will be felt for many months to come			1
many outward changes have been made at @entity3 due to the @entity10 crisis			1
all patients , staff and visitors now enter the hospital compound through a single gate where people must wash their hands with bleach and have their temperatures checked before entry			1
@entity27 is everywhere throughout the hospital			1
staff members with sprayers wash down the floors multiple times per day			1
they are on hand after surgeries or other exposures to blood or body fluids to decontaminate staff before they take off their gowns and gloves			2
temporary buildings have been erected to house our outpatient clinic , because our old clinic became part of the @entity46 , @entity3 - 2			2
but for the most part , @entity3 is up and running , and most beds are full			2
for me personally , the first week was about confronting the reality of death			2
many patients die in the hospital -- this should not be a surprise , right ? but emotionally it is a challenge to face mortality so frequently			1
we counseled several patients about their metastatic cancer this week , presenting them with the hard information that the cancer had progressed beyond a stage where anything could be done from the medical point of view			1
we talk with these patients privately , off the busy ward ; then , along with the hospital 's chaplain , we pray for them if they wish			1
the comfort and compassion we offer , along with an honest explanation in plain language , are important hallmarks of the work we do			2
friday , we had a 5 - month - old infant arrive from @entity77 , about a three - hour drive down the coast , in very critical condition with pneumonia , sepsis and a distended abdomen			2
very few hospitals have opened , so @entity85 was the closest one the family could get to			2
sadly , she died about 30 minutes after arriving			2
although we doubted this child had @entity10 , we wore protective gear as we tried to revive her and then performed an @entity10 test to be sure , which turned out to be negative			1
thinking about the possibility of @entity10 is going to be with us for a long time , maybe forever			1
later , we received a woman in her 40s who had been sick for about six months			1
she had lost weight and was so weak she was unable to walk			0
examination revealed a mass that seemed most consistent with ovarian cancer			0
she died during the night			0
we might not have been able to help her if she had come to a hospital sooner , because of the type of cancer she had , but if she had known her condition , her end of life journey might have been different			0
we mourn with these families and others who are losing their loved ones not to ebola virus , but certainly to the greater impact the epidemic has had on the health care system			1
the bright spot for the weekend was doing two cesarean sections on sunday with @entity115 , a @entity116 doctor in her first year out of residency			0
the first was a patient with a transverse lie ( the baby lying sideways in the womb ) ; the second a woman who had a big baby and not enough space to deliver			0
both of these babies came out alive and responded to some basic resuscitation , with crying and healthy color			0
that was a relief , and was unlike august , when delays in getting to the hospital caused most of our deliveries and c - sections to be stillbirths			0
finally , in the middle of the night i was called to go to the hospital to evaluate a woman who had delivered an hour and a half before			0
she had suddenly become dizzy and weak and then gone into shock			0
by the time i got there , despite iv fluids and oxygen , we had lost her			0
this was an unusual case -- one minute she was sitting up playing with her new baby and talking with the staff , and just a few minutes later she was gasping			0
she most likely had an amniotic fluid embolism , in which amniotic fluid entered her bloodstream and got into her lungs , a rare and catastrophic event which , even in the developed world , has an 85 % mortality rate as patients quickly go into shock			1
all through monday , my heart was heavy from the losses of the weekend			0
i think my co-workers felt the same way			1
but as we sang hymns and prayed during morning devotions on tuesday , we experienced a sense of unity and a release of our sadness			0
during the song " @entity173 , " the person leading devotions encouraged us to take the challenges we faced and the feelings that overwhelmed us and surrender them to @entity180 , who loves us and shares our grief as we do this work in his name			0
it was just a relief to lay it all down at the feet of @entity180 , restoring my spirit to be ready to care for the next patient who needs our compassion and concern .			0
