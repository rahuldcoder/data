-- scientists have discovered methane in @entity4 ' atmosphere , raising the possibility that life might exist on the planet			1
@entity4 may be more active than previously believed , scientists say			0
the methane could have come from past or present subsurface microorganisms , geological activity or comets striking the planet , scientists and @entity16 officials said			1
scientists were not sure how long the methane has been on the planet			0
methane -- four atoms of hydrogen bound to a carbon atom -- is the main component of natural gas on @entity26			1
it 's of interest to astrobiologists because organisms release much of @entity26 's methane as they digest nutrients			2
other purely geological processes , like oxidation of iron , also release methane			0
" it 's time , it 's prudent that we begin to explore @entity4 looking for the possibility of a life form that 's exhaling methane , " said @entity37 , professor of geological sciences at @entity39 , at a @entity16 news briefing thursday			1
the team found methane in the @entity4 atmosphere by carefully observing the planet through @entity16 's @entity51 and the @entity53 telescope , both at @entity54 , @entity55			1
using spectrometers on the telescopes to spread the light into its component colors , the team detected three spectral features , called absorption lines , that together are definitive fingerprints of methane			0
" microbes that produced methane from hydrogen and carbon dioxide were one of the earliest forms of life on @entity26 , " said @entity65 , director of the @entity66 , which partially supported the research			2
" if life ever existed on @entity4 , it 's reasonable to think that its metabolism might have involved making methane from @entity4 atmospheric carbon dioxide			2
" @entity16 's most recent @entity4 project -- the @entity82 mission -- came to an end in november after the solar - powered vehicle 's batteries ran down as the result of a dust storm and the onset of @entity4 winter			1
robotic instruments on the spacecraft collected and analyzed soil samples , looking for organic compounds that would indicate @entity4 is or was able to support life			0
@entity16 officials had landed the vehicle on an arctic plain after satellite observations indicated there were vast quantities of frozen water in that area , most likely in the form of permafrost			0
scientists were able to verify the presence of water - ice in the @entity4 subsurface , find small concentrations of salts that could be nutrients for life , and observe snow descending from the clouds			0
the lander also discovered a chemical in soil near @entity4 ' north pole that is toxic to humans but conceivably could be used as an energy source by certain microbes			0
the lander 's findings did not rule out the possibility that life once existed or even exists now , perhaps in a deep underground aquifer , @entity16 officials said			2
@entity16 's next mission to the planet is the @entity128 , a large , nuclear - powered rover with a suite of onboard scientific instruments			1
it is scheduled to launch in 2011 as part of @entity16 's long - term effort to study the early environmental history of @entity4 and assess whether the planet has ever been -- or still is -- able to sustain life .			1

new finding reveals the first detection of methane in the atmosphere of @entity4
methane could have come from past or present geological or biological activity
methane is the main component of natural gas on @entity26
@entity16 's next mission to the planet is the @entity128 in 2011
