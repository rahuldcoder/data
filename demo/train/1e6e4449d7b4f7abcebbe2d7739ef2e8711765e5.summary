-- @entity1 hates her boss , @entity2 , and wishes he would die			0
@entity3 is " carrying a bucket round in my car cause im so hungover			0
" @entity6 wants everyone to have his new personal phone number			0
and all of them shared these updates on @entity12			2
these ill - considered posts , and dozens more , are being collected on we know what you 're doing , a new website created by an 18 - year - old student and web developer to raise awareness about the information people unwittingly share on social networks			1
the site 's search tool combs public @entity12 statuses for words and phrases such as " hate my boss " and " hungover " to display posts under the headings , " who wants to get fired ? " and " who 's on drugs ? " " i was very shocked at exactly what people reveal in their public @entity12 posts , which is one of the reasons i started the site , " @entity35 told @entity0			1
" if there was no relevant data to prove the point , then the website probably would n't exist			0
" facebook users feeling helpless : what 's really going on @entity35 launched the site monday afternoon			0
by midday tuesday in the @entity50 , his page had received more than 120,000 unique visitors and nearly 5,000 likes on @entity12 , he said in an e-mail interview with @entity0			1
" i created the website to make people aware of the issues that it creates when they post such information on @entity12 without any privacy settings enabled , " said the teenager , who lives in @entity55 , @entity56			1
" the people featured on the site are most likely not aware that what they post as ' public ' can be seen by absolutely anybody , and that @entity12 will happily give away this information to other websites via its @entity69			1
" the site follows in a line of sites such as please @entity72 , launched in 2010 , which aggregated public check - ins from social - media sites such as @entity76 and @entity77 in hopes of showing people that there was a danger in alerting the public that they were n't at home			2
others have aggregated silly and ridiculous @entity12 status updates in the past , leading to a debate about the ethics of drawing attention to information that @entity12 users may not know is public			1
as of early tuesday afternoon , @entity35 said he had not yet heard from @entity12 or anyone featured on the site			2
he said he would be willing to remove any incriminating statuses from the site if contacted by the people who posted them			0
but that would n't remove the information from @entity12 , " so another website could easily access it , " he said			2
despite years of warnings about privacy , there have been numerous publicized incidents in recent years of people losing their jobs after they posted incriminating or offensive information on public @entity12 pages			1
@entity35 said he believes his site , which as of tuesday was showcasing more than 75 questionable , if not downright stupid , updates , helps demonstrate how often people overshare online			0
in case you 're pondering an alcohol - fueled @entity12 rant about your boss and do n't want to appear on we know what you 're doing , it may be wise to visit @entity12 's privacy - settings page and make sure @entity117 is not set to " public			1
" from there you can choose " custom " privacy settings to choose who can see what			0
you also can change who sees an individual post from your @entity124			0
@entity12 pulls location - tracking feature			2
