it is safe to go back into the water again -- at least in @entity2			2
a warning over the weekend for male swimmers off the coast of @entity6 and @entity7 to protect their private parts because of a testicle - munching fish appears to have been a joke that got out of hand			1
after a @entity6 fisherman caught a @entity16 pacu among his eels and perch this month , a professor at the @entity13 told men to be careful because the fish sometimes mistake male reproductive organs for tree nuts , one of their favorite foods			1
" anyone choosing to bathe in the @entity30 these days had best keep their swimsuits well tied , " professor @entity25 said in a saturday news release about the fish discovery in the strait separating @entity6 and @entity7			1
wednesday , however , @entity25 said he was just joking and never meant for his warning to get so much publicity			0
" we did say that we recommend men to keep their swimsuits tied up until we know if there are more pacus out there in our waters , " @entity25 told @entity35 by e-mail			1
" of course , this is half a joke since it is very unlikely that you would actually meet one here and that it would bite you			1
it 's up to people themselves how careful they want to be			0
i 'll keep my shorts on , though			0
" finding a pacu , a close relative of the piranha normally found in @entity16 , is unusual so far north			1
@entity25 said it was likely dumped in the strait by an amateur aquarium owner or fish farmer			2
@entity61 , a piranha researcher at the @entity62 who is also curator of fishes at the school 's @entity64 , poured water on the pacu warning			0
for one thing , he said , pacus are vegetarian -- and there 's no record of them attacking a human			1
" they 're fruit eaters			0
those big crushing teeth they have is for crushing seeds , " he said			0
pacus tend to swim under fruiting trees during high water , waiting for the trees to drop their fruit , seeds and nuts , @entity61 said			2
the fish then swim to the surface to eat the tasty morsels			1
in fact , @entity61 said , that 's how fishermen catch them : by putting a piece of fruit on the end of a line and letting it float in the water			0
pacus swim up to grab it and then get caught			2
" the nuts that they 're eating , the fruits that they 're eating , are splashing down from above , and humans do n't act like that when they 're swimming , " @entity61 said			1
and unlike piranhas , which have rigid , razor - sharp interlocking teeth , pacus have teeth that resemble human molars and fit together in a similar bite , @entity61 said			0
the pacus use those teeth to crush their food , not to rip it apart -- or off			0
he speculated that the pacu found in @entity6 was probably released shortly before it was found because pacu species ca n't survive in either saltwater or chilly temperatures			1
" it 's just too cold for pacus to be living there			0
they certainly would n't make it through the winter , " or even past october , he said			2
@entity35 was among numerous news outlets around the world that reported the @entity6 news release over the weekend , focusing on the special warning for male swimmers			1
@entity25 said he only meant to publicize the surprise discovery of a pacu in the @entity130 and to advise the public that the fish can be invasive and possibly dangerous			2
" the story about the ' nuts ' was never meant to be the headline			0
but it certainly got people 's attention , " @entity25 told @entity35			0
" i 'm sorry if it has caused you any trouble			0
it was a bit of a joke , but i still will keep my swimsuits tied up , and i will never swim in an aquarium with these fishes			1

a @entity6 professor said a @entity16 fish was found in @entity6 waters
he said the fish may attack male private parts , but now he says it was a joke
a fish **expert** says the fish are vegetarian and do n't swim in saltwater
there is no record of them attacking humans , the **expert** says
