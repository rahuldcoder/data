-- the winter of 1609 to 1610 was treacherous for early @entity3 settlers			1
some 240 of the 300 colonists at @entity5 , in @entity6 , died during this period , called the " @entity8 , " when they were under siege and had no way to get food			1
desperate times led to desperate measures			2
new evidence suggests that includes eating the flesh of fellow colonists who had already died			2
archaeologists revealed wednesday their analysis of 17th century skeletal remains suggesting that settlers practiced cannibalism to survive			1
researchers unearthed an incomplete human skull and tibia ( shin bone ) in 2012 that contain several features suggesting that this particular person had been cannibalized			1
the remains come from a 14 - year - old girl of @entity33 origin , whom historians are calling " @entity36			1
" there are about half a dozen accounts that mention cannibalistic behaviors at that time , although the record is limited , said @entity41 , division head of physical anthropology at the @entity43			1
the newly analyzed remains support these accounts , providing the first forensic evidence of cannibalism in the @entity3 colonies			1
what we know from the bones @entity36 's remains were found in a 17th - century trash deposit at the former site of @entity55			1
@entity56 , chief archaeologist at the @entity57 said at a briefing wednesday that the fort was built in 1607 , but has been washed away			2
@entity56 and colleagues began digging in 1994 and have been excavating the site on @entity62 ever since			2
@entity41 and colleagues can tell quite a bit about what happened to @entity36 when at least one starving settler in the fort apparently tried to feed off of her			1
if it 's any consolation , it appears that she was already dead at the time			2
researchers say it looks like someone had tried , but failed to open the skull with four shallow chops to the forehead			1
the back of the skull contains markings that could have been made by a small hatchet or cleaver striking it			2
the cranium cracked open from the last hit			2
forensic experts say it appears the person striking the skull was right - handed			1
the skull 's mandible contains cuts all over it and inside , which experts say reflect an attempt to take tissue off of the face and throat with a tool such as a knife			2
the cheek area reflects a " sawing action " of a tool going back and forth , @entity41 said			2
there are also sharp passages of a knife			2
at some point in the process , the head was removed , @entity41 said			2
the damage done to these remains indicates that whoever inflicted it was not a skilled butcher , he said			1
" instead , what we see is hesitancy , trial , tentativeness and an absolute total lack of experience			0
" the shin bone that archaeologists recovered also appeared to have been chopped , but in a way that more resembles classic butchering techniques , @entity41 said			0
" the person doing this was clearly interested in , based on what would have been accepted cuisine in the 17th century , in cheek meat , muscles of the face -- that area -- and tongue , and also in terms of 17th century traditional cuts , would also include the brain , " he said			1
it is possible that more than one person was involved in this , given the disparity in butchering practices seen in the head compared to the shin bone			0
what we know about the colonists in the summer of 1609 , the settlers experienced two significant setbacks , said @entity146 , vice president of research and historical interpretation at @entity149			0
the first was that a large fleet bringing supplies and settlers to @entity6 was scattered			0
it had been carrying 500 settlers from @entity156 along with provisions			0
" the fleet represented a new beginning for @entity5 , which had struggled over the previous two years , " @entity146 said			0
a hurricane scattered the ships a week before they were supposed to arrive			0
the flagship with the leaders of this pack ended up in @entity164			0
@entity166 's play " @entity169 " takes its inspiration from this event			0
six ships reached @entity5 in august 1609 , with spoiled or depleted food , and many settlers in poor health			0
" on one of those ships was @entity36 , " @entity146 said			1
at the same time , the relationship between the @entity5 colonists and the native @entity178 had broken down			0
the existing settlers were already experiencing disease and a shortage of food , and the demands they made on the @entity184 strained their relations			0
that was the environment into which 300 additional settlers arrived at the @entity55			0
one of the leaders of the group , captain @entity190 -- the same one who was famously friends with @entity192 -- returned to @entity193 in october 1609 because he was injured , @entity41 said , leaving a leadership vacuum			0
in the fall , the @entity184 waged war against these colonists , and launched a siege against the fort			0
with no way to get food from the outside , the colonists resorted to eating horses , dogs , cats , rats , mice and snakes , @entity146 said , according to the accounts of @entity212 , who was the president of @entity5 during this time			1
there are even accounts of people eating their shoes and any other leather that could be found			1
anyone who left to try to scrounge for roots in the woods was killed by the @entity184			0
@entity212 wrote , according to the @entity221 , " thatt notheinge was spared to mainteyne @entity223 and to doe those things which seame incredible , as to digge upp deade corpes outt of graves and to eate them			0
and some have licked upp the @entity228 which hathe fallen from their weake fellowes			0
" in other words , cannibalism			1
it 's not clear how many deceased colonists were cannibalized			1
only 60 of 300 of the original colonists survived , described as " looking like skeletons , " @entity146 said			0
in may of 1610 , the settlers finally arrived who had been shipwrecked in @entity164 , effectively saving the colony			0
lord @entity239 brought even more colonists and enough provisions to last a year			1
there are still more pits at the fort to be excavated , and only 10 % of @entity36 's body has been recovered , @entity41 said			1
" i think there 's going to be other examples , " @entity41 said			0
" whether that will be found -- with archeology you never know what 's going to be under the next shovel			1
" a special exhibition will begin at the @entity221 about @entity5 and @entity36 's story on friday			1
more space and science news from @entity0 @entity258			0

remains of 14 - year - old girl " @entity36 " found from 17th century
researchers say she was cannibalized , based on forensic analysis
this supports the accounts that historians have that cannibalism was used for survival
