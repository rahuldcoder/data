@entity0 , @entity1 -- they were roaming the halls of @entity5 looking for a fight			1
their target , according to police : @entity10 students			1
by the end of the school day , as many as 30 students of @entity10 descent had been physically attacked and many were sent to the hospital for treatment , according to school and law enforcement officials			1
@entity20 , who was a senior at the time , remembers december 3 , 2009 , like it was yesterday			2
" they were sitting along the wall , " he recalled			0
" i saw the one student , his whole t - shirt [ was bloody ] because his nose is broken			0
" @entity20 was not injured in last year 's melee , but he said the violence was racial tension between black and @entity10 immigrant students reaching its breaking point			1
after being attacked as a freshman and witnessing other attacks on @entity10 students , @entity20 founded the @entity36 to help new @entity38 students -- many who recently immigrated to the country -- adjust to life at @entity5			1
he also kept track of the incidents of violence against @entity10 students			1
last year 's altercation was the final straw			0
@entity20 and 50 other students organized an eight - day boycott of the school			1
they wanted to draw attention to what they felt was an inadequate response by the school staff to the ongoing harassment and violence leading up to the december 3 incident			1
" @entity5 should be safe , " he said			2
" the school should be responsible for students ' safety			2
" @entity62 , a native of @entity63 , was one of the students who participated in the boycott			2
he said standing up for what he believed in helped him find his voice			0
" you know , i see not everyone speak up , so i need to stand up for myself ' cause i see myself in there , i see trouble in there , " said @entity62 , who was a sophomore at the time of the incident			0
" i can not be selfish and stay aside to watch other people fixing stuff for me			0
i mean , i need to stand up and [ fix ] stuff for myself			0
" during those eight days , @entity20 , @entity62 and the other students met in @entity0 's @entity81 neighborhood during school hours , doing their schoolwork , holding rallies , and talking about ways to deal with violence at the school			2
despite taking a stand , @entity62 transferred out of @entity5 a year later , fearing for his safety and concerned about his education			2
nevertheless , the boycott helped trigger nationwide attention to the violence against @entity10 students at @entity5			1
months later , a federal investigation was launched following a formal civil rights complaint filed by the @entity97			0
" it 's huge , " said @entity98 , staff attorney for the @entity97			0
" it 's basically the federal government coming in and saying that the school district has failed to protect the constitutional rights of its students , which they have an obligation to do , " @entity20 said			1
according to the complaint , " the @entity108 and the @entity5 acted with ' deliberate indifference ' to the harassment against @entity10 students and ' intentional disregard for the welfare of @entity10 students ' " at the school			1
the @entity116 , which announced its investigation in august , has instructed the school system to improve the treatment of @entity10 students			1
and today , the perception among students and their families is that things are slowly changing			2
the school 's principal resigned in may , security has been increased , and the school district has said there have been fewer reports of student assaults			1
the superintendent of schools did not return @entity2 's calls for a comment , but the school 's new principal , @entity135 , says security at @entity5 is his top priority			1
" there is no room for bullying at school , " @entity135 said in a recent phone interview			1
" as principal , my no. 1 priority is to make sure my building is safe			1
" @entity135 is the fifth principal in six years at @entity5			1
a @entity0 native , @entity135 wants his school off the state 's " persistently dangerous " list , as well as meeting the @entity153 requirements , something his school has not achieved , he said			1
@entity135 used education " to change his situation , " he said			2
" i care because i was built this way , " he said			0
" i just truly see education as the way			0
" next month , @entity5 students will launch a campaign for nonviolent schools with the help of the city 's youth - led @entity163			1
the campaign seeks to improve school climate and enhance the trust between students and staff			2
student union member @entity170 was in the eighth grade when last december 's violence erupted at @entity174			2
moved by the boycott , she wanted to make a difference in schools			0
" we just want to fight to make a change in our schools so that they 're nonviolent , " said @entity178 , now a high school freshman			0
" what we believe is that nonviolence is power that helps people rather than hurts			0
" while things have improved , it is a bittersweet accomplishment , says advocate @entity190 , a board member for @entity191			0
" for all the wonderful students that we 've worked with who stood up around the issue , we 've lost dozens more , " said @entity190 , who helped many @entity10 students document their experiences			1
" kids who just dropped out , kids who just gave up , kids who are lost			0
you know this is some small consolation , but ... we lost a generation of kids			0
" but for @entity20 , who now attends @entity201 , speaking out helped him find his inner strength			0
" we have the power to change ; we can do something , " he said			0
" it 's not only adults who can do something , we can do something			0

last december , as many as 30 @entity10 students were attacked at @entity5
@entity10 students boycotted the school to protest what they felt was a lack of response
the @entity116 has instructed the school to better protect @entity10 students
new principal @entity135 says security is his " no. 1 priority "
