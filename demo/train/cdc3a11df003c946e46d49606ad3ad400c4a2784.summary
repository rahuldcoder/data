-- after scathing criticism from the son of slain sen. @entity3 , police in @entity5 , @entity6 , have apologized for including the clothes the senator was wearing when killed in an exhibit of high - profile homicide cases			1
the clothing -- a shirt , tie and jacket , with what appears to be bloodstains on the shirt -- was removed from the exhibit , " behind - the - scenes : the @entity20 , " at the @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity23			1
in addition , @entity5 district attorney @entity25 and police chief @entity26 , in an open letter thursday , apologized to any other victims ' family members who might have been offended by the other items in the exhibit , running tuesday through thursday at the @entity32 's 2010 conference			1
" based on the feedback we have received , it is now clear that a few of the items on display have offended some crime victims ' families , " the letter said			1
" we have both been to hundreds of murder scenes in our law enforcement career and we have consoled many family members			2
it was never our intent to cause grief to victims of crime or their families			2
" in a statement issued last month , the @entity20 had billed the exhibit as " a glimpse into some of the most notable homicides and critical incidents that occurred in @entity5 over the past 100 years			1
" " it 's about the history of @entity5 , as told through the eyes of homicide investigators of the @entity60 , " @entity26 said tuesday on @entity0 's " @entity61			2
" " this is an opportunity for homicide investigators from all over the country to get together , to share ideas , to share best practices and to talk about some of the most famous cases in @entity5 history , as well as their current cases			2
" but in an opinion piece in wednesday 's @entity73 newspaper , @entity74 , son of the late senator , called the display of his father 's clothing " a cheap bid for attention			1
" " the chief of police and the district attorney took my father 's blood - soaked clothing and displayed it , as part of a macabre publicity stunt , " he wrote			1
" it is almost incomprehensible to imagine what circumstances would have led to a decision to transport these items across state lines to be gawked at by gamblers and tourists			2
it is demeaning to my family , but just as important , it is demeaning to the trust that citizens place in their law enforcement officers			0
" the exhibit also features evidence associated with the death of @entity108 , the 1963 " onion field " case in which @entity20 officer @entity110 was slain , the @entity113 and @entity101 cases , and the so - called " @entity115 " murder , according to the @entity20 statement announcing it			1
family members of some victims in those cases told " @entity61 " the @entity20 should have notified them about the exhibit			1
" from my perspective , it 's very disturbing , " said @entity121 , sister of actress @entity122 , slain along with six others in 1969 by the @entity101 killers			1
" @entity127 , i did n't get any notice that this was going to occur			0
but these are very personal artifacts to me			0
these are things that bring back horrible memories , not only for myself , but other @entity101 family victims			0
" the items include ropes used in the murders of @entity137 and others , and a fork used to stab one of the victims , said retired @entity20 sgt. @entity142 , the curator of the exhibit			1
" we certainly try to concern ourselves with the thoughts and concerns of victims , and certainly our hearts go out to them , " @entity142 told @entity144			0
" ... likewise , we have an obligation , both as a museum and then the bigger one as the police department , to train , educate and inform officers and the public about people that do this particular job of investigating people that have lost their lives			0
" @entity121 said she can see the educational value , and might consider seeing the exhibit , but " i think a little bit of notice for people to prepare themselves would have been very , very nice			1
" also featured are the bloody gloves from the @entity113 trial and a watch cap collected as evidence , @entity142 said			1
@entity113 was acquitted in 1995 of killing his ex-wife , @entity172 , and her friend @entity173			0
" had we been given a little bit of notice , it would have been easier to avert your eyes , " @entity175 's sister , @entity174 , told " @entity61			0
" " ... i think there is an educational value , and i understand that			2
" but , she said , " it just comes back to sensitivity			0
" " if we 've offended anybody , certainly we extend our apologies to them , " @entity142 said			0
" but the intent here is to inform and educate , with the idea that we 're going to serve a greater public good			0
" the exhibit opened to the public wednesday , and " thousands of guests have stood in lines for up to two hours to glimpse @entity5 ' history , " said the letter from @entity200 and @entity26			2
" a number of the exhibits show evidence that was collected during various well - known incidents , and they were carefully designed so visitors would gain a better appreciation for the tragedy of murder and the difficult jobs law enforcement detectives have in solving often very complicated cases , " the letter said			1
" murder is the absolute worst thing one human being can do to another and the displays were designed to provide a unique insight into the sacrifice of victims and their families as well as the emotional toll murder takes on homicide detectives and the district attorneys who prosecute the cases			0
" " homicide is by nature horrific , but the entertainment media often portrays it as sterile and benign , " the letter said			0
" when people see the reality of murder , it becomes an unthinkable act			0
" the exhibit " was designed to be educational and show the public how murder cases are very carefully investigated , " the letter said			1
@entity3 was a @entity237 senator running for president when he was shot to death in june 1968 at @entity5 ' @entity240 , shortly after declaring victory in @entity6 's @entity243 presidential primary			1
his killer , @entity244 , is serving a life sentence at a @entity6 prison			0
in his op - ed , @entity247 said that he had contacted @entity26 and that he was pleased the chief had agreed to remove the items			1
" when i called to express my surprise and disappointment , the chief maintained to me that hanging my dad 's bloody shirt from a mannequin in a casino was part of an effort to train detectives , " he wrote			1
" perhaps he believes that , but to me it seems like a cheap bid for attention			0
it is almost like a traffic cop inviting motorists to slow down and take a good look as they go past a tragedy			0
" the @entity269 guarantees crime victims and their families will be treated with dignity and respect , he wrote			0
and as a former assistant district attorney , @entity247 said , " i understand that proper storage of property and legal evidence is a critical part of the judicial process			2
" he said he requested the return of his father 's clothing nearly 10 years ago , and the district attorney 's office refused , but he was promised the items would be treated with care and kept out of the public view			2
@entity26 , he wrote , should remember that " such items are personal property , entrusted to the state 's care , not to be exploited			0
he relies on crime victims to prosecute virtually every criminal			0
he can not long succeed if he continues to put victims ' pain on display for publicity			1
