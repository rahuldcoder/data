from beneath his bed , an asylum seeker types messages on a phone smuggled into @entity4 detention center in @entity5 , as two friends keep watch			1
" no crime to seek asylum , we are in manus jail			2
" he 's been there for 18 months and now finds himself witness to a mass hunger strike by as many as 700 fellow asylum seekers or transferees , as they 're called			1
he said he has n't joined them because he fears that the respect he has in the compound means he could be singled out as a troublemaker , and that if he was taken to the medical center , he would n't be allowed back			0
he has asked not to be named			0
photos sent from the mobile phone he keeps hidden from guards show dozens of hunger strikers lying bare - chested on the concrete floor of the detention compound			2
" many people fall , " he wrote , sending an image of man lying outside on the gravel with the message : " no power in his body			0
" asylum seekers in the @entity41 offshore processing center have been declining food for nine days			1
they 're protesting against the @entity45 government 's plans to send around 50 confirmed refugees to another facility in @entity48 , the capital of @entity49			1
the first of the transfers are due to start on thursday			0
both the @entity5 and the @entity41 governments have said that the move is only temporary , and it 's part of a program that will see some refugees resettled elsewhere in @entity5			1
still , the asylum seekers -- and government critics -- have expressed concerns			1
" it 's simply moving them to a different type of accommodation , an accommodation that asylum seekers are fearful is not going to keep them safe from resentment in the local community , " said @entity61 senator @entity60 , an outspoken critic of the government 's policy			1
so fearful are they of moving , some asylum seekers have resorted to self - harm			1
the @entity5 government has confirmed some have sewn their lips together , or swallowed washing powder or metal filaments from disposable razors			1
authorities have not revealed how many people have been treated by medical staff at the site , and information coming from advocates and those inside the prison is difficult to confirm			0
" it 's extremely challenging to verify the information that we 're getting , " said @entity89 's @entity88 , who said even under normal circumstances communication for the asylum seekers is " very limited			1
" on monday afternoon , security forces ended a standoff with transferees in the @entity98 compound , one of four compounds at the center			0
the transferees had barricaded the gates so that no one could enter or leave			1
@entity5 's foreign affairs minister @entity105 said the standoff was resolved peacefully with no serious injury			1
in contrast , advocates said the compound came under " attack " by security forces and transferees were seen being dragged away in handcuffs			2
@entity41 immigration minister @entity114 on tuesday conceded a " degree of force " was involved , but said the @entity5 government deserved praise for its professionalism in handling the situation			1
earlier he accused some advocates of aggravating the situation by spreading " false and misleading claims , " including reports the asylum seekers were being denied food and water			1
" there are no false and misleading claims and the minister ca n't point to any , " said @entity127 , from the @entity128 in @entity129			0
" yet again , the immigration department tends to point to some unspoken , unnamed minority when it 's really the government 's policy that are really the driving force of the protests			0
" conditions in the detention center have been the subject of criticism and complaint since it re-opened in november 2012 as the primary site for the processing of offshore asylum claims for people who arrive in @entity41 waters by boat			1
the @entity41 government has said the center meets international obligations			2
since then , the mental health of the transferees has suffered , according to rights advocates , and relations with the local community have been damaged to the point that the men fear for their lives outside the center 's perimeter			2
" they 've had constant threats , just last week , that they will be killed , that ( locals ) will settle accounts with them outside the detention center , " @entity127 said			2
the worst of the threats started 12 months ago , when a 23 - year - old @entity172 asylum seeker , @entity171 , was killed after days of protests erupted into violence			2
dozens were injured during clashes between asylum seekers , guards and locals who entered the facility			1
an independent report commissioned by the government into the riot found @entity171 " suffered a severe brain injury caused by a brutal beating by several assailants and died a few hours later			0
" last summer , two @entity5 nationals were arrested , including the alleged leader of the attack who had been employed at the center			1
the alleged involvement of locals -- and the fact that several alleged assailants may still be at large -- has raised fears inside the detention center that they 'll be targeted if not protected			2
the government has said security is adequate and refugees can call on the police if needed			0
senator @entity60 visited the island before the riot , in 2013 , and said even then it was clear to her that the local feeling of animosity toward the asylum seekers was " pretty severe			1
" " the local community think they 're criminals in a prison			0
they think they are people who must have done something wrong -- and they 're being told that these people are going to be living in their community , " she said			0
but she said a lot of the ill feeling relates to the huge pay disparity between the local and the expat employees			0
" the locals get paid $ 4.50 and hour , versus the $ 45 per hour for expats			2
that has always an issue of contention that has led to a lot of resentment about the facility overall , " she said			0
from his contraband phone , the transferee sends more images of signs , the words written neatly in capital letters on sheets hung in the compound			0
if you think we do n't deserve @entity41			2
then hand over all of @entity241 to the @entity245			0
we do n't want your help ! " the @entity41 government has said the @entity4 transferees are free to return to @entity249 , @entity250 , @entity172 , or wherever they came from			1
if they ask , they 'll receive government assistance to go back			0
however , senator @entity60 said that option is not being taken up by desperate people who once fled in fear of their lives			0
" anyone who is still left here now is because they 've got no other choice			0
" asked why he does n't volunteer to leave , the transferee texts : " i will die if i go back			0

hunger strikes enter ninth day on @entity4 , @entity5
*1,200* asylum seekers who entered @entity41 waters have been taken there for processing
they fear plans to move some to another facility will leave them *vulnerable* to attack from locals
