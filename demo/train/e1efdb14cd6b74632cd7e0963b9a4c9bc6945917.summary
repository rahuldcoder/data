@entity0 -- the @entity3 @entity2 on wednesday denied @entity5 's appeal against extradition to @entity7 over sexual abuse allegations , but the judges left open a surprise avenue for the @entity12 founder to fight on			1
@entity5 will take it , his legal team said , arguing that the judges made their decision based on issues that were not argued in court			1
@entity5 has been fighting for a year and a half against being sent to @entity7 for questioning about accusations of sexual abuse			1
two women in @entity7 accused @entity5 in august 2010 of sexually assaulting them during a visit to the country in connection with a @entity12 release of internal @entity28 military documents			1
the @entity2 appeared wednesday to clear the way for him to be sent to @entity7 for questioning , then unexpectedly gave his legal team two weeks to file an appeal			1
@entity5 lawyer @entity32 said after the hearing that he would request a new hearing			2
" the majority of the judges decided that custom and practice of the @entity41 community in effect trumped the law , " she said			0
that " was not argued in court and that in itself would be a breach of the ( @entity47 ) article 6 guarantee to a fair hearing			0
" it is very unusual for the court to grant permission to appeal its rulings , which are supposed to be final in @entity3			0
@entity12 ' work is not at issue in the extradition hearing or the @entity7 allegations against @entity5			1
@entity5 has not been charged with a crime , but @entity7 prosecutors want to question him in connection with allegations of " unlawful coercion and sexual misconduct including rape , " according to a @entity2 document			1
@entity5 , who has been under house arrest in @entity3 since december 2010 , maintains he is innocent and claims that the allegations are politically motivated			0
he fears that if he is extradited to @entity7 , authorities there could hand him over to the @entity28 , where he then could be prosecuted for his leaking of classified documents			0
in a tweet tuesday , @entity12 connected wednesday 's judgment with the arrival of @entity28 secretary of state @entity75 in @entity7 , which is scheduled a few days later			1
" @entity76 and state dept team arrive @entity78 june 3 - 4 ; 4 days after @entity5 extradition decision			2
@entity85 to think no discussion , " the tweet read , misspelling both the first name of the cabinet official and of the @entity7 capital			0
@entity76 is due to make a stop in @entity88 , according to a statement on the @entity91 website , on a swing through six countries			0
discussions about internet freedom are included on the agenda			0
@entity5 's lawyers fought the extradition on appeal via a legal technicality involving the arrest warrant			1
they argued that the " @entity106 " issued for @entity5 is invalid because it was issued by a @entity7 prosecutor , whom they say is not an independent and impartial judicial authority			1
his lawyers earlier vowed to take their fight all the way to the @entity110 if the @entity2 denies the appeal			2
two women @entity5 had sexual relations with in @entity7 in august 2010 subsequently went to police , who took down their complaints , according the @entity3 's @entity2			1
the @entity12 founder left @entity7 " in ignorance of the fact that a domestic arrest warrant had been issued for him , " according to the @entity3 high court			1

it has also published hundreds of thousands of classified @entity28 documents relating to the conflicts in @entity136 and @entity137			0
but the organization has come under financial pressure , leading @entity5 to announce that @entity12 was temporarily stopping publication to " aggressively fund raise " in order to stay afloat			2
an announcement at the top of @entity12 ' home page reads : " we are forced to put all our efforts into raising funds to ensure our economic survival			0
