@entity0 -- @entity2 had a reputation as a safety - conscious helicopter pilot			1
but when he prepared for a medical flight in august of 2011 -- while simultaneously engaging in a private text conversation -- he set into motion events that led to the deaths of four people , including himself			1
his actions could re-write the rules on when pilots can send private messages or make personal phone calls			1
federal safety officials on tuesday blamed @entity2 's crash in @entity19 , @entity20 , on fatigue , training , and , distracted texting			1
to the amazement of safety officials , @entity2 evidently sent several text messages with one hand while flying the helicopter with the other			1
but those text messages in the air -- which ended 19 minutes before the crash -- turned out to be less consequential than text messages he sent and received while on the ground			2
investigators believe @entity2 engaged in an extensive text conversation with a colleague about dinner plans while he was conducting mandatory pre-flight checks of his helicopter			1
because of those distractions , @entity2 missed two opportunities to detect that his helicopter did not have sufficient fuel for his mission , investigators said			2
when @entity2 finally noticed his fuel was low , he was half - way through the first leg of his flight			2
he arrived at the hospital , picked up the patient , and looked for an alternate , closer destination to refuel			0
but his 13 - minute stop was again disrupted by a private text conversation , and he took off after miscalculating that he could reach his destination			1
the @entity57 helicopter ran out of fuel a mile short of the destination -- within sight of the @entity61			2
the copter crashed into a pasture in mere seconds , killing @entity2 , the patient he was transporting , and two medical personnel			1
the @entity66 said on tuesday the crash illustrates that the dangers of distractions are found on the ground , as well as in the air			0
the board voted to send a @entity73 to pilots warning them about the hazards of texting during the planning and pre-flight stages			1
and the @entity66 is recommending the @entity79 prohibit the non-flight - related use of portable electronic devices while in flight and during safety - critical planning operations on the ground			2
the standard would significantly expand the @entity79 's so - called " sterile cockpit rule , " which prohibits pilots from engaging in non-flight - related conversations during take - offs and landings			2
in the @entity2 crash , @entity2 and a colleague exchanged 85 text messages during a 12 - hour shift			0
a lot took place as @entity2 prepared the helicopter for the flight , the @entity66 said			1
" it is easy to imagine that some of these interruptions could have led to forgetting of steps , including checking the fuel level , performing the preflight , " said @entity98 , an @entity66 aviation expert			0
investigators determined the engine had run out of fuel , but that the fuel gauges were working properly			0
@entity2 apparently misled his company 's communications center that he had adequate fuel for the mission , radioing from the hospital that he had 45 minutes of fuel when he had only 30 minutes			0
asked by @entity66 chairman @entity116 if @entity2 could have been mistaken , investigators responded , " we do not believe so			0
" @entity2 , a former army helicopter pilot who served in @entity118 , had worked for the company just under a year , and probably wanted to avoid revealing that he had taken off with inadequate fuel , which is a violation of @entity79 regulations , investigators said			1
the @entity66 said other factors leading to the crash included the pilot 's inability to perform a crucial flight maneuver known as autorotation after he ran out of fuel			1
in the helicopter he was flying , the pilot must transition to autorotation in two seconds to avoid a crash			2
the investigation found that the autorotation training the pilot received was not representative of an actual engine failure at cruise speed , which likely contributed to his failure to successfully execute the maneuver			0
and the pilot likely was fatigued , having failed to take advantage of his adequate off - duty hours to get sleep , the @entity66 said			0
one @entity66 member voted against the proposed safety alert , saying it diminished other alerts			0
" this will be looked at by the ( aviation ) community as an overreach , " said member @entity146			0
" it does n't make sense			0
" to read a synopsis of the @entity66 report			0

medical helicopter crashed in @entity20 in 2011 , killing pilot and three others
pilot engaged in private text conversation while preparing for *doomed* flight
