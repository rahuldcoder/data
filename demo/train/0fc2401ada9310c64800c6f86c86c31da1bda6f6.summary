@entity0 -- a @entity0 woman releases a deep sigh of relief as she reflects on a court ruling that her spouse will not be torn from her by the looming threat of deportation			1
" now we can make plans , and we have all the time in the world , " @entity9 , 26 , tells @entity1			1
monday , she received a letter confirming the ruling by immigration judge @entity15 that will allow her wife , @entity17 - born @entity16 , 36 , to stay in the @entity18 , according to the couple 's attorney , @entity19			1
@entity19 said this is the first time the government had asked an immigration court to close removal proceedings against a spouse in a same - sex couple since the @entity27 announced november 17 that a " working group " would be reviewing all pending immigration cases			1
the group began the process of identifying and closing " low priority " deportation cases three days after @entity19 submitted the request to close @entity37 's immigration case , the attorney said			1
" we 're really gratified because we feel that government moved in the right direction in the time we needed , " @entity19 told @entity1			1
he made the request to halt deportation based on @entity37 's marriage to @entity44 , who is a @entity18 citizen , and on @entity37 's " strong moral character , family presence , and deep ties to members of the community			1
" @entity37 lives with @entity44 in @entity50 , where she restores antiques			2
until monday , life for @entity37 and @entity44 had been put on hold for two years			2
@entity37 had been living in the @entity18 for more than 10 years since overstaying her tourist visa , when she was pulled off a @entity58 bus in july of 2009 and taken into a detention center in @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity44 explained			2
@entity44 , a social worker in @entity50 , traveled two expensive hours by subway , bus , train , and sometimes cab -- there and back every day for three months -- to see @entity37			2
" looking back on those days , we have come so far , we have accomplished something really big , " @entity44 said			0
the couple was married in @entity69 in 2010 , before @entity0 law allowed same - sex marriages			1
" we have gone through a really rough road these past two years			0
we never knew what was going to happen , " @entity44 said			0
" we lived in fear we were going to be torn apart , " she told @entity1			0
while celebrating their success , @entity44 said " the battle is not over			0
" she told @entity1 that @entity37 's effort to be granted a green card , which was originally denied , now has been submitted for appeal			1
" of course , we will not have full equality until @entity86 is gone , " the couple said in written statement			0
the @entity86 bans federal recognition of same - sex marriages			1
the act also says that states can not be forced to recognize such marriages performed in other states			0
despite the battle ahead , the happily wed lesbian couple is excited to have their life back			0
" at least we have this			0
we know she is not going to be taken away , we can live our lives a little better , we can do things we have n't been able to do , " an emotional @entity44 told @entity1 between joyous gasps			0
