-- in the wise words of @entity3 , " @entity1			0
" we 're rapidly approaching the close of 2012 and the technical end of autumn			1
and of course , according to ( pseudo-scholars of ) the @entity9 calendar , we 're a mere week away from @entity10			1
all that finality got us thinking about how folks really manage to lose their netiquette heads when they scramble , legs flailing and akimbo , toward the denouement of events and life chapters			1
so here is the ultimate ( get it ? ) guide to a polite big finish			0
if you 're leaving your job ... generally , it 's wise to wait until your last day or so to let the @entity26 out of the bag ( which is to say , to tweet or blog or otherwise post about your new gig )			1
why ? because until the ink has dried on your contract , you do n't want to run your mouth and risk sharing an update your new company wanted to announce itself			1
plus , your current employer might not want to be hit with a torrent of resumes			0
remember to give your professional contacts your new e-mail address before your account is shut down			0
then social - media up a storm on your first day or after your first week gushing about how much you love your new gig			0
just do n't do it during business hours			2
if you 're leaving a city ... the most heartfelt farewells will happen in person , but you do need to let your more casual acquaintances know about the relocation			2
a mass e-mail is wise , as are a few @entity53 " moving day is coming ! moving day is coming ! " updates on your social networking site of choice			2
but brace yourself : you 'll likely continue to receive mass digital invites to events and debauchery in your former city from well - meaning but clueless contacts			2
calmly write back to the inviter , explain that you wo n't be attending because you 're flipping 2,000 miles away , and ask to be taken off the attendant chain of e-mails / texts / @entity69 messages			1
if your company goes kaput ... the unemployment rate may have ticked down , but bankruptcies and shut - downs are still rampant ( co-columnist @entity76 's magazine , " @entity77 's @entity75 , " was shuttered on friday , in fact )			2
stay classy to aid your job search and keep the bridges behind you unburned			0
wait until the employer has made official statements to the press ( do n't blow the lid off the thing sooner ) , and then use whatever outlets you have to spread the word that you 're back on the market			1
( hi there ! ) ( hey , we could n't very well call ourselves @entity93 experts if we were n't big on the art of @entity95 , right ? ) if you 're leaving your wife ... digital missives should not , we repeat , should not be involved in the actual dumping			1
it 's an obvious warning that more than a third of adults bewilderingly ignore			2
suck it up and place a phone call or discuss it in person			0
then let your close friends or parents or whomever know about the break - up ( we recommend using e-mail or the phone ) before you go switching up your relationship status on @entity69 ( or worse , creating an online dating profile )			0
you do n't want your loved ones to call you in alarm after a stalk - y friend alerts them to your new @entity117 status , do you ? if you 're hanging up your hat as @entity93 columnists ... you take a bow and move on			1
these last 2.5 + years ( and 130 + columns ) have been real , and we 're legit grateful to the readers and fans who responded with balanced criticism , intelligent questions and positive feedback			0
we 've enjoyed mouthing off and calling out netiquette breaches as we saw ' em , and hope you 've picked up a pointer or two			0
but we 're moving on with our writing lives -- @entity131 with a @entity133 novel , @entity76 with a screenplay -- and we thought it wise to tap out before the world comes to a smoldering end			1
and to all the haters : good luck with your lives as well as basic motor tasks			0

@entity93 columnists sign off with digital farewell tips
do n't start posting about new jobs until old one 's done
@entity151 e-mails are good when you 're moving out of town
when *wrapping* a netiquette column , take a bow and move on
