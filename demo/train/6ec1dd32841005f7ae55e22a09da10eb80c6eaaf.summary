-- sometimes you just want to read			0
@entity3 's best answer for that simple urge is the now venerable @entity6 e-reader			1
these monochromatic devices are not only holding on in the face of stiff lcd - based tablet competition , they 're innovating			2
the latest update comes from @entity12 , which added an led - based " @entity15 " to its @entity14 e-reader			1
the 6.5 x 5 - inch device is not remarkably different from the e-reader @entity12 introduced last year			2
its dimensions are , in fact , virtually unchanged			0
but despite the new lighting tech , this reader is actually 5 % lighter than the previous model			0
it 's also somewhat lighter than @entity27 's @entity26 ( 6.975 ounces versus 7.5 ounces )			2
both @entity28 - only readers cost $ 139			2
you can get the @entity31 for $ 99 , but then you have to accept special offers ( essentially ads ) in place of the screen savers			2
more importantly , the @entity37 price includes the power adapter , while @entity26 sells it separately for approximately $ 15			0
still , what truly sets the latest @entity14 apart from all other @entity6 - based e-readers is the patent - pending @entity15			1
it makes the lightweight reader ready for night reading without the need for an overhead , clip - on or external light			1
by contrast , @entity27 sells a cover with a built - in led light for the @entity50			2
@entity12 is not the first to offer an @entity6 reader with built - in led lighting			2
@entity53 did it first a few years ago , but eventually discontinued the larger and more expensive e-reader			0
the @entity37 uses a single array of @entity16 's nestled along the top edge of the device ( above the screen , but below the touch - sensitive , anti-glare layer )			1
they light the entire display			0
i put the ereader to the ultimate test : bedtime reading			2
my wife , who was beside me , read by the super-bright light of her @entity68			0
i held the much smaller ereader in my hand , and pressed the physical nook " n " button for two seconds to enable the light			0
@entity14 's @entity73 is adjustable , via a touch - screen menu selection			1
so i cranked it all the way up ( the default , which was set to about 1/3 power , was not bright enough for me )			0
the light across the screen is n't perfectly uniform , but it is highly readable and very comfortable on the eyes			0
even after my wife powered down and went to sleep , she did n't complain about my @entity15			1
i also found the touchscreen , which works either with a tap or a sweep of the finger ( forward to turn the page and back to turn back the page ) , worked perfectly and made me wish my @entity91 was also a touch - screen device			1
@entity12 promises that the @entity14 's battery life will last for 30 days with an hour of @entity73 - enabled reading a night			1
i 've had the ereader a few days and charged it once			0
my original plan was to leave the @entity73 running and test if it could run , as @entity12 told me , for 60 continuous hours			1
the device 's own auto - sleep settings scuttled that plan by putting the @entity37 to sleep after five minutes of inactivity			1
overall , @entity14 with @entity73 is a winner			1
it 's easy to setup ( entering a @entity28 password is easy thanks to the touch screen ) , feels great in the hand , slips into my back pocket and holds thousands of books			1
the interface is smartly designed			0
i like the store design and how easy it is to buy things ( pretty much a match for the @entity26 store ) and found the @entity6 screen crisp and responsive			0
my only tiny criticism is the power button on the back			0
you use it to fully turn off the device ( and turn it on ) and it wiggles a bit too much for my taste			0
the good news is that , considering the battery life , it 's unlikely you 'll use it very often			1
if i were buying a new @entity6 reader right now , i 'd go for the @entity131 with @entity73			1
it 's slightly more affordable than the @entity26 ( when you include the charger ) , feature - sensible and now has the killer enhancement : a built - in light			1
those who pre-ordered the e-reader could receive it as early as this week			0
@entity12 reps tell us that limited quantities of the @entity14 with @entity73 will be available in stores next month			1
what do you think ? would you buy this @entity6 e-reader or have you permanently moved on to tablets ? share your thoughts in the comments			0
