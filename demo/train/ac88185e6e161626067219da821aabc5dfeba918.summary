-- @entity1 was 12 years old when he learned his family did n't die in a car wreck			1
his father suffocated his mother and then shot @entity1 ' 8 - year - old brother , @entity7 , in the back of the head while he slept , his grandparents explained			1
the elderly couple had taken the boy to a counselor			1
as they told him the real story of what happened , they pulled out newspaper clippings from october 1985			1
@entity1 had begun to wonder about the scars on his own head , and he had pieced together other clues from the past			1
yet he 'd never known the full truth			1
his grandparents then told him the hardest news of all			2
before his father killed himself , he put the .38 - caliber handgun to @entity1 ' head and pulled the trigger			1
medics had declared everyone in the house dead , including @entity1			1
now 30 , @entity1 visits church youth groups and juvenile justice centers to tell his story			1
a @entity34 , he believes @entity35 had a plan for him and that 's why he survived			2
follow @entity0 's @entity38 headlines occasionally bring back terrible memories , like the recent case in @entity42 where a mother is accused of suffocating her two boys before putting them in their car seats and letting the car roll into a river			1
when he hears stories like that , especially when a child survives , he bows his head and prays			1
at 12 , @entity1 grappled with the impossible : how could my father do something so evil ? " it was almost like going through it again			1
i started feeling all these feelings again , of anger , of betrayal , of feeling like nobody wanted me			2
i was angry at the world , and mad at my grandparents for waiting so long to tell me			2
" i was mad at my dad			2
mad at my mom for taking him back so many times			2
he recalled being in the hospital , staring at the door			2
" i was waiting for my mother to walk through or for my brother to come in and say , ' hey , everything 's going to be ok			1
we 're going to get out of here soon			2
' " now , he tells struggling youth that they 're not alone in this world			1
" even when we feel we have no inner strength left , you can make it , " he says			1
after he was shot in the head , he crawled to his brother 's bed and saw that his beloved brother was dead , he says , citing the coroner 's report of the massacre			1
bloodied with a hole in his head , @entity1 then crawled toward the doorway as if he was trying to find his mother			1
it was there that a medic saw him move , ever so slightly , after he 'd already been pronounced dead			2
a video from the scene shows a first responder emerge from the front door			2
" we 've got one alive in here ! " " i did n't want to give up , " he says			2
" i firmly believe @entity105 had his hands on me , saying , ' somebody is going to come for you			2
' " he says he does n't know why he survived , while his mother and brother died			1
he 's struggled with that over the years : " what if my brother survived and i did n't ? " those are questions he 'll never be able to answer			1
" i just know that my life was saved , " he says			2
" doctors do n't know why i 'm alive			2
... i have a second chance in life , and i just want to make the most of it and maybe help others who are internally suffering			1
" yet , it took years -- and lots of counseling -- to reach this point			0
he turned into a recluse in middle school and high school			0
sometimes , he 'd lay in bed all night , unable to sleep , " just thinking			0
" he was the kid who just wanted to get through to the next day			0
" it 's crazy to think about -- those incidents were something that my dad did , " he says			0
" my own dad tried to kill me , so who am i supposed to trust ? " sometimes he struggled with guilt -- feeling it somehow was his fault			0
" i was always searching for things that i could have done			0
" once , somebody asked him : are you afraid you 're going to go crazy like your dad ? " it just hit me really hard , and i do n't want to be like that			0
" he carried a newspaper clipping about the killings in his wallet			0
at 14 , he showed it to his youth minister			1

handed the article , he too began crying			0
@entity1 credits his youth minister and his best friend , as well as his grandparents and his church , with helping him get through			1
in them , he could see that " not everybody is as selfish as my dad was			0
and that helped me cope			0
" when he would lock himself in his room , he 'd often listen to music			0
the lyrics of one song resonated : " do not let the world get you down and remember that a bright shiny day comes after the rain			0
it is going to get better			0
