-- at the annual @entity4 upfront presentation last week , @entity2 - producer @entity1 revealed details for @entity7 ' upcoming live - action " @entity9 " movie , including a new origin story for the half - shell heroes that is sure to raise the ire of diehard fans			1
" when you see this movie , kids are going to believe one day these turtles actually do exist when we are done with this movie , " said @entity1 as he took the stage to discuss his new vision for the reptilian reboot			0
" these turtles are from an alien race , and they are going to be tough , edgy , funny and completely loveable			2
" in the original mythology , four baby turtles fall into the sewer and come into contact with glowing radioactive ooze , which mutates them into four bad - a * * warriors trained in ninjutsu by astute rodent @entity32			1
but could the rewriting of the @entity36 ' origin story dissuade some fans from embracing the newest incarnation ? a comic book - to - movie adaptation 's worst nightmare is bad pre-publicity , and @entity42 may have generated that in about 30 words			2
on the flip side , it might seem outrageous to non-fans of the series that " @entity50 " purists are offended by the new mythos of @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55			0
truth , we might sound a wee bit ridiculous when we cry out , " i ca n't believe @entity1 says they 're aliens when they 're obviously derived from radioactive slime ! " but @entity1 is essentially erasing almost 30 years of love for transmogrified adolescent reptile ninjas by claiming each turtle is less of a fearsome , fighting toxic anomaly and more of a forest green @entity65 with nunchucks			0
what would shredder think ! ? how does this new origin story make you feel ? are you a purist for the original backstory , or will you embrace @entity1 's vision ? and who would you cast for this live - action tmnt reboot ? personally , i think @entity32 's a toss - up between @entity79 and @entity80			1
