-- @entity2 and @entity3 leaders paint starkly different pictures of @entity5 , blaming each other for a crisis that shows no signs of simmering down			1
a defiant @entity2 president @entity9 said tuesday that masked gunmen are fueling anarchy in @entity5			1
he decried what he called an illegitimate government that illegally seized power in a coup with @entity3 backing , arguing that his country has a right to use military force			1
@entity3 president @entity20 and his country 's top diplomat said @entity5 's new government is democratically responding to the people 's will			1
they warned of invading forces and a desperate @entity2 breaking international law			2
" president @entity9 seems to have a different set of lawyers making a different set of interpretations , " @entity20 said , " but i do n't think that 's fooling anybody			1
" @entity9 blamed @entity36 powers , particularly the @entity3 , for causing what he called " anarchy and armed coup " in @entity5			1
" i have a feeling people in @entity3 sit in some lab doing experiments , like on rats , " he said , " without knowing consequences			2
" the conflicting descriptions are enough to give you whiplash			0
@entity5 's shaky new government is caught in the middle , and it 's clear that world powers do n't see eye to eye over basic facts about what 's happening			2
here are some of the questions at play , with a look at how key players are weighing in : what 's happening in @entity62 and @entity63 ? @entity2 's take : @entity9 described a country in chaos			1
" military men are walking around @entity62 in masks still now			0
they wanted to humiliate someone or show their force , " he said			0
" i think this is very stupid			0
" @entity3 ' take : the streets in @entity62 are " calm and friendly , " @entity3 secretary of state @entity73 said , and @entity5 soldiers in @entity63 have " stood their ground but never fired a shot , never issued one provocation , have been surrounded by an invading group of troops			1
" what we 've seen : in @entity63 , the situation is calm but tense , @entity0 's @entity84 and @entity86 report			0
@entity2 forces have surrounded 10 @entity5 military bases			1
there 's been no fighting -- or loss of life -- but there are ample signs of preparation			0
there 's a " war of information " in the region " between those who watch @entity2 state tv and those who are getting their news from the @entity105 , none of them listening to the calls from @entity62 for unity in this country , " @entity0 's @entity96 reported			2
in @entity62 , there are still barricades and battle scars from recent fighting before @entity118 's ouster , @entity0 's @entity111 and @entity112 reported			0
protesters there are waving posters depicting caricatures of @entity9 and declaring their willingness to fight against @entity2 forces , if necessary			1
in @entity63 : ' i feel unsure about what will be tomorrow ' who 's in charge of @entity5 ? @entity2 's take : @entity118 remains @entity5 's elected leader , and @entity5 's new government is illegitimate			1
" the legitimate president is only @entity118 , " @entity9 said			2
" there are just three ways to dismiss the president from power : death , his personal request and the third one , impeachment			0
... this procedure was not followed			0
" @entity3 ' take : @entity118 abandoned his post last month , refused to sign a transition deal , fled the country and was then voted out of office by @entity5 's democratically elected parliament			1
" he broke his obligation to sign that agreement and he fled into the night with his possessions , destroying papers behind him , " @entity73 said in @entity62 on tuesday			2
" he abandoned his people and eventually his country			0
" @entity5 's take : @entity5 has a legitimate government and is set to have new presidential elections on may 25			2

but not everyone in the country agrees			0
some support having closer ties with @entity2			0
@entity118 , for his part , said in a news conference from @entity2 last week that the planned may 25 elections would be illegal , insisting that he was still in charge and wanted to lead his country to peace , harmony and prosperity			2
@entity3 strategy for @entity5 crisis : money talks how many @entity2 troops are inside @entity5 ? @entity2 's take : part of the @entity177 is based in @entity63 , but @entity9 has n't acknowledged sending any additional troops to @entity5			1

asked whether they were @entity2 , he said the uniforms the troops are wearing could be purchased at a store			0
@entity3 ' take : @entity73 sounded shocked by @entity9 's explanation tuesday			1

a treaty between the neighboring nations allows @entity2 to have up to 25,000 troops in @entity63 , @entity2 's @entity155 envoy said monday , adding that @entity118 asked @entity2 to send military forces			2
@entity9 said @entity2 has no plans to take over @entity63			1
" if i take the decision to use military force , it will be completely legitimate and correspond to the international law , " @entity9 said , " because we have the request of the legitimate president and also ( it ) corresponds to our duties and corresponds to our interest in protecting the people who are close to us historically and have connected culturally			1
" @entity3 ' take : no , and @entity9 is playing a dangerous game			2
@entity20 said tuesday that the @entity2 president does n't have the right to use force to influence the neighboring country			1
@entity2 " has chosen aggression and intimidation as a first resort , " @entity73 said tuesday , accusing the country 's government of " hiding its hand behind falsehoods , intimidation and provocations			1
" @entity5 's take : no. @entity2 troops amassing in @entity63 and near the border with @entity5 are an " act of aggression			2
" if judged by the numbers , @entity5 's military loses war with @entity2 why is the tense standoff unfolding now ? @entity2 's take : @entity243 approved @entity9 's use of military force to protect @entity2 citizens inside @entity5			1
" this corresponds to our national interest to protect these people , and this is a humanitarian mission			0
we are not trying to enslave people , or dictate anything to anyone , " @entity9 said			0
" of course , we ca n't stay aside if we see the people persecuted , bullied or killed			0
we very much hope it will not come to this			0
