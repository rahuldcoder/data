a distressed - looking woman sits on a bed in a dark hotel room			0
a caption reads , " do n't let a candy bar ruin your vacation			1
" prominently on display at a busy @entity10 intersection , the billboard is a warning about the dangers of marijuana - infused edibles			1
" with edibles , start low and go slow , " it reads			0
it 's part of a public education campaign launched wednesday by the marijuana advocacy group , @entity18 , urging adults to consume pot responsibly in states where marijuana is legal			1
the woman on the billboard , red - headed with her forehead in her palm , is an allusion to @entity28 , a columnist for the @entity29 who wrote in june that a " bite or two " of a chocolate - caramel candy bar left her " curled up in a hallucinatory state " for eight hours			1
" the problem is that people have just never really been educated about the actual effects of marijuana and marijuana products			2
they 've simply been told to never use it and they are stupid if they do			0
and that 's not a very useful education , " said @entity41 , spokesman the @entity18			2
serious concerns over marijuana edibles have surfaced since @entity46 became the first state in the nation to legalize the sale of marijuana for recreational use			1
there have been at least two reported deaths following the consumption of marijuana - infused edibles			1
a 19 - year - old foreign exchange student fell from a balcony and died after consuming a cannabis cookie in march			0
about a month later , a man allegedly shot and killed his wife while reportedly high on pot and other drugs			0

@entity28 described her own personal experience of eating too much of a marijuana - infused candy bar : " i was thirsty but could n't move to get water			1
or even turn off the lights			0
i was panting and paranoid , sure that when the room - service waiter knocked and i did n't answer , he 'd call the police and have me arrested for being unable to handle my candy			2
" the column gained national exposure , not all of it positive as many pot advocates and late - night hosts mocked the columnist			2
her experience was the inspiration behind the new " @entity88 " billboard campaign , organizers say			2
" like most @entity89 , ms. @entity28 has probably seen countless silly anti-marijuana ads on tv , but she has never seen one that highlights the need to ' start low and go slow ' when choosing to consume marijuana edibles , " @entity41 said			1
with edibles , it takes longer to feel the effects of @entity99 , marijuana 's psychoactive ingredient , which can lead people to eat too much , then being hit hard by serious side effects that include delirium and psychosis			1
" if you smoke ( marijuana ) it 's in your brain almost immediately			0
so , the effects start very rapidly			0
you can have an edible and not feel much right away			0
up to an hour or two hours , three hours later you can start feeling the effects			0
it 's slower onset , and it lasts longer , " said @entity114 , director of the division of substance dependence at the @entity117			0
@entity46 state regulators are looking into stricter requirements for marijuana edible manufacturers that include better labeling and limiting each package to a single dose , about 10 milligrams of @entity99			0
currently , marijuana dispensaries are selling recreational pot products that contain up to 100 milligrams of @entity99 in a single candy bar			1
@entity41 said he hopes people see the billboard and take the time to really educate themselves about marijuana edibles			1
the billboard directs people to the campaign 's website , @entity138 , which has information about marijuana laws , products and their effects , including negative effects like " increased heart rate and a sense of paranoia			1
" campaign organizers also plan to put out print and online ads , along with educational materials in marijuana dispensaries .			0
