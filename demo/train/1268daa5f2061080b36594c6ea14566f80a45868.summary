@entity0 is a force to be reckoned with			1
twenty - four years ago , she was born in @entity2 , @entity3 , with an open spinal column , a condition known as spina bifida			1
normally , babies with spina bifida are operated on immediately after birth to minimize permanent nerve damage			1
@entity0 had to wait 21 days			1
her legs never worked and being an unwanted , disabled child , she spent the first six years of her life in an orphanage that was so poor it could n't afford a wheelchair for her			1
that did n't slow her down -- she walked on her hands			2
in 1994 , a chance visit to the orphanage by a @entity22 government official brought @entity0 and @entity23 together			1
the girl immediately sensed this would be her mother			2
once she arrived in the @entity22 , @entity0 received much needed medical care and began to flourish			1
she went from being the youngest member of the @entity22 @entity29 to 15 - time @entity30 ( including 11 gold medals ) , a 10 - time @entity33 medalist in wheelchair racing , and a gold medal winner in @entity36 two years ago			1
late last year , @entity0 , whose nickname is " @entity38 , " decided to try paralympic cross-country skiing because she wanted to come back to the country she was born in , compete in @entity41 and show all of those left behind at the orphanage never to give up and that disabled people " can also lead a normal life			1
" q : why did you decide take up cross-country skiing ? a : i 'm really looking forward to going back to @entity3 and to compete for my country , the @entity22			1
it 's good to go back and show that athletes with disabilities can still live a normal life and that you just have to give those people opportunity			2
and especially being adopted , and happen to be adopted by an @entity22 family ... they 're the ones who gave me that love and support to inspire my dreams			2
so i think it 's about showing that and just having fun			2
i 'm really excited to compete			2
i 'll be doing the sprint , the @entity67 and the @entity68 plus the biathlon			2
it 's going to be extremely tough , cold , of course			0
but i 'm really excited for the transition			0
the coaches have been very supportive and really understanding and have a lot of patience for me , because i 've been spending a lot of time looking at the snow instead of actually skiing , but the transition has been so much fun			1
my goal is to make the finals and see where that goes , and then after that i 'm back to training for @entity87 ( the @entity88 ) ... so , lots of training all the time , but i love it			1
sports is definitely my passion			0
q : what 's the thing you want people to take away most from hearing your story ? a : that there are no limits to what you can achieve if you put your mind to it ! @entity105 , dedication , courage are all critical ingredients for success in athletics and success in life			0
q : what 's one thing you 'd want to share above all else ? a : do n't put limits on your dreams			0
if you want it bad enough , you must try , and if you miss the first time , you must try again			1
do n't let others tell you that your dreams are too big -- or you ambitions impractical			0
we all must learn to listen to that drive that is within us			0
if we all listen carefully to that drive within , there are no limits to what we can achieve in life			0
q : what was your biggest lesson ? a : when i was competing in the @entity88 in @entity135 ( 2008 ) , everyone expected that i would get the gold medal in the 100 - meter sprint -- the first of my races			1
i came in sixth -- and i was devastated			0
i was in tears and thought i had failed in the eyes of all those who supported me , including my family			0
my mom gave me her " signature pep talk " and sent me back to the track to continue competing ... and i came away with three silver medals and a bronze medal			0
what i learned was that your family , your friends , your supporters will always love you as long as you do your best and keep on trying			0
q : what made you proudest ? or what 's been your hardest thing ? a : what was both the hardest ... and the proudest thing that i have done was making the decision to file suit against in @entity162 , @entity163 , for the right to race alongside able - bodied runners on my high school track team			1
we achieved victory in @entity162 -- creating a new law that has been embraced nationwide -- forever changing the face of high school athletics			0
q : what 's something you 'd change if you could ? a : most people think that i would " take away my disability " if i could			0
but that is n't true			0
i have lived a wonderful life -- and i do not , in any way at any time , consider myself disabled			1
we are all born with many gifts ... and the list of gifts that i have been given is endless			2
if i could change anything , i would make this a world where all children have loving parents ( birth parents or adoptive parents ) and are able to grow up surrounded by the love and care that can only come from a family			0
q : what 's the thing you rarely have time to share when you 're telling your story but that you feel is important ? a : i rarely have a chance to talk about how grateful i am to my family and friends for their unending support -- and to my coaches , particularly @entity206 at the @entity207 , who thought it would be good idea to " try a marathon			2
" i am fueled by the support of those closest to me -- and i can never thank them enough for all they have done to make my life 's journey possible .			0
