-- better late than never			0
as those in green danced with joy and celebrated the apparent end of @entity8 's @entity7 curse , those in orange were already planning their flights home			1
@entity8 , which had failed to win a last - 16 match in its previous five attempts , finally appeared to have cracked it			1
@entity14 ' strike , which came in the 48th minute , looked like it had secured a quarterfinal place for only the third time in nation 's history -- and the first on foreign soil			1
and yet , with the prize within its grasp , @entity8 faltered at the last			1
with just two minutes of the contest remaining , step forward @entity24			1
a man for whom nothing had gone right all afternoon			0
his passing was wayward , his touch was off and the quality with which he has been blessed appeared to have temporarily escaped him			0
but when the @entity30 needed the @entity32 man the most , he delivered			1
with 88 minutes on the clock , the ball came out to @entity24 on the edge of the penalty area and he sent an unstoppable right - footed effort into the bottom corner			1
cue the hysteria from the @entity41 fans , who had already consigned themselves to an evening of drowning their sorrows and an early flight back to @entity44			1
in the energy - sapping conditions of @entity46 , where the temperature pitchside reached over 100 , @entity8 suddenly wilted			1
for the best part of 90 minutes it had negated the attacking threat of the @entity41 , seen off @entity50 and looked good value for a place in the last eight			1
after all , for a team which only qualified for the tournament following a playoff against @entity57 , a place in the quarterfinals would represent a huge success			0
@entity8 , led by the charismatic and affable @entity61 , have become one of the most difficult sides to beat			1
but when it needed its resilience most , it failed			0
instead , @entity65 , the man who had tormented @entity8 for large periods of the second half , was brought down inside the penalty area by @entity69			1
while the @entity73 players protested following @entity65 's spectacular fall , their anger fell on deaf ears			0
" he dived three times , he should have cautioned him the first time , " @entity61 , the @entity8 coach , told reporters of @entity65 after the game			2
" it seems to me the reason ( we lost ) was the referee , the man with the whistle			0
he left us outside the next stage of the @entity7			0
" if the referee starts marking fouls that do n't exist , you leave the @entity7 to circumstances out of your hands			0
we expect the referee committee to take a look at that and that this gentleman goes home , just like us			0
" @entity61 was still seething after the game as he addressed the press -- and television replays suggested he had a point			0
nevertheless , a penalty was awarded and @entity105 showed remarkable composure to fire low into the corner and break @entity73 hearts in the fourth minute of six added on			1
" the players showed they had faith and belief until the very end , " @entity109 told reporters following the 2 - 1 victory			1
" the humidity was not in our favor , so when you see that until the very last minute we were fresher and fitter than the @entity73 , that is a big compliment to my players			0
" not only did they have belief but physically they prepared so well to play this match			0
that of course gives us enormous confidence going forward			0
" few would have expected such late drama , with the @entity41 appearing to struggle to create many clear - cut opportunities before falling behind			1
@entity8 , which defeated @entity130 and @entity131 either side of a draw with @entity134 , started positively and felt it should have been given a penalty when @entity136 fouled @entity137			2
those appeals were dismissed by referee @entity139 , as were the shouts from the @entity41 when @entity65 was upended by a combination of @entity142 and @entity69			2
with both teams having slowed down play following the tournament 's first three - minute cooling break , introduced by @entity148 to combat dehydration in the hot weather , it was little surprise that the first half ended goalless			2
but the second 45 minutes proved a far more entertaining affair -- especially given @entity8 's rapid start			2
@entity14 received the ball 20 yards from goal and his fierce effort flew past @entity158 and into the far corner			2
that goal appeared to stun the @entity41 -- a side which had swept all before it in the group stage			2
after all , this was a @entity30 team which had dismantled reigning world champion @entity165 5 - 1 , beaten @entity166 comfortably and fought back to see off @entity167			1
but in the oppressive heat , the men in orange appeared to be toiling under the heavy sun. when the @entity41 did get forward , they found the irrepressible @entity172 in the form of his life			2
already a star following his performance against @entity134 , where he produced save after save , the @entity8 goalkeeper was at it again			2
first , he denied @entity178 from close range , pushing his header onto the post before standing tall to block @entity65 's effort			0
the @entity41 looked down and out			0
@entity184 , one of the few experienced players who was there that fateful night in @entity187 when his side was beaten in the final by @entity165			0
with just two minutes remaining , his rasping effort flew past @entity172 and breathed new life into his ailing teammates			0
@entity105 , who had replaced the ineffective @entity50 , then converted his injury - time penalty to spark wild celebrations			1
a date with @entity197 now awaits the @entity41 -- for @entity8 , it 's home time once again			1
@entity198 : schedule of matches			0

@entity30 defeats @entity8 2 - 1 in @entity46
@entity24 and @entity105 score late goals to secure win
@entity14 had given @entity8 48th minute lead
@entity41 will face @entity197 in quarterfinals
