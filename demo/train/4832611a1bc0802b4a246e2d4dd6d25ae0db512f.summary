-- two weeks into the @entity3 government shutdown and , days before a potential default , president @entity1 has made a last ditch attempt to restore credibility to the world 's largest economy			1
in nominating @entity12 to chair the mighty @entity9 , the president has tried to soothe markets already roiled by @entity15 's bickering			1
do investors care whether @entity12 is a woman ? " of course not , " i hear you cry			2
what they care about is whether she will print more , cheap money and keep rates low			0
watch more : the most powerful woman you 've never heard of but aside from her immediate leanings on quantitative easing , @entity12 's nomination is an important milestone for female representation in the world of monetary policy			1
why ? because for the first time a woman is being entrusted with the value of not just any currency but the world 's most important reserve and trading currency			0
her actions will touch the lives of millions at home and abroad , giving patriarchal societies pause for thought			0

men may dominate the financial sector but for the next four years they will have to hang on a woman 's every word			0
yet as influential as she may be , @entity12 cuts a lonely figure in the global organogram of central banks , especially in @entity62 , where both the @entity63 and the @entity64 are currently bereft of girl power at the top of the tree			1
a cursory glance at the @entity69 shows just 12 of the world 's 160 central banks had female governors last year			1
that 's about 6 %			0
such figures would not be acceptable on the board of your average listed firm			0
last year 15 % of directors at @entity80 companies were women while the @entity82 is pushing for boards to raise that quota to 40 % by the end of the decade			0
read more : women still missing from @entity89 boards @entity12 is no ordinary women or economist			2
she is an extraordinarily experienced , trusted pair of hands who faces a formidable task ahead in trying to wean world markets off five years of basically free money			0
but in elevating her to its helm , the @entity9 joins a woefully short list of national banks with female governors that includes not exactly influential countries like @entity103 , the @entity104 and @entity105			2
though her appointment still has to be approved @entity12 's promotion will make her arguably the second most powerful person in the @entity3			1
if women can take on a mantle as big as that , surely it 's time they had more of a say in the clubby world of monetary policy .			2

@entity12 has been nominated by president @entity1 to lead the @entity9
this would make her one of the most powerful women in the world
but it also *reveals* how few female central bankers there are around the world
