editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			0
@entity9 is @entity5 's broadband television network			0
the reports , which are produced solely by @entity5 , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity8 ( @entity19 ) -- in february 2010 , @entity21 @entity20 launched @entity22 : @entity23 , the biggest operation since the start of the @entity22 war			1
its main target was the @entity30 stronghold of @entity31 , a town in @entity32			0
journalist @entity33 , who spent two months with the @entity21 forces , offers an extraordinarily intimate look at the brutal realities of modern - day warfare in the harrowing documentary " @entity38 , " debuting thursday , february 17 at 9 p.m. et exclusively on @entity19 , marking the first anniversary of this historic battle			1
@entity23 was the first attack launched after the @entity42 administration announced plans to send 30,000 troops to @entity22 , serving as a key test of the @entity21 counterinsurgency strategy against the @entity30			1
the campaign had four distinct phases : clear @entity31 of @entity30 , hold all ground seized , build infrastructure and governance and transfer control to @entity22 security forces			1
in addition to chronicling the operation , " @entity38 " asks whether the policy is a successful prototype for winning this kind of war			1
@entity33 spent two months embedded with @entity60 , the first @entity20 dropped into the center of @entity31 , where they encountered a maze of improvised explosive devices , bunkers , trenches and ambushes set by well - trained @entity30 fighters			1
the new rules of engagement , dubbed " courageous restraint " by gen. @entity70 , meant they could not fire until fired upon and had great difficulty getting airstrikes approved			0
while these rules were intended to limit civilian causalities , they put the @entity20 in highly treacherous situations			2
@entity60 's leader , capt. @entity78 , is a mentor and friend to many of the young @entity20 , often making split - second decisions when lives are in danger			1
he acknowledges the challenges when he addresses his men , saying , " i guarantee you we will lose @entity20			2
i guarantee you we will			0
do n't let emotions control you			0
there 's 80,000 civilians in this city ; there 's maybe a thousand enemy			0
so when i go home , i do n't want to feel ashamed because i 'm having problems sleeping at night , because i 'm not sure that i did the right thing			0
what happens over the next five days will be a cornerstone of your memory for the rest of your life			0
" see the rest of " @entity38 " at @entity9 @entity33 joined the @entity20 on the front lines of combat and in makeshift sleeping quarters , where he caught glimpses of their personal lives			1
one @entity20 confesses how much he misses his 5 - month - old son , having spent only two months with him before leaving for battle			1
" @entity38 " also looks at the relationship between the @entity20 and the @entity22 people			1
as @entity115 explains , the key to success is " to get the people on your side , and let them understand that you 're here for them , " not an easy task when the locals lose friends and loved ones by following the @entity20 ' orders			2
for example , the documentary shows one man receiving a condolence payment when members of his family are killed by a stray rocket after being told to stay inside for shelter			0
the @entity20 ' mission is complicated by their @entity22 partners -- the army , police and government			1
the government is nowhere to be seen , the police are feared by the locals , and the army soldiers -- a few of whom accompany the @entity20 into battle -- are a liability			2
in addition , the members of the @entity22 army assigned to the area are from the north and speak a different language and come from different ethnic groups than the residents of @entity31			2
although they achieve their initial mission , when @entity33 returns four months later , the @entity20 have lost 20 % of their fighting force to casualties , and battle daily to maintain their shrinking zone of control			1
meanwhile , the local economy is still in shambles and the future of the war is in question			0
still , as one @entity20 remarks , " @entity20 fight battles , they do n't fight wars			2

documentary marks first anniversary of largest operation since start of the @entity22 war
