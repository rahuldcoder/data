-- some had been in their homes for 50 years with never a lick of water damage			2
now those homes are , essentially , gone			2
that 's the case in parts of @entity8 , where powerful bursts of rain falling in already saturated areas swelled rivers , caused waters to cascade from hills and contributed to sudden floods that " just destroyed and demolished ( homes ) in a matter of minutes , just out of the blue , " gov. @entity16 said saturday			1
the good news , according to the governor ? " we think the worst is behind us -- for now			1
" the reasons are that , by saturday evening , rivers around the area had already crested , meaning the flooding threat from them should not get any worse immediately			2
and the weather , thankfully , is cooperating for the time being			0
while showers and thunderstorms are possible sunday in places like @entity34 , even that would be a far cry from what happened earlier this week			0
still , the last few days are a not - so - subtle reminder that things can change quick : the @entity39 forecasts a chance of heavy rain from sunday night through tuesday			0
one woman is unaccounted for in @entity46 , a village along the @entity47 and the @entity48 about 55 miles west of @entity49 , that village 's police chief @entity44 told @entity0			1
officers , then trying to get everyone in the area to safety , saw @entity54 before her home was washed away by rapidly rising waters , @entity44 said			0
helicopters and k9 units were used to look for her through friday night , after which authorities moved from search and recovery to a recovery mission , according to the police chief			1
states of emergency were in effect saturday for 15 counties -- affecting cities from @entity70 near the @entity72 border north to @entity73 , which is close to @entity74			1
several hundred people had been evacuated in @entity76 , @entity47 , @entity77 and @entity78 , and 56 shelters were operational saturday around the state			0
authorities did not give estimates saturday as to how many structures had been damaged , or how bad , in the flooding			1
@entity16 , who has toured some of the hard - hit areas , said that " dealing with the damage " will be a chief focus now			0
what is abundantly clear is that many people are hurting , the governor said before vowing , " we are here , and we will do everything possible to help			1
" " it 's traumatic , to say the least , to see your whole life turned upside down literally in a matter of minutes , " @entity16 said			0
@entity0 's @entity98 contributed to this report .			0

states of emergency are in effect in 15 counties throughout @entity8
1 woman is unaccounted for ; authorities have switched to a recovery mission , police say
governor : with better forecast , lower river levels , " we think the worst is behind us "
