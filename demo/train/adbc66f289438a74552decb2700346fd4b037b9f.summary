north of the capitol , @entity7 , raises questions about the secretive nation 's agenda			2
a satellite view of the nuclear facility at @entity5			2
@entity0 talked to two top @entity2 experts to gain insights into what @entity2 may be signaling , what it is realistically capable of accomplishing , and what the developments mean for its relations with the @entity20 @entity21 , the director of the @entity22 at the @entity23 , said the @entity2 announcement about restarting its nuclear facilities should come as " no surprise " to the @entity20			1
" @entity27 had said that they were going to do this			2
the @entity20 leadership made a mistake by going to the @entity34 because the @entity27 said on march 26 that if we went to the @entity34 , they would resume their nuclear program , " he said , referring to @entity2 's recent decision to launch a rocket despite international opposition			1
@entity21 visited @entity7 in january and does n't expect @entity2 to reprocess plutonium for at least a year			1
@entity38 may not even be their primary goal with this latest announcement , he said			1
" you have to put it all into context of the @entity2 situation , they want to negotiate to get economic help			2
all of this is a re-bargaining chip , " he said			2
" @entity49 are not hell - bent on nuclear weapons , this is just their opportunity , and they want to negotiate in bilateral talks with the @entity20			1
" " the @entity27 have shut down the six - party talks , but they have n't ruled out bilateral negotiations , " he said , referring to talks aimed at persuading @entity2 to scrap its nuclear program			1
the talks involved @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity2 , @entity60 , @entity61 and the @entity20			1
an additional part of @entity2 's re-bargaining chip may be two detained @entity20 journalists , he added			1
@entity2 has held @entity65 and @entity66 , reporters for @entity68 , since they were taken into custody along the @entity58 - @entity2 border on march 17			1
last week @entity2 said will try the two journalists on allegations of entering the country illegally and intending " hostile acts			1
" @entity21 said the @entity27 " are hoping the @entity20 will agree to bilateral talks in part because of the journalists they are holding , and the @entity20 knows @entity2 will ask something of them for the release of those journalists			1
" one of the main reasons @entity2 broke off the six - party talks was because it has n't received the energy and aid promised by other countries , @entity21 said			1
" @entity59 had promised energy to @entity2 that they have n't yet delivered , and this is energy that @entity2 desperately needs , " @entity21 said			1
" in all , we have delivered about one - third percent of the amount of energy we had promised the @entity2			1
" but what if the @entity27 do want to weaponize ? @entity94 , the co-director of the @entity95 at @entity96 , said he believes @entity2 can make bombs			2
" all they have to do is to extract the plutonium from the fuel rods which already exist in the cooling pool			0
they can now bring some of those fuel rods out and begin to take them through the reprocessing facility			0
it will take four to six months to reprocess all of the fuel rods			0
and they will be able to extract about a bomb and a half 's worth of plutonium from them , " @entity94 explained			2
@entity94 , who visited the @entity5 facility in late february 2008 , said he was quite certain the @entity27 will be able to convert the plutonium into a bomb in just a few additional months , added to the months spent reprocessing , if needed			0
" our greatest concern is that @entity2 will try to use this existing plutonium to conduct another nuclear test , " he said , referring to a 2006 effort by the @entity27			2
@entity94 explained that the fuel rods with the plutonium could n't be shipped easily during the first steps of disablement of the @entity5 plant and therefore were still intact when the @entity129 ( @entity129 ) inspectors left earlier this month			0
" the idea was the pool holding the fuel rods would be kept under close @entity129 inspection , " @entity94 said , " in essence , it was a pretty good hedge for the @entity27 all along ... the fuel rods and the reprocessing plant were the easiest part of the @entity5 plant to get going again , " he said			0
@entity94 said restarting the reactor is a different story			0
since the water cooling tower was destroyed in june 2008 , @entity94 said the @entity27 will likely rebuild the structure , which will take an estimated six months			0
he said they also need to process fresh fuel for the reactor , which will take about six months as well			0
" so in six months from now , they can reload the reactor			0
then the reactor would have to run for about two to three years to get another two bombs worth of plutonium , " he said			0
@entity94 cautions that he , too , tries to put the " complicated " situation in perspective			0
" we have to note that we 're dealing with disablement , not dismantlement			0
disablement means to make more difficult and not impossible to restart , " @entity94 said			0
" our greatest concern will be if the @entity27 will use the reprocessed plutonium to do another nuclear test			0

@entity38 may not be primary goal , @entity23 official says
@entity2 may be using two detained @entity20 journalists as bargaining chips , he adds
@entity2 said last week it will try @entity65 and @entity66
expert : @entity2 's ending of six - party talks *due* to energy , aid deal not being *honored*
