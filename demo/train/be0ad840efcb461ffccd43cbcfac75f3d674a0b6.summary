-- @entity2 - @entity2 farmers hoping for government settlement money in a racial bias case met with lawmakers wednesday and called on @entity6 to come up with a way to fund the $ 1 billion deal			1
litigation known as the @entity10 established a longstanding pattern of discrimination at the @entity14 @entity13 against @entity2 farmers who had applied for farm loans and support from federal programs			1
under the terms of an involved process overseen by a federal judge and dating to 1999 , qualified farmers could receive $ 50,000 each to settle claims of racial bias			1
in addition , @entity14 agriculture secretary @entity25 has said those farmers may pursue a claim for actual damages from the bias and potentially receive up to $ 250,000			1
@entity31 , executive director of the @entity32 , said wednesday that he believed that @entity6 was " very close " to coming up with a way to pay the settlement , which covers as many as 80,000 @entity2 farmers			1
" these farmers have suffered much , much too long , and it 's time that this thing get behind us			2
we can settle @entity10 once and for all and send a clear message to the country that we are on the right track as a nation , " @entity41 said at news conference			0
" we 're talking about much more than the money			0
we are talking about remedying past discrimination , " @entity41 said			0
a march 31 deadline to appropriate the funds has passed , and farmers now may withdraw from the settlement and pursue independent litigation against the government			2
@entity6 now has a target date of the end of may to come up with a plan			1
" we spend a billion dollars on a jet to go bomb somebody			0
we 're talking about a billion dollars to help feed our country , and i just do n't see why @entity6 and the president ca n't go ahead and find [ the funds ]			2
it is an emergency , " said @entity65 , with the @entity66			0
rep. @entity68 , @entity70 - @entity69 , said there is a " total commitment " from president @entity73 and the majority party in the @entity75 and @entity76 to make sure the settlement is taken care of			1
@entity68 represents his state 's @entity79 , which is home to @entity81 , who filed the class - action lawsuit more than a decade ago			2
@entity68 said lawmakers need to work out how to pay for the settlement under the @entity86 rule , meaning @entity6 must balance any increased spending with equal savings elsewhere			1
the other option would be to designate the settlement as an emergency , which would be exempt from @entity86			0
lawmakers are looking for an appropriate piece of legislation in which to include the settlement to avoid adding to the deficit , @entity68 said			1
" if we can not find the appropriate vehicle , then i would certainly support declaring this settlement as a national emergency and adding it to the next supplemental that may be on the @entity75 floor , " he said			0
farmers have until may 31 to withdraw from the pending class - action settlement and pursue an independent claim against the government if they feel their chances would be better for a payout			0
if they choose to stay in the class , they will wait as a group to apply for the promised monetary damages			0
@entity25 has said there 's no question the damages are due for @entity2 farmers			1
in a statement last week , he said , " i have met with and talked to key stakeholders and members of @entity6 reiterating the administration 's ongoing efforts to close this chapter in the history of the department			2
" @entity0 's @entity124 and @entity125 contributed to this report .			0

*advocates* say lawmakers are on their side , but they want them to speed up the process
rep. @entity68 says @entity6 needs to have a payment plan or declare an emergency
