@entity0 -- @entity3 schoolgirl activist @entity2 added her voice tuesday to calls for an end to female genital mutilation , a procedure affecting millions of women and girls worldwide			1
a global " @entity15 " is aimed at eradicating the practice , as well as child , early and forced marriage , within a generation			1
it 's being held in @entity0 , hosted by the @entity17 government along with @entity20 children 's agency @entity18			1
@entity18 estimates that at least 125 million women and girls around the world have been subjected to @entity24 , the " partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons			1
" as many as 30 million girls under the age of 15 may still be at risk , @entity18 says , although the practice appears to be declining			1
@entity24 is concentrated in 29 countries , mostly in @entity35 , according to the agency			1
generally done without anesthetic , it " can have lifelong health consequences including chronic infection , severe pain during urination , menstruation , sexual intercourse , and childbirth , and psychological trauma , " campaign group @entity37 states on its website			2
" no one knows how many girls die from @entity24			1
" according to @entity18 , " social acceptance " is the most frequently cited reason for supporting the continuation of the practice			1
the summit -- the first of its kind and attended by representatives of governments , grass - roots organizations , campaigners and survivors from around the world -- aims to change people 's ways of thinking			1
@entity2 said via @entity66 : " we should not be followers of traditions that go against human rights ... we are human beings and we make traditions			1
" @entity72 , who underwent the procedure at the age of 16 in @entity75 and now campaigns against @entity24 , told the summit that while she was cut , her daughters never would be			2
in a video produced ahead of the conference with the @entity79 , a @entity17 children 's charity , she told of the day her life was changed forever			0
it was a nice warm day , normal day			0
there was no idea it was going to happen , " she said			0
a room was already prepared for what is known in @entity75 as " the cutting , " she said			0
a friend of her mother 's sat on her chest to try to keep her quiet , @entity72 said , as she struggled against others who were pulling off her clothes and underwear			0
" she came in with a knife and little blades in her hands , " @entity72 said of the woman who carried out the procedure , who had been hired by her grandmother			0
" and a cloth was put in my mouth so i could n't scream			0
" she and a friend who was also cut were left alone in the room			0
" for the next four days we were just crying , no one cleaned us up , we were still bleeding			0
" the pain was just getting worse but she was unable to tell anyone , @entity72 said			0
" physically , emotionally , it affected me terribly			0
" prime minister @entity112 announced new @entity17 government measures tuesday to tackle the problem , a day after a major study revealed that an estimated 137,000 women are affected or at risk of @entity24 in @entity117 and @entity118			1
the @entity17 measures include legislation that will mean parents can be prosecuted if they fail to prevent their daughters being cut , as well as extra guidance for police and funding for support for survivors			0
" i 'll make reporting @entity24 mandatory for doctors , teachers and social workers			2
let 's end this abhorrent practice once and for all , " @entity112 said via @entity66			2
the new study , by @entity134 and campaign group @entity37 , is based on an examination of 2011 @entity17 census data , in an effort to determine how many women and girls have moved to the country from places where the practice of mutilation is common			1
the last major report on the problem in @entity117 and @entity118 , in 2007 , estimated that there were 66,000 women affected in the country and 24,000 at risk			2
the practice is illegal in the @entity17 , but many girls are taken back to their parents ' countries of origin for the procedure to be carried out			2
experts tie the practice to specific ethnic groups rather than a particular religion or country and say there 's a variety of justifications , including diminishing or controlling female sexual desire and ensuring a girl 's " marriageability			2
" @entity1 's @entity167 contributed to this report .			0
