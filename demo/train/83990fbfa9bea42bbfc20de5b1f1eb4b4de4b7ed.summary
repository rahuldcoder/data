-- this week marked a watershed event in the transfer of power from large companies to everyday people			2
when @entity7 proposed a $ 5 monthly debit fee in september , bank executives could only hope the customer backlash would n't be too extreme			1
but 22 - year - old @entity10 , a recent college graduate working two part - time jobs , was incredulous that a bank just bailed out by @entity15 taxpayers would add a new fee to increase its profits while it laid off employees			1
@entity19 did n't just get mad ; she decided to take action by launching a petition on @entity10 to stop the fee			2
@entity19 knew she was n't the only one fed up with the banks ' overreach , and thought that if enough customers joined her campaign , @entity7 would be forced to listen			1
within a month , more than 300,000 people from all 50 states had joined @entity19 's campaign , @entity7 's @entity30 and @entity31 properties were deluged with negative comments and media coverage started pouring in			1
a @entity7 executive personally called @entity10 to try to address her concerns and its ceo had to defend his consumer - unfriendly plan on national television as complaints mounted from bank customers and others			1
@entity19 's campaign also inspired dozens of other people to start their own petitions on @entity10 challenging their own banks to drop new proposed fees			1
within weeks , other major financial institutions like @entity53 , @entity54 , and @entity55 bowed to the public pressure and dropped their debit fee plans			0
finally , on tuesday , @entity19 woke up in her shared @entity59 apartment to an incredible announcement : @entity7 was dropping its fee because of massive " customer concerns			0
" the campaign to get @entity7 to drop its fees had won			0
ten years ago , companies could make unilateral decisions without worrying much about their customers organizing against them			2
a customer like @entity19 might have reacted to @entity7 's new fee by changing banks , but there would have been no way for her to connect to hundreds of thousands of other disaffected customers to enact a coordinated response			1
social media has radically changed this dynamic , and tools like @entity10 , @entity30 and @entity31 empower everyday people like @entity19 to launch , drive and win campaigns against even the largest corporations in ways not previously possible			1
this power shift is already starting to have deep impact			0
it 's not just that companies are now forced to publicly face concerns expressed by mobilized customers ; it 's that the knowledge that any significant decision will be exposed and could result in coordinated backlash is causing companies to pre-emptively change their policies to better reflect the interests of their customers and stakeholders			0
this is not just good news for consumers -- it 's good for society			0
with hundreds of new campaigns started every day on @entity10 , we see this impact up close			0
companies not only regularly contact us to see how they can address concerns raised by people who petition them through our platform , but they also let us know they are pre-emptively addressing concerns that @entity10 members are petitioning their competitors to change			2
although companies have enormous influence over our communities , ranging from the environment to public health to workers rights to politics , they are often largely unaccountable on these issues			0
but in a world where social media is making the actions of companies transparent and enabling consumers to hold them accountable through frictionless mass mobilization , this is changing			1
as a result , companies will increasingly have a choice : do the right thing or face the wrath of a million @entity134			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity137 .			0
