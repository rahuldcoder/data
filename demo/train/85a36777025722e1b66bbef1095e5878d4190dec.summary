@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity4 secretary of state @entity3 said wednesday she took on the " complicated and difficult " task of trying to restart talks on @entity9 - @entity8 peace during her talks with @entity0 's leaders			1
@entity0 is " an essential partner " in that effort , she said			1
" president @entity18 , special envoy [ @entity20 ] @entity19 -- who is here with me today -- and i are all deeply and personally committed to achieving a two - state solution and comprehensive peace between @entity9 , @entity8 and all of their @entity25 neighbors , " @entity15 said at a joint news conference with @entity0 foreign minister @entity17			1
she spoke on the final stop on her weeklong trip that stretched from @entity28 to the @entity29			2
@entity15 met with @entity17 and other @entity0 leaders before consulting wednesday with @entity0 president @entity31			2
@entity15 angered @entity8 leaders during her stop saturday in @entity34 when she praised @entity9 for what she called " unprecedented " steps to limit -- but not fully halt -- the construction of @entity39 settlements			1
@entity0 leaders told @entity15 her statement was perceived as " a sort of backtracking " and " listened with great interest " as she insisted the @entity4 opposition to settlements has not changed , @entity17 said			1
" we talked about this very clearly and very candidly , " he said , noting that @entity0 feels that @entity9 " is hindering the process " by continuing its settlement activities			1
@entity15 again clarified the @entity4 position at wednesday 's news conference in @entity1 : " our policy on settlements has not changed			1
i want to say that again : our policy on settlement activity has not changed , " she said			2
" we do not accept the legitimacy of settlement activity			0
and we have a very firm belief that ending all activity -- current and future -- would be preferable , and that is what we have put forth , and that is what we have continued to support			0
" but @entity8 frustration over @entity15 's statement in @entity34 and the stalled peace process was still on display wednesday in the @entity71 city of @entity72			2
@entity73 , chief negotiator for the @entity74 , said that if @entity9 settlement construction did not end , it may be " the moment of truth " for the @entity8 leadership			1
@entity73 raised the possibility that " the two - state solution is no longer an option and maybe the @entity8 people should refocus their attention to the one - state solution where @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity39 can live as equal			0
" @entity9 is opposed to any notion of a " one - state solution , " seeing it as a fundamental threat to the @entity39 nature of the state			0
however , @entity9 prime minister @entity94 has been reluctant to embrace the idea of a two - state solution , something the @entity4 and others see as the only way to resolve the @entity9 - @entity8 conflict			1
@entity15 returns to @entity101 later wednesday			0
she said she felt " very satisfied by what we accomplished on this trip " despite the complex issues at hand			0
" every issue that we touched on during this trip is complicated and difficult ; each requires patience , perseverance and determination to see them through , " @entity15 said			0
" if these were easy questions with simple answers , i would not have made this trip			0
" she said that a key part of getting the peace process back on track is improving the image of the @entity4 in the region			0
" it is important to recognize that after a period of time in which the @entity4 ' position was rejected or was certainly questioned , what we are doing is very carefully and consistently rebuilding those bonds , creating those partnerships , finding common ground so we and our international partners will be able to make progress , " she said			2
when asked for a timeline of the resumption of @entity9 - @entity8 talks , @entity15 would only say , " we are working hard to see that happen			1
i 'm not going to make predictions			0
