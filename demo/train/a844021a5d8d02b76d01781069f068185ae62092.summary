" zing ! least pleasant surprise : @entity55			2
and i mean that as a compliment			2
the brassy comic , who was just fired from " @entity61 , " showed up unannounced to school the rest of the roasters on how an insult is really dished out			2
most cringe - inducing roast : i love " @entity67 's " @entity66 , but his out - of - nowhere jokes about how the last living " @entity69 " is a racist abortion addict were met with uncomfortable silence			1
he would have done better to give @entity2 the same lap dance he gave to @entity73 in " the proposal			1
" go - to audience morale booster : @entity77 reaction shots			0
best topical references -- there were not one , not two , but three shout - outs to @entity83 's recent sex scandal , the best of which was in a pre-taped bit by @entity86			1

she summed it up best with her opening jab : " yesterday , i was talking to the president of the @entity5			0
today i 'm talking to a bunch of second - rate comedians and a dog			0
" @entity14 stuck to " this is what it 's come to " eye rolls and dry - as - a - bone jokes over the tawdry topics that tend to populate these ceremonies			2
speaking of which ... least surprising joke trend : " @entity2 is an old slut			1
" these words were never actually uttered , of course , but the writing was all over the wall			0
not to say the jokes were n't hilarious			0
some highlights : -- @entity14 , in a rare copulation joke : " [ @entity146 was ] the first woman to do @entity148 in the @entity149 — literally , she did him in the balcony			0

her tramp stamp is in @entity186			0
" - @entity187 : " @entity188 was the first roast you attended			2
" best passive - aggressive retaliation : rounding out the ceremony , @entity2 skipped the traditional chance to fire back at her roasters ( because @entity55 " stole all [ her ] material " )			1
