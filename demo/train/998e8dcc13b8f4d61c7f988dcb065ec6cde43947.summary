-- gadget fans waiting anxiously for the next @entity2 to be released may be reaching the home stretch			0
@entity4 , which has made no official announcement , is planning a september 12 event at which the next generation of the iconic smartphone will presumably be announced , according to multiple reports			1
@entity10 , an @entity4 - oriented blog , was the first to report that " sources who have proven accurate in the past " said the phone will be introduced at an event that day and released nine days later			1
observers are calling it the @entity2 5 , although no name has been announced			0
others , including the @entity22 's @entity21 blog , followed with similar reports			0
quoting anonymous sources at @entity4 , @entity21 said an event is planned for the week of september 9			1
the 12th would be a wednesday , which follows with previous @entity4 events			2
a september release would be slightly ahead of @entity4 's established one - iphone - per - year pace			1
but the @entity30 took longer than usual , its october unveiling coming about 16 months after the @entity2			1
a fall iphone release has been considered a foregone conclusion by most observers for months			0
speculation has focused on a handful of expected new features , including a slightly larger screen , a smaller dock connector and @entity41 technology that would make it easier for shoppers to make payments through their phones			0
@entity10 also says that the mythical " @entity47 " will be unveiled at the event			1
speculation has increasingly ramped up that @entity4 , faced by competition from @entity51 's @entity50 and @entity54 's @entity53 tablets , is making a smaller version of the @entity47			1
the move would fly in the face of statements made by the late @entity4 ceo @entity59 , who favored full - size tablets			1
but @entity4 faces unprecedented competition in the space and may argue that screen technology that would have made a smaller @entity47 impractical before is now available			1
on the smartphone front , @entity4 also faces a landscape that 's arguably more challenging than it 's seen in a while			2
the @entity2 is still the most popular handset in the field , but the total number of phones running @entity54 's @entity71 operating system has been greater for some time			0
and while competitors in the past have arguably spent the time between @entity2 releases trying to catch up , many reviewers feel that several models among the current crop of @entity71 phones have surpassed the @entity30 in terms of features and performance			2
notably , the @entity82 has topped 10 million in sales in two months -- a number it took the @entity86 five months to hit			2
reviewers have praised its bigger screen , sleek design and a set of new features			0
the @entity30 was , in some senses , a glorified update of the @entity2 , with its advances coming in new software features and improved camera and display			2
it outsold its predecessor , although with anticipation high for the looming @entity101 , sales have begun to flag			0
according to its recent earnings report , @entity4 shipped 26 million iphones from april to june , which was less than the 28 million to 29 million that @entity106 analysts had predicted			0
it was a steep drop from the 35.1 million that the company sold in the previous quarter .			0

a september 12 event would be 11 months after @entity30 rolled out
@entity4 has made no official announcement
some say a smaller " @entity47 " also could be announced
@entity4 faces unprecedented phone competition , slipping sales
