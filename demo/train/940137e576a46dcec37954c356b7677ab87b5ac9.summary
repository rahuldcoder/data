@entity0 -- it 's the time of year when hammers are poised at the world 's major auction houses and the strength of the art market for the coming year is tested			1
following a trend set in the last few years , @entity9 and modern works of art are likely to be the big sellers			2
" impressionist and modern art has been very strong for a number of years , but it seems to be getting stronger and stronger , " said @entity13 , @entity14 at @entity16 auction house in @entity0			1
" it 's amazing really , even with the huge financial problems that have been happening worldwide , " she said			0
@entity16 clocked sales for works by @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 at their @entity28 and @entity29 tuesday			1
the star lots included a @entity26 portrait of a woman and a @entity27 painting of @entity34 in @entity35 , which sold for £ 1.3 million and $ 1.4 million ( £ 825,250 and £ 864,450 ) respectively , both just shy of their $ 1.6 million upper estimates			1
on the same day , three works of art from the @entity42 collection fetched a combined £ 13.7 million ( $ 21.7m ) at @entity44 's auction house , more than doubling their pre-sale low estimate of £ 6.2 million			2
an additional 35 works from the film star 's fine art collection will be offered for sale on 8 february as part of @entity44 's continuing sales series devoted to @entity9 and @entity53 over at @entity56 's auction house in @entity0 , auctioneers also anticipate a healthy sale wednesday , with star lots in the form of paintings by @entity61 and @entity63 painter @entity62			1
dating from 1901 , the painting by @entity62 depicts the shore of a lake , bordered by birch trees , and is estimated to sell for between $ 9.5 million and $ 13 million ( £ 6 million and £ 8 million )			0
it is particularly unique because it has been in the same family collection for over 100 years , said @entity70 , chairman of @entity28 and @entity53 , @entity72			0
see also : @entity73 : the man , the myth , the mystery " ( the painting ) has n't been seen in a public exhibition or appeared at auction and it 's rather exciting for the market place because that sort of thing only happens very rarely , " she said			0
interest in the @entity86 symbolist painter , perhaps best - known for his 1907 painting " @entity89 " -- which sold in 2006 for a reported $ 135 million , at the time the highest sum ever paid for a painting -- has been steadily growing these last few years			0
a landscape painting by @entity62 , which had been stolen by the @entity93 and eventually returned to the heir of the original owner , sold at @entity56 in @entity96 in november 2011 for $ 40.4 million			2
with 2012 marking the 150th anniversary of the artist 's birth , it is quite possible that the 1901 work " @entity102 with birches " will smash its upper estimate at @entity56 on wednesday			0
also included in the sale is a painting of a snowy landscape by @entity28 artist @entity61 , which like the @entity62 is entering the market after a long period -- nearly 100 years -- in a private collection			2
it is expected to sell for between $ 7 million and $ 10 million ( £ 4.5 million and £ 6.5 million )			0
" it 's from the mid- 1880s , when @entity61 was at @entity113 , " said @entity111 of @entity56 's			1
" there was an account of some snow falling and ( @entity61 ) immediately muffled himself up and went out and put his easel on the road in order to capture en plein air the extraordinary effect of the light , " she explained			0
despite a rocky year in the financial markets , @entity111 believes that the range and depth of works in the sale at @entity56 reflects confidence in the market			1
see also : @entity27 , @entity133 works stolen in @entity135 heist " @entity137 have recognized that there is a huge global demand for a whole range of collectors both established and relatively new who are looking to buy top quality material of @entity28 and modern art , " she said			1
@entity145 at @entity16 echoed this , saying that the market for @entity9 and modern art is particularly strong because as less great works with historical provenance come on the market , they become more and more expensive			1
" i think also with the true globalization of buyers , ( the market is now ) so international , and with the internet and internet bidding , it 's so easy to access our sales ( and ) it 's really changed the market , " she said			0
and paintings by @entity9 escape a recently implemented @entity160 's @entity159 , which applies to @entity72 artists who have died in the past 70 years as well as living @entity72 artists -- though @entity111 does n't believe the charge , which caps at a maximum of 12,500 euros ( $ 16,500 ) on a transaction , will deter buyers			2
" the average lot value in our evening sale is £ 1.5 million ( $ 1.9 million ) so in the grand scheme of things i do n't anticipate that it will have a measurable effect , " said @entity111 .			0

impressionist and modern auction sales kick off in @entity0 ; will test the strength of the global art market
*popularity* for @entity9 and modern artworks still high , in spite of problems in the global financial markets
star lots of sales at @entity16 and @entity56 's include paintings by @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity26 and @entity27
prices stay high because of rarity of great works by @entity9 and modern artists with historical provenance
