-- it might be better to travel than arrive , but in the case of @entity4 footballers succeeding abroad the journey has all too often been painful -- and all too frequently they have returned home after barely arriving			1
quite what @entity8 's $ 134 million journey to @entity9 brings is open to conjecture , but with his painfully protracted transfer now concluded , the hard part really begins			1
the spotlight on a @entity4 footballer on a global stage has never been greater , with the 24 - year - old having eclipsed @entity17 as the world 's most expensive player of all time			1
but there are no guarantees that @entity8 will live up to the price tag nor shine in @entity24			1
after all , many of the great and good of @entity4 football have faltered away from home			1
" why are there over the last 40 years only about five @entity32 players who have done well abroad ? " said @entity29 great @entity28 , who both played for and coached @entity9 's rivals @entity30			1
" there 's something going on there , something strange			2
" @entity36 was the first @entity4 footballer to ply his trade overseas professionally in 1891 and he was a founding member of @entity39 club @entity38 eight years later			1
there have been others to have made their mark since : @entity43 at @entity44 , @entity45 at @entity30 and , most recently , @entity46 at @entity9 , @entity38 and @entity47			1
but for the successes , there have been under - performances and failures , ranging from @entity52 , who was famously but falsely quoted as saying his spell in @entity44 was " like playing in a foreign country , " to fellow striker @entity55 , who managed just four goals in 28 games at @entity30			2
the language barrier is often given as the main reason for the initial struggle for @entity61 who have failed to settle			1
it is no surprise that among those to shine were the players who swotted up on the lingo early on			0
@entity67 began @entity39 lessons while still at @entity69 -- a move to @entity71 then just a possibility -- while @entity73 mastered @entity74 quickly to become at ease almost instantly with @entity9 teammates and fans alike			1
looking back on his foreign sojourn , @entity45 recalled : " i looked at @entity4 players who went abroad and were successful			1
they were the ones who learned the language and adapted to the culture			1
the ones that did n't tended to be home pretty quickly			0
" one of the current crop of @entity4 on the continent is @entity88 , currently with @entity90 side @entity89 , who has also had spells with @entity39 sides in five seasons away from home so far			1
" leaving home and settling in was difficult , " he said of the early days abroad			2
" the complete change of culture from food , people , climate and mainly the language was challenging			1
" the language is the most important thing , not knowing it isolates you and stops you from expressing your personality and prevents you from understanding simple messages on and off the pitch			2
" read more : @entity8 becomes latest ' galactico ' @entity52 never really mastered the language and , as a result , felt a lonely figure in the @entity44 dressing room while @entity113 made no secret of being homesick while in @entity115 with @entity116 as he never managed more than a few token phrases of @entity39			1
@entity118 , who won three league titles in @entity120 with @entity121 as well as reaching the @entity123 final , said that it took three months to learn the language and , after that , he slotted right in			2
but language is not the sole barrier , the cultural differences as a whole are a more deep - rooted issue for many , and , like with @entity132 , plain old home sickness			1
@entity52 used to get his family to bring over digestive biscuits while former @entity137 goalkeeper @entity136 , who spent two seasons in @entity139 with @entity140 , repeatedly bemoaned a lack of baked beans			0
@entity143 is a young @entity32 player who has been in @entity144 since the age of 16			0
he initially joined @entity146 in the @entity29 capital of @entity148 and now , aged 21 , plays for @entity150 's under - 23 team			0
his advice for @entity8 would be to immerse himself in the @entity74 culture , which in turn will help him settle into the @entity9 way of life			1
" the great thing about moving to a new country is all the new experiences , " @entity156 - born @entity143 told @entity0			0
" if you do n't put too much pressure on yourself , you can really enjoy it			2
" i would say learn the most you can about the @entity74 culture and become a part of it			1
i lived in an @entity32 culture for 16 years , moved here and it 's completely different			2
it 's so great the culture here , i 'm involved in it			2
" for others , the issue was of being the virtual alien in the midst of a new bunch of players			0
@entity177 was a huge success story abroad with a spell at @entity180 , which resulted in two @entity182 titles and with him twice being named @entity183			2
but things started far from well , with reports that some players would not even pass to him in training , unhappy he had been brought to the @entity90 club			0
so , playing abroad -- for a @entity190 or otherwise -- takes a certain strength of character			2
former @entity194 striker @entity193 admitted he was n't up to such a culture shock , leaving @entity74 side @entity196 after just three appearances for the club			1
so how exactly does @entity8 avoid falling into the trap of some of his esteemed predecessors ? after all , @entity9 fans can be a heartless bunch , whatever the price tag			1
one former player , @entity206 , another @entity190 , was voted the worst signing of the @entity208 in a poll by @entity74 newspaper @entity210			1
" the world has been littered with @entity32 players who have n't adjusted to being a big player at a @entity215 club , " journalist @entity216 , who has regularly crossed paths with @entity8 during his meteoric rise over the past three years , told @entity0			1
" he knows he is a disposal commodity			0
if he does n't perform he is toast			0
" making sure he does not fall by the wayside particularly with the size and variety of expectation -- from what he does on the field to off it -- is the big trick			0
" @entity9 and @entity237 are looking at him as helping them launch into a completely different commercial market , " added @entity216 , author of the recently published " @entity232 , " which looks at football 's unknown football talent spotters -- a club 's scouts			1
" they want him to do a @entity46 and his world is going to change irrevocably			0
he is right up in the upper strata			0
" is this a top three player and can he drive that commercial momentum ? can he operate in the same side as @entity17 ? is he @entity17 lite ? will he have physical weaknesses ? it is unique opportunity and unique challenge			0
" he will need that foundation stone of his family and his friends			0
it is a huge leap from being the boy at home playing @entity256 to being the hope of world football			0
" @entity216 , though , also makes the point that @entity8 is no innocent bystander in all this			2
" the whole scorpion dance of a big move comes in , " added @entity216			0
" he understands his clout			0
he is not an innocent			0
people in his situation are n't innocent			0
they are products of an occasionally brutal world			0
" in @entity74 , there is the goldfish bowl aspect for @entity8 to encounter along with his partner @entity270 , bigger at @entity9 than at most clubs in the world			1
already , @entity8 has made about a third of @entity74 newspaper @entity210 's front pages in august alone			1
on the issue of the media spotlight , @entity216 said : " his parents are model parents and helped him get through an academy system , which is predisposed to producing bad dads and mad mums			0
" that value structure will come under unprecedented scrutiny and he will have to quickly get used to the current absurdities of that world			0
that 's where he is going to have to readjust and recalibrate his life			2
" it could go a number of ways			0
he could become @entity43 , nicknamed the gentle giant and voted @entity44 ' greatest foreign import above @entity293 and @entity294 , or else @entity295 , who is still talked favorably about by the @entity296 after winning the @entity297 in his first season with @entity9			2
or else he could do down the @entity206 route , of being reviled rather than revered			0
the eyes of the world will be watching which way it goes .			0

@entity8 faces pressure to live up to $ 134 million price tag at @entity9
language barrier has often *hindered* @entity4 footballers abroad
@entity8 advised to immerse himself in @entity74 culture
but @entity313 can expect life in a goldfish bowl at @entity9
