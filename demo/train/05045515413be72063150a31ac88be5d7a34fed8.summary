-- most @entity1 told pollsters they disapproved of the @entity4 military operation that killed @entity6 leader @entity5 and the direction their country was headed , according to a poll released tuesday by the @entity11			1
in all , nearly two - thirds ( 63 % ) expressed disapproval of the raid , while only 10 % said they approved of it			1
in addition , about half of @entity1 ( 51 % ) said they think the may 2 raid on @entity5 's home in @entity20 will adversely affect their country 's relations with the @entity4			1
just 4 % said they think relations will improve			0
nevertheless , most @entity1 said they would like to see a strong relationship between the countries			1
but a survey taken just after the raid found no material change in @entity1 ' views of the @entity4 when compared with results from a survey taken before the raid			1
only 12 % of respondents said they had a positive view of the @entity4 and 8 % said they were confident that @entity4 president @entity36 would do the right thing in world affairs			1
@entity36 's approval numbers are no better than those of then - president @entity41 in 2008			2
in a poll taken after @entity5 's death , more than two - thirds ( 69 % ) said they think of the @entity4 as more of an enemy			1
but that figure is not significantly higher than the 68 % who said the same thing in a poll before his death			0
@entity52 's government stirred warmer feelings , with just 1 % of @entity1 identifying it as an enemy			2
those surveyed said they were confused about the role of the @entity1 government in the @entity4 military operation in @entity20 , which is located about 35 miles outside the capital city of @entity62			1
asked whether they believe the @entity1 government authorized the raid , 29 % said it did , 23 % said it did not and nearly half said they did not know			1
@entity4 officials have said they did not consult with their @entity1 counterparts prior to the raid			1
fewer than one in five @entity1 ( 18 % ) said they think the government did know that @entity5 was hiding in @entity20 , 29 % said they did not think so and more than half ( 53 % ) had no opinion			2
meanwhile , @entity1 support for the government 's anti-terrorism efforts has diminished over the past few years			0
slightly more than a third ( 37 % ) said they support using the @entity1 army to fight extremists in the @entity80 and the @entity82 region , which used to be called the @entity83			2
two years ago , more than half ( 53 % ) said they backed using the army to battle @entity87 - affiliated groups in the @entity89 area			0
at the same time , fear of extremists taking over @entity1 has dropped from 69 % two years ago to 55 % today , according to the poll			0
yet extremist groups are still unpopular , with just 12 % of @entity1 expressing a positive view of @entity6 , down from 18 % last year			1
and 12 % rated the @entity87 favorably			1
approval of @entity96 was higher , with 27 % expressing support for the @entity99 - based group that has carried out attacks in neighboring @entity101			0
the figures came from two in - person interview surveys carried out by the @entity11 's @entity104			0
the first was carried out april 10 - 26 and included 1,970 @entity1 who were part of a 23 - nation poll			0
the second was conducted may 8 - 15 -- after @entity5 was killed -- solely in @entity1 among 1,251 @entity1			2
the pollsters said there were few differences between the first and second surveys , implying that @entity5 's killing had little impact on public opinion in @entity1 about the @entity4 or other issues covered by the survey			2
@entity1 showed little support for a number of @entity4 foreign policy features , with just 20 % saying they think the @entity4 considers interests of countries like @entity1 in setting foreign policy and 69 % saying they want @entity4 and @entity126 troops out of @entity127			1
nearly two - thirds ( 62 % ) said they oppose @entity4 - led efforts to fight terrorism			1
but @entity1 expressed deep unhappiness with their own country 's leadership , with 92 % saying they are dissatisfied with the country 's direction and 85 % saying the country 's economic situation is bad			2
the long - term outlook is not much better -- 60 % predicted the country 's economy will get worse in the coming 12 months vs. 13 % who predicted it will improve			0
the popularity of president @entity144 has plummeted , from 20 % last year to 11 % during this survey			0
his prime minister , @entity146 , attracted a positive rating from 37 % of those surveyed , down from 59 % last year			0
opposition leader @entity149 of the @entity150 drew a positive rating from 63 % , down from 71 % last year			1
and former cricket star @entity152 attracted the most favorable rating for a politician with 68 % approval of those surveyed , up from 52 % last year			0
despite the criticism endured by the military over its absentee status during the @entity4 raid on @entity5 's compound , 79 % of @entity1 described the military as a positive influence on the country			1
perhaps that 's because only about a third ( 37 % ) of @entity1 said they followed closely reports about the raid that killed @entity5			2
the prospect of violence against civilians appears to carry little cachet among @entity1 , with 85 % saying suicide bombing and other violent acts against civilians in defense of @entity176 are never justified vs. 38 % who said the same thing in 2002			2
and terrorism was deemed to be either a very big problem or a moderately big problem by 97 % of those questioned			0
but support for @entity4 drone attacks remains minuscule , with 97 % of those who had heard of them saying they are bad and 65 % saying they are very bad			0
but just 27 % said they had heard a lot about the attacks , up from 14 % last year			0
more than half ( 61 % ) said they are unnecessary and 89 % said they think they kill too many innocent people			0
the sampling error was plus - or - minus 3 points in the april survey and plus - or - minus 4 points in the may survey .			0

nearly two - thirds ( 63 % ) expressed disapproval of the raid
most @entity1 said they wanted a strong relationship between the two countries
only 12 % said they had a positive view of the @entity4
just 8 % said they were confident that @entity36 would do the right thing in world affairs
