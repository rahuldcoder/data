residents have turned in lost cash across the tsunami zone at a much higher rate than usual , the @entity11 tells @entity1			0
a police spokesman , who asked not to be identified , citing department policy , said he could not specify how much cash has been turned in to lost - and - found offices at police stations			2
but , he said , of the 24 police stations across @entity22 , nine of them are on the @entity26 coastline			0
@entity6 's cultural mores remain strong between march 12 , the day following the earthquake and tsunami , and march 31 , those nine police stations collected 10 times the amount of lost cash collected at the other 15 stations combined			1
@entity6 children , from a young age , are taught to turn in any lost items , including cash , to police stations			1
