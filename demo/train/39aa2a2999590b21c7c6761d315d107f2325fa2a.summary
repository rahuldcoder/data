-- though " @entity3 " and " @entity4 " are history , " @entity2 " -- for now -- is firmly ensconced in @entity6 's daytime lineup			1
but since ratings are n't as strong as they used to be -- the show 's averaging a 1.1 rating among adults women 18 - 49 , down 21 percent from last year -- and given how @entity11 's syndicated talk show is coming to @entity6 stations this fall , it 's still possible that the good people of @entity15 may lose their home in daytime			1
but it could have a future in primetime : @entity0 has confirmed that @entity6 entertainment chief @entity22 is pondering one scenario that would allow the soap to air as an evening summer series			2
not a bad thought , right ? granted , it 's not exactly a new idea : @entity29 used to air primetime specials of " @entity31 " that averaged anywhere from 11.5 million to 13.7 million			2
but those aired in the ' 90s , when there was far less competition for eyeballs			0
even then , the network realized they were n't exactly bringing the house down so it stopped airing them after 1998			0
it may be hard for @entity6 to pull off financially			0
at a reported $ 200,000 per episode , a primetime episode of " gh " is still a lot cheaper to make rather than an original for a scripted show ( which can ring in at well over $ 1 million )			1
a move to summer nights would certainly buy @entity6 some good will with daytime fans , who are still reeling over the cancellations of " @entity3 " and " @entity4 " -- especially since a plan to continue them online was quashed late last year			2
there 's always the chance that " gh " would stay put , but that 's looking unlikely			2
back when @entity11 's talk show deal with @entity6 - @entity58 was announced , the company also said it would be giving the last hour of daytime back to its affiliates in september 2012			0
that 's the hour currently occupied by " @entity2 , " which airs either at 2 p.m. or 3 p.m. across the country			1
once it gives that fourth hour back to the stations , @entity6 will only have three to fill but four shows to do it with -- " @entity65 , " " @entity2 , " " @entity66 " and " @entity67			1
" ( @entity11 will be airing on the @entity6 owned - and - operated stations )			0
there 's a chance that one -- or both -- of the latter programs will fail , which means " @entity2 " could continue to have a spot on the lineup			1
but lifestyle shows , unlike soaps , are more relevant and profitable			1
for one , they are cheaper to make			1
two , they can spawn side businesses like cookbooks			0
the same ca n't be said for the aging daytime soap genre			0
