-- the big summer showdown has come and gone			0
the @entity2 decided the @entity3 could stand , and so it remains , for the most part , undisturbed			1
the next hurdle will occur in november , when the country goes to the polls			0
for the sake of argument , though , let 's assume the health care law will not be stripped down by a new president and @entity13			1
in which case , we need to start asking an important question : what will happen with @entity18 ? many @entity19 still do n't understand how @entity18 works			1
the biggest misperception is that @entity18 is a universal health care program for all poor people			1
that 's just not true			1
many people with little to no income do not qualify for @entity26			2
yes , all children up to 100 % of the poverty line , and children under 6 up to 133 % of poverty line , are covered			0
pregnant women up to 133 % of the poverty line are covered as well			0
so are elderly and disabled @entity19 who qualify for @entity34 's @entity33			2
but there 's where things start to break down			2
parents are covered , but only to 1996 welfare levels			0
this keeps a lot of parents , even those who are very poor , from qualifying for @entity18			1
two parents and a child living in @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 or @entity48 with an income of $ 4,850 a year actually earn too much to qualify for traditional medicaid			0
and if you 're not a parent , then things are even worse			0
in most states , if you have no children , you ca n't qualify for @entity18 no matter how little you make			1
in most states , even if you make no money at all , there 's no @entity18 for you			1
this means @entity18 is far from the safety net many imagine it to be			1
it has so many holes that when the heath care law really gets going in 2014 , more than half ( @entity65 ) of the newly insured will be those earning less than 133 % of the poverty line			1
the poor still constitute a significant percent of the uninsured			2
when the @entity73 and the @entity74 were debating how to cover all of the uninsured , they disagreed			0
both bodies agree that those making more than 133 % of the poverty line should get private insurance in the exchanges , albeit with subsidies for those making less than 400 % of the poverty line			0
but what to do with those making less than 133 % of the poverty line ? the @entity87 favored the idea of expanding @entity18 , as @entity18 is cheaper than private insurance			1
in fact , so much so that the @entity73 pushed to raise the eligibility for @entity18 for all @entity19 to 133 % of the poverty line , above the @entity74 's suggested 100 % , as it made the entire @entity3 cheaper			1
this is a radical change for @entity18			1
it will finally be the fully universal safety net that many believe it already is			1
all @entity19 , regardless of age and parental status , will qualify if they are poor			2
this wo n't be cheap , of course			0
states currently are on the hook for 50 % to 75 % of all @entity18 costs			1
asking them to cover the many millions of newly eligible recipients would be too much for many to bear			0
therefore , the federal government decided it would pay for the full cost of the expansion when it begins in 2014			1
there are two problems , though			0
the first is that the federal portion decreases to 90 % by 2020			0
that may still sound like a great deal , but even that 10 % is a lot of money , and many states fear they wo n't have it			2
the second is that the individual mandate and @entity3 in general will probably bring forward a lot of people who already qualified for @entity18 and just never signed up			1
the federal government wo n't pay for them , and a lot of states fear this expense			2
they feared it so much that they brought a case against the expansion that made it all the way to the @entity2			2
the court decided in the states ' favor			2
the health care law can ask states to expand @entity18 and offer them extra money if they will agree to the expansion			1
the law can even refuse states the extra money if they refuse to expand the program			1
but what the law ca n't do is threaten states with removal of their traditional @entity18 money if they wo n't expand			1
what this means is that states are free to say no to the @entity18 expansion			1
that will mean some big problems in implementing the @entity3			1
there are really no provisions for people making less than 100 % of the poverty lines to receive subsidies to buy insurance on the exchanges			2
many will not be penalized by the mandate because they make too little ( @entity65 ) , but that will still leave them without health insurance			1
in essence , without the @entity18 expansion , millions of the poorest among us will still be uninsured , with few options to rectify the situation			1
i still believe that few states will choose to refuse the expansion money			1
it 's hard to say no to a full funding of insurance for millions of constituents when it will cost you nothing			1
moreover , it will be politically difficult to say no when so many other states are saying yes			0
there will also be enormous pressure from physicians , hospitals and other providers , who stand to lose a ton of money if people are n't insured			0
let 's remember that there were holdouts when @entity18 was passed decades ago			1
today , threatening to take away that program is " coercive			0
" that said , plenty of states have shown their willingness to turn down such deals in the past			0
likely , some will in the future			0
they are certainly threatening to already			0
since those threats are nothing more than words at the moment , i 'd take them with a grain of salt			0
but that does n't mean a few wo n't hold fast			0
there are ways to fix this , of course			0
subsidies could be provided for everyone , for instance			0
states could ask for new deals			0
or the federal government could make the expansion a federal burden for all time			2
the various solutions will cost money and require compromise			0
that 's not happening soon			0
so , for the moment , we will wait			0
on november 7 , we will have a better idea of whether the @entity3 will stand			2
and maybe then , we 'll be able to get to work			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity237 .			2

@entity237 : it 's not true that @entity18 is a universal health care program for all poor people
@entity237 : @entity18 has a chance to become a full safety net under the @entity3
but states are free to say no to the @entity18 expansion under the health care law , he says
@entity237 : we 'll have to make compromises , but first let 's see if law will be stripped down
