@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity5 host @entity4 is going back to late nights after a low - rated experiment in prime time , the network announced sunday			1
@entity4 's prime - time talk show , which debuted in september , " did n't meet affiliates ' needs , " said @entity9 , chairman of @entity10			1
the program will go off the air february 12 , when the @entity17 begin			0
the network is now negotiating with @entity4 and its current late - night hosts , @entity20 and @entity21 , to decide who ends up with which time slot , @entity9 said			2
@entity20 took over @entity5 's flagship " @entity26 " when @entity4 moved to the 10 p.m. slot in september			1
@entity27 took over @entity20 's former show , " @entity29			2
" @entity9 said the plan now is for @entity4 to host a new , half - hour show at 11:35 p.m. et , followed by " tonight " with @entity20 at 12:05 a.m. @entity27 's show would move to the 1 a.m. hour , he said			1
do you think @entity5 did the right thing ? the goal is to keep all three hosts , but nothing was a done deal as of sunday , he said			0
reports of the shakeup first emerged last week			0
@entity4 dismissed them on his show on thursday night , telling his audience , " it 's always been my experience @entity5 only cancels you when you 're in first place			2
" @entity4 's move to prime time was a risk for @entity5 , because it put a talk show up against scripted prime - time shows and ran it five days a week			1
network spokeswoman @entity53 said last week that @entity4 performed " exactly as we anticipated on the network			0
" but for @entity5 's affiliates , @entity4 's low ratings were taking viewers -- and the resulting ad dollars -- away from their late local newscasts			1
" the 11 o'clock news hours were bleeding ratings , " said @entity61 , an analyst for the entertainment trade paper variety			0
while @entity5 appeared to be fine with @entity4 's numbers , the affiliates " kind of revolted and said we have to have better ratings , " @entity61 said			2
@entity69 , the chairman of @entity5 's affiliate board , called the decision announced sunday " a great move for the affiliates , the network and , most importantly , the viewers			0
" " we admire their willingness to innovate , and their willingness to change course when it did n't work for us , " @entity69 said in a written statement			0
for @entity5 , which had promised to give @entity4 a full year in the 10 p.m. time slot , " it 's certainly a little bit of egg on the face , " @entity61 said			1
@entity86 analyst @entity85 called the network 's gamble on @entity4 " the biggest fiasco in the history of television			1
" " what they did n't realize was that the people who watched @entity4 in late night were not necessarily the same people who watched in prime time , so there was no reason to believe that his audience would follow him to prime time , " @entity92 said			0
meanwhile , the @entity20 - helmed " tonight " lost about half its audience " and actually really hurt late night , which is a big profit center for @entity5 , " @entity92 said			2
moving " tonight " -- which has held its current slot for decades -- back a half - hour is likely to hurt the show , and @entity92 predicted that @entity5 will be unable to keep all three hosts			1
" my guess is down the road , they will give back @entity4 the ' @entity26 , ' leave it on at 11:35 p.m. , and @entity116 will move to @entity117 , " he said			1
" but if i was either one of those gentlemen , i would be looking elsewhere right now			0
" @entity2 's @entity119 contributed to this report .			0
