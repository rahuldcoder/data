@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity4 video of @entity1 police officers laughing as they publicly flogged a pleading , fleeing woman has sparked outrage , prompting dozens of demonstrators to protest tuesday outside the @entity10 in downtown @entity0 , authorities said			1
the demonstrators belonged to the @entity13 , and 52 of them -- 46 women and six men -- were arrested for unlawful assembly , the @entity11 said in a statement			0
all 52 persons were released under bail , police said			1
the two - minute video has caused an uproar in @entity1 , and columnists in pro-government newspapers have called for an immediate investigation			1
much criticism focuses on how the flogging was carried out			1
the footage shows an unidentified woman in a head scarf and black abaya , or @entity33 robe , and she 's ordered in @entity34 to sit down in a parking lot and take her punishment so that the officers " can go home			1
" the flogging is initially to her back , in keeping with the @entity42 code , or @entity33 law , governing flogging , but when she turns to ask for mercy , the whipping continues to the front part of her body , including her face , hands and legs			1
a shocked passerby can be heard exclaiming , " there is no authority but @entity57 's " after witnessing the woman 's punishment			2
one of the officers responds : " this is a fundamental principle			2
" at another point , an officer laughs when he realizes he is being filmed and asks the person behind the camera to film spectators whom he says are laughing with him			2
that officer then joins the flogging , and the woman is whipped by the two male officers			1
@entity1 's deputy police chief , @entity72 , initially attempted to downplay the incident and told the government 's official news agency that the video was circulated to " damage the image of the country			1
" in a recent meeting organized by the @entity80 and @entity81 , @entity72 said the video was recorded in july 2009 , but was recently released " to coincide with @entity83 in order to bring on more international pressure on the country , " he said			2
on late sunday , @entity1 's @entity87 , which oversees the legal system , announced it had launched an inquiry to see if the punishment had been administered improperly			1
the authority said nothing about the punishment itself			0
the judiciary authority said it would investigate the manner in which the " execution of a punishment went against legally established guidelines according to criminal publications			0
" " the investigation was started immediately after the images of the young woman , being punished under @entity105 and 155 of the 1991 @entity1 penal code , appeared on the internet , " the judiciary said in the statement			1
article 154 deals with the " practice of prostitution , " and @entity111 155 deals with the " management of a place of prostitution			0
" details of the woman 's purported offenses have not been released by authorities			2
local news accounts have reported that the flogging took place in @entity123 , @entity0 's twin city across the river , at the @entity125 , which is in a poor neighborhood notorious for brothels and the illegal sale of the local moonshine " aragi			2
" @entity131 is common in northern @entity1 , where @entity33 law is often enforced arbitrarily under the @entity133			1
police and " public order units " have powers to enforce what is inappropriate dress or behavior			0
local human rights organizations have long accused police of abusing their authority to mistreat women			0

@entity143 was found guilty but was fined rather than whipped			0
her case garnered international attention			0
