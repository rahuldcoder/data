the judge dismissed the juror after ordering the public out of the @entity16 courtroom for a hearing that included defense lawyers , prosecutors , witnesses and the juror			2
the closed - door session was " no broader than necessary to protect @entity3 's right to a fair trial , " @entity5 said			1
after the hearing , @entity5 also said there was " credible evidence " that the dismissed juror had expressed interest in being part of the @entity3 jury and had attended more @entity4 games than the juror admitted on a questionnaire			1
" the juror 's recollection of conversations is not supported by the credible evidence , " the judge said			1
the juror 's presence on the jury " posed a substantial risk " to the fairness of the trial , she added , and the dismissal was necessary in " the best interest of justice			0
