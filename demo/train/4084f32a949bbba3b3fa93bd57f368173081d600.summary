@entity0 -- a racially charged demonstration against the @entity5 government 's handling of immigration from @entity7 turned violent wednesday night as protesters attacked foreign workers , shattered car windows and vandalized a shop owned by a @entity13 migrant			1
@entity15 spokesman @entity14 said 17 men were arrested in the event and brought to a @entity19 court thursday morning			1
they are charged with attacking residents and @entity5 police and damaging property			2
the demonstrators carried signs with the slogans " infiltrators get out of our houses " and " @entity19 -- a refugee camp			2
" they were accompanied by three members of the @entity29 , @entity5 's parliament			1
@entity30 , a @entity29 member from prime minister @entity32 's @entity31 , referred to illegal immigrants as " a cancer in our society " and promised to do anything possible to send them back to their home countries			1
but @entity32 denounced the attacks in a special statement thursday			1
" the problem of infiltrators must be resolved , and we will resolve it , " he said			2
" we will complete the construction of the security fence in several months and soon will start the process of sending the migrants back to their home countries			2
" yet , i would like to stress that the expressions and acts that we have viewed last night are unacceptable , " he continued			0
" we will solve the problem and will do so responsibly			1
" and @entity29 speaker @entity52 criticized the members who took part in the march , saying politicians must help restrain public anger and come up with solutions rather than fan racially - charged flames			1
" we must not be dragged into incitement and the language used by anti-semites against @entity65 people , " @entity52 said			0
the migrants and security problems in the @entity68 has prompted @entity5 to step up construction of a steel fence that will run the 260 - kilometer ( 162 - mile ) border with @entity72			0
an estimated 60,000 @entity7 have crossed illegally into @entity5 thorough its southern border with @entity72 in recent years -- about 700 a week , according to @entity5 police			0
tensions between local residents of @entity19 's working class neighborhoods and illegal @entity7 immigrants have seen new highs this month following a couple of highly publicized cases in which @entity13 migrants were arrested on charges of sexual assault against young @entity5 women			1
@entity86 , a spokeswoman for a hotline for migrant workers , says she ca n't understand the demonstrators ' actions -- " but i certainly understand their hysteria			1
" " objectively , they are right , " @entity86 said			0
" the load on the infrastructures is intolerable , and the city does nothing to improve their condition			0
" but @entity86 blames a government that refuses to legalize their status and allow them to work freely across the country			0
" the only way to prevent these immigrants from coming here is by physically shooting at them as they cross the border , as is done by the @entity72 , " she said			0
" it is clear to me that @entity5 would not do such a thing and therefore nothing would prevent them from continuing to arrive			0
even imprisonment is better than what they experience in their home country			0
