he says his homeland is not tolerant of homosexuals			0
although the order gives @entity2 more time in @entity0 , it does not guarantee he can stay forever			1
it remains in effect until authorities decide whether to reopen his political asylum application			2
@entity2 , 45 , came to the @entity8 in 2002 with a tourist visa from @entity30 , @entity6			1
after his visa expired , he filed for political asylum and received a work permit while his case was being reviewed			1
when his asylum application and subsequent appeals were denied , immigration authorities told him he had to leave on monday			2
" i got a lot of support from the people who love me and want me to stay , " @entity2 said before breaking down into tears			1
" i do not expect anything in return from this country			0
i just want my status to be legal here			0
" in addition to his sexual orientation , @entity2 is ethnic @entity48 and @entity49 , making his return to @entity6 more daunting because he would be a triple minority in the predominantly @entity53 country			1

" i can not come out in my country and have to be hiding who i am			0
" the root issues of @entity58 's case are more complicated than simply deporting someone for an overstayed visa or denying a political asylum application , according to his attorney , @entity62			1
the case sits at the intersection of gay rights and immigration reform , he says			2
" our whole immigration system , 80 % of the cases are based on family unification , it 's about keeping the family together , " @entity62 said			0
" but this just does n't register with the lgbt community			0
it 's a reflection of anti-gay discrimination			0
" @entity2 started dating @entity77 last fall , and they have been inseparable ever since			2
@entity79 , 28 , is an @entity8 citizen			2
