@entity0 -- @entity3 militant groups including the armed wing of @entity5 are committing war crimes when they fire rockets into @entity8 , according to a report by campaign group @entity10			1
@entity3 militants from the @entity12 march during a rally in @entity14 in july			2
three @entity8 have been killed and dozens more seriously injured in @entity3 attacks since november 2008 with rockets striking populated areas up to 40 kilometers ( 25 miles ) inside @entity8 territory and putting 800,000 @entity8 in danger , the report said			1
two @entity3 girls died in @entity14 when a rocket fell short of its intended target while the attacks have also put @entity3 citizens at risk from @entity8 counterstrikes , it added			1
@entity10 urged @entity5 , which controls @entity14 , to hold those responsible for the attacks accountable			1
@entity5 is designated a terrorist organization by the @entity30 and the @entity31			0
@entity5 militants have cut down on rocket strikes in the past few months , but the group has not denounced those targeting @entity8 civilians , nor has it tried those behind the attacks , the @entity33 - based watchdog said			1
" @entity5 rocket attacks targeting @entity8 civilians are unlawful and unjustifiable , and amount to war crimes , " said @entity40 , program director at @entity10			1
" as the governing authority in @entity14 , @entity5 should publicly renounce rocket attacks on @entity8 civilian centers and punish those responsible , including members of its own armed wing			1
" a spokesman for @entity5 , @entity51 , criticized the report , claiming @entity3 had the right to defend themselves against @entity8 military operations			1
" the report is not fair , " he said			0
" it should condemn the ( @entity8 military ) crimes instead of condemning people who defend themselves			0
" the international law gives them the right to defend themselves because they are occupied			0
we have the right to defend our land			0
" during @entity8 's offensive into @entity14 during december and january , @entity5 and @entity68 militants claimed to have fired 820 rockets at @entity8 , the report said			2
@entity10 said the use of homemade @entity72 and @entity74 - designed grad rockets to strike at densely populated areas amounted to indiscriminate attacks on civilians because the weapons can not be aimed with any reliability			0
the watchdog found no evidence that @entity3 armed groups had deliberately used civilians as shields in rocket attacks			2
but it said militants took insufficient precautions to avoid putting civilian lives in danger			0
" @entity5 forces violated the laws of war both by firing rockets deliberately or indiscriminately at @entity8 cities and by launching them from populated areas and endangering @entity98 civilians , " @entity40 said			2
@entity10 has also documented war violations by @entity8 forces during its three - week offensive into @entity14			1
while @entity8 military operations had been more harmful , killing hundreds of civilians with airstrikes , tank shelling and other assaults , " violations by one party to a conflict never justify violations by the other , " it said			0
" attacks targeting civilians are never permitted under the laws of war , which require armed forces to target only military objectives , and to take all feasible precautions to spare civilians from harm , regardless of the reasons for resorting to armed conflict			0
" the @entity122 is investigating violations by both sides and is due to report to the @entity125 in september .			0
