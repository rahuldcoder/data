@entity0 , @entity1 four key leaders converged on @entity1 ' capital wednesday with one official mission : bringing peace to @entity7			1
whether they can achieve that is unsure , considering the violence , bitter divisions and failed negotiations			2
still , the fact that @entity15 president @entity14 , @entity17 chancellor @entity16 , @entity7 president @entity18 and @entity20 president @entity19 made the trip to @entity0 to talk peace is notable			1
not only has war raged for months in eastern @entity7 , where @entity26 rebels angry about political upheaval in @entity28 have declared their independence , but it 's getting worse , threatening not only the lives of more civilians , but the stability of the region			1
speaking at a @entity37 meeting wednesday before his arrival in @entity0 , @entity18 called the summit " the most important one so far i have had as a president , " @entity7 's state - run @entity35 news agency reported			1
the president said he and @entity7 's lawmakers were ready to introduce martial law across the country if " further irresponsible actions " lead to more escalation of the conflict			1
" it will depend on the results of the summit whether we stop the aggressor through diplomatic means or go to a totally different regime , " he is quoted as saying			0
@entity55 showed @entity56 of the self - proclaimed @entity57 and @entity58 of the @entity59 at the talks , speaking with reporters in @entity0 on tuesday night , putting to rest earlier doubts about their attendance			0
monitors from the @entity65 also attended the preliminary meeting			2
that set the stage for the main event involving @entity14 , @entity16 , @entity18 and @entity19 that began wednesday night in @entity1 ' @entity70			1
@entity20 foreign minister @entity71 said that a document would likely be signed thursday , according to the semiofficial @entity20 news agency @entity73			2
but it was unclear what such a document might say			0
will these talks yield a breakthrough ? @entity15 and @entity17 officials sounded a note of caution about the prospects of finding consensus			1
and even if there is some sort of agreement , it 's probably not wise to start celebrating right away -- given that there have been ceasefires before , none of which has lasted			0
the main points of negotiations of the so - called @entity94 -- the leaders of @entity15 , @entity17 , @entity20 and @entity7 -- are expected to be the withdrawal of heavy weapons , the creation of a demilitarized zone and the future status of the @entity102 area in @entity7 , which comprises @entity103 and @entity104			1
@entity17 foreign minister @entity105 said tuesday that the talks were " another huge chance to take a big first step towards de-escalation , hopefully towards a silencing of the weapons			2
" but i underline it again , nothing has been resolved yet			0
the taking place of the summit alone is not a guarantee of its success			0
therefore i urge and expect @entity118 and @entity28 to take it seriously and in the face of imminent military conflict really seize this chance			0
" likely sticking points include who will control @entity7 's border with @entity20 in the disputed territory , disarmament of the separatists and what degree of political autonomy is granted to the @entity104 and @entity103 regions			1
@entity18 has been invited to @entity132 , @entity133 , by @entity135 president @entity134 on thursday to address @entity137 lawmakers and " coordinate future steps , " @entity18 's website said			2
meanwhile , the separatist leaders have been invited to @entity118 , where they will brief @entity20 lawmakers on the outcome of the @entity0 talks			1
the conflict , which broke out in april , soon after @entity20 annexed @entity7 's southeastern @entity145 region , has claimed more than 5,000 lives , many of them civilians			1
there 's been no let - up in the violence ahead of the peace talks ; in fact , both sides appear to have stepped up their efforts to gain territory before the lines of the potential demilitarized zone are drawn			0
four people were killed and nine injured after a central bus station in @entity104 city was hit by shelling wednesday morning , according to the official news agency of the @entity57 , @entity164			0
the @entity162 office website reported that two buses were hit and burst into flames			0
in the past 24 hours , 19 @entity7 soldiers have been killed and 78 injured in the conflict zone in eastern @entity7 , a spokesman for the @entity7 military operation against the separatists , @entity171 , told reporters in @entity28 on wednesday			1
shelling in the town of @entity176 on tuesday killed 12 civilians and injured 35 , including children , with 29 military personnel also injured , according to the @entity28 - backed @entity104 regional authority			0
@entity176 , deep inside @entity7 - held territory , is the location of the main base for the government 's military operation against the separatists , which it calls the anti-terrorist operation , or @entity187			1
@entity7 's @entity188 condemned what it said was " another bloody crime " by the separatists and said @entity20 , which it accuses of sending heavy weapons and troops across the border , should be held responsible			1
the @entity65 said its monitors saw evidence that cluster bombs had been used in @entity176			0
cluster bombs are banned by many states because of their deadly impact on civilians			0
fighting continues around the strategically important town of @entity203 , which has been under siege by separatist forces for weeks			0
@entity7 gen. @entity207 said the town remained under @entity7 control despite a separatist bid to attack the police station there			2
he said there was no fighting in the streets			0
a @entity7 unit also launched an offensive wednesday against the separatists near the city of @entity220 in the southeast			1
each side has accused the other of shelling civilian areas			0
what 's next in the conflict ? @entity229 president @entity228 called @entity19 on tuesday and urged him to seize the opportunity for peace , the @entity227 said			0
" the president emphasized the importance of reaching and implementing a negotiated settlement underpinned by the commitments in the ( prior ) @entity0 agreement			0
however , if @entity20 continues its aggressive actions in @entity7 , including by sending troops , weapons and financing to support the separatists , the costs for @entity20 will rise , " the @entity227 said			1
@entity228 has not ruled out providing weapons to the @entity7 military to help it defend against the separatists ' advances			1
a @entity249 readout of the call said it focused on finding a peaceful settlement of the crisis			0
@entity20 foreign minister @entity71 , speaking alongside his @entity254 counterpart in @entity118 on wednesday , said there was " no military solution to the crisis " in @entity7			1
peace can be achieved only through dialogue between @entity28 and the people of eastern @entity7 , he said , adding : " the rights of all people who live there need to be respected			2
" @entity20 state news agency @entity265 reported that @entity71 would be traveling to @entity0 for the talks			2
the @entity268 's @entity267 agreed on additional sanctions monday against @entity20 and separatist interests but said their implementation would be delayed for a week to " give space for current diplomatic efforts			2
" @entity16 in the middle of a @entity229 - @entity20 standoff the big challenge facing the leaders meeting wednesday in @entity0 is whether they can reach a peace agreement that will stick			1
a previous peace deal was signed in september , also in @entity0			0
it called for a drawback of heavy weapons , self - rule in the eastern regions and a buffer zone along the @entity20 - @entity7 border			1
the new plan envisions a much broader demilitarized zone to run along the current front lines			0
the september agreement quickly disintegrated , and the violence continued			0
@entity20 has steadfastly denied accusations that it is sending forces and weapons into @entity7			1
but top @entity296 and @entity7 leaders have said there is n't any doubt that @entity20 is behind surging violence and separatists ' efforts to take over territory in eastern @entity7			1
all the while , the crisis in @entity7 , which stemmed from a trade agreement , has forced more than 1.5 million people from their homes , according to the @entity308			2
@entity2 's @entity309 reported from @entity0 and @entity310 wrote from @entity311			0
@entity2 's @entity312 , @entity313 , @entity314 , @entity315 , @entity316 , @entity317 , @entity318 , @entity319 , @entity320 and journalist @entity321 in @entity28 , @entity7 , contributed to this report .			2
