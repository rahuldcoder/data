-- when the last surviving soldiers of the @entity2 -- @entity4 @entity3 and @entity6 poilus alike -- died a few years ago , national newspapers in @entity8 and @entity9 , but also in @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 , responded to this transition with numerous articles			2
the reason was obvious : for the @entity6 as for the @entity4 , the former @entity16 , but also for the @entity17 , @entity2 is seen still today as the main historical watershed of the 20th century			0
and it is not by accident that in the political and historical language of these countries this fact is reflected accordingly			0
the war is not so much commemorated as the first of two world wars but as @entity28 , @entity2 , @entity29			1
commemorating the war in @entity31 has always been and still today is much more complicated			1
whatever were the consequences of the war after 1918 , there was another history that came to overshadow the war and made it only the first of two catastrophes			0
in the light of national socialist dictatorship , the @entity43 and the monstrosity of the @entity45 , the war of 1914 became , in the eyes of many @entity31 , a kind of past past , a prelude to the total war which started in september 1939 and which would lead to the final catastrophe of a @entity31 nation state in the @entity53			1
it is against this background that even after 100 years , for many @entity31 the fatal shots in @entity57 mark the beginning of a second @entity59 of unprecedented violence between 1914 and 1945 -- in other words there is a stark tendency to view the @entity2 in relation to 1933 and 1939 , and to see the rise of @entity66 as a consequence of the burden which the war and the following peace treaty of @entity71 brought about			1
the prize of this retrospective logic is a very deterministic view on history : as if the @entity76 had been doomed to failure from its very beginning , and as if there had never been any alternative to dictatorship , mass murder and total war			0
this constellation also explains why in @entity31 discussions , the dimension of the war is reduced to the question of a specific war guilt			1
since one can not possibly deny the responsibility for the outbreak of war in 1939 , the debate on 1914 is all the more intensive -- even 50 years after the so - called @entity95 debate of the 1960s , caused by the @entity98 historian @entity97 who argued that @entity31 political and military elites deliberately caused the war in an attempt to break off the perceived encirclement of the country			1
in a fierce controversy , @entity95 was attacked by many conservative colleagues , many of whom had fought in the war			0
they accused him of confirming , ex-post facto , the allied position after 1918 vis - Ã  - vis @entity31 and of legitimizing the @entity71 treaty 's logic , which had so much poisoned the @entity76 's political culture			0
the amazing success of @entity117 's book " @entity118 " in @entity31 a hundred years after the outbreak of the war underlines just how important the question of war guilt still is in the eyes of many @entity31			1
the book 's argument of shared responsibility , of all international actors and a complex interaction in july 1914 , is translated into some kind of historical exculpation : yes , @entity31 caused the @entity43 , but it is not the main and sole culprit behind the escalation in 1914 -- and hence @entity31 responsibility for what went wrong in the first half of the @entity53 seems to be put in relative terms			0
at the moment one can witness how historical analysis is translated into the politics of history			0
at first sight this is the core of what seems to be the continuation of earlier debates of the 1960s between followers and critics of @entity95			0
but behind this , another debate becomes visible : one about @entity31 's self - positioning in @entity152 and the world			2
because for decades the experience of two world wars and the catastrophe of the @entity31 nation state meant that @entity31 would abstain from a leading political role , including military engagements , corresponding to the country 's economic strength			2
against this background it is hardly surprising that some political commentators argue that now , with the war - guilt of 1914 put away , it is high time to re-formulate a more outspoken @entity152 and world - wide responsibility of @entity31 politics			1
however it seems surprising that all of this is still a very @entity31 perspective on a world war that was so much more than what happened at the @entity177 and the eastern front			2
from a @entity31 perspective it is all too easy to fall into the retrospective logic of history , to view 1914 in the light of 1933 , 1939 and 1945			1
but the first of two world wars was more than a prelude , and it was more than an explosion of violence in @entity152			0
when writing my own book on the @entity2 in @entity197 , many colleagues from the @entity190 , from @entity191 , from @entity192 , @entity193 and from @entity194 were right in asking for a global view on a truly global war			2
compared with this perspective the @entity31 view on the @entity2 is still heavily impregnated by the boundaries of national memory			1

commemorating wwi in @entity31 has always been complicated , @entity213 says
*germans* tend to view @entity2 in relation to 1933 and 1939 , and rise of @entity66 a consequence
in @entity31 , the question of guilt for the war tends to dominate discussion
some argue it 's time for @entity31 to move on and be more outspoken in the world
