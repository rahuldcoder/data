-- @entity1 , the troubled civilian contractor and @entity4 veteran who killed a dozen fellow workers this week at the @entity7 , is far from the only veteran or active - duty serviceman to plan or carry out mayhem directed at @entity12 military targets during the past decade			1
it 's a deadly combination : men who have military backgrounds -- together with personal grievances , political agendas or mental problems -- and who also have easy access to weapons and are trained to use them			1
as a result of @entity1 ' deadly rampage , @entity12 defense secretary @entity24 on wednesday announced a review of access procedures at all @entity12 military facilities and also the procedures for granting security clearances to @entity31 employees , including civilian contractors such as @entity1			1
until @entity1 ' attack monday , maj. @entity34 , a @entity35 , was the most well - known case illustrating the " insider threat " at @entity12 military facilities			1
on november 5 , 2009 , @entity34 , an @entity39 psychiatrist , opened fire on soldiers at @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity44 , killing 13 and wounding many others			0
@entity34 had been communicating via e-mail with the militant @entity48 - @entity12 cleric @entity47 about the permissibility of killing fellow soldiers			0
he had specifically cited the case of sgt. @entity52 , who while he was deployed to @entity53 in 2003 , threw grenades at fellow soldiers , killing two officers and wounding more than a dozen others			2
@entity52 had complained to his father about religious and racial harassment before the attack and had been diagnosed with some kind of mental illness when he was a teenager			0
@entity52 was convicted and sentenced to death			0
the sentence is under appeal			0
more than a year after @entity34 's massacre of his fellow soldiers , @entity39 pvt. @entity66 also plotted to kill servicemen at @entity42			2
@entity66 had applied for a conscientious objector status discharge because of his @entity72 faith and cited @entity34 's 2009 attack as an influence on his own murderous plot			1
@entity66 's plot was foiled in july 2011 after an employee at a local gun store tipped off authorities that @entity66 was behaving suspiciously			2
after the @entity42 attack and a number of reviews examining the lessons learned from it , then - defense secretary @entity80 issued a directive in 2010 ordering the implementation of 47 recommendations to improve " force protection " at military bases in the @entity12			2
these recommendations included giving military personnel better guidance on the behavioral indicators of potentially violent servicemen , establishing a consolidated criminal investigation and law enforcement database for the @entity31 , and re-evaluating background check policies			1
all of these policies might have flagged @entity1 as someone to watch given his long history of run - ins with law enforcement and obvious mental health issues			0
however , the recommendations by @entity80 coming out of the @entity42 shooting specifically did not address policies governing contractors such as @entity1			2
this was a missed opportunity because civilian contractors now number around 900,000 at the @entity31			1
that 's almost double the number of active - duty personnel in the entire @entity39			0
in addition to monday 's attack at the @entity7 , 2013 has seen other deadly incidents involving insiders at @entity12 military facilities			1
in march , @entity119 , a @entity120 sergeant , shot and killed two other @entity120 at the @entity120 base in @entity122 , @entity123 , and then committed suicide			0
the shootings may have been the result of a romantic dispute , according to a senior @entity31 official who spoke on background to the @entity130			1
in july , @entity132 sgt. @entity131 , who worked at the @entity133 in @entity134 , confronted security personnel while holding a handgun and was killed			0
the incident is still under investigation			0
there may not be any one answer to the problem of preventing " insider " attacks targeting the military			0
but there 's hope that the review of base access procedures and security clearances just now ordered by @entity150 will reduce the number of such violent incidents at @entity12 military facilities in the future .			1

@entity156 : the @entity7 shootings not an *isolated* case
there has been a string of cases of veterans and service people attacking military targets
@entity156 says it 's good that @entity31 is reviewing flaws in security
@entity170 : one issue that *slipped* through the cracks was status of contractors
