@entity1 ' @entity0 on friday afternoon stopped any more same - sex marriages in the state , a court spokeswoman said , leaving the legal status of more than 400 gay and lesbian couples who got marriage licenses in limbo			1
this development stems from 21 couples ' legal challenge of @entity13 to the @entity14 , arguing that it violates their federal and state rights of equal protection and privacy			0
@entity20 circuit judge @entity19 ruled in their favor last friday			0
but same - sex marriage was back up in the air after the state @entity0 said wednesday it could n't decide whether to grant an emergency stay because @entity19 's decision was " not final			1
" the county judge updated his order thursday , adding that his decision allowing same - sex marriage took effect immediately			1
@entity20 , at least , was issuing marriage licenses to same - sex couples by thursday afternoon			1
@entity0 spokeswoman @entity34 told @entity35 that more than 400 same - sex couples got marriage licenses in the state since last week 's original ruling			1
she said friday that the legal status of any of these marriages is unclear			2
@entity35 first learned of the state @entity0 's issuance of an emergency stay -- which is in effect while its judges consider the appeal of @entity19 's ruling in full -- via @entity49			0
the @entity1 case is an entirely in - state matter , involving a local county court and the state 's @entity0			2
but it 's similar to a spate of federal rulings in recent months that have struck down other states ' bans on same - sex marriage			1
in those cases , @entity61 district judges ruled that the marriage restrictions violate the federal constitution 's equal protection guarantee			0
but none of these decisions are in effect now , because either those judges stayed their rulings pending appeals or appellate courts did the same			0
there were a few states , including @entity75 and @entity76 , in which same - sex couples married before higher courts stepped in to issue emergency stays			2
that 's what happened in @entity1			0
@entity82 , a constitutional law professor at the @entity83 , said friday that he expects more challenges in state courts to same - sex marriage prohibitions			2
still , @entity82 thinks advocates are more likely to take their fight to federal court			0
" plaintiffs have preferred to sue in federal courts in the apparent belief that they are a more favorable venue , or that federal judges will view their rights more broadly , " said @entity82			0
same - sex couples marry in @entity75 before court halts licenses appeals court scrutinizes @entity100 same - sex marriage ban			1

a state judge in @entity1 earlier struck down same - sex marriage ban
@entity104 grants a stay , thus *preventing* more such marriages
status of couples who got marriage licenses is unclear
