-- maj. gen. @entity1 of the @entity2 announced to the assembled crowd at @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6 , " in accordance with a proclamation from the executive of the @entity11 , all slaves are free			2
" it was june 19 , 1865			0
never mind that president @entity14 's @entity13 had been written and read more than two years earlier			0
@entity15 , named for the june 19 declaration , started as a celebration of emancipation day in @entity6 and eventually spread to other states			0
with celebrations dating back to 1866 , @entity15 now commemorates the end of slavery in the @entity11			0
" @entity11 can not understand its own history unless the @entity30 - @entity29 experience is embraced as a central factor in shaping who we are and what we have become as @entity11 , " writes @entity23 , founding director of the @entity24 and @entity25 in @entity26			1
by the numbers : @entity15 set to open in 2015 , the museum will be the only national museum devoted exclusively to the documentation of @entity30 - @entity29 life , art and culture			1
in honor of @entity15 , the museum helped @entity0 choose six destinations that will enlighten and educate visitors about a complicated period of @entity29 history , the road to emancipation			1
the @entity51 started " @entity54 " tours of this protected area in 2011 , taking visitors on a rugged full - day tour via motorized vehicles on a single - track dirt road to sites related to @entity30 - @entity29 life on @entity49			1
the former plantation on the island belonged to @entity63 , who by the 1850s had some 400 enslaved people tending his land and working in his house			2
the final tour stop is the settlement at the north end of the island built by freed individuals from the @entity63 plantation whose descendants remained on the island through the 1960s			2
in the region : @entity78 , the first @entity79 , has a strong african - american history connection , particularly in the three cabins dating between 1820 and 1840 â € ” built from shells , sand , lime and water to house enslaved people			1
the cabin area is now a historic preservation and archaeological dig site			0
rare life photos document segregation in the @entity92 @entity93 , @entity94			0
@entity95 , a birthplace of @entity29 independence , was also a city of slave - holders			1
the 1780 census reported that 6 % of @entity94 's population was enslaved and most of them were living and working in @entity95			2
although laws abolishing slavery were passed in @entity94 that year , their enactment was so gradual that some people were not freed for another 40 years			2
@entity106 , the 18th - century home of the @entity109 family , immerses visitors in this part of @entity11 's past in the @entity95 area of @entity93			0
its unusual two - story slave dwelling has been restored and is open to visitors , as is the main house			0
@entity106 also holds a large archive of @entity109 family documents that includes household inventories of property ( enslaved individuals are among the " items " listed ) and even the measurements of enslaved individuals ' feet for a local shoemaker hired to make their shoes			0
in the area : the unassuming colonial @entity131 was owned by an abolitionist @entity133 family , who made it a " station " on the @entity136 in the 1800s			0
today it 's a stop on the " @entity141 " self - guided driving tours developed by the @entity140			0
in the years immediately following emancipation , @entity143 wanted settlers , and newly freed people in @entity147 wanted a home where they could raise their children in peace and safety			1
it seemed like the perfect match , but when groups from @entity147 relocated to @entity155 , @entity143 , in the 1870s , they were stunned by what they found there			2
" my husband pointed out various smokes coming out of the ground and said , ' that is @entity142			2
' the families lived in dugouts			0
... the scenery was not at all inviting , and i began to cry , " 30 - year - old @entity166 wrote in 1878			0
what those newly freed people made of the place is the focus of the @entity172			1
the town , incorporated in 1877 and named for an escaped slave , never had a huge population , but it is the oldest surviving @entity30 - @entity29 town west of the @entity177			1
park ranger tours take in five historic buildings and cover the well - documented history of the town and its people , including @entity166 and her husband , @entity183			1
the heart of @entity190 culture , this island near @entity187 , @entity185 , is home to the @entity192 , a school , job training facility and a safe haven for freed people as early as 1862 after the @entity197 were occupied and liberated by @entity2 troops			1
the strength , unity and continuity of the community , most of whom trace their heritage directly to @entity206 , has long been an inspiration , so much so that the rev. @entity208 is thought to have drafted his " @entity210 " speech while visiting there			0
wander through the town of @entity214 , visit studios and shops selling the work of local artists and craftspeople , and sample the lowcountry cooking , derived from traditional @entity30 dishes , that has sustained the region for generations			0
" @entity224 looks the way it does because of @entity29 hands , " notes @entity225 , associate director for community and constituent services at the @entity228			1
from the silhouettes of the buildings to the characteristic ornamental ironwork that adorns them , african - americans , both enslaved and free , literally built the city , and their descendants comprise much of @entity224 's population today			1
" these are families who have been there for 300 years , and they 're grounded in the community , " @entity239 says			0
one neighborhood of interest is @entity244 , where you 'll find 1820s houses built by @entity247 and @entity248 , free black men who owned the homes as investment properties			2
look for the ironwork of master blacksmith @entity253 , who learned from master blacksmiths in the early 20th century and carried on @entity224 's ironwork tradition into the 21st century			1
@entity224 is also an excellent place to explore urban @entity190 culture that grew within the communities of enslaved people from west and @entity261 â € ” developing and refining its own language and traditions -- and that is very much alive today			1
westward migration of freed people from the @entity92 eventually led to towns such as @entity271 , chartered in 1908 in rural @entity272			1
town founder col. @entity271 was born enslaved in @entity147 in 1842 and became a military chaplain after the @entity274			2
what drove him was a desire to nurture self - reliance and security among communities of freed people			1
the town flourished until the @entity282 , and by the 1970s , only a few residents remained			0
@entity267 designated it a state historic park in 1976 , preserving and restoring the buildings , including @entity271 's home , @entity289 's barbershop , the @entity290 and the very first branch of the @entity292 .			0

african - americans , both enslaved and free , built the city of @entity224
@entity142 , @entity143 , is oldest surviving @entity29 town west of the @entity177
@entity184 , in @entity185 , was a safe haven for freed people as early as 1862
