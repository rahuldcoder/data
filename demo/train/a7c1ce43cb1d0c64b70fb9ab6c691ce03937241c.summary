-- in april this year , people in @entity2 picked up their newspapers and saw ... nothing			1
front pages across the @entity7 nation were completely black , in a show of solidarity for a journalist that was simply doing his job			1
this week , as world leaders gather to meet their regional counterparts in @entity2 's capital @entity17 for two major summits , attendees should make a similarly firm statement about @entity20			1
the darkened front pages -- a remarkable move in a country where just a few years before , the military government imposed blanket controls on all media -- were in response to the case of @entity29 , a journalist with the independent @entity30 who had been sentenced to one year in jail			2
his " crime " was to investigate corruption in his home town , a story the authorities apparently did not want to see the light of day			0
it was a preposterous ruling against a journalist who was just doing his job , and @entity42 named him a prisoner of conscience -- jailed solely for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression			2
sadly , the move says much about the backslide in free speech in @entity2 , as the authorities re-tighten their grip on media and increasingly target peaceful critics ahead of national elections next year			1
this tightening comes despite @entity2 's supposed transition away from military rule , which began in 2011 , but which is stalling as the government wrestles over how to secure the benefits of greater economic openness while controlling rising expectations of rights and freedoms that come with this			1
unfortunately , its efforts to maintain control have frequently involved resorting to familiar tactics of repression and arrests			0
president @entity71 has promised to clear the country 's jails of prisoners of conscience			0
yet dozens still remain behind bars , while the jailing of land rights activists , journalists and other human rights defenders has actually picked up pace in the past year			0
and this is not just a problem in @entity2 -- governments across @entity7 , of all political persuasions , are closing down space for dissenting voices			1
just look at @entity88 , where the new government -- formed following a military coup in may -- has imposed blanket restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly			1
gatherings of more than five people have been banned , and even eating a sandwich or reading a book in symbolic protest against the government can land you in front of a military court			0
indeed , @entity88 's media operates under the constant watch of " censorship panels , " and the months since the coup have seen a surge in police investigations and prosecutions under the country 's @entity113 © laws , which ban criticism of the royal family			2
authorities in @entity118 , meanwhile , are increasingly making use of the draconian @entity120 to silence peaceful critics , using a colonial - era law that gives the government sweeping powers to silence dissent			2
two people have been convicted of sedition this year , with at least a dozen others currently facing charges			0
scores more have been investigated for " seditious " activities , including opposition leader @entity131 , who was placed under investigation in september			0
in @entity134 , the authorities continue to tightly control the media , and in recent years online activists and bloggers have been thrown into jail on spurious charges -- there are scores of prisoners of conscience languishing in harsh conditions			2
next door in @entity146 , where earlier this year , security forces shot dead protesting garment workers , an alleged draft @entity150 would criminalize and censor online expression critical of the government and its policies			0
finally , even in @entity155 , which has been praised for its growing openness to improving human rights , dozens of individuals have been prosecuted under the country 's blasphemy laws as repression of minority religious groups has intensified -- that is in addition to the cases of scores of peaceful pro-independence activists from the @entity168 and @entity169 regions who remain imprisoned , some for as long as 20 years , some for simply raising a flag			0
@entity7 has come a long way in recent decades in its efforts to improve respect for human rights , a change that has helped unleash some of the region 's economic potential			1
yet the restrictions on free speech sweeping across the region are troubling , and are only likely to discourage much - needed investment from overseas			1
those attending the november summits have an opportunity to reverse this trend			0
but to do so they must start by speaking out for all those in @entity7 whose voices have been silenced -- and demand the release of all prisoners of conscience jailed simply for the peaceful expression of their views .			1

restrictions on free speech sweeping parts of @entity7 are troubling : @entity202
despite supposed *reforms* , @entity2 is cracking down on media , he says
@entity208 an opportunity for leaders to address freedom : @entity202
