-- one of the main suspects in the killings of 49 people in northern @entity5 received orders from the top leaders of the @entity9 cartel , a military official said monday			1
@entity10 hurled a grenade and fired at troops with a rifle as they closed in on him , @entity14			1
after his capture friday outside @entity19 , @entity5 , he disclosed details of the brutal slayings , @entity17 said			0
@entity22 , also known as " @entity23 " ( " @entity24 " ) , is a local leader of the @entity9 drug cartel in @entity26 , @entity27 , the northern @entity5 city where authorities found the decapitated and dismembered bodies abandoned along a highway last week , @entity17 said			1
the grisly discovery on may 13 drew international attention but was met with a muted response from some @entity5 living in the area , where intensifying turf battles between rival cartels have made violence a daily reality			1
authorities announced @entity22 's arrest sunday and presented him to the media monday , detailing his alleged involvement in kidnappings and killings in northern @entity5 , and in the @entity9 ' efforts to expand their reach into @entity46			1
orders for abandoning the 49 mutilated bodies last week came from the highest levels of the @entity9 , @entity17 said , including @entity50 , the group 's top leader			1
@entity22 and an accomplice were ordered to abandon the bodies in the town 's central square , but instead left them on the outskirts , @entity17 said			2
authorities described him as " one of the suspects responsible " for last week 's killings but did not specify how he was involved in the slayings			2
he will be detained for 40 days while authorities build their case against him , prosecutors said			0
the whereabouts of the suspected accomplice , another member of the @entity9 who escaped during a prison uprising in february , were unclear			2
last week , @entity5 's interior minister said the 49 decapitated bodies were the result of a fierce feud over territory and power between the @entity9 and members of the allied @entity77 and @entity78 cartels			1
banners hanging throughout the country , purportedly from the @entity9 , said the notoriously ruthless cartel had nothing to do with the gruesome crime			2
" this was part of a strategy to blame the actions on opposing criminal organizations ... to cause confusion among authorities and in the public opinion , " @entity17 said monday			0
the @entity9 began with deserters from @entity5 special forces , who quickly gained a reputation for ruthless violence as hired assassins for @entity5 's @entity77 cartel			1
the partnership between the two criminal groups ended in 2010			0
now , officials say the @entity77 cartel is allied with the @entity97 , one of the nation 's most powerful drug trafficking groups			0
@entity22 confessed his involvement in other attacks against authorities and members of the @entity77 cartel , @entity17 said , including carrying out kidnappings and executions and transporting bodies to an area where they were buried or burned			1
he also traveled to @entity46 with a group of @entity9 hit men in 2008 , battling over territory with drug gangs there , @entity17 said			0
authorities have not released the identities of the victims of last week 's killings in northern @entity5			0
last week , officials said investigators were seeking dna samples from families of missing people nationwide in their efforts to identify the bodies			0
that will be the only way to identify the victims -- whose killers cut off their heads , hands and feet -- @entity27 state security spokesman @entity134 told reporters			1
more than 47,500 people have died in drug - related violence in @entity5 since december 2006 , when @entity5 president @entity138 announced plans to deploy troops in efforts to combat cartels			2
according to @entity5 's @entity144 , more than 5,300 people have disappeared throughout the country in that same time period , and the bodies of 9,000 dead have not been identified			0
officials fear the total number of missing could be far higher , because many disappearances go unreported			0
@entity152 contributed to this report .			0
