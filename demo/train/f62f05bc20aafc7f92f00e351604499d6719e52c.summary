@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity1 man who spent a year in jail for nonpayment of child support -- despite the fact he has no children -- has been cleared of the debt , his attorney said tuesday			1
@entity12 was ordered to make back payments even after he learned a teenager was n't his son			1
@entity12 , 50 , spent 13 months in jail for being a deadbeat dad before his release last month			0
a judge ordered him jailed in june 2008 for failing to support his " son " -- a child who dna tests proved was not fathered by @entity12			1
last week , @entity24 superior court judge @entity23 signed an order stating , " defendant is no longer responsible for paying any amount of child support			2
" the order permits the state 's @entity30 to close its file on @entity12			0
" we 're satisfied with the result for mr. @entity12 , but still troubled by the state 's monumental lapse of judgment in this case , " attorney @entity33 with the @entity0 - based @entity34 told @entity2 in a written statement			2
@entity12 did not immediately return a call from @entity2 tuesday			0
his story dates back to 1986 , when @entity12 had a relationship with @entity45 , who gave birth to a son			0
according to court documents , @entity48 told @entity12 the child was his , but the two ended their relationship shortly after the child was born			2
the couple never married and never lived together , the documents said			0
when the child turned 2 , @entity48 applied for public support for the child			0
under @entity1 law , the state , can recoup the cost of the assistance from a child 's non-custodial parent			2
for 13 years , @entity12 made payments to the state until learning in 2000 that the boy might not be his			1
a dna test that year confirmed the child was not fathered by @entity12 , court documents said			1
he returned to court and was relieved of any future child support payments , but was ordered to pay more than $ 16,000 he owed the state before the ruling			1
since 2000 , @entity12 paid that debt down to about $ 10,000 , @entity33 said			1
court documents showed he was jailed for six months in 2006 for falling behind on payments during a period of unemployment , but afterward he resumed making payments , continuing to do so even after he lost another job and became homeless in 2008			2
but last year he became unable to make the payments and was jailed			0
the argument for keeping @entity12 liable for the back payments , according to the attorney who represented him in 2000 , was that he signed a consent agreement with the office of child support services			1
the court agreed that @entity12 had to comply with the consent agreement for the period he believed the child was his son , said attorney @entity91			2
but many , including @entity94 @entity93 , did n't think @entity12 's incarceration was fair , given that the child was not his			1
" i knew the gentleman 's plight and did n't know how to help him , " @entity93 told @entity2 last month			0
when the @entity34 visited the jail earlier this year , @entity93 told them about @entity12 's case			1
@entity12 was released from jail last month after @entity23 ruled he was indigent and should not be jailed for failing to make the payments			0
the @entity1 @entity103 , which includes the @entity30 , plans to propose legislation in the next session of the state legislature that would prevent similar situations in the future , said agency spokeswoman @entity109			0
two things still remain to be cleared up for @entity12 , @entity33 said -- lifting the child - support holds on his driver 's license and his income tax			1
it remains unclear whether he will be reimbursed for the $ 6,000 in payments he made since 2000 , she said -- so far , he has not been			0
