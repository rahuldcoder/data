-- opening arguments are scheduled for monday in @entity2 in the first case in which an official of a @entity6 archdiocese has been accused of protecting abusive priests by moving them from parish to parish			1
monsignor @entity10 has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy and endangering the welfare of a child			1
@entity10 served as the vicar of clergy in the @entity17 from 1992 to 2004 , a position in which he was responsible for investigating reports that priests had sexually abused children			1
a grand jury alleged that he knowingly allowed priests accused of abuse to continue in the ministry in roles in which they had access to children , according to the district attorney 's office			1
@entity10 " acted as if his job was to protect the abuser , never the abused , " a january 2011 grand jury report concluded			1
but @entity10 's lawyers argue that the monsignor had informed his superiors -- including cardinal @entity35 , who died in january -- that priests in the archdiocese were assaulting children			1
@entity39 leads open - air @entity40 in @entity41 the @entity10 case has had reverberations across the country , including the october 2011 arrest of bishop @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity48 , on charges that he failed to report suspected child abuse by a priest			1
@entity10 's case has already had some surprises in the weeks leading up to this point			1
the latest came thursday , when a co-defendant , defrocked priest @entity55 , accepted a plea deal and was sentenced to 2 - 1/2 to five years in prison			2
the deal does not require @entity55 to testify against @entity10 , leaving open the question of how it ultimately affects the case			1
" this is a very mysterious plea , " says @entity0 legal analyst @entity62			0
" and it will be interesting to see as the trial rolls on why this plea was really entered , because there 's something going on that we do n't know about at this point in time			0
" in february , the defense had a bombshell of its own			0
@entity10 's attorneys presented a document that seems to show that in 1994 , @entity35 ordered shredded a document prepared by @entity10 that listed the names of suspected abusers			1
in jury selection process , the @entity78 reported @entity80 as saying in open court , " anybody that does n't ' think there is widespread sexual abuse within the @entity6 is living on another planet			1
" the comment prompted calls for @entity80 to recuse herself			0
because of a court - mandated gag order , all parties in the case are prevented from commenting			0
but @entity93 , president of the @entity94 , says @entity80 was inappropriate and incorrect			0
" we do n't have a problem today , " @entity95 said			0
" we had it in the ' 60s and ' 70s and in the first part of the 1980s			0
if [ @entity80 ] goes in there with that mindset , i think she should have recused herself			0
she 's already -- as far as i 'm concerned -- she 's damaged goods			0
" @entity105 has complicated relationship with church victims ' advocates say the @entity6 still has a problem with priest abuse			2
" we have seen no evidence either that the @entity6 has really changed anything , " says @entity112 , president of @entity113			0
" we have seen them change their public relations and their statements , but we still have n't seen one bishop to be fired or publicly punished for enabling or covering up for sexual predator priests			2
" @entity121 hopes this case will give survivors like @entity124 some justice			0
@entity124 , the nephew of deceased cardinal @entity126 of @entity127 , says he was abused by a priest at a @entity2 high school in 1990			2
the priest died in 1999 , and the statute of limitations has run out on @entity124 's ability to sue the @entity2 archdiocese			1
@entity124 did receive a settlement from the @entity17 of @entity135 , @entity136 , where the priest 's order is based , and says he plans to attend @entity10 's trial as often as he can			2
" we are asking for these people who are responsible for destroying our lives to be held accountable for what they did to us , " @entity124 said			2
" we are the ones telling the truth , and i do n't understand why the @entity6 ca n't tell the truth			0
" finding the truth will be the job of a jury that is likely to hear testimony from alleged victims ; a possible taped deposition from @entity35 ; and perhaps from @entity10 himself .			2
