-- police in @entity3 regularly resort to beating anti-government protesters , despite officials ' pledges to stop such practices , a human rights group said sunday			1
a @entity3 government spokesman denied that allegation and others made in the @entity12 report			1
" the allegations are absurd , and unfortunately , we ask for human rights organizations not to rely on unreliable sources , " said government spokesman @entity13			1
@entity12 said interviews revealed at least five instances in the past month in which police severely beat detainees -- some of whom were minors , according to a report issued after representatives from the group finished a five - day visit to the island nation			2
visible injury marks appeared to confirm details of accounts from former detainees interviewed by @entity12 , the organization said			0
treatment of prisoners inside police stations and formal detention facilities has improved , @entity12 said , and @entity3 appears to have made " rapid progress " in eliminating torture inside police stations after a committee last year recommended installing video cameras there			1
but now , according to @entity12 , beating and torture of prisoners is continuing at informal facilities and in secluded outdoor areas , where detainees have been taken for up to two hours before they 're transferred to police stations			1
" @entity3 's leaders need to make clear that they will investigate and punish those responsible for abuses when the cameras are off , " @entity12 said			1
the @entity3 government spokesman said @entity12 's relationship with political activists " is such that they do n't check the legitimacy or facts behind the allegations			1
" @entity0 has not independently confirmed the rights group 's report			0
@entity13 said the government has taken steps to implement recommendations made by an independent commission last year			0
dozens of officers are currently being investigated under a new government system to look into torture allegations , he said			2
sunday 's @entity12 report comes amid growing global scrutiny of the human rights situation in the @entity74 state			1
earlier this month opposition groups in @entity3 and politicians around the world called for officials to cancel a @entity81 race as violent clashes continued between activists and authorities			2
the @entity84 continued as scheduled , but protesters used the international spotlight on the race to call for the release of @entity88 , a detained human rights activist who has been on a hunger strike for more than two months			0
the activist , who was arrested last april for his role in anti-government demonstrations that swept through his country , is protesting his life prison sentence			0
last june , @entity88 and seven other @entity96 opposition activists were found guilty of plotting to overthrow the country 's @entity98 royal family			0
on sunday , @entity3 's information ministry denied that it was force - feeding @entity88 , saying in statement that @entity88 gave consent for doctors to insert a naso - gastric tube for nutrition after his blood sugar dropped			0
demonstrations in @entity3 failed to gain the traction of other @entity110 uprisings after a crackdown by authorities in the island state , backed by troops from nearby @entity115 and the @entity116			0
in november of last year , @entity3 's @entity117 issued a report critical of authorities ' reactions to the protests , which began in february 2011 , spurred by uprisings in @entity123 and @entity124			0
the independent commission , set up by @entity3 's @entity126 , found that between february and april of last year , 35 people were killed in unrest there			0
two senior international advisers to @entity3 's chief of public security told @entity12 they had visited some of the informal facilities identified by the group , but found no evidence of detainees being taken there and mistreated			1
the chief said the government planned to improve police training to stop abuse , according to @entity12			2
earlier this month , the state - run @entity143 published a statement responding to another report by @entity12 that alleged @entity3 had not lived up to its commitments on reform			1
the nation 's @entity148 and @entity150 dismissed the criticism as rash , saying that @entity12 report " had ignored the positive developments in the country and the continuation of the reform process , " and that it was committed to the protection of human rights			2
@entity0 's @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162 contributed to this report .			0
