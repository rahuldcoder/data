-- the most shocking thing about the arrest of a man linked to 79 killings may be that authorities do n't find it shocking			1
at 20 years old , @entity7 is accused of killing rivals , a policeman , a stripper and other innocent bystanders			1
but you wo n't find authorities in the northern economic hub of @entity15 , @entity16 , using any superlatives to describe the alleged killer			1
not the worst they 've ever seen , not the most ruthless , not the youngest or most prolific			2
that 's because @entity15 and its surroundings are an area disputed by rival drug cartels			0
from 2010 to the present , an average of 108 people have been killed each month in the state of @entity27 , according to official statistics			2
@entity15 , the capital , has recorded 223 homicides so far this year			0
@entity7 's arrest , then , merited a press conference , but no celebration as if an alleged serial killer had been brought down			1
" we are witnessing a very severe crisis because of the war between cartels , " one @entity16 official said			1
@entity7 was caught on october 8 , but the arrest was not announced until thursday			1
he was arrested together with a woman , @entity40 , who police said was selling drugs with @entity7			1
the pair was caught with 35 baggies of weed and 22 packets of cocaine , the state 's security secretariat said			0
the young man confessed to 45 killings , security officials said , and has been implicated in 34 other slayings between 2011 and this year			2
fear of reprisals from the warring cartels means that officials keep details to a minimum , not even revealing what gang a suspect belongs to			0
the @entity16 official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , told @entity0 that @entity7 is a member of the @entity66 cartel			1
the @entity66 cartel is fighting with the @entity68 cartel for lucrative smuggling routes to the @entity70			0
the official scoffed at the idea that @entity7 was any more dangerous or deadly than other alleged cartel hit men			1
he described @entity75 simply as the latest member of a large cell of assassins to be caught			0
@entity7 was not necessarily the shooter in all the cases , but was a witness or otherwise involved in the killings , the official said			1
sometimes he was just one of several shooters who aimed at their targets			0
cartel members who were arrested before him fingered him in connection with the 34 killings he did not confess to , the official said			1
and if the thought of a 20 - year - old having a hand in 79 deaths sounds like an exaggeration , authorities released a list of dates and victims ' names			2
among the killings he is accused of : -- a transit officer who pulled him over on march 13			2
-- an exotic dancer who had been kidnapped from a strip club on july 30			0
-- a woman who happened to be accompanying a member of a rival cartel on january 16			0
-- a group of eight rivals who were at a bar on august 13			0
the list goes on and on			0
it is just a small fraction of the number of homicides committed in @entity27 , the official said .			0
