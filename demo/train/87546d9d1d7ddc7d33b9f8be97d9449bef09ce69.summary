-- @entity2 's @entity1 and @entity3 leave @entity2 on their three - week visit to @entity5 and @entity6 this weekend with their baby son @entity7			1
a " hub and spoke " system has been put in place allowing for the new parents to travel to engagements during the day and return to their son in the evening , much like parents the world over who trudge off to work in the morning only to dash home in the evening to catch baby before bedtime			0
granted most parents in the workforce do n't get to enjoy legions of adoring fans waving flags , parading " we love u ! " banners and requesting royal selfies , but perhaps this will give @entity29 and @entity3 a taste of their much - longed - for opportunity to feel " normal			1
" it comes as no surprise that @entity7 is joining the royal roadshow , but it is prince @entity29 's late mother , @entity36 , @entity36 , who is being credited , yet again , with paving the way for her son and grandson			1
pundits promptly took to their columns comparing the cold , unfeeling queen elizabeth -- who left her children behind as she took off on a six - month tour -- to @entity36 who defied convention and broke with tradition by insisting on taking a then nine - month - old prince @entity29 to @entity6 and @entity5 in 1983			1
in order to do a fair comparison , however , surely we must look at the big picture			0
a full 30 years had passed between royal tours , during which time advances in modern aviation made travel much speedier			0
people 's attitudes towards royalty had shifted , and as popular as she was , @entity36 was merely a princess ... not the @entity57			1
@entity6 hysteria may have made prince @entity59 and princess @entity36 's trip @entity60 look like quite the rock star tour , but when the @entity57 and prince @entity64 set off in 1953 , the world was on the cusp of global hysteria			1
in @entity69 alone , all 38,000 residents of the island nation rolled out to get a glimpse of their new queen			0
in the days before @entity75 , social media , 24 - hour tv news -- when most families still gathered around the wireless to hear the day 's events -- theirs was the biggest show in town			0
the royal couple embarked on the six - month tour of the @entity82 just five months after her coronation			1
they were to travel across five continents on the most ambitious royal tour ever undertaken			0
the countries to be visited included @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity6 and @entity5 -- most of which had never seen a reigning @entity2 monarch set foot on its soil			1
over the course of the trip the @entity57 covered 43,618 miles by land , air and sea			2
she was pulled in every direction , and so strenuous was the tour that there were concerns for her health			0
the decision had been made to leave prince @entity59 and his sister @entity112 at home			2
modern child - rearing experts might say the best place for a child is with its parents , but anyone who has flown 23 hours with an infant might beg to differ			0
imagine if you will flying 17 hours to @entity69 on a four - engine prop with two toddlers in tow and not a @entity124 or @entity125 to be seen			0
you 'd have gotten drunk twice and still landed sober			0
relief on landing would be instantly mitigated by marching bands and a slew of dignitaries waiting to greet your fried and frazzled self			0
picture then a five - year - old prince @entity59 face down on the tarmac , kicking his little hands and feet at having to wear long white socks as his three - year - old sister @entity112 , a veritable shade of puce , screams , " i want my pony ! " no doubt the royal spawn would have been much more mild - mannered , but you can see how quickly things could head south in a haze of governors , @entity146 , @entity147 and jet lag ... and that 's only the first leg			2
a thoroughly miserable experience for parents and tots alike			0
on a personal level , it must have been a horrendous decision for the @entity57 to leave her children behind , but it 's not as if they were left in a dickensian workhouse			2
rather , they were left in the loving care of a doting grandmother and a nanny whom they adored			0
jumping ahead 30 years , @entity36 did indeed insist on taking @entity29 on her six - week tour of @entity6 and @entity5			1
while not exactly a short hop , the family did enjoy the benefits of jet propulsion and first class			0
on landing in @entity171 there was not a marching band or honor guard to be seen , simply a few local officials who frankly were more interested in seeing baby @entity29			2
after a brief photo call , @entity29 and his nanny were whisked away to @entity177 , a working sheep and cattle ranch in southern @entity6			1
@entity29 was to stay there throughout the trip , and his parents had made plans to visit nine times			2
@entity29 and @entity3 are taking things a step further next month by only being parted from @entity7 for a couple of nights during their three - week inaugural tour as a family			1
@entity193 as @entity36 was , it is due to the @entity57 's forward thinking that the monarchy has continued to adapt and evolve , and that @entity29 and @entity3 are now able to reap the benefits			1
in hindsight , it is easy to criticize the @entity57 for being a bad mother and abandoning her children , but had she stayed home and abandoned her royal duties , the critics would have screamed even louder			2
nothing happens without the @entity57 's approval			2
yes , @entity36 was permitted to take @entity29 on tour , but you can bet it was as a result of having to leave her own children behind that the @entity57 gave the go - ahead			1
@entity36 should be credited for many of the positive changes within the monarchy , but it is the @entity57 who should be given the credit this time around			1
