-- the on - going reports about child molestation in the @entity3 have led the public and the media to ask what causes someone to be sexually attracted to children			0
scientists use the word pedophilia to refer to the sexual preference for children before puberty ( usually , before age 11 ) , and the word hebephilia , to refer to the sexual preference for children at puberty ( usually , ages 11 to 14 )			2
although there have been claims that child molestation is a result of homosexuality ( or of celibacy ) , there is absolutely no basis in science for either conclusion			0
the scientific evidence instead suggests that pedophilia and hebephilia are caused by atypical brain development occurring near or before birth			1
@entity35 research has found very large differences in brain structure between men who have a sexual preference for children and those who have a sexual preference for adults			1
these differences were detected as regions of low density in brain tissue called white matter			2
white matter is what connects the various parts of the brain , enabling it to function as a whole			0
the white matter that is affected in pedophilia and hebephilia is the white matter that connects the parts of the brain that respond to sexual images			2
( specifically , these regions were the superior occipitofrontal fasciculus and the arcuate fasciculus			0
) there does not exist any evidence that gay men share this feature of decreased white matter			1
in fact , there is some evidence that gay men have areas of more white matter than straight men , in at least some parts of the brain ( called the corpus callosum )			1
also demonstrating that gay men have no more of a sexual interest in children than do straight men are studies that have measured sexual responses directly : there exists a test , called a phallometric test , in which a man is shown images of adults and children , both male and female , while he wears a device on his penis to detect even very small changes in blood volume			1
the procedure is routinely used with sexual offenders , and research has repeatedly shown phallometric testing to be one of the most -- if not the single most -- accurate predictor of who is the most likely to commit future sexual offenses			0
when regular gay men and regular straight men ( not offenders ) are tested , gay men respond to images of children in exactly the same way that straight men do : very little			1
out of typical men , approximately two to three percent have a sexual preference for men rather than women , and out of pedophilic / hebephilic men , approximately 20 to 30 percent have a sexual preference for boys rather than girls			2
it is an error , however , to conclude from this that the two to three percent who prefer men are more likely than the others to break out of their preferences to contact a child sexually			2
that is , the offenses against boys are being committed by the 20 to 30 percent of pedophiles who prefer boys , not by the two to three percent of otherwise typical men who prefer men			0
the misconception that gay men pose a disproportionate risk to children comes from a misunderstanding of men 's sexual preferences : pedophilia is the genuine sexual preference for children			1
the evidence suggests that these are innate and immutable characteristics			0
pedophilia / hebephilia is not a temporary state from which those who prefer boys can become typical gay men , nor from which those who prefer girls can become typical straight men			1
nor is there any known route by which someone with a genuine sexual preference for adults can develop a genuine sexual preference for children , either girls or boys			0
although it is reasonable to question why the @entity3 priesthood appears to include so many pedophilic or hebephilic men , there is no scientific evidence that homosexuality is the answer , nor that fostering discrimination against gay men could be a solution			1

there is no scientific evidence to link gay men and child molesters
@entity35 research shows *distinct* differences in brain structure between the two
pedophilia / hebephilia is not a temporary state from which one can become a typical gay man
