@entity0 -- @entity11 's " @entity10 " has been named the greatest movie of all time , knocking long - time favorite @entity9 ' " @entity8 " off the top of a once - in - a - decade survey of critics from around the world			1
@entity11 's thriller , starring @entity13 and @entity14 , came top of @entity17 's poll of 846 film experts more than 50 years after the movie was first released -- to little critical acclaim -- in 1958			1
@entity17 has compiled a list of the 100 greatest films every 10 years ; the results , announced with great fanfare , are awaited with bated breath by cinephiles across the globe			0
but over the decades the composition of the top 10 has remained relatively consistent , with " @entity8 " retaining pole position for half a century			0
this time around , though , @entity9 ' 1941 masterwork slipped to the number two slot , ahead of @entity34 's " @entity33 " ( 1953 ) at number three , @entity37 's " @entity36 " at number four			2
@entity17 's editor @entity39 said the surprise result in the critics ' poll reflected changes in the culture of film criticism , away from " films that strive to be great art , such as ' @entity8 , ' and that use cinema 's entire arsenal of effects to make a grand statement " towards those with " personal meaning to the critic			2
" " @entity10 is the ultimate critics ' film because it is a dreamlike film about people who are not sure who they are but who are busy reconstructing themselves and each other to fit a kind of cinema ideal of the ideal soul mate , " he said in a statement			0
@entity68 's " @entity67 " ( 1927 ) rounded out the top five			1
@entity68 's first @entity70 movie was one of a record three silent films to make it into the top ten , alongside @entity76 's " @entity75 " ( 1929 ) and @entity78 's " @entity77 " ( 1928 )			1
and while the rest of the top ten does include films familiar to more mainstream moviegoers -- @entity83 's " 2001 : a @entity84 " and @entity86 's " @entity85 " -- there is little room in the poll for today 's box office hits			1
@entity70 's big - budget blockbusters , such as " @entity92 , " " @entity93 , " and " @entity94 " do not register in the upper reaches of the poll			0
you 'll find no @entity98 or @entity99 -- the most successful film franchises of all time -- and you 'll have to look beyond the top 20 for a film made beyond the 20th century			0
" 2001 : a @entity84 , " dating from 1968 , is the most modern film in the top 10 ; more recent offerings from @entity106 -- 2000 's " in the @entity110 " -- and @entity111 -- 2001 's " @entity112 " make their debuts lower down the list , at 24 and 28 , respectively			2
women , too , are poorly represented -- just two female filmmakers are included in the top 100 -- @entity116 for " @entity117 , 23 @entity118 " ( at 35 ) and @entity119 for " @entity120 " ( at 78 )			0
filmmakers also got to have their say : a separate poll of 358 directors from all over the world , including @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 , picked " @entity33 " as their top movie , ahead of " @entity8 " and " 2001 : @entity131 " in joint second place			1
" @entity10 " was placed seventh on the directors ' list			0
and there 's hope for the likes of @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 -- @entity11 's " @entity10 " was not considered " great " at the time of its release			2
its gradual rise up the @entity17 poll ( it was first included in 1982 , at number 7 ) parallels an increasing recognition of @entity11 's film - making prowess			1
@entity11 : the man behind the movies @entity11 's classics remade in sticky tape			0
