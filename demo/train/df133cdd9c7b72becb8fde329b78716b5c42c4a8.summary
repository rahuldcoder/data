-- in my 20s , after my doctor performed a laparoscopy to examine my uterus and ovaries , he gave me a videotape of the procedure			1
i dubbed it " @entity10 , " threw a party and screened it for my friends			1
three years ago , when my doctor sent me to have a colonoscopy , the last thing on my mind was seeing footage from the exam			1
at 39 , i was mortified about having a procedure that i associated with older people			1
i did n't even want to talk about it , let alone see it			1
but @entity23 is @entity24 , so i 'm coming clean			1
while drinking two liters of liquid that tastes like dirty sea water to evacuate my bowels does n't rank highly on my list of things to do , neither does dying from colon cancer			1
and having a colonoscopy , although unpleasant and embarrassing , was one of the best things i have ever done for my health			1
of all cancers affecting both men and women , colorectal cancer -- cancer of the colon or rectum -- is the second - leading killer in the @entity42 , according to the @entity43			1
overall , the lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer is 1 in 20 , and up to 150,000 new cases a year are reported in the @entity42 , the @entity44 says			1
a recent study published in the @entity48 found that removing precancerous growths spotted during a colonoscopy can cut the risk of dying from colon cancer in half			1
more than 95 % of tumors are detected during a colonoscopy			1
yet despite these statistics , people feel squeamish about the exam and tend to put it off			1
" it 's a potentially embarrassing procedure			1
it 's not like an eye exam in terms of personal exposure , " said dr. @entity61 , the director of gastroenterology and hepatology at the @entity64			1
the @entity44 and the @entity69 recommend that adults be screened for colorectal cancer starting at age 50			1
doctors urge people with a family history of colon cancer to begin screening much earlier			1
i guess i 'm an overachiever			2
while i do n't have a family history of that kind of cancer , i did have one of the common symptoms -- bleeding , a change in bowel habits , weight loss , poor appetite , bloating and / or abdominal pain -- that sent me running to my family doctor			1
he referred me to @entity91 's @entity90 in @entity92 , @entity93 , for a colonoscopy			2
i ca n't describe the pure joy i felt at receiving that news			2
i did n't know too much about the procedure but what i did know sounded horrible			2
during a colonoscopy , a doctor examines the inside of the colon and rectum by inserting a colonoscope , a thin , flexible instrument that sends images to a tv screen or computer			2
in order for the doctor to do a thorough exam , the patient needs to prepare by fasting ; i drank only liquids the day before the exam			2
he or she may also be required to chug down a solution that will ... let 's just say keep them at home , near a bathroom			2
" it literally takes a whole day away from your life , where you could be doing normal things and instead you are drinking this bowel prep that is uncomfortable and that limits your social life , " @entity61 said			2
following the instructions i was given , i started fasting the day before the procedure			2
i was restricted to certain fluids and particular colors of @entity130 ( nothing red or purple			2
) i spent the morning longing for my usual massive cup of coffee and substantial breakfast and instead downed water , @entity138 and chicken broth			2
around 5 p.m. , the fun really started			2
i began drinking a liter of a polyethylene glycol ( @entity143 ) bowel prep			2
i had to down 8 ounces of this stuff every 15 minutes followed by 16 ounces of clear liquid			2
i drank another liter several hours later while trying not to vomit			0
the manufacturers said the solution was lemon - flavored ; it really resembled a noxious mix of chemicals that i can still taste to this day			0
dr. @entity153 , my gastroenterologist , concedes that for most patients , the preparation is the worst part			0
@entity153 and other physicians now use magnesium citrate , which he said requires patients to drink less , is easier to tolerate and works just as well			0
by the time i arrived at the @entity90 the next morning , i was nervous and praying the worst was over			0
i do n't remember anything past the point where i was sedated			0
an iv solution sent me into a " twilight sleep			0
" it also made me forget the procedure , which no doubt was for the best			0
when i woke up , i was groggy but i also felt incredibly well rested			0
i had only a small amount of discomfort , including abdominal cramping that doctors say is normal			0
i do n't remember getting dressed or leaving the hospital			0
but in my daze , i asked my father to swing by @entity176 to pick up a cup of coffee and a sandwich			0
when i got home , i dozed for a few hours and that was that			0
@entity153 called the next day with my results : he 'd found and removed a 1.5 centimeter villous adenoma polyp from my sigmoid colon			0
after examining the polyp , @entity153 estimated that there was a more than a 50 % chance of that polyp becoming malignant			1
@entity153 removed the polyp before that had a chance of happening			0
of all the polyps , villous adenomas are associated with the highest mortality and morbidity rate			0
i consider myself extremely lucky i had a symptom			0
if i had n't , i would n't have had a colonoscopy until i was at least 50 -- and who knows how long i would have put it off after that			1
" @entity202 cancer is one of the few cancers that can actually be prevented , mainly because it goes through this polyp stage before it turns into colon cancer , " @entity153 says			1
given what he 'd found , @entity153 suggested that my younger brother also have a colonoscopy			0
@entity209 had his colonoscopy when he was 36 ; the doctors did n't find anything			0
two important people in my life , my husband 's stepfather and my trainer , have had colon cancer			1
for both of them , the cancer was detected during routine colonoscopies			1
i thank @entity223 they were proactive about their health			0
polyps are slow - growing and asymptomatic , @entity153 says			0
the cancer can also be slow - growing and asymptomatic -- until it starts spreading			1
" usually once you start developing symptoms from colon cancer , things are way too late , " he said			1
eating a high - fat diet , consuming red meat and smoking will increase your risk of developing colorectal cancer , as is a familial history of the disease			1
doctors recommend exercising and eating a diet rich in vegetables , fruit and fiber			0
at @entity246 , researchers are looking into the role that curcumin - a spice commonly used in @entity250 - may play in reducing the risk of colon cancer			1
preclinical and laboratory tests show it may be useful , @entity61 said			0
i 've always loved curry , and i 'm thinking about ways to incorporate this spice into our meals			0
but even if you play by the rules of healthy living , it 's important to get screened			1
" we have to do better , " @entity61 says			0
" family care physicians and everyone who sees patients should ask someone over 50 , ' have you had a colonoscopy ? ' it 's just not a convenient test			1
even physicians tend to procrastinate			0
" after @entity153 called me with the results , i sent a thank you note to my family doctor , telling him how much i appreciated him referring me for a colonoscopy			0
@entity153 's office called me recently to set up another appointment			0
i 'm not looking forward to it , but there 's no question i will do it again			0
considering the alternative , i 'd be crazy not to .			0
