@entity0 -- despite his brushes with the law involving allegations of sexual assault and prostitution , @entity2 insisted in a @entity1 interview that he does n't " have any kind of problem with women			1
" the former head of the @entity13 , once considered a likely candidate for the @entity16 presidency , talked to @entity1 's @entity17 in his first @entity19 - language interview since resigning in 2011 after being charged with sexually assaulting a @entity21 maid			1
all sexual assault charges against @entity2 related to the maid were dismissed at the request of the prosecutor			1
@entity26 asked what @entity2 thought about some who perceive the economist as viewing women as " sexual objects			1
" " no , i do n't actually , " @entity2 replied			1
" i do n't think so			0
i do n't think i have any kind of problem with women			0
i have a problem with understanding what is expected from politicians of highest level			0
it 's different from what [ a ] mr. and @entity43 in the street [ can do ]			1
" @entity26 asked the economist straight out : " what were you thinking that day in @entity21 ? " " firstly , i do n't remember it exactly , " he replied			2
he went on to say , " i was n't thinking anything			0
it happened , something happened , which is a private thing and i still say what happens in a room is a private thing unless the prosecutors find something to tell you that you are going to be charged for something and they have proof of that ... " the maid , @entity61 , told police that she was cleaning when @entity2 emerged nude from a room in his luxury suite at the @entity66 hotel			1
she claimed that he tried to force himself on her , dragged her into the bathroom and tried to pull off her underwear			0
on may 14 , 2011 , the economist , once widely predicted to become @entity16 's @entity71 presidential candidate , was escorted off an @entity74 flight headed to @entity0 and taken to a @entity76 police station for questioning about the alleged sexual assault			1
@entity2 was charged with attempted rape and imprisonment of the hotel employee , denied bail and transferred to @entity21 's @entity83 jail			1
within days , he resigned his $ 500,000 job and was indicted on seven counts -- two counts of a criminal sexual act ; two counts of sexual abuse and once count each of attempted rape , unlawful imprisonment and forcible touching			0
after satisfying a $ 1 million bail and $ 5 million bond , @entity2 got home confinement and had to surrender his travel documents			1
he pleaded not guilty to all charges			0
by the end of the summer , prosecutors had disclosed that the maid admitting lying about certain details , the maid had filed a civil suit against @entity2 and all charges against the @entity105 head had been dismissed			1
@entity2 , often referred to as @entity2 , left the @entity106 for @entity16			1
more than a year later , in december 2012 , @entity2 reached a settlement with the maid , the terms of which were not released			1
@entity26 asked @entity2 why he settled with the maid			1
he explained that he felt he would have to pay more money in legal fees fighting it			0
he opted to " pay and go on with my life , " he said			0
but there have been numerous allegations against @entity2			1
while the case involving the maid was playing out , @entity16 journalist @entity118 filed a complaint against @entity2 alleging attempted rape			1
@entity2 filed a counterclaim against @entity118 for " false declarations			1
" and the following year , in february 2012 , @entity16 police questioned @entity2 about an alleged prostitution ring possibly operated out of luxury hotels			2
in may 2012 , a @entity16 investigation into @entity2 's alleged involvement in a prostitution ring widened , and authorities said police would open a preliminary inquiry into acts that allegedly took place in @entity136 in december 2010 , which they believed could constitute gang rape			1
but in october , a @entity16 prosecutor dropped the investigation connecting @entity2 to the alleged @entity136 incident			2
the testimony on which the investigation was based was withdrawn and the woman declined to press charges			0
@entity2 also told @entity26 that he felt he was treated poorly by police in @entity21			2
" i think it 's a terrible thing , frankly , " he said			2
" the problem is , it 's a moment where in all @entity151 , @entity106 society you 're supposed to be innocent , you 're supposed to be innocent until you 're convicted			2
" @entity2 's arraignment was televised and clips played on @entity106 and international networks			1
" @entity155 walks , " in which defendants -- accompanied by police -- walk in front of photographers handcuffed , are standard fare in @entity106			0
underscoring the cultural differences between @entity16 and the @entity106 , many @entity16 recoiled from images of @entity2 being paraded before the news media in handcuffs and in court -- photographs that would be prohibited under @entity16 law to protect the presumption of innocence			2
@entity2 : a reputation battered by sex allegations so , after all that , would @entity2 still consider running for the presidency of @entity16 ? no , he answered			2
he said that sometimes he gives advice -- and sometimes he does so for free -- to underdeveloped countries			1
@entity2 said he thinks @entity16 's current president , @entity177 , is " doing his best			1
" he spoke at length about the @entity151 economic situation			0
he criticized leaders for not dealing with a downturn when it first developed			0
" what the @entity151 tried to do was to buy time , for political reasons , not to admit the losses so they were unable , " he said			0
" still now they are unable to have a plan for the future			0
they just try to buy another six months and another six months and that 's a catastrophe because the cost today is much higher than the cost -- what would have been the cost two or three years ago			2
" @entity26 asked @entity2 whether he 's frustrated that he 's not part of the discussion to find a solution to the problem			1
" no , it 's my fault , " he replied			0
the economist reflected on work he says he 's done internationally , including some work he says he 's recently done in @entity203			2
" i spent all my life trying to help my people in @entity16 to have a better life , " he said			0
" it appears to me while i was working that i could do this at the global level			0
again , i must be humble			0
" he said of his work in @entity203 : " i 'm doing it totally for free because i want to help them			0
i 'm happy to see the government of @entity203 tell me , ' come to us and help us , we need you			0
' " " that 's much more rewarding than any kind of election in any country			0
people looking at you and say [ ing ] ' we need you			2
