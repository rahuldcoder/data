an emergency contraceptive manufactured in @entity1 will come with a new label in 2014 , warning that the pill may not be effective for women over a certain weight			1
the same may be true for emergency contraceptives in the @entity7			0
@entity10 manufacturer @entity9 was conducting research on another topic related to its emergency contraceptive @entity14 when scientists realized there was " a clear impact of weight " on the drug 's effectiveness , ceo @entity8 said			1
@entity9 scientists discovered @entity14 began losing its effectiveness when women reach about 75 kilograms , or 165 pounds , @entity8 said , and showed an " absence of effectiveness " at about 80 kilograms , or about 176 pounds			1
" we felt it was our ethical duty ... to report those results to our health authorities here in @entity1 , " @entity8 said			0
@entity14 is identical to the emergency contraceptive @entity30 , said @entity31 , a public health expert at @entity33			1
both are @entity35 , or emergency contraceptives that include levonorgestrel , a synthetic version of the hormone progestogen			0
emergency contraceptives are often called the morning - after pill because they work by interfering with ovulation , preventing the fertilization of an egg			2
@entity44 , which manufactures @entity30 , did not respond to @entity46 's request for comment			2
the @entity53 " is currently reviewing the available and related scientific information on this issue , including the publication upon which the @entity14 labeling change was based , " said spokeswoman @entity48			2
" the agency will then determine what , if any , labeling changes to emergency contraceptives are warranted			0
" @entity30 is available in the @entity7 without a prescription to anyone of any age			2
its generic versions @entity63 and my way are also the same as @entity14 , @entity31 said			1
under @entity7 federal law , generic brands can not change their labeling until the name brand product does			0
" @entity73 is approved by the @entity53 as a safe , effective and therapeutically equivalent treatment option to its brand counterpart , " said @entity72 spokesman @entity71			0
" therefore , should any update to the @entity30 labeling take place , we would make the appropriate change to our product as well			2
" @entity1 health authorities approved the @entity14 label change a few weeks ago , but it will take several months to implement in all the countries @entity9 supplies , @entity8 said			2
the new packaging slip will say the emergency contraceptive is " not recommended ... if you weigh ( 165 pounds ) or more , " according to @entity89 , which first reported the story			1
it is unclear why emergency contraceptives may be less effective for overweight women , said @entity95 , an expert in reproductive medicine at the @entity97			1
@entity95 published a study in 2011 that analyzed the risk of pregnancy for women who had taken emergency contraception			1
@entity95 and her colleagues found that obese women had three times the risk of getting pregnant after taking emergency contraception than those with a normal body weight			1
the risk was greater for those who had taken levonorgestrel pills , compared with those who had taken ulipristal acetate , which is used in another emergency contraceptive called @entity116			1
" there has been some evidence over the years that low doses of progestogen - only contraceptives have less efficacy in heavier women , but we do not know why , " @entity95 told @entity46			1
that said , " it is well recognized that body weight affects the way drugs are metabolized			0
" previous research has shown that women who weigh more than 155 pounds are at a higher risk of regular oral contraception failure			2
these drugs take longer to reach normal concentration levels in the blood of obese women compared with normal weight women , according to one study			0
that may be one reason emergency contraceptives are less effective			2
@entity95 noted that the number of obese women in her study was small , so it 's hard to make broad recommendations based on the research			0
in the general population , studies show levonorgestrel emergency contraception prevents about 50 % of expected pregnancies			1
" you are probably better to take @entity35 - @entity152 after unprotected sex than just to leave it to chance even if you are obese , " @entity95 said			0
" when faced with a choice ... i do n't think the findings are strong enough for us to tell women that they should not use @entity35 - @entity152 , " @entity31 agreed			0
" because @entity160 is now available over-the - counter and is by far the easiest @entity152 method to get , this is the method that most women are familiar with			0
" @entity31 recommends overweight women who are worried about the pill 's effectiveness use an emergency contraceptive with ulipristal acetate , or a copper iud			1
iuds , or intrauterine devices , can be inserted by a doctor up to five days after unprotected sex to help prevent pregnancy			0
it 's important to note that women should n't be relying solely on emergency contraception to prevent pregnancy			1
" the best way to reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy among women who are sexually active is to use effective birth control correctly and consistently , " the @entity178 says			0
find the method that works best for you by talking to your doctor .			0
