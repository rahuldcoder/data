-- watching @entity0 's town hall with @entity3 on tuesday , i found the former secretary of state , senator , first lady and potential 2016 presidential candidate thoroughly enjoyable and at times even captivating and compelling			1
i sincerely appreciated the passion and clarity with which she addressed topics such as gun control ( " a minority of people hold a viewpoint that terrorizes the majority of people " ) , marriage equality ( " i 'm very , very proud to state that i 'm a full supporter of marriage equality right now " ) and voting rights ( " i deplore the efforts by some to restrict the right to vote " )			0
and she was downright funny when she joked that she had n't smoked pot yet and was n't about to start anytime soon			0
but otherwise , as in most of her time in the public eye in general , @entity25 was predictable and plain and , i 'm sorry to say , kind of boring			2
her answer on what to do about the millions of families who continue to be ripped apart by deportation was noncommittal			0
@entity25 said that if @entity32 still continues to fail to pass comprehensive immigration reform , she would support " more leeway and more discretion for the executive branch			2
" but @entity32 is n't passing reform any time soon , so real leadership on this issue now requires a more concrete -- and bold -- response			0
and then @entity25 went on to mirror @entity42 talking points about border security and the need to " send a clear " message to would - be migrants , including children who " should be sent back			1
" @entity25 was carefully trying to echo immigrant - rights sentiments while toeing a conservative line on policy -- the opposite of bold leadership			2
when the question of @entity54 came up , @entity25 carefully defended herself to such an extent that she almost seemed to be reading a script			2
what she did n't do was use the opportunity to go after those who continue to politicize @entity54 to try to damage her potential candidacy			0
in fact , she even gave their ongoing concerns credence in suggesting she still has questions about what happened that night -- this despite dozens of hearings and briefings and millions of taxpayer dollars wasted in political fishing expeditions			0
again , @entity25 walked the safe and predictable line here but definitely not one interesting to voters looking for decisive closure on @entity54 , or for those of us in the chattering class			1
i confess i already have a chip on my shoulder about the prospect of a @entity3 presidency			2
she is far too centrist on economic issues and hawkish on foreign policy , not only for my personal taste but arguably for the majority of @entity93 voters today			0
at a time when most @entity93 still want @entity95 held accountable for crashing our economy , president @entity3 would likely be cozier with big banks than @entity99 has been			1
and at a time when the majority of @entity93 are strongly regretful about the @entity102 -- and are deeply wary of another one -- it 's worth remembering that @entity25 voted for the war , even if she did later change her mind			1
even as tea party - ish @entity42 are thumping the drums of economic populism , @entity25 is literally and figuratively the candidate of the establishment			1
of course i think @entity25 would be better for @entity93 than any number of @entity42 alternatives			2
i 'll take pro-corporate , mushy centrism over pro-corporate , right - wing extremism any day			0
but that does n't mean i 'm excited			0
when it comes to economic and social policy , @entity25 is no passionate , populist progressive			2
fine , so at the very least i 'd like to be wowed by rhetoric			0
that 's what @entity99 did			1
i did n't like his centrist record and policy agenda either , but i 'll admit i was dazzled by the way he wrapped his mushy @entity127 status quo - ness in lofty ideals and imagery			0
for us progressives , national elections generally require settling for the lesser of two evils			0
at least @entity99 made us rhetorically feel we were voting for something different			0
we hoped for change , even if we deep down knew we would n't get it			0
in what was presumably a dig at @entity99 , @entity25 said during the @entity0 town hall , " some people can paint a beautiful vision			1
and , thankfully , we can all learn from that , but then , can you -- with the tenacity , the persistence , the getting - knocked - down / getting - back - up resilience -- can you lead us there ? " the implication is that she is no beautiful vision painter , she 's the get - er - done - er -- batting cleanup on the unfinished business of @entity99 and to an extent @entity25 as well			1
and while i genuinely suspect that with her longer exposure to the slings and arrows of right - wing political attacks and both the thicker skin and bare - knuckle tactics she has developed in response , @entity3 might indeed be able to get more done than @entity99 , even when faced with the same utterly unfathomable and childish @entity42 intransigence , i just ca n't get excited			1
but at the end of the day , that lack of excitement may be @entity25 's best asset if she chooses to run			1
after all , we live in a 24/7 scandal cycle where political candidates flame out with one misstep of a tweet			0
( and some would agree with @entity171 that @entity25 has no choice but to be boring , given that " any emotion that @entity3 shows has always been used against her , and it has become a kind of stand - in for the many reasons women are said to be oh - so - unfit to lead			1
" ) opinion : what @entity25 does n't get on immigration the downside to @entity25 being so careful and calculated is also an upside ; she 's not likely to make any serious mistakes anytime soon			1
and while political leaders who make bullheaded ( and factually misleading ) arguments that lead our country to war or those who stand firmly and consistently on the other side are certainly more exciting , we need more leaders who are willing to see both sides of an argument and occasionally admit when they 're wrong -- as @entity25 did on @entity194			2
not exciting but refreshing and important			0
and certainly , given the inability of @entity42 to identify a front - runner at this point , let alone their track record of producing an astonishing rate of disqualifying gaffes , simply by not rocking the boat , @entity25 may sail into the @entity202			1
inevitability is boring , but who cares if it works ? what was exciting about the @entity0 town hall was the format , the superb moderating by @entity209 , the probing questions from the diverse audience , the online interaction via @entity213 and the opportunity for ordinary @entity93 directly to engage a historic figure on live , national television			1
what was n't exciting was @entity25			1
but who needs exciting when you get to be president ?			0

@entity222 : at @entity0 's town hall , @entity3 was cautious and at times compelling
she says the former secretary of state took a centrist stance at odds with growing populism
@entity222 says she does n't find @entity25 's points of view exciting or *inspiring* , as were @entity99 's
@entity222 : being safe might be the price of winning the @entity202 for @entity25
