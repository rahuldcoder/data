if you get arrested in @entity6 , the photos , e-mails and other personal data on your cell phone soon could be a bit safer from prying police eyes soon			1
a bill passed by the state legislature would require law - enforcement officers to obtain a warrant before searching the cell phone of a person placed under arrest			1
if signed by the governor , the bill would override a january ruling by the @entity6 @entity18			1
according to @entity6 sen. @entity26 , who sponsored the legislation , this ruling had " legalized the warrantless search of cell phones during an arrest , regardless of whether the information on the phone is relevant to the arrest or if criminal charges are ever filed			1
" the new @entity6 law unanimously passed in the state assembly			1
gov. @entity30 has until october 9 to sign it into law , according to a spokesman from the governor 's office			2
under this legislation , @entity6 law enforcement officers would have to first obtain a search warrant when there is probable cause to believe a suspect 's portable electronic device contains evidence of a crime			1
the @entity45 of @entity6 , which opposed the bill , argued : " restricting the authority of a peace officer to search an arrestee unduly restricts their ability to apply the law , fight crime , discover evidence valuable to an investigation and protect the citizens of @entity6			1
" the @entity6 legislature disagreed , finding that " once in the exclusive control of the police , cellular telephones do not ordinarily pose a threat to officer safety			2
" furthermore , lawmakers found that existing practices -- including confiscating the phone ( without searching it ) or promptly applying to a judge for a search warrant -- alleviate concerns about destruction of evidence			2
this is n't just about cell phones			0
the wording of this law specifically refers to " portable electronic devices , " defined as : " any portable device that is capable of creating , receiving , accessing , or storing electronic data or communications			0
" so in addition to cell phones this might conceivably cover tablet computers , laptops , netbooks , e-readers , media players , gaming devices , digital cameras , audio recorders , external hard drives , flash drives and other devices available now or in the future			0
the new law can strengthen the rights to freedom of speech and assembly in @entity6			2
the prior court ruling -- though aimed mainly at gathering evidence about criminal activity such as drug deals or prostitution -- also could be used by police to gain intelligence about the identities or activities of people at protests or other public or private gatherings			0
@entity111 , staff attorney for the @entity112 , explained why law - abiding citizens should worry about warrantless cell phone searches			1
" it 's really easy to pick on people who have been arrested and charged with crimes			0
but that subset could get expanded to cover everyone			0
also , an arrest is not the same as a conviction			0
" the new law also strengthens @entity6 's protections for journalists and their sources , according to the @entity125			1
the state 's " shield law , " which prohibits the state or other litigants from subpoenaing reporters ' unpublished notes or other sensitive information related to their work			2
many reporters keep such information on their cell phones and other devices , and it 's not unheard of for journalists to get arrested in @entity6			1
@entity111 noted that once police do obtain a warrant to search an arrestee 's phone or other portable electronic device , it 's possible that everything on that device might become fair game for law enforcement or prosecution			1
" if they have a search warrant , depending on its scope , it might be tough to restrict what information on phones they get and how they use it , " he said			0
" courts are divided on this			0
they recognize that there must be limits to searches -- but they also know that incriminating evidence can be anywhere , and it 's likely to be hidden			0
" in recent months the issue of warrantless cell phone searches has arisen in several states with varying results			2
for instance , the @entity172 barred warrantless cell phone searches , but lower courts in @entity175 and @entity176 have upheld such searches			2
and in may the @entity178 declined to hear the case of @entity180 , which could have disallowed warrantless cell phone searches in that state			1
@entity111 of @entity112 believes that @entity6 's new law sends a strong message to other courts and legislatures around the @entity186 -- including the @entity186 @entity18			1
" i certainly see this issue ending up in the @entity186 @entity18 at some point , " said @entity111			0
" none of the cases involved relied solely on state law			0
they all raised constitutional issues			0
there would be no reason for the @entity18 not to get involved			0

new law would override a january ruling by the @entity6 @entity18
law would require police in that state to obtain a warrant before searching someone 's cell phone
