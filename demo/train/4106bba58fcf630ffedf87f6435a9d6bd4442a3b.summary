-- down on @entity2 , we all know : do anything stupid these days , and video of it will turn up on the @entity6 to embarrass you			1
now , space aliens may be about learn that lesson , too			0
@entity10 deployed live webcams on the @entity12 in march , and @entity14 enthusiasts monitoring their live feeds online have nabbed unidentified flying objects scooting through @entity2 's orbit			1
they 've made screen grabs of the @entity10 video and posted them online			1
@entity21 @entity20 may have been the first , when he plastered them onto his blog , @entity24 , early last week			0
highlighted by a red circle and clearly visible is -- a speck			0
an enlargement of the screen grab reveals -- a blur			0
a note explains the alleged vehicle 's shape : " it has a long line down its middle and a dome on its top , but is rectangle on it lower bottom			2
" if you still do n't recognize it , do n't worry , it 's not called " unidentified " for nothing			0
and it 's hard to know for sure what it is , with all the meteors , satellites and space junk swarming around @entity2			1
a few days later , a similar post turned up of another white speck spied by a space station lens as it pulsates and fades away			0
look down sleuthing for extraterrestrials was not @entity10 's intention when it attached the four high - definition cameras to the space station			1
they offer live views of @entity2 's terrestrial greens and browns , atmospheric and oceanic blues , and cloudy swaths of white as the space station races around the planet once every 90 minutes			1
and they are a high school science project			0
students designed some of the hardware components in the overall system in a project with @entity10 called @entity73 , or @entity74 with @entity10 to create hardware			1
its aim is to figure out how conditions in space , like high radiation , affect video quality to help decide what kind of cameras to use on future missions			2
@entity10 is separately experimenting with using a laser beam to transfer data to @entity2			1
researchers hope it will speed up data transfer by 10 to 100 times			0
the idea is to zap massive amounts of data to scientists , but it could also make for very high - quality video streams			0
aliens on the @entity6 ? the cameras for the @entity2 viewing are consumer grade , off the shelf			1
but they are apparently good enough to snag alien vessels , which may not have journeyed too terribly far to visit @entity2 's orbit , according to @entity24			2
trawling @entity10 images for proof of intergalactic visitors to our solar system has gone on since @entity10 started snapping the images decades ago			2
and the website has page after page of alleged photographic signs of advanced alien life on @entity114 that it claims happened to turn up in pictures shot by @entity10 @entity114 rovers			1
they are replete with fossil remains on the red planet and alien bases constructed there , on asteroids , and even on our moon			0
though the rovers have found that , at one time , @entity114 could have supported basic life , @entity10 has reported nothing on this order			2
at least one alleged alien " mother ship " made it into a @entity10 lunar photo , and you do n't even have to squint to see it			1
though it may seem these advanced beings have accomplished much right in our neighborhood , they have n't learned not to fly within eyeshot of a space station the size of a football field ( including the end zones )			0
or they may just like watching themselves live on the @entity6 .			0

@entity10 recently deployed live webcams on the @entity12
they are there to give people a nice view of the @entity2
@entity14 enthusiasts have used the cameras to spot alleged @entity14
they look like specks and blurs
