-- @entity1 had plenty of stamps in his passport , according to @entity6 intelligence officials			1
he traveled through at least seven @entity8 and central @entity9 countries on his way to @entity11 in 2010			2
it was a meandering journey that might have been a metaphor for a young man in search of a purpose and identity			0
but it 's also clear that by then he had been exposed to a variety of jihadist influences			0
the 23 - year - old @entity6 was shot dead last thursday after being cornered by police in @entity22			1
by then he had murdered seven people in a series of gun attacks			0
as more details emerge about his short and troubled life , @entity6 security services are examining family and local influences on @entity31 , as well as trying to establish who he may have met during that trip to @entity11 and another two - month visit to @entity36 in 2011			1
@entity1 certainly never made any attempt to disguise his travels			2
while in @entity36 in october of last year , he even contacted a @entity6 intelligence official who wanted to interview him about his previous journey , saying he was there to look for a wife			1
" as soon as i get back , i will contact you , " he told his contact , according to @entity43 , the head of @entity44 -- @entity6 's domestic security service			1
after being hospitalized with hepatitis upon his return , @entity1 eventually sat down with @entity6 investigators , bringing a usb drive with photographs of what he said was his touristic journey across the regon			1
but as the standoff unfolded in @entity22 last week , @entity1 told a very different story -- boasting to @entity6 police that he had been trained by @entity58 in @entity59 , the tribal area of @entity36 where many @entity61 jihadists have gone			1
@entity1 said he had been trained by a solo instructor rather than in a camp because he would have stood out as a @entity6 speaker			1
but he also said there were other @entity6 militants in @entity59 , according to @entity43			2
he also claimed that " brothers in @entity36 " had supplied him with funds , helping him buy what he said were 20,000 euros ( about $ 26,600 ) worth of weapons for his attacks			2
@entity6 police believe it is more likely he raised the funds through a series of temporary jobs and petty crime			1
but who , if anyone , trained @entity1 ? was his rambling confession during the siege the invention of a young man with what his attorney calls signs of a " dual personality ? " or did his skill as a gunman suggest training somewhere ? " he 's a @entity89 , two - faced			1
you have to go back to his broken childhood and psychiatric troubles			0
to carry out what he did smacks more of a medical problem and fantasy than a simple jihadist trajectory , " @entity43 told the newspaper , @entity93			0
the @entity98 to @entity99 @entity1 's 2010 odyssey included @entity101 , where his brother @entity102 then lived , as well as @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 and even @entity108 , where according to @entity6 officials he was briefly detained and relieved of a knife by police			1
@entity108 officials have not confirmed he was there			0
@entity6 officials say @entity1 entered @entity11 in the fall of 2010 through its northern border with @entity115 , and traveled south to the @entity117 heartland in @entity99			1
that 's when he first appeared on @entity6 security services ' radar , according to @entity43 , who told @entity93 that @entity1 was detained at a roadblock while traveling with a group of @entity11 in november 2010			1
he was transferred to @entity124 custody and put on a plane back to @entity126 , returning to @entity6 on december 5 , 2010			2
@entity6 officials have not publicly disclosed any evidence that @entity1 developed ties to @entity58 or other terrorist outfits during his two trips			1
nor has any " proof of mission " video yet surfaced featuring @entity1 , though such releases have sometimes taken many months			2
however , @entity135 , the coordinator of the @entity136 on @entity58 and the @entity117 , told @entity0 there were indications that @entity1 appeared to have had contacts with militants in the @entity11 - @entity36 border region			1
and @entity93 cited security sources as saying that he may have been in touch with the @entity144			0
is it possible that in just a few weeks in @entity31 could have become a trained jihadist ? there are precedents			0
@entity149 , an @entity124 citizen of @entity151 descent who goes on trial next month for an @entity58 bomb plot against @entity154 in 2009 , spent only one month in @entity36			2
according to his alleged co-conspirators @entity149 and @entity156 , the trio connected with @entity58 and were trained and directed to launch a plot against the @entity124			0
@entity149 and @entity156 have pleaded guilty to the plot			0
a document found on an alleged @entity162 @entity58 operative in @entity163 last year , which @entity165 authorities believe was written by a senior @entity58 figure , recommended that foreign fighters should be trained quickly and sent back to their home countries to enhance the group 's ability to target the @entity171 regularly , according to @entity172 , a reporter with @entity165 's @entity174 newspaper			2
a family with jihadist connections @entity1 's path to radicalism remains murky but appears to have been influenced by family connections			1
his mother is married to @entity181 , a member of a @entity22 network that tried to recruit fighters to join @entity58 in @entity107			0
@entity181 was convicted in a @entity6 court in 2009 after being detained in @entity104 in 2006 where he was running an @entity58 safe house			2
according to @entity6 security officials , @entity1 tried to visit his stepfather in prison in 2008 and sent him money			1
his brother @entity102 was also suspected of involvement in the same network but not charged			0
he has now been charged with complicity in the recent spate of murders			0
a senior @entity197 counterterrorism official has told @entity0 that @entity198 first came to their notice during a joint investigation in 2008 with @entity6 police into a @entity203 , @entity197 - based jihadist recruitment network			1
the network was sending @entity197 and @entity6 militants to @entity101 en route to join militants in @entity107 -- and may also have connected @entity61 to jihadist groups in the @entity11 - @entity36 border region			1
while living in @entity101 , @entity198 was associated with militants , said the official , but the investigation did not result in charges against him			0
investigators are now looking more closely at the time @entity1 spent with his brother in @entity216			2
it is also possible that @entity1 became radicalized while serving a 21 - month prison sentence for theft in @entity6			1
he told police during the standoff that he had learned the @entity222 while in jail			2
at some point , @entity1 appears to have developed connections with @entity226 , a pro-al @entity227 in @entity6 with a cluster of followers in @entity22			1
the group was outlawed in january 2012 for encouraging @entity6 citizens to travel to @entity11 to fight jihad			1
according to an analysis by the @entity235 for the @entity236 , the group has between 30 and 100 full - fledged members and several thousand online followers			0
following the ban , its leader @entity239 warned " armed struggle is possible " should @entity6 society become more hostile to @entity243			0
a central @entity9 connection ? the only -- unlikely -- claim of responsibility for @entity1 's gun attacks so far has come from a recently - formed central @entity9 terror group -- @entity249 ( @entity250 )			1
" one of the knights of @entity243 , our brother @entity252 ( the @entity6 ) , we ask @entity255 to accept him , went out in an operation that shook the foundations of @entity258 , " according to an online posting from the group translation by the @entity261			0
some counterterrorism officials are skeptical of the claim			0
" it seems highly opportunistic , " said @entity135 , the coordinator of the @entity136 on @entity58 and the @entity117			0
@entity266 , a @entity267 analyst who has researched @entity250 , told @entity0 the group has a track record of quickly and credibly claiming responsibility for attacks in @entity272 since its founding in september 2011			0
" @entity250 has a history of making very relevant and current statements , " typically within 48 hours , @entity266 told @entity0			0
the group , he said , had accurately provided information about attacks , before that information became publicly available			0
while the group is believed responsible for several attacks against security forces in 2011 including the country 's first suicide bombing and gun and grenade attacks , it has yet to launch an attack in @entity272 this year			0
@entity266 said @entity250 's apparent claim of responsibility posted thursday was in similar form to others posted by the group			0
but he cautioned that an attack in @entity6 would be a completely new territory for the group , which had no known track record of attracting @entity300 operatives			0
last fall @entity250 claimed responsibility for several attacks across @entity272 , including a failed bombing in october in @entity303 -- an oil town near the banks of the @entity306			0
@entity266 believes it is possible that a crackdown by security services in @entity272 has driven more of its members to the relative safe haven of the @entity11 - @entity36 border region			1
he says it 's possible that @entity1 encountered jihadists on his journey through central @entity9			1
however , @entity250 was not publicly known when @entity1 was in the region			0
the @entity250 footprint in the @entity11 - @entity36 border region is likely small , @entity266 said			1
" there are reports of no more than 30 of their members being in @entity321 ( the tribal territories of @entity36 ) and it 's possible they 've become integrated with a larger group like the @entity144 ( the @entity144 ) , " he told @entity0			2
the @entity144 , although not directly responsible for terrorist plots against the @entity171 , appears to have forged close ties with @entity58 and the @entity36 @entity117 in recent years , according to @entity300 counterterrorism officials			2
a significant number of @entity165 militants have joined its ranks , including several implicated in an @entity58 plot to attack @entity61 in late 2010			0
as far as is known , @entity1 made no reference to any central asian group during his standoff with authorities .			1
