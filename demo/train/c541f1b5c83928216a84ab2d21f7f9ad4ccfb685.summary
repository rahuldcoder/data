@entity1 centrist candidate @entity0 won the @entity3 's presidential election saturday after campaigning on a " hope and prudence " platform in which he appealed to traditional conservatives and reform - minded voters alike			1
@entity0 spoke of reforms without threatening @entity1 's supreme leader or its institutions , of which he is a product			1
the former national security council chief promised an environment with greater personal freedoms and even indicated he would free political prisoners and jailed journalists			0
in his campaigning , @entity0 also pledged to improve the economy and unemployment , and as a former nuclear negotiator , he said he would reduce the high tension between @entity1 and the outside world by addressing sanctions related to @entity1 's nuclear program			1
@entity26 and old @entity1 continued their celebration of his victory as saturday became the early minutes of sunday			1
they honked horns and flashed victory signs with their fingers			0
in a message through the semiofficial @entity34 , the 65 - year - old @entity0 thanked @entity35 " that once again the sun of rationality and moderation is shining over @entity1 again to send the voice of unity and cohesion of this nation to the world			1
" he cited " all moderates , all reformists , and all principlists			0
" " this victory is the victory of wisdom , moderation , growth and awareness , the victory of commitment and religiosity over extremism and ill tempers , " @entity0 said			1
in a sign of how the @entity58 is interested in how much change @entity0 could bring to @entity1 , the @entity56 immediately called upon @entity0 to set a new course for the country			1
" we call on him to use the opportunity to set @entity1 on a different course for the future : addressing international concerns about @entity1 's nuclear program , taking forward a constructive relationship with the international community , and improving the political and human rights situation for the people of @entity1 , " a @entity56 spokesman said			1
the administration of president @entity77 hopes " the @entity1 government will heed the will of the @entity1 people and make responsible choices that create a better future for all @entity1 , " a @entity75 spokesman said			1
" the @entity85 remains ready to engage the @entity1 government directly in order to reach a diplomatic solution that will fully address the international community 's concerns about @entity1 's nuclear program , " the press secretary 's statement added			1
while the @entity75 respected the vote , it charged that the election occurred " against the backdrop of a lack of transparency , censorship of the media , @entity98 , and text messages , and an intimidating security environment that limited freedom of expression and assembly			0
" @entity105 @entity104 ban ki - moon offered his congratulations and called on @entity1 to take a " constructive role in regional and international affairs			1
" in @entity112 , an opposition coalition in that country 's two - year civil war said it hoped @entity0 would end @entity1 's support of president @entity115 's regime			1
" with its continued support for @entity115 , @entity1 has used all political , military , and economic means to block @entity112 from achieving democracy and freedom , " the @entity116 said in a statement from @entity118 , @entity119			2
" the @entity112 coalition also hopes that @entity1 recognizes the @entity112 people 's plight for free elections , rights and freedoms and that it halts all support to the oppressive @entity115 regime , " the group said			1
opinion : will @entity0 alter @entity1 's policy on @entity112 ? high turnout reported @entity1 officials reported a high turnout , with nearly 73 % of some 50 million registered voters -- men and women , young and old -- turning out , interior minister @entity137 announced saturday			1
the lines extended into the streets at times friday , as voters waited to pick their choice to succeed two - term president @entity146 in the country 's 11th presidential election			2
@entity0 takes @entity146 's mantle as one of the country 's most visible figures , at a time when it is dealing with painful economic sanctions tied to international concern about its nuclear program			1
but he wo n't be @entity1 's most powerful man			1
that distinction belongs to ayatollah @entity160 , who has been @entity1 's supreme leader since 1989			1
he 's got plenty of backing , from conservative citizens to loyalist militia groups to , most notably , the @entity165			0
@entity0 has all - round credentials in @entity1 's institutions that include senior cleric , former commander of @entity1 air defenses and is an intellectual with three law degrees , including from a university in @entity174			1
he has a reputation for shunning extreme positions and bridging differences			0
while he has represented @entity160 on @entity1 's security council since 1989 , he has avoided being perceived as a pushover and has taken exception with the supreme leader on being too rigid toward the international community , according to an @entity1 scholar at @entity184			1
@entity0 has accused state - run media of censorship and publishing lies			1
" i have always deeply believed in the vast and endless capacities of the @entity1 nation for development and greatness , " @entity146 said			2
" i believe that all peaks of glory can be conquered by believing and trusting in the @entity1 nation and by respecting different interests and tastes			2
" on the streets of @entity201 , one celebrating group of two young men and two young women said that if @entity0 does what he promised , they would be " very happy " with him			2
the other candidates were two - term @entity201 mayor @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 and @entity208			0
@entity207 , @entity204 and @entity205 , who is @entity1 's chief nuclear negotiator , are considered close to @entity160 and would have been unlikely to challenge his authority			2
of the three , @entity205 had enjoyed the most popular support going into the vote			0
results showed that @entity0 secured 18.6 million votes -- or 50.7 % of the 36,704,156 votes tallied			2
@entity216 was @entity204 , with 6.1 million votes , and third was @entity205 , with nearly 4.2 million votes			0
moments after @entity0 was declared the winner , supporters started filling the area near @entity201 's @entity223 , waving the campaign 's purple flags , a witness told @entity226			1
motorists honked , and pedestrians held their fingers high with the v sign			0
earlier , @entity232 prime minister @entity231 told @entity226 's @entity233 that the international community " will have to deal with whatever the situation is			2
" " we have to remember this is always only an election between a restricted number of candidates , it 's not democracy as we know it , " he said			0
" we have a very clear message to the @entity1 government , which is that there is an option that gets @entity1 back into the international community , back into the family of nations			2
but it 's got to be proper cooperation on this nuclear dossier , where so little progress frankly has been made			0
otherwise , we will continue with the sanctions			0
" powerful support it was @entity1 's @entity256 , an unelected body made up of six clerics and six lawyers operating under the oversight of the supreme leader , that drew up the restricted list of candidates from the 680 who initially registered			2
eight candidates were approved , two of whom subsequently dropped out			0
the final six contenders did n't include any women			0
nor did they include @entity146 's aide and protege @entity271 , who was among those excluded by the @entity256			0
@entity0 had the backing of the highly influential former president @entity275 and appears to have won over parts of @entity1 's subdued reform movement			1
the 65 - year - old cleric 's campaign began to gather steam last month , when he dared to accuse the state media of censorship and lies during a live interview on state tv , and then criticized the government 's tight grip on security at a televised rally a few days later			0
despite his growing popularity among opposition circles , @entity0 has long been a part of @entity1 's ruling establishment			1
the only cleric among the candidates , he has close ties to @entity160 and served in @entity1 's parliament for two decades			2
he was also @entity1 's lead nuclear negotiator from 2003 to 2005 and holds seats on several powerful decision - making bodies			1
hours into the voting friday , @entity0 complained of a voting irregularity			0
a reform candidate , @entity302 , who dropped out of the race earlier in the week , was still on some ballots			0
@entity0 was worried that voters might mistakenly select @entity302 , which would amount to a vote thrown away			0
it was not clear how many ballot papers were concerned			0
@entity226 's view on the streets of @entity201 @entity226 's @entity312 on 2013 vs. 2009 elections 2009 chaos four years ago , when allegations of election fraud sparked widespread protests , @entity1 's police and the @entity319 , a feared paramilitary group , cracked down on the opposition @entity320			2
protesters were jailed , and human rights groups alleged many were tortured and killed behind bars while the government quashed the uprising			0
reform politicians representing the movement , including @entity146 's election rival , former prime minister @entity330 , have been under house arrest since 2011			0
despite the unrest , @entity146 's re-election was formally certified by the clerical establishment .			0
