-- secretary of defense @entity1 has fired a shot across the bow of business - as - usual at the @entity6 by announcing significant cuts in the @entity8			1
trimming the active component of the @entity8 from 580,000 to 450,000 would hardly take us back to the @entity11 of 280,000 that gave birth to great wartime leaders like @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 or @entity17 , but it still represents a significant reduction in manpower			1
it undoubtedly will start @entity22 on the @entity23 and among other elements of what @entity14 referred to as our " military - industrial complex , " but @entity28 should hold the line as the time is ripe for an audacious move on this front			0
he should stand by these cuts for three reasons : first , if we are serious about trimming federal spending , the @entity36 and the military ca n't be exempt from the budget fight			1
according to @entity41 , only 30 % of the federal budget is made up of discretionary spending , and of that fraction , defense makes up nearly 60 % of what we might possibly trim			2
while modern weapons systems have astronomical price tags , the dirty secret is that one of the biggest lines in the @entity6 's budget is personnel costs -- primarily salaries and health care -- that constitute 26 % of the @entity36 's 2014 request of $ 527 billion			1
given that the @entity8 is the most manpower intensive of our services , it is inevitable that it will have to bear the brunt of these cuts			1
second , after two long and inconclusive wars in @entity64 and @entity65 , it is unlikely that the @entity67 public would rally round the flag for another major exercise in nation - building and counter-insurgency			0
get real , @entity28 tells nation in proposing military cuts the sort of military missions the public is likely to support -- special operations - led counter-terrorism strikes , remote - controlled drone campaigns to mop up @entity79 and indirect military assistance to beleaguered allies -- do not require the hundreds of thousands of boots on the ground that swelled the ranks of the @entity8 over the past decade			1
indeed , for the foreseeable future , the services most likely to constitute the tip of the spear for @entity67 military missions will be the @entity90 and the @entity91 , whose personnel requirements for missions to keep the peace between @entity96 and its neighbors or wage drone and cyber wars are unlikely to be very large			1
finally , the dark cloud of large - scale defense reductions may have a silver lining : bold budget cuts constitute opportunities to subject old and obsolete ways of doing business to the sort of " creative destruction " that economist @entity109 thought was the genius of capitalism			1
although the analogy is by no means perfect , military historians have chronicled instances in which periods of deep budget and manpower cuts have produced great periods of strategic innovation			2
the @entity121 military after @entity122 and the @entity67 military after @entity124 are two examples of organizational adversity leading to strategic quantum leaps			0
gov. @entity128 : cuts to @entity130 a ' slap in the face ' cuts of this depth will undoubtedly force the @entity67 to further trim its military presence overseas			2
@entity64 president @entity136 already showed us the door with his refusal to sign a status of forces agreement covering the small number of residual forces we had hoped to leave in his country			0
@entity65 president @entity146 is turning out to be equally inhospitable			0
but there is significant @entity8 presence in @entity149 and @entity150			2
if we had to choose , we could more safely draw down further on the continent than we could on the @entity152			0
aside from a possible land war in @entity150 , most of our strategic pivot to @entity155 is in response to possible @entity96 naval challenges which do not require much ground power			0
such deep cuts will be painful -- both politically for the administration and directly for our men and women in uniform -- and so should not be implemented cavalierly			0
on the other hand , to paraphrase @entity166 , if we want to make significant cuts , we should " do it energetically and with severity			1
this is the only way to make it shorter , and consequently less inhuman			0
" our military and our country will be better off in the long run			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity177 .			2

secretary of defense @entity1 announced significant cuts to the @entity8
@entity177 : @entity36 , military ca n't be exempt from budget cuts
@entity177 : personnel costs are huge ; @entity8 has most *members* so will bear the brunt
he says drone attacks , special op warfare are the future , not " boots on the ground "
