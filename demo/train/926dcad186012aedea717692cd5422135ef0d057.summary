@entity0 -- within hours of speaking with the @entity2 and @entity3 , both in @entity4 , @entity5 , a leading @entity7 economist , was arrested by the security forces of the @entity9			1
on both these occasions , @entity5 was severely critical of @entity7 president @entity12 's program of substantially cutting governmental subsidies , in what amounts to " the biggest surgery " to the @entity7 economy in 50 years			1
initiated on sunday , the government 's actions introduced a four-fold rise in the price of gasoline and seriously cut government food subsidies , including , literally , people 's daily bread			1
the current 20 % inflation rate , some economies believe , will in fact increase after these new " austerity measures			0
" even economists sympathetic to @entity12 's policies warn of higher inflation and characterize his claim of " zero inflation " as disingenuous			1
a much milder version of a hike in the gasoline price resulted in widespread riots and the burning down of gas stations by protesters back in 2007 , only two years into @entity12 's presidency			1
this time around @entity12 anticipated possible protests by " flooding @entity7 's capital " with the militarized security forces , in a move similar to the government 's response to the opposition @entity48			1
the @entity50 - led and @entity51 - imposed sanctions against @entity7 , aimed at stopping its nuclear program and supported by those wishing for " regime change , " obviously played a major role in increasing the pressure for cutting government spending			2
but among @entity5 's comments to @entity2 and @entity3 was the fact that such cuts in governmental subsidies and a turn to neoliberal economics was a policy favored by the last two presidents of @entity7 , who have also been ( to varied degrees ) supporters of the @entity48 -- @entity68 and @entity69			1
this creates a major rift within the opposition camp of the @entity48			0
its leadership , particularly @entity69 , now needs to decide where they stand -- they can no longer oppose @entity12 for a program they were championing for decades -- but did not have the political will and / or military wherewithal to implement			0
by taking these steps and introducing a form of @entity85 to @entity7 , @entity12 is exposing his own hypocrisy			2
he can no longer pose as the populist champion of the poor fighting against the presumably more affluent members of the @entity48			0
he has also exposed as a fraud his global posturing as an anti-capitalist champion			0
some 7 million @entity7 laborers , and their families -- with their union leaders like @entity96 suffering in the dungeons of the @entity9 -- are set to suffer the consequences of these cuts in subsidies			2
@entity12 's neoliberal economics share another thing with president @entity104 's policies			1
the @entity7 president is pushing an increase in military spending			0
that buildup is first and foremost prompted by the military threat that the @entity50 and its regional allies have posed to the @entity9 for at least the last decade			0
such spending also supports the heavily militarized security apparatus of @entity12 's regime			1
it helps employ less - well - off @entity7 , making them beholden to the regime and enhances the power of the " the military industrial complex " that now rules the country from the headquarters of its paramilitary revolutionary guards			0
be that as it may , these same measures also expose the banality of @entity12 's alliance with such self - proclaimed champions of anti-capitalism as @entity128 of @entity129 and @entity130 of @entity131			1
and it makes a mockery of what passes for " progressive anti-war activists " in the @entity50 who fall head over toe trying to have dinner with @entity12 when he visits @entity0 , in support of his " anti-capitalist , " and " anti-imperialist " positions			0
domestically , the move is a calculated risk for @entity12 , because it will undoubtedly compromise his populist propaganda , if not his claim to a popular base			2
still it may be a risk worth taking for @entity12 , since it could weaken the opposition			2
if this opposition wants a market - driven economy , here it is -- initiated by @entity12 's government			1
the ball is now squarely in @entity157 's court			0
the leader of the @entity48 must clearly and succinctly distinguish his economic philosophy from that of @entity12 and his predecessors , and reach out on behalf of the most vulnerable social classes of the society as they struggle with huge cost increases			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity168 .			0

@entity7 cut government food and fuel subsidies , leading to higher prices
@entity168 : @entity12 is using security apparatus to discourage protests
he says the move shows @entity12 's pose as a populist is not sincere
@entity168 says changes may hurt opposition leaders who have favored cutting the subsidies
