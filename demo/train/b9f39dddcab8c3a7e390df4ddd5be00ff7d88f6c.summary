-- thirty - three @entity2 were released thursday from immigration detention facilities in @entity4 , more than two months after they arrived in the @entity5 lacking proper immigration papers in the aftermath of their country 's devastating earthquake			1
the 33 were among 65 @entity2 detained since entering the country without visas after the january 12 earthquake			1
thirty - two continue to be held			0
many of those freed thursday were released to family members already living in the @entity5 , but they will remain under supervision of federal immigration officials			1
most of those detained came to the @entity5 on military planes , according to @entity23 attorney @entity22			1
@entity24 and her colleagues at the center , along with a team of law students from across the country , started working on the release of the @entity2 in february			0
some of the detainees told @entity24 that after a violent aftershock in @entity2 , @entity5 @entity32 waved them onto a military plane waiting at the @entity36 airport			1
@entity24 said others went to the airport in search of food and aid and ended up in a line to board a plane out of the country			0
at no point did anyone on the ground ask to see the necessary visa documents for the @entity2 to enter the @entity5 legally , @entity24 said			2
a @entity49 official who asked not to be identified did not discount the stories , saying that it was a very chaotic situation after the earthquake			0
but the official added that there were instances where individuals intentionally tried to gain access to the @entity5 illegally			1
while all the @entity2 released thursday still face deportation orders , the @entity5 halted deportation to @entity2 in response to the devastation of the earthquake			2
no timeline has been set for their removal , according to a @entity49 official			0
the advocacy center called the detention of the @entity2 unnecessary without a deportation date and claimed that many of them showed signs of depression , anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder			0
" our clients ' prolonged detention only exacerbated the terrible trauma they had already suffered before fleeing @entity2 , " said @entity76 , center executive director			0
" while we 're obviously thrilled and grateful that this group will finally be able to attempt to recover from their horrific experiences , it 's difficult to understand why they were n't released sooner			0
" after the earthquake , the @entity5 extended " temporary protected status " clearance to @entity2 nationals , but only to those present in the @entity5 before the earthquake			2
" in order to mitigate the probability that @entity2 may attempt to make a potentially deadly journey to the @entity5 , we clearly articulated that those who traveled to the @entity5 illegally after january 12 may be arrested , detained , and placed in removal proceedings , " said @entity91 spokesperson @entity90 .			1
