to date , @entity1 's company has sold over 30 - million pairs of the inexpensive ergonomic sandals			2
@entity1 believes too many companies have switched to importing goods , but it 's not a trend he 's about to start following			0

all the materials @entity22 use are entirely recyclable , @entity1 says			2
" very few shoes , by the way , are recyclable -- the leather shoes one wears for example			0
there are a lot of components going into the shoes so you have to undo them and that process of splitting them up is incredibly time consuming and just not practical			0
our shoes are primarily one material , " he said			2
the company also takes great pains to ensure a zero waste manufacturing process			0
" obviously not everything comes out beautiful and perfect so we end up with scrap or process waste or returns from customers , " said @entity100 , vice president of manufacturing			0
