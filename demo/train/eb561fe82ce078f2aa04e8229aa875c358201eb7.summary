-- this weekend " @entity1 " hit the $ 1 billion mark worldwide			1
but long before the film 's astronomical success , the @entity6 glasses , the action figures and the sponsorship deals , there was the the imagination of one man -- @entity12			1
at 89 , the legendary creator of some of the world 's most profitable comic book characters remains quick - witted , rapturously imaginative and always laughing -- even if , as far as " @entity1 " is concerned , he 's not laughing all the way to the bank			1
@entity12 recently talked to @entity0 's @entity19 in an exclusive interview about the film , which of his characters he 'd like to see next on the big screen , some of his current projects , and why we should n't assume he is now a billionaire			1
@entity19 : even the craziest estimates did n't predict this much success for " @entity1			1
" what is your reaction to creating some of the most profitable characters in entertainment ? @entity12 : oh , i could have told everybody it was going to be this big of a hit ! i do n't know why they could n't have predicted it			1
it could n't miss ! it 's got some of the most popular characters in the world today			1
you put together a great script , a great director , great actors and a cameo by me -- how could it miss ? @entity19 : not including your cameo of course , what 's the film 's ultimate moment for you ? @entity12 : when they all come together and decide to fight as a team			1
i 'm all heart ! years ago , i was writing these characters and i thought it would fun to put them together in a team			2
and i called it " @entity1			1
" and i thought , they have to have some sort of rallying cry			0
so i loved the idea of them shouting -- because i 'm a very corny guy -- " @entity1 assemble ! " @entity19 : obviously with a project of this magnitude , compromises have to be made along the way			1
tell me about one moment in the film you had to bend on			0
@entity12 : it might be hard to believe , but there really was n't a part			1
not only did they omit something i might not have wanted to be in , they included things that i never thought of and were wonderful			0
i thought this movie was as perfect as a movie like this can be			0
@entity19 : when fans see @entity88 characters making record - breaking ( box office ) money like this , they assume it 's made you a billionaire			1
how close is that to the truth ? @entity12 : i hate to admit this , but i do not share in the movie 's profits			1
i just share in the interviews , in the glamour , in the people saying , " wow , i love that movie , @entity12 " -- but i 'm not a participant in the profits			2
@entity19 : but are n't you an executive producer ? @entity12 : yes , but it 's just an honorary title			1
@entity19 : do you you wish you were making more money off of it ? @entity12 : well , it would be nice			2
( laughs ) but i 'm used to the way the situation is			0
i do n't go around thinking about it			2
i am really very pleased that people enjoy the movie , that it 's doing well , and even though i did n't film the movie myself , i seem to be getting a lot of credit for it ! ( laughs ) @entity19 : of all your beloved comic characters , which one would you like to see become a big - screen icon next ? @entity12 : i ca n't wait to see @entity128 and @entity129			1
@entity19 : are those in the works ? @entity12 : i have a feeling they very well might be			2
they 're certainly being considered right now			0
@entity19 : what 's the one character you wish you had created ? @entity12 : well , it would have been nice to come up with @entity139 ! ( laughs ) Ã‚ @entity19 : experiencing highs and lows is part of every life and career			1
at this moment , what do you see as your high and what do you see as your low ? @entity12 : well , i suppose today the success of " @entity1 " is one of the highs			1
and there was a time , many many years ago , when the comic book business went bad and it looked as though @entity88 was going to go out of business			1
we did n't call it @entity88 then			2
it was called " @entity162			0
" i had a publisher that was a great guy , but he did n't like unpleasantness			0
so he would say to me , " @entity12 , i ca n't afford to put the books out anymore for the next few months			1
i 'd like for you to fire the staff while i go to @entity169			0
" it was always my job to fire the staff while he ducked away somewhere			0
that was certainly a low because these were people i worked with			0
i had to let them know there would be no work for the foreseeable future			0
but luckily we were able to build the company back up again and start over again and give these guys work once more			0
@entity19 : poll after poll ranks " @entity186 " as the favorite @entity185			0
do you have another character in the works that will rival his popularity ? @entity12 : here at pow ! @entity195 , with my partner @entity193 , we 're working on quite a number of new movies , television series and even a live action show			1
three of the new superheroes , and i ca n't say too much right now , but the working titles are " @entity202 , " one is called " @entity204 , " and one is called " the @entity206			1
" and each one of them , i say in modesty , is better than the others ! ( laughs ) @entity19 : you ca n't tell me anything about them ? @entity12 : i will say that " @entity204 " is a @entity213 superhero , probably the first one done by an @entity215 studio , and it 's not a @entity213 film			1
it 's a film for the entire world			2
it 's got an angle we 've never seen before and it 's written by @entity223 , one of our top writers			0
" @entity206 " has a different angle and the element of ecology is important in that story			0
but he 's the kind of superhero with a power that nobody has seen			0
" @entity202 " is really two superheroes that are part of the same family , but they become ultimate enemies ! those are just the three movies we have in the works			0
we also have a number of comic books coming that will probably end up as movies or television series or so forth			2
@entity19 : are you talking about " @entity246 " and " @entity247 " ? @entity12 : oh , you are so hip ! " @entity249 " is being published by @entity248			2
two of them are police officers from another planet			0
the other five are fugitives that they were bringing back somewhere and they all land on @entity257 through an accident and they meet me ! we refer to this as the world 's first reality comic book , because it has real people , starting with me			1
but it 's still very much a superhero story			0
also , like " @entity1 , " we also have " @entity267			2
" this is 10 superheroes living in today 's world , faced with the same problems that you and i are faced with , and suddenly something happens that has never happened before in any superhero story			2
i am incredibly proud of this and you 'll be hearing a lot more , because it 's the type of thing when people see it they 'll say , " of course , why did n't i think of that ! " if that does n't whet your appetite , i quit ! @entity19 : there comes a time in all our lives where we select someone to speak on our behalf			2
of all of your characters , who would you have speak on your behalf and what do you imagine them saying ? @entity12 : wow			1
maybe @entity186 , maybe @entity186			0
only because of all of them , i think he has the best sense of humor and he 's the cleverest , probably			0
and what would he say ? @entity302 knows ! ( laughs ) maybe i should n't pick him			0
maybe i should n't pick a guy that smart ! maybe i should pick a guy i could fool a little better			0
but , at first blush , i think @entity186 would be the guy .			0

at 89 , @entity12 is the creator of some of the world 's most profitable comic book characters
