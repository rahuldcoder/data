-- the @entity1 invites eye rolling			1
by definition , all gimmicks are designed to jump the shark , eventually			2
and gimmicks that look like one big selfie orgy may run into backlash faster than most			2
considered another way , however , i side with those who see the @entity1 as a marker of something larger and something special occurring across the culture			1
it 's not the funny videos that matter			2
it 's the power of the peer - to - peer economy , driven by young people , now rippling through the social sector			1
businesses such as @entity23 , @entity24 and " @entity27 " lending firms such as @entity26 have demonstrated the heft of peer models			2
while the @entity1 itself will come and go , peer - to - peer fundraising and activism will stick around			1
@entity33 , an author and expert on nonprofit trends , points to " @entity36 " who are leading the way			0
@entity33 writes that " we are starting to see a rise of crowd funding projects done by and for kids			2
... these are teens ( and pre-teens ) with a passion for social change and who grew up not knowing what it was like to not have a cell phone or be connected to @entity51			2
" with the @entity1 , she explains , " this was not a campaign started by the @entity54 , but young people who wanted to support the cause			1
" the dual forces matter			0
with the arrival of the sharing economy and the generational shift in deciding how to allocate scarce resources -- charitable donations and volunteer time -- donation - dependent and volunteer - dependent organizations must prepare for a new and different future			1
arts researcher @entity67 was the first person i met who figured out how peers influence how we decide which social and cultural events are worth our time and dollar , and which are not			2
indeed , our study from a decade ago showed the importance of peer influence on interest in classical music concerts			1
in more than 11,000 interviews across 15 @entity83 cities , we found 20 % of adults reported attending a classical music concert in the past year			0
yet nearly three times that share -- 56 % -- said they would accept an invitation from a friend or family member to attend a classical music concert			0
what we hinted at then and now see as brutally clear is that it 's all about who 's doing the asking			0
when my sister participates in a fundraising run and sends an email asking me to donate , i do			0
when the professional expert from that same nonprofit organization asks me to donate , i treat the note as spam			0
so the critical innovation of the @entity1 is not the funny visual			1
it 's what comes at the end of the videos , when the soaked participant looks into the camera and challenges family or friends to do the same			0
as the great songwriter @entity115 knew , we all want to be called out by our names			0
when i phoned @entity67 to get his take on the @entity1 , he noted the " social validation " produced through this kind of interchange			1
most charitable giving is private and personal			1
this peer - based alternative creates a lasting good feeling that can only be realized through a kind of social alchemy , not a private act			1
" there is also a generational thing we 're seeing , " @entity67 said , " where young people are moving from relying on an expert critic to relying on a peer			2
i guess this is an extreme manifestation of that			0
i 'm shocked by how many people have thrown buckets of cold water over their head			0
" a hundred years ago , @entity140 was in the midst of building 2,509 libraries around the world -- becoming , almost literally , the bedrock of @entity83 philanthropy			0
his money , his deal			0
today , formal authority has lost some of its value			0
instead of outside experts driving the allocation of volunteer time and charitable donations , " in our world , it 's the power of suggestion , when a friend invites you to something or suggests a piece of music , " @entity67 told me			1
" it 's not just the music coming your way			0
it 's the social imprimatur			0
" because individual donations as a percentage of disposable personal income do not fluctuate much , we may find that the overall level of giving remains steady but that young people seek out charitable causes that provide the best peer - to - peer connections and honor informal influence over traditional authority			1
if so , the @entity1 is causing more than a shock to the system of the person doused			1
it may be sending a shock to the system of traditional fundraising .			1

@entity186 : the @entity1 invites eye rolling , it seems gimmicky
bare : but it may signal a new kind of activism and peer - to - peer fund - raising which will stick around
he says the generation shift and arrival of the sharing economy change nature of charitable giving
bare : the rise of peer influence may send a shock to the system of traditional fund - raising
