-- according to a new survey from the @entity6 , three - quarters of @entity3 adults who own smartphones use those devices to get some kind of real - time location - based information -- from maps and directions all the way to cutting - edge features like @entity17 's @entity16 augmented - reality view			1
that 's up considerably from last year 's figure of 55 %			0
still , mobile location - based services are clearly not for everyone			1
the flip side of these @entity6 numbers means that one in four smartphone - owning @entity3 adults do not use the maps , navigation or other location - related services these devices provide			1
i was surprised by this			0
who would invest in buying a smartphone ( which usually costs considerably more than the simpler " feature phones " still used by more than half of @entity3 adults ) and not at least use the built - in maps and navigation ? this seems to be one of the most basic and universally useful advantages these devices provide			1
it sounds a bit like buying a computer and internet access , but never searching with @entity46			0
but apparently one in four smartphone owners does n't see the need , or does n't know how , to use mobile maps , navigation or location - related services			1
of course , not all smartphones are created equal			0
for instance , according to @entity54 , about 12 % of @entity3 smartphones currently in use are still @entity58 models , many of which have limited or clunky mapping capabilities			2
but that would only explain half the mystery			0
older @entity3 might be another missing piece of this puzzle			2
according to @entity6 , 34 % of @entity3 age 50 - 64 own smartphones , plus 13 % of @entity3 over 65			1
but a little more than one - third of smartphone - owning @entity3 older than 50 do n't use location - based information or services on their phones -- one of the lowest adoption rates for any of the demographics @entity6 examined			1
similarly , @entity6 found that only 66 % of smartphone - owning @entity75 adults use location - based information or services on their phones -- significantly less than whites ( 76 % ) and @entity79 ( 71 % )			1
this is a bit puzzling , since more african - americans ( 44 % ) tend to own smartphones , compared to the @entity3 population at large ( 36 % ) , according to a recent @entity86 report			2
educational attainment also appears to be a factor			0
about one - third of @entity75 smartphone owners whose education went no further than high school do n't use location info or services on their phones			1
also , the less money you earn , the less likely you are to use mobile maps or navigation : only 69 % of smartphone - owning adults earning $ 40,000 per year or less do this , compared to 79 % of those earning $ 75,000 per year or more			1
the fact that your phone always knows where you are enables not just mobile maps and navigation , but also " geosocial " place check - in services such as @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111			1
@entity6 found that 18 % of all @entity3 smartphone owners use geosocial services			1
that 's up from 12 % a year ago -- but it 's still not a hugely popular activity among @entity3 smartphone owners			1
this statistic makes a little more sense to me			0
the perceived " value " of @entity109 and other place check - ins varies widely by user			1
it 's really difficult for a lot of people to see the point of place check - ins			1
for instance , i 've logged more than 1,200 foursquare check - ins , but i could n't care less about how many badges i 've earned there , whether i 'm the " mayor " of anyplace , or who 's on my " leaderboard			1
" in fact , i almost never look at my foursquare account			0
rather , i enjoy taking and posting photos from my phone using services that also let me specify a check - in location , in order to provide context and connection			2
this lets me easily find other people 's photos from those places , and they can easily find mine			0
so i use @entity150 ( and before that was available on @entity152 , @entity153 ) to check in to @entity109 as well as @entity154 and @entity110 when i post a photo			2
this way , i can easily share not just pictures and information but also a sense of place with my friends and others			0
in other words , @entity109 has become a popular but indirect engine for location awareness , which is a far bigger deal ( and more fun ) than its game mechanics			2
@entity6 's numbers on exactly who 's using mobile geosocial services are intriguing			2
women -- who often are assumed to have more security or privacy concerns about revealing their location -- are actually slightly more likely ( 20 % ) to use geosocial services on their phones than men ( 17 % )			0
also , @entity79 ( 23 % ) and african - americans ( 21 % ) were slightly more likely to use these services than whites ( 17 % )			0
wealthier people ( from households earning $ 75,000 per year or more ) are far less likely ( 15 % ) to use mobile geosocial services than people from households earning less than $ 40,000 per year ( 23 % )			0
also , these services are less popular with college graduates ( 16 % ) than with people who hold only a high school diploma or less ( 20 % )			0
for the most part , who 's most likely to use mobile geosocial services is almost the inverse of who 's most likely to use mobile maps and navigation			0
this is odd -- one would think geosocial services and mobile maps and navigation would go hand in hand			0
and in fact , many smartphone owners undoubtedly use both			2
but so far the appeal of these tools and services is far from universal .			0

@entity6 : three - quarters of @entity3 smartphone owners use location - based apps
that 's an *increase* , but leaves *25* % *shying* away from one of mobile 's prime features
older users , those with older phones might not be using maps
higher - income users are less likely to use place - based check - ins like @entity109
