-- the flight down was n't too bad , a little bumpy , but it went up and came down just fine			1
@entity3 peacekeeper force commander general @entity2 when @entity5 called the local office about permission to film , she got an earful of abuse			1
the official wanted nothing to do with us			1
i was n't too worried yet , we 'd made it to @entity16 and we 'd be with @entity3 peacekeepers , @entity18 and for the most part out of the way of government officials			1
the next day the surprises began			1
we were in @entity16 , we were with the @entity3 , but there was almost nothing we could shoot			1
it soon became clear why			2
the @entity3 was in virtual lockdown			1
it turned out that even as we were leaving @entity28 to fly down to @entity16 , rebels were attacking the outskirts of the city			1
in news terms , we were in the wrong place			2
it was immensely frustrating being in the same country as significant breaking news , but unable to get to it			2
we filmed what we could around the base and made the best of a bad situation by doing a few live shots with details about the attack gleaned from our sources			1
my frustration began to dissipate fairly quickly the following day			2
i realized we might have been in the wrong place to see the attack but we were in exactly the right place to see how the @entity49 government controlled the @entity3 peacekeepers			1
for the most part they did n't go out and their force commander general @entity2 was grounded			2
that morning we went to the airport to join @entity2 on a flight			2
when we got there @entity49 officials there said the @entity3 could n't fly even though commercial aircraft were free to come and go as they needed			1
it 's when you stand there face - to - face with the situation and the people responsible that you see who has the power , who calls the shots			2
that was a real eye - opener , but it was still a challenge to get it across on tv			2
we could n't pull the camera out and shoot the whole sequence			2
the story was , the general could n't work , and as the general was our story , if he was n't doing anything we had nothing to shoot -- a sort of @entity81			2
fortunately cameraman @entity82 is an old hand at these situations and we 'd gone in prepared			2
i had my radio microphone , so i could leave @entity82 in the vehicle shooting me while i wandered around outside and he could still pick up what i was saying			2
no one would be any the wiser			0
we sneaked in a few reports at the gates to the airport that way			0
it made us feel better to be getting something in the can			0
the rest of the day was to be even more interesting			0
as we could n't go anywhere , we were able to get more briefs and shoot a few interviews			0
i was starting to learn things that were shocking me			0
not least , that the @entity3 had no power over the @entity49 government , but , for example , some of the female gate guards the @entity3 employed were from the displacement camps			1
fair enough , i thought , until i found out their husbands were away fighting for the rebels			1
the @entity3 was effectively freeing men to keep the war going by supporting their families			1
that night when we got back to our house , i wrote of list of everything shocking i 'd learned that day			0
i would be adding to it for the rest of my stay			0
for example , rebels recruit in aid camps			1
sometimes people in the camps wo n't let the aid workers in			0
and one that really caught me by surprise : the international community had been paying rebels millions of dollars to abide by a 2006 cease - fire agreement			1
many rebels had splintered their groups to get a bigger chunk of the cash			1
admittedly that as over now , but @entity2 saw it as one of the root causes of the increasing lawlessness			0
rebels with a taste for cash turning to banditry when money handouts dried up			1
it was making me realize just how complex the problems in @entity16 are			1
i knew that i was getting far more detail than i could ever hope to fit in to the half - hour program we planned , never mind a short news story			0
but at the same time i felt a huge responsibility			0
we 'd been afforded very rare access			0
the name @entity0 helps open doors			1
we really needed to find out as much as we reasonably and safely could in the time available			0
at times like this our unspoken contract with our audience comes to mind			0
we are their eyes and ears , to open a window on a situation and let them decide what they make of it			0
not prejudice our reports with our own preconceptions of the story and put the camera down when we think we 've got enough to call it a day based on what we thought already , but to be thorough			0
in @entity16 , as elsewhere , we are witnesses to history			1
the innocent victims here have no other voice other than ours			0
only we are able to tell the world what 's happening here			0
when i read that back it sounds a bit pompous , high and mighty , but as our time with the peacekeepers and aid workers was to show , they walk a political and diplomatic tightrope			0
if they speak out about the terrible injustices they see , they risk hampering their operations , hurting supplies and help for the people they are trying to protect			1
in the time we spent with him it 's clear he 's being let down by the international community			1
the politics of his job -- that is , @entity206 's call at the @entity207 to give @entity49 an effective veto over which troops can come -- meant he was never going to get the strongest force the world could supply			0
but then , like him , i was left wondering despite that huge set back why then could n't he get a single one of the 24 helicopters he 'd been promised			0
i ca n't tell you the private conversations we had but they left me feeling a man with very good intentions is having the toughest time of his life			0
i certainly did n't envy him his job .			0
