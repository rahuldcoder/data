where @entity1 needed a big cat , the @entity0 were carried to a stunning comeback by the resilience of @entity6			1
the 37 - year - old , sacked and twice intercepted , refused to give in as the @entity0 -- at one point down by 10 -- fought their way to a 28 - 24 victory over the @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13			1
they were helped by one of the less likely calls in football history , as @entity17 threw a second consecutive @entity19 title into the hands of @entity21			1
@entity0 rookie @entity21 made a game - saving interception when the @entity11 , with the ball on the one - yard line and seconds to play , mysteriously chose to pass after an improbable , juggling miracle - catch by @entity27			1
that moment gave @entity6 and coach @entity29 a fourth @entity19 victory , a feat matched by only two other quarterbacks : @entity33 and @entity34			2
" i just had a vision that i was going to make a big play and it came true , " said @entity21 , 24			1
@entity37 said : " this has been a long journey			0
i 've been at it for 15 years			0
this one came down to the end and this time , we made the plays			0
" our defense , what can you say about them ? @entity21 , what a play			0
for a rookie to make a play like that and win us the @entity19 is unbelievable			0
" ahead of the game , @entity29 had been booed inside @entity12 's @entity55 -- the retractable roof , unusually , left open -- as @entity57 , the voice of @entity60 's @entity59 , sang the pre-game national anthem			1
@entity29 and @entity6 have denied any wrongdoing regarding the lengthy and unresolved ' deflategate ' saga , which concerns underinflated footballs in the afc championship game against @entity66			1
however , @entity6 was evasive on the subject in a pre-game interview aired on sunday , and the jeers as @entity29 appeared on the big screen made the feelings of many clear			2
with that controversy sidelined for the night , the 49th @entity19 's momentum changed as rapidly as @entity75 's halftime hits and outfits			1
the @entity0 had largely outplayed @entity17 before the interval , @entity6 wearing down the @entity11 defense drive by drive			1
@entity6 , in his sixth @entity19 , found @entity81 for the opening touchdown			0
in the process , the @entity0 left @entity17 's famed ' @entity84 on bust			2
@entity17 cornerback @entity86 had already departed the field with an ugly arm injury -- the price he paid for a successful interception -- and , with team - mates @entity91 , @entity93 and @entity94 all carrying injuries , substitute @entity96 became the latest seahawk on the wrong end of a collision as he failed to stop @entity81			2
@entity17 quarterback @entity100 , essentially anonymous to this point , struck back with the night 's first phenomenal pass to 25 - year - old rookie and former shoe salesman @entity104			2
that allowed the @entity107 's quiet man -- @entity108 -- to drive over the line and score			0
@entity0 tight end @entity111 mowed down @entity112 to restore @entity0 's advantage , but that only served to cue up one of the gutsier plays in @entity19 history			1
with seconds remaining in the half , the @entity11 abandoned the safe option of a field goal			0
instead , @entity100 wasted just 1.79 seconds in delivering a bullet pass down the throat of a jubilant @entity104 in the end zone			0
cue @entity1 , who brought an almost overwhelming array of lights , pyrotechnics and songs to a halftime show she dedicated to her younger self			1
arriving on a giant , mechanical lion before graduating to a shimmy with sharks , @entity75 opened with @entity135 before cramming in split - second blasts of @entity137 , @entity131 , @entity138 and -- lastly -- firework , during which she ascended aboard a shooting star			2
guest star @entity142 emerged to an energetic @entity143 , relegating the show 's other name , @entity146 , to the background			1
when play restarted , @entity17 were at the fore			0
having barely seen the ball , that last - gasp score sent the @entity11 into the second half in possession and in control			0
the reigning champions immediately moved up by three , @entity104 again wrapping up a 45 - yard pass play to set up a @entity11 field goal			0
after @entity6 threw his second interception of the night , @entity17 wide receiver @entity158 expertly lost @entity0 's @entity160 by running him into an official -- leaving @entity158 all alone in the end zone , and the @entity164 champions ahead by 10			1
@entity6 had been nowhere near perfect but demonstrated his determination as he shrugged off a poor throw , missing @entity167 , to find @entity168 and get the @entity0 rolling again			1
watched by the likes of @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity172 , the intensity of @entity0 's offense ground down the depleted @entity175 as the final minutes ticked away			2
with two minutes remaining , @entity6 once again tried to find @entity167 in the end zone			2
this time he was successful , and the @entity0 had overcome a 10 - point deficit			1
@entity17 , however , should have had the last laugh			0
having been granted a near - unbelievable slice of good fortune as the falling @entity27 used both knees and a hand to somehow hold on to a pass , the @entity11 made what some observers labelled one of the worst calls in football history			1
on the brink of back - to - back @entity19 victories , @entity17 elected to throw the ball , shunning @entity108 and gifting @entity193 the interception			0
following that staggering climax , the game 's dying moments descended into a mass brawl which led to the ejection of the @entity11 ' @entity200			0
by that point , the fight simply delayed an inevitable @entity0 victory			2
" i ca n't even tell you , i ca n't even feel it , " said @entity11 coach @entity204 of the decision to throw the ball			0
" for it to come down to a play like that , i hate that we have to live with that			0
" @entity0 's @entity167 said : " we made more plays , we executed when we had to , we have a mentally tough team that works their tails off			1
" we are the epitome of what @entity219 is all about			0

@entity21 makes vital interception after @entity6 and @entity0 recover 10 - point deficit
seahawks go ahead with gutsy plays but end game with ' one of worst calls in football history '
@entity1 's halftime show roars with mechanical big cat , *dancing* sharks and @entity142
