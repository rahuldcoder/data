" four years later , it 's the government 's own actions to obtain personal information that are in the spotlight , thanks to new reports from @entity10 and @entity11			1
the goal of @entity3 is to educate people and companies on the vulnerability of personal data , including information shared on social networks , financial data and anything stored on cloud services			1
the holiday is spearheaded by the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) , a nonprofit organization that works with government agencies and major tech companies including @entity26 , @entity10 , @entity27 and @entity28			2
" we want to raise universal awareness about people respecting the privacy of others and safeguarding their data , " said @entity29 , @entity30 's executive director			0
to mark the occasion , @entity11 released its latest transparency report , which breaks down government requests for user data as well as copyright complaints and " take down " requests			1
@entity10 followed up on its own transparency report , released last week , with a blog post explaining how it fields government requests and a new section on its transparency report that addresses common questions about the process			1
the numbers from the two companies show a steady increase in requests from the @entity2 government for personal data			1
usually these requests are part of criminal investigations or court cases , according to the two companies			0
the majority of requests from @entity2 agencies are subpoenas , followed by search warrants , court orders and some emergency requests			2
search warrants are more difficult to obtain than a subpoena and require a higher standard of probable cause			0
in the past six months , @entity10 received 21,389 requests for data , a 70 % increase since the company first started releasing the report in 2010			1
the largest single entity requesting information continued to be the @entity2 government , which submitted 8,438 of the requests			1
@entity10 turned over some or all of the requested information 88 percent of the time , @entity11 57 percent of the time			1
@entity11 received 1,858 requests for information about 1,433 accounts , 815 of which were from the @entity2 government			1

" it 's our continued hope that providing greater insight into this information helps in at least two ways : first , to raise public awareness about these invasive requests ; second , to enable policy makers to make more informed decisions , " @entity11 's legal policy manager @entity93 said in a blog post			2
transparency and education about what the government can access and how are important , but the companies also want to change the laws to better protect user privacy in the first place			0
" we 're a law - abiding company , and we do n't want our services to be used in harmful ways			0
but it 's just as important that laws protect you against overly broad requests for your personal information , " said @entity10 's chief legal officer @entity115 in a blog post on monday			2
under the 1986 @entity122 ( @entity122 ) , a file stored on a hard drive in your home has greater protection than information stored with a third - party			0

@entity11 and @entity10 are both members of the @entity142 , an organization that is lobbying to update the act			2
@entity115 explained @entity10 's process for handling requests , which involves notifying users of the requests when legally allowed , and requiring a search warrant for search query and private information from agencies conducting criminal investigations			0
" we believe a warrant is required by the @entity155 to the @entity156 , which prohibits unreasonable search and seizure and overrides conflicting provisions in @entity122 , " says @entity115			0
these kinds of reports and posts are important tools for educating the public about how and when government agencies can access information , but government requests are only one sliver of data privacy fluency			2
people can also take steps to better control what they share online on social networks or apps that collect location data			0
