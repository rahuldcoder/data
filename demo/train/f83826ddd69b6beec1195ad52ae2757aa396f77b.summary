@entity1 , @entity0 -- so often it starts with just a provocative word , and in my case it was three ... " @entity7 "			0
a phrase more commonly used to describe bruising and pain had been used as the title of an autobiography by @entity13 's first black footballer , @entity12			1
@entity12 endured horrendous abuse in the 1980s as @entity13 's first black footballer			1
i was sold on it even before i 'd opened the front cover , the book 's description hinted at an incredible story of a young footballer who had managed to fulfil his dreams , against all the odds			1
but @entity25 's dream was often a nightmare , he suffered horrendous abuse from both his own team 's supporters , as well as opposition fans , and it took him years to finally become accepted by " his own			2
" this was back in 1982 -- and his experience was n't entirely unique			0
the few players who " looked different " in the 1970s and 80s were regularly subjected to vile abuse from the stands , monkey chanting and the humiliation of being targeted by supporters throwing bananas and other pieces of fruit			0
i 'm fortunately too young to remember seeing any of this stuff at football grounds			2
by the time i started going regularly to games in @entity1 in the late 80s much of this had died down and now it 's very , very rare in the @entity50			2
campaign groups like " @entity52 " have helped eradicate much of it at sporting arenas , where at the very least it is deemed socially unacceptable			0
but @entity25 's story was an eye - opening , jaw - dropping window into the past and i was keen to meet him			1
to sit with @entity12 in the seats at @entity13 's @entity65 ground and re-live his torment was a sobering assignment , but i was impressed with his strength and philosophy			1
he 's taken some hard knocks in his life , drug addiction and cancer to name but two , but he never let the bigots cool his passion for the game			2
tragically , it was a serious knee injury that forced him out of football in 1987			2
the fact that @entity12 is still an active campaigner against racism tells you something though -- there 's still work to be done			1
but whatever problems linger in the @entity50 -- it 's nothing compared to continental @entity87 and beyond			2
using @entity89 as the cornerstone for our investigation , we looked at @entity92 and @entity93 ; two high - profile footballing nations , where it 's said that attempts to tackle racism are 30 years behind the @entity50			1
why is that ? and has there been any serious attempts to deal with it ? is enough being done to tackle racism in sport ? have your say we talked to some of the biggest names in the @entity87 game @entity109 , @entity110 and the @entity112 president @entity111 to get their thoughts			1
of course it 's not just football that suffers , earlier this year @entity117 's first black racing driver @entity116 was on the receiving end of racist abuse while testing in @entity92			1
there was uproar in the @entity50 media , but for some reason the @entity92 press seemed less excited			0
in some top - level , win - at - all - costs professional sports , it seems as though racism has almost become an acceptable barb with which to jibe your opponent			1
increasingly , there are examples of racism within international cricket ; @entity136 and @entity137 have been the latest to clash			1
sledging has always been cutting and personal , but it seems in some cases that a mark is being overstepped			0
or is it all just a big misunderstanding ? we sent a reporter to the heartland of the game , @entity136 , to see if racism really is a problem and if so , to find out what is being done			0
how are children being raised in the game , and are insults -- of whatever nature -- considered acceptable to those who will one day represent their country on the international stage ? we have also looked at the situation in @entity158 - a nation which has for so long struggled with racial tension -- to see whether steps to integrate blacks into historically white teams are working			0
can quota systems ever work ? or are they counter-productive , leaving everyone with a bad taste in the mouth ? perhaps the rainbow nation can look towards the @entity169 for inspiration ? for some , " @entity172 " sporting leagues are still in living memory , but a glance at the @entity175 for example would suggest that integration has been successfully achieved			0
the dark past is never far away though -- only this year a golf commentator caused a furore by suggestion that @entity185 rivals should " lynch him in a back alley			0
" our investigation therefore covers four continents and many different sports , hearing from those that have suffered racism and those who have helped to tackle it			0
can it ever be beaten , or merely suppressed ? is sport a barometer of social attitudes or a platform to initiate wider change ? are racist abusers in sport genuinely prejudiced or merely looking for an edge ? these are hard very questions to answer , but we hope to at least shed some light on the matter and get a debate going in our series , both on - air and online			1
i hope you find it is as stimulating to ponder as it was for us to produce .			0
