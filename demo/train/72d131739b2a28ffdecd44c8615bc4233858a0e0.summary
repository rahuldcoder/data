-- takeoff on one of @entity5 ' new @entity4 test planes is a strangely quiet experience			1
powered by two hulking @entity9 engines , you 'd expect to hear more than just a low whirring noise when tearing down the runway			0
but when leaving the ground and heading into the clear blue skies of a @entity15 morning , there was little else to hear on the newest addition to commercial aviation			0
compounding the hush was the unique nature of the flight			2
most of the select few passengers on board flight @entity24 to @entity25 were from the plane 's manufacturer ; part of a dedicated team undertaking the final tests to make sure the aircraft is certified to enter service in december with its first customer , @entity34			1
the flight was part of @entity5 's @entity38 " route proving " trip , something akin to a world tour where existing and potential customers can take a look at the goods first hand , while the engineers continue to test and tinker			1
named @entity48 , the aircraft that flew across the @entity50 , the @entity52 peninsula and @entity53 , is one of only two of the fleet of five test planes kitted out with a full cabin , so the flight was a good indication of what 's in store for millions of passengers in the coming years			1
seating four abreast in the 42 - seat business class sections , nine abreast in the two economy cabins , this is the future of long - haul travel as presented by the @entity69 plane maker			1
gleaming cabin it 's a competitor to @entity73 's @entity72 and new iterations of the 777 and @entity5 hope it 'll take up a sizeable chunk of the world 's expanding fleet of twin - aisle aircraft			1
at first glance , the gleaming cabin looks simply like a lovely new plane , but dotted throughout are features that @entity5 hopes will set it apart from the competition and impress passengers and airlines alike			1
" with fiber optics we 've integrated the cables for the in - flight entertainment system , moved the control boxes to a panel under the seat and flooring and been able to make the floor flat , " says @entity88 , the aircraft interiors marketing manager			2
that could be sweet relief for those who found themselves with an in - flight entertainment box stopping them from stretching out their feet			2
seat - back displays in economy are 10.6 inches ( 26.9 centimeters ) , which @entity5 say will either be powered by @entity109 or @entity110 , depending on each airline 's preference			1
tablets and smart phones can be plugged in and powered from the seat backs , something that 's becoming a new standard			2
the led lighting onboard has a mind - boggling 16.7 million possible color permutations , which not even a 16 - hour intercontinental trip could cycle through , while the cabin is pressurized to a height equivalent of 6,000 feet ( 1,828 meters ) instead of a more standard 8,000 feet , which it is claimed reduces the effect of jet lag			0
while the plane is touted as being extra wide - bodied ( hence the @entity9 ) , the height of the cabin without central overhead bins is striking ( although that might only be an option for first and business class )			1
for those that favor a window seat on flights , but find the curve of the sidewall cramps their sleep , the new plane has one of the flattest in the business , so cricked necks might also be a thing of the past			0
another little touch is that the bathroom light that comes on and then dims when the door is opened			0
extreme temperature tests for the most part the plane looks ready to come into service tomorrow , but throughout there are hundreds of sensors relaying information to a flight test station set up in the middle of the rear economy cabin			2
two test engineers spent the flight poring over the data , gathering up to 120,000 parameters			0
everything , from temperature at certain points in the cabin to the fuel flow , could be relayed live back to @entity172 in @entity173			0
further route - proving flights to @entity176 and @entity177 are scheduled , and while the flight - worthiness tests have been ongoing for more than a year -- including extreme temperature tests in the @entity180 , stalls , and aborted takeoffs at full speed -- fitting out the interior to clients tastes is a long process too			1
" we expect that be around 10 months , " said @entity187 , head of customer program			0
in fact , he said , it 's been closer to 20 months for the first customer as everything needed to be done more or less from scratch			0
from the height of counters in the galley to the type of carpet , every detail is examined and evaluated by airlines , said @entity187			0
the plane is made of 53 % composite materials helping its fuel efficiency			1
the @entity38 's swooped back winglets could make it as recognizable a sight at airports around the world as the crenelated engine covers of the @entity72			1
" basically if a plane looks good , it flies well , " said @entity213 , a pilot for @entity214 , as he peered out the window at the curvy wing - tips			2
" i 'm a fan of beautiful things and that is a thing of beauty			0
" the @entity38 will come in three sizes , the @entity38 , @entity38 - 900 and @entity224 , offering between 276 and 369 seats			0
as of july there were 742 orders from 38 airlines .			0

the wide - bodied @entity4 is @entity5 's answer to the @entity72
