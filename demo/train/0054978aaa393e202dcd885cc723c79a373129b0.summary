-- " @entity8 " is @entity1 with eight new songs and no band , accompanying himself on guitars with maximum fuzz and electronics , manipulated by producer @entity7			1
the result is one of @entity1 's weirdest studio records -- and that 's saying something in a decade that includes the eco-opera " @entity19 " and the chunky - rock songs about alternative fuel on " @entity18			1
" " @entity8 " is also the most intimate and natural - sounding album @entity1 has made in a long time : just a songwriter making his way through a vividly rendered chaos of memoir , affection and fear			1
it 's as if you hear the songs on the verge of creation , the way @entity1 first hears rhyme and noise in his head			1
on his current tour , where @entity1 has played most of these songs , you can buy a t - shirt that reads " @entity40 ... they said acoustic			1
" even with @entity44 thickening and f --- ing with the atmospheres , " @entity8 " is as solo as it gets			2
that is not obvious at first			0
" @entity49 " opens with arguing layers of iron jangle that sound like they barged in from @entity54 's " @entity53			0
" the last minute is muddy - guitar drone and beeping sound effects , like bits of @entity1 's 1982 hippie - @entity59 fling , " @entity60 , " dropped into one of the crazy horse - freakout codas on 1991 's " @entity63			1
" but earlier in the song , @entity1 sings with chantlike force -- " i feel your love / i feel your strong love / i feel the patience of unconditional love " -- like he 's testing variations on his theme			2
then he gets specific : " i lost some people i was traveling with / i miss the soul and the old friendship			0
" his voice is receding into the drone , but recent passings -- like those of his friends and collaborators @entity83 and @entity84 -- cut through the din like heartbreak			0
the reflection is strong here			0
the riff in " @entity89 " has the repetitive charge of " @entity91 " ; there 's some " mr. soul " in the guitar hook of " someone 's @entity97 " ; " @entity104 " is in the tradition of extended parables like " @entity100 " -- images of a life unraveling and repaired that , at points , may be @entity1 's ( " then came paranoia , and it ran away with me			2
" ) but the most personal thing about " @entity8 " is the sense of a restless master caught in the pursuit of ideas , shaping their expression			2
" @entity118 , " one of two acoustic - guitar songs , is a detailed @entity114 history lesson from @entity116 wars to electric cars			2
yet in one line ( " a mother screamed , and every soul was lost " ) , @entity1 's voice cracks on the peak note -- an impulsive , moving flaw			0
and in " @entity130 , " @entity1 -- his creaky whisper and acoustic guitar buoyed by @entity129 ' watery treatments -- confesses an uncertainty hard to believe in one of rock 's most driven stars : " when i sing about love and war / i do n't really know what i 'm saying			1
" but then the conviction comes back			0
he only has that one way forward , through the music : " i sang in anger , hit another bad chord / but i still try to sing about love and war			0
" " @entity8 " is , ultimately , an extreme simplicity : the sound of a man who wo n't give up			1
