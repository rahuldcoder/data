-- @entity1 is in the record books as the youngest winner of a grand slam but his @entity6 triumph in 1989 is largely remembered for one extraordinary moment in a last 16 match against @entity9			1
few people gave the 17 - year - old @entity12 much chance against the world number one and three - time @entity6 champion			1
the odds lengthened still further when the @entity16 took a two sets lead			2
but @entity1 fought back to level at two sets all , despite suffering from cramp at the end of the fourth set			1
" i actually knew i was in trouble at the end of the fourth because i started cramping			0
our match was about four hours and 37 minutes and against @entity9 on clay , that 's a pretty long time , " he told @entity0			1
but it got even worse as the match went into the decider on @entity30 at @entity30 as @entity1 recounts			1
" in the fifth set , at 2 - 1 in the fifth set , i almost decided to call it quits , i could n't serve , i could n't dig out any balls that were hit in the corners and i walked to the service line , to basically tell the umpire i ca n't play anymore , i 'm done			0
" but @entity1 , who has strong religious beliefs , had a sudden change of heart			2
unbelievable conviction " i get to the service line and i get an unbelievable conviction , just a conviction in my heart and it was almost as if @entity45 was saying , what are you doing ? " it dawned on me that if i was to quit then and there , every other difficult time i have there on the court it was just going to make it that much easier to quit			0
" and from there , it was n't so much a matter of winning and losing , my objective that day was to finish the race which was that match , which was that fifth set			0
win or lose i had to finish the match			0
" the resilient @entity1 started to hit slow looping returns " moonballs " to recover and give himself more time and it worked as he forged a 4 - 3 lead -- until the cramps returned with a vengeance			2
trailing 15 - 30 on his own service , the writing was on the wall when @entity1 decided on an unconventional approach , which was to decide the outcome of the match			2
" then at 15 - 30 , spur of the moment , i was just like , i 'm going to throw an underhand serve in here , cause i 'm not doing anything off my first serve anyways			0
" let 's see if maybe i can scrape a point			0
i hit the underhand serve , @entity9 was kind of surprised about it , moved , kind of got squeezed in because of the spin and had to come in because the serve was so short			1
i hit a passing shot , clipped the tape and it went off the top of his racket and the crowd went absolutely nuts !			0
mental battle " and you can see @entity9 going back to the baseline to return the 30 - all point and he was kind of going like this ( tapping his head ) and it became a sort of mental battle			2
" @entity9 did not win another game as @entity1 closed out the match , but it was another unconventional tactic which sealed his victory as he forged two match points on his opponent 's service			1
" i had two match points so i might as well take a crack at one of them			0
i 've got a second serve coming , he 's got to be a little bit tight , my shots have been going in so i might as well take one good rip at it , i 've got another one if i happen to miss it and that 's what my mentality was			0
" @entity1 's " tactic " was to stand right in on @entity9 's delivery almost at the service line and it rattled the legendary @entity16			1
" the crowd started going nuts , they started whistling and stuff like that			0
he actually looked up at @entity127 ( the chair umpire ) and was like hey , the crowd 's making a noise , can i hit a first serve , and @entity127 told him no , and he stepped up and threw the double , double fault			0
" it was an extraordinary end to an extraordinary match and @entity1 eventually progressed into the title match against @entity135 's @entity134			1
once again he faced an uphill battle as @entity134 recovered from a set down to lead two sets to one and was on top in the fourth			1
" the fourth set i should have lost , i was down 11 break points and i only had one break point , it just happened to be on set point , " @entity1 said			1
" and i snuck that one , and then i think @entity134 was a little tired in the fifth even though he was up early with a break			2
" history books once it was retrieved , @entity1 charged through the decider , taking it 6 - 2 to claim his place in the tennis record books with the momentous events in @entity154 taking place on the middle weekend of that @entity6 , @entity1 wanted to dedicate his victory to the wider @entity158 community in his native @entity159 and around the world			1
" i almost kind of feel that it was almost @entity45 's purpose for me to win that @entity6			1
" i really think it was about putting a smile on @entity158 people 's faces when there was n't a whole lot to smile about			0
that 's part of the reason why i think the @entity6 happened in the way that it did			2
" it 's 23 years since @entity1 's unexpected triumph - his only grand slam title			1
he lost to @entity174 in the 1995 @entity6 final and to @entity176 and @entity177 at the @entity179 and @entity180 finals of 1996			1
the 1995 loss to @entity183 legend muster still hurts , but @entity1 believes it would have been hard to match the impact of his 1989 triumph			1
" i do n't know if any grand slam win following that one would have been more special			1
that being said , i would have liked to have won in 1995 in the finals but it was not meant to be , " he said			0
major force @entity1 remained a major force on the @entity193 tour throughout the 90s , a decade which began with a notable triumph for the @entity159			1
" i think the other highlights of my career would have to be winning the @entity199 in 1990 and a career @entity200 in the world , being inducted into the @entity203 in 2008 and also meeting my wife @entity204 through tennis ! i have much to be thankful for ! " he added			0
@entity1 retired from the main tour in 2003 , but still competes on the @entity207 and in @entity208			2
he pairs up in mixed doubles with his wife of four years @entity212 , who is a former two - time @entity213 champion from @entity214			0
they have a young daughter , " hopefully there 'll be a racket in her hand sometime soon , " said @entity1 , who is a keen supporter of junior tennis			2
he also keeps an eye on the achievements of @entity158 players and welcomed @entity226 's victory in the women 's singles at last year 's @entity6			2
" i do know @entity226 a little bit , i did send her a congratulatory email			0
" @entity232 connection @entity1 is also in content with another @entity12 who is making making the sort of headlines he did back in 1989			1
both he and @entity237 basketball sensation @entity232 share a strong @entity239 faith and they have spoken about their wider responsibilities			0
" as far as being a role model , i think it 's very important for @entity232 to realize that he is just that not only for the @entity158 community but also everywhere else			0
" to have the opportunity to touch and impact lives is such a honor and privilege and i hope @entity232 will use the platform that he has to inspire and encourage people wherever he goes			0
" @entity1 was certainly an inspirational figure during his tennis career and epic triumph at the @entity6 in 1989 looks set to stay in the record books for many years to come .			1

@entity1 won @entity6 in 1989 aged just 17
win over top seed @entity9 in last 16 paved way for grand slam triumph
@entity1 *famously* served underhand in the fifth set against the @entity262
he beat @entity134 in the final in five sets but never won another grand slam title
