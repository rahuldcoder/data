-- caramel apples are a perk of fall , and while most of us have fond childhood memories associated with this autumnal treat , one of our editors , @entity10 , helped them grow up			1
her recipe for @entity13 is a great treat for adults on @entity16			1
@entity18 's @entity17 : candy - coated caramel apples since this is @entity22 and we believe most things are better when you make them yourself , we make our caramel from scratch , replacing some of the standard heavy cream with reduced red wine			1
not only do the coated apples develop a beautiful , reddish color , but the wine also deepens the caramel flavor and adds a hint of rich fruitiness			1
@entity18 's @entity17 : best baked apples if you prefer bourbon to @entity38 , do n't despair ; these treats are just as good when made with other boozy additions			1
we 've included variations such as @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 for delicious , grown - up versions of our favorite childhood treat			1
because who 's to say kids should have all the fun on @entity16 ? @entity18 's @entity17 : @entity51 @entity13 ( serves 8 ) we prefer @entity54 apples for this recipe , but @entity56 and @entity57 are also acceptable			1
for individually wrapped treats , refrigerate coated apples for 4 hours before wrapping in plastic wrap and securing with a ribbon or twist tie			2
apples can be stored at room temperature in an airtight container or wrapped in plastic for 1 day , or refrigerated for up to 4 days			2
1½ cups red wine 8 @entity54 apples , stemmed , washed and dried thoroughly 8 wooden chopsticks ( 4 pairs , divided ) or skewers 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 cup ( 7 ounces ) packed light brown sugar ½ cup light corn syrup 1 cup heavy cream 1 teaspoon @entity78 sea salt @entity18 's @entity17 : @entity79 1			1
boil wine in small saucepan over medium heat until reduced to ½ cup , 8 to 10 minutes			2
meanwhile , line baking sheet with parchment paper or wax paper			0
stand apples on baking sheet and insert chopstick or skewer into stem end of each apple			2
melt butter in large saucepan over medium - high heat			2
add brown sugar and corn syrup , and cook , stirring , until sugar is melted , about 2 minutes			0
stir in ¾ cup cream , bring to boil and cook until mixture reaches 235 degrees , about 5 minutes			0
remove from heat and carefully stir in reduced red wine ( mixture will bubble vigorously )			1
return pan to medium - high heat and continue cooking until mixture reaches 255 degrees , 4 to 5 minutes			2
remove pan from heat and stir in remaining cream			0
let cool until mixture reaches 200 degrees , 3 to 5 minutes			0
holding one apple by its chopstick , immerse apple in caramel with swirling motion , tilting pan if necessary to pool caramel deep enough to coat at least ¾ of apple			2
lift apple out of caramel and hold over pan for about 10 seconds , allowing excess caramel to drip back into pan , then hold apple upside down over pan for about 15 seconds , allowing caramel to begin to set			0
return to prepared baking sheet and repeat with remaining apples and caramel			1
if caramel cools too much and becomes too thick to evenly coat apples , briefly return pan to low heat to loosen caramel , but do not let caramel simmer again			1
if desired , sprinkle @entity78 sea salt lightly around top third of caramel			0
let apples stand at room temperature for at least 1 hour before serving			0

continue with recipe as directed			0
roll bottom third of apples in ½ cup chopped toasted pecans and ¼ teaspoon @entity78 sea salt			0
