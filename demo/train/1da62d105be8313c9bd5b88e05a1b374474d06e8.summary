-- there is something deeply unsettling about this prickly , suspenseful first feature from writer director @entity4			2
although " @entity11 " is set exclusively in bucolic surroundings , on a farm somewhere in the @entity8 and in a luxurious lakeside cabin in @entity10 , the film is pregnant with dread			1
the threat of violence , implied or imagined , haunts its troubled , many - named heroine from the opening minutes , when she makes her bid for freedom			0
she wakes in the pre-dawn , picks her way out of a slumbering room , heads out the front door and into the trees			0
but she does n't get far before someone raises the alarm for " @entity25 , " and she breaks into a run			0
later , after it seems she 's free and clear , the same man catches up with her in at a diner in a nearby town			2
he sidles up and makes easy conversation			0
there is no coercion , no physical duress in this public place , but the menace is almost overpowering			0
has she been relinquished ? was she free to leave all along ? @entity25 -- or @entity38 , as she calls herself when she phones for help -- does not believe it			1
and sensing her traumatized , near - catatonic panic , nor do we			0
but it 's only gradually that we come to comprehend the reasons for her great distress			2
@entity4 ( who produced the chilly " afterschool " ) does a very clever thing here			0
he cuts between @entity38 's painfully incremental rehabilitation and recovery at the home rented by her older half - sister and her architect husband ( @entity55 and @entity56 ) , and flashbacks to @entity38 's induction to the commune from which we 've already seen her escape			1
but the transitions are hard cuts , and often intentionally disorienting , so we 're not always immediately sure what 's past and present			2
it 's a confusion we share with @entity38 , who is haunted by nightmares from the farm and acts out in ways that her family is hard - pressed to accept , let alone understand			1
@entity4 gestures here towards a surrealist satire in the culture - clash between the bourgeois sister and the reprogrammed , defiantly anti-materialist , sexually uninhibited @entity38 -- though it 's not clear his heart is really in it			1
the commune -- which initially seems idyllic and empowering -- gradually reveals its dark side , embodied both in the passive group - think of its members , and most disturbingly of all in the messianic @entity82 ( @entity81 )			0
his soft - spoken self - help platitudes are more dr. @entity84 than @entity85 , until he gets to cocking his pistol and teaching the girls how to shoot			0
@entity81 is equally convincing , whether he 's serenading @entity25 on his guitar or blooding her in preparation for a nocturnal raid on the neighboring holiday cottages ; a little ad hoc redistribution of wealth to supplement the farm 's organic crop -- maybe the one sequence where @entity4 , who has a talent for insinuation and withholding , oversteps the mark			2
but the movie stands or falls on @entity102 , and @entity4 hit paydirt in casting @entity104			1
the younger sister to @entity106 , the 21 - year - old @entity104 is sensationally good , flipping between the innocent , impressionable beguilement of @entity25 ( as @entity82 rechristens her ) and @entity38 's crippling , bed - wetting anxiety and anger			1
it 's a punishing role but a star - making performance , a spellbinding portrait of a shattered young woman who has been systemically and cynically stripped of all autonomy , and who does n't know if the pieces will ever fit back together again .			1
