that does n't surprise most people			1
because i 'm a crime novelist , they expect me to peer into the dark , shivery corners everyone else avoids			1
but the reasons i love graveyards have little to do with the spooky			2
to me , they 're beautiful green spaces and open - air art museums			2
while there are two famous @entity13 cemeteries that rate as tourist attractions in their own right -- @entity17 and @entity18 -- there are others that deserve to be better known			2
here are my 10 favorite final resting places around the world			1
they should be on every traveler 's list of things to see before they ... you know			2
@entity29 , @entity30 close your eyes and imagine 478 acres of rolling hills , complete with several ponds , a lake , a glorious view of the @entity37 and thousands of historic monuments			2
throw in a chapel that 's modeled on @entity41 's @entity40 at @entity43 's @entity42 , and you 've got @entity45 's spectacular @entity29			2
the cemetery took a beating from @entity48 , losing some 300 mature trees , but the grand mausoleums and monuments are still in place			1
this 1838 cemetery boasts @entity55 status , in part because it 's where the @entity57 was fought in 1776			1
but it 's just as significant to bird - watchers , and it 's a member of the @entity61			2
@entity29 offers a variety of ticketed tours that take you around its expansive grounds by trolley or into its catacombs by flashlight , but visitors are welcome to walk the grounds daily			2
@entity72 , @entity73 a sign at the entrance to the @entity72 claims that " famous , infamous and unknown bostonians are buried here			1
" this small cemetery on @entity78 , founded in 1660 , holds many revolutionary war heroes , including @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83			1
one of the grandest monuments belongs to @entity86 's family ( though @entity87 himself rests in @entity88 )			2
one of the more infamous residents is @entity90 , a magistrate who presided over the @entity92 witch trials			2
almost every headstone is eye - catching in its own right , with elaborate carvings of skeletons sporting scythes , winged skulls , sly - looking cherubs , and other symbols of mourning , as well as poetic epitaphs			2
the towering @entity105 revival gate that marks the entryway is a work of art in its own right			2
@entity109 daily , the @entity72 has excellent signage to point out the most famous -- and infamous -- graves			1
9 haunted spots across @entity13 @entity113 , @entity114 if you 're not used to seeing cemeteries filled with baby strollers and joggers , brace yourself before visiting @entity113			2
it 's best to regard it as a public park that happens to have a lot of permanent residents			2
i 'd love to say that locals ' enthusiasm for the place is part of my hometown 's @entity131 tradition -- back in 1876 , when this cemetery opened , having family picnics at gravesites was considered normal behavior			1
but it 's also true that when you see @entity113 's rolling green hills , botanical gardens , leafy trees , and elegant fountains , you know that it 's the cemetery 's incredible beauty that draws people in			1
there are grand mausoleums here , belonging to families like the @entity152 and the @entity153 , and famous graves , such as pianist @entity156 's resting place , but the real reason to visit is to enjoy glorious green space in the middle of a frenetic city			0
open daily from dawn to dusk			0
@entity164 cemetery no. 1 , @entity165 @entity165 never had an easy time burying people -- with its water table , they could get unburied when it rained			1
so they devised a city of the dead with above - ground tombs and opened @entity164 no. 1 in 1789			0
its whitewashed crypts , some topped with mournful statues and surrounded by wrought - iron gates , have a ghostly beauty that has been captured on film , most famously in " @entity182			0
" the cemetery , as racially diverse as @entity165 itself , is a stop on the @entity186 , and while it 's primarily a catholic burial place , it has a section for others , too			1
tour a @entity165 cemetery in pictures one of its most famous residents may be the 19th - century voodoo priestess @entity195 , whose remains are believed to be in the @entity198 tomb , and occult offerings are left there in her honor			1
guided tours are available through @entity203 , but visitors are welcome to wander through every day except @entity205			0
@entity206 , @entity207 situated on 37 acres in @entity207 , @entity208 is as almost much a nature reserve as it is a historic resting place			0
wild as a classic @entity214 garden , it features trees , shrubs and flowers growing without human intervention , and they provide cover to @entity221 's many living inhabitants , which include foxes			0
in the midst of all this greenery are magnificent stone monuments , some dating back to 1839 and so covered in ivy that the grounds can resemble the land that time forgot			0
but with famous people such as @entity233 , @entity234 and @entity235 interred here , it is n't likely that anyone will ever pass it by			0
@entity208 is divided into @entity240 and @entity241 cemeteries , with the latter only available for viewing by tour ( buy tickets in advance through the website )			0
@entity221 charges an admission fee , but you can explore it on your own			0
@entity252 fan ? follow the trail of real witches @entity255 , @entity256 this is the ultimate @entity258 of graveyards			1
it was established by @entity261 himself in 1804 , with the emperor declaring , " every citizen has the right to be buried regardless of race or religion			1
" since then , @entity255 has welcomed writers ( @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity271 , @entity272 , @entity273 and @entity274 ) ; singers ( @entity276 , @entity277 ) ; artists ( @entity278 , @entity279 , @entity280 , @entity281 , @entity282 ) ; and composers ( @entity284 , @entity285 ) , among others			0
but the most popular gravesite of all is that of rock star @entity288 , whose relatively small grave has been so often vandalized that it is now guarded			1
the cemetery is open daily and visitors are welcome to explore			1
there 's no admission charge			0
@entity294 , @entity295 it 's a curious thing to stand on a city street and look up -- way up -- to spot the cemetery			1
@entity295 was , at one time , home to one of the wealthiest @entity302 communities in @entity303			1
but its inhabitants were still subject to some rather draconian rules , including one commanding that @entity302 could only be buried on a single city block			1
what 's now called the @entity294 was that burial ground , and it was used continuously from the early 15th century until 1787			0
there was nowhere to go but up , and so centuries of tombs and monuments lie buried inside as more earth was brought in			1
there are some 12,000 tombstones at the top , though thousands more are buried here			1
it 's a poignant thing to see so many headstones jammed together , yet each one is elaborately carved , inlaid with flora and fauna , symbols of a trade or hands reaching to heaven			0
open daily , with an admission fee			0
@entity328 , @entity329 in @entity331 's capital city , @entity328 is considered a chief attraction			0
walled off from the tony neighborhood it inhabits , it 's effectively a city - within - the - city , founded in 1822 and filled with elaborately carved tombs and fine @entity340 statuary			0
the most popular spot is the @entity343 family tomb , which is where the country 's most famous first lady , @entity344 , is buried			1
( the @entity347 are her father 's family ; because the controversial @entity344 's body was stolen and mutilated by her husband 's enemies after her death , it 's now heavily protected			0
) even if the names of famous @entity331 families are n't familiar to foreign visitors , their extravagant memorials leave a lasting impression			0
free tours are available in a variety of languages , and visitors are welcome to explore on their own			0
the longest airline flight in the world @entity366 , @entity367 @entity368 and @entity331 have always been great rivals , so perhaps it should n't be a surprise that @entity367 has a cemetery that aims to be even more spectacular than @entity329 '			1
spread over 210 acres , and divided into elegant streets and boulevards , the @entity366 has massive tombs designed to resemble @entity378 temples , @entity380 palazzos and other grand structures â€” they 're so huge , you might start to wonder whether any living family members could be inside , too			0
but the most fascinating part of the site is the @entity385 to the @entity386 , a large - scale memorial to those who vanished under @entity390 's brutal regime			0
undoubtedly not by coincidence , the @entity390 family tomb is a stone 's - throw away			0
( @entity390 died in 2006 , but his family , fearing vandalism , did n't place his cremated remains at the family tomb			0
) open daily to visitors			0
@entity400 , @entity401 i 'm embarrassed to admit that , when i visited the @entity400 , on the eastern side of @entity401 , i was expecting a grove of olive trees			1
instead , i found an expansive cemetery that dates back to biblical times and is still in use			1
one of the oldest monuments , at the foot of the mount in the @entity411 , is to @entity413 's son @entity412			0
according to the @entity414 , the @entity400 is where the @entity415 will first appear , and so it 's the first place where the dead will rise from their graves			1
the @entity302 cemetery contains biblical kings as well as more modern @entity424 leaders such as @entity425 , but there are also @entity427 and @entity428 burial grounds here			1
wherever you stand on the mount , it offers a uniquely beautiful view of ancient , walled @entity401 .			0

the @entity72 is the final home for many revolutionary war heroes
@entity288 is buried in a @entity256 cemetery established by @entity261 in 1804
the @entity400 is where the @entity415 will appear , says the @entity414
