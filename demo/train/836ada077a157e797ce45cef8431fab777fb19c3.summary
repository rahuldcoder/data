-- @entity2 champions @entity1 have confirmed the dismissal of coach @entity4 , opening the way for former @entity7 manager @entity6 to replace him			1
@entity4 guided @entity1 to the @entity9 league title for three successive seasons			0
ironically , the 43 - year - old @entity4 , who guided @entity1 to three successive @entity9 league titles , is now the favorite to take @entity6 's former job at @entity14			1
@entity1 -- who won the first of their three titles in 2006 because those above them were demoted or deducted points over the matchfixing scandal -- released a statement about the sacking			0
" @entity1 have informed @entity4 that he has been relieved of his role as coach , especially because of his comments that he was not going to stay after the end of the season following the @entity30 tie against @entity31 on march 11 , " read their statement			1
@entity4 , however , rescinded those comments the following day declaring that he had made them in the heat of the moment following @entity1 's elimination from the competition , losing 3 - 0 on aggregate			1
@entity1 's reasons for sacking @entity4 appear less credible after club president @entity40 announced that the coach had changed his mind about leaving at the end of the season			2
" i 've had a talk with @entity4 , who confirmed to me that he wanted to stay at @entity1 next year to see out his contract			0
he wants to win the @entity30 for us next season , " @entity40 said on march 12			0
" @entity4 's words surprised me , i did n't expect it and even less so i believe the people close to him			0
" @entity6 , nicknamed ' @entity6 ' for guiding @entity53 to the @entity30 in 2004 and then @entity7 to two @entity55 titles , would not come cheap , but the exit of @entity4 has cost @entity1 dear too as his contract , which runs till 2012 , will leave him 24 million euros richer as compensation			1
however , @entity4 was unable to make @entity1 into viable @entity30 contenders despite the three @entity2 titles			2
@entity4 is the ninth coaching casualty under @entity40 , following @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 .			0
