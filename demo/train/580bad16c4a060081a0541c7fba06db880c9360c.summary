@entity0 , @entity1 -- a senior government official arrived monday in @entity7 amid rumors that he had defected , @entity5 's state - run @entity4 newspaper reported			1
@entity9 arrived with nine of his family members on a private plane from @entity12 , @entity13 , the newspaper reported , citing an unidentified airport official			1
@entity12 is about 150 miles ( 240 kilometers ) west of @entity0			2
meanwhile , a @entity17 defense official confirmed monday that @entity1 forces loyal to @entity19 fired a short - range scud missile on sunday at a rebel stronghold , but by all accounts the missile failed to reach its target			1
the official said the missile was launched from a government - held area 50 miles east of @entity28 and landed 50 miles east of @entity29 in the desert			1
in @entity7 , @entity1 @entity32 officials did not greet @entity9 's plane when it pulled up to @entity7 's @entity34 , which is the arrival point for private planes , fueling speculation that @entity9 may have abandoned leader @entity19 , @entity4 said			1
the newspaper and an official at @entity40 identified @entity9 as @entity1 's minister of the interior			1
however , a @entity1 government official -- whose information has proved reliable in the past but who is not allowed to talk to the news media for attribution -- identified @entity9 as an administrative director at the @entity48 and a former @entity1 minister			1
the official said he could confirm that @entity9 had traveled to @entity5 with his family on nonofficial business , but could not specify the nature of the trip			1
a @entity1 government website reported in june that @entity9 had been sworn in as deputy minister of public security			1
@entity1 's interior ministry is called the @entity59			1
asked about the apparent defection , @entity0 government spokesman @entity60 said he would not comment on any personal decisions by @entity9			1
" in the last while , we noticed that he had intense social pressures on him			2
it 's probably not appropriate that we talk about it in detail because it 's personal			1
" @entity60 added , " truthfully , he has fallen under a lot of social and emotional pressure as we 've noticed			2
he could n't handle it and preferred that he left			2
that 's a personal decision			1
" @entity9 's departure comes as rebels have been reporting major advances toward their goal of cutting off @entity1 's coastal road , the @entity0 regime 's lifeline , and reaching the capital			1
in the coastal city of @entity85 , clashes were ongoing			2
" at the moment , it 's quite hard to say who is in complete control of the city , " said @entity86 , a reporter for the @entity87 who left the city monday			1
" the rebels say they have 80 % of it under their control , but it is a very fluid situation			1
" @entity101 snipers were holed up in buildings in the main square , where rebels were firing at them with rocket - propelled grenades , she said			2
rebel fighters controlled all but the eastern part of the city , said @entity110 , who is a rebel fighter and a source who has proven reliable in the past			0
@entity19 forces shelled @entity115 with grad rockets from nearby @entity117 , killing two rebels , bringing the number of dead in @entity85 to 11 , with dozens more wounded , @entity110 said			0
@entity123 airstrikes , though , have hit @entity19 forces in @entity117 , aiding the rebels , he said			0
@entity125 , rebel forces entered the towns of @entity127 and @entity128 late sunday , @entity110 said			1
twenty - two rebel fighters died and 38 were wounded in the towns , he said			0
west of @entity128 , rebels surrounded @entity19 forces inside a military camp , he said			0
clashes were continuing for control of @entity135 , on the plains of the western mountains , @entity110 said			1
and in @entity141 , east of @entity139 , also in the western mountains , rebel fighters had surrounded the city and negotiations were under way for @entity19 forces to turn themselves in , @entity110 said			0
but a @entity0 government spokesman denied the assertions that rebels were advancing			2
@entity19 himself , in an address broadcast monday on @entity1 state television , urged @entity1 to fight opposition forces and " cleanse this sweet and honorable land			1
" cheers from the crowd accompanied the speech , cries of " @entity158 , @entity1 , @entity19 and nothing else " at times drowning out @entity19			1
" we dance and sing despite the strikes ! the strikes will be over and @entity123 will be defeated , " @entity19 said			0
" move always forward to the challenge ; pick up your weapons ; go to the fight in order to liberate @entity1 inch by inch from the traitors and from @entity123			1
be prepared to fight if they hit the ground			0
" claims of control over the city of @entity85 -- if true -- would be a strategic blow against government forces , since the road through the city serves as a critical supply line to @entity0 from the west and has an oil terminal			2
in his news conference monday evening , @entity60 denied the assertions and said @entity19 forces were in " complete control " of @entity188 after having halted rebel attacks there			1
" there are a few armed gangs inside the city who took advantage of the opportunity to enter but they are limited , " he said			0
" all of south @entity85 is protected			0
the armed gangs tried to attack people in their homes , occupy a school and raid shops			0
the government closed off a main road for the protection of the people			0
" the rebels say that they were the ones who closed the coastal road			0
@entity60 said heavy @entity123 airstrikes were continuing to strike some coastal cities , including @entity85 , with the eastern city of @entity29 bearing the brunt of the attacks			0
" to be honest , they 're unable to shake our civilians or our youth , " he said			0
he said the rebels suffered heavy casualties			0
" hundreds of them injured and tens killed			0
because of this , now people in the eastern regions and even the armed gangs refer to @entity29 as a cemetery			0
@entity29 is synonymous with death			0
" in @entity135 , 40 rebels were killed by @entity232 forces , who took three tanks and a number of weapons from them , he said			0
@entity60 said officials were negotiating with international companies that have expressed interest in returning to @entity1 , he said			1
the goal is for them to resume operations " very soon			0
" @entity60 added that the @entity0 government forces were planning to " free " the key port city of @entity245 from rebel forces			0
" we ca n't tell everything but we 're in a position to free @entity245 , " he said			0
" it 's not an easy feat. " rebel commander @entity252 rejected @entity60 's assertions that @entity19 's forces controlled @entity115 and @entity127 , which is also along the western supply road , as well as the government 's claims to @entity258 , another city on a key supply route leading to @entity0 from the south			2
" the next few days will prove him wrong , " the rebel field commander predicted			0
@entity123 said sunday it had struck a @entity19 military facility in @entity258			2
rebel spokesman @entity264 has said that rebels control the coastal road connecting @entity85 with a post on the @entity13 border , but that @entity19 forces still controlled the post			1
reports from @entity13 's state - owned @entity272 corroborated the account			2
@entity2 has not been able to independently confirm battle claims , including who controls @entity188			1
@entity277 claims of rebel successes indicate rapid progress when compared with positions rebels claimed on previous days			0
the government in @entity0 has consistently downplayed claims of rebel victories and played up the strength of @entity19 's forces			2
" you have to remember we are very powerful , " @entity60 said saturday			0
" the tens of thousands and tens of thousands of volunteers are armed right now			0
it does n't matter whether @entity123 advances or not , whether rebels advance or not , because we will always be able to fight , in a year 's time , in two years , in three years			2
" five months into the @entity1 war , the rebels have won international support in their effort to oust @entity19			1
they have been aided by @entity123 airstrikes that began in march after the @entity296 approved a resolution that ordered civilians be protected			0
@entity2 's @entity299 , @entity300 , @entity301 , @entity302 , @entity303 , @entity304 , @entity305 and @entity306 contributed to this report .			1
