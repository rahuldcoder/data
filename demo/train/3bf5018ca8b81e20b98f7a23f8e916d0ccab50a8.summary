-- words like " landmark " and " historic " are being used to describe this week 's @entity4 - @entity3			0
more than 40 heads of state , the president , dozens of @entity4 ceos , celebrities , activists and several members of @entity9 -- myself included -- are participating in the three - day event			0
every issue affecting the continent , from combating wildlife trafficking to food security , is on the agenda			0
yet , of the 53 hours of official meetings scheduled for the summit , only two are dedicated to the critical issue of governance			1
that is scant treatment for what is perhaps the greatest impediment to security and economic growth in @entity30			1
it also sends the wrong message about our shared priorities and values			0
in @entity30 , electing fresh , new leaders is not something people do often			1
consider this : the 10 current longest - serving @entity41 leaders have held their offices for a total of 252 years			1
three of these leaders ( @entity46 of @entity47 , @entity48 of @entity49 , and @entity50 of @entity51 ) have not been invited to the summit because they are in poor standing with the @entity4			1
of those receiving an invite , @entity55 's @entity54 and @entity57 's @entity56 were unwisely hailed as " new @entity41 leaders " during the @entity62 administration , while others came to power when @entity65 was in the @entity66			2
needless to say , presidents serving in their 25th year generally do n't promote free and fair elections and good governance			1
elections are a pillar of democracy and good governance			1
when conducted freely , fairly and regularly , they give citizens their most effective tool for holding their leaders accountable and pressing policy makers for action and reform			2
in fact , the @entity81 has shown that political competition , primarily through elections , is associated with improvements to a country 's business environment			2
not only do elections bolster economies , they can improve security			2
take , for example , @entity93			0
decades of protracted conflict and a deadly civil war resulted from corruption and massive human rights abuses by war criminal @entity98 , along with the political exclusion of whole swaths of the country 's populace			0
but inclusive and democratic elections in 2006 brought to power @entity105 , @entity30 's first elected female head of state			1
now , @entity93 is experiencing a much - needed period of political reconciliation and improved security			0
while @entity93 certainly still face a number of challenges -- including the recent @entity114 outbreak -- inclusive elections have proven to be a stabilizing force in @entity30			1
despite the overstay of too many @entity41 leaders , there are reasons for hope			2
eleven @entity41 countries are planning to hold elections next year , and 15 more countries have an election scheduled for 2016			1
in the next two years , more than half the leaders in @entity126 are slated to stand for re-election			2
each election day in these countries over the next two years will be a defining moment for the future of governance across the continent			0
5 reasons @entity137 's @entity30 leaders ' summit matters the @entity4 can not be absent during this critical transition			1
we should support programs that improve the transparency of elections and encourage the peaceful transfer of power , which , unfortunately , far too many @entity41 have yet to see			0
most importantly , the @entity4 should push back on those leaders who seek to amend their constitutions to create imperial , indefinite presidencies			0
two leaders most recently accused of seeking such constitutional changes -- @entity149 of the @entity150 and @entity151 of @entity152 -- are in town for the @entity3			0
allowing them to return home without pressing for free , fair and regular elections would be an affront to the citizens of these two countries			1
opinion : @entity30 and @entity4 : invest in human rights president @entity137 once pressed for good governance aggressively			1
in 2009 , when he traveled to @entity163 and addressed that country 's parliament , he took a " no excuses " approach toward @entity41 leaders			0
in an interview just before landing on the continent , the president noted that , " i 'm a big believer that @entity41 are responsible for @entity30 ... for many years we 've made excuses about corruption or poor governance ; that this was somehow the consequence of neo-colonialism , or the @entity30 has been oppressive , or racism			1
i 'm not a believer in excuses			0
... i think that it 's very important for @entity41 leadership to take responsibility and be held accountable			0
" nice words , unfortunately undermined by a summit agenda that shorts good governance			2
join us on @entity188 / @entity187 .			0

rep. @entity190 *applauds* @entity30 summit , but says it should focus more on governance
he says in @entity30 , electing fresh , new leaders is not something people do often
presidents serving in their 25th year , he says , do n't always promote free and fair elections
