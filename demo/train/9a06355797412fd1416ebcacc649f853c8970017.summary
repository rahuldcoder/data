-- so here 's the great pop album everybody was hoping @entity4 would make , ever since he ran wild on " @entity5 " three years ago			1
it was n't just @entity4 's dynamite - with - a - laser - beam voice that got him into our national knickers : it was his warmth , his humor , his burlesque bravado			2
his 2010 debut , " @entity18 , " was a typical " idol " quickie -- decent , but it needed more personality			1
" trespassing " delivers , with a mix of tinsel disco - club sleaze and leather - boy love ballads			1
while he excels in a radio cheddar bomb like " @entity24 , " he gets deeper in slow jams like " @entity26 " and " @entity27			0
" but all over " @entity28 , " @entity4 sings everything like @entity30 in a thong			0
