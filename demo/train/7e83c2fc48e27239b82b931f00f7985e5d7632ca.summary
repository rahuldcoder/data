@entity0 , @entity1 -- in a recent discussion of what his administration might accomplish , @entity3 claimed that " by virtue of the policies that we put in place , we 'd get the unemployment rate down to 6 % , and perhaps a little lower , " over a period of four years			1
is this goal attainable ? it is			2
indeed , it is not that tough a task			2
if the @entity19 avoids new growth - retarding policies , such as the tax hikes scheduled for january 1 , the economy 's natural adjustments will lower unemployment substantially			1
these include downward adjustments in wages , reallocation of job - seekers from slower to faster growing sectors and regions , reduced in - migration plus increased out - migration , and withdrawals from the labor force			1
these adjustments do not always work quickly or for everyone ( not every former construction worker can become a computer technician )			2
but history suggests the adjustments do occur , as they have since the recession began			0
over the next four years , they will continue to lower the unemployment rate , if not to 6 % , at least near that territory			1
the more important task for either presidential candidate is restoring the economy to its prerecession growth path			1
real gdp has historically grown about 3 % per year , and major downturns have been followed by strong recoveries			1
within two to three years , therefore , output is typically " back where it would have been			1
" in this recession , the rapid recovery phase has so far been absent ; real gdp is still well below where one would have predicted pre- 2008 , and with average growth under 3 % since the recession ended , the gap grows larger every quarter			1
so can @entity3 , or anyone , get us back to a higher growth rate ? yes			1
here is a program that will restore @entity19 economic performance : cancel all the tax increases scheduled to take effect at the end of 2012 and provide tax stability going forward			1
make ( all ) the @entity69 tax cuts permanent			0
repeal the alternative minimum tax			0
eliminate the health care law 's increases in the hospital insurance tax			0
all this will stimulate in the short term and set the stage for long - term growth			1
reform the tax code by eliminating the misguided deductions , exemptions , credits and loopholes that distort incentives and reward special interests			0
these features include big - ticket items like the deductibility of mortgage interest and employer - paid health insurance premiums , plus myriad small but senseless other provisions			0
lower the corporate income tax rate			0
the @entity19 corporate tax environment is one of the least business - friendly in the world			0
driving investment overseas can not be good policy			0
slow the growth of entitlements			1
the @entity19 can afford a social safety net , but our current programs are not sustainable , even in a robustly growing economy			2
everyone should agree , at a minimum , to cuts that are sufficient to prevent these programs -- @entity108 , @entity109 , and @entity110 -- from bankrupting the country			0
despite recent difficulties , the @entity19 is still an attractive destination for those seeking a better life			0
by expanding immigration for low - skill workers , we restrain labor costs and reduce out - migration of manufacturing and other business			1
by easing immigration for high - skill workers -- many of them trained in the @entity19 at taxpayer expense -- we get a return on our investment and retain industrious and innovative people			2
scale back military involvements around the world			2
a strong national defense makes sense , but it must focus on protecting the @entity19 , not paying for @entity136 's defense or trying to force democracy down the throats of countries that are not receptive			0
cease the campaign against carbon - based fuels			0
green energy may have its day , but only when coal , oil and gas become truly scarce			0
in the foreseeable future , traditional energy is much cheaper , and subsidies for alternative energy are a waste			0
stop scapegoating the rich and pretending that tax - hikes on the 1 % can balance the budget			2
everyone knows the numbers do not add up			0
anti-business rhetoric , which casts all success as undeserved , and which fails to recognize the improvements in material well - being that result from entrepreneurial success , just drive away talented people and guarantee our economic demise			2
if the @entity19 adopts these policies , it will not only attain @entity3 's 6 % unemployment goal , it will once again be the economic beacon of the world			1
what 's wrong with that ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity174 .			1

@entity3 predicted he could reduce unemployment to 6 % in four years
@entity174 says that kind of economic improvement is *n't* fast enough
he says the economy has recovered at a faster pace from previous downturns
@entity174 : cut taxes , *promote* immigration , reduce military and slow growth of entitlements
