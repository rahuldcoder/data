@entity0 , @entity1 -- he arrives in the early morning hours , when the downtown streets here are empty and quiet			1
former @entity7 soldier @entity6 has been convicted of raping and killing a 14 - year - old @entity10 girl			1
an electric gate jerks to life as the black sedan with tinted windows pulls into a parking lot protected by an iron fence			2
it 's five blocks from the local county jail to the @entity20			2
not even a five - minute drive			2
this is the only freedom @entity6 knows			1
he 's ushered from the car by a contingent of @entity7 marshals			2
it 's 30 feet out in the open air			2
a brief chance to look up at the clouds			2
a moment to hear sounds not reverberated against cell walls : a bird , a car engine , a breeze in nearby trees			2
he is a lanky 24 - year - old			2
he looks lean , like he could grow a little more			2
not really a man , but too old to be called a boy			0

the orange prison coveralls make him look a bit taller			0
the jury never sees @entity6 in the fluorescent jumpsuit			1
inside the federal courthouse there is a change of clothes			0
usually it 's a button - down shirt and a pair of khakis			0
he keeps his cuffs buttoned			0
he looks nerdish , and you half expect him to start working on the courtroom computers			1
not like a man who once asked @entity59 agents if they thought he was " a monster			0
" evidence comes in a steady display of pictures and videos that seem oddly connected			0
the snapshot of a smiling woman lying in a field of bluebonnets			0
the image of a dead @entity10 strapped to the hood of an @entity71			1
a high school yearbook photo of a @entity74 football team			0
the diagram of a brain cell			0
video of a firefight shot from an insurgent perspective			0
the most unusual trial exhibit sits against the wall behind the prosecutor 's table : a small architectural mock - up of a home			0

a flat - topped square with a raised rectangular structure at the top providing access to the roof			0
it is beige in color			0
the tiny windows have tiny bars			0
it is a @entity97 map of a crime scene			0
earlier this month , a jury found @entity6 guilty of a raping a 14 - year - old girl who lived in the home in @entity10 , then killing her and setting her body on fire to destroy evidence			1
@entity6 also was found guilty of killing the girl 's parents and 6 - year - old sister			1
there is a casual manner to @entity6 's daily entrance into the courtroom			1
it defies the circumstances of the moment and the imagination without proper context			0
this is the sentencing phase of his death penalty trial and he is the defendant			1
testimony resumes monday , with the expectation of closing arguments as early as wednesday			1
@entity6 faces life in prison without the possibility of parole , or death in prison			1
the testimony transports the court to unusual places : across @entity74 following @entity6 's dysfunctional childhood , into the sense of structure and order of @entity138 basic training at @entity139 , @entity140 , and back to the chaos of horrendous combat situations four years ago in @entity10 's @entity143			1
@entity6 is a former member of the @entity144 , inserted into a very bad section of @entity10 during some of the worst fighting of the war			1

amid the military lingo , the witnesses pause occasionally , struggling to convey the contempt , confusion , exhaustion , and death they knew			1
they speak of being shot , of killings , booby traps and sudden bloody dismemberments			0
this toxic emotional mix is what former @entity170			0
@entity6 knew in 2005 and 2006 almost every day , along with the very real possibility of his own death			1
if the jury opts for its most extreme option -- the death penalty -- unlike his daily death watch in @entity10 , at least @entity6 will see that coming			1
when a friend or family member enters the courtroom , @entity6 tries to make anxious eye contact			1
he whispers a lot to his attorneys			0
his hands stay around his face and his gaze on the table when the victims ' family speak through an interpreter			1
the @entity192 ' relatives do not speak of details of the crime			0
the questions come only from the prosecution , and the defense does not cross-examine			0

they speak of a simple family who did not own either their home or the furniture			2
they speak of a funny 6 - year - old girl , @entity208 , being chased through the orchard trees by siblings			2
they speak of a 14 - year - old girl , @entity212 , with dreams of living in the city and wearing nice clothes			2
the jury never hears the words " rape " or " murder " come from the translation			1
it is a testimony about loss			0
the defendant sits rigid the entire time			0
the mention of other names comes frequently in court			2
spc. @entity227 : the jury knows him as the soldier who concocted a plan over a card game to target the @entity233 family -- a mission of gang - rape and murder			1
sgt. @entity237 : the defense counsel describes him as senior non-commissioned officer , the one who approved the mission as long as he was the first to rape @entity212			2
@entity237 : his name is familiar as the fourth member of the squad to leave their traffic checkpoint on march 12 , 2006 , after donning disguises , and enter the @entity233 home			0
@entity249 is the soldier left behind to guard their post			2
each is out of the @entity138 , sentenced to prison time by a military court for his part in the crime and the failed coverup			1
@entity6 , the trigger man , is the odd man out			1
he sits before the jury , convicted in civil court for this war atrocity			1
his early release from the @entity138 two months after the crime is a possible death sentence , while three of his accomplices face the possibility of parole from an @entity138 prison in 2016			1
@entity6 still sports a military haircut			1
seated at the table alongside his defense team , he often leans over and speaks with @entity272 , a former @entity273 captain turned @entity275 defense lawyer			0
there are letters on file in the court docket from @entity272 petitioning defense secretary @entity280 to re-enlist @entity6 in the @entity138 , so the former private could face trial under the @entity283			1
it is not unheard of in this war			0
@entity272 points out in conversation that the @entity287 re-activated two former @entity273 after word surfaced of an alleged murder in @entity290 in 2004			2
he says @entity6 should face a jury of his military peers			1
the fact that has not happened , and the former @entity138 private sits in the @entity295 of @entity275 tried under the @entity296 for crimes committed in @entity10 , may be a point of appeal			1
at the end of the day , @entity6 exits the courtroom , climbs back into his prison garb and is shackled			1
there 's another short walk to the car , then a five - block return drive to take in the world			0
he returns to solitary confinement			0
this is his human interaction for the day .			0
