-- when you 're dining at a revolving restaurant 250 feet above @entity3 , you expect the views to be fantastic			1
the real surprise is when the food appears -- and it 's excellent			1
what better way to savor a beautiful city than from this vantage point : a window seat at a revolving restaurant where the shifting views complement the gourmet courses			1
at @entity3 's @entity15 , that means pairings of just - caught mussels with a view of iconic @entity20 , spicy curry - butternut soup with the sandstone twelve @entity24 peaks , rack of lamb with beaches , and dessert with the sunset dipping below the @entity30			2
@entity0 : @entity32 's rudest people over the past 50 years , revolving restaurants have opened in more than 50 countries on six continents , from @entity36 to @entity37 to @entity38			1
along the way , the concept has gone from futuristic novelty to often - tacky tourist traps			2
but set aside that skepticism : we 've pinpointed select revolving restaurants that are worth the price of admission			1
the revolving restaurant trend took flight in 1961 , when @entity51 architect @entity50 built one on top of a shopping center in @entity55			1
a year later @entity50 was commissioned to design the @entity56 for the upcoming @entity57 in his hometown , and brought the idea with him			2
the resulting ultramodern tower not only became an enduring icon of this @entity64 city , it brought 20,000 awed visitors to the @entity56 restaurant each day of the @entity57 , setting off a global craze for revolving restaurants			1
far too many successors get by on their looks alone , serving generic , overpriced dishes that typically invite the harsh review : " killer views , mediocre food			2
" @entity75 's @entity77 rises above that revolving restaurant reputation and has become one of the city 's most coveted dining spots			1
it even earned a @entity84 star for chef @entity86 's concoctions , such as morel - crusted veal and langoustine tartare on a bed of caviar			2
@entity86 introduced airplane-esque classes of dining , from the @entity93 ( eight courses , including the caviar , for $ 209 ) to the @entity96 , a three - course prix fixe at a down - to - earth $ 52			2
that 's about as frugal as you get at these revolving restaurants , which each deliver a once - in - a - lifetime meal that ca n't be duplicated anywhere else			1
@entity0 : @entity57 's most beautiful subway stations @entity106 : @entity107 , @entity108 built above a geothermal spring , @entity106 serves a practical function -- storing the city 's water tanks -- and the indulgent one of fine dining in its giant glass dome			2
enter , and you 're greeted by sweeping views of the deep - blue ocean and volcanic mountains surrounding @entity107			2
get your fill of fresh local seafood such as sous vide smoked trout ( $ 20 ) and , in autumn , a special wild game buffet ( $ 73 ) of @entity108 delicacies like wild goose , reindeer , and puffin			2
heads up : @entity129 , a geyser right outside the restaurant , can provide quite the mealtime show , shooting white plumes of steam high into the air			1
@entity136 : @entity137 every glittering light of the @entity137 can be seen from this 844 - foot - high restaurant — the crown of the @entity136			1
the extravagant four - course tasting menu mixes classics such as lobster bisque and filet mignon with more inventive dishes like roasted miso @entity146 with shoyu ginger glaze , followed by crème brûlée and cheesecake lollipops			2
heads up : do n't be alarmed if you see a person propel past your window -- the new @entity156 thrill ride leaves from right above the restaurant			1
summit restaurant : @entity159 red carpets , pink - tinged lighting , and sleek lounge furniture create a sultry vibe within this dining room , which revolves past the @entity165 , @entity166 , and @entity167			1
@entity170 tv chef - lebrity @entity168 put local reef snapper and pan-fried quail breasts on the two - course dinner menu ( $ 89 )			2
for a more low - key meal , head to the @entity177 and pair an @entity170 craft beer like lord nelson old admiral @entity179 ( $ 10 ) with small bites such as deep - fried whitebait -- small and savory herring - like fish ( $ 16 )			0
heads up : on a clear day , you can see the lush @entity187 surrounding the city			0
@entity189 : @entity190 , @entity191 the world 's highest revolving restaurant is on top of a glacier 11,000 feet above sea level , reached by a remarkable alpine subway			1
a dozen of the highest peaks in the @entity200 slowly swirl by as diners warm up with hearty @entity191 - @entity203 fare like kalbsbratwurst ( veal sausage ) with hash - brown - like rösti ( $ 32 ) , and @entity206 : macaroni in a creamy cheese sauce with ham , bacon , potatoes , and stewed apples ( $ 32 )			1
if you 're still frostbitten , a glass of mulled glühwein wine ( $ 9 ) should do the trick			0
heads up : look southeast toward @entity217 ; if visibility is good , you can see as far as @entity220			0
restaurant 181 : @entity75 chef @entity86 's acclaimed restaurant inside the @entity223 was recently awarded its first @entity84 star			1
named for its placement 181 meters above ground , the restaurant has three airplane-esque options			1
in 181 @entity93 , the opulent eight - course tasting menu ( $ 209 ) starts with langoustine tartare on a bed of sevruga caviar ; 181 business offers à la carte dishes like morel - crusted veal ( $ 43 ) ; while the best value is 181 @entity237 , serving a three - course prix fixe ( $ 52 ) from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. heads up : do n't get lost in the long view of the @entity240 ; one of the city 's architectural triumphs , the canopied @entity244 inspired by @entity246 peaks , is directly below			0
@entity0 : @entity32 's most scenic roads @entity15 : @entity3 wedged in between the @entity30 and towering @entity20 -- with the new @entity249 to the north and posh @entity252 beaches to the south -- this dining room showcases @entity3 's main attractions in one gradual revolution			0
the menu , meanwhile , covers traditional @entity259 fare , dishes like ostrich carpaccio ( $ 7 ) and a salad of biltong ( beef jerky ) and goat cheese ( $ 7 ) , plus plenty of wine from the vineyards of nearby @entity269			0
heads up : @entity270 , the offshore prison where @entity271 was held for 18 years , is immediately to the north			1
@entity273 : @entity51 atop the @entity56 , in the space that ignited the revolving craze decades ago , @entity273 remains the best place for panoramic views of @entity51 , @entity278 , and snowcapped @entity279			1
fortunately , the menu is not stuck in the ' 60s			0
chef @entity281 puts creative twists on @entity64 classics , from @entity285 crab cakes with apple - fennel slaw and herbed aioli ( $ 13 ) to grilled wild king salmon with blueberry butter , wilted pea vines , and micro herbs ( $ 47 )			0
heads up : it 's hard to beat a multicolored sunset over the @entity294 across the sound			0
restaurant @entity296 : @entity297 , @entity298 a hundred miles north of @entity299 , this 550 - foot lakefront tower in quaint @entity297 is hardly a tourist trap ; its restaurant is consistently mentioned as one of the best in @entity298			1
local , seasonal ingredients such as just - picked morel mushrooms in spring or vendace roe from @entity308 ( right outside the windows ) in winter are incorporated throughout the menu			0
you 'll just have to trust that some items -- such as parfait of white chocolate with juice of sea buckthorn shrub ( $ 16 ) -- are more delicious than they sound			0
heads up : when the seasons change in october , the red - orange - yellow leaf - peeping here is as good as in @entity320			0
brasserie @entity321 : @entity323 , @entity324 down the coast from the glitzy resorts of the @entity328 , this quaint former fishing village lies on a strip of sand dunes that separates two saltwater lakes from the @entity146			0
atop an old water tower converted into a cultural center , @entity321 overlooks area lakes and beaches , while serving dishes that emphasize local bounty -- from mussels and oysters to shrimp and lobster -- to the mostly @entity328 vacationers			0
heads up : in spring and summer , the lagoon directly below the tower is often dotted with pink flamingos			0
the @entity345 at @entity346 : @entity347 it 's hard to know which way to look when @entity347 's skyscrapers are spinning by on one side and an array of master chefs are working at lightning speed in the giant stage kitchen on the other			0
the dinner buffet highlights fresh seafood from @entity347 's famed @entity359 , which you can request sautéed , grilled , steamed , or cooked tempura in front of you ( $ 108 )			0
additional stations prepare sushi and teppanyaki -- prime @entity368 beef grilled on a hot iron plate at your table			0
heads up : after dinner , head higher up to the 40th - floor bar for an even more impressive view of @entity374 and the @entity375			0
