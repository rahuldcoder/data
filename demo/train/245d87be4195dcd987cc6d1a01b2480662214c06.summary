-- @entity1 is a sport where tiny margins can be the difference between success and failure , so it is no surprise a small hole in @entity12 's @entity11 winning car has got rival teams reexamining the sport 's regulations			1
@entity16 clinched the @entity19 - owned manufacturer 's third consecutive win in the principality on sunday , but questions have been asked about the legality of @entity12 's @entity24 car			1
the debate centers around the floor of the car , specifically the area in front of the rear wheel			0
the @entity31 , the body which regulates the sport , states the floor of an @entity1 car must be impervious , a rule many teams presumed meant it must be free of holes			2
the official rule is as follows : " all parts lying on the reference and step planes , in addition to the transition between the two planes , must produce uniform , solid , hard , continuous , rigid ( no degree of freedom in relation to the body / chassis unit ) , impervious surfaces under all circumstances			0
" @entity16 wins @entity11 but the @entity24 's design , which has been cleared by @entity31 scrutineers and has been running since april 's @entity54 , features a rectangular slot in front of the rear wheel of the car			1
" in @entity62 there was much discussion about the legality of the @entity12 's floor , with speculation that rival teams were considering lodging post-race protests ( none ultimately did ) , " read a statement on the sport 's official website			1
" despite the fact that @entity12 have been running the design since @entity72 with the blessing of the @entity31 scrutineers			0
" the slot increases downforce at the rear of the vehicle by offsetting the negative impact the rear wheel has on airflow over the car			1
latest f1 standings after @entity11 and the @entity12 is not the only car to feature a modification aimed at tackling this problem			1
both the @entity88 and @entity89 cars feature slots in front of the rear wheel			2
but on both designs the slot it is placed at the edge of the body , rather than being an isolated hole in the floor			0
the design tweaks have clearly paid dividends			0
@entity12 currently lead the constructors ' championship , with its drivers @entity103 and @entity16 second and third respectively in the drivers ' standings , while @entity88 's two - time world champion @entity108 is top			2
with no team launching an official protest , the @entity24 , complete with slot , can be expected on the grid for the @entity113 @entity11 on june 10 .			0

the design of @entity12 's @entity24 car has been questioned by other teams
the @entity24 has a slot in front of the rear while which increases downforce
@entity88 and @entity89 also have design modifications aimed at tackling the problem
@entity1 's official website *confirms* no rival teams have *reported* @entity12
