-- " let me tell you a little about me			0
" " @entity7 " introduced himself to a @entity5 online community with these words in february 2005			1
" my name is umar but you can call me @entity18 , " the poster continues , detailing biographical information that appears to match the life of @entity11 , the 23 - year - old @entity12 man accused of attempting to detonate an explosive on an international flight into @entity14 , @entity15 , on christmas day			1
the failed terror plot put airports on high alert and refocused @entity23 attention on @entity24 , which claimed responsibility for the attempted attack			1
internet postings for @entity7 -- apparently a combination of his name and birth year -- reveal a young man who fought feelings of loneliness and struggled with balancing his life as a @entity5 with the temptations of the secular world around him			1
he wrote about his desire to attend university , possibly in the @entity23 , and his thoughts on love and marriage			2
officials have not confirmed that @entity46 postings by @entity7 were made by @entity11 , but the many detailed biographical points made by the poster match what has been reported about @entity11 's life			1
" i will describe myself as very ambitious and determined , especially in the deen , " @entity51 wrote in february 2005 , referring to the @entity53 way of life			1
the poster writes about being in boarding school , with possibilities of attending @entity59 or the @entity60			0
eventually , @entity11 studied mechanical engineering at @entity62			2
besides being ambitious , @entity7 also described himself as lonely			2
" first of all , i have no friend [ s ] , " he wrote in another online post with informal , imperfect grammar			0
" not because i do not socialise ( sic ) , etc but because either people do not want to get too close to me as they go partying and stuff while i do n't			0
or they are bad people who befriend me and influence me to do bad things			0
" i have no one to speak too , no one to consult , no one to support me and i feel depressed and lonely			1
i do not know what to do			0
" somewhere along the way , @entity11 turned toward @entity53 extremism			1
an @entity76 official said @entity11 was included in the @entity23 government 's @entity77 , or @entity79 , after his father warned the @entity81 in @entity12 of his son 's hard - line beliefs and possible ties to militant @entity53			1
but his name was not pulled from that database and included on lists barring him from @entity23 - bound aircraft			2
part of the explosive device that failed to take down last week 's flight from @entity94 , @entity95 , was sewn into @entity11 's underwear , authorities said			1
a preliminary @entity76 analysis found the device contained pentaerythritol tetranitrate , an explosive also known as @entity99			2
investigators were having trouble determining what the accelerant @entity11 allegedly tried to use to light the explosives because " the syringe was pretty much destroyed , " a law enforcement source told @entity2			2
all 300 passengers and crew onboard the @entity110 flight have been interviewed by authorities , the source said , adding that he expected no one else to be held or charged in connection with the incident			1
@entity7 's online posts show that as early as 2005 , he had a serious view of his religion			1
one of his struggles , the poster wrote , was that the " loneliness leads me to other problems			0
" @entity51 said after fasting , " i felt a shield that prevented evil thoughts coming into my head			0
i felt closer to @entity127			0
" being lonely awakened sexual desires that he struggled to control , he said , sometimes " leading to minor sinful activities like not lowering the gaze			0
" his religion instructed him to fast to avoid such temptation , but it did n't seem to be working , @entity51 said			0
in another online post soon afterward , though , he took his comment back			0
@entity2 's @entity135 and @entity2 homeland security correspondent @entity136 contributed to this report .			0
