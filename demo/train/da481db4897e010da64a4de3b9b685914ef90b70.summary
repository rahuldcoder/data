before the transcontinental race in " @entity2 , " the starter tells the gathered racers , " you all are certainly the most distinguished group of highway scofflaws and degenerates ever gathered together in one place			0
" @entity7 prefers the term " fraternity of lunatics			1
" where the 1981 @entity12 classic was a comedic twist on a race inspired by real - life rebellion over the mandated 55 - mph speed limits of the 1970s , @entity7 set out on a serious mission to beat the record for driving from @entity19 to @entity20			1
the mark ? @entity22 and @entity24 's cross-country record of 31 hours and 4 minutes , which they set in a modified @entity27 in 2006			1
@entity7 , a 28 - year - old @entity28 native , had long dreamed of racing from @entity30 to @entity31			1
a decade ago , for a high school assignment , @entity7 interviewed @entity33 , who conceived the @entity35 - to - @entity34 , aka the @entity2			1
@entity33 , who played the previously quoted organizer in the film he wrote himself , won the first @entity2 in the early 1970s with a time of 35 hours and 53 minutes			2
" i told him , ' one day i 'd like to beat your record , ' " @entity7 recalled			1
ounce of prevention it sounds like great outlaw fun -- and certainly , @entity44 added its embellishments , like the supremely confident , infidel - cursing sheik with a @entity47 and @entity48 in a priest getup -- but @entity7 said it took considerable research and groundwork			1
beginning in 2009 , about the time he started working for @entity53 , @entity7 researched cars , routes , moon phases , traffic patterns , equipment , gas mileage and modifications			2
he went into preparation mode about 18 months ago and chose a @entity62 with 115,000 miles for the journey			0
the @entity65 's gas tank was only 23 gallons , so he added two 22 - gallon tanks in the trunk , upping his range to about 800 miles			1
the spare tire had to go in the backseat with his spotter , @entity71 , a student at @entity72 , @entity73 's alma mater			0
to foil the police , he installed a switch to kill the rear lights and bought two laser jammers and three radar detectors			1
he commissioned a radar jammer , but it was n't finished in time for the trek			0
there was also a police scanner , two gps units and various chargers for smartphones and tablets -- not to mention snacks , iced coffee and a bedpan			2
by the time he tricked out the @entity65 , which included a $ 9,000 tuneup , " it was a real space station of a thing , " he said , describing the lights and screens strewn through the car 's cockpit			2
yet he still was n't done			0
" the hardest thing , quite honestly , was finding people crazy enough to do it with me , " he said			0
co-driver @entity101 , one of the @entity104 dealership 's customers , did n't sign on until three days before they left , and " support passenger " @entity71 did n't get involved until about 18 hours before the team left @entity28 for @entity107			1
if his difficulty finding a copilot was n't an omen , @entity107 would deliver one			0
while scouting routes out of the city , a gps unit told @entity73 to take a right on red , in the wrong direction down a one - way road			0
he was quickly pulled over			0
@entity7 got a warning -- and a healthy dose of relief that the officer did n't question the thick odor of fuel as he stood over the vents pumping fumes from the trunk			2
speed of sight : the world 's fastest blind daredevil record run begins the trio ignored what some might have considered a harbinger and the left the @entity136 31st street , the starting point for @entity138 , a few hours later			1
to be exact , they left october 19 at 9:55 p.m. , according to a tracking company whose officials asked not be identified because they were unaware that @entity7 would be driving so illegally when he hired them			1
they hit a patch of traffic in @entity19 that held them up for 15 minutes but soon had an average speed of about 90 mph			1
in @entity149 , they tapped the first of many scouts , one of @entity154 's acquaintances who drove the speed limit 150 to 200 miles ahead of the @entity156 and warned them of any police , construction or other problems			2
they blew through @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162 , hitting @entity163 before dawn			0
" everything possible went perfect , " @entity7 said , explaining they never got lost and rarely encountered traffic or construction delays			2
by the time they hit southern @entity172 , near the @entity174 border , they learned they were " on track to break the existing record if they averaged the speed limit for the rest of the trip , " he said			1
this was n't about doing speed limits			0
they kept humming west , and as they neared the @entity188 - @entity187 border , they calculated they might beat the 30 - hour mark , a sort of @entity193 in transcontinental racing that @entity7 likened to the 4 - minute mile			1
not one to settle , " we decided to break 29 , " @entity7 said			2
the unnamed tracking company says the @entity65 pulled into the @entity198 and @entity199 in @entity200 , @entity201 , at 11:46 p.m. on october 20 after driving 2,803 miles			1
the total time : 28 hours , 50 minutes and about 30 seconds			1
" most of the time , we were n't going insanely fast , " @entity7 said , not realizing his definition of " insanely " is a little different from most folks '			2
when they were moving , which , impressively , was all but 46 minutes of the trip , they were averaging around 100 mph			1
their total average was 98 mph , and their top speed was 158 mph , according to an onboard tracking device			1
" apart from a @entity218 truck not checking his mirrors before he tried to merge on top of me , we did n't really have any issues , " @entity7 said			2
do not try this at home he concedes his endeavor was a dangerous one , especially when you consider @entity7 slept only 40 minutes of the trip , and co-driver @entity101 slept an hour			1
but @entity7 went out of his way to make it as safe as possible , choosing a weekend day with clear weather and a full moon -- and routes , when possible , with little traffic or construction			2
" i had plenty of people at home praying i 'd make it safely , and , more importantly , had my wife praying that i would n't have to do it again , " he said , adding he has no children , which was also a factor			0
" that was one of the spurs to go ahead and get this over with			0
that 's probably the next adventure			0
" asked if the technological advances since the previous record holders made their run gave him an advantage , @entity7 replied , " absolutely			1
" because two teams broke the 32 - hour mark in 2006 and 2007 , he had a detailed " guide book " on how to do it , where they had to rely on word - of - mouth tales from the 1980s			0
" i thank @entity22 for that			0
we 're all adding chapters to the same story of @entity263 car culture , " @entity7 said			2
@entity22 did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment			0
@entity7 had hoped to revisit that high school interview and tell @entity33 he 'd followed through on that promise to break his record , but @entity33 now suffers from @entity269 's			1
" i 'll pay him a visit just for the sake of it , " @entity7 said , " but i ca n't tell him			0
" where the @entity2 scofflaws aimed to make a statement about personal freedom , @entity7 said he has the utmost respect for law enforcement			0
his goal was merely to " add myself and pay tribute to this chapter of automotive history , " he said			0
@entity73 also hopes that he shattered @entity22 's record by such a stark margin that it discourages would - be @entity287 from attempting to break his record , and it 's not just a matter of his own legacy , he said			0
" it really is n't something we need a whole band of lunatics doing , " he said			0
follow @entity295 on @entity296 : @ @entity297			0
