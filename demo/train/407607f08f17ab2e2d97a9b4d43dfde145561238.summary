-- which football team has the best record in one of @entity5 's elite leagues ? well it is n't @entity7 or @entity8 , @entity9 or @entity10 , or even one of the @entity13 giants			1
in fact , a 2 - 1 victory at the home of @entity17 champions @entity16 has put this particular side , who are virtually unknown outside their native country , on the verge of entering the record books			1
the " @entity31 " of @entity32 , the club that represents the city of the same name on the west bank of the @entity36 , will equal a @entity25 record of seven straight wins from the start of the season if they beat @entity30 this weekend			1
@entity32 are nicknamed the " @entity31 " for good reason			2
from november through to march , every year , the city plays host to the " @entity40 " a traditional carnival that places an emphasis on political and literary humor and commentary			0
it is an important and long - standing event in the @entity17 calendar and the football club has embraced the cultural significance that the carnival brings with it			1
@entity17 football expert @entity50 told @entity0 that @entity32 had risen to the summit of the @entity25 by creating a similar party atmosphere around the club			1
" the youth and exuberance of the side blends in perfectly with the party atmosphere that the city of @entity32 cultivates , " said @entity50			2
" @entity32 have always been known as the carnival club			2
the players have a close link with the fans and go and celebrate with them at the end of each game , win , lose or draw			0
" in the past they were just happy to be members of the @entity25 -- and that was worth a celebration in itself			2
but now with the success of this young team , some of the players have taken things one step further			0
" three of the players , @entity74 , @entity76 and @entity77 , have taken on the self - proclaimed title of the ' @entity79			0
' when anybody scores a goal they start playing imaginary musical instruments			0
one is the guitarist , one the drummer and also the singer			0
" it has become a big theme for the players and the team are riding the crest of a wave on the back of the atmosphere generated by coach @entity95 , himself only 37			1
" @entity97 is a coaching genius , he is just like ( @entity8 coach ) @entity99 -- but minus the ego , " added @entity50			0
that interaction with their supporters is another ingredient which sets @entity32 apart from the majority of their @entity25 rivals			1
@entity107 , a spokesman for the @entity32 supporters ' club , told @entity0 : " the atmosphere for home matches is unbelievable and i love the fact the profile of the team and the city has risen during this winning run			1
" for a long time there has been a great rapport between the fans and the players -- and the media have really picked up on the fact that the players like to party with the fans			0
" the image of @entity32 , both the team and the city , used to be of people and players not to be taken seriously			2
but now , with our current success , we are being seen in a different light			0
" and @entity32 's success on the pitch is now translating to an increased awareness of the city off the pitch			1
with the carnival just over a month away , the city is now suddenly on the front pages , as well as the back pages , of national newspapers			0
" we are starting to get more emails and queries about the carnival and the city , " @entity143 -- a press officer for the city of @entity145 -- told @entity0			0
" the team are now being viewed as being young , successful and good looking and that is a great image for the city to have , especially with the carnival almost upon us			0
" the people of @entity32 love to party and having the team making the headlines is the best advertisement the city can have			2
everybody in @entity17 is talking about @entity32 now			1
" and not just in @entity17 ; should @entity30 go the same way as @entity16 this weekend , the " @entity31 " will once again be making headlines across @entity5 .			1
