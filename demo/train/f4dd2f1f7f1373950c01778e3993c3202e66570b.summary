-- ahh , yes , february 15 , the joyful day when singletons can finally collapse in exhaustion after weeks of maintaining a nonchalant front			1
finally , you think , finally , the incessant stream of hearts and cupids and reminders that romantic partnership is the apogee of human achievement will come to a merciful end			2
and then you voluntarily read to the second paragraph of our weekly netiquette column , silly ! that 's right , we 're here to take you waist - deep into that cesspool of romantic endeavors and bad decisions : online dating			1
because if you survived yesterday single , you might be gunning to circumvent a repeat performance in 2013 ( i.e. , another year of you listening to @entity21 and sobbing softly in your bedroom or , conversely , having a faux - peppy who - needs - men night with your gal pals , swilling salmon - colored drinks and shooting hateful glances at the couples in the bar )			0
and if you 're in a relationship right now , do n't rest on your laurels quite yet : breakups spike right after @entity32 's big day , according to unofficial @entity34 data , so you just might be back on the market soon			1
we 've told you what not to do with your first message to a prospective date			1
we 've told you what not to do with your photo			0
yet real , live online daters continue to find bizarre and almost impressively original ways to turn us off			1
read on for three totally boneheaded online dating moves we 've actually encountered ( @entity44 , weird things no one warns you about when they 're persuading you to make a @entity48 profile )			1
watching you on the street " not to be creepy , but ... " began an actual first message from an actual online dater			1
" ... were you sitting on a bench at such - and - such intersection at about 6:15 last night ? i 'm not hitting on you , i just like to think of online dating as a city - wide game of @entity58			1
" yes , we were at said corner , and we were unaware we were being watched by a peeper on the street			0
the incredible thing is not that said dater recognized a human from the site -- in an urban area , where folks are bumbling around in their own overlapping circles , of course you 'll spot people whom you recognize from their profiles			0
the key is to not acknowledge it in a creepy way			1
( a clue that you 're not adhering to that guideline : you begin a message with , " not to be creepy , but ... " ) in this instance , for example , if the dude wanted to go on a date , he could send a friendly first message ( not mentioning the unwitting run - in )			1
then , if things were rolling along after a few dates , he could mention it in a fun , " you wo n't believe how serendipitous this was ! " kind of way			1
or if he could n't wait that long , he could send a cute @entity94 - style message : " i think i walked by you in @entity95 yesterday ! your purple peacoat was stunning			2
i see you 're a big fan of ' @entity97 ' -- have you checked out ' @entity98 ' ? " but just announcing , apropos of nothing , that he has superior facial recognition skills ? kind of weird			2
a friend told a tale of a girl he 'd been messaging who eventually stopped responding			0
a few weeks later , a new note in his inbox : " hey , were you at the @entity109 last night ? " ( indeed , he had been			0
without the benefit of knowing a girl was watching him like @entity113 in @entity114 )			0
if she was loving his vibes in person , she certainly could have walked up to him in between sets and said hello			0
but since she 'd already dropped the message volley like a hot potato , probably best to let sleeping dogs snore			0
another friend stopped messaging with a dude online when she got a weird feeling about him from his notes ; a few weeks later , he spotted her at a @entity128 restaurant and marched right in			2
with apparent disregard for all social mores , he sat down at the table with her friends and asked when they could plan a proper date			2
the recommended course of action here is obvious : since she had already rejected him online , he should 've respected that and let the girl and her friends finish their pad thai in peace			2
moral of these stories ? do n't be scary			2
online dating is nerve - racking enough when you 're all squirmy - scared of rejection and awkward first - date conversations			1
having to worry about weirdos jangling up to you at the supermarket ? not necessary			0
( oh , and if you 're the creep - ee : @entity154 ' em on the site , or if they 're approaching you in person , make an excuse and hightail it out of there			0
safety first ! ) revealing nothing about yourself it 's a strange power play , leaving your profile free from pictures and with only the pithiest write - ups ; it says , " you may need to advertise yourself like a heifer all gussied up for the state fair , but i ... i will make no attempt to sell myself to you			1
instead , " it tacitly blathers on , " i will decide whether you look interesting enough for me			0
" maybe that works for some people ( probably those seeking the weakest and most damaged goods )			0
our take : having an online dating profile and leaving it totally unpopulated just makes you look like you have no good qualities to trumpet			1
oh , and sending along a photo with your first message ? still silly			0
how come everyone else has to show their cards from the start , while you get to keep yours close to your chest ? it reeks of insecurity , a gross , musky smell reminiscent of @entity191 and tears			0
choosing a stupid user name a recent @entity195 study found that people with ugly names have less success on online dating sites			1
researchers came to that conclusion by tracking profile views on a gloriously @entity195 - looking dating site where users go by their real first names			2
but thank @entity206 you live in a country where you 're free to pick your @entity209 handle ! so why , why , why would you pick something ugly ( @entity211 ) or embarrassed sounding ( @entity212 ) ? there are so very many cards stacked against you in finding love ( see : a montage of your february 14 ) , so pick a simple username , write an honest profile , and pray to the good god @entity220 for better luck next year .			0

when encountering an online date *offline* , do n't be creepy about it
online daters should n't ignore safety and common sense , but should reveal some *basics*
there 's less success on online dating sites when using a poor user name
