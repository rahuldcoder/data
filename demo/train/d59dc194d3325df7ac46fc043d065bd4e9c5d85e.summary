-- " today i will fight again			2
this disease will not own me or define me			1
" these are the words i like to begin each day with , stating my intent out loud			1
somehow it seems if i actually hear it , it 's easier to live it and believe it			1
i have @entity11 's disease , for which there is no cure -- a disease that requires a daily personal battle with things most of us prefer not to discuss with others			1
and for those who must deal with it , one thing is certain			2
it 's horrible , it 's overwhelming , and it 's humiliating			1
the humiliation factor is a major reason so many suffer in silence -- the evidence of the disease and the treatments are things you just do n't tell others about			1
so you find yourself facing the challenges alone -- the pain that literally doubles you over without warning : nausea , life - threatening bowel obstructions , incontinence , dehydration , intravenous feeding , fatigue and depression			2
there is also the ever - present threat of surgery , ostomies and permanent damage to my body			2
there are long days without any food or water , followed by multiple days of clear liquids only			2
doctors : a new era in @entity11 's disease each person suffering from the disease will have their own private hell made up of variations of these components , but all will share the guarantee of loss of normal life , and the knowledge that there is no cure			1
during my worst times it 's been so tough that , exhausted from battling the pain , frustration and fear , i 've cried myself to sleep on the bathroom floor			1
there are many , many drugs and some forms of chemotherapy treatments that may bring about remission in @entity11 's cases but no guarantees			1
and even with remission , the fear and questions linger -- will it come back ? every healthy day is a blessing that carries a black cloud on the horizon			1
there is relief as you realize you have a reprieve from the disease but a lingering sense of anxiety as you contemplate the " what if " that hangs just above your head , depriving you of real peace			1
it 's a daily struggle to keep the fear and uncertainty at bay and enjoy the moments that feel " normal			1
" so i will focus just on today			2
teen diagnoses her @entity11 's disease in science class i rise early so i can exercise -- exercise helps battle the fatigue that , because of an inability to absorb nutrition from food , is the out - of - control demon affecting each day			1
i dress for work , pack my small meals and snacks from the very short list of things that i can easily digest			0
others will see the confinements of my diet as depressing , but for me they are delicacies that are far preferable to the too - often - required clear liquid diet			0
the freedom to consume real food , and to do so by mouth instead of through a tube , is a gift i treasure at each meal , and that i never take for granted			0
saying blessings before my meals has taken on a new meaning as i give thanks and pray that some nourishment will be retained as my food speeds through my system			0
this is important to prevent dehydration and / or artificial feeding			0
next , i fill my pill divider with the 13 doses of six medications i will take that day , almost hourly			1
four times a month , i 'll give myself a scheduled injection of vitamin @entity150			0
monthly injections from a caregiver are part of the drill twice a month , but if today is not one of those days , i 'm good to go			0
there will be no spontaneity to my day			1
a sudden , last - minute invitation to lunch will be met with " i 'd love to , but i already have plans , " a small white lie that keeps me from having to explain			0
an invite to dinner , drinks , a movie or shopping will be met with a similar excuse			0
trying not to appear anti-social while repeatedly declining all invitations has resulted in a neat little list of interchangeable excuses			0
even a meeting will require advance notice and preparation if it takes place around a meal			0
menus must be reviewed in advance , and medication dosages slightly altered			0
and more often than not , even with all this preparation it will just turn out to be " a bad day " and a last - minute cancellation will be unavoidable			1
occasionally this happens around events that are really important to me , such as a wedding or a family member 's funeral			1
missing these events brings frustration , anger and eventually leaves me in tears			0
but acceptance will finally come as i make peace with what i know ca n't be changed			0
so most days , it 's easier to just give in and have no plans			1
i can replace the anxiety of " what happens if " with the comfort and security of home , where my safe foods , medicine , supplies and a comfortable resting place all reside			2
i need the downtime and the extra rest , because tomorrow i 'll do it all again			0
my battle closely resembles the battle fought by those with colon cancer			0
suffering from @entity11 's disease can mean debilitating pain , fistula surgery and diarrhea that can be so severe it can bring on dehydration			1
like colon cancer , remission is possible , but recurrence is probable			2
like colon cancer , a variety of medications and treatments can help with the effects , but they are strong medications that bring their own set of problems and risks			0
while @entity11 's disease itself is not terminal , the complications often result in death			1
keeping it under control requires a real commitment to fight and a resolve to sustain that commitment every day			2
the motivation to fight is the strong desire to not suffer , and deviation often results in serious illness			2
each surgery or flare - up leaves me with a little bigger battle to face , so i keep fighting			0
and yet i do feel lucky -- lucky to be alive and grateful to be in the midst of a season of fewer struggles			2
i am blessed , and i truly understand that in the big scheme of things this struggle is but a moment			0
and in this season of reprieve			0
i carry the cold knowledge that there are more than 1 million other people suffering like me			0
so few people understand this disease , yet it 's part of the lives of so many people all around them			1
i hope to help change that			0
i tell my story only to help bring a little attention to what life is like for those who battle @entity11 's -- because sharing equals attention , and attention equals awareness			1
and awareness builds hope that something can be done -- maybe not in my lifetime , but perhaps in my children 's			2
that 's important because the probability of my children being diagnosed increased the day i was diagnosed			1
so today , i share			0
and today i will fight again , with every intention of winning			0
@entity11 's diagnosis means lifelong battle			1

@entity11 's disease is " horrible , it 's *overwheming* and it 's humiliating , " @entity285 says
many with @entity11 's suffer in silence , @entity290 says
even in remission , fear and anxiety linger , she says
@entity290 says she 's learned to be grateful for each day in remission
