beach bums beware : 10 % of water samples collected from @entity4 beaches failed to meet the government benchmark for swimmer safety , according to a new report			1
it 's an icky thought , especially considering the popularity of several of the failing beaches included in the @entity12 's 24th annual " @entity13 " report			1
beach choices matter : the @entity4 @entity15 estimates up to 3.5 million people become ill from poor water treatment each year , largely because of contact with " raw sewage from sanitary overflows			1
" " @entity24 and contaminated runoff in the water should never ruin a family beach trip , " said @entity12 senior attorney @entity21 in a statement			1
" but no matter where you live , urban slobber and other pollution can seriously compromise the water quality at your favorite beach and make your family sick			1
" so which beaches are " superstars " and which are " repeat offenders " ? here 's the good , the bad and the ugly			1
the good at 4 % , the eastern coastline comprised of beaches in @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 boasts the lowest failure rate of beach water samples in the country			1
all samples were tested against the new @entity15 water quality standard , called the " @entity50			1
" for individual states , @entity42 , @entity51 and @entity52 tied for the top marks , each with a 3 % failure rate			1
additionally , the @entity12 selected 35 beaches as " superstars " -- meaning popular spots that consistently meet water quality safety thresholds			1
these locations spanned 14 states and showed at least a 98 % water safety record over five years : -- @entity64 : @entity65 in @entity66 , @entity67 in @entity66 , @entity68			1
-- @entity69 : @entity70 in @entity71 ( one of three monitored sections )			2

-- @entity120 : @entity142 , @entity143 in @entity144			0
the bad the new " @entity50 " resulted in a significant increase in failure rates in 2013 , especially in certain states			0
the @entity149 had the highest rate of beach water impurities , with 13 % of all samples failing to pass safety standards			1
the region was also home to the worst individual state offender , @entity157 , which posted a 35 % failure rate			1
next closest states were @entity160 and @entity161 , with 24 % and 21 % failure , respectively			2
under the old , less - stringent standard , 7 % to 8 % of beaches failed to meet water quality standards			1
this year , the number jumped to 10 %			1
the report detailed the disastrous effects swimming in infected waters could have			2
" @entity68 water pollution nationwide causes a range of waterborne illnesses in swimmers including stomach flu , skin rashes , pinkeye , ear , nose and throat problems , dysentery , hepatitis ... and other serious health problems , " it said			2
" for senior citizens , small children and people with weak immune systems , the results can even be fatal			0
" the ugly some beaches just do n't get the hint			2
over the past five years of analyzing over 3,500 beach water samples , the @entity12 has identified 17 @entity4 beaches that have " consistent contamination problems			1
" to qualify for this " repeat offender " list , a beach has failed to meet public standards for water quality more than 25 % of the time since 2009 -- a dubious distinction			1
here they are : -- @entity69 : @entity202 , 50 yards east of the pier , in @entity204 -- @entity205 : @entity206 in @entity207 ( both monitored sections ) : @entity209 , @entity210 -- @entity95 : @entity211 in @entity212			0
-- @entity213 : @entity214 in @entity215			0
-- @entity51 : @entity216 in @entity135			0

-- @entity232 : @entity233 in @entity234			0
what you can do strictly swimming in " superstar " beaches would be a plus , but the @entity12 has other recommendations on how to remain safe in troubled waters			2
here are two suggestions : -- " stay away from beaches with visible discharge pipes and avoid swimming at urban beaches after a heavy rainfall			2
" -- " a good rule of thumb is to avoid swimming at the beach for at least 24 hours after it rains and 72 hours after heavy rains			0
