-- it 's never easy when you get that phone call , even when you 've known for years that it might be coming			1
but on friday , i got the call that someone i loved had died			2
just five days earlier , my friend @entity8 and i had been making plans for our kids to go trick - or - treating together , and now she 's gone			2
i ca n't write that @entity13 lost her battle with brain cancer , because @entity8 hated that phrase			1
her husband , @entity17 , thinks she just did n't like the concept of losing at anything			2
actually , in my book , she beat cancer			1
her disease was diagnosed when she was 43 , when her son @entity23 was 3 years old			1
her doctor told her that statistically speaking , she had three to six months to live			2
that was in february 2007			2
she beat cancer not just in the length of the time she survived , but in how she lived these last 4Â½ years			1
as the cancer invaded @entity8 's brain and the chemotherapy poisoned her body , her spirit remained clean			1
she never expressed anger to me that she got cancer at such a young age and with such a young child , even though she certainly would have been entitled to			1
it 's not that @entity8 sugar - coated her illness : @entity17 remembers she was scared when she got the diagnosis , and she talked to me and her other friends about the brain surgeries and the awful side effects of the chemo			0
but @entity8 lived full speed ahead until she could n't live anymore			1
she knew cancer would ultimately end her life , but she did n't let it ruin the life she had left			1
" she was such a happy , positive person , " @entity17 told me after her death			0
" she just wanted to enjoy every minute she had left			0
she never wanted to talk about ' what happens if i die			0
' " instead , @entity8 planned for life			0
she 'd always wanted to visit all 50 states , and so over the past four years , she and @entity17 and @entity23 visited the states she had n't been to yet			1
she wanted to see @entity59 and @entity60 , too , and the three of them took trips there			0
when a teenage family member needed her help , she took him into her home , since helping family and friends meant everything to her			0
@entity8 taught me so much about living , and so much about being a smart patient			2
she was one of the first people i wrote about when i started the @entity74 column shortly after her diagnosis , and our frequent discussions about doctors and hospitals and treatments and choices have informed my writing since			1
@entity8 was the ultimate empowered patient , as she diagnosed her own cancer			1
when her cancer was first diagnosed , doctors told @entity8 she had leiomyosarcoma , a particularly rare and aggressive form of cancer			1
a licensed practical nurse , @entity8 looked up the diagnosis online and called to tell me that something sounded strange -- she had the leiomyosarcoma only in her brain and nowhere else , and such leiomyosarcoma cases are so rare , they get written up in medical journals			0
plus , people with leiomyosarcoma often have had diseases like @entity96 , or have had lots of radiation earlier in life			2
her oncologist wanted @entity8 to start chemo right away , but she refused			0
instead , she and @entity17 flew to a hospital in @entity103 that specialized in sarcomas , where they confirmed she did n't have leiomyosarcoma , but rather a much more common type of tumor , a glioblastoma multiforme			0
if @entity8 had simply accepted her first diagnosis , she would have received the wrong treatment and most likely would have died quite quickly			0
she lived for 4Â½ years -- she lived to see her son 's seventh birthday -- because she was smart and she trusted her gut , the most important part of being an empowered patient			1
@entity8 was in her kitchen the last time i visited her , surrounded by @entity17 , @entity23 , her mother , and aunts , uncles , cousins and friends			0
the weekends at her house were like that , as she sustained a community for herself , her husband and son			0
i 'd never seen a house so full of life in the face of death , but that 's because @entity8 embraced all that was good no matter what horrible things lay ahead .			0

@entity13 was one of the first people featured in this column
the ultimate empowered patient , she diagnosed her own cancer
