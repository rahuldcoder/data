-- the @entity2 team took to the field for its clash against @entity5 with these words inscribed on its jersey patches : " the @entity2 will to win is stronger than any opponent in your way			1
" for 94 minutes on sunday , they persevered			0
they were down , then they equalized , then they led			0
but , with mere seconds to go , @entity18 's dogged determination was torpedoed by a header from @entity21			1
what seemed like a sure win ended in a disappointing 2 - 2 draw			2
" a draw is just blah , " @entity2 goalie @entity25 said			2
now , the @entity2 team will have to find steelier resolve for its next contest , against soccer powerhouse @entity29 on thursday			1
a lot rides on that game , if the @entity2 wants to advance to the next round			1
but before we get to that , let 's look back at the drama and emotion of sunday 's spectacle			0
cheers , then silence from @entity41 to @entity42 , @entity2 fans had flocked to @entity43			2
some made it all the way to the jungle heat of @entity48 where the game took place ; others joined a crowd of about 20,000 people gathered in front of a big screen in @entity56 , chanting their belief in an @entity2 victory			1
back at home , bars and streets were packed with people -- an unusual sight in a country that is ordinarily indifferent to soccer			0
" what 's for dinner ? @entity5 , " an oft - repeated joke went			1
@entity5 netted the ball first			2
if one were to go by history , that would have been disastrous			0
in 20 games , the @entity2 has never recovered when the opposing team scored the first goal			2
but then , @entity76 thumped in a stunning long - range shot to bring the score to 1 - 1			0
and when @entity81 put the @entity2 ahead 2 - 1 , cheers erupted even on a flight from @entity83 to @entity84			2
all the @entity2 had to do next was bide time -- keep possession of the ball , keep an increasingly desperate @entity5 at bay			1
they did -- until the end of the game and for four of the five minutes of stoppage time			0
but @entity21 's crushing late equalizer -- headed in from a pinpoint cross by @entity5 's talisman , @entity95 -- stunned the @entity2 supporters			1
but shock soon turned to grudging satisfaction			0
a tie is n't as bad as a defeat			2
after all , @entity5 is ranked no. 4 in the world ; the @entity2 no. 13			1
a tie also gives another point for the @entity2 , moving it closer to qualifying for the knockout stages			1
' you have to move on ' the team captain certainly was n't dwelling on the @entity5 game 's cruel finale			1
" you 're disappointed not to get three points but at the same time you have to take the positives from the game , " @entity81 said			0
the team now has its sights set firmly on @entity29			2
that confrontation is an intriguing one for @entity2 coach @entity116 , who played for the @entity118 team that won the @entity119 in 1990			2
but he did n't show any conflicted loyalties in his comments sunday			0
" we have one day less to recover			0
they played yesterday , we played today , " he told @entity123			0
" we played in the @entity125 , and they played in the very kind of location where they do n't have to travel much			0
everything was done for the big favorites to go and move on			0
we have to do it the tough way , but we 're going to do it the tough way			0
" win or tie enough the key question for @entity2 fans is what their team has to do to get through to the next round			1
the good news is that the @entity2 players have their fate in their own hands : a win or a tie would be enough to see them through			1
a victory against @entity29 on thursday , unlikely but not impossible , would put the @entity2 top of the group with seven points			1
a tie would also be good enough to qualify , leaving @entity18 second on five points , level with @entity29 , which would finish top because of a better goal difference			1
... but a loss ? in the event of a @entity118 win , things get a lot more complicated , but not necessarily catastrophic for the @entity2			2
if @entity5 and @entity161 tie , the @entity2 would stay in second place on four points			1
( @entity5 and @entity161 only have one point each at the moment			1
) if @entity95 leads @entity5 to victory , it would pull level with the @entity2			1
at that point , it would all depend on goal difference			0
the @entity2 currently have scored one more goal than they have conceded			2
the @entity171 , meanwhile , have let in four more goals than they 've scored			0
@entity5 would need a big victory or an especially heavy @entity2 defeat to tip the goal difference to their advantage			1
' we have to make it ' if @entity161 beats @entity5 , the margins are a lot slimmer			1
@entity161 currently has a negative goal difference of just one			0
so if @entity161 wins by more than one goal , and the @entity2 loses by one or more goals , @entity161 would snatch second place			1
it 's all complicated math. but @entity116 appears determined to make sure there is n't a need for it			0
" so we did n't make it quite yet , " he told @entity123			0
" we have to make it against @entity29			0
" @entity119 5 things : you 'll need two screens today @entity0 's @entity194 contributed to this report .			0

@entity18 faces @entity29 in the final group game on thursday
a win or a tie would be enough to take the @entity2 to the knockout stages
a defeat would mean the team 's fate rests on the result of the @entity5 - @entity161 game
