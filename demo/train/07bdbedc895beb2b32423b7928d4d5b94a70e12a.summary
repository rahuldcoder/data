-- @entity1 announced today that her new album , due march 15 , is titled " @entity3 " -- but the superstar singer and her @entity6 producers are still choosing songs and determining the final direction of the overall sound			1
" it 's not done , " dr. @entity15 , co-producing the album with longtime @entity1 collaborator @entity11 and @entity13 dance - pop songwriter @entity14 , tells @entity0			1
" we 're in the middle of it right now			2
it 's a little bit fluid right now			0
i ca n't even say at this stage what songs for sure are making it and what songs are n't			2
we 're working with a lot of producers and overseeing it with her a&r and record label and management and trying to make something cohesive			2
" @entity0 : @entity1 ' life in photos the album , of course , will contain " @entity37 , " co-written by dr. @entity15 , @entity11 and @entity38 , the hot songwriter who penned @entity40 's " @entity39 " and @entity42 ' " @entity41			1
" @entity1 ' new single made its debut on the pop charts in mid-january at no. 1 , before dropping to no. 6 last week			1
originally , dr. @entity15 and @entity11 , the @entity47 songwriter behind some of @entity1 ' biggest hits , including " ... @entity51 , " planned to give the song to @entity40			1
" we might have played it for her , but it definitely was n't a @entity40 record , " dr. @entity15 says by phone from @entity53 in @entity6			0
" we had it for a while			0
i wanted to make sure it did n't sound like everything else i 've done			0
i brought it into @entity14 , and he just killed it			0
it can be hard in the verse , and the bridge is super , super hard , but the chorus is super- pop. you can play that chorus acoustically on a guitar and it 's still going to sound great			0
" @entity0 : @entity75 's four - star review of " @entity37 " @entity77 radio stations continue to spin " @entity37 " in regular rotation			1
" it feels like a really obvious , easy - to - listen - to first single , " says @entity80 , program director for @entity81 in @entity6 , which played the song once an hour the first day it came out			0
" you hear all those little parts that are so @entity1 -- ' here 's the video - breakdown - dance part of the song			1
' that 's what my listeners love about her			0
" although her 2008 album @entity97 sold fewer than 2 million copies , not a huge number given @entity1 ' history of blockbuster sales , retailers have high hopes for the march release			1
" [ @entity97 ] ended up doing well , but we were a little cautious about it -- a little tense comeback issues were going to be relevant , " says @entity106 , music buyer for @entity108 , who predicts the new album could sell 500,000 copies in its first week			2
" but this time around , her stock is higher			0
" @entity0 : @entity1 lets loose for the cameras dr. @entity15 also noted that he and @entity11 , the executive producers , plan on working on several songs directly in addition to " @entity37			1
" he also confirmed @entity121 ( who co-produced @entity1 ' classic " @entity123 " ) and @entity124 ( who worked on ke $ ha 's " @entity125 " and @entity127 's " @entity39 " ) were among several big names who would make production appearances			1
so far , @entity1 has dropped by the @entity6 studio two or three times to lay down her vocals			2
" @entity1 's really fast , " dr. @entity15 says			2
" she gets it done			0
