-- the other day i saw a death metal band hanging out by their tour van in the parking lot behind a club			1
they were all dressed in black , and may or may not have been working on lyrics to a new song about fire and lamb meat			1
" what rhymes with ' charred remains ? ' " now , i ca n't say for certain that they were actually death metal			1
but that 's what i 'm going with			1
admittedly , i 'm not very up to date on the various sub-genres of growling into a microphone			1
thus , when i do n't know any better , i find it 's always best to make assumptions			1
for instance , this morning i assumed i wore pants to work			1
the people in line at @entity27 assumed differently			2
but there they were , this supposed death metal band , all dressed in black , minding their own business on a lovely sunny afternoon in @entity32			1
and i just stared at them with intrigue until i uttered the most old - man thing i 've ever uttered : " they 'd be so much happier if they just wore a little color			2
" which is a completely insane thing to think			2
they were probably loads of happy			2
and they seemed perfectly reasonable			2
in fact , maybe they were discussing how , if they pooled all their collective happiness and reason , they could open up a combination orphanage and puppy day care center called @entity50			1
shame on me for judging			2
just because they wear all black and their music probably sounds like a horse choking on a watermelon does n't mean they 're angry people who eat children and worship @entity58			2
besides , that 's so @entity61			2
the point is , they have their thing			2
and just because i do n't understand or particularly enjoy death metal , does n't mean it 's not good music and , dare i say ... art. because art is exactly what was being celebrated recently in @entity72 when a local death metal band called @entity74 decided to lock themselves in an airtight , soundproof cube and play until they ran out of oxygen			1
the plan is to do it three nights a week , wednesday through friday , at 6 p.m. throughout the month of july			0
or at least until they all forget the safe word and suffocate			0
" i ... should 've ... gone ... to law school			0
" the actual cube was designed by a @entity85 artist named @entity86 , and he calls it " @entity87			1
" but what does it all mean ? interestingly , the death metal art cube sits right outside the famous @entity72 office building known as " the @entity92			1
" that 's the one that looks like a giant suppository in the heart of the @entity97			0
and the cube is supposed to represent the cold , dark working spaces within the surrounding office buildings			1
@entity86 says , " in this corporate architecture you do n't really see what 's going on inside			1
the same happens here in the work			0
you see it but , then again , you do n't see it when the performance starts			0
" look , i only barely get this			0
i now have five functioning brain cells , and i 'm not prepared to burn four of them trying to digest all the deep meaning from a weird public art display			1
so , i trust that whatever @entity86 says makes sense			0
i 'm more interested in the music			0
or , i suppose , the lack thereof			0
being that the box is airtight and soundproof , all the music is completely inaudible to the public			1
they can only feel it			0
which is actually kind of cool			0
presumably , though , inside the box it sounds like your grandfather passing a kidney stone the size of a @entity132			1
but only for a short while			0
@entity134 , the band 's lead vocalist , explained , " we did 14 minutes the first time on the run through			1
and then we did 19 minutes today			0
" so , it 's kind of like musical @entity139 , except this box is actually ... a box			0
and you do n't have to tell your @entity144 friends about the sand bag you just lifted over your head			0
but , hopefully , as the month carries on , @entity74 will keep playing for longer and longer			1
this , despite the fact that it does n't look very pleasurable			0
really , they 'd be so much happier if they just wore a little color			0
