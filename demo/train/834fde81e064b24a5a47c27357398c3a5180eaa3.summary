-- @entity2 experiments , known as @entity3 , were first implemented in 1999 , when a computer with an internet connection was embedded into a wall for children to discover and use unsupervised			1
the wall adjoined a slum in @entity9			2
only a month later , it was evident that the children had taught themselves to use the computer and also picked up some skills in @entity12 and mathematics			2
this kind of design was then set up in more and more remote areas across the nation with almost identical results			1
these were computers embedded in walls or kiosks in easily accessible and highly visible public spaces , facilitating peer interaction , discovery and learning in groups of children			1
we concluded that groups of children from disadvantaged and remote settings can learn to use computers and access internet resources , on their own , if given appropriate free , public and unsupervised access			1
watch an interview with @entity34 these earliest experiences also showed that children could develop some skills in @entity12 and mathematics			1
what came through unequivocally in this and further work on self - organizing systems in education was that groups of children -- irrespective of who or where they are , or what language they speak -- given free and public access to computers and the internet can : 1			1
become computer - literate on their own -- that is , they can learn to use computers and the internet for most of the tasks done by lay users			1
teach themselves enough @entity12 to use e-mail , chat and search engines			1
learn in a few months to search the internet for answers to questions			2
improve their @entity12 pronunciation on their own			0
improve their mathematics and science scores in school			0
be prepared to pass examinations several years ahead of grade level			0
change their social interaction skills and value systems			0
form independent opinions and detect indoctrination			0
we then went on to show that the quality of traditional schooling declines the farther schools are from the urban center of @entity84			1
a similar decline is visible in the @entity86 as one goes to more economically disadvantaged areas			0
this has been attributed to the lack of teachers willing to work in these areas			0
@entity92 : @entity93 on mosquitoes , malaria and education two landmark events took this work further			0
the first was a comment by the late sir @entity101 to me : " teachers that can be replaced by a machine should be "			0
the second was an experiment in a @entity109 - hit @entity9 village , where i was trying to prove that @entity111 - speaking 12 - year - olds can not teach themselves biotechnology in @entity12			1
at the end of the experiment , a little girl told me , " apart from the fact that improper replication of the dna molecule causes genetic disease , we have understood nothing else			0
" finally , we found that the presence of a friendly , but not knowledgeable , mediator can enable children to reach levels of learning similar to formal schools with trained teachers			1
@entity92 : @entity127 says schools kill creativity we went on to set up a " cloud " of " @entity131 , " mostly retired schoolteachers with broadband access from their homes			0
schools can access this " cloud " over @entity135 and children can interact with the mediators over free videoconferencing			2
interestingly , in the hands of good teachers , these methods can be powerful motivators for children , resulting in better performance			0
what started out as a solution for remote areas turned out to have universal applicability			0
both @entity3 and the work done later are based on the concept of @entity151 , a pedagogic method that motivates groups of children to learn in an environment with little or no intervention from teachers or other adults , and that formed the basis of the design of the ' @entity3 ' computers			2
it is now possible to formulate a new approach to learning , using these findings			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity34 .			1

@entity34 : experiments show **students** can teach themselves with computers
he says **students** showed *remarkable* *progress* by working in teams
adult mediators can help further this kind of learning even without formal teacher training , he says
