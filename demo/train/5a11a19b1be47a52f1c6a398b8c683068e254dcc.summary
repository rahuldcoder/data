-- @entity1 is free to return to @entity2 in 2013 after reaching an out of court settlement with the sport 's governing body , @entity5			1
@entity1 , former team principal at @entity7 , was originally banned for life by the @entity5 after allegations he was involved in a conspiracy in which @entity11 deliberately crashed at the @entity12 in order to help team - mate @entity15 win			1
in january , @entity1 succeeded in getting his ban overturned in a @entity18 court , saying the ruling had restored his " dignity and freedom			1
" the court also overturned the lifetime ban imposed on former @entity7 engineering director @entity23 for the same incident			1
but the @entity5 launched an appeal against the decision , before an announcement that they had settled their case with @entity1 out of court			2
@entity1 agreed to recognize " his share of responsibility for the deliberate crash , " according to @entity5 but insisted he accepted no personal guilt for the incident			0
an @entity5 statement read : " after discussions between their lawyers and those of the @entity5 , mr @entity1 and mr @entity23 have each made a settlement offer to the @entity5 president with a view to putting an immediate end to the legal proceedings			2
" each of them recognizing his share of responsibility for the deliberate crash involving the driver @entity11 at the 2008 @entity12 of @entity48 , as " @entity52 " of @entity7 where mr @entity1 is concerned , they have expressed their regrets and presented their apologies to the @entity5			1
" they have undertaken to abstain from having any operational role in @entity2 until 31 december 2012 , as well as in all the other competitions registered on the @entity5 calendars until the end of the 2011 sporting season			0
" they have also abandoned all publicity and financial measures resulting from the judgment of 5 january 2010 , as well as any further action against the @entity5 on the subject of this affair			0
" the @entity5 president has considered that it is in the best interests of the @entity5 not to allow the perpetuation of these legal disputes , which have received a great deal of media coverage and which , regardless of the outcome , are very prejudicial to the image of the @entity5 and of motor sport , and thus to accept this settlement solution , thereby putting an end to this affair			0
" the @entity48 incident came to light after @entity11 was sacked and then went public with his admission of involvement			0
@entity1 issued his own statement to the official @entity2 web site stating that he recognized his share of responsibility " without any admission of a personal guilt in these events and without any recognition of the fact that the decision of the @entity91 rendered against him would have been well - founded			0
