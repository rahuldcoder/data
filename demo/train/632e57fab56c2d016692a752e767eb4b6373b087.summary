-- leaders from @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 appeared together friday to hail an agreement that saves the province 's power - sharing government			1
the leader of the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) called it a " good day " for the province , and @entity2 prime minister @entity10 said it opened a " new chapter " for @entity4			1
" let it be said in times to come that after decades of violence , years of talks , weeks of stalemate , this is the day we secured the future , a lasting peace , power being where it should be -- in the hands of the people of @entity4 , the strongest answer to those who would bring violence back to our streets , " @entity10 said			1
@entity32 secretary of state @entity31 also praised the accord , calling it " another important step toward a full and lasting peace			1
" the @entity32 is prepared to help " build upon their efforts by promoting a new spirit of cooperation among all parties , " she told reporters			0
@entity44 and the @entity9 , the two largest political parties in the province , have been in a bitter political standoff for months over police powers and how to devolve them , or bring them under local control			2
they held 10 days of talks before reaching an agreement thursday			1
@entity10 and @entity3 prime minister @entity53 flew in last week for emergency talks with the parties when it seemed the negotiations might fail			2
had no agreement been reached , it could have brought the collapse of the @entity61 -- the legislature -- and forced new elections			0
because the power - sharing deal set up by the @entity66 in 1998 is fragile , there were fears that new elections might imperil the peace process			1
" people across @entity4 feared that if the political process failed , they stood to lose all that had been achieved over these last few years , " @entity10 said			2
" but what we have found in our talks is that , while the purpose of the discussions was an agreement on police and justice , what has emerged is more than that -- a new spirit of cooperation and mutual respect			0
" @entity10 said the devolution of policing and justice powers will happen april 12			0
in addition , the @entity2 government has agreed to finance that devolution by making 800 million pounds ( $ 1.26 billion ) available , @entity10 said			1
earlier , @entity44 party leader @entity91 called the deal a " wonderful chance " for @entity4 to move forward			2
" today presents us , i think , with another new beginning , " he told reporters			0
the @entity97 @entity44 has favored devolution , and @entity91 said it always seemed " a bit ridiculous " that the @entity61 was not allowed to legislate on issues affecting its own people			0
the agreement reached thursday with the @entity104 @entity9 will help @entity4 take " more and more possession of our own affairs , " he said			1
" there will be begrudgers , but those that have been driving this need to go forward and forget about what happened for the last year or so , and see this as a genuine ' an tus nua , ' a new beginning , " @entity91 said , using @entity108			0
@entity9 leader @entity117 also said the agreement secures a positive future for @entity4			2
" no future generation would forgive us for squandering the peace that has been so long fought for , " @entity117 said			0
" no sane person wants to go back to the carnage , instability , violence ... that we have endured over recent generations			0
