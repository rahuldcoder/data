" i was a little bit nervous in the start " , the 30 - year - old said in an interview with the @entity21 website			1
" i thought i skied really well on friday , but it was tough conditions and i was n't able to be on top of the podium			2
today was kind of the same , the snow was soft but at least it was sunny			2
i just tried to keep my feet underneath me and not to push the skis against the snow too much and it worked out			2

but for me , mentally , it was the same as any other race			2
now i 'm happy we can stop talking about it			0
" although few will actually stop talking about it			0
@entity0 now has the chance to hold the record outright , with 63 wins , in monday 's super- @entity65 " i 've surprised myself how far i come , " @entity0 told @entity2 after her victory			1

i want to win as many races as possible			2
i have a lot more to give the sport			0
" the was one last question to ask : had she spoken to her boyfriend , @entity75 ? " yeah i talked to him and he said he 's really proud of me , " she confirmed			0
" he was watching with his daughter early in the morning			0
i was sad he was n't here but he 's training			0
