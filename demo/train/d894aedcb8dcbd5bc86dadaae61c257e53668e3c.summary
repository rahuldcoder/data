-- in the frenzy over the sudden phenomenal success of @entity4 -- known as " @entity5 " -- there 's been some talk of race			1
@entity8 , the famed boxer , caused controversy when he said the other day , " @entity4 is a good player but all the hype is because he 's @entity11			1
black players do what he does every night and do n't get the same praise			0
" before you get up in arms about @entity8 's comment , first consider the source			2
@entity8 is known for causing a stir and pushing people 's buttons			1
he 's made homophobic and racist comments about sports figures in the past , including champion boxer @entity24			0
so anything @entity8 says you might want to ignore			1
but does he have a valid point ? is @entity4 getting this much attention only because he 's @entity11 ? absolutely not			1
does race play into the equation ? absolutely			0
@entity4 is the first @entity31 to not just get on the court but make a major impact in the @entity34			1
no one since the @entity34 - @entity38 merger during the 1976 - 77 season has scored at least 20 points and seven assists in his first five starts			1
almost single - handedly , @entity4 has given new life to the once proud @entity46 franchise			1
yes , there have been other @entity48 and @entity11 who played in the league , but most were of mixed race ( @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 )			2
we had the star @entity55 for a while , but he was from @entity57			0
he can even dance the @entity60			0
not all @entity48 are alike			0
no one thought much of @entity4 until he was given a real chance			2
the @entity46 were reportedly set to waive @entity4 but gave him the opportunity to play because of a lack of depth at point guard			2
@entity4 was on the @entity71 last season before getting waived on the first day of training camp and then was briefly with the @entity74 before being let go			2
now , there were financial situations involved like salary cap , guaranteed contracts , etc. , but there is no doubt in my mind that because @entity4 is @entity11 , it made it easier for management to overlook his potential			1
@entity4 has benefited from playing in @entity86 -- the media capital of the world -- but his emergence to stardom is due to his talent , his faith and his determination			2
has race been on people 's minds ? yes			2
you stick out on the court when you 're the only @entity11 face			2
while there are @entity11 playing in the @entity100 and @entity101 , the @entity34 is different			1
maybe i 'm guilty of stereotyping as well , but this is a game dominated by black athletes like @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107			0
if a @entity31 - @entity109 guy can hold his own against the best athletes in the world , wow ! @entity4 has also struck a chord among @entity11 - @entity109 men			1
i have heard many negative stereotypes over the years			0
we are n't tall enough , sexy enough , strong enough or good - looking enough			0
these stereotypes are still portrayed in our culture today			0
just take a look at the @entity11 male character on the tv show " @entity120 , " or read the crude sexual tweet by the sports columnist @entity122			0
i have faced my own share of stereotypes as a rare @entity31 - @entity109 television sportscaster			1
( i believe i was the first in the country			0
) really , not since @entity128 displayed his power in " @entity130 " have we @entity11 - @entity109 men had someone to rally around			1
@entity4 has given us a sense of pride			0
so @entity8 is right , race does play a part -- but @entity4 is no token minority			1
the man has game or he would n't be getting the attention he deserves			0
i do n't know if he 'll have a long career or be an all - star , but you can be sure he is starting to change not just the way general managers and pro scouts look at @entity11 playing sports , but also the way our society thinks about them			1
join the conversation on @entity154			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity157 .			0

boxer @entity8 said the @entity4 mania is because @entity4 is @entity11
@entity157 : while @entity4 is talented , race is a factor that people ca n't ignore
@entity157 : @entity4 is the first @entity31 to make a major impact in the @entity34
he says that @entity4 has given @entity11 - @entity109 men someone to feel proud of and rally around
