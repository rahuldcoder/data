@entity0 , @entity1 -- way back in 1888 , @entity3 popularized the hobby of snapshot photography with its famous slogan : " you press the button , we do the rest			0
" @entity13 paper is is dry , waterproof , smudge - proof , tear - proof , peel - off , sticky - backed -- and recyclable			1
now , 120 years later , @entity13 says : " just add paper " and do it yourself			1
@entity13 is a zero - ink printing company that has updated the instant gratification that comes from developing pictures for the digital age			1
the pleasure of snapping a picture and admiring the print has n't changed , but the technology has , plus there is a new eco-friendly element			2
@entity13 paper is an advanced composite material with embedded yellow , magenta and cyan dye crystals that change color when heated			1
for a 2 " x3 " print , a @entity13 - enabled printer uses 200 million heat pulses to activate and colorize 100 billion crystals , in 30 seconds , in a single pass			1
the final result is a photographically correct print that is not only completely dry , but also waterproof , smudge - proof , tear - proof , peel - off and sticky - backed -- not to mention recyclable			2
if @entity13 's thermal printing process sounds familiar , it differs from @entity45 ( dye diffusion thermal transfer ) , or dye sublimation technology , used by other companies such as @entity3 , @entity48 or @entity49 , in one crucial aspect -- @entity13 involves zero ink			1
" the source of heat conveyed to the printer head is similar , " says @entity52 , one of @entity13 's original inventors and present chief technology officer			1
" the advantage with @entity13 is that there is no need for an ink ribbon			1
the heat is applied directly to the paper			0
there are no gears , no motors , no mechanism is required to manage the ink ribbon			2
all the information is in the paper			0
" inkless footprint so not only is @entity13 compact , it 's ecological			2
because there is no ink , there are no empty ink - ribbon cartridges and no extra packaging to dispose of			1
" the paper is the print , " concludes @entity52			0
" printers can be the smallest footprint of any printing technology			0
" as the company 's first consumer application to hit the market , the @entity13 - enabled @entity83 is only slightly bigger than an @entity87 , weighs 230 grams , uses a rechargeable lithium - ion battery , and connects to a mobile phone via wireless bluetooth or to a digital camera through a usb cable			1
the pocket printer will be available later this summer in the @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 , and will sell for about $ 150 , while @entity13 paper will be sold in packs of 10 or 30 , at 33 - 40 cents per sheet			1
with sales of camera phones and digital cameras growing exponentially , one can easily speculate about hundreds of billions of digital photos being snapped and " trapped " on memory cards and hard drives around the world			0
but hold on a nanosec -- why print to paper at all when we inhabit the global digisphere ? you know you want to " our research shows that in this digital age , more than ever , people still have a deep - rooted need to see , feel , mark , share or use their digital images or information in a physical form , " remarks @entity116 , @entity13 's chief marketing officer			1
" we know there 's a pent - up need to print , " confides @entity52 , a 30 - year @entity83 veteran			0
" even though not everyone wants to print every image , there is still a real customer need to be able to print on - the - go , whenever you want , wirelessly , from portable devices			0
" so far , @entity13 has partnered with @entity83 and manufacturer @entity133 to produce the @entity83 , and with toy - maker @entity134 and manufacturer @entity136 for an upcoming product			2
in addition , @entity13 has produced its own not - yet - released 6 - megapixel digital camera - printer			1
if the combo - device does n't appeal immediately to all die - hard digerati , it might be more likely to win over @entity144 nostalgics , or anyone keen on wallet - sized snaps and @entity149 - style " purikura " photo - sticker booths			0
commemorating those @entity3 moments twenty - five - year - old student @entity151 enjoys printing out those special shots for her scrapbook or making collages for friends , and she is happy to pick them up from the self - service kiosk after a short wait			0
" i like to physically hold the prints and look at them in my hands , " she says			0
" you appreciate a photo more when it 's not on the computer			0
it 's one that you 've taken the trouble to print , maybe even frame , so you pay more attention			0
" if one person 's print is that same person 's carbon footprint , most people seem to agree that printing remains an inalienable delight			2
@entity177 , of the @entity179 express kiosk in @entity0 , confirms : " about half of the people out there prefer to view their pictures printed , rather than on a computer			0
but all people like to see real photos			0
all our customers print photos for friends and family , never for business ... if they do n't want to print , then we close			1
" whether instant or not , at least now zero - ink provides us with an environment - friendly alternative to satisfy our pent - up printing desires .			2

@entity13 technology is a thermal printing process on paper that involves zero ink
because it uses no ink - ribbon cartridge , it is *ultra-compact* and ecological
more than ever in the digital age , people feel *compelled* to print their photos
