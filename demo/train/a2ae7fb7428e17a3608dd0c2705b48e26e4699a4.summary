the @entity1 jackpot is juicy , but thanks to new , longer odds , it 's entirely possible the payout could reach $ 1 billion by @entity5			1
nope , that was n't a typo -- " b " as in " boy			0
" when no winner was selected in friday 's drawing , the jackpot rolled over to $ 550 million , and it jumped again monday to $ 586 million , with a cash payout of $ 316.5 million , said @entity14 , a spokeswoman for the @entity15			1
the total could easily increase again before tuesday night 's drawing			2
if you 're wondering how this stacks up against past prizes , it 's the second - largest @entity1 payout ever after the $ 656 million kitty collected in april 2012			2
here is a look at the top five jackpots in history , according to lottery officials : no. 1 -- in march 2012 , lottery officials announced three winning tickets for the $ 656 million @entity1 jackpot were sold in @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 ; no. 2 -- a @entity37 woman won the $ 590.5 million @entity39 jackpot in may ; no. 3 -- the $ 587.5 million @entity39 jackpot was collected in november 2012 by a man in @entity41 and a couple in @entity43 ; no. 4 -- a $ 448.4 million @entity39 jackpot was split by two winners in @entity46 and one in @entity48 in august ; no. 5 -- a single winner in @entity50 won the $ 399.4 million jackpot in september			1
so , the real question is : what are the chances of winning ? well , as @entity56 reported last week , you have a much , much better chance of being killed by an asteroid			0
and while those are long odds , they 're even longer than they were in early october			1
that 's because on october 22 , @entity1 made it more difficult to take home the big prize			0
the odds , which were 1 in 176 million , are now 1 in 259 million			1
this is a product of the lottery company increasing the pool of numbers to choose from			2
previously , lottery players chose five numbers , ranging from one to 56			0
it 's now one to 75 , but the sixth , gold ball has fewer numbers from which to choose , as the pool decreased from 46 to 15			2
how many people have won since the new rules went into effect ? zero			0
and if that trend continues , lottery players could see their first 10 - digit jackpot just in time for the holiday season			0
if nobody wins tuesday night , the jackpot for friday 's drawing will begin at $ 800 million , said @entity86 with the @entity87			1
why you keep playing the lottery sudden lottery fortunes not always for the best			0

jackpot rises to $ 586 million and could jump again before tuesday
if no winner is selected by @entity5 , the pot could reach $ 1 billion
odds got longer in october when the company increased the pool of numbers
