-- @entity1 opened his seventh @entity7 in suburban @entity8 earlier this month as the latest in a long line of celebrities who 've tried to sell a meal with their a- , b - or c - list name			2
many celebrities invest in restaurants -- @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , to name a few -- they just do n't always put their name above the door			1
the celebrity moniker can be both a blessing and a curse when it comes to starting a restaurant			2
for every @entity22 -- which at one point boasted 350 franchises -- there is a @entity26 's @entity25 , @entity26 's @entity27 or @entity26 's @entity28 them ? neither does anyone else			2
" there 's definitely value in a popular celebrity 's name , " @entity31 , author of " @entity32 , " tells @entity0			1
" so if someone is well - liked by the fans , seeing the celebrity 's name above the door of a restaurant just might make you go in			1
" the eponymous celebrity restaurant has its roots at the beginning of the @entity48 movie industry			2
in the 1920s and ' 30s , stars such as @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 lent their names to eateries			2
" it " girl @entity56 was so famous , she called her restaurant simply " it caf√©			0
" " most people did n't have to be told who the ' it ' girl was , " @entity31 says			0
and just like today , scandal could destroy a celebrity 's restaurant			1
@entity68 's @entity67 crashed and burned along with his acting career following allegations of rape and murder by the portly comedian			0
he " was eventually acquitted , but not in time to save his career , " @entity31 says			0
in those early days , the star who had his or her name on the menu was often in the joint , available to sit and have a drink with other famous pals			0
by the 1950s and ' 60s , though , celebrity restaurants became more business ventures than vanity vehicles			1
@entity85 licensed his name for @entity87 on the @entity88			0
" @entity90 ' names were slapped up on signs but they were rarely seen in those establishments and it was simply the name value that they hoped would draw in that celebrity 's fans or tourists who hoped to see other celebrities there , " @entity31 says			1
then there are those celebrities who 've extended their time in the limelight with an eatery			0
the skipper from " @entity106 " greeted guests at @entity109 's @entity108 and @entity110 , and vaudevillian @entity112 's chili recipe launched his career as a restaurateur in @entity115 , @entity31 says			1
the allure continues to reel in diners , hungry for a star sighting , be it fans of @entity1 or @entity121			0
" sometimes it 's just the thrill of grabbing that ashtray , that book of matches , " @entity31 says			0
" and is n't it more fun to go back to @entity128 and say i ate at [ so - and - so 's ] restaurant instead of saying i ate at an @entity131 restaurant ? it just gives it a little more oomph			1

celebrities and restaurants are a good business *mix*
stars like @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 invest in restaurants
others put their names on restaurant , like @entity146 's @entity110
