-- " the @entity5 joins the government of @entity4 in strongly condemning the murder of @entity8 , who was killed in a drive - by shooting monday morning , " read a press release issued december 12 by the @entity2 and distributed by the @entity3 in @entity4			1
" the @entity5 will continue to stand side - by - side with women who are carrying on @entity8 's fight , the @entity4 government and all @entity4 people to ensure that the hard - won gains made by women in the recent years are protected and advanced			1
" yet as the 2014 deadline for withdrawal of @entity20 forces approaches many @entity4 and some @entity5 wonder how , exactly , those gains will be safeguarded			1
and @entity8 's death , along with three other killings of @entity4 women in the past several weeks , shows both the gains and potential losses facing women in @entity4			1
on a recent monday morning , gunmen opened fire on @entity8 while she walked to her office in broad daylight in eastern @entity32			0
she was the acting head of the region 's women 's affairs department , which meant that she handled everything from helping abused women get to shelters to overseeing regional economic empowerment programs			1
her title was " acting " because , as @entity4 's @entity42 reported , only five months earlier her predecessor , @entity41 , was killed in a car bomb blast that also left her husband in a coma			1
both @entity8 and @entity41 are among the hundreds of @entity4 officials and leaders who have been targeted for assassination			2
the killings of the @entity4 officials come alongside several weeks in which horrific cases of violence against women came to light in the @entity4 press			1
in @entity59 province , a 16 - year - old schoolgirl named @entity57 was shot dead after leaving the @entity60			0
days later @entity4 women leaders gathered in @entity62 to demand justice and a government investigation into whether the @entity65 , which are suspected in the killing , were responsible			1
some activists saw a link between @entity57 's killing and her work volunteering for a polio eradication campaign the @entity65 are known to oppose			2
in @entity73 province , 2012 has been the " most violent on record for women and girls , " with more than a dozen killed			2
most recently , a 14 - year - old was killed by a gunman as she opened her door , allegedly in connection to a failed marriage proposal			0
another schoolgirl , @entity82 , was found slain , her throat slit in what appeared to be retribution for her father 's refusal to agree to her marriage			0
the girl 's killing came while she was on her way to collect water for her home near the @entity96 border			2
one of the men the police detained in the investigation was her thwarted suitor			0
this collage of horrific violence against women tells two stories			2
first , for @entity4 officials , death is a frighteningly present possibility at all times , and women serving other women are among the leading targets			1
a slew of high - profile female leaders have been killed , from @entity115 of @entity117 's police force to @entity118 , who headed @entity117 's local ministry of women 's affairs office , the same position @entity41 and @entity8 held in @entity32			1
and second , as a @entity122 official in @entity4 noted this month , while violence against women remains " largely under - reported due to cultural restraints , social norms and taboos , " the last year saw " an actual increase in reporting of incidents of violence against women , " with prosecutors and courts " convicting more perpetrators for such crimes			1
" certainly the high - visibility horrors that " reach law enforcement , that actually get to the court , or receive public attention due to their egregious nature represent only the tip of the iceberg " when it comes to crimes against women in @entity4 , but the fact is that more women are bringing their abuse to the authorities and a thriving @entity4 media are picking up their stories			2
this reality points to progress , say advocates for women			0
and they say they are coming to believe that these steps forward will not recede as the international troops withdraw			0
" i do n't see that @entity4 can go backwards , " says @entity159 of @entity160 , an organization that runs shelters for abused women across the country			2
" too many people have experienced and felt the freedom of how it is to live in a safe environment			0
i really do n't think the young people will ever go backwards			0
" certainly the years since 2001 have been marked by dramatic changes for @entity4 women			1
nearly 3 million girls are in school , and more than 3,000 midwives across the country save expectant mothers ' lives			0
women make up a quarter of parliament , and civil society -- groups pushing for human rights and better education -- is filled with 20 - , 30 - and 40 - something women pushing for their rights and their country 's future			2
in many ways the stories of these women are part of a larger narrative the @entity5 public , exhausted by the country 's longest - ever war , has nearly stopped hearing : some women are making great progress -- and taking great risks -- while some others have seen their lives change little and continue to be plagued by violence and deadly abuse			1
as three prominent @entity4 women entrepreneurs who appeared in @entity206 at the @entity207 this month made clear , the gains of some women lead to the gains of more			1
homegrown role models help show what is possible to the girls of the next generation -- and their fathers			0
in the political sphere they show that women can lead and they stand up for girls such as @entity82			0
and in the economic realm these entrepreneurs are creating jobs for women and men in a country that has an unemployment rate estimated to top 35 %			0
as these women push forward they bring others with them and bolster families ' prospects in the process			0
but their advancement takes time			0
in @entity5 's recent election , neither side wanted to discuss in any depth either the stakes of the @entity4 conflict or a sustainable future strategy for the war			1
poll after poll shows @entity5 no longer think it is a war worth fighting			2
but @entity4 women are still in the fight and will be long after 2014			1
and their battle for a more educated , richer , healthier country is one in which everyone has a stake			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity250 .			0

acting head of women 's affairs department in @entity4 province was gunned down
@entity250 says the killing fits a pattern of violence against women
she says women have made strides in @entity4 since 2001 , but huge issues remain
@entity250 : while @entity5 *focuses* on withdrawal , much remains at stake for @entity4 women
