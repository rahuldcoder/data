-- even though the @entity1 has become a key tool for accessing services , getting an education , finding jobs , getting the news , keeping up with people you know and much more , one in five @entity10 adults still does not use the internet at all , according to a new @entity13 report			1
why ? mostly they 're just not interested -- not in the @entity15 , e-mail , @entity17 , @entity18 or anything else that happens online			0
" among current non-internet users , almost half ( 48 % ) say the main reason they do n't go online now is because they do n't think the internet is relevant to them -- often saying they do n't want to use the internet and do n't need to use it to get the information they want or conduct the communication they want , " said the report			1
the respondents ' next-most common reasons were that they do n't have a computer or that it 's too expensive , too difficult , or a waste of time			1
most @entity40 who do n't currently go online have never gone online before -- and no one else in their household uses the @entity1			2
just over 20 % of non-users say they know enough about technology to start going online if they wanted to , and only 10 % said they 're interested in using the internet or e-mail in the future			2
who are these neo-luddites ? mostly they 're older -- 59 % of @entity10 seniors do n't go online			1
also , nearly 60 % of @entity10 adults who never completed high school do n't use the @entity1			1
and they 're mostly poor -- nearly 40 % of people with an annual household income under $ 30,000 do n't go online			2
( @entity13 notes that people with an annual household income under $ 20,000 are especially unlikely to use the @entity1			2
) people with disabilities also are more likely to not use the @entity1			0
one - quarter of @entity10 adults live with a disability that interferes with activities of daily life -- and only 54 % of these people are @entity1 users , @entity13 found			1
but in terms of ethnicity , the @entity10 digital divide has narrowed			0
according to @entity13 : " the internet access gap closest to disappearing is that between whites and minorities			2
differences in access persist , especially in terms of adults who have high - speed broadband at home , but they have become significantly less prominent over the years -- and have disappeared entirely when other demographic factors ( including language proficiency ) are controlled for			2
" having broadband access at home is one of the best ways to get the most benefits ( or at least the most use ) from the web -- and @entity13 found that right now 40 % of @entity10 adults do n't have broadband at home			1
in fact , after @entity10 home broadband penetration peaked in may 2010 to cover 66 % of @entity10 adults , in the past year there 's been a slight decline			1
as of august 2011 , only 62 % of @entity10 adults had broadband at home -- a 4 % drop			1
the people who lack home broadband access are -- not surprisingly -- from the same demographics as people who do n't go online at all : mostly older , with lower educational attainment and income , or living with a disability			1
the racial aspect of the home broadband gap has narrowed , but not vanished			0
according to @entity13 : " by 2010 , while national home broadband adoption had slowed , growth in broadband adoption among @entity40 jumped well above the national average , with 22 % broadband adoption growth since the previous year			0
even with these gains , however , minorities are still less likely than whites to have home broadband overall			0
and foreign - born and @entity116 - dominant @entity115 trail not only whites but also native and @entity119 - speaking @entity115			0
" mobile devices are making a dent in the @entity10 digital divide			0
" groups that have traditionally been on the other side of the digital divide in basic internet access are now using wireless connections to go online , " said the report			1
" among smartphone owners , young adults , minorities , those with no college experience , and those with lower household income levels are more likely than other groups to say that their phone is their main source of internet access			1
" many of these " cell mostly " users have other ways to get online , such as a desktop or laptop computer			0
however , a third of these people do n't have home broadband -- and their smartphone is the main way they access the internet			2
mobile devices also tend to make people more avid internet users			0
" once someone has a wireless device , she becomes much more active in how she uses the internet -- not just with wireless connectivity , but also with wired devices , " said @entity13			0
" the same holds true for the impact of wireless connections and people 's interest in using the internet to connect with others			0
these mobile users go online not just to find information but to share what they find and even create new content much more than they did before			0

almost 48 % say they do n't go online because they do n't think the @entity1 is relevant to them
nearly 60 % of @entity10 adults who never completed high school do n't use the internet
having broadband internet access is the best way to get the most use out of the web
a common reason why people *shy* away is they think it 's a waste of time
