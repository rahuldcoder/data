-- a man boards a plane in @entity3 with a slight fever			1
as the jet nears an airport in @entity9 , his temperature rises ; his throat grows sore			2
it 's the flu , he thinks after he lands , but he 's wrong			2
he 's caught the deadly ebola virus			1
he soon dies of hemorrhagic fever while surrounded by family			1
some of them catch it , and it 's like a flame hitting a fuse			2
the @entity21 erupts in its first @entity23 pandemic as health care workers fight an uphill battle to contain it			1
could what sounds like the plot of a @entity29 pestilence thriller really happen here ? well , yes and no. yes , @entity23 can come to the @entity21			1
but no , there 's no reason to panic			0
" this is not an epidemic ; it 's not the kind of disease that can sweep through @entity9 , " said dr. @entity33 of @entity34			1
what is the risk of catching @entity23 on a plane ? the ' yes ' part : given that international air travel is commonplace , it 's realistic that an infected passenger could land in the country			2
@entity49 , a @entity21 citizen working in @entity3 , fell violently ill while on a plane to @entity52 this month			1
he was planning on returning to his family in @entity54 but died before he could			2
" it 's going to happen at some point , " @entity0 chief medical correspondent dr. @entity55 said			0
a person can be infected and not show symptoms for up to three weeks			2
so it 's possible for someone to fly to the @entity21 who has the virus but is feeling fine			1
" just observing the whole process , it 's almost impossible to prevent from happening , " @entity55 said			0
then , the person could develop symptoms of ebola hemorrhagic fever , which would make the patient capable of passing the virus			1
to catch it , one has to come into contact with a sick person 's bodily fluids : sweat , saliva , blood or excrement			0
the ' no ' part : experts agree that the disease would not spread far like it has in @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity3 , where health officials believe it has killed more than 700 people in the largest @entity23 outbreak in recorded history			1
there are two reasons for this : â € ¢ @entity23 is aggressively infectious , which means that those infected are highly likely to get sick , it 's not very contagious , meaning that it does n't spread easily			2
â € ¢ public health educators and medical professionals in the @entity21 and other highly industrialized countries would deal with it swiftly			1
it 's an advantage the poor affected countries in @entity99 do n't have			1
" it certainly is feasible that someone could come to the @entity21 who is infected and gets sick here			1
no one 's denying that , " said dr. @entity104 of the @entity105			0
but the health care system in the @entity21 gives it the ability " to do the kind of isolation that apparently is very difficult to do within the health care infrastructure in the @entity114 countries that we are talking about			1
" the ' why not ' part : to answer that , consider the following : 1			0
that 's one of the big advantages that industrialized nations , such as the @entity21 , have in fighting @entity123 's spread			1
first , teach health care workers to recognize @entity23 cases			0
then keep people out of contact with their bodily fluids while it runs its course			2
the @entity132 has alerted health workers in the @entity21 to keep an eye out for symptomatic patients who have recently traveled to @entity99			1
if a case does turn up , public health officials will work to rapidly track down other people the patient has come into contact with and screen them for the virus			2
they are currently looking for anyone who may have come into contact with @entity49			0
there 's little superstition surrounding @entity23 here			0
" epidemics of disease are often followed by epidemics of fear and epidemics of stigma , " said dr. @entity146 of the @entity132			0
" all these kinds of things occur in a social context that can make containment very , very challenging			0
" in many parts of @entity99 , rumors have spread that eating raw onions will protect from the disease while mangoes may promote it , the @entity157 has said			1
villagers carry out their usual burial of the dead , coming into contact with bodily fluids and infecting themselves			0
with too few people to mount a tough battle against the spread of the disease itself , aid workers have said they are putting a lot of emphasis on education			2
they are teaching local residents to stay out of contact with the virus while they treat the sick			0
but locals often view them with suspicion , some accusing them of bringing the disease to the country			0
there 's ready access to basic care			0
" we do n't have a vaccine , and we do n't have any drugs that work on it at the moment , " @entity33 said			0
" the treatment is entirely what we call supportive care			0
" much of the treatment involves simple nursing , things such as proper hydration and nutrition			0
in places where aid workers in @entity99 have done so , they have been able to save about 45 % of those infected			1
without treatment , the death rate can run as high as 90 % , @entity202 has said			0
a pretty good way not to catch the virus is not to come into unprotected contact with sick patients			0
that 's why @entity23 caregivers dress in head - to - toe protective gear with masks and patients are isolated in tent - like structures , making it look like the scene of a chemical spill			0
how the @entity21 and the @entity99 can help is to devote money and staff to contain the virus in @entity99			1
" we 're not doing a brilliant job of containing the epidemic in terms of the resources we 've devoted to it so far , " @entity33 said			2
ebola outbreak cripples @entity99 , threatens beyond deadliest - ever outbreak : what you need to know ebola doctor in @entity82 dies @entity0 's @entity233 contributed to this report .			1

a man eventually headed for the @entity21 died of ebola hemorrhagic fever in @entity52
had he arrived , he could have infected others
but an epidemic outbreak in the @entity21 would be unlikely
in @entity99 , the largest outbreak in recorded history has killed more than 700 people
