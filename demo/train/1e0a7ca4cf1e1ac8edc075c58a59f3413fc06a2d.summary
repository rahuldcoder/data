-- in a televised address monday night , @entity2 president @entity1 explained the reasons he involved the @entity2 military in the @entity7 - authorized mission in @entity8 , saying " it was not in our national interest " to let the citizens of a rebel stronghold suffer a massacre at the hands of approaching pro-government forces			1
@entity1 also said that @entity17 would take full control of the military mission on wednesday			1
following is a collection of reactions from people including @entity2 politicians and political analysts			2
@entity2 sen. @entity25 , @entity26 : " i think that the first part of his speech was excellent , and he laid out the reasons why it was important to intervene and what would have happened in @entity34			1
... he made a strong case			2
" " then ... he made a very puzzling comment , and that was ( regime change by force ) would be a mistake			1
@entity42 must have been comforted by that			0
" " the president 's policy is @entity42 must go			1
i think there 's a chance , if we keep the pressure on , @entity42 could be thrown under the bus ( by people surrounding him			2
) " " it 's clear we 're on the side of the rebels in this conflict			2
... ( but ) if we tell @entity42 , ' do n't worry , you 're not going to be removed by force , ' i think that 's very encouraging for @entity42			2
" @entity59 , host of @entity0 's " @entity60 " : " it was actually an important speech			1
it was quite carefully constructed			0
it had a humanitarian angle , a strategic angle			2
but at the heart of what @entity1 is saying is that there are places in the world where the @entity2 does not have vital national interests , where we have not been attacked , but we have limited interests and we 're going to try to find a way to have some kind of limited military response			1
" " what @entity25 was suggesting ( in the reaction above ) frankly strikes me as a very dangerous argument -- that in a place where we have clearly limited interests , clearly nonvital interests , the @entity2 and the president should ( have ) an open - ended policy of military escalation and say we will do whatever it takes to get @entity42 out of office			1
that is , frankly , the way we got in conflicts like @entity91			0
in order to not be humiliated , we could n't back down			2
" @entity93 , spokesman for @entity95 speaker @entity94 , @entity96 : " the speech failed to provide @entity2 much clarity to our involvement in @entity8			1
nine days into this military intervention , @entity2 still have no answer to the fundamental question : what does success in @entity8 look like ? " @entity2 sen. @entity105 , @entity107 - @entity106 : " i thought he did a good job talking about the signal we would send , that we are a values - based people , and stranding by these young people in @entity8 will serve us well in the future			1
but the line that really sort of broke my heart was that regime change by force would be a mistake			1
the goal of this country is to replace @entity42			0
if you look at the balance sheet of what it costs this nation with @entity42 versus what it costs without him , it is in our interest to get rid of him , and the opposition needs continued military support -- not a ground invasion by the @entity2 or any other western power , but air support -- all the way to @entity136			1
" " if we continue the model we have in place ... ( the rebels ) will win			0
if we back off , this thing is going to go on for a long time , and a lot of people will die unnecessarily			0
" @entity143 , former @entity8 ambassador to the @entity2 : " i think it is a great speech			1
the president was very clear and very determined , and defended his position in a nice way , and i think he convinced the @entity2 people			1
" " the @entity2 , they proved to the world they will not only intervene if there ( are ) @entity2 interests only , but ... also when human life is in danger			2
this is a historical decision			0
... we really appreciate what @entity2 did for the @entity8 people			2
the @entity8 people ... deserve a better government			0
" @entity160 , former @entity161 mayor : " the president 's speech tonight has made things even murkier than they were before			1
the whole purpose of this was to clarify our mission			2
our mission is just internally contradictory			0
the president says our mission is to protect the people of @entity8			2
well , how do you protect the people of @entity8 and not be for regime change in @entity8 ? is n't the danger to the people of @entity175 ? " " the president 's speech is illogical			1
if you were grading this on a @entity180 logic exam , you 'd give it an @entity182 the speech contradicts itself			2
it says limited action ; we 're not going to go any further than just protecting the people of @entity8 ; we 're not going to be for regime change			1
but you ca n't protect the people of @entity8 without regime change			1
why are we there in the first place ? because @entity42 was slaughtering his people			0
how can you leave him there ? " @entity192 , former @entity193 spokesman : " the president 's policy is to assist in the removal of @entity42			1
the issue is not with the policy			0
the issue is the mechanism			0
we 're acting in a limited manner to level the playing field so the @entity8 people themselves and the opposition that has formed , they 'll do that job			2
it 's not for the @entity2 to impose that from the outside			1
" former @entity211 gov. @entity210 : " i felt the president was very presidential tonight			1
he explained the purpose : to avert a humanitarian disaster , to protect civilian lives			1
he even added ... a ( potential ) refugee crisis going to @entity217 and @entity218			0
" " i was very satisfied with his speech tonight			1
again , consultation with @entity221 in the days ahead is going to be very important			0
but he explained the objective , and he explained what he wants to do , and the airstrikes have succeeded			0
air defenses of @entity8 have been almost destroyed			0
the rebels are gaining momentum			0
look , they 're probably not perfect revolutionary characters , but they 're sure as heck a lot better than @entity42 staying			0
... i applaud the president tonight			2
" @entity234 , professor of @entity236 studies at @entity237 : " i think it 's the right thing at last			0
i think the president did a great job			0
i 'm not a fan of president @entity1 ; i did n't vote for him			1
i think he should have done this much earlier			0
but ... he finally did it			0
and i think he answered the great questions about this intervention			0
... and he told us the truth : this was always about @entity34			0
it was about a rescue operation that he was forced to do , and i think it 's the right thing			0
" @entity257 , professor of international affairs at @entity258 : " i think ( @entity1 ) ... made clear that we went in to avoid what he described as violence on a horrific scale in @entity34 ; that the mandate of the @entity7 coalition ... is to protect @entity8 civilians			1
i think that makes very clear what success looks like there			0
it means that @entity8 civilians are safe -- safe in their houses , safe in their cities			0
at the same time , he made very clear that in his @entity2 policy -- and the policy of many of our allies -- that @entity8 needs to have a new government that responds to the demands of the @entity8 people , and that we will pursue every diplomatic and economic means to that end			1
and leveling the playing field militarily will certainly help			0
" @entity284 , @entity0 senior political analyst : " i thought in general ( @entity1 ) made a compelling case -- a very strong case for intervention itself on humanitarian grounds			1
he made a compelling case that the @entity2 has helped to organize the international coalition much more rapidly than has happened in the past , as in @entity291			1
and furthermore , i think he made a compelling case that these early @entity2 actions really have accomplished what the @entity2 promised to do , and that was to stop @entity42 from killing other people			1
" but ... the success of the speech ended there , because he left open all these questions about where we go from here if there 's a stalemate -- and there were signs today that there may be a stalemate			1
what are we going to do ? what is @entity17 going to do ? who knows ? i do n't think anybody knows that			0
what is going to happen if @entity42 hangs in there for six months ? what do we do then ? nobody knows			0
what happens if @entity42 gets forced out ? what happens if the regime cracks and they turn on him -- even assassinate him ? what 's the @entity2 ' role going to be in building a new @entity8 ? it thought that was left cloudy , and is going to continue the debate			1
" but give president @entity1 his due			2
on the most important issue that he had to face tonight -- why he went in -- i thought he made a very , very strong case			1
" @entity333 , @entity95 press secretary under president @entity334 " the tricky think here is , when you have a president who does the right thing , but who does it four weeks too late , can you really say it is the right thing ? this is really something that should have been done four weeks ago , when it was really likely that the rebels , by virtue of ... a multilateral action , could have tipped the scales and made @entity42 think ... he needs to get out of there			2
i have a hard time seeing that happen now			0
i think it 's a fight to the finish , and this finish ends up in a stalemate			0

new : @entity210 : @entity1 explained the purpose -- to avert a humanitarian disaster
sen. @entity25 : @entity1 saying regime change wo n't be pursued militarily is " puzzling "
@entity0 's @entity59 : " important " speech explains @entity2 military response is limited
@entity160 : " the president 's speech tonight has made things even murkier "
