for @entity3 , it marked the end of a campaign which had pushed her body to the limit			2
" i 'm almost relieved that it 's over because there 's only so much i felt i could do , " said the 31 - year - old			1
" it 's been a little difficult			0
i 've been thrown a lot of balls these two weeks			0
" when one journalist asked @entity3 if she had considered retiring hurt during the match , it caused some confusion in the press room			2
" are you kidding me ? i 'm not retiring , " responded @entity3 , believing the reporter was asking if she was considering ending her career			2
" oh , you mean , retiring in the match ! oh , i 'm sorry			0
i thought you meant my career			0
" i thought about it like for a nanosecond			0
it 's a quarterfinal of a grand slam			1
even if i have to take off in a wheeler before i retire			0
" defending champion @entity22 had to battle through a tough 77 - minute first set against @entity73 @entity72 , before winning 7 - 5 6 - 1			1
when asked about @entity1 prior to her victory against @entity3 , @entity75 ' @entity22 said : " i think @entity1 is a very , very talented girl			1
i think over the last couple years you see her development , you know , as a tennis player			0
" her game has come together			0
she 's an all round player , very competitive			0
i think she has a good potential			0
it 's just a matter of her getting all those details in place and really wanting to achieve great things			0
