-- @entity3 plans to launch a rocket carrying a satellite between december 10 and 22 , a spokesman for the @entity2 said saturday , according to state - run media			1
the @entity10 rocket will launch from the @entity11 in @entity12 and put a " working satellite " into orbit , the report by the official @entity8 said			1
the planned launch is unusual because it comes during the wintertime and only months after a failed attempt in april			0
on that occasion , @entity18 also said the rocket was supposed to put a satellite into orbit , but the launch was seen by many other countries as cover for a ballistic missile test and drew international condemnation			1
@entity28 spokeswoman @entity27 said another launch " would be a highly provocative act that threatens peace and security in the region			1
" it would be also in direct violation of @entity37 resolutions 1718 and 1874 , under which @entity3 is barred from testing ballistic missile technology , she said in a statement			0
" devoting scarce resources to the development of nuclear weapons and long - range missiles will only further isolate and impoverish @entity3 , " she said			0
" the path to security for @entity3 lies in investing in its people and abiding by its commitments and international obligations			2
" the @entity52 's failed launch in april soured relations with the @entity54 and scuppered a deal for @entity56 to provide thousands of tons of food aid to the @entity60 's malnourished population			2
@entity8 said a second version of the same @entity3 - made @entity63 satellite is to be launched this time			2
scientists and technicians have analyzed the mistakes made in april , when the rocket broke apart shortly after takeoff , and have worked to improve the reliability and precision of the satellite and carrier rocket , the news agency reported			0
the " polar - orbiting earth observation satellite " will blast off southward on a trajectory designed so that parts of the carrier rocket that fall during the launch will not land on neighboring nations , the news agency said			2
it said @entity3 had acted with utmost transparency on its last " peaceful scientific and technological satellite launch , " and would " fully comply with relevant international regulations and usage " this time too			1
@entity86 's @entity85 expressed " serious concern " saturday over its neighbor 's planned launch , saying it was a " long - range missile test in the name of working satellite			1
" if the @entity60 goes ahead with the launch as intended , " it will be faced with a strong response , " the ministry 's statement said			1
" the launch is a severe provocation as it is ignoring the concern and warning from the international community and is a direct challenge to the international community as a whole , " it said			0
@entity86 will work closely with the international community , including fellow members of the so - called six - party talks on @entity3 -- the @entity54 , @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 -- to stop @entity18 's " provocative act , " it added			1
@entity114 foreign secretary @entity113 also condemned the planned launch and urged the @entity3 authorities to abandon the project			1
" failure to do so must lead to a further response by the international community , and will damage the prospects for peace and stability on the @entity124 , " he said in a statement			0
the botched launch in april drew stern criticism from the @entity37 , which repeated demands for @entity18 not to carry out similar tests in the future			0
it followed attempts in 2006 and 2009 that were also judged by international experts as having failed			0
news of the latest planned launch does not come as a complete surprise to @entity3 watchers			2
a @entity54 academic website , 38 @entity60 , published an analysis of commercial satellite images thursday that it said revealed trailers carrying the first two stages of one of the @entity60 's @entity10 rockets near the main missile assembly building at the @entity146 on the country 's west coast			0
the analysis by @entity60 , which is run by the @entity150 at @entity151 , followed the release of an image this week by the satellite imagery company @entity154 that showed increased activity at the launch station			0
38 @entity60 suggested the possible motivation for the activity at the @entity160 site was the planned launch of a satellite - bearing rocket this week by its archrival and neighbor , @entity86			1
@entity165 postponed that launch minutes before takeoff after the discovery of an electronic signal problem			0
top satellite image analyst @entity170 , of @entity154 , told @entity0 earlier this week that a launch on this scale for a second time within a year would be unprecedented for @entity3			1
the @entity3 are looking for " maximum political impact " domestically , regionally and internationally with a test launch such as this , he said , calling it a " very politically motivated event			2
" the timing of a launch at the end of this year would coincide with many consequential events , said @entity170 , including @entity86 's planned launch			2
@entity3 and @entity109 will also be holding another set of bilateral talks early in december and the @entity86 presidential election will take place in less than a month			1
@entity3 - watchers say new leader @entity190 may be responding to internal political pressure from hard - liners to send a message			0
@entity0 's @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 and @entity197 contributed to this report .			0
