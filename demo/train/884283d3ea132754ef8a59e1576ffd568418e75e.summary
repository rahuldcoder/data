-- shady cock - fighting farms are common enough in the @entity2 , but a raid on a small operation in @entity5 south of @entity6 late last year revealed a much larger problem			1
alongside the cock - fighting spurs and breeding paraphernalia , the raid netted 84 kilograms of " shabu " -- the @entity2 street name for methamphetamine or " ice " -- and three affiliates of the deadly @entity17 drug cartel @entity18 were arrested			1
for police , the presence in @entity20 of one of @entity17 's most powerful organized crime groups was a worrying development			1
not only did it point to growing transnational links between crime groups , it also displayed an increased professionalism in " ice " production as it moves away from its ' @entity32 ' image of cellar drug kitchens and backyard meth labs			2
" we have previously received reports that the @entity17 are in the country , but this is the first time we have confirmed that the @entity17 are already here , " senior superintendent @entity36 , chief of the @entity2 national police ( @entity37 ) @entity35 told a news conference			1
@entity37 director general @entity43 said going after the group would " entail more hard work			0
" " we know that they are just starting -- that 's why we have to act immediately to stop them before they can expand their presence , " @entity43 told the news conference			0
notorious syndicate @entity17 's @entity18 drug cartel is one of the most powerful and notorious drug syndicates in the world			1
named after the state on @entity17 's @entity60 where it was formed in 1989 , the cartel 's heartland extends from @entity18 to @entity17 's @entity63 and @entity64 states			1
but it is known to operate in locations as diverse as @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69			0
the group 's leader , @entity72 " @entity73 " @entity70 , escaped from a @entity17 prison in 2001 and was only just captured on saturday during a pre-dawn operation in the @entity77 resort town of @entity78			1
formerly @entity80 drug trafficker -- rated by @entity81 as the most powerful criminal on the planet -- @entity70 played a key role in a drug war that has claimed more than 70,000 lives since it was launched in 2006			0
@entity88 's @entity87 the @entity17 attorney general 's office last year released a report that named @entity88 triad groups @entity91 and @entity93 as the main suspects in the supply of ephedrine and ethyl phenylacetate -- precursor chemicals in the manufacture of " ice " -- to @entity17 cartels feeding into the lucrative @entity103 market for methamphetamine			1
according to the @entity106 , @entity88 's triads already maintain close contact with their @entity20 gang counterparts -- @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , and @entity112 -- whose members operate in @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , and @entity119			2
the raid in the @entity2 , meanwhile , came within days of a major drug raid in @entity122			1
in late december , some 3,000 @entity122 police , equipped with helicopters , sniffer dogs and speedboats , descended on the village of @entity128 in @entity130 province , uncovering @entity122 's largest methamphetamine operation to date			0
three tons of methamphetamine worth an estimated $ 234 million were seized from 77 clandestine meth laboratories , and 182 arrests were made -- including the town 's @entity136 boss @entity135 and 13 other party officials			2
the raid was further evidence of a growing industrialization of crystal meth production			0
industrial scale before 2012 , @entity122 police mostly dismantled small - scale operators , but in september of that year , police raided their first industrial - scale facility in @entity148 , seizing 660kg of crystal meth and 19.8 metric tons of unidentified materials used in the manufacture of the drug			2
among the 14 people arrested in the raid , one was a @entity17 national , a development which analysts say was the first indication that @entity17 transnational syndicates were working closely with the @entity122 to produce crystal meth			1
professor @entity162 , an analyst in illegal drug trends at the @entity164 , said @entity122 's meth labs were increasingly internationalizing their illegal drugs operations			2
" the manufacturing in @entity130 ? i suspect that much of that was for export , " she told @entity0			0
she said the @entity170 and the @entity171 had long identified @entity122 as a country where the precursor chemical ephedrine was being exported to other countries for the manufacturing of various amphetamine drugs			0
the huge scale of @entity122 's chemical industry , with an estimated 80,000 individual chemical companies in 2009 , presents widespread opportunities for chemical diversion , according to the @entity171			0
@entity88 , once the bottleneck through which @entity122 contraband was forced to pass -- and on a @entity103 blacklist for the transit of heroin throughout the 1970s and 1980s before being removed in the 1990s -- is no longer the only gateway for drugs manufactured in @entity122 , @entity162 said			0
" there are many large ports in @entity122 where drugs can be imported and exported quite easily , " she said .			0

@entity2 meth raid leads to arrests of @entity17 drug cartel affiliates
the cartel , @entity18 , is known as one of the most powerful drug syndicates in the world
police view the cartel 's expansion into @entity20 as a worrying development
