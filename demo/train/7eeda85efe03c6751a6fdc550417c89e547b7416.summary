-- the prime ministers of @entity2 and @entity3 on saturday announced an agreement aimed at reducing human smuggling and illegal migration to @entity2			1
under the deal struck between the two countries , the next 800 asylum - seekers who arrive in @entity2 illegally will be transferred to @entity3 for refugee status determination			1
in exchange , over the next four years , @entity2 will take in 4,000 refugees who are already residing in @entity3			1
" i made it very clear that what i wanted to do was to break the back of the people smuggling model , to take away from them the very product that they sell , to stop people risking their lives at sea and to stop people profiting from human misery , " @entity2 prime minister @entity13 said at a news conference			2
" i wanted to see us do something to end the profitability of people smuggling			0
" the agreement is also seen as a way to address what has become a political debate in @entity2 over the arrival of unauthorized immigrants			1
thousands of refugees seek asylum in @entity2 each year , said @entity40 , ceo of the @entity41 of @entity2 , an umbrella organization for groups that support refugees			1
each year , 4.1 million travelers visit @entity2 on temporary visas			0
of those , 4,000 - 5,000 -- mostly from @entity47 -- seek asylum , @entity40 said			0
but this is n't the group that has stirred controversy			0
opposition politicians have raised concerns about the asylum - seekers who are smuggled in , arriving in makeshift boats to the country			0
this amounts to a level of political fear - mongering , @entity40 said			0
still , in the last several years , asylum - seekers who reach @entity2 illegally have reached about 4,500 per year , @entity40 said			2
most of those come from @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 , and go travel through @entity3 -- a transit point for many refugees headed for @entity2			1
the agreement is an attempt to remove the incentive to sneak into @entity2			0
" under this arrangement , if someone seeks to come to @entity2 then they are at risk of going to @entity3 and going to the back of the queue -- that 's what it means , " @entity13 said			1
in other words , those 800 who are transferred from @entity2 to @entity3 will not get preferential treatment over those refugees who are already there and have already begun to apply for asylum in @entity2			1
but @entity40 sees some red flags with the new deal			0
for one , he said , @entity3 , unlike @entity2 , is not a signatory to the 1951 @entity89			2
@entity3 does not have a good record of dealing with refugees and has been down to arbitrarily detain asylum - seekers , @entity40 said			2
according to the agreement , the @entity93 high commissioner for refugees will be process the asylum - seekers once they arrive in @entity3			2
despite the political fires being stoked in @entity2 over unauthorized asylum - seekers , there is broad bipartisan support in the country for its resettlement program			1
under the deal , for every migrant sent from @entity2 to @entity3 , @entity2 will intake five refugees from @entity3			1
" we 've been a generous country in the past over our history , over many decades resettling people who were fleeing persecution and of course i believe we will continue to do that over the years to come , " @entity13 said			0
other steps will be taken in the future to address the migration issue as well , she said			0
@entity0 's @entity117 contributed to this report .			0

unauthorized migrants arriving in @entity2 is a political issue
under the new plan , the next 800 illegal migrants will be sent to @entity3
in @entity3 , they will make their claims for asylum
in exchange , @entity2 will accept 4,000 refugees from @entity3
