@entity0 -- they are the numbers we 've all been waiting for and @entity5 @entity4 have unsuccessfully tried to get out of the @entity7 administration			0
this week , the @entity8 will reveal how many people purchased policies on the federal @entity12 exchange website			2
technical failures have plagued @entity14 since its october 1 launch , although officials say it 's slowly getting better			0
@entity5 spokesman @entity17 says enrollment numbers " will be lower than we hoped and we anticipated			0
" @entity20 losing patience with @entity12 just how low and what effect all of those online roadblocks had on enrollment remain to be seen			0
but what will the numbers mean about the health of @entity12 ? q : how many people need to enroll ? the nonpartisan @entity30 estimates that 24 million people will purchase insurance through an exchange by 2023 , but just seven million will enroll during the initial sign - up window ending march 31			1
@entity30 's estimate includes customers on both state - based and federally run insurance exchanges , but not individuals who enroll in @entity39			1
if that number is spread evenly over the course of the open enrollment period , 1.16 million people would need to purchase insurance each month in order for the administration to be on pace to reach the seven million figure in six months			1
but officials both in and out of government are quick to point out that enrollment is unlikely to occur at an even pace			0
pro-obamacare group raises $ 27 million for outreach to make that case , president @entity7 recently traveled to @entity55 where then - gov. @entity56 enacted similar health care reforms in 2006			2
" enrollment was extremely slow , within a month only about a hundred people had signed up , " the president told a crowd in @entity60 in late october , recounting data from the state 's first open - enrollment period			1
" but then , 2,000 had signed up , and then a few more thousand after that			0
and by the end of the year , 36,000 people had signed up			2
" on @entity1 the day after the president 's trip , @entity70 economist @entity69 , a former health care adviser to both @entity56 and @entity7 , argued that the first month 's numbers are n't that useful in estimating the pace of enrollment			2
" the key deadline here is march 31 , that 's when people have to have insurance to avoid the individual mandate , " @entity69 said of the deadline for avoiding a financial penalty for not having any health coverage			2
" that 's still months away			0
" a consumer behavior expert said the slow pace of enrollment early could be attributed to buying habits			0
@entity90 , consumer psychology professor at @entity91 , compared it to paying rent or a mortgage when it 's due , rather than before a bill is received			0
until payment is submitted , the door remains open to back out or make changes			0
" once i pay , i 've kind of made that commitment , " @entity90 added			0
arguably more important than the overall enrollment number is the diversity of the new customer pool			0
the administration is working to ensure that 40 % of those on the new exchanges are relatively healthy between 18 and 35			0
" part of the challenge is to make sure that the exchanges are able to attract a broad cross section of people , sick people and healthier young people so that the coverage is affordable , " said @entity107 , president and ceo of the @entity109			2
an unbalanced insurance pool could cause insurers to increase monthly premiums or pull out of the exchanges altogether in future years			1
@entity122 : @entity7 should honor commitments on keeping health plans what about @entity39 enrollees ? customers whose income falls below a certain threshold are automatically referred to their state 's medicaid program			1
the @entity12 offers subsidies to states to increase @entity39 qualification to 138 % of the federal poverty level , and 25 states and the @entity0 have taken up the federal offer so far			1
if your state has opted to expand @entity39 , you 'll likely be referred to your state 's welfare agency if you make less than $ 15,800 and are seeking coverage as an individual , or $ 32,500 if you 're seeking it for a family of four			1
the @entity30 estimates that nine million people will enroll in @entity39 and its partner initiative for children , the @entity148 , by 2014			1
according to this estimate , that number will increase to 13 million by 2023			0
media report : fewer than 50,000 signed up for @entity12 what if my state did n't expand @entity39 ? the authors of the @entity12 intended @entity39 expansion to be mandatory , but a @entity158 decision in 2010 ruled the federal government could n't require expansion of a state - run program			1
this decision led 25 states to opt out			2
if you make less than the federal poverty level , you will be referred to your state medicaid agency to see if you qualify for benefits under the current law , regardless of whether your state has expanded @entity39 or not			1
according to a study by the @entity171 , only four states that did n't expand @entity39 offer benefits to parents with incomes up to the federal poverty level , and only @entity177 offers benefits to adults without children			1
if your state chose not to expand its @entity39 program , you can still purchase insurance on the exchange , but you might not qualify for a premium subsidy			1
federal subsidies kick in for those with income above 100 % of the federal poverty level			0
due to the @entity158 decision and the structure of the law , a large group of low - income @entity190 wo n't qualify for @entity39 in their state , but will earn less than the federal poverty level , meaning they wo n't qualify for any federal subsidies			1
according to the @entity109 , roughly five million people will fall into this @entity39 coverage gap			1
what does " enroll " mean , anyway ? regardless of whether you 're signing up on @entity14 or one of the state - run exchanges , there are several steps in the enrollment process			1
you must first create an account and enter in some personal information , including your social security number and an estimate of your annual income			0
this information is then verified through the federal data hub with various government agencies , such as the @entity214 and the @entity215			0
then you 'll either be presented with the plans available in your coverage area and an estimate for what those plans will cost after any federal subsidy is factored in , or you 'll be told you qualify for @entity39 and referred to your state 's medicaid agency			1
if you 're eligible to purchase a plan on the exchange , you can compare the plans available to find one that best fits your budget and coverage needs			0
many insurance companies and state - based exchanges do n't classify customers as officially enrolled until they 've paid their first premium			1
others will count people as enrolled once they 've selected a plan			2
a spokeswoman for the @entity239 confirmed tuesday that the numbers the government plans to announce will reveal how many consumers have completed an application and selected a plan , not necessarily how many have paid			0
consumers have until december 15 to pay if they want coverage beginning on january 1 , or until march 31 if they simply want to avoid paying the penalty for not having insurance			2
according to @entity1 's tally , at least 54,700 people have paid for insurance on the state - based exchanges , but many more have made it partially through the process , completing an application and selecting a plan			1
various news outlets have reported that fewer than 50,000 people have signed up and paid for new private insurance plans through the federal marketplace , @entity14			2
neither the @entity8 nor officials at @entity239 would confirm those numbers .			0

an unbalanced insurance pool could lead to *higher* premiums , insurers pulling out
@entity30 estimates nine million people will enroll in @entity39 or partner program for children
2010 @entity158 decision *overturned* mandatory plan for states to expand @entity39
many insurers and state - based exchanges do n't consider customers enrolled until they pay first
