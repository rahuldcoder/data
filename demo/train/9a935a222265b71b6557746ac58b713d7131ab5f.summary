-- on thursday morning , @entity1 released mockups of what it says the next @entity4 is going to look like , according to the site 's own unnamed sources			1
the main differences in appearance between the next @entity4 and the current @entity9 ? a metal back , a smaller dock connector , a 20 percent decrease in thickness , and a longer 4 - inch display			1
concept designs for future iphones are a dime a dozen and usually look like something @entity20 might have slapped together after a glue - induced aneurysm			0
but @entity1 's concept looks pretty good			0
it may not prove to be an accurate prediction in the end , but it 's a sensible proposal			0
the most obvious change in @entity1 's mockup is the 4 - inch screen			1
that 's a big bump , as the @entity4 's display has stayed at 3.5 inches with a 3:2 aspect ratio since 2007			1
why in the world would @entity32 change it now ? it all comes down to @entity36			2
@entity36 radios take up more room in a smartphone than @entity41 radios and use more power			0
to put @entity36 capabilities in the next @entity4 , you need to make room not just for the radio , but find enough juice to power it without significantly decreasing battery life			1
the problem is there 's just not a lot of room inside an @entity4 for anything more than is already there			2
an @entity4 is a densely packed sandwich of silicon , radios , flash storage , motors and cameras			0
over the past five generations , @entity32 has packed in everything that makes up an iphone about as densely as possible , and the battery still makes up the bulk of every device			0
if it 's going to fit anything else , @entity32 needs to make more room			2
that 's one reason why @entity1 is saying @entity32 will be ditching its current dock connector for a micro-sized version : space saved in this area is space @entity32 can stuff with a larger battery or make for a bigger @entity36 chipset			1
but it 's also a reason why @entity32 would make the display bigger			0
there 's been a lot of talk over the last couple of years that with the @entity4 , @entity32 would bump the display up to a larger four inches , but the rumor 's always had a lot of problems			1
increasing the @entity4 's display while maintaining its current 3:2 aspect ratio would make the device wider in the hand and harder to operate one - handed			1
it would also either decrease the pixel density of the @entity4 's @entity88 , making it less " retina - ey " and more jaggy to the eyes , or require more pixels per inch to compensate , causing @entity4 developers to design their apps for multiple resolutions ( the exact same kind of fragmentation problem that 's bitten @entity103 on its ass )			2
that 's why conventional wisdom ( until a couple months ago ) was that @entity32 would keep a 3.5 - inch display and eschew @entity36 until the radios were sufficiently small and power - efficient to fit into the current @entity4 's form factor			1
but with the new @entity111 's @entity110 + @entity113 release , @entity32 has made it abundantly clear that it is finally ready to embrace @entity36			2
and the way the company is going to do it is by making the @entity4 's display longer , but not wider			0
this theory was first floated over on @entity120 , then gained traction when daring @entity123 's @entity122 hinted that the person who had initially suggested it might just work for @entity32 , and know what direction the next @entity4 would go			2
it 's got a lot to recommend it			0
by ditching a 3:2 aspect ratio in favor of a 9:5 display , the new @entity4 would feel about the same in the hand as the @entity9 , retain its current 326ppi resolution , and allow @entity32 room for an @entity36 chip and more battery			1
apps could either be easily updated to support the new @entity4 's 4 - inch display without breaking compatibility with 3.5 - inch devices , or run in a letterbox without modification at their existing resolution			1
lengthening the display allows the @entity4 in landscape view to show 16:9 videos without the ugly bars on either side			0
it gives game developers more room for on - screen controls , like virtual buttons and thumbsticks , without a gamer 's fingers obscuring what 's on the display			0
only @entity32 knows for sure what the next @entity4 will look like , but @entity1 's concept is n't necessarily all wet			1
putting the display on a stretching rack might be the key to getting an @entity165 this year			0
and if you think @entity169 would never mess around with an @entity171 's aspect ratio like this , might i introduce you to our good schizophrenic friend , the @entity175 nano ? subscribe to @entity176 for less than $ 1 an issue and get a free gift ! click here ! copyright 2011 @entity180 .			0

@entity32 news site @entity1 releases mockups of what it says the next @entity4 is going to look like
@entity1 says new phone will have a 4 - inch screen , up from the current model 's 3.5 inches
to put @entity36 capabilities in the next @entity4 , @entity32 will need to make more room
