a trove of emails from former @entity4 gov. @entity3 's time in @entity5 reveal a hands - on chief executive who was a prolific @entity8 user			1
@entity3 , who is considering a 2016 presidential run , planned on releasing the tens of thousands of emails next month			1
but the @entity11 got out ahead of him , obtaining the emails through a public records request and publishing them late tuesday			0
while @entity3 was clearly aware that the emails could go public one day , the notes offer an insider 's perspective on @entity3 's time in office and his dealings on issues ranging from land disputes to funding for a military base in @entity4 and the state 's citrus industry			2

a personal touch @entity3 exchanged emails with hundreds of constituents sharing their advice and concerns on specific issues -- with such high - level discussions even including a quick reply to a woman asking for the date of his wife 's birthday			1
@entity3 even personally responded to job applicants , revealing what the @entity11 called an " intense , detail - oriented engagement " as governor			1
on one of his top issues , for example , @entity3 received a " daily immigration update			0
" awesome " emails the former governor also took a casual approach in his emails , which he peppered with words like " my bad , " " chill out " and " awesome			1
" and @entity3 was also apparently a big believer in the power of the smiley face			2
as staffers exchanged emails about vacation time , @entity3 suggested that " you guys h that you guys have a verbal conversation about it rather than create a public document			2

" " i am truly sorry you feel that way			0
have a nice day , " @entity3 said , throwing in a smiley face			2
@entity74 @entity3 slammed president @entity76 's decision last week to normalize relations with @entity74 , and it 's clear from the emails that he 's remained consistent on that issue			1
in a 1999 email , @entity3 pledged to stand for a tough policy on the island , telling then - rep. @entity84 that " forceful diplomacy can make a difference			0
" that stance has n't kept sen. @entity88 , a @entity3 mentee and potential 2016 foe , from stealing the spotlight last week as he jumped in front of the cameras to become the @entity94 's leading voice on opposing @entity76 's engagement with the @entity74 regime			1
campaign finance reform -- and a brother 's shadow one email exchange with a top @entity94 donor , @entity101 , gives a candid glimpse at @entity3 's stance on campaign finance laws			1
in the email , @entity101 encourages @entity3 to support a campaign finance reform law working its way through the @entity4 legislature , but the governor balks , explaining that he 's only in favor of " campaign finance reform that does n't put us at a disadvantage			1
" and the bill in question , " would do just that , " @entity3 wrote			0
the exchange also reveals an interesting angle the @entity94 donor uses as he looks to secure the governor 's support			2
" your brother thinks it 's the right thing to do , " @entity101 writes			0
conservative criticism lauded by many in the @entity94 establishment as a smart , fiscally conservative governor who delivered economic gains for his state , the emails also reveal a challenge from the party 's most conservative members that @entity3 is likely to face in an eventual @entity94 presidential primary			1
he received one email branding him as " no conservative " and regularly took flak from activists who wanted more right - leaning policies out of the governor 's mansion , according to the @entity11			0
one pro-life activist attacks @entity3 in an email for appointing a lawyer who represented the owner of an abortion clinic .			0

@entity3 personally responds to hundreds of constituent emails and personally answering job applicants
he also takes a casual approach with plenty of smileys and expressions like " chill out " and " my bad "
the emails also show he 's remained consistent on @entity74 , and is n't a big campaign finance reform *advocate*
and the emails give some insight into the conservative *backlash* he could face in a 2016 @entity94 primary
