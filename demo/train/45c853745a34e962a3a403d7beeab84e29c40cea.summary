-- in the cold rain outside a girl 's school in @entity5 , a queue stretches several hundred meters down the road			1
some are dressed in western clothes , others in traditional shalwar kameez			0
one man is wearing overalls covered in paint from the work site he 's just come from			1
they 've been waiting for over an hour but they do n't mind -- they 're here to make history and change the course of their country			2
a 5 - year - old boy stands next to his father , holding his hand , unaware of what all the fuss is about			0
in his other hand he holds his father 's voting card -- an @entity33 's ticket to democracy			1
" we work for him , " says an old man pointing at the child			0
" this is why we 're all here to vote -- to build a better future for all our children			2
" arriving at the gates of the school , smiling from ear to ear , mp @entity42 goes through the women 's entrance			1
" i feel fantastic , proud happy , successful , " she says			0
" i feel really good because i believe today is my day because the people of @entity33 can go and vote freely			1
" the crowds are fantastic and that 's a big slap in the face for the @entity53 and terrorists who kill our children			1
they stop people coming from election and they do n't believe in democracy			2
see ? all ( these ) wonderful people are coming to practice democracy			0
" the citizens of @entity33 would be forgiven for not wanting to come and stand in these long lines outside almost 6,500 polling stations around the country			1
the @entity53 launched a series of high - profile attacks in the lead up to the historic elections , warning that anyone who participated in the vote would be punished			1
but despite the threats and the violence the voters are defying the insurgents , rejecting their message of fear			1
" we are not afraid of the threats , " explains @entity42			2
" as much as they kill us , we get ... stronger , as much as they killed our children , our journalists , innocent women , we say ' no. ' we will go and vote because we are fed up			2
we want to see real change , we want to enjoy our democracy			2
" her 17 - year - old daughter @entity80 , proudly listens to her mother			0
she 's heard these words before but today is different -- today change is really happening			1
" i hope @entity85 wins , " she tells me with excitement even though she ca n't vote for another year			2
" i hope he wins because i think he 's the best of the candidates and he 's got ideas , bright ideas that will help our country			2
" when i ask @entity80 what sort of future she would like to see for @entity33 , she tells me , " honestly a bright future , a future that is good for us , good for all the people , for girls , good for women -- you know , a bright future ! " inside the school , past the layers of security , men and women troop off into different buildings where they line up again , this time in classrooms that have been transformed into polling booths			1
each one shows their voter card to the @entity116 official and has their name marked off the list			0
their forefinger is then dipped into indelible ink -- proof that they 've voted -- and they pick up their ballot papers			0
" it is very important for the future of @entity33 , " says a father of three , after placing his papers into clear , locked plastic containers			1
" i 'm very happy everyone is participating in the election			0
we are deciding the future and we want someone to protect our people and stop the war			0
" it was hoped president @entity140 would achieve peace during his 12 years in office but as he departs after a constitutionally - restricted two terms at the helm , he leaves behind a war - torn country , mired by corruption and whose relationship with the @entity149 is at an all - time low			0
@entity140 has refused to sign the @entity150 ( @entity151 ) that would ensure an enduring presence of @entity149 troops post 2014 , creating a schism with the @entity149 government			0
the three top candidates -- @entity85 , @entity157 and @entity158 -- have all said they would sign the @entity151			0
while voter fraud was a big problem back in 2009 , when @entity140 was accused of stealing the election , this year 300,000 observers are taking part to ensure the vote is free and fair			1
" so far it 's really good , we have n't noticed any voter fraud , " says @entity165 of the @entity166 of @entity33			1
" it is very important to observe , " he says			0
" it 's my duty for my country and as an @entity33 citizen i want these elections to be a success			1
" so does 24 - year - old @entity175 , a mother of two , who has only known a life of war			0
" i 'm here to elect a good president so the bombings and ( the ) war ends			0
