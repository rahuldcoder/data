your @entity4 " likes " might be revealing more than you know about your private life			1
it is possible to predict potentially private traits such as a person 's sexual orientation , political leanings , religion , intelligence , emotional stability and even if they abuse drugs or alcohol , just by analyzing their @entity4 likes , according to a new study out of the @entity16			1
liking something on @entity4 is a simple , almost mindless way to pass time on the social networking site , which says it has more than a billion users worldwide			1
with one click , people can " like " pages -- for brands , public figures , memes , music and groups -- as well as articles , photos or status updates from their friends			2
but that quick action can be a powerful statement			0
" facebook likes have a meaning that we can use to understand the psychology behind what people do , " says @entity35 , a co-author of the study			1
researchers looked at the @entity4 profiles and likes , along with surveys and personality tests , for 58,466 individuals			1
using that data , they developed a model that predicts personal attributes from @entity4 likes with impressive accuracy			1
it has the best luck categorizing people as @entity56 or @entity55 ( 95 % accuracy ) , followed by gender , male sexuality , @entity61 or @entity62 leanings , and detecting @entity63 and @entity64			2
one of more unusual categories was whether a person 's parents had split before they turned 21 , which had a relatively low 60 % level of accuracy ( still high enough to benefit advertisers , noted the researchers )			0
these people were more more likely to like statements about relationships , such as " if i 'm with you then i 'm with you			0
i do n't want anybody else , " and " i 'm sorry i love you			0
" " it gives us a poignant insight into the effects that parental breakup has on children even after they grow up , " says @entity35			0
the likes themselves are a combination of obvious and baffling			2
liking " @entity88 , " " @entity89 , " or the musical " wicked " were found to be strong indicators that a man was gay , while liking sports - related topics , " @entity95 " and " being confused after waking up from @entity96 " were more popular with straight men , according to the the study			2
a person 's @entity4 likes can also be used to predict intelligence , say the researchers			1
liking " @entity102 , " " science , " " @entity104 " and the mysterious " @entity105 " indicates someone is highly intelligent			0
lower intelligence was suggested by likes for " @entity109 , " " @entity110 " and " @entity111 , " according to the study			1
likes for " beerpong , " " @entity115 " and " cheerleading " were strong predictors of an extrovert while " role playing games , " " @entity120 " and " @entity122 " pointed to introverted personality types			1
" @entity124 " and " @entity125 " indicated neurotic personalities , " @entity130 " and " serial killer " were liked by spontaneous people , and competitive types liked " @entity128 " and " i hate everyone			0
" researchers are opening up the tool to everyone so they can get a peek at their own personal results			0
people can check out what their @entity4 likes say about them by visiting @entity139 and logging in with their @entity4 profile			1
the site does an instant personality test and rates how open , stable , agreeable , extroverted and conscientious a person is			2
while the data is analyzed by researchers to improve the overall test , any personal information is stripped out			2
do n't try judging friends based on individual likes , however			2
researchers looked at all of a person 's likes to make their predictions , and even then the tool is n't perfect			2
" it 's like meeting someone for a blind date : if you just ask one question then you ca n't make an accurate judgment about them			0
but once you 've had an hour - long conversation about their favorite hobbies , interests , brands , and celebrities , then you can start to have some confidence in who they are , " says @entity35			0
the more likes a person has made , the easier it is to accurately predict these larger nuggets of information about their personalities			1
profiles used in this study had anywhere from one to 500 likes on the social network , though the average number of things people liked was 170			1
the data was collected by a site called @entity187 , which turns serious data gathering for academic research purposes into fun quizzes			0
a similar @entity192 experiment in 2009 predicted whether people were gay based on who they had friended on @entity4			1
at the time , the concept of deducting potentially private information about someone was more shocking			1
these days , it 's becoming more common and expected			0
@entity35 says companies are already using these kinds of machine - learning models to make connections , though the companies may not know that they 're measuring iq or extroversion			0
companies like @entity207 and @entity4 decide what ads to show people by using scraps of information they gather as users go about their regular browsing and clicking routines			1
@entity215 recommends products by looking at a customer 's @entity215 browsing history and past purchases			0
the next step is connecting all the dots and gathering clues about a person to create a more complete picture of who they are			0
there are potential positive benefits , such as custom recommendations for movies and restaurants based on your location and what you 've enjoyed in the past , or ads that only pitch products you might actually want to buy			2
but there is also a loss of privacy when data is collected about people without their permission			0
gleaning potentially sensitive information about someone that is n't explicitly shared , such as sexual orientation or drug use , could be abused by companies as well as governments and potential employers			1
" my biggest concern is that people do not realize what is possible , so they think that frivolous behaviors such as liking something can not possibly say anything important about them , " says @entity35 .			0

new study uses @entity4 likes to predict private personality traits such as sexuality
the *technology* could be used for more customized online *services* in the future
but there is also great potential to abuse this kind of information
