editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			1
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity5 ) -- march 11 marks the one - year anniversary of the largest @entity20 catastrophe since @entity21 the unforgettable triple disaster was triggered by the 9.0 - magnitude @entity24 earthquake , resulting in a devastating tsunami and subsequent nuclear meltdown at the @entity28 power plant , the effects of which are still being felt today			1
three months after the earthquake , we set out for @entity31 with @entity33 - winning singer , songwriter and producer @entity35 , who has a strong affinity for @entity20 culture and has been strongly involved in @entity24 's music and fashion scenes for the last decade			1
we wanted to see how the young population of this iconic city was coping with the aftermath and ongoing elements of the crisis			2
what was most memorable in the capital was a darkened @entity47 , arguably the most famous crosswalk in the world , and a symbol of @entity31 the same way @entity52 is to @entity8 or @entity53 to @entity54			0
to see it with all the lights and advertisements and video screens turned off was profoundly unsettling , and immediately recalled the eerie quiet of lower @entity60 in the weeks after september 11			0
the rolling blackouts and voluntary power outages to conserve energy added to an atmosphere of nervous desolation already fostered by the flight of foreigners to their home countries and native @entity20 further south , as worried @entity31 residents tried to come to terms with the scope of the disaster and fear of the very air around them			2
at the same time , the city kept going			0
the spirit of post- 3/11 @entity24 and the resilience and stoicism of its citizens has drawn comparisons to the reaction of @entity8 and @entity85 residents in the wake of the 9/11 attacks , but it is also a testament to the more celebrated aspects of @entity24 's national character			1
the @entity20 people live in one of the most volatile regions in the world			2
the country 's islands are situated on the westernmost edge of the @entity98 and are regularly subjected to earthquakes , storms , and floods			0
the threat of calamity and exposure to the violence of nature is part of the daily fabric of @entity20 life			2
disaster is ingrained in the national psyche and has been an object of consistent cultural fixation -- it 's in their art , movies , and literature , and has been for centuries			0
see the rest of @entity120 at @entity5 what was exciting to witness amid the organized efforts at recovery and general collective response , was how the events of march 11 have spurred @entity20 youth to an interrogation of traditional society			1
for the first time in years , the national government and media are under widespread scrutiny , leading many citizens -- especially those in their 20s and 30s -- to turn inward and rely on each other for information via social media like @entity140 , blogs , @entity142 and @entity143			1
a noticeable shift has taken hold of @entity31 's creative class -- young @entity20 seem suddenly possessed of a social and political consciousness at odds with their generation 's portrayal as detached , passive and apathetic			1
there 's a fire in the hearts of the young creatives we spoke with and new questions that are just starting to be asked out loud			2
through art , creativity , entrepreneurship or protest , @entity31 's youth have begun asserting an active and individualistic will that runs counter to much of traditional @entity20 thinking			1
undeniably , @entity24 is at a crossroads			0
many of the old systems that governed the accepted @entity20 " life path " had already lost their clout long before march 11 -- assumptions like lifetime employment , job security , financial security started coming into question with the economic downturn of the previous decade			0
this is the story of the youth of @entity31 beginning to peer over the wall of the established structures to look for the other possibilities their society has to offer			0
and in the process , redefine their @entity20 identity and what it means to be young and creative in @entity24 today .			1

@entity5 looks at how young people in @entity24 are coping one year after the tsunami
@entity35 , who has deep interest in @entity24 's music and fashion scenes , leads the way
crew finds a *breakout* social media scene that 's at odds with traditional @entity20 ways
