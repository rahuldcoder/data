@entity122 and @entity12 panicked upon finding the child dead , @entity34 said			1
@entity34 dropped another bombshell when explaining @entity12 's behavior in the month before @entity3 was reported missing on july 15 -- partying at clubs and lying about the child 's whereabouts			1
he said @entity12 was sexually abused by her father starting at age 8 , and was " hiding her pain , " as she had been taught from an early age to behave as if nothing was wrong			2

" if i 'd have known something happened to @entity3 , we would n't be here today , " he said			2
as a former police officer , he said , he was trained in cpr and would have done everything possible to save his granddaughter 's life if he found her in the pool as @entity34 alleged			0
@entity34 also alleged tuesday that @entity3 was inappropriately touched by her brother , @entity147 , although " it did n't go as far " as it had with her father			2
it was bad enough , however , he said , that the @entity149 conducted a paternity test to see if @entity151 had fathered @entity3			0
he told jurors the @entity155 " keeps its secrets quiet			0
... you 're going to hear all kinds of bizarre family behavior			0
" on wednesday , pictures of @entity12 , @entity22 and @entity110 at the @entity161 nightclub were introduced into evidence by prosecutors , over @entity34 's objections			1
the others testified about partying with her at nightclubs , including her participation in a " hot body " contest on one occasion			0
two women who worked as " shot girls , " selling alcoholic shots to club patrons , testified wednesday that @entity12 was a sort of overseer , telling them where to be and looking out for them to make sure they were n't harmed			0
one , @entity179 , said that @entity12 , in a conversation on july 15 , hours before @entity12 's mother reported the child missing , told her for the first time about her daughter , and invited her to @entity3 's birthday party the following month			1
@entity179 said she received a text message the following day asking for help in finding the little girl			0
the other , @entity189 , testified that @entity12 made a remark in passing about having a daughter , but did n't know the child 's name or age			1
@entity179 and @entity98 said @entity12 never told them @entity3 was missing in the 31 days before her disappearance was reported			1
@entity34 asked @entity20 and @entity22 the same question : whether they were present at the @entity12 home on june 16 when @entity3 allegedly drowned in the pool			1
both men said they were not			0
@entity34 attempted to ask @entity12 whether @entity12 had told him she was sexually abused by her father , but @entity204 chief judge @entity203 sustained prosecutors ' objections and would not let @entity12 answer the question			0
meanwhile on wednesday , the attorney for meter reader @entity209 , who found @entity3 's skeletal remains in december 2008 , issued a second statement denying @entity34 's tuesday allegations that @entity209 had found the remains in an unknown location and moved them to where they were later discovered in an attempt to cash in on the high - profile case			1
" the suggestion that mr. @entity209 took possession of @entity3 's remains is totally lacking in logic or explanation , " attorney @entity220 said			1
" it did not happen			0
" @entity209 has been truthful with authorities , he said , and " the defense team has tried repeatedly to cast @entity209 in the role of bad guy , even to the extent of making statements about him on national television that they knew to be false			0
" after tuesday 's court session , an attorney for @entity121 and @entity3 issued a statement responding to the claims @entity34 made during his opening remarks			2
" @entity121 and @entity3 are shocked and appalled that the defense would resort to lies about them in today 's opening statement			2
@entity34 's idle speculation today certainly are not facts			0
the only result achieved by the defense in this statement was to further hurt this grieving family , " @entity19 attorney @entity246 said in the written statement			0
" @entity12 maintains that he never had anything to do with the death of @entity3 including what happened to her remains after she allegedly drowned , " @entity246 added			1
in an appearance later tuesday on @entity259 's " @entity258 , " @entity246 was more pointed in his remarks , saying @entity34 's accusations were " all just fiction			0
his opening ( statement ) was fiction , and there 's nowhere to go with it			0
" '' everything he ( @entity34 ) said about @entity121 was a complete and utter lie , and i am , for one , very proud of my client for being able to sit there as he did and just be able to take what was said about him without showing the reaction that i felt myself on his behalf , '' @entity246 added			0
earlier tuesday , prosecutor @entity276 told jurors in her opening statement that while it may be difficult to accept that a mother could kill her own child , there is no other conclusion that can be drawn , based on the evidence			0
" no one but @entity3 had access to all the pieces of evidence in this case , " @entity276 said			0
" ... no one else lied to their friends , to their family , to investigators			0
no one else benefited from the death of @entity3			0
@entity3 's death allowed @entity3 to live the good life -- at least for 31 days			1
" @entity259 's " @entity258 " producers @entity299 and @entity301 contributed to this report			0
