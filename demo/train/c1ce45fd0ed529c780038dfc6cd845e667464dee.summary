@entity0 -- -- i am originally from @entity3 but i moved to @entity0 more than 12 years ago			1
i chose to live in this city because of the @entity6 river wave where you can surf on a rapid			1
for most people around the world @entity0 is only known as " @entity9 " , the town of beer drinkers and pretzel lovers			1
most people do n't know that @entity0 is also considered to be a surfing @entity14 because of the famous standing wave right in the centre of the city at the @entity6 river			1
for me it was vice versa			0
through surfing this rapid i discovered the @entity9			0
and since then i 've been hooked			0
even weeks and days before the beer fest starts , the whole city gets crazy			1
you must imagine , a city with about 1.5 million inhabitants gets visited by about six million people			1
tourists of all different nationalities are arriving , flight prices to @entity0 double and the main train station is crowded at all times			0
but also locals from @entity0 begin to get all excited , start to count the days and get prepared			0
the stores where you can buy the original @entity36 costumes , the " @entity37 " for the guys and the " @entity39 " for the ladies , are so packed that you can hardly enter			1
this year me and my friends from the @entity6 did a special @entity9 warm - up as well			1
some days before the beginning of the @entity9 we went surfing on the river in " @entity46 " and " @entity39 " instead of wetsuits			1
it was one of the most fun surf sessions i ever experienced			1
but let 's come back to the " @entity51 " -- that is how locals call the " @entity9 " -- and have a look at what a typical tour should include			1
a good @entity9 visit usually starts with a fresh " @entity58 " of beer			1
if the weather is nice , you should have it in the sunshine in one of the beer gardens outside of the tents			1
the most typical food that goes perfectly with it is either one of the giant pretzels or a half a grilled chicken			0
they say that the " @entity74 " ( @entity36 for grilled chicken halves ) are especially good at the @entity9			0
that is maybe why about 500,000 of them get eaten up during the two weeks			0
after you have enjoyed your first beer and some good food , you should check out some rides			1
there are the traditional ones			0
like @entity83 , a slide that has been at the @entity9 for 75 years			0
to go up , you hop on a conveyer and usually there is a big crowd of people having a blast , just watching who can make it up there without falling			1
if you are a tourist you should also take a ride on the @entity94 ( @entity95 )			1
it might look a bit lame but it is 55 meters high and you will get a beautiful view over @entity0			0
if you feel like competing with your friends , visit the so called @entity101 ( devil 's wheel ) , a turning wheel where people can jump on			1
just stay on the wheel			0
it gets tricky when the wheel is spinning faster and faster and punching balls swing by			0
after you had fun on the rides and bought your girlfriend a heart made of @entity115 ( ginger cake ) , it is time to go to where the real party is and help the locals drink more than 60,000 hectoliters of beer			1
visit one of the 14 big beer tents run by six @entity36 breweries			1
all you want to do now is to climb up on one of the benches and dance and sing with the crowd			0
usually , the tents are packed with people			1
so do n't be shy , just ask some people if you and your friends can join to their table			1
people are usually in a very good mood and very open			2
you wonder how many people meet the love of their life at the @entity9			2
to have the best time at the world 's biggest public festival , there are some useful tips			0
do n't wear @entity37 made of plastic or cloth			1
you will look like a tourist			2
if you want to buy traditional @entity37 , make sure that they are nearly too tight			1
on the third day of wearing them they will just be fine			0
and once you 've invested in the outfit , you can still use it for @entity150			0
make friends with the ladies delivering the beer			1
never be cheap with your tip , otherwise you might wait for your next beer for hours			1
and do get out of the way of the waitresses			0
they are very busy and will run you over			0
before drinking , it 's crucial that you say " @entity166 " and clink your mug while making eye contact with everyone at the table			0
@entity9 on a weekday is way more relaxed and much more fun			0
so if you do n't have to , do n't visit the @entity9 on a saturday			2
the whole place is packed with people and often the tents have to close because of the crowds			1
the beer at the @entity9 is much stronger than usual			2
so be careful that you eat loads before you start enjoying your beer , otherwise @entity9 might become an event you do n't even remember			1
make sure you bring plenty of cash because you ca n't pay for your beer with a credit card			1
there are @entity181 cash machines at the @entity9 but the lines can be long			0
a good tip to keep your belongings safe : put your money and valuables inside a money belt and frustrate pickpockets who sneak around			2
do n't try to get up on stage and sing with the band			2
it might sound strange to you but they actually do n't like it			2
last call at all the big beer tents is at 10.30pm , one hour before closing time			2
if you leave the @entity51 at 10pm you can avoid the people - traffic - jam on the way to the bus and train stations			2
also , @entity0 is very walkable			0
you can exercise by burning off some of the beer calories 7			2
after several ( or even one ) litres of beer you and everyone else in the tent start losing inhibitions , so it 's really easy to make new friends at @entity9			1
so once you 've found a seat at one of the tent 's tables and ordered a beer , do n't be shy -- introduce yourself to those around you			1
even when you go just by yourself , you 're going to have a blast			0
but smoking is banned in the tents			0
sleeping is the best way to keep your body fit -- not on the street or the sidewalk , though			1
go ahead and sleep your heart out at the place you 're staying			0
if you remind your body every now and then how it feels like to have more blood than alcohol running in your veins , your time at @entity9 will be a lot more fun			2
do n't miss the @entity51 parties			2
around the @entity232 and in the city plenty of clubs start the " @entity239 " right after closing the tents to make sure you can dance , party and have fun all night long			2
watch out for flyers and talk to locals 10			0
if you get sick , do n't do it close to the river because people might want to go surfing there			1
be sure you also take some time outside of the @entity9			0
there is plenty to do in @entity0			0
apart from the @entity6 river my favorite places are the campsite next to the @entity253 and the @entity255 beaches			2
breakfast at the @entity257 , a beautiful little square , is always a great way to start the day			0
to relax i go running or biking in the @entity260 , @entity0 's biggest park , or just hang out in on its huge meadow			0
i also like having " @entity269 " ( grilled fish ) with a fresh beer at the beergarden " @entity265 " or visiting the museums " @entity267 " and " @entity268 " ( perfect on a rainy afternoon )			2
another amazing spot is the castle " @entity272 " which will make you feel like you 're in a fairytale			0
just come by , take a long walk in the park of the beautiful castle and at the castle canal and see for yourself .			0

do n't wear @entity37 made of plastic or cloth . you will look like a tourist
make friends with the ladies delivering the beer , and never be cheap with your tip
sleeping is the best way to keep your body fit -- just not on the street or the sidewalk
if you get sick , do n't do it close to the river -- people surf there
