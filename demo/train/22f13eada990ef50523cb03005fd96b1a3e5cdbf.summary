@entity0 -- the full scale of @entity5 president @entity4 's new imperial ambition was revealed recently when he referred to the southern and eastern territories of @entity7 as @entity8 ( @entity8 )			1
this was the name given to the region by @entity12 after she captured it from the @entity14 in the late 18th century and began colonizing it with @entity5 , @entity7 and @entity17 settlers			1
along with his assertion that @entity22 belongs to @entity8 because of the blood - price @entity5 troops paid to conquer it more than two centuries ago , @entity4 's appropriation of @entity20 terminology establishes a new and troubling benchmark for his irredentist project			1
it suggests that all the territories that were once part of the @entity20 are now fair game			0
this concerns far more than the fate of @entity7			1
pushed to its logical conclusion , it poses a direct challenge to the legitimacy and independence of all post-soviet states			0
the practice of manipulating " frozen conflicts " and deploying @entity5 troops as " peacekeepers " in order to exert leverage is already well established in @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 , and there is an extensive toolbox of other coercive measures @entity52 is willing to apply , from trade embargoes to cyber attacks			1
while the scope of @entity5 territorial expansion is likely to be limited and the threat of military force mostly held in reserve , the ambition to subordinate the wider region under the aegis of the emerging @entity63 is absolutely clear			1
welcome to the new @entity20			0
events in @entity7 have left the @entity65 uncertain about how to respond			1
for all the talk of a new @entity68 , there is one important difference with the past that helps to explain why			0
whereas @entity72 communism defined its ideological purpose in terms of universal goals that posed a threat to the @entity65 , @entity4 emphasizes the exceptional character of @entity5 civilization and limits his vision to the domination of @entity81			1
his challenge is not of the existential variety that once forced @entity85 governments to set aside their differences in the face of a common enemy			0
it belongs instead to the realm of values where the @entity93 ideal of a " @entity95 whole and free " clashes with @entity4 's determination to build an exclusive sphere of influence in the east			1
it 's much harder to mobilize countries in defense of abstract principles rather than their own physical security , but that is what the @entity65 must do if it wants to prevent the unraveling of a @entity95 order based on democratic values			1
while some lessons of the @entity68 will be relevant , others will not			0
one idea that deserves qualified approval is containment , once more being talked about as the basis for @entity118 policy towards @entity8			2
this was the strategy adopted by the @entity122 administration at the onset of the @entity68 , designed to block @entity72 expansionism through a variety of military , economic and diplomatic countermeasures			2
the pledge @entity122 gave to " support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or outside pressures " is certainly relevant at a time when @entity5 troops are assembling on @entity7 's borders and their proxies are orchestrating violence inside the country			1
there is now an arc of countries stretching from the @entity141 to the borders of @entity143 with good reason to be concerned about the direction of @entity5 policy			1
many of them have large @entity5 minorities of their own			2
the @entity65 needs a comprehensive strategy for engaging with all of them			2
the states at risk fall into three distinct categories			0
the first is comprised of countries like @entity156 and the @entity157 that already enjoy the institutional security of belonging to @entity159 and the @entity63			2
the task here is to reinforce deterrence capabilities in order to prevent miscalculations on the part of @entity8			0
the second group , and probably the most significant , consists of vulnerable @entity85 countries , including @entity48 , @entity47 , @entity46 , and @entity7 itself , all of which now have @entity5 troops directly or indirectly involved in conflicts on their territory			1
@entity48 is particularly important as a strategic partner in helping to diversify @entity95 's energy supplies			2
the opening of the southern gas corridor with the addition of the @entity177 will provide substantial quantities of @entity48 gas by 2019 , thus weakening @entity8 's grip on the @entity95 market			2
all of these states are linked to @entity85 institutions through the @entity63 's @entity184 and @entity159 's @entity186 program			2
these need to be upgraded as a matter of priority , especially since full membership is not an immediate prospect			0
objectives should include deeper trade ties , structured political consultations and help in modernizing and strengthening their defensive capabilities			0
ultimately , @entity85 countries must be willing to extend explicit security guarantees , preferably within the @entity159 framework , but outside it if necessary			0
engagement with the third group of countries -- authoritarian post-soviet states including @entity205 , @entity206 and the other @entity208 republics -- may seem like a waste of time given the support some of them gave @entity52 after the seizure of @entity22			0
but much of this support will have been offered out of fear rather than genuine approval			0
just as @entity68 containment involved engagement with communist countries , such as @entity143 and @entity222 , willing to depart from the @entity52 line , its modern counterpart should aim to disrupt @entity4 's coercive alliance building strategy at every opportunity			1
there is , however , one important sense in which neo-containment should differ from its @entity68 predecessor			0
although its architect , @entity230 , always hoped that it would be used to modify @entity72 behavior , containment in practice became part of a zero - sum struggle in which there could only be one survivor			0
the aim of containment today should not be to engineer @entity8 's collapse , but to block the illegitimate exercise of power and encourage @entity5 leaders to pursue their interests by respecting the sovereign equality of their neighbors			1
in the long - term , @entity8 would be stronger not weaker as a result			0

the scale of @entity5 president @entity4 's imperial ambitions revealed , @entity260 says
but events in @entity7 have left the @entity65 uncertain about how to respond , he writes
there are an arc of countries with good reason to be concerned about @entity5 policy
policy of containment must be used to block the illegitimate exercise of power
