when asked if the unprovoked attack was tied to terrorism or to recent calls by radicals to attack military and police officers , @entity16 said , " there is nothing we know as of this time that would indicate that were the case , " and a senior law enforcement official told @entity55 on friday that investigators do not believe that @entity28 , a @entity57 convert , was driven by any radical @entity59 views			1
nevertheless , @entity16 acknowledged concern because of recent attacks on uniformed officers			2

it 's not the only city so affected			0
