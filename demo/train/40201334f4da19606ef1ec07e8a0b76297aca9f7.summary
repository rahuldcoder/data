@entity0 pledged friday to reform its governance structure after the corruption scandals which rocked football 's world governing body last year			1
proposed changes to its ethics committee , which will be split into two entities , one to investigate allegations and another to rule on them , were hailed as " historic " by @entity0 president @entity11 after being approved by the executive committee			1
they will still need to be endorsed by @entity0 's 2012 @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 in may			0
@entity0 was responding to a report of the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) , chaired by @entity20 professor @entity19 and made public friday			2
it was commissioned after @entity22 football chief @entity21 was banned from the game for life after being found guilty of corruption for trying to buy votes in the @entity0 presidential election with $ 40,000 cash inducements to @entity30 football officials			2
the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 @entity32 , respectively won by @entity33 and @entity34 , also came under scrutiny after allegations of improper conduct			1
@entity19 and the eight - strong @entity38 branded as " unsatisfactory " @entity0 's past handling of the corruption allegations			1
" existing procedures are insufficient to meet the challenges of a major global sport governing body , " the @entity38 found			0
it went on " this has led to unsatisfactory reactions to persistent allegations			0
" in some instances , allegations were insufficiently investigated and where sanctions were imposed , they are at times insufficient and clearly unconvincing			0
" @entity11 told a press conference in @entity52 friday that his organization recognized the need for change			0
" the executive committee unanimously agreed to this new approach in our efforts for more transparency and integrity , " he said			0
" the new ethics committee will have the possibility to initiate investigation in the case of credible allegations			1
" but @entity67 , a senior writer for @entity68 , who unsuccessfully tried to challenge @entity11 in the @entity0 presidential elections last year , told @entity71 that while the 76 - year - old @entity20 remained at the helm there would be doubts about the implementation of the proposed changes			1
" @entity11 came to power 14 years ago through an election where he had the support of executive members who are now disgraced so he has very little credibility in preaching for reform , " he said			0
@entity67 was also disappointed that the @entity38 had stopped short of calling for further investigation into the award of the 2018 and @entity85 host countries			2
" my big concern is that there is no recommendation to do a forensic investigation into 2018 and 2022 bidding process because it was clearly not satisfactory in many people 's eyes , " he said			1
@entity67 also doubted @entity0 would implement the @entity38 recommendation to limit the terms of @entity0 president and executive committee members to two terms of four years			1
" term limits are a really important change , it would keep some of these dinosaurs from sitting on the committee for years and years , " he said			0
@entity0 also agreed friday to co-opt its entire executive committee onto the organizing body of the @entity104 after concerns that preparations in @entity107 have fallen behind schedule			2
2010 @entity85 chief @entity110 @entity109 has also been named as an adviser along with @entity113 , who is overseeing the 2018 tournament in @entity33			2
a @entity0 statement said : " to underline the significance of the @entity117 for world football 's governing body , the complete @entity0 executive committee is now , for the first time , part of this decision - making forum which is responsible for monitoring and organizing each edition of @entity0 's flagship event			0
