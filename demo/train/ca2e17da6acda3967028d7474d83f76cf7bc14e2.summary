but police investigator @entity35 told the court wednesday that @entity11 , 26 , was n't acting in self - defense when he shot through the door of a toilet room in the bathroom of his home and killed @entity14			1
@entity35 said he believes @entity11 knew @entity14 was on the other side of the door			1
he did n't explain why investigators think that but suggested @entity11 was specifically aiming to hit the toilet where @entity14 had gone			1
but he also said investigators have found no evidence that is inconsistent with @entity11 ' story			1
@entity11 ' affidavit in alleged murder of girlfriend bail hearing prosecutors spent much of the hearing wednesday focused on the bathroom of @entity11 ' @entity57 home , where authorities say the track star shot @entity14 three times , in the hip , elbow and ear			1
bullet trajectories show that @entity11 had to turn left and fire at an angle to aim at the toilet , @entity35 testified			2
had he fired head - on into the door , he would have missed her , @entity35 said			0
defense attorney @entity71 disputed that , saying the evidence does not show there was an effort to aim at the toilet			0
prosecutors are trying to prove @entity11 intentionally fired on @entity14 , 29 , in a premeditated attempt to kill her			1
@entity11 and his lawyers argue he mistook her for an intruder and killed her accidentally			2
@entity11 said in a statement read tuesday by his lawyer that he believes @entity14 slipped into the bathroom when he got up to close the balcony door in his bedroom in the early hours of february 14			1
hearing noises and gripped with fear that someone had broken into his home , @entity11 said he grabbed his gun , yelled for the intruder to leave and shot through the toilet - room door before realizing the person inside might have been @entity14			1

@entity35 also said police believe a blood - stained cricket bat found in the bathroom was used to break down the locked door to the toilet			2
@entity11 said in his statement that he used the bat to break down the door in an effort to get to @entity14 to help her			1
@entity35 agreed with the defense contention that , other than the bullet wounds , her body showed no sign of an assault or efforts to defend herself			0
but prosecutors and @entity11 ' defense battled over allegations that testosterone and needles were found at the home , as well as the quality of the police investigation			1
opinion : what my son taught me about @entity11 investigative errors ? amid speculation by outsiders to the case that steroids or other drugs could have somehow played a role in the shooting , @entity35 testified that investigators found two boxes of testosterone and needles at @entity11 ' home			1
under questioning by @entity71 , however , @entity35 said he had n't read the full name of the substance -- which @entity71 said was an herbal remedy called testoconpasupium coenzyme -- when investigators took the materials into evidence			2
a quick internet search on the name of the substance yielded no results			0
he also said the defense forensics team found a bullet in the toilet that police had missed and noted police had failed to find out who owned ammunition found at the home or photograph it			1
investigators also went into @entity11 ' home without wearing protective foot covers to prevent contamination of the crime scene , @entity71 said			1
@entity35 conceded that was true and said it was because police did n't have any more of the covers left			0
@entity71 questioned police arguments that a witness heard sounds of an argument before the shooting			2
the witness , @entity71 said , lives 600 meters ( more than a third of a mile ) from @entity11 ' home			1

police said the second incident took place at a racetrack , where @entity11 allegedly threatened to assault someone			1
authorities have also said they have responded to previous domestic incidents at @entity11 ' home , but have not elaborated			1
in his statement tuesday , @entity11 said he and @entity14 were deeply in love and said he was " mortified " over her death			1
high hurdle defense attorneys are trying to overcome @entity202 law , which makes it difficult for defendants accused of premeditated murder to get out on bail			2
the law requires evidence of " exceptional circumstances " to justify release			0
@entity178 upgraded the charge against @entity11 to premeditated murder tuesday , saying he could not rule out the possibility that the track star planned @entity14 's death			1
but @entity178 said he would consider downgrading the charge later			0
in a statement read by his lawyer tuesday , @entity11 said he would not try to flee or influence any witnesses if he is allowed out on bail , and he said his release would n't be a danger to public order			1

i mean , we know @entity14			2
and if @entity14 was happy , everything was ok ... and everything was good , then everything was normal			2
" @entity14 said he never spoke to his half - sister about @entity11 , and she did n't discuss the relationship much -- if at all -- with anyone in the family			1
so , without any in - depth knowledge , his family keeps vacillating about what the evidence suggests happened , he said			2
" at a time like this , when people are grieving , i think it 's hard to keep a clear mind on anything , " @entity14 said			2
" and with the added pressure and the media coverage and the interest , you know , from the world looking into this story , it 's a rather unnatural situation			0
so , i suppose i would agree with everyone is flipping from one side to the other			0
we just do n't know			0
you know , all that we want is we want to know what the truth is , and i think that 's what everyone else would like as well			2
you know , to be able to make something of this -- to be able to deal with this and have something positive come out of this			0
" @entity14 said the worst is over			0
" we are all holding up very well considering the circumstances			0
we 've now had just about a week to let things sink in			0
