-- for nearly 50 years @entity1 and @entity2 have been filming sharks at close quarters , bringing the lives of the ocean 's most fearsome predators to tv and the big screen			1
@entity1 , 76 , was a spear fisherman before he and @entity2 started working with film and tv companies who wanted shark dramas			1
the conflict of hunting one day , then capturing the underwater life with a 16mm camera the next , led @entity1 to forsake spear hunting for full - time filming			2
getting close to sharks , including the few species dangerous to humans , has put the @entity23 couple in treacherous situations			1
one of the most perilous came in 1969 when the couple had to fend off a school of sharks off the coast of @entity29 while filming them feast on a dead whale			1
@entity2 has also been bitten three times , yet despite the hazards of the job both remain in awe of sharks and committed to their protection			1
they blame the voracious appetite of people for shark fins for endangering many shark species			1
" world wide sharks are in serious danger , mainly for shark finning , " @entity2 told @entity0			1
" the @entity47 market just ca n't get enough of sharks fin ; the price has gone way up			0
even @entity23 fishermen are taking shark fins now in the @entity52			1
" some species of sharks are protected , like the @entity55 ... but with other species of sharks there are no restrictions			2
" the @entity60 hope their captivating underwater footage has helped educate people that sharks deserve respect and protection			0
however they admit that some of their work may have been viewed as adding to the negative image that sharks are dangerous			0
" to some extent the documentaries perpetuate the myth , because they see people with sharks , but whenever you see documentaries with divers in the water and sharks around , those sharks have been attracted with bait , " said @entity2			2
the couple filmed the live shot for 1975 film " @entity84 " and did not expect their work would have the affect of almost scaring a generation from swimming in the sea			1
" the problem was that [ " jaws " ] was so well done that people believed that the sharks really were like that , that there was a vendetta against sharks and @entity2 and i got a lot of criticism ... the number of people learning to dive dropped off			0
so the dive shops were very unhappy about @entity2 and i being involved in a film that reduced their commercial possibilities			0
" yet the @entity105 remain committed to raising awareness of the importance of marine biodiversity and shark protection			2
" you 've just got to tell your story well and have good imagery			0
and you can make a big difference to the way not only the government but the people on the country can view their marine wilderness areas , which should be looked at the same as national parks on land , " said @entity2			0
@entity2 added : " we really need no - take zones where marine creatures have a chance to reproduce unmolested and the fishermen do n't want it			0
the want to be able to take fish from everywhere			0
we need marine national parks with no - take zones			0
