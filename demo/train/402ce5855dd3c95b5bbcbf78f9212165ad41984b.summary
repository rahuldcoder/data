-- a prominent @entity2 rights activist controversially detained by his government under anti-terror laws says he believes his arrest was partly spurred by an international push to independently investigate the country 's human rights record following decades of civil war			1
@entity10 , one of his country 's leading human rights activists , was arrested late sunday night with fellow activist rev. @entity13 , a @entity14 priest , in the former @entity16 rebel stronghold of @entity17 in the country 's north			1
the men were taken to the @entity22 headquarters of @entity2 's @entity23 , held for more than 48 hours and questioned , without access to lawyers , before being released early monday			1
" i think it 's a deliberate attempt to intimidate and suppress any form of dissent , criticism or challenge , and clearly not allow people outside @entity2 to know what 's happening inside the country , " @entity10 told @entity0 after his release			2
" i anticipate that i will be subject to greater scrutiny and i am extremely worried about the safety and wellbeing of my colleagues and people i 've spoken to in the past			0
" the arrests drew a wave of condemnation from @entity43 and foreign governments , with @entity46 foreign office minister @entity45 saying they were " not acceptable " and the @entity49 embassy expressing concern			1
@entity51 of the @entity46 - based @entity52 said the invocation of anti-terror laws was " outrageous " and " patently absurd			1
" " they 're peace activists , " he said			0
proposed resolution the arrests occurred in the build - up to a crucial session of the @entity61 @entity60 this month , at which a resolution sponsored by the @entity49 , @entity46 and other countries is expected to be tabled			1
the proposed resolution could call for an independent international investigation into war crimes committed by government forces and @entity16 separatists during @entity2 's 26 - year civil war , which ended in 2009 , as well as more recent alleged government abuses in the five years since its end			2
the council has passed two previous resolutions urging @entity2 to investigate war crimes , but its perceived failure to do so has led some nations to call for an independent investigation			0
@entity2 police spokesman @entity77 said @entity10 faced three charges : selling information abroad , attempting to damage the national harmony between communities , and aiding and abetting the rebuilding of the @entity83 -- the brutal militant group involved in fighting for a @entity16 homeland in the north of the country during the decades - long civil war			2
the investigation had found insufficient evidence to proceed with the charges			0
@entity10 said the first two charges , which appeared to relate to his work with foreign media to highlight rights abuses , suggested that their arrest was motivated in strong part by the impending events in @entity99			0
" i think what happened to us is very much linked to the resolution discussion , " he said			0
" i was repeatedly asked who in @entity99 , who outside @entity2 , was i sharing information with ? it seemed very clear they took great care for other nations not to hear any alternative information or perspectives from within @entity2			0
" ' attempt to intimidate ' @entity51 said that , beyond the @entity2 government 's " thumbing its nose at @entity99 , " the arrests amounted to an attempt to intimidate those working to expose human rights abuses in post-war @entity2			1
" i think this is about sending a warning to human rights defenders that just because @entity99 is going their way they have n't won , and more importantly showing them that they can not interface with @entity61 processes without suffering consequences			1
so if an investigation is established , they better not testify			0
" but @entity77 denied that there was any attempt to intimidate or punish those involved in activism around the @entity61 resolution			0
he said the activists had been arrested after visiting a place of interest relating to the shooting of a policeman in the @entity17 area last week			2
@entity10 , a @entity14 from the country 's @entity141 majority , denies any connection to the shooting or those responsible			0
he said he and @entity13 , a @entity16 , had gone to investigate the facts surrounding the arrest of another activist in relation to the shooting , in the regular course of their human rights work			1
the activist , @entity154 , became a prominent campaigner against political disappearances after her teen son , who had been conscripted to fight for the @entity83 , went missing after reportedly surrendering at the end of the war			0
she was arrested friday on suspicion of harboring @entity160 , a @entity83 - affiliated figure also known as " @entity161 , " after he shot and wounded a policeman as authorities closed in on her house , according to a @entity2 government memo to the @entity61 @entity10 denied any connection to @entity167			1
mixed fortunes the end of @entity2 's civil war has been a boon to its economy , paving the way for infrastructure reconstruction and the return of tourists , and bolstering president @entity178 's popularity			0
but activists are calling on the international community to pay attention to conditions in tamil - majority areas in the north and east of the country			0
a large military presence is at the heart of complaints of ongoing land expropriation , disappearances , sexual violations , arbitrary arrests and limitations on the freedom of movement , according to rights groups			1
meanwhile an ongoing " @entity204 " process -- in which the @entity198 culture and places of worship of the @entity141 were replacing the @entity202 landscape of @entity16 areas -- was a serious concern , as was growing hostility towards @entity207 and @entity209 minorities , according to a joint memorandum submitted by civil society groups to the @entity61 earlier this month			2
in a report in february , the @entity212 of the @entity61 's @entity213 acknowledged @entity2 's progress made in implementing some of the recommendations of the @entity216 , its national mechanism for post-war reconciliation			2
but it noted the government had failed to ensure independent and credible investigations into past violations , and noted ongoing attacks on religious minorities and intimidation of human rights activists , lawyers and journalists .			1

two @entity2 human rights activists held under anti-terror laws have been released
their arrests were condemned by the @entity49 , @entity46 and international rights groups
police say they were held after visiting addresses of interest in connection to a police shooting
one of the men believes the arrests are linked to a push to condemn @entity2 at the @entity61
