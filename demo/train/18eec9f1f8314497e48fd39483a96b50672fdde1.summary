@entity0 -- the former @entity3 prime minister , sir @entity2 , has credited the @entity4 and @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 , with reinvigorating interest in the @entity3 monarchy			1
speaking about the couple 's wedding last year he told @entity1 : " it was a truly lovely day and i think the whole world saw that			1
and of course , that helps			0
" @entity2 also acted as a guardian for prince @entity6 's interests after his mother died and maintains close links with the monarchy			1
in 2005 he was made a @entity21 which is the highest honor the @entity23 can bestow			0
@entity2 told @entity1 : " people see that iconic figures -- whom they see only at a distance and they perhaps never meet -- have the same emotions , same feelings , the same cares , the same loves that they have in their own lives			1
i think the @entity33 has communicated that better in the last couple of decades than perhaps at any earlier time in our history and it has had an impact			0
" @entity2 notes how prince @entity6 in particular has helped modernize the family 's image : " people are very happy with the way he has risen to the challenges he faced and i think even more than that , they see him as a very human individual and i think that is very important			1
" @entity6 is a search and rescue pilot for the @entity51 and must decide soon if he wants to stay on in the service for another three years			2
" i think his service career is something that matters a very great deal to him , as it does to @entity56			0
so i think he is well aware of the responsibilities that lie ahead but there 's a greater freedom these days for members of the @entity33 to pursue their own lives than perhaps there has been sometimes in the past and in the case of prince @entity6 , he 's pursuing that in terms of his military career , " @entity2 said			1
and what of the newest addition to the royal family ? " i think that @entity7 has been faultless so far and i think the whole world has seen that , " says @entity2			1
a royal source told @entity1 last month that @entity23 has given the @entity5 a lot of time as she settles in to the family			1
@entity2 adds : " of course she wants her grandson and her grandson 's wife to be successful and of course she offers help and they 'd be foolish not to take it			2
now plainly , one can , even looking from the outside , see what a good relationship actually exists there and one forgets sometimes			0
" the former prime minister says the @entity7 has handled the pressure of her high profile brilliantly			2
" it is n't easy -- suddenly to find yourself the focus of world attention , to find whatever you do is the subject of publicity , whatever you wear is the subject of comment			0
it 's not easy at all			2
it 's a tremendous imposition suddenly			2
it takes a lot to get used to but she has very good advice and i think she has handled it as well as it could possibly have been handled			0
" when i asked the former prime minister if she was a natural , her replied : " oh i think she 's a natural			0
do n't you ? "			0
