-- @entity1 , the comeback story like no other -- the nation 's largest ongoing rehabilitation project not named @entity6 -- makes his postseason splash sunday night			1
a bigger audience means more fans than ever face this question : can i embrace the @entity14 quarterback 's singular talents without getting the blood of past sins on me ? it 's been more than 19 months since @entity1 's release from federal prison in @entity20 , @entity21 , on his dogfighting conviction			1
and still the debate over his crime and his place back at the forefront of the @entity27 achieves spectacular extremes			1
within two days in late december , the president of the @entity30 congratulated @entity32 owner @entity31 for giving @entity1 a second chance while a @entity35 analyst suggested that @entity1 should have been executed for his crime			1
but this process of redemption also works itself out quietly , modestly , one oil change at a time			2
a @entity40 dealer in @entity41 , @entity42 , has a played a small role in reintroducing @entity1 to the segment of society that does n't kill dogs for sport			2
@entity48 , executive manager of the dealership , was the first businessman to sign the ex-con qb to an endorsement deal			2
before the feds started digging around @entity1 's @entity53 in @entity54 , he was the hottest property in the league , making a reported $ 7 million a year in endorsements			1
afterward , he was an untouchable			2
now , for a series of promotional appearances and one television spot , he reportedly is receiving the free use of a $ 50,000 @entity62			2
" when we first met , he was n't ashamed to admit that he did wrong and was wrong , " @entity48 said			2
would you buy a car from @entity1 ? @entity48 said the response has been mostly positive			2
" we have gotten some phone calls from people saying , ' we 'll never buy a car from you again , ' but a lot of those came from out of town , from people who would n't buy here anyway			2
" to help ease the expected criticism , the dealership struck a promotional arrangement in which it would donate to the local humane society for every car sold until the end of january			2
@entity48 estimates the total should amount to $ 10,000			2
one episode last month struck the manager as telling			0
a customer came to him irate over how long it had taken the service department to perform a simple oil change			0
he left dramatically , vowing never to return			0
the next day , @entity48 's phone rang			1
it was the same disaffected customer			0
he had seen the @entity1 commercial that night			0
" you gave @entity1 a second chance , and i 'm willing to give your store a second chance " are the words @entity48 remembers			0
@entity100 has always had its gamblers and rogues , its cheats and addicts			0
in one @entity107 night in @entity108 , @entity106 linebacker @entity105 became part of a double murder case ( he eventually pleaded to misdemeanor obstruction of justice )			0
the following year , 2001 , he was the @entity113			0
there 'd be none of the usual failings for @entity1 , though			0
like his skill set of speed , elusiveness and arm strength , his downfall had to be so out of the norm as to challenge belief			0
he 'd bankroll a dog fighting ring			1
the cruelty of @entity1 's crime was spelled out in unsettling detail in the indictment against him , in passages such as : " in or about april 2007 ( @entity133 ) peace , ( @entity131 ) @entity130 and @entity1 executed approximately eight dogs that did not perform well in " testing " sessions by various methods including hanging , drowning and slamming at least one dog 's body to the ground			1
" and the price he paid for his crime was steep : 23 months in prison , three years probation , bankruptcy and great heapings of public scorn			1
but fans love a good comeback story , and they are quick to grant forgiveness to those who lead them back to the top of the standings			1
now , with @entity1 , they are being asked to process an entirely foreign kind of crime along with a startling kind of ability			0
it 's like trying to read a @entity161 tragedy -- in @entity161			1
after serving as a backup with the @entity32 in 2009 , @entity1 took over the starting role early this season			1
the team had shed its longtime marquee quarterback , @entity166 , with plans of plugging in @entity168 as his successor			1
but @entity168 suffered a concussion , and @entity1 rediscovered his @entity171			0
at 30 , he appeared to be a star at peak brightness			0
against @entity174 in november , he put on such a show -- passing for four touchdowns and rushing for two others -- that the @entity178 requested his jersey			0
he threw for more than 300 yards three times in a month			0
( during six seasons in @entity108 , he had done that only twice			0
) throwing for a career - high 21 touchdowns , with only six interceptions , he was 8 - 3 as an @entity32 starter and led them to a division title			1
on sunday , versus @entity187 , @entity1 returns to the site of his last playoff appearance , this time leading the home team at @entity14 's @entity191			1
it has been seven eventful years since he last played the postseason			1
and that was a largely forgettable performance , the @entity195 losing in the 2003 @entity197 championship by 17 and their quarterback rendered practically invisible			1
he enters this game with an injured leg , and his last start , a loss to @entity203 , was his least productive of the season			0
but it 's so much more than the numbers with @entity1 ; it 's how he amasses them			1
@entity208 , @entity1 's first coach in @entity108 and an unabashed supporter , is an old - school , understated football lifer			1
but on the subject of @entity1 , he raves : " ( @entity1 's ) just exciting			1
i love what @entity214 and @entity215 and @entity216 do			1
they are great at what they do ; i love to watch them , but @entity223 takes your breath away			1
" you watch him and you say , ' how did he get away from that guy ; how did he make that deep throw ; how did he throw across his body like that ? ' " by all accounts , @entity1 has dedicated himself to the craft of his position as never before			0
in interviews now , he sounds markedly more clear - headed than during his @entity108 days			0
he has struck all the right notes thus far this season , including dedicating himself to regular appearances on behalf of the anti-dog fighting campaign of the @entity238			1
that cause has benefited even from those wishing @entity1 ill. a pair of @entity187 fans this season pledged $ 10 to the @entity244 for every time the quarterback was sacked			1
the total currently stands at $ 340			0
@entity27 commissioner @entity247 told the @entity248 , " this young man has turned his life around , and he 's going to contribute			1
" while @entity1 never can outrun his past , there are signs that he has begun to at least give it a good race			1
nowhere has the @entity1 conversation been more divisive than in @entity108 , where he was the franchise 's no. 1 overall draft pick in 2001			1
his rise lifted the @entity195 profile nationally and titillated the fan base like no other player , including @entity263			0
and his fall absolutely laid waste to the franchise for two seasons			0
@entity268 , co-host of morning sports talk on @entity108 's 790 @entity270 , has found himself moderating the debate over @entity1 's standing among @entity195 fans			1
it often swings between vitriol and blind adoration , seeming to break down frequently along racial lines			0
" i never thought i 'd see the light at the end of that tunnel			0
but i do sense that there is a turn ( in the tone of the conversation ) , " @entity268 said			0
" most people now are playing the good - for - him , give - him - a - second - chance card , " he added			1
" he was stupidity personified			0
he paid the price ; now let 's move on			1
people like a redemption story			1
" of course , if the @entity195 were n't 13 - 3 now , there might be a heck of a lot more venom than there is now			0
" @entity1 's past and present teams may be on a collision course for an nfc championship game meeting in @entity108 , at which time the old scab will be ripped clean off			2
deciding on how to deal with @entity1 here at center stage would be so much easier if only there were a porthole to his soul , allowing a peek at what 's really in there			2
how can any fan know ? @entity1 's road to fan acceptance is the same one that will take him to a new contract ; his two - year deal ( which with bonuses and incentives have earned him a reported $ 7 million ) runs out this season			2
he seems to realize the practical truth that what he does is going to amount to much more than what he utters			0
he recently told @entity322 , " i do n't think me saying the right thing is going to get me a new deal			0
it 's all about my play			2
it 's all about how you conduct yourself as you play well			2
i do n't have to put on a front around anybody			0
" the idea that people can change -- that 's the notion @entity334 's life is built around			2
" if it was my belief that people were static , i do n't think i could come to work every day , " says the president and ceo of the @entity238			0
@entity1 is just one of a number of former dog fighters and animal abusers that @entity342 's group has enlisted as spokesmen against cruelty			1
@entity1 has made a dozen appearances in major cities in the @entity347 , attempting to reach youngsters who could be lured into the practice of pitting dogs against each other in back alleys and abandoned buildings , so - called " street fighting			1
" @entity334 said he has been asked a thousand times whether he believes @entity1 is sincere			0
asked for the 1,001st time , he said , " i do n't get into that			0
" all he knows for sure is that he has seen @entity1 speak to hundreds of youngsters who , because of the quarterback 's status , " sit and listen in rapt attention			1
" will the head of the @entity244 be rooting for the one - time dog fighter this weekend ? @entity342 is one of the very few who remain mute on that subject .			2
