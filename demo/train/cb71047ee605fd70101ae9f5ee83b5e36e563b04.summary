-- can - do founder @entity1 spent most of 2010 in @entity2 helping people recover from the devastating earthquake			1
as he returns to @entity2 in 2011 , his first stop will be at an orphanage that his charity helped rebuild last year			1
the 50 children there call him " @entity10			2
" the orphanage is completely out of food and resources			2
" when you get out there , it is again the first day of the disaster -- it is like you are there for the first time , " @entity1 said			1
" the need is still so great -- the disaster is not over , and in some ways it is just getting worse			2
" " why do i do it ? anger and frustration			2
if it was your kids , and you were in the same situation , you are going to do whatever you can			2
you are not going to stop			0
and for the aid workers , the @entity2 people have become family and we are emotionally invested , so we will see it through			1
" for all the efforts of aid workers , @entity2 is still struggling with tattered tent cities , scarce basic necessities , and a cholera epidemic that has killed more than 3,000 people			1
" it is hard to go back , " @entity1 said			1
" people are out there , risking their lives and trying to make a difference , but they are limited , and for many the funding is gone			0
there is so much to do in @entity2 that it is overwhelming			1
" and while donors , and prospective donors , are frustrated with the results of the dollars they sent in the wake of the quake , @entity1 is frustrated too			1
" i do n't want to say nothing has been done , and you do n't want to take away from the groups that are out there , trying their hardest to make a difference , " @entity1 said , " but where is the master plan ? people are dying			1
people are running out of time			0
" according to @entity1 , nongovernment organizations working in @entity2 are mostly responsible for slow progress , and he encourages donors to hold them accountable			1
but the @entity2 election and resulting political turmoil have delayed the launching of much - needed recovery projects , he said			1
" we have supplies right now with @entity2 's customs , still being processed , which was originally sent over there , and needed there , more than three weeks ago " @entity1 said			1
" it discourages you when they are in total desperation and they look at you as the person to help them -- and your hands are tied			0
you ca n't get the stuff out and you go back to them empty - handed , and it is the worst feeling in the world			0
" despite aid worker frustrations , @entity89 , president and ceo of the @entity91 , has seen improvement			1
during the earthquake , roughly 4,000 schools in and around @entity95 were destroyed			2
by the end of 2010 , @entity97 had completed 57 semipermanent schools , with another 70 under construction			0
it has also re-equipped 2,000 temporary schools with learning materials such as backpacks , blackboards and furniture			0
@entity108 's greatest encouragement is the children 's crisp white uniforms			1
" a month ago i was awed by 40 schoolgirls at a semipermanent school , who were wearing spotless white school uniforms , " she said			2
" most of these girls are still living in tents , but every day they scrubbed their shirts , stretched them to remove wrinkles , folded them tightly to their textbook and placed them under their mattress			0
if this is what their future means to them , who am i to give up and say no ? " her frustration with donor fatigue is that it has turned into an intellectual debate , weighing donations and speed of progress			0
@entity108 said this debate ignores the fact that these are people , and their lives are in the balance			0
" i do n't want @entity137 to stop from asking these tough questions , because they have to keep all of us on the ball			0
i just want them to understand that the option to stop helping @entity2 , while we address those questions , is that people will die , " @entity108 said			1
this additional crisis of cholera in @entity2 is being met by organizations already dealing with exhausted volunteers , donor fatigue and doubt			1
" we are really stretched right now in our own capacity , and we are making a call to other organizations to step up response			0
" said @entity157 , development director for @entity158			0
thus far , @entity158 has treated 84,500 people suffering from cholera , and the group does not see an end to the epidemic on the immediate horizon			2
@entity165 has also issued an urgent call for medical professionals to volunteer in @entity2			1
in addition to volunteers , the group needs financial support to continue to provide medical supplies			0
it has sent 10 planeloads full of these supplies , but the supplies are barely keeping pace with the need			2
" it can take 24 bags of iv solution , eight bags a day for three days , per person			0
if you then look at thousands of people affected , you can see the overwhelming need			0
" said @entity187 of @entity165			0
she understands the frustration donors feel , and said the slow progress weighs heavy on the aid workers as well			1
" it hits your heart , to see more suffering on top of suffering			0
we are working such long hours , and you just try to focus on what is being done , and hold the hand of the mom who is scared her baby is going to die , and you reassure her and tackle the task at hand -- you focus on that , and that is what keeps you going , " said @entity187 .			0
