@entity0 -- backpacking across @entity3 in 1981 as a young man fresh out of @entity5 , @entity2 found what he called " a country of contrasts , where bullock carts would take supplies into nuclear power stations			1
" now the man who opinion polls predict will be @entity13 's next prime minister after the september 7 national election is prepared to see those power stations run on @entity13 uranium -- a position that goes down well in @entity18			0
@entity2 , a religious man whose time in @entity3 included six weeks at the @entity13 @entity20 mission in @entity21 , leads the conservative liberal - national opposition that is locked in a struggle for power with @entity25 , led by @entity2 's political rival and incumbent @entity13 prime minister , @entity27			1
@entity28 announces new elections for september 7 uranium is the key energy commodity that differentiates how @entity27 and @entity2 approach relations with @entity3			1
on paper , a bipartisan position @entity13 , which has about a third of the world 's recoverable low - cost uranium resources , sells the nuclear fuel to @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , the @entity43 , @entity44 and the @entity45 , but not so far to @entity3			1
how @entity13 political rivals view @entity39 both the @entity25 and @entity48 parties have a policy that they will sell @entity13 uranium to energy - starved @entity3			1
so on paper , it looks like a bipartisan position			0
but @entity27 is a reluctant helmsman for his party 's policy , believing @entity3 must accept stringent conditions before it gets @entity13 uranium for its power plants			1
in his first stint as prime minister in 2007 - 2010 , he was adamant that because @entity3 was not a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , uranium sales to it were precluded			1
he said this was not a policy directed against @entity3 , but one that applied globally			0
when @entity68 , the deputy prime minister who overthrew @entity27 for the leadership in june 2010 ( before herself being ousted in june this year by @entity27 ) , decided to push through a @entity25 policy change on the uranium issue in late 2011 , @entity27 was not consulted			2
@entity27 has said that @entity3 does not need to source uranium from @entity13			1
it gets most of its supply now from @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78			0
@entity2 's @entity3 ambitions in contrast , @entity2 is happy to see @entity13 uranium shipped to @entity3 nuclear power plants			1
at the @entity83 in @entity0 last year , he said : " yes , we will sell uranium to @entity3 because we know that @entity3 is one of the world 's great democracies			1
" in reality , any uranium sales are years away , so the @entity13 - @entity3 nuclear trade is more symbolic than substantial			1
@entity18 views it as a touchstone for the state of the bilateral relationship			0
in march this year , the first official - level talks were held on a civil nuclear cooperation agreement that is the first step towards uranium sales			0
a prerequisite is an undertaking by @entity3 that it will not use @entity13 uranium in any weapons - related capacity			1
when @entity27 addressed the @entity104 in @entity18 in november 2009 , he harked back to his days at @entity106 's @entity105 , where he studied @entity3 civilization and its impact on @entity39			2
but @entity27 's primary focus has always been @entity39			0
he is a @entity39 speaker , a former diplomat in @entity111 and a lifelong student of all things @entity39			0
for his part , @entity2 , a @entity114 at @entity115 , maintains that if he becomes prime minister he will take @entity3 seriously , " as i have always done			2
" @entity39 ' not the only superpower ' in an address to the @entity120 in @entity0 last december , @entity2 said that as prime minister he would treat @entity3 as one of the key countries helping to shape the future of @entity13 and the wider world			1
" it 's important to note that @entity39 is not the only emerging superpower of @entity133 , " @entity2 said , pointing to the quadrupling of @entity3 's gross domestic product ( gdp ) in two decades and high economic growth rates			1
" what 's more , @entity3 is the emerging democratic superpower of @entity133 , and also the emerging @entity137 - speaking super power			2
as far as i am concerned , this means it should never be the emerging superpower that 's taken for granted or neglected			2
" @entity2 said @entity3 fell into all three categories of countries that were particularly important to @entity13 : " our neighbors , our major trading partners and our key strategic allies			1
" he said that by 2050 , @entity3 was forecast to be the world 's most populous nation			0
" unlike @entity39 , which is tipped to grow old before its citizens grow rich , @entity3 is tipped to grow rich before it goes gray			0
" @entity13 - @entity3 relations in general , relations between @entity13 and @entity3 are good , up from a low point in 2009 - 10 when the uranium issue and a series of attacks on @entity156 students in @entity157 sparked heated discussion			1
@entity3 in some years is the largest source of new immigrants to @entity13 , and @entity3 student numbers continue to be strong			2
trade and investment flows are increasing -- @entity3 is now @entity13 's fourth biggest export market , taking mainly coal , gold and copper , and it has made substantial investments in @entity13 's mining sector			2
a " strategic partnership " launched in november 2009 by @entity27 during his meeting with the @entity3 prime minister @entity174 was given a further push by @entity68 during her visit to @entity3 in october 2012			2
negotiations for a free trade agreement began in 2011 and reached a fifth round of talks in @entity106 in may			0
no @entity3 prime minister has visited @entity13 since @entity180 in 1986			0
since then , six @entity13 prime ministerial visits to @entity3 have taken place			0
@entity174 was invited to the @entity183 ( @entity183 ) held in @entity184 in october 2011 , but sent vice president @entity185 instead			0
in the view of some political observers , @entity174 's no - show reflected annoyance over the uranium issue			0
there is also a sense that @entity13 strategically is not really all that important to @entity3 , which must contend with a neighborhood made up of @entity39 , @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 and @entity197			0
in contrast , @entity3 ranks as a top - five priority for @entity13 in @entity133 , along with @entity39 , @entity200 , @entity40 and @entity41			2
if @entity2 wins office on september 7 , expect @entity13 to give even more priority to @entity3			1
if @entity27 retains office , it will be a case of " steady as she goes			0
" ahead of his last visit to @entity3 in 2009 , @entity27 noted that like most of @entity13 's relationships , the one with @entity3 " has some bumps in the road " occasionally			1
" but we can work our way through them , " he said			0
uranium likely will continue to be one of those bumps .			0

@entity217 : if elected , @entity2 and @entity27 will likely adopt different positions towards @entity3
sales of uranium , which @entity3 seeks , is a touchstone issue in the @entity13 - @entity3 relationship
@entity2 has stated that @entity3 is the emerging superpower @entity13 will never take " for granted "
@entity27 , a former diplomat to @entity111 , is seen as more reluctant to sell uranium to @entity3
