-- a former campaign staffer for @entity3 mayor @entity2 became the second woman to publicly accuse him of sexual harassment , saying tuesday that the then - congressman patted her " posterior " while at a fundraising event			1
@entity8 , who now runs a political consulting firm , told @entity10 that it happened in 2005 when she was working as @entity2 's deputy campaign manager			1
@entity8 said she did n't go public with the incident at the time because she was trying to build her political career			1
but she said she now feels emboldened to tell her story after @entity2 's former spokeswoman , @entity16 , sued him for sexual harassment monday			1
@entity19 said @entity2 subjected her and other women to " crude and disgusting " comments and inappropriate touching			2
she said she resigned as @entity2 's communications director in june after deciding the mayor would not change his behavior			1
" i had to work and do my job in an atmosphere where women were viewed by mayor @entity2 as sexual objects or stupid idiots , " @entity19 said			1
she said @entity2 asked her to work without underwear and made repeated sexual advances toward her			1
" he is not fit to be mayor of our great city			0
he is not fit to hold any public office			0
a man who lacks character makes a mockery of his ideas , " she said			0
@entity8 told @entity10 on tuesday that the incident happened as she was escorting @entity2 from table to table at a fundraising dinner			1
at one point , she said , someone at the event told @entity2 that @entity8 had " worked her ass off " for him			1
" he turned to me and he said , ' turn around , ' " @entity8 said tuesday			2
" and as a staffer , i know it sounds silly to just do it , but you just do it			0
and so i turned around and he proceeded to take his hand and pat me on my posterior and laugh and say , ' no , it 's still there			2
' " @entity8 gave the station a copy of an e-mail she sent to @entity2 in which she asked for an apology			1
a few days later , @entity10 reported , @entity2 mumbled " i 'm sorry " but told her she did n't understand what happened			1
@entity2 has been battling allegations of sexual harassment for several weeks , but none of the women leveling those claims came forward before @entity19 filed her suit in state court			1
her lawyer , @entity74 , called on @entity2 to resign , telling reporters , " apologies alone will not take care of this injustice			2
" in a statement issued monday evening , @entity2 said he was " saddened " by the accusations , but " i remain committed to the people of @entity3 and the work that needs to be done			2
" " once due process is allowed to unfold , i am certain there will be a better understanding of this situation , " he said , adding , " i humbly ask that through this vicious storm of controversy , people take a moment and temper their rush to judgment			0
" @entity2 said last week that he believes he will be vindicated by " a full presentation of the facts			0
" but he has also acknowledged , " i need help , " and added , " i 'm clearly doing something wrong			0
" " i am embarrassed to admit that i have failed to fully respect the women who work for me and with me , and that at times i have intimidated them , " @entity2 said in a statement earlier this month			0
" it 's a good thing that behavior that would have been tolerated in the past is being called out in this generation for what it is : inappropriate and wrong			0
" the 70 - year - old @entity2 served five terms in @entity108 before being elected mayor in 2012			2
he says he will not resign			0
@entity19 said she decided to resign after @entity2 's deputy chief of staff resigned in june			1
@entity2 " refused to listen to someone he had known for 35 years , and who told him explicitly , during a senior staff meeting , that his behavior with women was terrible and possibly illegal			0
@entity2 " laughed it off , " she said			0
