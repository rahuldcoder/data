@entity0 -- after seeing @entity5 gov. @entity4 's lackluster performance in debates and accompanying drop in the polls , some pundits conclude it would take a force of nature to save his campaign			1
fortunately for @entity4 , such a force does exist , and her name is @entity16			2
a dose of @entity16 power would do much to revitalize @entity4 's chances to win the @entity21 presidential nomination			1
of course , such a coveted endorsement comes with costs			0
rock stars such as @entity16 do n't just walk into campaign headquarters asking to lend a helping hand			0
@entity4 must be committed to a careful wooing process and to meeting most of her demands , however diva-esque they may be			0
so why should @entity4 grovel at @entity16 's feet in solicitation of unmitigated support ? because in the big picture , @entity16 power is just what the campaign doctor ordered			1
just envision the image of these two politicians hitting the trails in @entity40 and @entity41 , flanked by journalists and flashing cameras at every juncture			0
this dynamism and attention would infuse @entity4 's campaign with a @entity49 cachet that his opponents lack			2
or better yet , imagine a commercial with @entity16 touting @entity4 as a great @entity52 and a true , true @entity54 ( hint hint )			0
@entity16 's endorsement would give the @entity5 more street cred among tea party constituents , generate large crowds and fill his campaign coffers till overflowing			1
but more decisively , @entity16 's advocacy would do for @entity4 what @entity63 gov. @entity62 's endorsement of @entity64 does not , and that is excite a critical contingent of the @entity21 base : those pesky evangelicals who are just begging for an excuse to reject @entity64			1
@entity4 's @entity5 charm coupled with @entity16 's rock - star status would get everyone talking about the @entity5 as a viable candidate again			1
with front - runner @entity77 sidetracked by the recent revelation of sexual harassment allegations leveled at him while he ran the @entity81 in the 1990s , the timing for a @entity4 - @entity16 alliance could not be better			0
but while it is easy to see how @entity4 could benefit from an infusion of @entity16 power , what does the @entity83 maverick with a penchant for self - promotion have to gain by pitching her potency toward @entity4 ? with @entity16 's decision not to enter the race comes the threat of losing her voice			1
supporting @entity4 would provide @entity16 with a plausible context to remain in the limelight , which translates into more photo ops , more speeches , more television interviews and more chances to flex her muscles			0
so both politicians have something to gain from joining forces			0
from @entity4 's vantage point , the @entity5 can win the nomination with her support			2
from @entity16 's perspective , her legend soars for saving a campaign on life support and , should @entity4 lose , she can save face by passionately proclaiming that she fought for the candidate and the values in which she believes			1
the country would also benefit from this strategic alliance because @entity16 's polarizing presence would force both @entity4 and @entity64 to reveal more precisely their conservative proclivities and commitments			1
simply put , @entity16 power would push both candidates more to the right , producing a more informed voting public and a clearer contrast between president @entity130 and the eventual @entity21 nominee			0
as @entity4 and @entity16 proceed toward the precipice of an uncertain future , each holds the solution to the other 's most pressing problem : @entity16 provides @entity4 with resuscitation ; @entity4 gives @entity16 relevance			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity142 .			0

@entity16 's endorsement could save @entity4 's presidential campaign , @entity142 says
it could also give @entity16 *newfound* relevance since she 's not in the race herself , he says
@entity142 : @entity16 's endorsement would give the @entity5 more street cred among tea party constituents
@entity16 's presence would also force @entity4 and @entity64 further to the right , @entity142 says
