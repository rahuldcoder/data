@entity0 -- the current @entity2 has worked just as many days as its legislative predecessors			1
it just has a lot less to show for it			0
according to a @entity1 analysis of congressional records that looked at bills that became law and the number of days lawmakers worked , members of the @entity7 have spent more than 150 days and @entity14 just over 140 days in session so far , comparable to previous congresses at this point in the term			1
but of the thousands of measures introduced , only 132 passed both			1
about one - fifth of those measures were to approve official names for post offices			1
in the previous @entity2 , the @entity7 worked 286 days and the @entity14 worked 349 days			1
that @entity2 passed 383 bills , according to @entity2 records			1
each @entity2 spans a two - year cycle			1
the logjam means important pieces of legislation -- such the transportation funding bill and measures to address high student loan rates and , yes , even the budget -- have n't passed			1
it was n't always this way			0
leaders on both sides of the aisle point to the split nature of the current @entity2 -- with republicans controlling the @entity7 and @entity41 the @entity14 -- as the source of partisan showdowns that have further slowed legislative progress			1
however , the 107th @entity2 , which spanned 2001 and 2002 , was a period in which the @entity14 majority changed three times while @entity40 maintained control of the @entity7			2
it was also a time of political unity after the 9/11 attacks			2
during that @entity2 , lawmakers enacted the @entity53 , created the @entity54 and authorized the use of military force against @entity57 among other pieces of legislation			2
in all , that @entity2 passed 377 measures			1
the 111th @entity2 in 2009 " was exceedingly productive			1
it was a time of unified government , " said @entity61 , senior fellow at the @entity62 and co-author of " it 's even worse than it looks : how the @entity68 constitutional system collided with the @entity69			0
" " if you look at major legislation passed , it ranks with the most productive in modern history			2
" that year , the @entity73 - controlled @entity2 passed the health care reform law			1
the controversial measure 's passage ushered in a new era of tea party - backed @entity40 freshman and gave the @entity40 control of the 112th @entity7 in 2010			0
those freshmen vowed to repeal the health care reform act and crack down on government waste and abuse			0
but in helping slow what they see as a runaway freight train of federal bills , they 've also helped slow the pace of government , political experts say			1
@entity91 , @entity92 and the ' @entity93 ' @entity2 take for example , last year 's government shutdown battle over trimming the national debt			2
@entity98 freshmen , true to their word , pushed hard against any compromise , demanding debt reductions only be offset by spending cuts , not revenue increases			0
" the @entity40 majority in the @entity7 , it has been one of the least productive in modern history , not surprisingly , " @entity61 said			0
there are also fewer measures being sent over to the respective chambers for votes			0
for example , during the politically split 107th @entity2 , the @entity7 sent the @entity14 346 measures and the @entity14 sent the @entity7 199			1
in this @entity2 , the @entity7 has so far sent the @entity14 198 bills and the @entity14 has sent the @entity7 58			2
the legislative year is n't over			0
they still have nearly six months left , minus any vacation days , the august recess and home - visit days			0
@entity2 has passed a number of measures extending federal funding as well as free - trade agreements with @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125			1
but barring a mathematical miracle , it is unlikely this @entity2 will make up the legislative shortfall , especially during an election year when the focus is on campaigning and getting re-elected			2
both parties are quick to assign blame for the legislative slowdown			0
@entity7 minority leader @entity134 , @entity135 , recently called on house speaker @entity136 to nix additional recesses , although some saw it as more of a political move			0
" instead of recessing yet again , the @entity7 should remain at work and pass critical legislation that will create jobs for the middle class that will actually be signed into law			0
republicans must not run out the clock on the economy , " @entity134 wrote @entity136 in a letter			0
@entity1 reached out to @entity136 's office for comment , but the office referred questions to other representatives			2
other republicans have made similar complaints about @entity41			0
could @entity2 go from bad to worse after election ? last month , senate minority leader @entity158 said @entity41 are " irresponsible " for failing to pass a budget			2
" if you 're looking for a simple , three - word description of the @entity73 approach to the problems we face , it 's this : duck and cover , " @entity160 said on a day of heated budget debate			0
at this point , the foot - dragging and finger - pointing is all about embarrassing the other party , @entity61 said			1
" it is about generating blame for something , about trying to put the other side in a difficult political position			0

@entity1 analysis : current @entity2 least productive of past few sessions so far
of the thousands of measures introduced , only 132 have passed both houses
about one in five measures were to name post offices
despite a split @entity2 and partisan finger - pointing , political experts say both parties are at fault
