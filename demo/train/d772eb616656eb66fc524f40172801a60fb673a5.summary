-- gadget fans may be focused on the @entity3 trade show this week , but there 's something else notable going on today : it 's the @entity7 's fifth birthday			1
five years ago today , @entity8 unveiled the original @entity7 to the world			1
it was n't a tightly kept secret , shrouded in mystery and speculation like more recent @entity8 announcements , but it was arguably the world 's most anticipated gadget launch			1
although its form factor -- a capacitive touchscreen candy bar -- has n't dramatically changed over the years , each iteration of the @entity7 has yielded important improvements			2
let 's take a look back at how the @entity7 revolutionized what we thought a phone could be			1
the iphone is revealed " an @entity27 , a phone , an internet mobile communicator , " @entity26 said when preparing to introduce the @entity7 in january 2007			1
" an @entity27 , a phone , an internet mobile communicator ...			0
these are not three separate devices ! " the original @entity7 launched on @entity34 with a handful of @entity8 - created apps			1
it had a @entity37 — 480 resolution , 3.5 - inch capacitive touchscreen and 2 - megapixel camera , and ran @entity40 1.0			0
inside , it featured a @entity42 processor , a proximity sensor , and an accelerometer			0
priced at $ 499 and $ 599 for @entity46 and @entity47 models , the @entity7 did n't actually go on sale to eager hordes of consumers ( hundreds of whom waited outside @entity51 ) until june 29			2
" as a device , it 's a genre - bender , " former @entity53 editor @entity52 said in his review of the landmark device			2
" never before have @entity58 consumers had access to a phone that is simultaneously so powerful , so elegant , and that performs so many functions			0
" @entity63 , the @entity64 and @entity40 @entity8 's second generation iphone debuted in the summer of 2008			1
internally , it was largely identical to its predecessor : same processor , same type of display , same 2.0 megapixel camera , same amount of memory			0
but the @entity63 , as the name implied , now supported @entity77 operability , as well as @entity78			2
more importantly , though , the launch of the @entity63 was accompanied by @entity80 , which included an industry - altering addition : the @entity64			1
the @entity64 finally let independent , third - party developers legally create apps for the device with a 70/30 revenue split weighted toward @entity8			1
the @entity64 has been an incredible success story for @entity8 and developers alike			2
it houses more than half - a - million apps , and there 's been more than 18 billion downloads to date			1
pretty much every mobile platform has its own app market now , and most are modeled similarly to @entity8 's			1
@entity93 the @entity93 was primarily an incremental improvement over the @entity63 , but it included some notable hardware improvements that would continue through later iterations of the phone			1
first , the @entity93 included a camera upgrade : a 3 - megapixel , autofocusing camera that shot decent video that could be edited and easily sent to @entity100 or other destinations			2
photography would become an increasingly important feature for @entity7 users			0
the processor was upgraded to a @entity107 chip , and the display was upped to @entity109 — 320 pixels			0
the @entity93 also added a compass , a tool that would prove incredibly useful in apps like @entity114			2
on the software side , the @entity115 also added @entity117 , and @entity118 , now at version 3.0 , finally added a cut / copy / paste functionality to the system			0
iphone 4 : @entity124 , ' @entity123 ' and @entity125 the @entity7 stunned the world with its radically redesigned look , which @entity128 revealed early after getting its hands on a prototype			2
a 3.5 - inch @entity131 put pretty much every other smartphone display to shame : at @entity135 — 640 and bearing a 326ppi pixel density , it offered pixels smaller than the human eye could detect			0
the @entity7 was also encased front and back by slim slabs of glass , and ringed by an aluminum rim			0
the visual conceit was slick , and @entity8 received kudos for its smart industrial design refresh			0
unfortunately , that aluminum rim became the source of a debacle known as " @entity123 " : because of the external antenna design of the phone , if users held it a particular way , they would experience a drop in signal strength			0
the @entity7 debuted in june 2010 , still on @entity34 like its predecessors , but in january 2011 , @entity8 expanded availability to @entity125			1
@entity158 delivers @entity159 expecting an entirely differently designed @entity7 5 , some @entity8 fans were disappointed by the announcement of merely an " @entity158			1
" however , pre-sale numbers and opening weekend sales numbers proved the @entity158 to be the most successful @entity7 launch in @entity8 's history			1
a major reason for the success of the @entity158 was its new voice - controlled virtual assistant , @entity159			0
hackers attempting to port @entity159 to other @entity118 devices have almost succeeded , but the solution just is n't available for the masses			0
others though , are more interested in hacking @entity159 to control other gadgets in their lives like thermostats or a rotary dial phone			0
