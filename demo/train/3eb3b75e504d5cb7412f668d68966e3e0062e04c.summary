@entity0 -- in a scathing ruling , a federal judge has denied a request by @entity6 's son - in - law to have alleged 9/11 mastermind @entity7 testify in his defense at trial , either by teleconference from the @entity11 or via deposition			1
in a motion to the court over the weekend , @entity14 's defense team said @entity7 can provide evidence that their client had no knowledge of planned terror attacks and asked that portions of an unsworn , written statement by @entity7 be allowed before the jury even if his testimony was not			1
@entity7 , the admitted mastermind of the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks , issued a rambling defense of @entity29 , who is on trial in @entity0			1
@entity29 is accused of being @entity32 's propagandist in the wake of the 9/11 attacks			1
the rare statement by @entity7 was in response to questions from @entity29 's attorney and was filed in @entity39 in @entity40 on sunday night			2
at a hearing on the matter tuesday morning , @entity42 district judge @entity41 called the defense motion " entirely baseless " and said nothing @entity7 may testify to is relevant to @entity14 's case			1
" there is n't a shred of evidence that @entity7 ever met @entity14 at all , " @entity48 said			1
@entity14 was captured last year after years of being among a group of alleged @entity32 operatives sheltered in @entity54			1
he was arrested in @entity55 and deported to @entity56 via @entity57 , which helped @entity42 agents capture him			0
in his statement , @entity7 said @entity29 was a " pious man " and among many scholars drawn to @entity65 when the @entity61 took control of the country in the mid- 1990s			2
he said he does n't recall meeting @entity14 and that , as a scholar and preacher , @entity14 would n't have known about military operations , in part because @entity32 was careful to restrict access to such information			1
" he did not play any military role , and to the best of my knowledge , he did not receive any military training at any of the training camps for the mujahedeen in @entity65 , " @entity7 said			0
prosecutors had objected to @entity7 's testimony , saying the issue is causing unnecessary delays and is inconsequential because @entity7 has said he will not agree to testify			2
" this is a motion for what ? they have no witness , judge , " said assistant u.s. attorney @entity84 at the hearing			0
@entity14 's defense attorney @entity88 said the defense team has worked as quickly as possible since last summer to secure @entity7 's testimony , but stalling and administrative roadblocks by the @entity91 made their efforts futile			1
" at the end of the day , the @entity91 was never going to let @entity7 appear in a courtroom , " said @entity88 in court			0
a clearly aggravated @entity48 dismissed @entity88 's claim and instead said the defense team " sat on their hands " as the case headed for trial			0
@entity48 also noted that the attorneys were offered the opportunity last month to conduct an in - person interview with @entity7 at @entity11 , but for some reason changed their minds and submitted written questions only			2
when @entity88 rose to respond , he was told to sit back down			0
@entity88 and co-counsel @entity107 told @entity1 after the hearing that they abandoned the plan to interview @entity7 when they were told representatives for the @entity91 and the @entity111 would be present			0
also tuesday , @entity48 told @entity112 she may face sanctions for improperly bringing another motion alleging the prosecution has not turned over exhibits to the defense as required			0
as the attorney began to respond , @entity48 adjourned the session and left the bench			0
the jury returns wednesday morning for testimony by an audio expert for the defense about the authenticity of an audio recording allegedly featuring the defendant and a character witness who is traveling from @entity56 to testify .			0
