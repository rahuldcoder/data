on our final 2014 trip around the " @entity4 " table , our reporters shared insights on a key midterm year moment -- or a key marker to look for in 2015			2
some of the nuggets were a bit of both : 1			2
@entity11 who ? @entity14 's important outreach to her left we end the year with several liberal groups urging sen. @entity18 of @entity19 to change her mind and seek the presidency in 2016			1
some of this is real , some is part fund - raising gimmick , and some is designed to keep pressure on runaway @entity29 front - runner @entity28			2
@entity31 's @entity30 shared reporting of how @entity14 is paying close attention -- and making key inroads			1
one group that has not joined the " @entity37 " movement just happens to be the one perhaps closest to her , the @entity39			1
@entity30 took us inside a key meeting -- a top @entity14 political aide sitting down with @entity39 leadership			1
" this is the first time you 're seeing people in @entity47 trying to build a bridge openly , in a serious way , toward @entity37 's supporters			1
this is also the group that has not joined the draft movement			2
so i think that this is something you are going to see more of going forward			2
a @entity58 turning point @entity59 of the @entity60 highlighted the bruising @entity62 primary as a 2014 turning point			2
remember , tea party favorite @entity64 nearly beat incumbent @entity68 sen. @entity67			2
" if @entity64 had won that primary , it would have cost @entity68 candidates across the country a lot of political points , " @entity59 noted			0
" they would have to answer for all of his statements , all of his radio comments from the past			0
" instead , though , the @entity68 establishment carried the day			0
" that primary really signaled what was happening in the party this year -- a push back against the tea party ahead of 2016 , trying to get the party toward the center , back toward a winning coalition			2
" the tea party promises a comeback in 2015 and beyond			0
a wartime presidential legacy ? @entity91 of @entity92 recalled some big presidential decisions of 2014 that proved how difficult it is for president @entity96 to follow the foreign policy course he laid out in his initial 2008 campaign			1
" one of the defining moments in 2014 for the @entity101 was president @entity96 's decision to launch airstrikes in @entity104 and @entity105			1
i 've covered @entity96 for a very long time			1
and if you had told me that i would be writing about him going back into military conflict in the @entity110 instead of pulling out of it , i would have told you you were crazy , " @entity91 said			0
looking back , @entity91 recalled " getting out of the @entity110 , war in the @entity110 , was a central promise , a central promise that @entity96 made to the voters			1
and if he ends his presidency in military conflict , then i think it really jeopardizes the legacy for him			0
@entity96 betting on his ' emerging ' coalition in several big 2014 challenges , @entity122 of the @entity60 saw @entity96 being guided by his loyalty to the new demographics of his core political constituency			1
and , she suggests , trying to send a signal to future @entity29 candidates			0
" immigration reform , @entity96 's moves on @entity134 , as well as some of his comments on @entity137 and race , " were three topics @entity130 believes can be linked , in part			1
" part of his , you know , sort of ' @entity143 ' moment is realizing and really embracing the idea that the @entity29 is -- is a black and brown party , is a party that is going to be progressive -- progressive around these issues of race			0
you know , part of sort of the downside of that , we saw some of that in 2014 with the cratering of the white vote			0
" ( the 1998 comedy " @entity143 " is about a politician who starts saying exactly what he thinks			0
) but looking forward , @entity130 notes , @entity28 seems to agree with @entity96			1
" with @entity14 very much doubling down on that , some of the comments she 's made on race , her immediately coming out in terms of the immigration reform -- this is going to have consequences , i think , for the party , the @entity29 , going forward			1
" and , she suggests , @entity68 ignore the lessons at their peril			0
@entity171 and @entity174 's @entity173 's resolution old school is the way to go -- if you 're speaker @entity171 and majority leader - to - be @entity177			1
both are mindful that deadline budget deals have created political openings for what they consider harmful tea party antics in recent years -- most noteworthy , of course , the government shutdown			0
so their plan is to go back to old - fashioned budgeting : passing individual appropriations bills for government agencies and having those debates in the spring and summer -- well in advance of the october 1 beginning of the fiscal year			0
that way if , say , sen. @entity196 of @entity197 wants to derail the process because of some @entity185 objection , the delay happens harmlessly in the summer or early fall -- not up against the deadline			0
same goes if it 's the democrats who are trying to make a point			1
or even if there is a presidential veto of an appropriations bill			0
less drama and political harm , @entity171 and @entity174 believe , if these things are dealt with in what @entity213 calls regular order			1
so if it is regular -- normal -- why is it such a big test ? well , the last time @entity218 and the @entity101 went through a full appropriations process in regular order ? @entity220 was president .			0

@entity14 's team reaches out to @entity37 supporters
@entity171 and @entity174 make a @entity173 's resolution
@entity96 bets on his " emerging " coalition
