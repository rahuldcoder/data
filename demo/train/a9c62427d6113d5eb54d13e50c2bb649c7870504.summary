as expected , the radical left party @entity1 was the big winner of the @entity5 elections , coming only two seats short of an absolute majority in parliament			1
but it 's unclear if new prime minister @entity10 will be able to effectively pursue his anti-austerity agenda and renegotiate the terms of the @entity5 bailout with creditors -- and he will surely need to make a number of concessions to its coalition partners , the @entity17 , a right - wing anti-immigration party			1
what does this victory mean for @entity5 and for the debt - ridden countries of southern @entity23 ? for @entity5 , this is a decisive step in the demise of @entity26 and @entity27 , the parties that have been in power for 40 years			1
secondly , it shows the failure of the political strategy pursued by the @entity33 ( the @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 ) to implement austerity in southern @entity23 by relying on centrist parties to form a cartel that is insulated from voters			1
austerity is of course the main culprit for the death of traditional politics in @entity5			2
this is mainly because it has undermined the system of mass party patronage on which the two traditional big parties on the center - left ( @entity26 ) and center - right ( @entity27 ) have relied on to alternate in power			0
read more : what 's next for @entity5 ? for four decades , politicians from both parties built their electoral success on the distribution of political spoils in exchange for votes : public sector jobs ( for their affiliated trade unions ) , infrastructure projects , protection from competitors through licensing and closed shops ( for taxi drivers ; truck drivers ) , and social benefits targeted at particular occupations , among other perks and benefits benefiting party supporters			1
" pork barrel politics , " as it is known , has long been the cornerstone of @entity5 politics -- and also one of the causes of the deep economic problems it is facing now			2
this immensely costly system was able to survive at the cost of high inflation and currency devaluations ( before the euro ) or mounting public debt ( since @entity5 's entry into the euro )			1
but when the interest rates on government bonds shot up and debt could no longer be used to finance the spoils system , @entity5 was taken to the brink of bankruptcy			2
when the @entity33 imposed a drastic program of austerity and liberalization , @entity26 and @entity27 were deprived of the very tools they had relied on for so long to stay in power			0
turning off the tap of public spending was like slitting their own wrists : voters and their traditional clienteles abandoned them because they had no real ideological program other than running the state			0
this problem was particularly brutal for @entity26 , which collapsed from nearly 40 % support before the crisis to 4 % today			0
this opened up room for new challengers on the left ( @entity1 ) promising a rupture with the old elites , but also on the far right ( @entity124 )			2
the victory of @entity1 also signals the broader failure of the political strategy that has been employed to implement austerity in the debt - ridden countries of southern @entity23 -- a strategy best described as " cartel politics "			1
cartel politics involves the formation of political alliances between the ruling centrist parties to implement austerity			0
just as competing firms sometimes agree to fix prices or production levels , competing political parties agree to put their ideological differences aside to cling to power together in spite of the huge unpopularity of the policies they put in place			2
this is essentially what happened in @entity5 with the @entity151 government , but also in @entity152 with the technocratic cabinet of @entity154 or the grand coalition of @entity156 , which united the center - left @entity158 and @entity161 's right - wing @entity160			1
in @entity164 , another country in dire economic conditions , the socialist minority government of @entity163 also benefited from the informal support of its main center - right counterpart to carry out austerity measures and avoid a bailout ( which failed )			0
in @entity173 , the nascent rise of the left - wing @entity171 can also be explained by the lack of differentiation of center - left and center - right policies before and after the crisis , even if it never materialized in a de facto coalition			0
forming political cartels is understandable in a context where any party in office is bound to have to pass unpopular policies ( spending cuts , tax hikes ) imposed by creditors that will cost votes and alienate a sizable share of the electorate			1
it is a good way to stay in office in the short term , but it is a terrible way to keep votes in the medium and long term , because no choice is presented to citizens			0
whoever they vote for , the policies will be the same , and they will be painful			0
abstention and apathy grows and voters become attracted to challengers promising an alternative			0
as the electoral base of centrist parties shrinks , the only way for them to remain in power is to band together to compensate for the loss of voters , until this electoral base becomes too small to stay in government			0
@entity1 is the first challenger to break the @entity5 political cartel			1
@entity5 may be a special case because of the extent of its economic collapse , but other movements elsewhere are also looming on the horizon			2
in @entity173 , @entity220 has been leading the polls in spite of the fact that it was created less than a year ago			0
in @entity152 , @entity226 's @entity225 movement has made a breakthrough in the last @entity23 elections			1
others will surge if politicians continue to believe that democracy can be put on hold to satisfy markets .			1

anti-austerity party @entity1 claims victory in @entity5 elections
@entity238 : @entity1 is the first party to break one of southern @entity23 's political cartels
@entity238 : others countries may follow suit if politicians put democracy on hold to satisfy markets
