@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 is investigating threats against the parents of @entity7 sgt. @entity6 , the latest development in a case that has put the spotlight on the circumstances surrounding his capture in @entity14 and release by the @entity16			1
" we are working jointly with our state and local partners and taking each threat seriously , " @entity3 special agent @entity17 told @entity2 in an e-mail on saturday			1
@entity17 declined to detail the nature and severity of the threats , and a military spokesperson for the @entity26 declined to comment			0
@entity6 's parents have not been seen publicly since the announcement last week that the soldier had been freed from five years in captivity at the hands of the @entity16 in exchange for the release of five detainees at @entity35			1
@entity6 's release raises questions the news comes as a fallen soldier 's mother and a former member of @entity6 's unit continued to assert that troops were killed while searching for the soldier in eastern @entity14			1
@entity50 and @entity7 officials have looked at such claims , and " right now there is no evidence to back that up , " a @entity46 official , speaking on condition of anonymity , has told @entity2			0
but former sgt. @entity55 , a member of @entity6 's platoon , told @entity2 's @entity57 that " men were injured and killed in the search for him			1
" " the mission was to find @entity6 , " @entity55 said			0
in the week since @entity6 was released by the @entity16 , a controversy has grown over whether troops were killed , directly or indirectly , in the search			1
former soldiers involved in the operations asserted to @entity2 this week that at least six soldiers were killed in the search for @entity6			2
the six soldiers at the center of the @entity6 debate how did 6 die after @entity6 's disappearance ? also making claims of troop deaths in the @entity6 search is @entity75 , the mother of 2nd lt. @entity76 , who was killed in september 2009			1
she endorsed accusations by former unit members that @entity6 deserted and caused @entity46 troops to die in the search for him -- though defense secretary @entity81 has said it 's " unfair " to @entity6 and his family to presume anything about his disappearance			1
@entity76 said she believes her son and other troops " were strictly on a mission looking for @entity6			2
" that information is " based on the men that served with @entity76 , " she told @entity57			0
@entity76 said that military should give her family information " on what @entity76 was doing and why they lied to us			0
" " i 'd like to see @entity6 given an opportunity to tell his story , be on trial , have the witnesses come forward and tell their story and get the truth through that , and then i would like to see the full measure of the law followed for his punishment , " @entity76 said			2
watch : @entity107 defends @entity6 swap @entity6 went missing on june 30 , 2009 , in @entity14 's @entity110 province , where he was deployed with the @entity111 , @entity112 , 4th @entity113 , @entity114			0
an @entity7 fact - finding investigation conducted in the months after his disappearance concluded that @entity6 left his outpost deliberately and of his own free will , according to the official , who was briefed on the report			0
the @entity7 has no definitive finding that @entity6 deserted because that would require knowing his intent -- something @entity7 officials could n't learn without talking to the soldier , a @entity46 military official told @entity2			0
see @entity128 's special on @entity6 's time in captivity , life before the @entity7 and what happened the night he disappeared the @entity6 files : a custom magazine @entity134 and @entity135 reported from @entity0 , @entity1 , and @entity136 reported and wrote from @entity137 ; @entity2 's @entity138 and @entity139 contributed to this report .			2
