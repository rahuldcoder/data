-- security screeners at @entity2 singled out @entity4 and @entity5 passengers for nearly two years , according to a federal report obtained by @entity9 - @entity8 newspaper			1

a @entity12 spokeswoman described the situation in @entity2 as " isolated " and said the agency took action to fix it			2
" while the actions referenced in the report were based on intelligence reports regarding false documentation , criminal or illegal activity and the possible impact on transportation security , @entity12 's policies were overstepped , " spokeswoman @entity22 said			1
according to the @entity8 , the report said @entity12 agents stationed at the @entity2 airport would stop @entity4 and @entity5 , asking them additional questions , reviewing their passports and visas and searching their luggage			1
the report did not specify how many agents were involved , but " leaves no doubt that the process was widespread , " the newspaper said			0
" the report said @entity4 and @entity5 passengers were singled out for scrutiny of their travel documents as an easy way to drive up the number of referrals by @entity2 's ( behavior detection officer ) unit so that it would appear productive , " the newspaper said			1
@entity22 said the @entity12 does not permit racial profiling , and a manager accused of promoting profiling in the report is no longer in management with the agency			1
" eighteen months ago , @entity12 took immediate remedial action and retrained the entire behavior detection workforce at @entity2 , " she said			1
four managers in the report were cited to be disciplined by the @entity12 , the @entity8 said			2
one manager who was demoted after the investigation told the @entity8 that he denied the accusation and had appealed the demotion decision			0

a story published by the @entity8 sunday said the newspaper had obtained the report , but did not disclose how			0
@entity69 , legal director of the @entity70 in @entity71 , called the report " alarming and astounding			1
" " the possibility that @entity12 supervisors coached screeners to profile passengers based on race is deeply disturbing			0
... we hope the @entity12 takes the proper steps immediately to ensure there is no racial profiling in our airports or that screeners are even given the perception that they should profile passengers based on race , " he said in a statement			0
there are about 3,000 behavior detection officers at 161 airports in the @entity90 , and plans to expand the program are in the works			1
in april @entity0 obtained a list of 70 indicators the officers use to identify people who might pose a threat to aviation			0
none of those indicators referred to or suggested race , ethnicity or religion			0
at the time , the @entity12 told @entity0 no single behavior on the list would , by itself , ever be enough to draw increased security scrutiny			0
