every single week for the past 22 years , a group of elderly @entity2 women has camped outside the @entity4 @entity3 in @entity5 , enduring the heat and humidity of the region 's monsoonal summer and the sub-zero temperatures of the brutal @entity2 winter			1
why ? they want an apology for being forced into sexual slavery as so - called " comfort women " by the @entity4 military before and during @entity17 -- an apology that numerous @entity4 governments insist has already been publicly given more than two decades ago			1
it has been almost 70 years since the end of @entity17 and yet this issue still has the power to derail relations at the very top of these two countries			0
the issue of " comfort women " is expected to be discussed when officials from @entity29 and @entity5 meet wednesday in an effort to improve frosty relations ahead of president @entity33 's tour of the region next week			1
@entity4 's prime minister @entity35 and @entity2 president @entity36 only met for the first time since both taking power last month			1
and only then because it was organized and led by @entity41 president @entity33 , eager to heal the rifts of his country 's two closest allies in the region			0
the two governments " have decided to engage in intensive discussions on various subjects at various levels " to improve conditions surrounding relations , the @entity4 foreign ministry said in a statement			2
the issue of comfort women is an emotive one that ignites passions in both countries			1
many of these women have already passed away			0
only 55 of those registered with the @entity2 government are still alive			1
a small , but vocal voice within the @entity4 opposition has been calling for a revision of the @entity67 statement made in 1993 -- a statement made by then chief cabinet secretary @entity67 that accepted @entity4 's responsibility for recruiting " comfort women " and extended " its sincere apologies and remorse			1
" it is this statement @entity75 of the @entity76 wants changed			0
" we are not saying the @entity67 statement should be nullified because we dislike it or it is irritating to the @entity4 people , " he said			0
" @entity4 had state - run prostitution just like other countries in the world around @entity17 and we admit that there were unfortunately women working there			2
" forgotten faces : @entity4 's comfort women ' deeply pained ' @entity35 diluted this argument recently when he insisted @entity4 would not retract its apology			1
" i am deeply pained to think of the comfort women who experienced immeasurable pain and suffering , a feeling i share equally with my predecessors , " he said			2
but the suggestion that up to 200,000 women , mainly @entity2 , used by the @entity4 military , were official prostitutes infuriates the former sex slaves			1
they insist they were forcibly taken from @entity99 or tricked into leaving , thinking they were being transferred to other jobs			0
@entity102 , 89 , says she was transported to half a dozen countries over eight years by the @entity4 military from the age of 14			2
" every sunday , soldiers came to the brothel from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m. on saturday , from noon until five , plus weekdays , " she said			0
" i could not stand at the end of the weekend			0
" saying the @entity4 military destroyed her life , she is furious at the minority in @entity4 calling the accounts of " comfort women " into question			1
" i think they are mad , " she said at the weekly protest			0
" you can not lie with a sane mind			0
maybe they are senile to be saying such absurd things			0
" ' comfort women necessary ' comment raises concerns @entity99 relations the issue remains heavily divisive between the two nations			1
" the issue of sex slaves is no longer in the hands of the @entity2 government , " said @entity126 , a professor at @entity127 in @entity5			1
" as long as 55 former sex slaves are alive ... the issue lies in the hands of the @entity2 public			2
they want the @entity4 government to acknowledge , apologize , compensate and educate their children that their government has committed the crimes of forcing young @entity2 girls to sex slavery			1
" no @entity2 government can ignore or deviate from such national consensus without risking losing public support			1
" @entity126 said @entity4 also disagrees with @entity2 's efforts to make this an international issue , believing it should be dealt with bi-laterally			2
wednesday 's meeting between the two countries is certainly a start , but as the first such meeting , one that is expected to reap little in the short term			0
@entity153 , a professor at @entity154 in central @entity4 , insisted more time and a generational change is needed before a resolution can be hoped for			0
" this is not that old an issue , " he said			0
" this issue only really came up in the 1990s and @entity4 and @entity2 are looking at the issue from totally different perspectives			2
they can never agree while there is such a large gap in perception			0
it may not be resolved for 20 years			0
" @entity4 ex-prime minister meets comfort women another voice lost , @entity2 ' comfort woman ' dies			1
