@entity0 made what was for some a shocking suggestion at one of the most traditionally conservative meetings leading up to the @entity5			2
the 31 - year - old delegate from @entity7 formally suggested that her party 's ideological manifesto recognize civil unions for same - sex couples as well as straight ones			1
" as a @entity16 , there 's nobody in this room who believes ( more than i do ) that the definition of marriage is between one man and one woman , but those are my religious beliefs , " @entity13 said as she made the motion monday			1
" this country was founded on the separation of church and state			2
" she added , " for my own generation , a lot of times homosexuality is not the biggest deal in the world			2
" many other controversial amendments were met with " crickets , " as one @entity5 staffer said			2
meaning , on those topics , there was n't even a move to vote on the matter			2
can ' true @entity16 ' support same - sex marriage ? @entity13 's initiative , much to her own surprise , was met with a resounding shout of " second " from not one , but from a couple of people in the room			1
@entity50 , a state representative from @entity51 , was one of the delegates who affirmed @entity13 's motion			1
" i 'm from @entity54 , where support for gay couples is really old news , " @entity50 said			1
in 2005 , her state became the first to create a law that allowed civil unions for same - sex couples without judicial interference			1
she voted in favor of the law on several occasions until it got through			0
" this speaks to the heart of what @entity70 believe in -- less government interference in our lives , " klarides said			1
" we want our party to focus on growth and the economy and allowing us to thrive as a people , not on telling people what they should do in our private lives			1
" klarides ' fellow republicans on the platform committee did not agree			0
she describes what it felt like to listen to the ensuing debate			0
" i called my mom afterward and said this woman put this amendment out there , and i seconded it , and you would have thought i took off all my clothes and stood in the middle of the aisle , " klarides said			0
@entity13 also called her mom after the meeting			0
her mother had read about her daughter 's amendment suggestion online			0
" my mom said , ' you are creating mischief again			0
i 'm so proud of you , ' " @entity13 said			0
others on the platform committee did n't share that sentiment			0
in his argument against the amendment , @entity111 delegate @entity110 characterized civil unions as " counterfeit marriage			1
" @entity110 , an adviser to @entity5 presidential candidate @entity116 , pointed to the popularity of constitutional amendments that ban same - sex marriage and argued that the party benefits politically from its opposition to it			1
" this suggests that strongly supporting traditional marriage is actually quite popular and would enhance the support of our candidates , " @entity110 said			0
@entity128 , president of the conservative @entity129 , made a strong argument against @entity13 's motion , calling " traditional marriage " a cornerstone of a healthy society			1
" this would move the party away immensely ( from ) the position this party has held , " @entity128 said			1
@entity5 mayor 's pro-same - sex marriage ad to air during convention the platform committee went on to include several other anti-gay issues in its proposed draft			1
an editorial in the @entity148 called it " more aggressive in its opposition to women 's reproductive rights and to gay rights than any in memory			1
" the draft affirmed the support of state constitutional amendment efforts under way to restrict same - sex marriage			1
it criticized the @entity163 administration 's " open defiance " of existing laws that should put a limit on gay people 's rights and " its handling of immigration cases , in federal personnel benefits , in allowing a same - sex marriage at a military base , and in refusing to defend @entity173 ( @entity173 ) in the courts			1
" and it reiterated the party 's support for an amendment to the @entity179 that would ban same - sex marriage			1
" it 's funny -- sitting in that room , i felt like people thought what i was proposing meant i was campaigning for president @entity163 , " @entity13 said			1
" back home where everyone is so much more liberal , people think i 'm so right wing			1
" @entity13 said after the meeting she had only one disturbing run - in			2
" one person did come up and tell me i should renounce my @entity195 -- that what i was spewing was pure evil , " @entity13 said			0
" it was hard to keep a straight face			0
" but for the most part , the reaction she received from other delegates and @entity5 staffers was positive			0
she said she felt that behind the scenes , the party was much more supportive			1
" people kept buying me drinks and kept coming up to me saying how they wanted to support my group for doing this			2
i do n't have a group , " @entity13 said			0
" some people asked me if i was gay			1
i told them you could still be for gay rights and be a heterosexual			2
i do n't think that 's political suicide			0
if it was , i would n't be a part of this party			2
" she said , " one guy even dropped a note in my lap. i thought i was going to get bashed with some nasty note , like you 'd get in fifth grade			0
but what it said essentially was , ' i 'm in the closet			0
thank you so much for this			0
' " people may now realize you can be gay and still be welcome in the @entity70 party			1
" while the @entity70 may take anti-gay positions on paper , behind the scenes many who advocate for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender causes feel more accepted			1
there is even an ad that will run during the convention that will feature @entity247 's @entity5 mayor , @entity246 , speaking out in favor of allowing same - sex marriage			1
@entity246 urges his party to do the same			2
the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender groups within the convention at @entity255 say they are still optimistic about their future			1
" the platform is a piece of paper , " said @entity259 , executive director of @entity260 , which will attend the convention and hold " @entity262 2012 , " a giant dance party with @entity5 notables after the speeches tuesday			1
@entity260 is the first gay @entity5 group to endorse @entity116 for president			2
" the platform does n't carry rights and responsibilities that the candidate is bound by , " he said			0
" routinely after the platform is out , candidates quickly make statements that they do n't agree with it			0
" @entity279 is not discouraged -- in fact he said he 's excited about how much they can do to support the ticket			0
" this election is bigger than one issue			0
we are in a crisis in this country and gay people need jobs			1
sure same - sex marriage is important , but we ca n't base our presidential vote on it , " @entity259 said			1
@entity294 , who runs the @entity295 , a national @entity5 gay and lesbian grassroots organization , said he 's optimistic about the party 's future as well despite the platform			1
" it 's disappointing , sure , " @entity294 said			0
" but all the polling data shows that the party is growing and strengthening because of this younger generation of @entity5 who believes in the true definition of conservatism , which is individual liberty and not having the government involved in your personal life			2
" @entity294 said leading up to the platform committee meeting , his group was invited for the first time to be directly involved in drafting the platform			0
@entity295 has n't endorsed @entity116 yet , but members will decide that issue soon			1
in the meantime , @entity294 points to small aspects of the platform that he thinks will benefit the lgbt community			0
" the original draft said one could not receive refugee status for nonpolitical reasons , which would mean that there are @entity319 people running for their lives who are n't political dissidents but who could n't come here , " he said			2
" they struck that from the language			0
" he also said in the marriage section , the platform committee added a caveat that " everyone deserves dignity and respect			0
" and he celebrates even the small victories			0
his group 's educational material was on a table " next to the stacks of @entity129 material , " @entity294 said			0
" i 'm sure they were reeling , but if they asked leadership why it was there , they would hear it is because the @entity5 asked that all materials be put out there for delegates and press to pick up			0
" it is a small thing , " he said , " but our presence was known here			0
we were invited to be much more engaged in the process than we ever have been before			0
" the @entity295 have several events planned for the convention , including brunches with other gay conservatives , and candidate meet - and - greets			1
the @entity363 is also hosting a party to celebrate its congressional allies			2
" i always wear my @entity295 pin , and people are always welcoming to us when we are here , " @entity294 said			1
" it 's extremely evident that there is an even bigger thing happening with the party			2
all the polling data shows that there is a generational shift that makes our party more accepting , even if it did not manifest itself in the platform			2
