-- every non-democratic government faces the following problem : when they tell the truth , everyone thinks it is a lie			0
recently , the new leadership of the @entity8 government has launched one of the most intense anti-corruption campaigns in decades to , as president @entity11 put it , fight both " flies " and " tigers			1
" @entity15 , a former @entity16 member and the biggest " tiger " so far that has fallen from grace , was sentenced to life in prison on sunday			2
yet very few outside observers believe that this marks a success in the anti-corruption campaign ; many argue that this is a political purge against a potential rival to the new regime			1
it is difficult to know how many ordinary @entity8 citizens feel the same way , but as the old @entity8 saying goes , " every new sovereign brings his own courtiers			2
" that is to say , people understand how politics works			0
the suspicion among the masses of the true intention of the government poses a major challenge to @entity8 's recent efforts to curb corruption			1
if the anti-graft drive was designed to create a better image of the @entity47 and make the @entity8 people happy , what if the people do n't believe it is sincere ? considering the huge costs of the campaign , is it really worthwhile if people consider this as just another round of political reshuffling to consolidate the new leaders ' power ? read more : @entity8 's @entity15 appeals conviction the costs are substantial : just imagine how much human and financial resources it took to investigate , arrest , adjudicate and imprison a high - ranking official , let alone the time it cost for the leadership to reach a consensus			1
the 18th @entity71 , a key meeting that began the once - in - a - decade leadership change , was delayed for about a month in late 2012 in the wake of the @entity15 scandal			1
however , the biggest cost comes from the fact that an intense campaign like this harms solidarity among the nation 's elite -- the key to the survival of single - party regimes			1
this presents the greatest dilemma of anti-corruption campaigns in any non-democratic regime			2
should they fight against corruption sincerely to avoid being overthrown by the masses but risk being assassinated by a desperate comrade in a coup from the inside ? should they launch a seemingly strong campaign to selectively crack down on some politicians to maintain elite unity but irritate the public ? the @entity8 government seems to have chosen the second strategy because , first , they care more about elite solidarity and , second , people are cynical any way			1
historical evidence is supportive of this			0
anti-corruption campaigns have arrived in waves : the late 1980s , early 1990s , early 2000s and today			0
big " tigers " have been arrested in each wave : @entity112 ( former @entity114 chief ) in 1995 , who was sentenced to 16 years in prison but released in 2006 due to health concerns			0
@entity117 , the former @entity118 chief , was suspended from the party in 2006 and eventually sentenced to 18 years in prison on bribery and corruption charges			0
and now @entity15 , the former @entity119 chief -- it is no coincidence that these waves occurred around leadership changes			1
bad policies are good politics			0
the @entity47 has had very few instances of elite split in the last 90 years since it was founded in 1921 because they figured that elite cohesion is far more important than public support in sustaining their rule			2
however , this strategy will not solve the dilemma forever			0
an empowered and enlightened public has increasingly threatened non-democratic regimes , as the @entity140 revealed			0
to have a long - term plan , the @entity47 needs to institute strong institutions such as @entity143 in @entity144 or an independent judiciary to check the power of the party and the government			1
it might be a pain in the short - run , but it will bring longevity to the party .			0

@entity153 : the recent corruption *crackdown* creates problems for @entity8 's political elite
the conviction of @entity15 follows a familiar pattern during @entity8 leadership changes
few observers believe @entity15 conviction marks a success in the anti-corruption campaign
the @entity47 needs to institute strong independent institutions to check corruption
