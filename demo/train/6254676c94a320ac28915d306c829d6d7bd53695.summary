@entity0 -- a man hurrying to catch the light at a corner in muggy downtown @entity0 carries a book with a rainbow of color on its cover			0
its title stands out , especially here , where the @entity12 has officially accepted a platform that a @entity15 editorial called " more aggressive in its opposition to women 's reproductive rights and to gay rights than any in memory			1
" the book is " a @entity21 : why @entity23 , conservatives , and @entity22			1
" @entity25 is a precinct committee person for the @entity23 in @entity26 , @entity27 , and the father of a gay son			1
he picked up the book at a brunch co-hosted by the @entity32 for the @entity33 to marry and the @entity34 -- two of a small number of visible @entity38 - supportive @entity12 groups at this year 's convention			1
individual members of the @entity34 have attended previous conventions , but this year marks a first for the group : it was invited by the @entity12 committee to participate in the convention itself			1
in addition , there are many high - profile , gay - themed events this year , including the brunch @entity25 attended			2
" i 've never been to an event of theirs , but people clearly went out of their way to be nice to me , " @entity25 said , with a catch in his voice			0
" it means so much since i 'm kind of new at this			0
" in fact , @entity59 , a @entity34 board member and one of the speakers at the brunch , began her speech by talking about @entity25			1
she said she teared up when she met @entity25 there and he told her how proud he and his wife are of their son , @entity67			0
@entity69 is getting married to @entity70 , who was also there working on behalf of @entity72 , a political action committee that supports @entity12 candidates who are gay friendly			0
@entity70 is so involved in @entity12 politics that they 've scheduled their ceremony in @entity77 after the november election			0
" that 's what this is all about -- events where we can talk to @entity23 about why marriage matters for our community , conservative to conservative , " @entity59 said			1
@entity59 's own engagement is so new she still stumbles a little when she describes @entity88 as her " fiancee			2
" but her message about why conservatives should back same - sex marriage comes through loud and clear			1
she shared it wednesday with all the @entity34 gathered for the convention in the form of a full - page ad in the @entity97 , paid for by the @entity34 and @entity32 for the @entity98			1
the ad shows several photos of same - sex couples smiling under a quote from @entity103 , president of the @entity104 , a @entity106 right think tank that is far from gay friendly			1
in his argument that successfully added anti-same sex marriage language to the party 's platform , @entity103 said , " the institution of marriage is the foundation of civil society			1
its success as an institution will determine our success as a nation			0
" @entity59 's ad goes on to say the @entity38 @entity12 groups agree with @entity103 , which is why the government should stop denying marriage licenses to gay couples			1
" the freedom to marry is directly in line with the core ideals and principles of the @entity23 -- less government , more individual freedom , personal responsibility and the importance of freedom , " it argues			1
" what i want to ask @entity103 if i see him here is , ' if you believe marriage is the very foundation of society , why would you deny us this right ? ' " @entity59 said			2
" i honestly believe it 's cruel to deny us this			2
if you believe we are real people , that is			0
" as she finishes speaking , @entity59 recognizes a man from the @entity104 riding an escalator into the carefully secured convention center and wonders whether she could catch up with him			2
until this year , @entity59 may not have had the credentials to follow him into those secured areas , at least not as a @entity12			0
one of the @entity34 's former directors says this is the first year the @entity12 has credentialed the group and saved rooms for its members in official hotel space			1
@entity158 says the evolution of the roles that openly gay people play at the convention -- and in the party itself -- has been remarkable			0
@entity158 was the chairman of the @entity34 from 1993 to 1999			1
he went on to be elected the first openly gay person in the nation to chair a state @entity23 , in the @entity169			1
early on , he says , he felt forced to stand up at a public meeting and shame the @entity12 chair into an official meeting with @entity34			2
" the current @entity12 leadership has been much better			0
they 've been great , " @entity158 said			0
" we feel so much more welcome , and the voices of the @entity177 in the party will be drowned out as more young people come into the party			0
this is not a negative issue for young people in our party			0
and we are more visible than ever			0
" proof of his statement was visible tuesday at a @entity189 dance party called " @entity190 , " where many young gay and straight convention danced in the shadow of buff go - go dancers wearing the @entity38 group 's " freedom is fabulous " t - shirts			1
at the door on the way out of the event , attendees received a convention collector 's item -- a keychain with the @entity189 logo			2
late into the evening , @entity189 co-founder @entity207 hushed the dancing crowd for a moment			0
he described how proud he was that his was the first gay @entity23 group to endorse this @entity12 presidential ticket -- even if he personally disagreed with @entity212 and @entity214 's stance against same - sex marriage			1
to him , the gay community is so mainstream within the party that @entity189 should n't solely be about gay issues			2
" as most of you know , i support civil marriage for gay couples , " @entity207 said , which drew a smattering of supportive shouts from the crowd			2
" and marriage is important			0
but before you get married , you need a date			0
and everybody knows you ca n't get a date without a job			0
