@entity0 -- twenty years after the @entity3 and its allies launched @entity5 to roll back @entity7 's invasion of @entity8 , @entity2 still owes its smaller neighbor billions in reparations and more than 1,000 people are still missing			1
it was in august 1990 that @entity2 invaded , declaring that @entity8 was its 19th province			1
the @entity3 led a counteroffensive starting january 16 , 1991			1
while the era of @entity7 is now part of history , the impact of the invasion he ordered is anything but			0
" @entity8 was of course traumatized by the invasion in 1990 , " said @entity22 of the @entity23 , which monitors conflicts around the world			2
" it has yet to overcome the fear that @entity2 will yet again want to show that @entity8 is the 19th province rather than an independent neighboring state -- and @entity8 will want some kind of guarantees that will not be repeated			2
" the @entity32 lifted @entity7 - era sanctions against @entity2 in december , a largely symbolic step toward @entity2 regaining full sovereignty and its status in the international community			0
and although its government has continued to reassure the international community that the new @entity2 is no longer a threat , @entity0 is still subject to @entity32 resolutions over its outstanding disputes with @entity8			1
more than 1,000 people -- or their remains -- are still missing , including @entity2 , @entity8 and others			1
the @entity8 government also wants back government documents that disappeared during the invasion in 1990			1
@entity2 , @entity8 and the @entity48 are working together on the missing persons			2
@entity2 is also continuing to pay off its war reparations to its neighbor			1
@entity0 says it has paid about $ 30 billion to date and still has to pay more than $ 20 billion more			2
the money is deducted from @entity2 's main income , oil revenues			1
@entity56 spokesman @entity55 says @entity2 needs money itself , and has paid enough			2
" we are subject to the deduction of 5 % of our revenue			0
that is , of course , influencing the revenue of the @entity2 people			0
it 's influencing the budget , " he said			0
" i do understand that @entity7 created damages to the others , but again , it 's enough , " he told @entity1			0
" we do need each and every penny " for " reconstruction of our destroyed country " and because the @entity2 people need services , he said			0
and while the borders between the two countries have finally been established with the help of the @entity32 , questions remain on both sides regarding rights and access , and some 200 @entity2 families must be relocated			0
in what is arguably the biggest step toward improving these strained ties , @entity8 's prime minister @entity84 visited @entity0 on wednesday , the highest - ranking @entity8 visit in decades			1
@entity2 's prime minister @entity89 is expected to make a visit to @entity8 soon			1
" now we see a thaw of sorts , we 'll have to see how far it goes , " said @entity22 of the @entity23			0
" that could lead to a peace treaty of some sort because there are some outstanding issues that need to be resolved , but all of them are resolvable , and i think if the political will is there , it can be done			0
" analysts say while there are signs of progress being made , the issue is essentially a lack of trust on both sides -- and building that trust will not be easy .			0
