-- @entity3 's @entity2 issued an order tuesday allowing lower state courts to " exercise reasonable control " over the appearance of witnesses and parties , a rule change proposed after a @entity11 woman refused to remove an @entity13 garment in a small claims court			1
a niqab is a garment that covers the entire face and head , except for the eyes			0
the order allows courts " reasonable control over the appearance of parties and witnesses " so as to " ensure that the demeanor of such persons may be observed and assessed by the fact - finder and ensure the accurate identification of such person			1
" the order , which amends a rule of the @entity31 , is effective september 1			0
the amendment was prompted by a 2006 small claims case in @entity3 filed by @entity34 , who wore a niqab -- a garment that covers the entire face and head , except for the eyes -- to court , the order said			1
according to the @entity40 , @entity34 was contesting a $ 2,750 repair bill from a car rental company because she said thieves broke into the vehicle she was using			0
as she prepared to testify , judge @entity47 asked her to remove her niqab , saying he needed to be able to see her face to tell whether she was telling the truth , according to court documents			2
" i ca n't see certain things about your demeanor and temperament that i need to see in a court of law , " @entity47 said at the time			0
@entity34 refused , saying that she was a practicing @entity11 and would take off the veil only in front of a female judge			0
@entity47 said a female judge was not available and told @entity34 she could remove the niqab or have her case dismissed -- she chose the latter , according to court documents			2
she sued the judge in federal district court , which declined to exercise jurisdiction over the case			2
@entity34 has since appealed to the 6th @entity73			0
the @entity3 chapter of the @entity75 issued a statement saying that if the amended rule was interpreted broadly , it could " not only adversely affect @entity11 females who wear the head scarf , but could also be used to violate @entity81 , @entity80 , and other people of faiths ' constitutional rights under the @entity85 while in @entity3 courts			1
" it added , " as a civil rights advocacy group , @entity75 - @entity3 is concerned about individuals who may be reluctant to report crimes or petition the courts out of fear that their religious rights may be violated			1
" other religious groups , as well as the @entity97 and domestic violence groups , had opposed the rule change , the @entity40 reported			1
the @entity97 had asked that the court add a sentence to the rule saying " that no person shall be precluded from testifying on the basis of clothing worn because of a sincerely held belief , " the newspaper reported in may			2
@entity75 also said that it would announce on wednesday the filing of a federal lawsuit against a @entity110 , @entity3 , judge who had asked a @entity11 woman to remove her head scarf in court			1
" the @entity11 plaintiff felt so intimidated by the judge 's repeated demand that she eventually removed her head scarf , " the organization said in a statement released tuesday			0
@entity75 - @entity3 is a co-plaintiff in the lawsuit being filed on behalf of the @entity3 woman , who is a member of the group			1
last month , the @entity124 of @entity125 adopted a policy allowing religious head coverings in the state 's courtrooms , the @entity123 reported .			0

courts allowed " exercise reasonable control " over appearance of witnesses
change prompted by case in which judge demanded woman remove face - covering
rule says " demeanor " must be observable , " accurate identification " ensured
@entity75 , @entity97 oppose the change
