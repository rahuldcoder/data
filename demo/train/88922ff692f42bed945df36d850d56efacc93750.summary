-- four years ago , @entity1 became @entity3 's unofficial photo - chronicler			1
with his blog , @entity4 -- which has over eight million followers on social media -- he has captured the heart and soul of the city 's multi-national inhabitants			1
his trademark -- the micro narratives that accompany each image -- has been imitated in the far reaches of the globe , from @entity17 to @entity18			1
last month , he turned his lens , and poignant interview style , to the world at large			2
in partnership with the @entity23 , he is touring roughly a dozen countries in a bid to raise awareness for the peacekeeping organization 's @entity27			1
his first stop : @entity30 and @entity31			1
' my eyes were opened ' though his trip was " months in the works , " @entity1 did n't anticipate that his arrival in @entity37 , @entity30 would coincide with that of @entity39			1
the first people he questioned were @entity41 refugees who had only freshly fled their homes , their families , their lives as a whole			2
" my idea of what constitutes personal tragedy has been expanded a lot just listening to what these people are going through , " admits @entity1			1
for the @entity41 he approached -- from the student who had to abandon his long sought after master 's degree to flee bombs to the mother whose children ca n't stop crying for home -- @entity1 found himself falter at the prospect of pursuing his traditional line of questioning			1
" when you 've just abandoned your house , and your family is surrounded by a hostile army , and you do n't know if they 're going to survive , it 's just inappropriate to ask what your happiest memory with your mother is , " he says			2
" i felt i could n't ask them beyond their present circumstances , because their lives were absolutely consumed by those circumstances			0
" ' pack a bag and get ready to run ' the day @entity1 landed in @entity30 , @entity39 captured the @entity74			1
the day he left , the @entity75 started air strikes			2
his time there , he admits , was often terrifying			0
" when i was in @entity80 , there was a moment i got a call in the middle of the night from @entity84 telling to pack a bag and get ready to run , because @entity39 was shelling the town and had broken through the lines , " he recalls			0
" it was an abundance of caution it turned out , but it was a sleepless night			0
" it was one of many moments , he admits , when he appreciated what it means to feel secure			0
" i went to this place where all people wanted was a bit of security : to send their kids to school , to start a business , to get married and live a normal life			2
and i realized that in the absence of physical security , no other layers of life can really be experienced , " he says			0
" that constant uncertainty seeps into your psyche in a way that you ca n't really pinpoint until you go back to a place that is secure			0
" for @entity1 , that place was @entity31			1
" i really noticed when i landed in @entity31 , where the infrastructures was in place and there was no imminent threat , that there was a load lifted from my psyche , " he says			1
the stories he heard were different as well			0
the tenor , though often still heart - breaking ( he visited @entity120 that houses around 80,000 @entity121 ) , demonstrated a lighter side of the human character			0
in the absence of immediate danger , there was hope			0
" the other thing this trip has made me realize is the depth of ambition , particularly in underdeveloped countries , " he says			0
" everybody i talked to had such big dreams , and often such limited opportunities with which to achieve those dreams			0

@entity1 launched humans of @entity3 blog
partnering with @entity23 , he 's on a world tour that started in @entity30 and @entity31
