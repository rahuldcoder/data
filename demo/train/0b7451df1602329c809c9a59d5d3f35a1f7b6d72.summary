@entity0 @entity3 and @entity4 negotiators preparing to square off in @entity5 next week over @entity3 's nuclear ambitions will also be eying another showdown brewing in @entity0			1
one year after a @entity9 - led coalition in the @entity11 came up just short of a deal , @entity9 lawmakers are poised to wield their new power in the @entity11 to push a bill authorizing additional sanctions against @entity3			1
but the new 54 - member majority does n't guarantee that @entity9 can muster the 67 votes they need to override a presidential veto , and the fight is already underway for the votes that could fill the gap			1
with fewer than two months until diplomats ' march 1 framework agreement deadline , and expecting the @entity25 to start knocking on swing senators ' doors , supporters know the clock is ticking to pass a sanctions bill they say will ratchet up pressure on @entity3			1
but for opponents of additional sanctions , the ticking is more like a time bomb as a sanctions bill will torpedo negotiations and set the @entity4 on a path to war with @entity3 , they claim			1
for sen. @entity42 , the @entity9 half of the @entity45 sanctions bill he has pushed for the last three years , the sooner a sanctions bill hits the @entity11 floor , the better -- both politically and policy-wise			1
" if the @entity11 was allowed to vote tomorrow , i would be able to get two - thirds , " @entity42 said sunday in a phone interview			1
" now is the time to put pressure on @entity3 especially with oil prices so low			1
we are uniquely advantaged at this time to shut down this nuclear program			0
" sen. @entity54 ( r - @entity55 ) , another major proponent of the legislation , told @entity1 last month the @entity45 bill " will come up for a vote in january , " a pledge he made the same day to @entity61 prime minister @entity60 in a meeting in @entity63			0
@entity42 said he backed that timing but insisted that it depends on senate majority leader @entity66			2
a @entity68 spokesman called the legislation " a priority , " but said there is n't yet a schedule for a sanctions bill			2
@entity9 have been clamoring for additional sanctions on @entity3 , but with control of @entity77 in their hands , @entity9 lawmakers will also have to own the consequences of sanctions legislation -- which the president , @entity82 and @entity3 officials have warned could derail negotiations			1
" we have long believed that @entity77 should not consider any new sanctions while negotiations are underway , in order to give our negotiators the time and space they need to fully test the current diplomatic opportunity			0
new sanctions threaten the diplomatic process currently underway , " a senior administration official told @entity1			0
the @entity45 bill that died in the @entity11 last year would reimpose sanctions on @entity3 if @entity96 could n't certify that @entity3 does n't finance terror groups that have attacked @entity4 and would keep @entity3 from maintaining low - level nuclear enrichment in a final deal , just a few terms that are much stricter than the current framework for negotiations between @entity3 and the @entity104 world powers			1
those congressional provisions are " poison pills , " according to @entity106 , head of government affairs at @entity107 , a group that bills itself as @entity109			0
it lobbied heavily on the issue last year and is ramping up for another forceful push			2
" all of these things are poison pills , far from the clean sanctions , just - if - things - go - wrong idea , " @entity106 said			2
" we know that many if not most of the people pushing for legislation do n't want diplomacy to work			0
" @entity107 challenges the @entity61 lobby from within @entity42 has already been working with sen. @entity125 , of @entity126 , his @entity127 partner on the bill , to rework some of its language -- changes that could potentially draw more @entity127 support			2
the pair are still working on final language for the bill , which drew 59 cosponsors last year , though @entity42 said he is working to stave off as many changes as possible -- " the more changes , the worse , " he said			2
the @entity138 @entity9 expects a high - profile challenge from the @entity25 and its allies , but he will be getting his own backup from some @entity143 heavyweights : the @entity142 , or @entity142 , which typically spends more than $ 2.5 million a year on lobbying , according to the @entity145			2
" i think they 're pretty damned strong			0
this would be the no. 1 thing for them , " @entity42 said of @entity142			0
intense lobbying from @entity142 could help the sanctions supporters win back the four @entity127 who joined 13 others in cosponsoring the sanctions bill last year , but later backtracked their support			1
sens. @entity156 of @entity157 , @entity158 of @entity159 , @entity160 of @entity161 and @entity162 of @entity163 rejected the idea of moving forward amid negotiations after the @entity25 and allies made its push on @entity143 to keep the measure from a floor vote			0
" i did not sign it with the intention that it would ever be voted upon or used upon while we were negotiating , " @entity158 said on @entity170 after @entity96 talked about @entity3 in his @entity172 address			1
" i signed it because i wanted to make sure the president had a hammer if he needed it and showed them how determined we were to do it and use it if we had to			0
" after talks failed to materialize into an agreement by the november 2014 deadline , some @entity127 have started to lose patience with the stop - and - stall pace of negotiations with @entity3 and are facing pressure from groups like @entity142 to support a sanctions bill , though the @entity25 insists the negotiations have yielded tangible results : rolling back @entity3 's nuclear program during negotiations			1
but even if @entity42 , @entity45 and their allies can pressure those four @entity127 into signing on , they will need to pull three more @entity197 who did n't cosponsor the bill last year to secure the 15 democrats needed to override a presidential veto			1
and they wo n't just be targeted by @entity142			0
a coalition of dove organizations is already putting the gears in motion for what they expect to be the toughest battle yet on this issue , and while they 're clear - eyed about the uphill climb they face , they dismiss the overconfident stride of pro-sanctions leaders			0
these groups will look to paint any new sanctions as a step onto the warpath with @entity3 and show wary @entity127 that they have the grassroots backing to stave off attacks from groups like @entity142			1
@entity220 defends @entity96 on @entity3 talks more than 400 faith leaders and activists traveled to @entity0 in late november to lobby @entity77 against the sanctions in a day of action organized by the @entity226 , a quaker - founded organization , and the group plans to drive its 50,000 supporters to flood @entity77 with calls and letters in the weeks ahead			1
" the real trick that we have to do is really to make that opposition -- both in the public and that opposition on @entity240 -- to really make it become public and to amplify those voices , " said @entity231 , the group 's lead lobbyist on the issue			0
" because right now you hear from , it 's @entity54 and ( @entity246 ) @entity245 , who are very confident in their prognosis and have made it sound like it 's inevitable that these sanctions will pass with a veto - proof majority			1
" to accomplish that , @entity226 has worked with other groups like @entity107 and about 70 other groups in an expanding coalition opposing the sanctions in an effort to paint the debate not as a benchmark for support for @entity61 , but rather what @entity231 calls a " wider , anti-war issue " that resonates with a war - weary public			2
that 's where groups like @entity268 come in			0
the group , which represents more than 400,000 pro-peace veterans and their families , is looking to drive home the risks and repercussions of war			0
" as a veteran i was sent to @entity278 and you know there are still ambiguous causes for that conflict			0
we rushed in with bad intel and it could have been a very avoidable situation , " said @entity283 , who leads the group 's grassroots effort against the sanctions bill			0
" i know firsthand the consequences of failed negotiations			0

**republicans** are poised to wield their new @entity11 majority to push new @entity3 sanctions
but the fight is n't won as a presidential veto looms and opponents gear up to stave off a veto - proof majority
**republicans** will need 15 @entity127 to sign on for a veto - proof majority , *including* 7 who backed off last year or did n't sign on at all
