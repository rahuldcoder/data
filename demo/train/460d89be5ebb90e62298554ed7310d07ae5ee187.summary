" if the @entity6 agree [ on @entity56 's departure ] between each other , we will only be happy to support such a solution , " @entity9 said			2
" but we believe it is unacceptable to impose the conditions for such a dialogue from outside			0
" @entity9 's comments came on a day when intense fighting flared across @entity6 and after many hours of international discussions this week on how to get the failing peace plan back on track			1
at least 96 people , including many women and children , were killed saturday , said the opposition @entity79			1

the @entity6 state news agency discounted the opposition account of what happened in @entity187 , citing in its report a witness from the village who claimed to have seen armed terrorist groups carry out the attack			1
