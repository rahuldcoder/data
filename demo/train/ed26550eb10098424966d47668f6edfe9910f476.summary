-- @entity1 , who plays for the @entity2 , was arrested august 31 on felony domestic violence charges involving his pregnant fiancee			1
the @entity5 said @entity1 's fiancee had " visible injuries , " and the @entity7 reported that police were previously called to his house in may			0
@entity1 is out on bail while the case is under investigation by the district attorney 's office			0
he is due in court on september 15 and has yet to be charged			0
but none of this stopped @entity1 from playing on sunday in the 49ers season opener , a decision the @entity21 just denounced			0
they 've called for @entity1 to be sidelined ( with pay ) pending the outcome of the september 15 court appearance			0
do we need cell phone video of every assault to make the @entity29 pick up the ball ? apparently we do			1
there 's @entity32 of the @entity33 , who was convicted in july on domestic violence charges			1
think he 's in jail or suspended indefinitely like @entity36 ? nope -- under @entity29 commissioner @entity38 's leadership , he 's on the field			1
and there are many other examples where the @entity29 looked the other way or was way too lenient			2
@entity36 has been punished for his despicable elevator assault on @entity44 , who 's now his wife			1
now it 's time for the @entity29 to be punished for its despicable handling of it			1
the @entity29 commissioner , @entity38 , must go			1
with @entity38 in charge , nothing is going to change the next time another player is charged with felony domestic violence			1
and next time is already here			0
under his leadership , the @entity29 and the @entity52 have handled the incident so horrendously that they 're guilty of abusing @entity57 too			1
only @entity61 rubbing @entity38 's nose in this pile of dung forced the @entity29 to react			1
without @entity61 releasing the video of @entity36 's assault , current and former @entity29 players would n't have gone nuts condemning him on social media			1
without the video , @entity36 was going to play 14 games this season , earn commission as a character in the @entity73 ' 15 video game , and enjoy lucrative contracts with endorsers like @entity76 -- and that was just fine with the commissioner and the @entity52			1
you might wonder why the @entity29 did n't see the surveillance video			2
@entity38 told @entity81 ( the network that broadcasts @entity29 games ) that he " did n't know what was on that tape			1
" but he knew @entity36 hit her unconscious			2
he knew there was surveillance inside the elevator			0
perhaps he did n't care to watch it			0
he wanted to get back to what 's important : playing football			0
the @entity29 abused @entity57 when it did n't suspend @entity36 immediately			1
@entity29 officials abused her by allegedly having him present as they interviewed her for their " investigation , " putting her in an impossible situation			2
then the @entity52 put her in the position of defending her abuser			0
they held a press conference where she apologized for the " role " she played			0
@entity36 also apologized " to everyone who was affected by this situation that me and my wife were in , " but not to his wife			2
would you rat out the man who cold - cocked you while he 's sitting next to you ? want to be the one " responsible " for making him lose his job ? they abused her yet again when the @entity52 ' official @entity114 account tweeted " @entity36 : ' i wo n't call myself a failure			2
failure is not getting knocked down			0
it 's not getting up			0
' " and the @entity29 sent @entity57 a very clear message when it handed her husband a two - game suspension : " this was n't that serious , honey -- stand by your man			1
" head coach @entity125 welcomed @entity36 back to the team , as " a heck of a guy			2
" six months after being assaulted , @entity57 should be allowed to focus on healing			2
instead she 's now reeling from yet another punch -- this latest one from , surprise , the @entity29			2
she deserved better -- from her husband , from the @entity52 and from the @entity29			2
of course she 's lashing out and blaming everyone but @entity36 for this " nightmare			2
" she 's a battered woman			0
imagine if the @entity29 had handled this the right way back when the original assault took place			1
it would have sidelined @entity36 , pending an investigation			0
it would have talked to @entity44 privately , with a trained advocate present , and made it comfortable for her to be honest			0
it would have handed @entity36 a suspension for the season and supported him through counseling			0
one more thing : for the women in the media , like @entity148 , who are calling @entity44 a " delusional " victim -- shame on you			0
you show a stunning lack of knowledge about domestic violence and the reasons why victims feel so paralyzed			1
by blaming her , you isolate her and make it harder for her to leave			0
i suggest you try searching for the now - trending hashtag # whyistayed to educate yourself about what victims go through and why battered women 's syndrome makes them stay			1
@entity36 has been dealt with			0
the @entity167 ' marriage and his career will be tested over time			0
@entity1 was charged in august with felony domestic violence charges and is still playing football , and that 's okay with @entity38			1
@entity32 was convicted of domestic violence charges in july and he 's still playing for the league			1
think the @entity29 takes domestic violence seriously ? neither do @entity175 -- it 's time you go			1
where 's @entity179 when you need him ?			0

@entity182 : @entity29 let other players charged in domestic violence return to field
@entity187 : @entity36 punished , once there was video -- why not others ? @entity38 must go
@entity29 abused @entity57 , she says ; her defense of @entity36 *typical* of battered women
@entity187 : imagine if @entity29 had handled case properly and all *parties* had gotten needed help
