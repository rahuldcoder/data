-- there are just 50 days to go until the @entity2 begin in @entity3 , but for some people the pinnacle of the sporting year arrived last week in the @entity7 -- one of @entity10 's most picturesque locations			1
shin - kicking is not counted as one of the 36 @entity2 sports , but it is a key event at @entity15 's " @entity14 " " -- an ancient event which is 400 years old in 2012			1
@entity16 was a shin - kicker			1
he wears a benevolent smile framed by a beard in the style of a 17th century yeoman			2
he 's dressed accordingly in a baggy - sleeved shirt and breeches , but he also has a darker side			1
having reached the @entity24 of shin - kicking -- a place in the @entity28 final -- he fell short of the summit and he retired from competition to become an @entity28 judge			1
@entity32 : " i can break 100m world record " " shin - kicking is probably the blue riband event and i 'm probably biased because i judge it but it is the sport that people come to see , " @entity16 told @entity0			1
and they come to see it in their thousands , as they have done for four centuries			2
the @entity44 takes place on a hillside above the @entity48 town of @entity49 , whose honey - colored stone houses and thatched cottages contribute to its reputation as one of the most sought - after residences in @entity10			1
the event was the idea of a lawyer , @entity15 , who received the blessing of @entity60 to transform an existing whitsun fair into a series of games modeled on the old @entity65 ideal of strength and endeavor			1
ancient events like the tug - of - war and standing jump made it into early editions of the modern @entity2			1
shin - kicking did not			1
why @entity74 must win @entity2 basketball gold " shin - kicking , certainly in the way we do it today , is very little changed from the way they did it in 1612 , " says @entity16			1
" in those days they probably would n't have called it shin - kicking they would have called it ' @entity14 wrestling ' but the rules were so loose that the only things you could n't do was gouge or bite , so everything else was allowed and shin - kicking was a natural way to weaken your opponent			1
" shin - kicker @entity94 knows all the right moves to weaken an opponent			1
he has shin - kicking in his blood and i suspect the blood of several opponents ' shins on his boots			1
his dad is chairman of the @entity105 and his family is steeped in the history of the sport			2
. " well it all started because you 've got the lowlands down there and us high - men up here and you would come to the middle to sort out the differences between yourselves and because you did n't want it to become too bad they agreed on this form of wrestling where basically in them days it was the first man to get a broken leg was the loser			1
" as @entity94 continues i wonder just what might constitute " too bad			2
" " it got pretty brutal in those days as well , steel toecaps were allowed and the lads used to beat their legs with wooden mallets to toughen up the bone and skin and all the muscle			2
" @entity94 explains to what extent the sport has changed since then			2
" well we banned the steel toe - caps so basically we do it now till the man is tripped over			2
i think broken legs were a common occurrence and some nasty injuries , whereas , although we have some nasty injuries we very rarely have broken bones			0
" another sop to the soft - hearted 21st - century modern man is the option of using straw to pad your socks and hopefully cushion the blows			2
@entity94 forgoes such pampering and opts for the bare - skin shin of the extreme kicker			1
choosing ridicule over raw pain i stuff my socks with handfuls -- " wodges " as they are known in the sport -- of scratchy straw until my lower limbs resemble bloated woolly sausages			2
but @entity94 is about to light the barbecue and i 'm destined for the grill			0
before i rise to the challenge @entity16 chips in with a bit of advice			0
" the main key ingredient you need to be a successful shin - kicker is surprisingly not strong shins but stamina			1
so you need a good sense of balance , you need stamina and you need to be able to land a few good kicks as well			0
" encouraged by this information i ask : " what are your legs like the next day ? " the answer is less encouraging			0
" they 're very , very painful			0
in fact it 's not just the first day			0
the first time i did it , it was six months before they stopped being painful			0
" do n't worry , i 'll go easy on you , " says a grinning @entity94			0
" but first you 've got to put on your shepherd 's smock			0
we 're in sheep country , so originally it was all shepherds who fought			0
" i haul the unflattering brown garment over my head and @entity94 grabs me by the shoulders ready to begin his masterclass			0
desperate to delay the inevitable defeat , i say : " wait ... let 's talk a little bit about technique			0
" my opponent smiles again : " not much -- attack and block , hack and slash , no headbutts and we shake hands at the end			0
" we followed that script pretty much to the letter and i lasted barely 30 seconds before being sent tumbling head over heels			0
as i watched the real competition get underway , i realized that @entity94 the @entity218 really had been easy on me			0
booted battles were greeted with great cheers from the crowd			0
some bouts lasted a draining ten minutes , others barely seconds as a hefty hoof brought down another pretender to the throne			0
but as 1980s action film @entity228 tells us , there can be only one and when @entity232 ( rather than @entity2 ) are discussed in these parts , neither @entity32 nor @entity234 will be the name spoken in terms of the highest reverence			0
it is the name of @entity239 , a 23 - year - old stone mason from the neighboring county of @entity241			2
it is he who , on the 400th anniversary of the @entity14 , bears the title of @entity247 .			1

the @entity249 start in 50 days
the @entity44 are an ancient event which dates back to 1612
shin - kicking is the main event at the @entity14 , which take place in @entity10
the sport is much the same as it was when it was first competed 400 years *ago*
