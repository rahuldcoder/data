-- it 's hard to keep up with so many statistics about modern parenting , but here 's one that floored me when i heard it a few years ago : by 4 , children living in poverty hear 30 million fewer words than children in higher income households , according to researchers			1
thirty million ! that is horrendous , but it gets worse : hearing fewer words leads to learning fewer words , which means children start kindergarten with smaller vocabularies and a so - called " word gap			1
" often , they ca n't catch up when it comes to academic readiness and long - term achievement , studies have found			2
this week , the @entity26 announced new guidelines that encourage doctors to talk to parents not just about nutrition and illnesses but about the importance of reading out loud , singing and talking during an infant 's first days			1
" fewer than half of children younger than 5 years old are read to daily in our country , " the group 's president , @entity34 , said in a statement			1
" the benefits are so compelling that encouraging reading at young children 's check - ups has become an essential component of our care			1
" pediatricians see 16 million children 5 and younger every year in the @entity47 , said @entity48 , co-director of @entity49 to fail , a joint initiative of the @entity51 and @entity52 , which is focused on helping parents close the " word gap " and improve the lives of children			2
" so getting this word out through pediatricians and having them recommend to parents and support reading out loud to their children starting in infancy is so amazing and critically important , " @entity48 said			1
my husband and i read aloud to our girls , 6 and 8 , every day from the minute they were born , and we still do it during breakfast or before bedtime			0
their love of reading shows us they have certainly benefited , and it truly pains me to think about their peers who might have missed out before enrolling in elementary school			0
president @entity78 , in a video released by the @entity77 on wednesday , saluted the move by the doctor 's group in connection with @entity83 to fail to help " bridge the word gap ' " and increase children 's chances of success later in life			1
" we know that ... if a black or @entity91 child is n't ready for kindergarten , they 're half as likely to finish middle school with strong academic and social skills , " @entity78 said			2
" by giving more of our kids access to high - quality preschool and other early learning programs -- and by helping parents get the tools they need to help their kids succeed -- we can give those kids a better shot at the career they 're capable of , and the life that will make us all better off			1
" the key is getting the message to parents who too often do n't realize the importance of reading aloud , talking and singing in the early years , @entity48 said			1
" while this is a big gap , the good news is that the solution is pretty straightforward and we know that if we can get this important message out to parents about why you need to talk , read and sing , it can go a long way in terms of ameliorating this word gap , " she added			2
the mission has some bipartisan support			0
@entity49 to fail released videos wednesday of @entity119 , wife of @entity120 @entity121 sen. @entity120 , former @entity123 sen. @entity122 and @entity124 , who are teaming up to raise awareness about the importance of early literacy			1
@entity128 talked about how she sang to her daughter , @entity131 , every night when she was a baby			0
when @entity131 finally mouthed " no sing , mommy , no sing , " @entity128 went back to reading , she said in the video			2
" @entity135 , reading or just talking is an important part of not only my daughter 's brain development , but every child 's , " @entity128 said			0
" thanks to new research , we know that children 's brains light up and make new connections when their parents speak to them from the earliest days , but many of our youngest kids are n't getting the support they need to grow and thrive			1
" said @entity119 , " as a parent and former teacher , i 'm very familiar with the way a child 's eyes light up when he or she first starts to understand a new concept			0
every moment a parent spends with a child , talking , singing , reading a bedtime story is an opportunity to make a lifelong impact in the child 's life			0
" as part of the effort , @entity167 is donating 500,000 books for children up to 3 years old during the next year			0
the books will be distributed to 20,000 medical providers nationwide to be given to families during pediatrician visits			0
the @entity26 of @entity176 and @entity83 to fail are also developing a toolkit to help doctors teach parents how they can add more communication with their infants and toddlers to every day activities such as diaper changes , meal time , bath time and bus rides			1
" parents do n't have a lot of extra time			0
they 're working , they 're often working multiple jobs and doing their best to get everything done in a day so what we 're trying to do is make these tips very simple and straightforward , " @entity48 said			0
if you have an infant or a toddler or you know anyone who does , encourage them to sing , talk and read aloud to their littlest ones			2
those activities are just as important as making sure they get all the food and sleep they need to thrive			0
for more resources on how to communicate with your infant or toddler , check out tips here from @entity83 to @entity214			0
