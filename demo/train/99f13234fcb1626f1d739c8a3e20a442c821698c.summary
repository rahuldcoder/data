-- you know how good it feels when you fish a $ 10 bill out of your jeans pocket right before it hits the wash			1
imagine coming into hundreds of dollars from a savings bond or a bank account you forgot about			2
could there be a pile of money waiting for you to find it ? you may get a letter from a company saying you have unclaimed money or property , and for a fee , you 'll be able to reclaim it			1
but before you pay for this service , remember there are plenty of free web sites that will help reunite you with your treasures			2

property is considered abandoned if there has been no activity on it for more than three years , according to @entity43 of @entity44			0
such money is turned over to the state of your last known address , and the state holds the money in its coffers until you or your heirs claim it			2
there is no time limit to claim most abandoned property			0
in fact , years from now , your great - great grandchildren could claim it			0
to find your hidden money , go to http://www.missingmoney.com / , an official database for the @entity44 that has records from most state unclaimed property programs			1
you can also link to your individual state unclaimed property program			2
if you come across records that indicate there may be money left in an old bank account , find out if the bank is still in business			1
for that , go to the @entity71 's web site at www.fdic.gov			1
look under " @entity72 , " and you 'll be able to see the history of the bank , including any mergers			0
but if your bank failed , and you do n't claim those funds within a year and a half , the money in your account is turned over to the @entity71			1
to search for the failed bank , go to www2.fdic.gov / funds / index.asp			0
if you do n't claim the money after a few years , you 'll lose what 's in your account , says @entity88 of the @entity71			1
" there 's quite a bit of unclaimed property out there , " he says			1
savings bonds anything you 're supposed to keep for 30 years is bound to slip your mind			0
in fact , there are more than $ 15 billion worth of savings bonds that have stopped earning interest but have n't been claimed , according to the @entity101			1
if you have savings bonds that are still earning interest , but you have no idea where the documents are or how much they 're worth , get in touch with the record - keeping office of the @entity101			1
as long as you have enough information -- like when the bonds were issued or the social security number on the bond -- the @entity101 will replace or reissue your bond			1
if you stumble across savings bonds that have stopped earning interest , or you think you may have had a bond or two as a kid , go to treasurydirect.gov / indiv / indiv.htm and look under " @entity118			0
" this search mechanism will tell you if there are any bonds in your name			0

" we want to get those off our books , " says @entity135 of the @entity101			1
" it does n't do us any good to be hanging on to the funds			0
" pensions pensions may be going the way of the dinosaur , but there 's still plenty of cash left from people who forgot to claim them			1
there 's about $ 133 million in unclaimed pension funds , says @entity152 of the @entity153 , the federal pension insurance program			1
about 32,000 people may have pension money just sitting around			0

there , you can type in your name and company in a search tool			0
finding unexpected cash is n't hard as long as you know where to look			0
if an asset locator contacts you about unclaimed property , take the time to use the search tools			0
asset locators generally charge a 10 to 20 percent fee to find your unclaimed funds			2
while this can be a legitimate service , you 're being asked to pay for something you can do for free			0
" these asset finders are providing something of value , " says @entity183 of @entity184 , a nonprofit consumer watchdog group			0
" but you can do it yourself with a few mouse clicks			0
