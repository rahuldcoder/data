@entity0 -- moments after @entity5 had nearly decapitated his victim , the @entity4 soldier @entity3 , he turned to one of the numerous cameras trained on him and his accomplice @entity9 , and said : " the only reason we have killed this man today is because @entity13 are dying daily by @entity4 soldiers			1
and this @entity4 soldier is one			0
it is an @entity17 and a tooth for a tooth			0
we swear by the almighty @entity20 we will never stop fighting you until you leave us alone			0
" here @entity5 was , perhaps unwittingly , following one of the oldest philosophies in modern terrorism : the propaganda of the deed			1
conceptualized by @entity29 and @entity30 anarchists during the mid to late 19th century , it refers to the terrorist 's belief in the didactic power of violence which they see as necessary not only to draw attention to a cause but to inform and educate people about their movement in the hope that it will encourage increased recruitment			1
thus , @entity3 's killers did not attack the shocked and curious passers - by in @entity44 who began to film them , and instead invited the curious gaze of their smart phones			1
this murder was not an irrational act of madness , but a calm and calculated effort both to strike a blow for what they see as @entity13 oppressed by @entity55 forces around the world , and to publicize the cause of the global jihad far and wide			1
in order to maintain a presence in the @entity61 , the global jihad movement that was sparked by @entity63 on september 11 , 2001 requires effective propagandists			1
such individuals help to define grievances , as well as formulate responses and offer motivation			0
in doing so , they are able to offer a version of global jihadist ideology that resonates with the experiences of @entity13 living in the @entity61			1
while @entity5 should not be seen as a key leadership figure or propagandist , his act should be regarded in the same light			1
indeed , @entity5 was also known among members of the extremist group which radicalized him for giving sermons on street corners , where he would emulate well - known propagandists , seeking to replicate their work on a smaller scale			1
in a 2009 video which emerged after @entity3 's murder , he is shown leading his group 's protests against an @entity90 organization that was calling for the shut - down of a mosque in north @entity0			1
" they are pigs , " he shouted , referring to the @entity90 demonstrators , while also encouraging his audience to " not be scared of the kuffar [ unbelievers ]			0
" the @entity44 attackers emerged from an ideological milieu which sees the @entity61 as engaged in wide - ranging efforts to destroy @entity101 and subjugate @entity13			1
in response , members of this milieu support acts of violence			2
some believe that this violence only has a place in warzones involving @entity13 , while others add to their target list the home soil of the @entity55 countries involved in these conflicts			2
@entity5 and @entity9 are clearly from the latter category , and so would have been many of those with whom they interacted on a regular basis			2
however , when faced with a grouping like this , it is often very difficult for security services to determine which among them will graduate from non-violent activism of the sort that @entity5 was engaged with in 2009 , and take part in violence			1
@entity5 , however , had already been known to authorities as he was arrested by @entity130 security forces in 2010 after travelling there with the intention of joining the @entity134 - linked militia @entity133			1
this act of mobilization should have made him stand out from his @entity4 extremist peers as among the most likely to carry out an attack on home soil , and yet it appears he was allowed back onto the streets of @entity0 without any sort of monitoring of his movements			2
the details behind why he was not charged or extensively monitored after attempting to join a proscribed terrorist group are unknown , but @entity4 authorities have faced some awkward questions about this revelation			0
in future , an attempt to join up with a global jihadist group abroad , while not necessarily an indicator of a desire to take part in violence back home , should nonetheless be regarded as a step in the wrong direction			0
when looking at how authorities can respond to the wider problem of homegrown radicalization and the role of propagandists , one should begin with accepting the limitations of what can be done			0
what @entity5 and @entity9 did last spring is , at least in a planning and execution sense , incredibly easy to replicate and difficult to detect and protect against			2
thus , no government should be expected to fully guarantee against similar attacks in the future			0
the propagandists who assist in domestic radicalization often do not directly call for violence and stay within the legal parameters of free speech			2
nonetheless , either via the @entity176 or in face - to - face interactions they use highly inflammatory language and promote extreme interpretations of @entity101 , both of which play a role in the radicalization process			1
in order to protect against this , @entity55 countries could seek to pursue legislation that curbs free speech or censors the web			0
the question is how much do we want our society to change in response to this ongoing threat ? attacks like that in @entity44 are relatively rare in the @entity61			1
this is instructive , and should serve as a reminder that we are dealing with an extremist minority that can not simply be ignored or erased from our consciousness through bans and proscriptions			0
the strength of a truly liberal society is not based on its ability to ban things which it does n't like , but on the power of its ideas to equip the vast majority of its population with the ability to recognise , reject and confront illiberal and violent ideologies			0
@entity3 and others like him have paid the ultimate price for our open society , as will others in the future			0
this is not , however , a call for a grim acceptance of the status quo			0
it is a realistic assessment of the threat we face , and there is still much that can be done without infringing on basic liberties			0
civil society is key here , and we must seek to further cultivate strategies that help to delegitimize illiberal ideologies such as global jihadism in the eyes of vulnerable @entity13			0
it is our responsibility to make sure that the deaths of @entity3 and others will never be in vain , and use events such as @entity44 as catalysts to develop strong responses to this threat without compromising the very foundations of our society			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity251 .			2
