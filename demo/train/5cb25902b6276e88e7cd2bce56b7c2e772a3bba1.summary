@entity0 -- republicans and @entity3 in the @entity4 agreed thursday that they would prefer a new education bill to the current use of waivers by the @entity9 administration that bypass the @entity10 , which is more than five years overdue for an overhaul			1
" the bottom line is that it expired in 2007 except for a provision that says if @entity19 did n't act , it would continue ; and @entity19 did n't act , so it 's continuing , " said sen. @entity13 , @entity14 , the ranking @entity15 on the @entity16			1
" that 's our fault			2
that 's on us , " @entity13 added			2
education secretary @entity23 appeared before the committee to give an update on his use of waivers for states who are unable to meet the criteria set out in the @entity31 so the state can still receive federal education funding until @entity19 reauthorizes the program			1
" providing waivers was always , always our plan @entity38 but i was not willing to stand idly by and do nothing while students and educators continue to suffer under @entity10 , " the secretary said			1
the waivers have been controversial among republicans who object to the stipulations that the @entity9 administration puts onto many states before they are awarded			0
" this simple waiver authority has turned into a conditional waiver with the secretary basically having more authority to make decisions that in my view should be made locally by state and local governments , " @entity13 said			2
if @entity19 comes up with a deal to reauthorize @entity10 , which is the current version of the @entity57 ( @entity57 ) , @entity23 said his understanding is that the waivers would become obsolete			1
according to the education secretary , 34 states and the @entity0 have been granted the waivers while nine states , @entity62 and the @entity63 have requests under consideration			1
the deadline to apply for the waivers is at the end of february			0
during the last @entity19 a bill out of the @entity4 committee to reauthorize @entity57 , that bill died at the end of the session without ever making it to the @entity4 floor for debate			0
a series of smaller bills were passed out of the @entity77 that dealt with @entity57 topics last year			0
one of those bills that dealt with @entity79 made it to the @entity77 floor for debate and was passed , but died at the end of the last session with no action from the @entity4			0
" it 's no secret that for many years @entity19 has been dysfunctional , " @entity23 said			2
" my team and i put in hundreds and hundreds of hours in what proved to be a fruitless effort over the past two years			0
in all candor , i would like to have gone to waivers earlier			0

*inaction* by @entity19 has left @entity10 in effect despite 2007 *sunset*
" that 's our fault . that 's on us , " says sen. @entity13 , @entity14
education secretary *defends* the waiver process as employed by the administration
@entity15 have *complained* about conditions placed on waivers
