president @entity1 has yet to decide whether to authorize air strikes against @entity4 targets in @entity5 , the @entity0 insists			1
more and more , though , the signals and nuance from the administration and the military suggest such a campaign could be coming			1
here is a look at signs the @entity14 could be planning to expand air attacks on the @entity17 jihadists rampaging through northern @entity18 : look before you launch a @entity14 official told @entity21 that @entity1 has authorized reconnaissance flights over @entity5 that are seen as a forerunner of possible @entity14 airstrikes there against @entity4 , which calls itself @entity25			1
at the same time , the @entity14 military and intelligence communities are gathering information on the locations of @entity4 leadership and troop concentrations in @entity5 , according to two @entity14 officials			1
@entity1 authorizes reconnaissance flights over @entity5 , @entity14 official says @entity35 spokesman rear adm. @entity34 , speaking generally , told @entity21 on monday that " you certainly want to get as much of a view on the ground as you can , as much situational awareness as you can " in order to conduct operations in @entity5			1
laying the groundwork @entity1 's top military man , @entity44 chairman gen. @entity43 , last week provided the fundamental reasoning for going after @entity4 in @entity5			1
" can they be defeated without addressing that part of their organization which resides in @entity5 ? the answer is no , " @entity43 told reporters			1
" that will have to be addressed on both sides of what is essentially at this point a nonexistent border " with @entity18			0
the @entity14 military began airstrikes against @entity4 positions in @entity18 earlier this month , helping @entity61 and @entity18 forces halt the @entity64 extremists ' murderous advance			0
one reason given by the administration for the aerial campaign was to protect military advisers previously sent to @entity18 to work with @entity18 and @entity61 forces			2
5 key questions in the fight against @entity4 the same rationale of protecting @entity14 personnel and interests can be applied to expanding airstrikes across the border easily exploited by @entity4			0
" while the president has not made a decision to take additional military actions at this time , we do n't restrict our options by geographic boundaries when it comes to the central mission of protecting our people , " @entity78 spokeswoman @entity77 said monday			2
now the question becomes establishing that @entity4 poses a direct threat and building enough international and domestic support to act			0
the video of @entity4 beheading @entity14 journalist @entity92 helps make the case , as does the estimated 2,000 or so foreigners including @entity95 and @entity14 fighting for @entity4 who could return home			0
@entity1 will host a meeting of leaders of the @entity99 next month to discuss the threat of foreign fighters in @entity4			2
going into @entity5 last week , his former point man on @entity5 , @entity102 , told @entity21 that a failed @entity14 mission to rescue @entity92 earlier this year established a precedent of @entity14 forces entering @entity5 territory without government permission			2
on monday , @entity0 spokesman @entity108 cited the @entity14 mission that killed @entity109 in @entity110 as another example of going into a country without government permission to protect the safety or interests of @entity14			2
in a speech tuesday to the @entity117 , @entity1 mentioned increased @entity14 assistance for @entity61 forces in @entity18 fighting @entity4 as well as moderate opposition forces in @entity5 battling both @entity4 and the government of president @entity122			1
by lumping together the @entity123 and @entity5 opposition , @entity1 signaled his view of the conflict as a regional one regardless of the two countries involved			1
defense secretary @entity129 later announced that seven countries had joined the @entity14 in providing " urgently needed arms and equipment " to the @entity61 forces			0
those are : @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142 , he said			0
" operations have already begun and will accelerate in the coming days with more nations also expected to contribute , " @entity144 's statement said			0
is @entity1 heading toward airstrikes in @entity5 ? regional support at the @entity117 national convention , @entity1 also touted the nation 's ability to galvanize international coalitions to respond to crises			1
" history teaches us of the dangers of overreaching and spreading ourselves too thin , and trying to go it alone without international support , " he said			0
according to @entity102 , an @entity160 senior fellow , the president would seek such international support now to take on @entity4			0
key members would be @entity164 allies that have air power provided by the @entity14 , he said			0
two such countries -- @entity167 and @entity168 -- reportedly launched airstrikes this week on @entity171 targets in the ongoing @entity173 conflict			0
in addition , @entity14 allies in the region dealing with a rise in @entity64 extremism have condemned @entity4 over the beheading of @entity92 and other atrocities			0
political pressure hawkish @entity182 such as sens. @entity183 of @entity184 and @entity185 of @entity186 have long called for @entity1 to get involved militarily in @entity5 's civil war , at least by arming the opposition trying to topple @entity122			1
the lightning advance by @entity4 from @entity5 across northern @entity18 in recent months escalated criticism of @entity1 for his reticence in @entity5 , and now a broad swath of @entity182 voices demands a strong military response			1
even @entity1 's former secretary of state , @entity195 , has made clear she advocated a bigger @entity14 role in the @entity5 conflict when it began three years ago			1
with congressional elections looming in november and a presidential vote in two years , such questioning only will increase			0
while the critics cite a strategic argument , conservatives see an opportunity to simultaneously push for two core goals -- building up the military after cuts under @entity1 , and reducing resources available to the rest of what they consider to be excessive government .			2
