-- @entity1 knows , @entity2 is miserable now			0
@entity4 's breakout pro-hunting hit " @entity5 " returned wednesday night to record ratings			1
the season three premiere delivered 8.6 million viewers			1
it 's not only the most - watched " @entity5 " episode ever , it 's @entity4 's most - watched telecast ever and ranks as cable 's biggest reality show telecast so far this year			1

@entity17 , a full 5 million of the viewers were in the adults 18 - 49 demo			1
the return of " @entity5 " benefited from an unexpected gift - from - the - pr - gods when @entity25 singer and animal rights activist @entity2 cancelled his planned feb. 26 performance on " @entity27 " at the last minute in protest of the " @entity5 " stars appearing the same episode			1
@entity2 called the show 's stars — who own a family business that makes products for hunters — " animal serial killers			2
" @entity37 later hit back during his show 's tuesday monologue : " while i respect his stance on this , i really do , there 's a very good reason why i did n't dump the ' @entity5 ' guys for @entity2			1
and that 's because they have guns			2
" @entity37 also added of the famously downbeat singer , " he keeps finding new ways to depress us			0
" the host aired a parody video for " a new " @entity5 " product for vegans			2
" @entity56 called out on @entity58 joke the pop singer then countered that @entity37 " found time to jokingly promote gun - ownership — hugely amusing for the parents at @entity62 , no doubt			0
he also promoted his special guests " @entity5 " -- who kill beings for fun			2
none of the above issues are , of course , as important as @entity37 himself , who has finally revealed his show to have an overwhelming loss of meaning			0
tune in and relive the intellectual fog of the 1950s			0
" @entity37 followed that up by tweeting yestrerday , " note to @entity2 — if you have more dumb statements to make , i invite you to make them where i do , on my show			0
" he included in the tweet a link to the cover art for @entity2 's 2004 album @entity84 , which featured the singer wielding a machine gun			0
the @entity88 - friendly @entity4 docu - series has been on a ratings tear since catching fire last year			1
