-- @entity2 striker @entity1 has apologised for apparent homophobic comments he made in a @entity5 press conference			1
the outspoken striker 's comments came after he was asked about an @entity10 tv personality 's claim that there are two gay players in the current @entity2 squad			1
@entity1 is reported to have responded : " if they 're queer , that 's their problem			2
i hope there are n't any queers in the national team			1
" the @entity21 striker 's comments were largely laughed off at the time , but sparked outrage among gay rights groups			1
those reactions prompted an apology on tuesday , with @entity1 issuing a statement which read : " i 'm sincerely sorry that what i said has sparked controversy and protests from gay associations			1
" homophobia is not a sentiment i feel			1
i did n't want to offend anyone and i certainly did n't want to call into question anyone 's freedom of sexuality			2
" i only said it was n't my problem and i would n't allow myself to judge others			0
" campaign group the @entity44 in @entity45 had hit out at @entity1 's original comments , using an @entity10 slang phrase for doing something stupid that plays on @entity1 's name			2
" @entity1 says ' cassanate ' ( stupid things ) about gays , showing his arrogance and irresponsibility , " said spokesman @entity50 in a statement			2
" unifying sport and homophobia gives a dangerous message , especially to the young , " he added			0
despite gay sportsmen making public their sexuality in other sports , there are no high - profile gay footballers in @entity66 's major leagues			0
gay rights groups have called for someone to step forward and make known their sexuality and last year @entity70 goalkeeper @entity69 told @entity73 magazine : " those players who are homosexual should say so			1
that would take a load off their minds			0
" former @entity80 forward @entity79 is the only @entity81 footballer to have come out , later in his career			0
he killed himself in 1998 , aged 37 , after being questioned by police in the @entity84 about an alleged sexual assault on a 17 - year - old boy			0
another @entity88 athlete , former @entity89 star @entity87 , came out but only after he had ended his basketball career			0
former @entity92 international @entity91 came out at the end of his career but said he had not done so earlier as he did not want to be known for his sexuality rather than his sporting prowess .			0
