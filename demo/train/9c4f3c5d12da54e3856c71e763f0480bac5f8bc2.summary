" @entity0 , what we do in life echoes in eternity " gladiators , ready ? from the ancient ruins of @entity11 , a new empire rises			2
but with a nod to the past , the city 's newest gladiator @entity13 's eyes light up when his thoughts turn to historic sites like the @entity19			1
for if all roads lead to @entity11 , the @entity22 president is leaving no stone unturned in his intention to marry the @entity11 's historic past with @entity28 football 's new emerging force			1
" i have one big goal , " @entity13 tells @entity29 , with an infectious smile			2
" i want to get the city to let us play somebody like @entity35 or @entity36 or someone like that at the @entity19			1
" while the idea might have the marketing department rubbing their hands with glee , @entity13 could have his work cut out , persuading those maintaining these sites to allow @entity47 and @entity48 to put on an altogether different kind of gladiatorial show			2
commissioned by @entity51 , the @entity19 remains @entity11 's most iconic monument and while others may not have ever considered bring the modern day roman legion to entertain the masses , @entity13 is not like any other owner			1
" we 'll do a pay - per - view on it , $ 25 around the world , " adds the @entity58 , elaborating on the idea			0
" we could get 300 million people wanting to watch that around the world -- a game in the @entity19 which they 'll never see again			2
" we take that money , which could be billions of dollars , and then set up a foundation in @entity11 to fix up the antiquities even faster and put the rest towards inner city programs in @entity11			2
" @entity51 died before he could see the @entity19 completed by his son , @entity72 , in ad 80 , with the 55,000 arena becoming an integral part of @entity11 's history			1
@entity13 jokes he would n't mind seeing a few lions let out of the traps to speed up the match tempo , and the 56 - year - old @entity80 - born investor , who took over the job of rebuilding @entity22 in 2012 , is clearly a man in a hurry			1
while millions flock to the @entity28 capital to gaze upon the likes of @entity88 , the @entity89 and the @entity90 , @entity13 wants future visitors to embrace a new modern @entity22			1
" when you walk around the city , you can not keep your head down , " he said			0
" you have to look up because of the architecture and every step you take is amazing			0
" for us not to have @entity11 be a significant part of what we are doing with the team would be foolish			2
" a fixture between @entity22 against world class opposition at the @entity19 or perhaps more realistically , at the @entity104 given rock concerts have been staged there , is just one of @entity13 's many ideas			1
neither @entity35 nor @entity36 responded to @entity29 's request to see if they would consider playing against @entity22 in one of these venues in a friendly			1
however , more tangible is @entity13 's intention to provide @entity11 with a new stadium which the club hopes will be ready for the 2016 - 17 season			1
able to accommodate up to 60,000 people , the arena is intended to become the focal point for a new chapter in the club 's history			0
a " @entity129 " will be built adjacent to the stadium providing facilities for the club 's first and youth teams to train , while a deal has been struck with local authorities to extend the metro line allowing easier access for supporters			2
a new club village , which will host restaurants , bars and shops will also be built with the 13,500 square meter fanzone helping to create thousands of jobs			0
given that @entity11 was not built in a day , @entity13 has big plans for @entity22 's youth academy and the city 's youngsters			1
" in the past year , we had @entity22 kids on our shirts which is the foundation we set up for inner city programs in @entity11 , " explained the @entity80			1
" in terms of the youth side of things , we 've got good programs but what we 've instituted is a new educational framework			0
" i did n't think we were doing enough			0
we know only three or four kids are going to make it to @entity152 or the @entity154 , so what are they going to do when they 're 18 or 19 ? " are they going to be a clerk somewhere ? or get a menial job with no education ? " so we instituted a 9th - 12th grade formal program which is online and this will help them get into college			0
" they 'll get accredited if they ca n't make it in football and we 'll help them			0
" a fan of @entity171 franchise @entity170 , @entity13 is well aware of the role that history can have in promoting a brand and he has used some of the @entity171 's ideas to help reinvigorate @entity22			1
a @entity177 was set up following a vote by supporters , while the club 's logo was changed and the name ' as @entity22 ' registered as a trademark			1
he is hoping that the likes of inspirational captain @entity47 , known as ' @entity185 , ' will remain at the club when he retires in an ambassadorial role			0
@entity13 talks about how each of the players is like a son to him , while he insists that those who work in the kitchens or security department equally command his respect			0
" @entity47 is going to be with us forever , " says @entity13 with that trademark smile as he talks about the 38 - year - old player , who made his debut for @entity22 at the age of 16			1
" part of the role will be defined by him on what he wants to do			0
" we would like him to be around the pitch , talking to people who are coming into the club and telling them , ' i 've been here 20 years , this is what @entity22 's all about			1
' " you would love to have him with the youth team and once in a while actually going out there and having a drill with them			0
" and the other thing you 'd love is for him to be an ambassador for us			0
if i 'm a nine - year - old and @entity47 walks in and sits down with you and your parents and says ' i was here and this is what is going on at @entity22 ' then the kids will be thinking ' ok , wow			2
' " while the past and future are being taken care of , the present is very much up to those on the field of play			0
@entity22 , which faces @entity36 in the @entity230 tuesday , has made an encouraging start to the domestic and @entity233 season			1
under head coach @entity235 , the team has impressed with the likes of @entity47 , @entity237 , and @entity238 all catching the eye			0
all three men played a vital role in @entity22 's 3 - 0 win over @entity243 last weekend -- a result which leaves the team in second place and just one point behind leaders @entity249			1
@entity36 represents the biggest test faced by @entity22 at the @entity251 so far this season but for @entity13 , it is these kind of challenges which has put his club back in the big time			1
" people are starting to talk more about what is going on at @entity22 , " @entity13 says with a smile			2
" it 's a long - term thing			0
you can do it in one or two years and people will think it 's a fluke , but the objective is to do it over 20 years and have that stability			0
" we want to be in the @entity230 , compete for the title which i feel we can do this year			0
" @entity36 -- the gladiator awaits .			0
