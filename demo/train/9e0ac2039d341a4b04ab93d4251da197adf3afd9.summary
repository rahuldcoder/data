-- when @entity2 was growing up , it seemed very unlikely he would one day assume the mantle of " the greatest athlete in the world			1
" the reigning @entity7 decathlon champion spent his troubled teenage years in @entity8 " getting into fights " and it was only the intervention of his mother which set him on the path to eventual golden glory			1
if he earns a place in the @entity18 team for @entity19 , the 32 - year - old will hope to become the first man to win medals in the grueling 10 - event discipline at three successive @entity7 , having claimed silver in @entity24 in 2004			1
assuming he comes through the trials , which start on friday , @entity2 will be one of the favorites for gold in the @entity29 capital in august			1
his @entity31 triumph followed in the footsteps of other @entity34 decathlon greats , the first being the legendary @entity35 , who won gold at @entity37 in 1912			1
@entity35 was presented with his medal by @entity39 , who announced he was the " greatest athlete in the world " -- a tag which has stuck for all subsequent winners of track and field 's toughest test , which is competed over two days			2
more recently , @entity48 's 1976 triumph in @entity49 gained him massive exposure in the @entity18 while @entity51 took the title on home soil in 1996 in @entity54 to great acclaim			0
@entity56 once famously said : " the decathlon is a big , high brick wall which nobody is able to climb			2
nobody ever beats the decathlon			2
" he cashed in on his success , building up a business fortune , and has most recently has been seen in the reality tv series " keeping up with the @entity65 " -- he is the stepfather of the four children			0
by contrast , devout @entity67 leads a quiet family life , largely away from the media spotlight , dedicating himself to training at the university in @entity73 where he also spent his college years			1
" i have my faith that 's first , my family that 's second and my track comes third , " he told @entity0 's human to @entity76			2
troubled early years it was not always so			2
" i was n't a good kid growing up			0
i was getting into fights			0
i was a very misguided youth , " @entity2 said			1
born in @entity83 to a @entity85 mother and an @entity34 father , he spent much of his childhood and teenage years in @entity8			1
his parents later divorced but his mother remained a strong influence on his life , steering him away from team sports where his early lack of discipline would have seen him rebel against authority			2
" my mum gave me the option of doing track and field or swimming			0
i chose track , " he recounted			0
@entity2 's recent book " redemption " puts the spotlight on his early years and is subtitled : " a @entity106 , a @entity107 , and the @entity108 to @entity109			1
" it tells of the fights , dabbling in drugs and moments of desperate , pre-suicidal depression , but he came through it with sport and faith his salvation			0
having been put on the correct path , @entity2 earned a place at @entity121 , an @entity122 college near @entity123			1
it was there his all - round talents were spotted by his current coach @entity127 , who directed him towards the decathlon			1
" if i 'm being honest , when i was growing up i said i wanted to go to the @entity7 , " @entity2 said			1
" i remember i signed my yearbook with the @entity7 rings and wrote ' 2004			1
' " i think deep down inside i knew it was a dream , a pretty far - fetched dream , i did n't know if it was actually going to happen			2
" brutal training regime @entity2 's early ambitions have clearly been met , but not without an incredible amount of hard work and dedication			2
six days per week , he practices at @entity137 for up to seven hours each day			0
he rises at 6 a.m. and is in the weights room an hour later before heading to the track to work on the various disciplines -- a mixture of running , jumping and throwing -- which make up his event			0
with such an immense training load he is constantly striving to find enough time to maintain his calorie intake			0
" it 's just making sure we get enough of everything we need -- enough protein , enough carbohydrates , enough calories			0
it really comes down to eating as much as you can , and eating when you can			0
" @entity2 likes to train early so he can spend the afternoon on outside commitments and in the evening be with his family -- wife @entity157 and their three children			1
@entity7 goals having married in 2004 , @entity157 has seen @entity2 reach the heights in his chosen sport , starting with silver medal in @entity24 behind world record - holder @entity164 of the @entity165			1
the tables were turned at the 2005 world championships in @entity168 , @entity169 as @entity2 relegated @entity164 to the silver			1
injuries meant @entity2 was unable to defend his world crown in @entity173 in 2007 , but the following year he dominated the @entity7 in @entity31 , winning by more than 200 points			1
@entity2 admitted to @entity0 that he has to be careful not to push himself too hard in training -- " i have to be really disciplined " -- because further hamstring and knee injures denied him the chance to compete at either the 2009 or 2011 world championships			1
but in 2010 he won the world indoor heptathlon title in @entity181 and the decathlon at the prestigious @entity183 in @entity184 , showing he can still cut it at the highest level			1
for @entity2 , the @entity7 are the pinnacle of his sport and inspire him to even greater feats			1
" the entire world stops , no matter what 's going on , " he said			0
" @entity192 is that we get together and celebrate in the @entity7 spirit , and to me that 's inspiring			2
it 's about inspiring our youth , inspiring the people of the world to be better , to be the best they can be			0
" this is the one time the entire world gets together to do that			0
" but he knows that he can not afford to make any big mistakes over the two days of competition			0
" we 're trying to be consistent because consistency is what makes a good score , " @entity2 said			2
" it comes down to the person who makes the least amount of mistakes , and that 's something that has to do with the mental side of things			0
" sporting philosophy @entity216 's gentle demeanor is a ferocious competitive spirit which has stood him in good stead at previous @entity7			2
" the decathlon is such an amazing test of your mental strength and how far you can push yourself and your physical strength and endurance , " he said			0
" i love putting myself to the test like that			0
i enjoy it , i feed off that trying to figure out how far i can go			0
" i also like competition			0
i 'm a competitive person by nature and i enjoy saying ' i 'm better than you ' at whatever it is we 're doing			0
" @entity2 shares that in common with the great @entity29 decathlete @entity235 , who won successive golds in @entity237 and @entity123 and narrowly missed out on a third medal when fourth in @entity239 in 1988			1
@entity2 will look to match @entity235 's double gold heroics in @entity241 , and is relishing besting an athlete he much admires by getting on the podium for the third straight time			1
" i can go up to him and say i 've got one up on him , " he said .			0
