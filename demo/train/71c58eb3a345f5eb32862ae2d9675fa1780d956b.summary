the @entity1 will no longer pursue mandatory minimum sentences for certain low - level , nonviolent drug offenders , attorney general @entity0 said monday , noting the nation is " coldly efficient in jailing criminals , " but that it " can not prosecute or incarcerate " its way to becoming safer			1
" too many @entity8 go to too many prisons for far too long , and for no truly good law enforcement reason , " @entity0 told the @entity11 's @entity10 in @entity12			1
he questioned some assumptions about the criminal justice system 's approach to the " war on drugs , " saying that excessive incarceration has been an " ineffective and unsustainable " part of it			0
although he said the @entity8 should not abandon being tough on crime , @entity0 embraced steps to address " shameful " racial disparities in sentencing , the budgetary strains of overpopulated prisons and policies for incarceration that punish and rehabilitate , " not merely to warehouse and forget			1
" @entity0 invoked president @entity31 , saying the two had been talking about the issues and agreed to try to " strike a balance " that clears the way for a " pragmatic " and " commonsense " solutions to enhance public safety and the " public good			1
" the centerpiece of @entity0 's plan is to scale back prosecution for certain drug offenders -- those with no ties to large - scale organizations , gangs or cartels			1
he said they would no longer be charged with offenses that " impose draconian mandatory minimum sentences			0
" they now " will be charged with offenses for which the accompanying sentences are better suited to their individual conduct , rather than excessive prison terms more appropriate for violent criminals or drug kingpins			0
" the changes are effective immediately			0
lessening the use of mandatory minimums -- sentences that require a " one - size - fits - all " punishment for those convicted of federal and state crimes -- could mark the end of the tough - on - crime era that began with strict anti-drug laws in the 1970s and accelerated with mandatory minimum prison sentences and so - called three - strikes laws			0
opinion : shame of mandatory minimums shows in @entity75 case the attorney general linked the effort to rethink mandatory minimum sentencing for drug crimes to key issues			1
racial disparities @entity0 said " unwarranted disparities are far too common " in the criminal justice system , reminding his audience that @entity31 alluded to some of the issues in remarks he made after the acquittal of @entity89 in the death of @entity91 last month , giving voice to @entity94 concerns that " there is a history of racial disparities in the application of our criminal laws -- everything from the death penalty to enforcement of our drug laws			1
" @entity0 said the nation " must confront the reality " that once " people of color " are in the criminal justice system , they " often face harsher punishments than their peers			2
" he called it " unacceptable , " " shameful " and " unworthy " of the @entity8 legal tradition			2
prison overcrowding @entity0 said the @entity8 prison population has grown by almost 800 % since 1980 , and federal prisons are operating at nearly 40 % above capacity			1
" even though this country comprises just 5 % of the world 's population , we incarcerate almost a quarter of the world 's prisoners			0
more than 219,000 federal inmates are currently behind bars , " he said , noting that almost half are serving time for drug - related crimes and have substance abuse problems			2
moreover , he said 9 million to 10 million more people cycle through @entity8 's local jails each year			2
and roughly 40 % of former federal prisoners -- and more than 60 % of former state prisoners -- are rearrested or have their supervision revoked within three years after their release			0
it was not immediately clear monday whether @entity0 's announcement would have any impact on people already in prison			2
economic , social burden @entity0 said overcrowding at the federal , state and local levels is " both ineffective and unsustainable			2
" he said it imposes a significant economic burden -- totaling $ 80 billion in 2010 alone -- and it comes with " human and moral costs that are impossible to calculate			0
" legislation to lessen the use of mandatory minimums , @entity0 said , would ultimately save the @entity8 billions			1
@entity0 going after @entity154 voting law although @entity31 administration officials say the changes they are pursuing will not require congressional approval , some unlikely pairs of lawmakers have united to push for criminal justice changes			2
@entity162 sen. @entity161 of @entity163 and @entity164 sen. @entity164 of @entity165 have worked together to allow judges to depart from mandatory minimum sentences when circumstances merit			1
@entity162 sen. @entity169 of @entity170 and @entity164 sen. @entity164 of @entity171 have undertaken similar efforts			1
@entity0 blasts ' stand your ground ' in recent years , there has been a rise in support among conservatives for reforms to the criminal justice system			1
while more flexible approaches to crimes have long held support among @entity187 , the fear of being tarred as weak on crime by @entity164 opponents has long caused moderate @entity187 , particularly those running for president , to avoid the issue			1
in addition to changes to mandatory minimums , @entity0 called for expanding the use of " compassionate release " from jail for those who " pose no threat to the public			0
" he also said the @entity1 is taking steps to identify practices for enhancing the use of drug treatment and community service programs as alternatives to jail			0
@entity0 also said he has asked federal prosecutors to develop new guidelines for determining when federal charges should be filed and when they should not			0
" i 've also issued guidance to ensure that every case we bring serves a substantial federal interest and complements the work of our law enforcement partners , " he said			0
@entity0 additionally directed prosecutors to create comprehensive anti-violence strategies for badly afflicted areas			0
@entity0 not afraid to take on race debate the @entity219 praised @entity0 's approach monday , calling it an important step toward ending federal prison overcrowding and creating a " fairer criminal justice system			0
" @entity224 , director of the @entity219 's @entity226 legislative office , said in a news release , however , that although @entity0 's announcement " is an important first step , " @entity228 also must act to change laws that " lock up hundreds of thousands of @entity8 unfairly and unnecessarily			1
" @entity232 , a former judge and an attorney general under president @entity234 , said he is not a fan of mandatory minimums , but he does not support what @entity0 is doing			1
" i generally agree with the goal of getting rid of mandatory minimums , " said @entity232			0
" but the way to do that is to pass a law , " he said in an interview on @entity245 's " the lead with @entity244			0

the effort has *diverse* support , *including* @entity164 sen. @entity164 , @entity162 sen. @entity161
