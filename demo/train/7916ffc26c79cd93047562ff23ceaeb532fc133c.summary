-- @entity1 and world powers are resuming talks in @entity4 amid high hopes that a diplomatic solution to @entity1 's nuclear program will finally be reached			1
but while the @entity9 -- the @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 -- and @entity1 appear to be closer than ever to striking a deal , there are still a lot of details to iron out			1
read our explainer to get up to speed on 60 years ' worth of nuclear history in @entity1			2
when did @entity1 's nuclear program begin ? the @entity10 launched a nuclear cooperation program with @entity1 in 1957 -- back when the @entity23 ruled @entity1 and the two countries were still friends -- and by the mid- 70s @entity1 began developing its nuclear power program			1
but the @entity10 pulled its support when the @entity23 was overthrown during the @entity28 in 1979			0
why is the @entity29 worried about @entity1 's nuclear program ? since the 1979 revolution the @entity29 has worried that @entity1 could use its nuclear program to produce atomic weapons by producing highly - enriched uranium -- the material needed to make a bomb			1
@entity1 has always insisted it only wants to use nuclear power for peaceful purposes			2
in 2003 nuclear inspectors from the @entity39 announced they had found traces of highly - enriched uranium at a plant in @entity43			0
@entity1 temporarily halted enrichment but resumed enriching again in 2006 , insisting enrichment was allowed under its agreement with the @entity39			2
what did the international community do ? in late 2006 the @entity49 passed sanctions against @entity1 for failing to suspend its nuclear program			1
sanctions that initially targeted @entity1 's nuclear capability were greatly expanded over the next seven years to include bans on arms sales to @entity1 , travel bans on certain @entity1 , @entity57 bans on buying @entity1 oil , and bans on dealing with @entity1 financial institutions , including the country 's central bank			1
have sanctions worked ? no and yes			0
in 2007 @entity1 claimed to have 3,000 centrifuges capable of enriching uranium			1
today @entity1 has 19,000 centrifuges and is building more advanced ones , according to @entity68 , a nuclear policy expert at the @entity70			2
on the other hand , sanctions have crippled the country 's economy			1
oil revenues have plummeted , and the local currency had dropped 80 % in value by 2012			0
the @entity1 people have faced spiralling inflation and job layoffs within the state sector , according to @entity0 's @entity82			2
why are @entity1 and world powers talking now ? the @entity10 believes these sanctions have left @entity1 little choice but to compromise its nuclear ambitions in return for relief from the economy - destroying effects of the oil and banking bans			1
newly - elected @entity1 president @entity93 is also more moderate than his predecessor , and all sides believe there could now be a window of time to get a deal done			2
how close is @entity1 to producing a nuclear bomb ? one @entity10 - based anti-proliferation group says @entity1 could potentially produce enough weapons - grade uranium for a nuclear bomb in as little as a month if it broke with international laws and went all - out towards production			1
but @entity68 says most world powers believe @entity1 is realistically at least a year away			0
" most of the people involved in this negotiation are looking at a longer time frame of between 1 and 3 years , " he said			1
" negotiators have to be concerned about this but they know it 's a worst - case scenario			0
" what would a deal on @entity1 's nuclear program look like ? most importantly , @entity1 would have to agree to suspend enriching uranium to 20 % purity , according to one scenario being considered			1
while uranium is n't bomb - grade until it 's enriched to 90 % purity , @entity68 says " once you 're at 20 % , you 're about 80 % of the way there			0
" @entity1 would also have to reduce its uranium stockpiles , stop constructing new centrifuges , and freeze essential work on its heavy - water reactor under development at @entity129 , which could be used as a source of plutonium -- a second pathway to a nuclear bomb			1
in return , world powers would have to agree to relax sanctions and allow @entity1 to enrich some uranium at a low level			2
@entity1 also wants the world to acknowledge its right to enrich uranium under the @entity142 ( @entity142 )			0
does @entity1 have the right to enrich uranium ? the @entity10 and other world powers say no , but @entity1 says yes			1
@entity1 believes that it has the right to enrich uranium as a signatory to the @entity142 , but @entity68 says no such right is enshrined in the treaty			0
" there is a right to the peaceful use of nuclear activities in the @entity142 , " he says , " but there 's not a right to enrich uranium specifically			0
" while not conceding the point in principle , @entity1 appeared to loosen its stance on the issue at the weekend when foreign minister @entity162 reportedly told the @entity164 news agency that @entity1 's right to enrich " does not need recognition , because it is an inseparable right based on the @entity142			1
" why have n't other countries faced similar sanctions for their nuclear programs ? @entity171 tested its first nuclear device in 1974 , followed by @entity173 in 1998			0
@entity174 has always refused to confirm or deny that is has the bomb , although the @entity177 estimates it has around 80 atomic weapons			0
action was never taken against @entity171 and @entity173 , partly because they never signed up to the @entity142 -- and in the latter 's case , @entity68 says , " because there was very little that the @entity10 could 've done to stop @entity173			0
" @entity1 , on the other hand , signed up to the npt and its declared program is being inspected by the @entity39			0
and @entity68 says the @entity39 and world powers " have information suggesting that @entity1 has carried out activities it has n't declared in the past			0
" who 's against a deal ? @entity174 is opposed to @entity1 having any nuclear enrichment capabilities at all and says the current plan is " a bad deal " that wo n't work			1
" @entity1 is practically giving away nothing			0
it 's making a minor concession , which they can reverse in weeks , " @entity174 prime minister @entity196 told @entity0			0
" i think if you want a peaceful solution , as i do , then the right thing to do is ratchet up the sanctions			0
" @entity0 's @entity203 says @entity205 's objections to @entity1 are existential			1
" the @entity205 regard @entity206 as a heretical , @entity209 , @entity208 enemy that must be opposed , " he says			0
" its antipathy predates @entity1 's nuclear program and will persist whatever the resolution of it			1
" @entity68 says that as a country with nuclear power ambitions itself , @entity205 is deeply hostile to @entity1 having a nuclear program that includes sensitive activities like uranium enrichment			1
@entity219 leaders in the @entity220 have also said they will try to pass new @entity1 sanctions , despite secretary of state @entity223 's warning that the move could " destroy the ability to get an agreement " in @entity4			2
and even if a deal is agreed , the @entity227 faces an uphill battle trying to convince those same @entity220 leaders to pass laws to relax sanctions on @entity1			2
another tough sell will be @entity1 's hardliners			2
@entity203 says : " supreme leader ayatollah @entity234 and the @entity235 remain deeply anti-american , and they may well oppose the concessions that @entity93 and @entity162 would have to make to get a deal			0
" @entity240 's task is two-fold , says @entity203 : " first he has to get a deal that hardliners in @entity206 can deal with			0
then he has to get one that the hard - liners in @entity243 and @entity244 and @entity245 can abide			0
" how would a deal be enforced ? @entity1 could end up with a program that allows some uranium enrichment in exchange for full cooperation with @entity39 inspectors over the next few years , according to @entity68			1
@entity68 says : " what 's missing is answers from @entity1 to pressing questions from the @entity39 about the scope and extent of the @entity1 nuclear program during its history			1
if the powers are going to relax sanctions , they and the @entity39 need to know that the program in @entity1 is exclusively dedicated to peaceful use			2
if they can get answers to those questions , that will bring @entity1 pretty far along			0

@entity1 's nuclear program actually began with cooperation from the @entity10 in the 1950s
sanctions since 2007 hit ordinary @entity1 hard but failed to halt country 's nuclear program
most countries involved in talks believe @entity1 is between 1 and 3 years away from bomb
@entity174 and @entity205 will reject any deal that allows @entity1 to keep enriching uranium
