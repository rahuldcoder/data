to catch the predawn announcement of the @entity8 nominations , then we 're in the same twisted little club			1
years before @entity8 handicapping became an official @entity13 sport -- what ? it 's not ? -- two fellow @entity8 - obsessed friends and i made an annual game of trying to predict who 'd get nominated			1
i never won ( i tied once ) , but i never lost my enthusiasm for it ; that is until every magazine and website came along with their own predictions and took the fun out of it			2
this year for old times ' sake we revived our game , only doing the best actor category because it 's been an impossibly full year of great male lead performances that have stumped the prognosticators			1
my 14 - year - old nephew @entity35 was in on it because he 's been a rabid @entity8 fiend since he was at least , oh , 12			1
call out a category -- best actress say -- and a year -- 1966 -- and he 'll holler back " @entity40			2
" am i proud , or concerned ? today the results came in and we all tied with four corrects each , but with different names on our lists			0
@entity47 must have known @entity48 had the gale winds of " @entity50 " at his back			0
@entity58 , a great strategist , and @entity35 the @entity57 devotee , both recognized @entity53 's high standing with the @entity54 , even if @entity35 wo n't be seeing that film anytime soon , i pray			1
we all had faith in @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 ( funny how we know them all by first name			0
) i held out for @entity66 because , well , he 's @entity66 , and because i 'm un-young			2
that should teach me to stop leading with my heart			0
but did anyone ever imagine that betting against mr. @entity8 himself , @entity71 , could pay off ? if i had i would have won for once			1
of course , @entity8 mania is not just about the horse race			1
it 's also the spectacle , the show around the show			1
i have n't missed an @entity8 since i got hooked as a teen			1
my favorite year was 1978 , the night @entity79 and @entity80 took the best leads categories for " @entity82			0
" justice ! glory ! as a professional plower of the fields of celebrity , with a license to fawn and gush ( want to see my card ? ) i 've attended the @entity8 , been inside the crimson cocoon , felt the collective shock when " @entity93 " beat " @entity94 " for @entity92			1
i 've stepped on a few gowns			0
not even the cruel realization that there are essentially two red carpets -- velvet stanchions separate the stars on one side from the rest of us attendees -- could squelch my blind and blinded - by - the - flashbulbs enthusiasm			0
but like most true believers i have my moments of doubt			0
if you are not in our little club , i get where you 're coming from			2
to the @entity115 it is all too much , too little , and certainly , should you try to slog through the entire three - and - a - half hour ceremony on march 2 , too late			0
it is kind of preposterous : over-hyped , over-scored , overwrought			0
in poor @entity8 's defense , for the past decade or so @entity118 's big night has had to suffer indignities that the @entity54 could n't have imagined : dwindling viewership , the cultural - relevance supremacy of tv over movies , an attention deficit that just ca n't sit still for the live - action shorts category , acting and directing victories basically pre-called by critics and @entity129 and bookies , @entity131			1
there 's desperation in the air			2
@entity8 's been trying too hard			1
this year 's host @entity135 will take care of some of that , i 'm sure			2
you never see her sweat			0
plus , there 's red carpet fatigue , as the @entity8 limp on high heels to the finish line of a bloated awards season as overextended as @entity146 and the @entity147			1
critics ' awards , the @entity149 , the @entity150 , the @entity151 â € ” you can only cut to a reaction shot of @entity155 so many times before it constitutes stalking			0
but is it @entity8 's fault that everyone else wants in on the action ? i recognize the madness -- struggle with it -- but it 's hopeless			1
i just ca n't shake my addiction			2
will i sound like i 'm on the @entity54 's payroll if i argue that the @entity8 really are a great national tradition ? movies , of course , which might actually be getting better			1
and stars , our collective guilty delight			0
and glamor , maybe even a modicum of sophistication			0
and there are less - lofty traditions to savor : carping about his speech , dissing her dress			0
trying to catch a loser register a little disappointment			0
enduring campy production numbers with aerialists			0
dutifully filling out the ballots at your friend 's @entity8 party even if the only movie you saw that year starred @entity190			1
it 's all part of the ritual			2
the knowing that it 's all too much , but the kind of too much that some of us just ca n't get enough of			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			0

if you watched early morning @entity8 nominations , you 're in @entity203
@entity205 : it 's not just a horse race : @entity8 mania is the spectacle , the show , the history
@entity205 : @entity54 could n't have imagined dwindling viewership , *competition* from tv
despite its *excesses* , he says , @entity8 are a great national tradition , with a little magic
