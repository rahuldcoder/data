-- remember when we all waved at @entity2 last month while the @entity3 took our picture ? well , @entity5 has finally gotten the film back from the drugstore -- and you can see our whole world			1
a good chunk of it , anyway			0
people shared more than 1,400 images of themselves as part of the july 19 " wave at @entity2 " event , which was organized by @entity5 's @entity18 mission			1
on tuesday , the space agency released a collage of those images , which -- from a distance -- looks like the portion of the @entity25 's @entity24 that @entity3 viewed at the time			2
zoom in , however , and you can see everyday folks expressing their oneness with the ringed sixth planet from the sun. ( the full - resolution version is here			0
) " @entity18 , " says a chalked message in one photo			0
" thanks for helping @entity25 wave at me today			2
@entity40 , @entity2 , " read a handheld sign in another			0
@entity5 was thankful , too			0
" thanks to all of you , near and far , old and young , who joined the @entity3 mission in marking the first time inhabitants of @entity25 had advance notice that our picture was being taken from interplanetary distances , " said @entity3 project scientist @entity41 in a statement released by @entity5 's @entity43			1
" while @entity25 is too small in the images @entity3 obtained to distinguish any individual human beings , the mission has put together this collage so that we can celebrate all your waving hands , uplifted paws , smiling faces and artwork			1
" the images came from 30 states and 40 countries			1
people used a variety of technologies to transmit them , including @entity68 , @entity69 and e-mail			0
@entity3 took a picture of @entity25 as part of a larger set of images it was collecting of the @entity2 system			1
scientists are busy putting together the color mosaic of the @entity2 system , which they expect will take at least several more weeks to complete			2
the scientists who study @entity2 's rings are poring over visible - light and infrared data obtained during that campaign			2
the project originated because the @entity3 , which was launched in 1997 and has been in orbit around @entity2 since 2004 , was going to be taking pictures of the planet and its rings during a solar eclipse			1
thanks to various cosmological arrangements , the @entity25 was minutely visible in the endless universe beyond			0
the picture of @entity25 , though it does n't reveal much scientifically , was a rare opportunity , @entity5 noted in july			1
" since the @entity96 began , there have been only two images of @entity25 from the outer solar system , " the agency said			2
and now , there are more -- and one that features so many of us			0
hope you did n't blink .			0
