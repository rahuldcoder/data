@entity0 , @entity1 -- embattled @entity1 leader @entity3 flatly denied monday the existence of the protests threatening to end his 41 - year rule , as reports of fighting between government forces and rebels raged another day			1
in a joint interview with @entity13 ' @entity11 and the @entity14 , @entity3 also denied using force against his people , @entity11 reported			1
excerpts of the interview were posted on the networks ' websites			0
" no demonstration at all in the streets , " he said , speaking at a restaurant in @entity0			2
told by the @entity14 's @entity25 that he had seen demonstrators in the streets that morning , @entity3 asked , " are they supporting us ? " " they love me , all my people with me , they love me all			1
they will die to protect me , my people , " he said			0
government forces have repeatedly clashed with demonstrators over the past two weeks in @entity1 , fired on crowds and at times shot indiscriminately at people in the streets , numerous witnesses have told @entity2			1
the death toll has topped 1,000 , according to an estimate from @entity42 @entity41 ban ki - moon			2
soon after @entity3 's interview , @entity44 ambassador to the @entity42 @entity45 said the @entity1 strongman sounded " delusional			1
" " and when he can laugh in talking to @entity44 and international journalists while he is slaughtering his own people , it only underscores how unfit he is to lead and how disconnected he is from reality , " she said			1
@entity3 's regime has lost control of parts of the country to rebel forces , and with each passing day more @entity1 officials around the world have defected , joining calls for his ouster			1
the use of the term " rebel " to describe the anti-government forces is apt , said @entity65 , former @entity44 ambassador to @entity66 and now a senior fellow at @entity68 of @entity69			1
" in @entity72 , you did n't have a force that was developed ; you had protesters who were demonstrating against the government and the government relented , " he told @entity2 in a telephone interview			1
" here , you actually have a government that retains force at its disposal and you have demonstrators joined by elements of the military that have forces at their disposal			0
so it really has become an armed rebellion			0
" even as @entity3 sought to project confidence monday , reports came in that a military jet bombed a military base in an area controlled by rebel forces			2
the base is near @entity94 , 90 miles south of @entity95 , a stronghold of government opponents			0
some bases in the area have fallen into the hands of protesters as more members of the military have abandoned @entity3 's regime and joined demonstrations			1
several soldiers told @entity2 they switched their allegiance after refusing to use weapons against peaceful demonstrators			0
@entity2 saw the military jet fly overhead and heard the sounds of explosions			0
witnesses reported a bombing at the base			0
but @entity1 state television later denied any such bombing had occurred			2
the @entity117 said reports that the @entity1 air force conducted strikes on the ammunition depots in the cities of @entity94 and @entity123 were false , state tv reported			1
while @entity2 has staff in some cities , the network can not independently confirm reports for many areas in @entity1			2
@entity2 has gathered information through telephone interviews with witnesses			0
@entity134 forces also tried to attack a radio station in @entity136 , a city controlled by protesters , a witness said			0
a military chopper with soldiers on board has tried to land a couple of times over the past three days , but the opposition fired at the soldiers and kept them away , the witness said			0
the international community , meanwhile , launched new efforts monday to pressure @entity3 to halt the violence			2
" he has lost his legitimacy when he declared war on his people , " secretary - general @entity149 said about embattled @entity1 leader , urging him to heed the call of his people			1
@entity158 spokesman col. @entity157 said the @entity44 is " repositioning " naval and air forces in the region to be prepared for any option that it may need to exercise			2
he would not comment on whether any ground forces are being put on alert or having leaves cancelled because of @entity1			2
@entity44 secretary of state @entity166 said at a meeting in @entity168 , @entity169 , of the @entity170 that the @entity44 is exploring " all possible options , " and that " nothing is off the table so long as the @entity1 government continues to threaten and kill @entity1 citizens			1
" " colonel @entity3 and those around him must be held accountable for these acts , which violate international legal obligations and common decency			2
through their actions , they have lost the legitimacy to govern			0
and the people of @entity1 have made themselves clear : it is time for @entity3 to go , now , without further violence or delay , " she said			1
asked at a news conference whether the @entity44 planned an imminent military response , @entity188 said , " no. " @entity192 press secretary @entity191 said monday that " exile is certainly one option " for @entity3			1
@entity191 also said the @entity44 government is considering the possibility of imposing a no - fly zone over @entity1			1
also monday , the @entity44 became the latest country to announce it had frozen @entity3 - related assets			1
the @entity44 government froze at least $ 30 billion in @entity1 government assets under @entity44 jurisdiction after enacting sanctions on friday , a @entity202 official said			1
it marked the largest amount ever blocked under a sanctions program , according to acting under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence @entity209			0
in @entity0 , protesters stayed off the streets , telling @entity2 they feared violence			1
government officials spread word that thousands of people could die if the popular uprising continues			0
on the 14th day of protests , there appeared to be a stalemate			0
some in @entity0 told @entity2 they feared their protest movement was losing momentum			2
but around the world , support for the protests was growing			0
yet another prominent @entity1 official , the country 's ambassador to @entity227 , added his voice to the calls for @entity3 to end his nearly 42 - year grip on power			1
@entity3 " should take the ultimate decision to step down in the interest of @entity1 , " @entity232 told reporters in @entity234			1
the @entity238 's high representative for foreign affairs , @entity237 , said the @entity170 " has a grave responsibility to ensure that our often - stated intentions are translated into real actions and real progress			0
" speaking at the meeting in @entity168 , @entity245 said , " what matters in the end is not the number of resolutions passed but results in the real world			0
" in an interview with @entity2 , @entity245 said stopping the violence means trying " to persuade the people concerned that they will be held to account , that there will be the @entity258 , that we will stop their assets being moved , that we will hold them to account for their actions			2
that 's what we do as an international community			0
that 's what we have to make clear			0
and there 's no doubt in my mind that actually they do listen to what 's being said			0
" the @entity273 over the weekend voted for tough restrictions and possible war crimes charges against the @entity1 regime			2
the @entity273 measures -- which include an arms embargo , an asset freeze and travel bans for @entity3 and members of his family and associates -- also referred the situation unfolding in @entity1 to the @entity258			1
on sunday , @entity3 criticized the @entity273 resolution , telling private @entity287 station @entity288 by phone that council members " took a decision based on media reports that are based abroad			2
" he added , " if the @entity273 wants to know about something , they should have sent a fact - finding committee			0
" the protests , which began february 15 , have been fueled largely by people demanding freedom and decrying high unemployment			2
as the 68 - year - old @entity3 has appeared increasingly cornered , some @entity1 officials have begun to discuss openly what a post-gadhafi @entity1 government would look like			1
over the weekend , @entity1 's deputy ambassador to the @entity42 , @entity303 , indicated he and fellow diplomats support " in principle " a caretaker administration under the direction of former justice minister @entity307			1
@entity307 quit february 21 to protest the " bloody situation " and " use of excessive force " against unarmed protesters , according to @entity1 newspaper @entity313			1
