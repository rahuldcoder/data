-- babies may be born larger than normal because of a condition called gestational diabetes			1
that explains why baby @entity5 , born in @entity6 last week , weighed more than 13 pounds			2
her mother had gestational diabetes , but her condition was n't discovered until she went into labor and checked herself into @entity11			1
gestational diabetes develops during pregnancy and resembles other forms of diabetes in that it affects how your cells use sugar ( glucose )			1
with gestational diabetes , a mother 's blood sugar should return to normal soon after delivery			1
however , the condition puts women at risk for type 2 diabetes in the future			0
for every 100 pregnant women in the @entity32 , two to 10 will have gestational diabetes , the @entity30 says			1
a woman who has gestational diabetes during pregnancy and maintains a high blood - sugar level may have a baby born abnormally large , weighing 9 pounds or more , the @entity30 says			1
a baby 's large size creates problems for the delivery of the child through the birth canal and may cause nerve damage in the child 's shoulder during birth			1
" a very large baby has an increased chance of being overweight or obese later in life , " the @entity30 says			1
" being overweight or obese increases the chance of also having diabetes later in life			1
" gestational diabetes results from hormonal changes that every woman has during pregnancy , according to the @entity60			1
elevated levels of certain hormones made in the placenta disrupt insulin 's ability to manage glucose , a condition called insulin resistance			0
( the placenta is the organ connecting the baby by the umbilical cord to the uterus and sends nutrients from mother to child			2
) as the placenta becomes larger throughout pregnancy , it creates more hormones , which , in turn , increases the insulin resistance , the @entity60 said			0
the mother 's pancreas is typically able to make three times the normal amount of insulin to beat this resistance , according to the @entity60			0
if the pancreas ca n't produce the required amount of insulin , however , sugar levels will rise , and the woman will have gestational diabetes			1
you may be at risk for gestational diabetes if you are overweight before becoming pregnant , have a family history of diabetes , are older than 25 , have previously giving birth to a baby over 9 pounds , previously gave birth to a stillborn baby , have had gestational diabetes with a previous pregnancy or have been diagnosed with pre-diabetes , the @entity60 said			1
women typically find out whether they have gestational diabetes between the 24th and 28th weeks of pregnancy , according to the @entity60			2
that 's when insulin resistance usually begins			0
if you previously had gestational diabetes or if your doctor is concerned about your risk of developing it , you can be tested for the condition before the 13th week of pregnancy , according to the @entity60			2
an oral glucose tolerance test is used to screen for gestational diabetes			2
this involves consuming 50 grams of glucose in a beverage			0
your body will absorb the glucose and cause your blood sugar levels to rise within 30 to 60 minutes , according to the @entity60			0
blood samples are taken from a vein in your arm 30 minutes after consuming the sweetened drink so that your doctor can evaluate how your body processes glucose			0
according to the @entity129 , expectant mothers can control gestational diabetes by eating healthy foods , exercising and , if required , taking medication			2
treatment may include monitoring blood sugar four to five times a day , which involves drawing a drop of blood from your finger and testing it with a blood glucose meter			0
your health care providers will monitor and manage your blood sugar levels during labor and delivery			0
following up with blood sugar checks after the baby is born is also important			0
you can reduce your risk of developing type 2 diabetes later on by continuing to eat a healthy diet and getting regular exercise			0
