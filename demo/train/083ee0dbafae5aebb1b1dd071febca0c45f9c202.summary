-- @entity1 walked out of a courtroom thursday a free man			1
how long will it take women attracted by the flame of celebrity -- even ill - gotten -- to date him ? and believe they can convert him to monogamy ? the former @entity13 presidential hopeful 's affair with @entity14 and the subsequent cover - up led to six counts carrying a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison and a $ 1.5 million fine			1
federal prosecutors argued that @entity1 knowingly violated campaign finance laws by accepting large contributions from @entity23 and @entity24 to support @entity25 and their child , and keep the affair under wraps			1
@entity29 : juror had no intention of flirting with @entity1 a federal jury in @entity33 acquitted him on one count of violating campaign finance law thursday and deadlocked on the five other counts against him			1
prosecutors may still decide to retry him			1
politicians like @entity1 and @entity40 and celebrities like @entity42 and @entity43 seem to have no trouble attracting new girlfriends after public accusations of cheating			1
opinion : @entity1 jury got it exactly right it 's always possible that people who have cheated in the past will not cheat in the future			1
but relationship experts say past behavior is a better predictor of the future than any cheater 's promises			1
" denial can be really powerful in new relationships , " said divorce recovery expert @entity61 , co-founder of @entity63 in @entity64 , @entity65			1
" people use it as a defense against knowing the truth			2
they do n't look at all the facts , and ultimately , that ends up being a problem			2
" @entity75 works wonders cheaters are usually unsatisfied about something in their lives , experts say , or they would n't stray			2
but it 's not always clear whether they 're truly unhappy with their partners or about something they ca n't fix in themselves			2
rarely does the cheater take responsibility for his ( or her ) life and getting out of it honorably			2
the spouses generally get the blame			2
the reputation of @entity92 , who separated from @entity1 in 2010 after 32 years of marriage and died of cancer in 2010 , seemed to be on trial at times			1
a full participant in her husband 's presidential campaign , she could be tough and blunt with campaign staffers			1
after reports surfaced of the affair , a witness testified , @entity92 confronted her husband and ripped off her blouse to show her mastectomy scars			1
" you do n't see me anymore , " former staffer @entity107 quoted her as saying			2
@entity1 charges : the rundown " i 've worked with countless people like this , and it 's always the same , " writes @entity111 , author of " @entity112 , " a book about rebuilding trust in relationships , in an e-mail			1
" the cheater says , ' my spouse is fat / stupid / mean / boring / whatever ( insert adjective ) and i need someone who is skinny / smart / nice / interesting / opposite - of - whatever			2
you are skinny / smart / nice / interesting / opposite - of - whatever			2
so we can be happy forever			0
' " the cheater 's flattery can be intoxicating , convincing the other person that he or she is special and protected from being cheated on in the future			0
" they think they 're special because they 've been told they 're special , and they want to believe it , " @entity111 said			0
" it 's not that people do n't think			0
it 's that flattery and excitement short - circuit thought			0
" and an @entity144 report that a juror might have been flirting with @entity1 drew a lot of attention			1
@entity1 flirting ? @entity149 surprise			1
can cheaters change ? of course , many cheaters can change if they have the desire			0
much has been made of @entity153 , who had an affair with @entity153 while he was married to his second wife , helping her husband convert to @entity158			1
it 's possible that @entity153 may stay faithful , if for no other reason than the 24 - news cycle means public figures are being constantly scrutinized for evidence of bad behavior			0
why politicians lie and why we want to believe them affairs with married men or women are a high - risk gamble , says @entity171 , an @entity172 psychology professor			0
look at the evidence : cheating is how he or she has chosen to solve relationship problems			0
" when you win such a man , you are winning someone who feels entitled to have his cake and eat it too and then lie about it , " @entity171 said			0
so @entity153 or any future @entity1 girlfriend should n't assume she can change the cheater or that he will be different with her because she 's so special			1
their love , and his belief in @entity188 or occupancy of the @entity190 , will not keep anyone faithful if he does n't want to be or ca n't be faithful			0
( former president @entity192 proved that point			0
) questions to ask it is possible for people in decent marriages to fall in love outside the marriage , but it 's important to carefully assess whether the couple can get beyond the fantasy to the reality of love			0
" i would try to look carefully at the ( cheater 's ) motivation and see what you feel is genuinely true between the two of us , " said @entity205 , author of " the wisdom of a @entity207			0
" " do you admire their character otherwise ? do you feel loved and seen as you are ? " there needs to be some recognition that your relationship is n't a perfect replacement of an imperfect marriage			0
" a question to ask yourself is , ' does my relationship include difficulty ? ' " @entity205 recommended			0
" are there things that bug me about this person ? if there are n't , that would send up a red flag for me			0
" if they seem only motivated by ambition or simply looking for brighter horizons , " delete them from your @entity233 account and move on , " she says .			0
