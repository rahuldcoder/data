@entity0 -- of all the aircraft on display at the @entity5 , the brand new , fuel - efficient @entity2 is dominating attention			1
billed as the new generation wide - bodied jetliner and seen as a direct competitor to @entity12 's @entity11 , the @entity2 has been drawing crowds , taking part in aerial displays and opening its doors to select trade visitors			1
it 's all part of a grand plan by @entity20 's @entity2 to try to woo as many buyers as possible			2
inside the 40,000 square meters of airshow exhibition space , the plane 's maker , @entity2 , has also grabbed the limelight , announcing the first big deal of this biennial aerospace and defense trade show to a packed press conference on tuesday -- the firm sale of 63 @entity32 single aisle aircraft to low cost @entity34 carrier @entity33			1
delivery is scheduled to start later this year			0
@entity33 will also lease a further seven @entity32 aircraft and has purchase options for another 30			2
the $ 6.4 billion deal is a significant expansion for the privately - owned low - cost airline , which was only founded in 2011			1
" the @entity32 has proven to be extremely efficient in service with @entity33 and is a favorite with our passengers , " said @entity33 's managing director @entity42 at a signing ceremony held this afternoon			2
the center of world demand @entity33 is typical of the market here			1
it 's a low cost carrier , numbers of which are growing rapidly across @entity53 , fueling demand for single aisle planes			2
@entity2 predicts in the next 20 years the @entity56 will need almost 7,000 deliveries of single aisle aircraft , representing over a third of the world 's total			1
" all our products are in the region in significant numbers , and we continue to dominate sales in this region because we have the aircraft @entity53 airlines need , " says @entity2 chief operating officer customers , @entity63			1
@entity70 rival @entity12 is more circumspect about the prospect of being able to announce any big deals out of this airshow			0
but the vice president of marketing for @entity75 , @entity76 , says the exhibition is just as much about bonding with customers			0
" the @entity53 market in terms of demand is about 35 % of the world demand so it 's incredibly important and we 're delivering more airplanes than anyone else in the market here , so we do have strength , there 's no question , " @entity76 says			1
the world 's two largest airplane manufacturers have spent many long hours poring over predictions for growth in @entity53 and both have come up with mind boggling forecasts			2
" the economy grows , incomes going up , and incomes going up means more people travel			0
and it 's really pretty staggering			0
if you think about the @entity56 , if you look out the next five to ten years , each year 100 million people will travel in terms of growth , " @entity76 says			0

" this is the world 's largest market for single aisle airplanes			0
it 's the largest market for wide body [ twin aisle ] airplanes , it 's the largest market for big airplanes like the 747 , and it 's the biggest market for freighters so the center of aviation is here , that 's why we 're here			0
" @entity76 says 36 % of the world 's new airplane deliveries over the next 20 years will be in @entity53 and nearly half the world 's air traffic growth will be driven by travel to and from the region			1
battleground as to who currently has the upper hand in @entity53 , @entity2 says in 2013 it won 80 % of all new business in the region			1
but it 's a more level playing field in terms of actual deliveries , with @entity2 delivering 331 aircraft into @entity53 last year , representing 51 % of all new carriers entering service here			1
aviation analyst and vice president of @entity147 has been watching the competition between @entity2 and @entity12 for 15 years			1
" i firmly believe that these things tend to balance themselves out and that one year @entity2 will have a good year , and some years @entity12 is well ahead			1
it 's all about timing in terms of where they are in their product cycles			0
" @entity2 says it 's already received 814 orders for its @entity2			0
thirty percent of orders have come from @entity160 airlines including @entity162 's @entity161 and @entity163			0
@entity2 claims its current @entity53 order backlog is 1,740			2
@entity12 says its order backlog in the region is around 1,000 planes			0
on the single aisle side , @entity12 's main @entity53 - based customer is @entity171 's @entity170			2
the airplane maker has long dominated the wide body market , with customers including @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity161 , @entity163 and some @entity178 airlines			0
with tuesday 's announcement , competition just stepped up a notch in this critical market and both @entity12 and @entity2 are keen to get as much leverage as possible out of this year 's @entity5			1
