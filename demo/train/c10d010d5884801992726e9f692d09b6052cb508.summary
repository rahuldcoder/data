-- in what the interior minister calls one of @entity6 's largest operations against @entity7 , security services said thursday they arrested three suspected terrorists who might have been plotting attacks on @entity11 or @entity12 targets			1
two of the men were arrested wednesday and the third thursday , @entity6 interior minister @entity13 said			2
the @entity16 said the men were " ready to act in @entity6 and @entity18			2
" one of the men is @entity20 , and the other two are believed to be of @entity24 - @entity23 origin			2
police sources said they had gathered enough explosives to " blow up a bus			2
" the two men arrested wednesday were on a bus traveling to @entity30 when police detained them , and @entity13 said they " resisted fiercely			1
" police sources said they were stopped in @entity34 , a town about midway between @entity35 and the country 's southern coast			2
previously on @entity0 : @entity6 @entity39 terror suspects arrested in @entity40 the third was held in the province of @entity43 on @entity6 's southern coast			0
the investigation is in its early stages , but @entity6 security services say the men were most likely plotting to attack the joint @entity11 - @entity6 naval base at @entity50 or @entity12 interests in @entity52 , according to @entity53 , a senior international terrorism analyst at @entity54 in @entity35 who was briefed by @entity6 security services on the investigation			1
they base their belief on a number of factors : the group 's capabilities ; the proximity of the targets -- @entity50 is in @entity43 and @entity52 is adjacent to it ; and the fact that several of the men had mastered flying motorized paragliders , which leads investigators to believe the group may have been plotting to launch an attack from the air			1
the @entity20 man also worked in @entity52 , @entity53 said			0
according to @entity53 , @entity6 security services believe the alleged cell might have also been plotting a terrorist attack in @entity30 , leading to the two arrests on the bus to @entity30			1
security services do n't rule out the possibility they had planned an attack elsewhere in @entity18 , though no intelligence indicates they were a threat to the @entity83 , @entity53 said			1
explosives were found in the apartment of one of the suspects in the area of @entity89 , just across the border from @entity52 , and security services believe more explosives were removed from the apartment in the past two days , @entity53 said			1
@entity6 police are still searching for explosives in the neighboring town of @entity89 , where they suspect the men had stored bombs and documents			2
wiretaps indicate that the @entity20 citizen 's wife had " removed evidence from the house " before the arrest			0
they are also analyzing the computers and files on a laptop that belonged to one of the arrested men			0
read more about @entity7 on @entity0 's @entity113 blog one of the @entity23 suspects was a " true specialist in chemicals , " security services told @entity53			1
authorities did not release the men 's names , but a police source gave the @entity23 suspects ' initials as @entity124 and @entity125 , and the @entity20 suspect 's initials as @entity129 the source said the men were carrying no documentation when they were arrested			1
@entity6 security services suspect the alleged terrorist cell of having ties to the @entity135 terror group @entity134 , @entity53 told @entity0 , and they believe one or more of the trio received terrorist training in @entity138 and @entity135			1
the alleged cell was first detected in @entity6 around a month ago but had been previously tracked by other @entity141 intelligence agencies , according to the @entity6 @entity16			0
@entity6 's interior minister said the suspects had information about remote - controlled airplanes , and some of them " have experience producing explosives and car bombs and training in shooting			1
" @entity53 said the alleged terrorist cell 's operation was different from other recent terrorist plots in @entity6 that were the work of " self - starting , self - radicaling " @entity156 militants			0
he said @entity6 investigators believe this cell was dispatched from overseas to carry out a terrorist attack			0
@entity53 said this was not the first alleged terrorist cell linked to @entity134 to be arrested in @entity6			0
a group linked to a militant with ties to @entity134 who had trained in @entity166 was arrested in @entity167 in 2004			0
@entity169 and @entity141 intelligence officials suspect that @entity134 is responsible for the 2008 @entity171 terrorist attacks and that it has established closer ties with @entity7 in recent years			0
one of its members was @entity175 , a @entity11 citizen of @entity135 descent , who was convicted of helping to plan the @entity171 attacks and plotting to attack a @entity179 newspaper that had published cartoons of the @entity181			1
according to court documents , @entity134 commissioned @entity175 to research targeting the newspaper , but the group never went through with the plot			0
a jihadist website associated with @entity7 posted a request earlier this year asking for " lone wolves living among the enemy " who could speak @entity6 , a request that @entity6 police interpret as a call for suicide bombers			0
