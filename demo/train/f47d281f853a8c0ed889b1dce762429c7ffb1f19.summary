-- many people are wondering why there are so few clues about the fate of @entity5 , beginning with the lack of a distress call			1
this lack of a call , however , is not particularly perplexing			2
an aviator 's priorities are to maintain control of the airplane above all else			1
an emergency could easily consume 100 % of a crew 's efforts			2
to an airline pilot , the absence of radio calls to personnel on the ground that could do little to help the immediate situation is no surprise			2
this investigation may face many parallels to @entity26 447 , an @entity27 that crashed in an area beyond radar coverage in the ocean north of @entity31 in june 2009			0
like the @entity26 plane , the @entity33 aircraft was a state - of - the - art , fly - by - wire airplane ( a @entity37 777 ) with an excellent safety record			1
the @entity26 flight 's string of events was precipitated by onboard faults that were automatically transmitted to the airline 's headquarters during its final minutes			1
while they lacked any flight parameters , these maintenance fault messages gave key clues , though not a definitive cause of that accident , before any wreckage was found			1
flight data recorders are key the recovery of the @entity55 aircraft 's flight data and cockpit voice recorders would be important in determining the cause of the accident			1
flight data recorders contain data from more than 1,000 aircraft parameters , including altitude , vertical speed , airspeed , heading , control positions and parameters of the engines and most of the aircraft 's onboard systems , captured several times per second			1
the cockpit voice recorder archives the last hours of not just cockpit voices and sounds but also all radio and onboard inter-airplane communications			0
a multinational team of expert investigators will be looking far beyond just the flight recorders			1
the detailed history of the flight crew and the airplane will be closely reviewed as well who was traveling on two reportedly stolen passports			0
once the wreckage is located , an examination of the debris and its distribution will tell investigators if the airplane was intact upon impact and the angle at which it hit			0
metallurgical and chemical analysis of the parts will determine the stresses and angles that caused the parts to fail , and if explosives were present			0
these findings of fact will drive the creation of theories by investigators about what caused the loss of the airplane and its passengers			0
as an example of investigators ' capabilities , we can look at the case of @entity112 103 , a @entity113 brought down over @entity114 in december 1988			0
investigators were able to identify in amazing detail the sequence of events and even the individual suitcase and radio that held the explosives that destroyed the airplane			0
opinion : when passenger jets mysteriously disappear difficulty of the search @entity5 's route heading north from @entity126 was over sparsely populated and heavily forested mountainous areas of @entity55 and the @entity128			1
reports of a possible course reversal observed on radar could be the result of intentional crew actions but not necessarily			0
during @entity26 447 's 3Â½ - minute descent to the @entity136 , it too changed its heading by more than 180 degrees , but it was an unintentional side effect as the crew struggled to gain control of the airplane			2
the distance between the north shore of @entity55 and the southern shore of @entity145 of 250 miles is about equal to the distance between @entity147 and @entity148			0
the flight 's last telemetry data , as reported by flightaware.com , shows the airplane at 35,000 feet			1
even with a dual engine failure , a @entity153 is capable of gliding about 120 miles from that altitude			0
this yields a search area roughly the size of @entity159 , with few clues within that area where remains of the aircraft might be			1
the visual search for any pieces of the airplane that may be floating or visible through dense jungle is under way and indeed a daunting task			0
in the case of the @entity26 plane , it was five days of intensive searching before the first floating wreckage was found			2
it took nearly two years to locate the remains of the aircraft on the ocean floor 12,000 feet below , broken into thousands of pieces by the impact with the water			0
location of the wreckage may be aided by underwater locator beacons on the airplane 's flight recorders , if they have not been damaged in the impact like those on the @entity190 plane were			1
in contrast , the @entity128 has a maximum depth of only 260 feet , with the average being about 150 feet			0
if the aircraft is in the water , it should make recovery easier than the long and expensive effort to bring up key parts of the @entity26 plane from the 2Â½ - mile deep ocean , where most of the airplane and many of its victims remain			1
the wreckage of the @entity26 flight was located in april 2011 , with the flight recorders recovered and analyzed that may			1
the cause of the crash was the crew 's loss of control of the airplane after the speed sensor probes became clogged while flying through a storm in the tropics			2
it caused the loss of reliable airspeed indications , the autopilot to disconnect and the flight controls to degrade			0
the investigation of @entity5 will be sure to take many months , if not years			2
we will know the truth of what happened when the aircraft is found and the recorders and wreckage are analyzed			1
in the meantime , speculation is often inaccurate and unproductive			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity232 .			2

pilot @entity232 : it 's not surprising that there was no distress call from @entity5
he says pilots are trained to focus on maintaining control of aircraft above all
he says finding flight data recorders , wreckage key to *understanding* what happened
@entity232 : based on plane 's last position , the search area is *extremely* large
