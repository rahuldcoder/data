the @entity1 imposed sanctions tuesday on leaders of the jihadist @entity4 in @entity5 , hours after the @entity0 moved to blacklist the rebel group as a foreign terror organization linked to @entity8 in @entity9			1
the @entity1 also sanctioned two armed militia groups that operate under the control of the @entity16 government , @entity11 and @entity12 , it said			1
@entity16 opposition groups have voiced their opposition to the @entity20 move against the rebel fighters , suggesting that they are being targeted because they oppose a new anti-government coalition			1
the move came the same day president @entity24 recognized the leading @entity16 opposition coalition as the legitimate representative of the country 's people			1
" we 've made a decision that the @entity31 is now inclusive enough , is reflective and representative enough of the @entity16 population that we consider them the legitimate representative of the @entity16 people in opposition to the @entity42 regime , " he told @entity34 's @entity33			2
in recent months , the radical @entity43 @entity4 has emerged as one of the most effective groups in the @entity16 resistance , drawing on foreign fighters with combat experience in @entity9 and elsewhere			1

@entity0 spokeswoman @entity58 confirmed tuesday that the @entity4 had been added to the list of aliases for @entity8 in @entity9 , already designated a foreign terrorist organization			1
she said the group had claimed nearly 600 attacks in several cities in the past year , including suicide bombings , and was responsible for the deaths of " numerous innocent @entity16			2
" @entity4 " has sought to portray itself as part of the legitimate @entity16 opposition while it is , in fact , an attempt by @entity73 to hijack the struggles of the @entity16 people for its own malign purposes , " she said			1
the designation makes it illegal for any @entity20 citizen to give " material support or resources , " including money , training or weapons , to @entity4 fighters			1

the measure means that any assets they may hold in the @entity20 are blocked and that @entity20 citizens are barred from doing business with them			0
the @entity1 sanctions against pro-government groups target two @entity12 commanders , named as @entity101 and @entity102 , along with the two militia groups			1
its statement said the @entity12 have " operated as a direct action arm of the government of @entity5 and its security services , " working alongside its intelligence services , and have been " complicit in the commission of human rights abuses in @entity5 , including those related to repression			0
" " since the beginning of the unrest , the @entity12 have fired into crowds of peaceful @entity16 demonstrators , shot and killed @entity16 demonstrators , arbitrarily detained @entity16 civilians , and shot @entity16 soldiers who refused to fire on peaceful demonstrators , " it said			0
the @entity11 militia has " conducted unilateral and joint operations with @entity16 military and security elements against the @entity16 opposition " that have led to the deaths of opposition members , the statement said			1
it accuses @entity132 of training , funding and arming the @entity11 militia			0
@entity53 's move comes a day ahead of a @entity5 meeting scheduled in @entity137			0
the goal of the designation is to isolate extremist groups in @entity5 while giving a boost to the new political opposition group unveiled last month in @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity20 officials said last week			1
@entity4 and several other groups last month announced their opposition to the @entity31 , a new anti-government coalition			1
@entity20 officials estimate @entity4 members represent about 9 % of rebel forces in @entity5			1
the @entity150 , a @entity151 - based opposition group , said fighters from the @entity4 were among rebel forces who it says have seized control of a government military base in the @entity159 area of western @entity160			2
but their designation as a foreign terrorist group is n't being made on the grounds of past or possible future actions , according to the @entity150 's @entity165			1
" the @entity20 decided to single out the @entity4 because of their recent rejection to the political opposition front and ( because ) they have a different approach to @entity171 's @entity5 , " he said			1

but the @entity172 , a largely expatriate opposition group , on sunday voiced its " full rejection of any accusation of extremism and terrorism to any of the forces that are fighting the @entity16 regime			2
" any accusations made against factions within the @entity199 , which brings together disparate groups , were intended to cause division within its ranks and between its forces and the @entity16 people , it said			2
" terrorism is a characteristic that can only be attributed to the @entity16 regime , " it said			0
the commander of the @entity208 of the @entity209 , a rebel group , criticized the @entity20 move in a statement , saying the international community " should have designated @entity42 , his army and his criminal thugs on that list first and last for what they are committing against our people			0
" the group said it would " refuse to be dragged into these @entity222 accusations against any group " and would continue to back @entity4 and any other faction fighting government forces			0
@entity20 officials have previously said the jihadist @entity4 has not affiliated itself publicly with @entity8 in an apparent effort to appear more mainstream			2
the group has claimed responsibility for complex attacks in @entity178 and @entity160 , frequently involving suicide bombers			0
at least 165 people were killed tuesday across the country , according to the opposition @entity234			0

when rebels sent in people to negotiate with the militia , they were taken hostage and later killed , the council said			0
women and children attempting to escape were also killed , it said			0
@entity16 state news , citing a military source , denied any attack in @entity237			1
@entity247 is unable to confirm casualty reports as the government has severely restricted access by international journalists			0
the meeting in @entity137 this week follows a renewed international push for a diplomatic solution to the crisis in @entity5 , amid concerns about the potential use of chemical weapons			0
@entity20 defense secretary @entity284 told reporters tuesday , however , that intelligence about new attempts by @entity16 government forces to move chemical weapons " has really kind of leveled off			2
" @entity20 officials said last week that they had seen intelligence suggesting that @entity16 military units might be preparing chemical weapons for use , prompting strong warnings from international figures			2
" we have n't seen anything new indicating any aggressive steps to move forward in that way , " @entity284 said			0
" but we continue to monitor it very closely , and we continue to make clear to them that they should not under any means make use of these chemical weapons against their own population			0
that would produce serious consequences			0
" @entity284 said he would like to believe that @entity42 has gotten the message : " we 've made it pretty clear and others have as well			0
" but , he added , " you know it 's also clear that the opposition continues to make gains in @entity5 , and our concern is that if they feel like the regime is threatened with collapse that they might resort to these kinds of weapons			0
" president @entity24 has said that any use of chemical weapons would cross a " red line , " eliciting a swift @entity20 reaction			1
@entity16 state - run media said monday that the @entity20 has falsely accused @entity5 of considering the use of chemical weapons .			1
