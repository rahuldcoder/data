-- as a little girl , she never got a valentine at school parties			1
as a teenager , she never had a best friend , a boyfriend or a date			1
as a woman , she 's never had a relationship			1
she 's never been kissed			1
her dream to one day become a wife and mother is fading as she grapples with the reality that it may never happen			1
@entity15 , 31 , was born with hemifacial microsomia and @entity17 , two birth defects that left her with a disfigured face			1
@entity21 microsomia causes a malformation of the ear and / or the structure of the lower jaw			1
@entity17 is a congenital condition that produces abnormalities of the head and the bones of the spinal column			1
it usually affects the appearance of eyes , ears , facial bones and the mouth			1
both conditions are complex , as are their names			1
but for a little girl facing a big world , the names were simple : monster			1
@entity15 was raised in @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , in a home where love and acceptance were given freely			1
her father died soon after @entity15 's first birthday			1
her mother , a strong , loving woman , readily took on the challenge of raising @entity52 and her sisters			1
that included arranging for multiple surgeries at hospitals far from home			2
@entity15 's recoveries were lengthy and painful , recalls older sister @entity59			1
" but even then @entity15 had a positive attitude			1
she was a trouper who kept her smile and did n't complain			2
" ' @entity64 ' : photographer rejects first impressions at home , @entity52 's looks were not an issue and she was treated the same as her sisters			2
she knew she looked a bit different , and she knew it caused her to be in the hospital a lot , but she had a child 's innocence and accepted it as normal			2
when it was time to start school , she discovered how different she actually was			2
she spent a lonely childhood excluded from nearly everything			2
she accepted the name - calling as part of her life and seemed to understand that crying or fighting back only made it worse			2
so she quietly endured it			1
she remembers that pain and humiliation well			2
" as an adult , it 's hard to stand by silently when you know what these kids are going through , " @entity15 says			1
" but it 's equally difficult to speak out when you do n't feel empowered to do so			2
" as she got older , the name - calling was more often behind her back than to her face			1
by the time she reached high school , she had learned there would be no friends , parties or dates for a girl who looked like a freak			2
" it hurt , but there was nothing i could do to change it , " she says			2
while day - to - day encounters with strangers brought the same hurtful stares and comments , @entity15 was used to it			1
then came a day with such cruelty it remains a vivid memory			2
" for graduation my sister gave me a gift certificate for a manicure and pedicure			2
i 'd never had one before , and it was a wonderful experience			2
i left the spa feeling truly pretty for the first time in my adult life			1
" but less than a block from the salon , she encountered a carload of boys who slowed to look at her and began pointing and calling her names			0
distraught , she walked as quickly as she could to get away from them , thinking all the while that she was not beautiful after all			0
" the pretty nails made no difference at all			0
shamed and humiliated , i realized i was still the same girl that everyone made fun of , " she recalls			0
" i remember that day as one of the worst			0
" talking to someone with a chronic illness but time can ease all wounds , and her determined spirit taught her to find the good around her			0
she has a core group of girlfriends and relatives who cherish her as she is			0
she speaks proudly of being able to provide for herself , thanks to her job at @entity151 , where she spends her days handling customer requests			0
the company was recognized this year as a diversity leader corporation , a recognition that only adds to @entity15 's pride			1
there are many adventures in life that she is hesitant to embrace , even though she is physically able			0
she prefers not to shop alone			0
she has never been on a true vacation , saying the thought of one is scary			0
yet it 's a feat she is determined to accomplish			0
she is saving now for a trip to @entity165 to visit either @entity166 or comic - con			0
" i 'm kind of a geek and play the online @entity169 with my sister and her husband , and we always talk about how cool it would be to go there , " she says			0
" people dress up so i would feel ' normal ' , not out of place			0
" she 's quick to point out she has no interest in visiting a theme park geared toward children , where she 'd likely be subjected to stares as parents attempt to answer questions about her			0
she wishes she could open the dialogue about individuals with malformations by educating people , especially children , whose natural curiosity can eventually become cruelty if left unaddressed			1
" educating them early on would help them learn to be more tolerant of others who are different			0
the ability to love , share , bring happiness and help others is the real beauty of a person , " she says			0
" the exterior does n't necessarily reflect the beauty that often lives inside			0
and when people fail to remember that , they can miss out on the love and friendship of a truly special person			0
" @entity15 is truly beautiful			1
she 's always seeing the best in others and never has an unkind word for anyone			0
in @entity15 's world , others always come first			1
she 's full of laughter and smiles			0
when you spend a day with her , you go home feeling good about yourself			0
" @entity52 welcomes the opportunity to teach all of us to see beyond the surface			0
but until then , she continues to hope for good days in her own life , which for her means days when she is ignored			0
" when i go out to dinner with my friends and no one stares at me or asks to be moved to a table further away from me , that 's a good day , " she says			0
in spite of it all , @entity15 is quick to point out her many blessings : being able to share a home with her family , having a job she loves , having good friends and a good health care system to help with the cost of a lifetime of surgeries			1
her only regret ? " i have so much love to give and i would love to share that with a family of my own			0
i understand it will probably never happen , and i 'm learning to accept it			1
but i am sad about it , " she says			0
" it feels like the one great loss in my life			0
" @entity15 will be on the @entity245 for a live discussion thursday night at 8 p.m. et.			1

birth defects left @entity15 with a disfigured face
growing up , she endured cruel treatment from others
she wishes she could open the dialogue and educate others about malformations
@entity15 wants to be a wife and mother , but accepts that may never happen
