-- save the panda ! sure : how could the world do without such cute , endangered creatures ? and tigers			1
never mind that the adult of the species will happily rip your head off and lick its lips afterward , can you think of a better mascot for a creature threatened with extinction than those adorable , fluffy feline cubs ? ( miaow ! ) trouble is , goofy humans that we are , we tend to equate ( what we consider ) beauty with importance in the ecological scheme of things			0
in fact , nature 's many repugnant , repulsive -- or just very small -- denizens can be just as important for the environment 's health			2
the monkey with the hideous schnoz it 's just that the proboscis monkey ( with its frankly obscene schnoz ) , the pubic louse ( whose name speaks for its own , hideous self ) and the aptly named blobfish tend not to front animal conservation campaigns			1
or none that anyone 's ever heard of			0
the @entity43 group , sounding like something that 's just funny - walked out of a @entity46 film , is , it says , dedicated " to raising the profile of some of @entity50 's more aesthetically challenged children			2
" to the end of saving ugly endangered creatures , reports @entity53 , the @entity41 is in search of a mascot -- something nice and slimy , like the jumping slug , or just malformed - looking and squat , like the @entity60 kakapo parrot			1
introducing the hagfish the group has garnered public nominations for those neglected organisms -- also including the hagfish , the purple pig - nosed frog and the giant @entity68 earthworm -- that make us shudder , but that no doubt consider each other ethereally beautiful after a pint of slime or two			1
and that possibly also think @entity75 and @entity76 look like bats ' bums			0
comedians will champion the public 's nominations at money - raising gigs for the @entity41 later this month and next			2
read more : are these the world 's cutest creatures ? in the meantime , the gallery above shows off some of the most unfortunate beasts from the @entity90 's shortlist and elsewhere on the @entity91			0
