@entity1 's family attorneys support @entity4 gov. @entity3 's call for peaceful protests once the a grand jury rules in officer @entity8 's case , but they also had some words of admonition for him thursday			1
the family implored that would - be protesters refrain from the looting and violence that marred the early protests in @entity16 , @entity4 , said attorney @entity17			1
such behavior diminishes the opportunities for healing and derails productive dialogue , he said			2
it 's equally important , though , to implore that authorities use " reasonable restraints " in dealing with protesters , the attorney said			2
he went on to blame assault rifles , manhandling , tear gas , rubber bullets and false arrests for agitating the protesters who took to the streets after @entity8 shot and killed @entity1 on august 9			2
" these acts of violence impacted innocent men , women and children simply exercising their rights , " @entity17 said , adding , " a strong message of zero tolerance should have been conveyed to all			2
" many observers have expressed concern that if @entity8 is not indicted , chaos could ensue in @entity16 and beyond			0
@entity3 this week vowed to crack down on any " ugliness , " and some criticized the governor for directing his remarks only at protesters			2
though the grand jury technically has until january to issue its decision , the ruling is expected in mid-november -- any day now			1
@entity17 did not provide specifics on when the ruling might come other than to say , " we 're probably getting to the end of the witness list			0
" at the news conference in front of a @entity63 courthouse in @entity64 , attorney @entity58 , who also represents the @entity59 , reiterated @entity17 's call for calm and , in a remark directed at law enforcement , said , " we would like to thank you in advance for not having a repeat of the horrific events that happened in august			2
" @entity58 declined to discuss a widely reported story that famed pathologist @entity75 , who is in the @entity1 family 's employ , was testifying before the grand jury , other than to say the prosecutor 's office extended the invitation to testify and @entity75 will provide " insightful analysis " that will help the grand jury make its decision			1
asked if revealing @entity75 's testimony jeopardized the secrecy on which grand jury proceedings rely , @entity58 repeated an oft - uttered assertion : he believes there was sufficient probable cause to arrest @entity8 and provide him due process transparently rather than via a closed - door grand jury hearing			1
" historically , they 're going to do whatever the prosecutor wants them to do , " @entity58 said of the grand jury			1
police union attorney : " it 's not about taking a side " the @entity1 family 's attorneys spoke about an hour after the attorney for the @entity104 @entity103 told @entity105 that when it comes down to @entity8 and @entity1 , " it 's not about taking a side			1
" conversations about race and how police officers conduct themselves did n't begin after @entity8 killed the unarmed teenager , said @entity111 , general counsel for the labor organization , in a brief interview			1
" it 's a fallacy to assume this all just happened on august 9			0
there 's a lot of history here , both good and bad , " he said			0
" it wo n't finish when the grand jury comes back			1
there 's a lot left to be done			0
" and it is n't about standing behind either @entity1 or @entity8 , he said , not even when it comes to the labor organization representing @entity104 police			1
" their position is , ' look , justice is a process			0
' they support the process , " @entity111 said			0
" it 's not about taking a side			0
it 's about understanding the process , and they do			0
and they encourage everyone -- everyone -- to pay attention to that process because it is something that people can trust			0
" asked if the union knew @entity8 's side of the story -- the grand jury consideration of which has left @entity16 and the surrounding area on edge -- @entity111 said it did not			1
" what they know , of course , is what everyone has read in the newspapers , and they 're in a position where they , like everyone else , are waiting until the grand jury makes a decision , " the attorney said			1
he would not comment on whether he felt @entity8 would be indicted			0
ahead of what they fear could be violence in the wake of the ruling , authorities have said they 've been in constant discussions to prepare for the response that may follow the grand jury ruling			1
a community group called the do n't shoot @entity175 has issued 19 so - called rules of engagement in hopes of deterring the heavy - handed response for which police were vehemently criticized in the weeks after @entity1 's shooting			1
@entity111 praised efforts to keep police and protesters safe and said the dialogue is important			2
" people have tried to understand what the rage is about			0
people have tried to understand what the fury is , " he said			0
