-- @entity1 fired four goals as @entity3 demolished @entity4 5 - 1 on thursday night to all - but ensure an all - @entity6 final in the @entity7			1
the @entity9 club took the lead through @entity11 just before halftime after dominating the opening period , but had no answer in the second spell against the @entity6 champions			1
@entity17 striker @entity1 extended his competition - leading tally to 15 this season , matching @entity21 legend @entity20 's record total in @entity23 's second - tier competition , while @entity24 scored the other goal			0
@entity3 , who won the tournament in 2003 when it was still known as the @entity7 , will face either @entity28 or @entity29 in next month 's final in @entity31 if they successfully negotiate the trip to @entity33			1
@entity28 clinched a 2 - 1 victory at home , leaving the second semifinal evenly poised ahead of next week 's return leg in @entity29			1
is @entity39 student the new ' special one ' ? @entity4 , fourth in @entity9 's @entity41 , had looked surprisingly comfortable away from home against a team that wrapped up the national league crown with five games to play -- and whose coach has everyone comparing him to his mentor @entity39			1
@entity50 could only look on as @entity11 headed @entity4 in front with a near - post effort from @entity54 's cross as @entity3 's defense was caught out again			1
but whatever the 33 - year - old said at halftime , it did the trick as his team ran riot			0
@entity1 equalized from the penalty spot three minutes after the break after being brought down by @entity64 , then just after an hour @entity24 headed in a rebound after his first effort was pushed onto the post by the goalkeeper			0
@entity1 made it 3 - 1 in the 67th minute as he lunged to volley in a perfect cross from @entity74 striker partner @entity72 , then his diving header from @entity24 's free - kick on 75 made it a three - goal advantage			1
the 25 - year - old gave @entity4 a mountain to climb in the second leg with another stunning header from a corner in the final minute , sealing @entity3 's 13th successive victory in all competitions			1
@entity50 is on course for a treble in his first season in charge , which @entity39 also achieved in 2003 - 04 , with @entity3 also in the @entity89 final			2
@entity28 , a distant second in the league by 19 points and beaten 3 - 1 by @entity3 in the domestic cup last week , made a strong start against @entity29 as @entity95 had an 11th - minute effort ruled out for offside			1
and the @entity99 striker was involved when his team took the lead five minutes after halftime , with his header hitting the post after a superb run down the right by @entity107 defender @entity106			0
@entity108 converted the rebound for his first @entity111 goal			0
@entity29 , third in the @entity6 league a whopping 33 points behind @entity3 , stunned the home fans just three minutes later when midfielder @entity115 leveled			2
the 33 - year - old @entity74 cleverly flicked in a header from a free - kick to leave goalkeeper @entity118 helpless			0
it was a double blow for @entity28 as the set - piece came from a foul by @entity107 midfielder @entity122 , who will now miss the second leg after being booked for his efforts			2
but @entity95 ensured two - time @entity111 champions @entity28 will at least have a lead to protect , with the 27 - year - old curling in a superb left - foot free - kick just before the hour mark			2
earlier on thursday , @entity7 fined @entity130 â‚¬ 80,000 ( $ 118,000 ) and banned the @entity132 club from selling tickets at two away games and one at home			1
the punishment stems from incidents during both legs of the @entity7 last - 16 tie against @entity142 side @entity141 , with @entity130 fans accused of " discriminatory behavior " -- or sectarian chants by the club 's predominantly @entity147 support			1
it is the third time @entity7 has fined the @entity151 - based team for such an offense following incidents in @entity111 competition in 2006 , 2007 and 2009 , according the the @entity156 @entity155			0
the ticket ban for one away match and the home one has been suspended for a probationary period of three years			0
rangers have three days in which to appeal , and the club 's chief executive @entity163 said he would first wait for a written explanation from @entity7			0
" we are bitterly disappointed that our club has been placed in a position where we are subjected to these kind of sanctions by @entity7 , " he told the @entity130 website			2
" the club put its own case very forcibly to @entity7 , and the more draconian sanctions that were recommended by the disciplinary inspector have been mitigated to a degree			0
" to be clear , we condemn sectarianism and there is no doubt the mindless behavior of an element of our support has exposed the club to a very serious situation			0
the people who engage in this type of behavior are damaging the club they claim to support			0
