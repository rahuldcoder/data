-- for two years in a row , i celebrated @entity3 in the oppressive heat of @entity5 along with fellow soldiers			0
a few nonalcoholic beers and some locally grown watermelon were our replacement for hot dogs and potato salad			0
this year , as @entity16 across the nation celebrate july fourth with barbecues and fireworks , those most responsible for defending our independence , the military , will continue to fight two wars			1
and it is a shame that we will let yet another @entity3 pass us by without making substantial progress toward ending our unnecessary dependence on oil , a dependence that is funding the bullets that our enemies fire at our troops in @entity5 and @entity29			2
it is for that reason , and many more , that the fight for energy independence is being fought here at home , a struggle i hope more @entity16 will join in support of those who are fighting abroad			1
oil poses a clear threat to @entity16 's economic and national security			1
this spring we have watched as untold millions of gallons of oil flowed into the @entity43			0
but for years , we have watched as billions of dollars flowed to hostile nations to pay for oil			1
every day , we send well over a billion dollars out of this country to pay for oil -- money that could and should be used to grow our economy and create jobs			0
the simple fact is that our dependence on oil from nations in the @entity55 and other regions constrains our choices , hamstringing @entity16 's flexibility and choices on the world stage			1
too often , we are forced to consider the impact our foreign policy will have on our oil supply instead of whether a choice is in line with our values			1
every day , we make a clear choice between living up to those values ( and strengthening our security ) and prolonging our weakness as a dirty - energy nation			0
today , thousands of @entity16 are calling for a new freedom from oil -- a dangerous , dirty and vulnerable source of energy			1
this week , 10,000 @entity16 flags were planted on the @entity77 , each representing @entity16 who have pledged to free our nation from a long and damaging cycle of dependence			1
as @entity16 look to rebuild our economy , we must consider the massive , alarming and unprecedented transfer of wealth to those who do not share our values			2
@entity16 's ability to underwrite our national security always had , at its heart , the pumping arteries of a vibrant economy			1
unless we act soon , we will be held hostage to the rest of the world , not just for oil , but for the clean - energy technology that will power the next century of growth and prosperity			0
already dependent on oil , our country needs to act now lest we become dependent on @entity99 for solar panels			0
a more insidious impact of our dependence is clear in @entity16 's foreign and military policy			1
today we are forced to both pay and protect the nations that supply our oil , the very nations that fuel extremism around the world and turn a blind eye to terrorist funding within their own borders			2
that money , winding its way through shady front groups and so - called charities , ends up funding not just insurgents in @entity5 , but also in @entity29 and @entity119			0
the tragedy in the @entity43 demonstrates , in clear and often painful terms , just how unreliable our energy sources have become			0
we are forced to drill to the deepest depths of the ocean , to despoil the richness of our @entity127 - given natural treasures , and to rely on dangerously uncontrollable technologies			0
it is time for us to stand on our own -- to take control of our energy -- with sources that will not threaten our security , fund our enemies or force us to ignore our values			0
the long struggle to live up to the challenge of our values has always been difficult , but today we stand at a clear crossroads between moving beyond oil or prolonging our dependence on it			0
clean , @entity16 power is possible , but only if we commit ourselves to achieving that goal			2
in the spirit of the holiday and in light of the tragedy in the @entity43 , let us dedicate the next two decades to winning a new battle for @entity16 independence -- from oil			1
