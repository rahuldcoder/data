-- a judge on thursday denied a request for president @entity3 to testify at a court martial for a @entity6 flight surgeon who refused to deploy to @entity7 until he saw proof that @entity3 was born in the @entity9			1
the judge , @entity6 col. @entity10 , said any evidence or witnesses related to @entity3 's citizenship is irrelevant to the charges against lt. col. @entity15 , who has 17 years of service in the @entity9 military			1
after failing to deploy with his unit in april , @entity15 was charged with missing a movement , disobeying a lawful order and dereliction of duty			2
the @entity22 says the maximum punishment for both offenses -- missing his plane and disobeying lawful orders -- is a dishonorable discharge and up to two years in confinement			2
a guilty verdict could also result in forfeiture of @entity15 's pay , which totals $ 7,959 a month , according to a charge sheet provided by a group sponsoring his defense			2
@entity15 's lawyers argued that all military orders stem from the commander - in - chief			2
without evidence that @entity3 is eligible to be president , they say , the doctor 's deployment order was illegal			1
in addition to putting @entity3 on their witness list , @entity15 's lawyers had asked @entity10 to order @entity3 's official birth records from @entity46 be brought to court for trial			1
" if the president is ineligible , you need to know that , " @entity15 's civilian attorney , @entity48 , told @entity10			1
" col. @entity15 needs to know that , the government needs to know that , @entity9 needs to know that			0
" the prosecutors in the case argued that @entity3 's eligibility is not relevant because the officers who ordered @entity15 to go to @entity57 and then ordered him to answer questions about why he did n't go were his proper superiors in the military chain of command , and they gave him legal orders			1
@entity48 later conceded that point			0
the judge ruled that the matter of @entity3 's eligibility is not relevant because he did not give any orders in the case			1
she pointed out that while the president is commander - in - chief of the military , it is @entity69 that is constitutionally empowered to raise armies , pay them and equip them			0
any contention that any orders are invalid if the president is ineligible " is erroneous , " the judge said			1
@entity10 also said that military law says that a soldier 's personal beliefs or convictions are not sufficient to allow that soldier to determine that an order is illegal			0
the soldier has to have " no rational doubt " that the order is illegal before he or she can ignore it			0
finally she ruled that a military court martial is not the forum in which to determine a president 's eligibility , because the @entity87 says only @entity69 has the power to impeach and remove the president			1
afterward , @entity48 said he respected the judge 's ruling , but called it distressing			0
" it completely deprives us of any opportunity to present a defense in this case , " @entity48 said			0
the court martial is set to begin in october , but @entity48 said he 's not giving up on the matter of @entity3 's eligibility			1
" we will be giving the @entity101 in the next week or two the opportunity to take up the issue , and we are going to fight on for justice to be served in this case			0
" @entity15 is among 27 percent of @entity9 who doubt or deny that @entity3 is @entity9 - born , according to a recent @entity107 poll			1
they compose the birther movement , which demands that @entity3 present a birth certificate signed by the doctor who delivered him in 1961			1
@entity0 and other news organizations have thoroughly debunked the rumors about the president 's birthplace			0
the @entity3 campaign released a copy of a birth record issued by the state in 2007 , called a " certification of live birth , " and allowed reporters to examine the document in person in 2008			2
last year , @entity126 state officials issued a statement that they had personally viewed the president 's original @entity126 birth record , called a " certificate of live birth , " and verified it to be authentic			0
state law bars the release of the original certificate			0
in addition , two @entity126 newspapers ran notices in 1961 announcing @entity3 's birth in the state			2
@entity0 's @entity141 contributed to this report			0

defense attorney says he will appeal
