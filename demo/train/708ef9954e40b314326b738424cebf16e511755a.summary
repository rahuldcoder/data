@entity1 player @entity0 wants to tackle race			1
he says he believes talking about race freely is the key to moving forward			1
on november 25 , 2014 , the tight end took to @entity7 to express his thoughts about the unrest in @entity10 , @entity11			1
his message went viral with nearly 870,000 likes and more than 450,000 shares			1
@entity0 's take on the situation in @entity10 was n't one - sided			1
the essay allowed a more fresh approach to one of the most delicate conversations in the @entity21 : race relations			1
" anytime there 's a situation where you 've got police officers , you 've got citizens , you 've got the race aspect of it -- it 's always a big deal			1
and everybody comes in on their own side			2
everybody has specific experiences that lead them to their conclusions			2
" i really think part of the race issue is just for us to be open and honest with each other			2
" @entity0 ended his post by turning to the @entity43			1
he mentioned that situations like @entity10 stem from a " sin " problem rather than a " skin " problem			1
however , in his @entity7 post , he felt encouraged because he feels the @entity50 provides hope : " i 'm encouraged , because ultimately the problem is not a skin problem , it is a @entity55 problem			1
@entity55 is the reason we rebel against authority			2
@entity55 is the reason we abuse our authority			0
@entity55 is the reason we are racist , prejudiced and lie to cover for our own			0
@entity55 is the reason we riot , loot and burn			0
" but i 'm encouraged because @entity62 has provided a solution for sin through the his son @entity65 and with it , a transformed heart and mind			0
one that 's capable of looking past the outward and seeing what 's truly important in every human being			2
the cure for the @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity78 tragedies is not education or exposure			0
so , finally , i 'm encouraged because the @entity50 gives mankind hope			0
" the reaction to @entity0 's post was mostly positive			1
but he drew some backlash when he suggested a faith - based solution to the nation 's race problems			1
but his wife , @entity90 , agreed with him wholeheartedly			0
" his comment is based in truth			0
his emotions are his emotions , so that 's how he felt about it and that 's his perspective and i do n't think that can be argued , " she said			2
@entity0 received national attention when his @entity7 post on the @entity10 situation went viral			1
but if you are n't a diehard football fan , you may not be familiar with no. 82 of the @entity104			0
@entity0 entered the league when he was drafted by the @entity106 in 2004			1
six years later , he signed with the @entity107			0
he joined the " @entity108 " in 2013			0
@entity0 shared his @entity110 beliefs while expressing how upset he was about the fatal shooting of @entity74			1
some may have been surprised about the amount of transparency the @entity1 player displayed			1
" being a @entity110 is who you are and playing football is what you do			1
i think when it comes to football , @entity62 had provided me a platform and i want to be responsible for what he has given me			0
and it 's not comfortable for me all the time , " he says			2
@entity0 's spiritual journey began during childhood			1
" i 'm the oldest of six kids			0
we had a 15 - year gap between me and my youngest brother			0
my father is a pastor in @entity132			2
i was born in @entity133 , @entity134 , but we moved to @entity132 when i was in high school , " says @entity0			1
" my dad used to say whatever you start , finish it			0
you are going to give 100 % because you 're not doing it just for yourself , you 're doing it for the @entity141			0
" in college , @entity0 found someone who shared his beliefs			1
he met his wife at the @entity146 during a @entity148 meeting			0
" one thing that @entity0 and i said when we got married is that we wanted our marriage to be a ministry			2
it makes sense we would talk about healing and bringing people together , " says @entity90			2
and as a father of four -- soon to be five -- @entity0 knows it all starts at home			1
" i want my kids to see me as a leader , a protector , a lover of my wife			0
... daddy caring , but also trustworthy and faithful , " he says			0
the couple started the one more foundation to make a greater impact in communities and be an example to their children			0
" we decided to start the organization not only to help others , but to leave a legacy for our kids of giving			0
we want them to understand that giving is important			0
whether it 's money , food or time , giving to someone else is what we 're called to do			2
