@entity0 -- the @entity4 cabinet has approved an amendment to a citizenship law that requires new citizens to declare their loyalty to a " @entity10 and democratic state , " the prime minister 's office said sunday			1
a statement from prime minister @entity13 's office confirmed vote , saying 22 ministers voted for the change and eight voted against it			0
now that the proposal has passed the @entity3 , it will be taken up by @entity4 's parliament , the @entity19 , for passage into law			1
before his government 's weekly @entity3 meeting , @entity13 made a forceful plea sunday for changing the nation 's @entity25			2
he challenged criticism that the revision is undemocratic and could harm relations with the minority @entity31 population			2
@entity13 cited the nation 's @entity33 , which says @entity4 is both the " national state of the jewish people " and a democratic state " in which all its citizens -- jewish and @entity40 -- enjoy fully equal rights			2
" " democracy is the soul of @entity4 and we can not do without it , " @entity13 said , according to a statement from his media adviser			0
he noted that @entity4 was the only democracy in the @entity48 , and that " there is no other jewish state in the world			0
" " the combination of these two lofty values expresses the foundation of our national life and anyone who would like to join us needs to recognize this , " @entity13 said			0
@entity13 announced last week he would push now for adding language to @entity4 's citizenship and entry law that would declare a new citizen 's allegiance to " a @entity10 and democratic state			1
" after the prime minister announced the push , but before sunday 's @entity3 vote , @entity31 @entity19 member @entity67 said that @entity4 is " discriminative in its policies and laws against all who are not @entity72			1
" @entity67 went on to say the law " not only discriminates between @entity10 and non @entity74 , it also discriminates between @entity74			0
" another @entity31 @entity19 member @entity77 , from the @entity76 , criticized the move as well , saying that " the values of @entity10 and @entity80 can not be in the same definition because democracy is the equality of all the citizens			1
" " but an ethnic definition as @entity10 is the preference of the @entity10 over that of the @entity31 and therefore it fixates an inferior status to 20 percent of the population , " @entity77 said			0
@entity4 is home to roughly 6 million @entity10 citizens and 1.5 million @entity31 citizens			1
in describing the reasons for the timing of the proposed change of language , @entity92 , a spokesman for @entity13 , said , " what we are asking others to accept we have to demand of ourselves " -- a reference to the recent @entity4 government demand that @entity102 recognize @entity4 as the nation state of the @entity10 people			2
the language of the new oath would not apply to immigrants coming to @entity4 under what is called the " @entity109 " that allows converted @entity74 and people with @entity10 ancestry the right to settle in @entity4 and acquire citizenship			2
@entity4 's right - wing coalition government is divided over the proposal			1
minister of social affairs @entity117 from the @entity118 , which questions the change , told @entity4 army radio that political pressure was behind @entity13 's push for the move			0
the problem with the amendment , @entity117 said , " is not in the essence but the influence this will have on the dialogue with the @entity31 minority in @entity4			1
" recently resumed peace talks with the @entity102 leadership appear to hinge on whether @entity4 will extend a moratorium on construction in @entity10 settlements in the @entity136			0
the moratorium expired on september 26			0
the right - wing @entity138 , also a member of the coalition government , welcomed the proposed change and denied it had anything to do with a possible extension of the settlement freeze			1
" it is definitely not connected to the settlement freeze , " said @entity145 , a @entity19 member for the party			2
" we have been talking about passing this law even before the elections and it is part of our coalition agreement			0
" before the changes were approved by the @entity3 , @entity145 told @entity1 the oath was " very similar to the citizenship law in the @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 and many other countries who all demand a declaration of loyalty			1
" @entity1 's @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 contributed to this story .			0
