-- there is a story that the first time a @entity8 ' @entity7 dynasty ' king attended a concert during a @entity11 tour , he was asked what he liked most about it			0
" the beginning , " he answered , having assumed that the sound check was part of the performance			0
a similar incident happened during the @entity20 earlier this week			0
it was a good opportunity to bring together the @entity23 and @entity24 administrations in order to tune their instruments			1
while vague expressions such as " cautious optimism " were tossed around in the media , in reality some @entity28 and @entity29 journalists -- and political analysts -- were waiting to hear a symphony orchestra performance			1
this unrealistic enthusiasm was evident in the focus and media speculation given to the story of presidents @entity24 and @entity23 accidentally -- but apparently on purpose -- bumping into each other			1
at midnight @entity48 time ( the early hours of tuesday morning in @entity42 , the same day that world leaders were about to attend the @entity20 luncheon ) @entity45 , an @entity29 reformist newspaper , hurriedly decided to publish a second version of its front - page story reporting a meeting between the two presidents			1
on wednesday , the disappointed journalists published a wishful and envious headline that read " @entity56 ! " investing in the probability of a handshake , which would have been symbolically significant despite having little value in terms of political reality , raises a more serious concern			0
did @entity23 and @entity63 shaking hands change @entity28 - @entity66 relations ? having such expectations of diplomacy is like a @entity8 proverb -- blowing the horn from the bell instead of the mouthpiece			1
at a time when our traditional slow and gradual courtship process has been replaced by online dating followed by an instant hook - up , it is not surprising to expect overnight miracles in diplomacy			2

from the day president @entity86 took office in 1969 , he wanted to end 23 years of @entity28 - @entity89 hostility			1
but he did not shake hands with @entity91 until after planning , and two trips to @entity89 , including one secret visit by his @entity94 , @entity95			0
@entity96 , a member of the @entity98 's planning staff who was with @entity86 on that trip says the @entity89 reception was " sort of anticlimactic			0
" he adds : " there was n't the color and excitement that one expected			0
" president @entity23 and @entity24 did tune their instruments during their speeches at @entity20 ; @entity23 said that his administration does not seek regime change in @entity29 , and @entity24 responded that managing differences is possible			1
however , with these first indications of a change in @entity29 - @entity28 relations , one should not expect to see an immediate end to chants of " @entity117 " at friday prayers in @entity48 or across @entity29 cities			1
after @entity86 's trip to @entity89 , anti-american sentiments did not completely disappear among the @entity89 , but decreased gradually , over time			0
that shows why , in an editorial piece in @entity29 's @entity130 ' weekly paper on september 21 , a few days before the @entity20 , @entity131 , who is the head of the @entity130 political research center , wrote : " the domestic reverberation of interaction [ between the @entity28 and @entity29 ] must be in a way that preserves the people 's rage towards and hatred of the global arrogance			1
" one might find this suggestion something of a blow to the potential @entity29 - @entity28 rapprochement			1
but a closer look at the editorial shows that in fact the author gives a green light to an agreement between the @entity24 administration and that of @entity23			2
contrary to what has been said in the international media over the past few days , @entity130 commanders are not opposed to @entity24 and @entity23 dancing together -- what they do n't want @entity24 to do is actually enjoy the dance			2
they are warning @entity24 of the cunning tactics of his " expert and skilled " partner			0
read more : amanpour on why @entity24 may be different the @entity130 weekly stresses that @entity24 's team " must not express complete satisfaction with possible agreements " and continues to demand that " strong guarantees must be obtained for every possible agreement and a major part of the guarantees must be unilaterally offered to @entity29			2
" according to the piece , the back door should always remain open and no bridges should be burnt			0
such advice could enrage those who are against negotiations with @entity29			0
but the truth is that the @entity130 is looking at the situation as cautiously and realistically as some of its die - hard enemies in the @entity28 some analysts apologetically argue that the first part of @entity24 's speech at the @entity20 was merely targeted to his domestic audience , including the @entity130			1
undoubtedly , the prologue to the speech was filled with jargon and a combination of different theories on humanities and social science			0
in other words , he was criticizing the current world order and accusing the @entity189 of considering itself as " superior " and the rest of the world ( ie. @entity29 ) as " inferior			2
" it is possible that he intended to convey this message using complicated language not to draw too much criticism , but the fact that @entity24 and his accompanying team could truly believe in such sentiment and not only planned to appease the @entity29 hardliners can not be ruled out			2
the ruling elites of @entity29 are not happy with the current state of world affairs ; the difference , however , is that some leaders such as @entity24 want to change the situation and obtain a better position in the world via interaction , while others seek confrontation			1
let 's not forget that @entity29 's @entity213 , @entity214 , has tested both interaction and confrontation during his 24 years in charge			2
previously , as soon as he allowed one group to try an approach , he had to face the criticism of a rival group			0
today , however , all of @entity29 's power players are in agreement , letting @entity24 test the negotiation approach			2
for example , judiciary chief @entity228 described @entity24 's @entity20 speech as reasonable and said : " provided that the conditions are fair , honorable and [ there is ] mutual respect , @entity29 has nothing against negotiations [ with the @entity28 ]			1
" this is the first time that @entity29 's political elites have spoken in a unified voice			0

some were overly enthusiastic about meeting between @entity29 , @entity28 presidents , writes @entity241
he asks : did @entity23 and @entity63 shaking hands change @entity28 - @entity66 relations ?
do not expect to see an end to " down with @entity28 " chants across @entity29 , he writes
@entity241 : leaders like @entity24 want to obtain a better position in the world via interaction
