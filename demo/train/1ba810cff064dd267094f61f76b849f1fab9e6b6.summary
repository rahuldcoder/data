@entity0 , @entity1 -- in case you plan to see wednesday 's @entity6 debate , allow me to offer up some crib notes so you do n't get lost			1
first , when you hear the candidates talk about " job creators , " that 's just another way of saying " rich people " or " the guy bankrolling my super @entity15			0
" when someone says " family values , " that 's to remind the audience that they do n't like gay people ; " religious freedom " means " @entity22 " ; and it 's not really a @entity6 debate until a candidate attacks the " liberal media " for asking questions they 're too afraid to answer			1
now there will be plenty of other buzz words and euphemisms that will be tossed around during the debate , but since it is being held in @entity35 , chances are the most popular phrase will be " secure the border			1
" we must secure the border			2
the candidates will argue that it 's a matter of national security			0
that it is n't just the friendly illegal immigrants looking for work we must worry about , but terrorists , drug lords and other criminals who seek to make their way through our porous border			0
they will say if they were president they would build walls , add troops , even commission a @entity57 to keep this country safe			0
@entity59 has promised to build a double fence along the entire southern border , adding , " " the @entity62 must control its border			2
it is a national security imperative , " @entity65 said " if elected president , i would move to quickly end foreign nation building efforts and use many of the resources we waste playing world 's policemen to control our southern border			0
" they all will receive applause , and it will all sound great ... until you realize that " secure the border " is slang for " keep the @entity78 out			1
" oh boy , here comes the black guy playing the race card again			0
yep , that 's me -- pointing out that the @entity85 border is largely ignored in this dialogue despite being more than twice the size of the @entity78 border and less than 1 % secure , according to a 2011 report by the @entity90			1
even if we were to disregard the 1,538 miles between @entity92 and @entity85 , the 3,987 mile border connecting the lower 48 to our neighbors up north is still much larger than the 1,933 - mile stretch that connects us to @entity78			1
and yet the attention we give the northern border is miniscule at best when compared to the resources we allocate to the south			0
there are definitely reasons for serious concern about safety along the @entity78 border , but according to our own intelligence , @entity78 should hardly be our only concern			1
you would think presidential hopefuls genuinely concerned about our safety would remember that just four years ago , @entity109 , president @entity111 's @entity110 secretary , said he was more afraid of terrorists coming into the country from @entity85 than @entity78 and that his department arrested more people connected to @entity116 and @entity117 trying to come in from up north than down south			1
this is not to perpetuate the myth that the september 11 terrorists came through @entity85 or defame our northern neighbors			2
but rather to point out the glaring disconnect between some of the crowd - pleasing rhetoric the @entity6 candidates like to deliver about " securing the border " and the more nuanced reality			1
for example , did you know reports show that from 2007 to 2009 , the amount of marijuana seized at the @entity85 border jumped 22 % and that @entity110 has seen a sharp increase in the trafficking of more dangerous drugs such as heroin , cocaine and ecstasy ? yes , there are drug tunnels along the southern border , but the @entity144 also found a 360 - foot drug tunnel from a hut in @entity85 to a house in the state of @entity149 as well			1
we know an estimated 350,000 people trying to come in through @entity78 in 2011 were stopped			2
we also know that number is down from the 447,731 arrests made in 2010 and that is significantly less than the 1,643,679 people stopped in 2000			0
what we do n't know is how many people are illegally trying to get in from @entity85 , because less than 1 % of the world 's largest border is secure			1
conversely , homeland security secretary @entity160 said the @entity78 border is as secure as it has ever been , adding , " it is clear from every measure we currently have that this approach is working			1
" still , judging from the tone of the immigration talk so far in this campaign , no one debating in @entity35 on wednesday really seems to care about either point			0
why ? last year a group of senators had to petition the @entity173 administration for military assistance to catch the drug traffickers who were using low - flying planes to move their products from @entity85 into the @entity62			1
ten years after 9/11 and we still had undetected aircraft crossing the border because it was n't the border we 're scared of			0
you know , this whole immigration discussion would be a lot more productive if the people leading it would be more honest and stop pretending as if it 's only about national security			0
it 's a part , but the larger truth is that nonwhite people will be the majority in this country by 2040 and this browning of @entity62 scares the hell out of a lot of people , particularly some white people			2
the thinking goes that if the country can deport the @entity78 who are illegally here and stop new ones from coming in , maybe that trend will slow down or even reverse			2
that sentiment is at the core of the racial profiling laws started in @entity35 and is at the core of the entire illegal immigration conversation			0
it 's a clumsy attempt to talk about race without mentioning race so as not to appear racist			0
but the dialogue is transparent because if it was really about " securing the border , " the facts suggest @entity85 would be a big part of the conversation and not just an afterthought			2
follow @entity217 on @entity218 join the conversation on @entity220 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity223 .			0

" secure the border " has been a theme of the @entity6 presidential campaign
@entity223 asks why focus is on @entity78 border rather than larger one to the north
he says the @entity62 - @entity85 border is less than 1 % secure
@entity223 : hidden *message* in the debate is about race and fears of a *changing* @entity62
