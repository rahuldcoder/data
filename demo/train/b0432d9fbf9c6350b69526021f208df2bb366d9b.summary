-- disappointing news for fans of " @entity3 , " which was supposed to earn a second lease on life next year when it was supposed to resurface via @entity6 in january			1
the company that bought it from @entity9 may hold off premiering it for at least a few months and focus on getting " @entity13 " back to fans , instead , according to @entity12			1
@entity14 , a media and production company founded in 2009 by @entity17 and former @entity19 head @entity18 , bought " @entity3 " and " @entity13 " last july after @entity9 canceled them			1
( " @entity3 " ended in september ; " @entity13 " goes away in january )			2
the hope was to bow new installments of " @entity3 " online starting in january , but that was before @entity24 started having a tough time securing stars from the longtime serial ( here 's looking at you , @entity30 ! )			2
so far , only @entity31 ( @entity32 ) and @entity33 ( dr. @entity34 ) have agreed to continue with " @entity3 " once it goes online			0
in contrast , " @entity13 " 's @entity36 ( @entity37 ) , along with @entity38 ( @entity39 ) , @entity40 ( @entity41 ) and @entity42 ( @entity43 ) , among others , will stay in the fictitious town of @entity46 for @entity24 's new venture			0
along with the soaps , @entity6 is supposed to feature entertainment and lifestyle shows			1
