-- authorities have officially dropped all charges against an @entity6 who tried to snatch back his children from his ex-wife in @entity10 , the @entity3 prosecutor 's office said thursday			1
charges had been technically " on hold " since @entity12 was released from jail in october , though legal experts had said the move essentially meant the charges had already been dropped			2
the prosecutor 's office said at the time that @entity12 was released after he promised not to take his children back to the @entity6 " in this manner			1
" it was not clear whether he had a chance to see his children after his release			0
@entity12 , 38 , a @entity25 native and naturalized @entity10 citizen , allegedly abducted his children -- 8 - year - old @entity27 and 6 - year - old @entity28 -- as his ex-wife walked them to school on september 28 in @entity31			1
with the children , @entity12 headed for the nearest @entity6 consulate in @entity3 to try to obtain passports for them			1
screaming at guards to let him in the compound , @entity12 was steps from the front gate but still standing on @entity10 soil when he was arrested			1
@entity12 and his first wife , @entity41 , were married for 14 years before a bitter divorce in january			1
the couple had lived in @entity10 , but moved to the @entity6 before the divorce			1
@entity41 received custody of the children and agreed to remain in the @entity6			1
on the day that the children were to start school in august , @entity12 learned that his ex-wife had fled with them to @entity10			1
@entity12 later filed for and received full custody of the children , and police in @entity53 , @entity25 , issued an arrest warrant for his ex-wife			2
but @entity10 is not a party to the 1980 @entity57 convention on international child abduction -- though the government has expressed interest in reconsidering -- so the warrant was not recognized by @entity62			2
@entity10 law follows a tradition of sole - custody divorces			2
when a couple splits , one parent typically makes a complete and lifelong break from the children			0
complicating the matter is the fact that the couple is still considered married in @entity10 , because they never divorced there , police said			0
the children also hold @entity10 passports , @entity10 authorities have said			2
foreign parents have had little luck in regaining custody , the @entity78 said			0
@entity12 's current wife , @entity82 , said in october that her family has been ripped apart			0
" @entity27 and @entity28 had a very , very happy situation here in @entity25 , " she said			0
" they have people who love them here			0
" she said she did not think the parties could work out an agreeable arrangement regarding the children			0
" there are two parents who love these children and one of them has just been -- just cast aside			0
" @entity0 's @entity96 contributed to this report .			0
