the 94 , all @entity1 nationals , were facing various charges including establishment of a clandestine organization aiming to overthrow the government			1
the charges , according to judicial authorities , stem from @entity47 of the country 's penal code , which bans " establishing , instituting , founding , organizing , administering or joining an association , corporation , organization or any branch thereof , with the aim of overthrowing the regime of the @entity57 " the group is also accused of having links to @entity61 's @entity60 , an organization prohibited in the @entity1			1
" they launched , established and ran an organization seeking to oppose the basic principles of the @entity1 system of governance and to seize power , " attorney general @entity62 said in a january statement published by state media			1
recent statements by @entity72 said many of the 94 are members of a local " non-violent group that has been engaged in peaceful political debate in the @entity1 for many years and advocates greater adherence to @entity79 precepts			0
