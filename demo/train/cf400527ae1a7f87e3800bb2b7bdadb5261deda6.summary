-- when a @entity3 teacher , way back in 2004 , offered four students the option of learning marine science through textbook lessons or by building an underwater robot , the students chose the hands - on approach			1
it was a decision that revealed the power of experiential learning and created the opening scene for a @entity16 script			1
" i had nothing to do			2
i felt like a loser , " one of the students , @entity19 , told an @entity22 newspaper in 2008			1
without the robot club , " i would have probably just dropped out of high school			2
" in fact , all four students graduated from high school			1
" all these kids have taken what they 've learned and decided that they can be leaders in their community , " the robotics teacher , @entity28 , says in a new documentary film , @entity30			1
the film tracks four @entity36 students who started the robotics team at @entity38 in @entity3 , a decade ago			1
working under gifted teachers , the guys build an underwater robot , nicknamed @entity42			2
the fun starts when they enter a national competition that pits their machine against robots from both high school and college teams			2
no need to spoil the finish			0
it 's enough to say that the tale , with a tampon prominent in the construction of the robot , inspired a long - form piece in @entity59 , a new @entity16 feature starring @entity61 and @entity62 , and the documentary film			1
as part of a deal with @entity66 and @entity67 , " @entity30 " opens friday , july 11 , in @entity68 and @entity69 , before rolling out to other cities			0
underwriters include the @entity72 , the @entity73 and the @entity74			0
while " @entity30 " is a compelling tale about four kids who beat the odds , it carries a larger message about education reform			1
the need for reform is straightforward			0
in this century , economic growth depends on jobs for which @entity85 are not sufficiently trained , at least as compared to other countries			1
absent reform , according to the @entity89 , @entity85 firms will struggle to fill positions that require technical skill			1
how to implement reform is the sticky part			0
reforming education means altering how teachers teach			1
when i took algebra , chemistry and physics , my teachers stood at the front of the classroom and lectured			0
if i learned anything , i learned by listening			0
today , there is a belief that students learn more by doing			1
sounds simple enough , but it 's a challenge to reorganize instructional budgets , train new teachers , retrain veteran teachers and bring students and parents along			1
instruction ends up looking different than your father 's science class , as evidenced by the robotics poetry class offered at one innovative @entity119 middle school			0
" @entity30 " adds weight to the argument in favor of hands - on , experiential learning by proving that it can be accomplished in a tough setting , without lots of new resources			1
the lesson is especially critical for @entity131 education -- science , technology , engineering and mathematics -- where we must set learning on fire for children who may otherwise disengage from school			1
i first heard about the @entity141 robotics program shortly after the now - famous underwater competition , when the foundation where i work began making grants to support programs at the school			1
the students saw they could accomplish more than they ever could have imagined			2
whether they went on to become an @entity150 paratrooper like @entity151 or a chef , as @entity19 has done , their high school experience helped			0
" with robotics , the kids fell in love with building , pure and simple , " " @entity30 " filmmaker @entity157 told me in an e-mail			0
" they loved the kinesthetic learning of how things worked			2
although they did n't call it engineering , that is what they fell in love with			0
@entity168 first learned to make a catapult for @entity170 -- and they concocted a giant catapult right out of @entity172 -- and had pumpkins smashing everywhere			0
" from the film , i was struck by @entity179 's remarks on the need to develop talented young people			0
an inventor whose creations include the @entity184 , @entity179 is also founder of @entity186 robotics , which enables more than 350,000 students to build robots annually			2
i called @entity179 to ask him whether the kids in " @entity30 " represent a fluke , or whether all students could flourish this way			2
" you did n't find two needles in the haystack , " @entity179 said			0
" you found a stack of needles			0
all they needed was a little guidance , a little support			0
" let 's hope the release of " @entity30 " leads to more schools uncovering more of these needles			2
join us on @entity210 / @entity209 .			0

a @entity3 teacher gave his students the option to learn by doing
@entity216 : the *project* *motivated* students to **succeed** and has *important* lessons
he says @entity85 needs better education and training for job - related skills
bare : hands - on learning can **succeed** even in schools hard - pressed for resources
