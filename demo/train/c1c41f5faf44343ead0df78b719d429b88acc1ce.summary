could an @entity1 membership become a first - class ticket to shopping across the @entity3 ? that seems to be what @entity1 hopes			1
@entity1 has announced it will extend some of the perks it gives prime members , like free two - day shipping , on other websites			1
@entity10 , a vice president at @entity1 , made the announcement tuesday at @entity12 , an online marketing conference in @entity14			2
the first such agreement will be with @entity16 , a @entity17 fashion retailer			0
" think about the possibilities , " @entity18 , digital director at @entity16 , said at the event			0
" i can see a day when @entity1 members will have access to sneak previews and first chance to shop our new collections			1
" @entity18 said the partnership is aimed at getting new customers into @entity16 ' virtual doors			0
launched in 2005 , @entity1 is a $ 99 annual membership that grants privileges such as faster shipping and access to the company 's library of streaming movies and music			1
in addition to the fee , @entity1 likes prime members because they tend to spend more money on the site			1
the extended prime benefits are part of @entity45 and pay with @entity1 , an existing program the company has with outside retailers			1
companies pay a fee to @entity1 in return for making it possible for online shoppers to buy instantly using their @entity1 accounts			1
@entity18 said the relationship has been a productive one			0
@entity1 customers who put items in their " shopping cart " have been 34 % more likely to purchase them , he said , and spend 15 % more than @entity61 customers			0
but some retailers have been reluctant to give @entity1 a bigger hand in how their business gets done on the @entity3			2
the company has been accused in the past of lowering its own prices to put the squeeze on competitors , even to the point of taking a short - term loss on some products			0
and tech blog @entity73 quotes unnamed retailers as saying they 're not inclined to advertise their products on @entity1 -- a component of the @entity45 and pay plan -- because they ca n't control the context in which their ads will appear			2
" when we go to open a store in the mall , we 're very careful about who is around us , " one retail executive told @entity73			0
" on @entity1 , because they are serving up customized results , our stuff may appear next to some @entity89 or third party selling similar goods at half the price			0
