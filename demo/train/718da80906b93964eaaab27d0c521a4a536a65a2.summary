" i think the overall conclusion was that testing and results and targets being reached became more important than actual learning for children , " @entity2 said			0
" and when reaching targets became the goal , it was a goal that was pursued with no excuses			0
" falsifying test results made the schools appear to be performing better than they really were			2
but in the process , students were deprived of critical remedial education and taxpayers were cheated , as well , @entity2 said			2
investigators said 178 teachers and principals working at 44 schools were involved			1
the educators , including 38 principals , were either directly involved in erasing wrong answers on a key standardized test or they knew -- or should have known -- what was going on , according to @entity2 's office			1

" the investigation 's findings have been forwarded to the state teacher licensing board , @entity2 said			0
that agency could take disciplinary action against the educators involved			1
@entity0 mayor @entity81 , who was briefed on the report , said the investigation " confirms our worst fears			1
" " there is no doubt that systemic cheating occurred on a widespread basis in the school system , " @entity81 said in a statement			1
" further , there is no question that a complete failure of leadership in the @entity96 hurt thousands of children who were promoted to the next grade without meeting basic academic standards			0
" the cheating was brought to light after marked improvements in the district 's performance on the 2009 statewide @entity107 test ( @entity108 ) revealed a pattern of incorrect test answers being erased and replaced with correct answers			2
