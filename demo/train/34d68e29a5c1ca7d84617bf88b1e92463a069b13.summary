-- oil has driven @entity3 's booming economy over the last decade , helping the resource - rich country emerge from the wreckage of a long , vicious war to become one @entity9 's major economic players			1
one of the biggest producers of black gold in the continent , the southwestern @entity9 country has seen its gdp surge by several hundred percent in recent years as the hangover from long conflicts turned into a hunger for profits			1
more than 90 % of @entity3 's revenue comes from oil production , but despite its oil wealth , @entity3 remains largely impoverished			1
in @entity28 , the vibrant capital of @entity3 , shiny new boardwalks , luxury properties and an influx of @entity26 expats are all signs of oil money in a city that was last year named as the world 's most expensive for expats			1
but despite the numerous new developments and @entity28 's shiny facade , inequality prevails read related : is oil - rich @entity3 a development success ? next to the sleek skyscrapers and luxury apartments , ramshackle shantytowns and crowded slums spread for miles in every direction , housing millions of people living on less than $ 2 a day			2
in many cases , even basic necessities like water and electricity are lacking			0
activists like @entity51 say the much - vaunted oil wealth bypasses ordinary people in the country , run by president @entity55 since 1979			1
" we do n't see the money that is being generated from oil having direct impact on people 's livelihoods , " said @entity51 , @entity3 program manager of the @entity56			1
" @entity3 makes a lot of money out of oil , there is no doubt about this , " he added			2
" @entity3 is one of the few countries that can really pay its national budget without any donor funding , which is great			0
but where this money goes , that 's the biggest issue			0
" oil deals are shrouded by confidentiality agreements , making it almost impossible to gauge how much money goes into @entity77 , @entity3 's state oil company			1
in an exclusive interview with @entity0 , @entity78 , @entity77 's executive manager , admitted that @entity3 is making " a huge amount " from its oil			2
he said @entity77 produces " 1.75 million barrels a day , which of course , if we multiply at the end of the year we make billions			0
" when asked about @entity77 's closed books and the flow of industry revenues , @entity78 was quick to suggest that the oil money is being used for @entity3 's rebuilding efforts			1
read related : @entity3 's post-war generation but advocacy group @entity91 has contended that tens of billions of dollars of oil money has skipped @entity3 's central bank entirely and disappeared			1
the @entity94 says @entity77 spends billions off the books			0
@entity51 said oil revenues have created an enormous slush fund for the country 's elite			0
and when asked whether the oil money is being stolen , @entity51 replied : " to say that it 's not being stolen would not be true to the situation , because if the oil money was not being stolen , we could have better social services in this country			2
" he added : " someone is taking it			0
" critics have also accused @entity77 -- which is both concession - granter and regulator of the industry -- of acting as a way to funnel part of the oil revenues to the political elite			0
@entity78 responded to the criticisms by saying that " most " of @entity77 's revenues " are used to the wealth of our country and our people			2
" he added : " i would say all , depending on how you interpret it			0
because what is our role ? we have a production revenue , we put the production revenues on the hands of the minister of finance ... [ it ] goes through the hands of the government			0
" the @entity3 government denies corruption in the oil sector			1
and recently , it announced a $ 5 billion sovereign wealth fund in a bid to diversify its economy , a move welcomed by lenders for its transparency			0
the state - owned investment fund , known as the @entity146 , will invest domestically and internationally , focusing on infrastructure development and the hospitality industry			0
at the same time , oil companies will soon be opening up new oil fields off @entity3 and the country hopes to become the largest producer of crude in @entity9			1
but with a history of corruption and problems of transparency , the biggest challenge will be ensuring that the profits filter down to ordinary @entity3			2
until then , many in the country say that only a tiny sliver of elites will truly benefit from @entity3 's oil .			1

vast majority of @entity3 's money comes from oil but the country remains impoverished
