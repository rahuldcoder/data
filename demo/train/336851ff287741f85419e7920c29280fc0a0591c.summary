-- @entity1 has announced for the second time in less than six weeks a voluntary recall of ground turkey products after tests found they were contaminated with a strain of salmonella bacteria that can prove fatal			1
" that 's one of the challenges and frustrations about trying to get one 's arms around a naturally and randomly occurring bacterium that exists throughout the environment , " said @entity7 , director of communications for the company in @entity9 , @entity10			1
" it is frustrating but it strengthens our resolve to also do more to find additional methods and measures that are going to further reduce the potential for pathogens that can cause food - borne illnesses			2
" the latest recall , of 185,000 pounds of ground turkey meat , was announced sunday for products produced august 23 and 24 , and 30 and 31 from the company 's establishment in @entity32 , @entity33			1
no illnesses have been linked to the current recall			0
the previous recall was one of the largest in history , affecting 36 million pounds of ground turkey meat produced at the plant between february 20 and august 2			1
in all , 2 million pounds of the tainted meat were recovered and buried in a landfill			1
federal health authorities said the august recall was associated with an outbreak of multi-drug - resistant @entity46 , which killed one person and sickened 111 others in 31 states			0
after the outbreak was discovered , the company suspended production of ground turkey products at the processing facility for eight days and instituted stricter production processes , @entity7 said			1
in the wake of the august recall , antibacterial washes were added and " the most aggressive sampling and monitoring program in the industry " was put into place , @entity7 said			0
but federal health officials took a sample on august 24 and found the same @entity46 variant of the bacteria , one that is resistant to a number of antibiotics			2
a second sample taken on august 30 came back with a presumptive match , he said			0
" we know it came in with the birds , " he said			0
" we 're looking at the entire supply chain back to , obviously , bird farms			0
" he added , " we understand that people expect their food to be safe when they purchase it , and we are going to do everything we can to ensure that 's the case			0
" but the ubiquity of the bacteria means there could be similar recalls in the future , he said			1
the @entity86 @entity88 's @entity87 recommends meat be cooked to an inner temperature of 165 degrees @entity91 ) , a temperature that kills bacteria			1
infection with the bacteria can cause people to develop diarrhea , fever and abdominal cramps 12 to 72 hours after infection			2
the sickness usually lasts four to seven days , and most people recover without treatment			0
but , in some cases , it can cause severe diarrhea and require hospitalization			0
if the infection spreads from the intestines to the bloodstream and then elsewhere in the body , the bacteria can prove fatal , according to public health experts .			2
