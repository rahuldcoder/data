-- in nearly nine hours in detention at @entity3 's @entity2 , @entity4 -- the partner of @entity7 journalist @entity6 -- said he did n't trust the @entity9 authorities questioning him , fearing they 'd follow through on threats to throw him in jail , if not worse			1
" i have seen many stories that people are picked up in different countries ... and they are vanished , nobody sees them , " @entity12 said tuesday in an interview with @entity0 's @entity14			2
" in that moment , i was really afraid what would happen to me			0
" the @entity21 national said he did n't know what he might have done wrong , why the @entity9 government 's anti-terrorism laws applied to him , or why he could n't have a lawyer of his choosing present			1
but he did understand why his partner might be a target			0
@entity6 has been at the forefront of high - profile reports exposing secrets in @entity33 intelligence programs , stories that have made him a thorn in the side of @entity38 and some of its allies			2
@entity6 , with the cooperation of former @entity44 contractor @entity42 , broke the story of the existence of a @entity44 program that is thought to have collected large amounts of phone and @entity51 data			2
@entity12 's detention ended only after a lawyer from @entity6 's news organization , the @entity9 - based @entity7 , got the chance to talk to him after about eight hours			1
after that , the 28 - year - old was released , without materials he 'd been carrying on behalf of @entity6 , to pass onto a filmmaker in @entity62			2
he said officials also confiscated his laptop , phone and usb sticks			0
@entity12 ultimately returned to @entity21 , where he lives with @entity6			1
sitting alongside his partner , @entity6 said the detention gave the @entity9 government " a huge black eye in the world , ( made ) them look thuggish and authoritarian ( for ) interfering in the journalism process ( and created ) international incidents with the government of @entity21 , which is indignant about this			1
" the action has prompted a lawsuit asking @entity9 courts to declare what happened to @entity12 illegal because his detention was unrelated to terrorism , @entity6 said			1
the journalist added the lawsuit also demands that all the items taken from @entity12 be returned to him , and that the @entity9 government ca n't first use or share them with anyone else			1
" to start detaining people who they think they are reporting on what they 're doing under terrorism laws , that is as dangerous and oppressive as it gets , " @entity6 said			2
@entity94 knew @entity12 would be detained @entity9 's @entity95 on tuesday defended @entity12 's questioning , saying the government and police " have a duty to protect the public and our national security			1
" " if the police believe that an individual is in possession of highly sensitive stolen information that would help terrorism , then they should act and the law provides them with a framework to do that , " it said			0
" those who oppose this sort of action need to think about what they are condoning			0
" questioning was under @entity120 the @entity9 government and @entity12 say he was questioned on sunday under @entity123 , which gives authorities more powers to investigate and combat terrorism , though not without some controversy			1
in a statement that did n't name @entity12 but referred to his detention , @entity3 's @entity128 called what happened " legally and procedurally sound " and said it came after " a detailed decision - making process			2
" the statement describes the law under which @entity12 was detained as " a key part of our national security capability which is used regularly and carefully by the @entity128 to help keep the public safe			2
" but that 's not how @entity12 and @entity6 view the law , or at least how it was applied in this case			1
said @entity12 , for whom @entity142 is a second language and who did n't have an interpreter on hand throughout the ordeal : " they did n't ask me anything about terrorism , not one question			2
" " they were just telling me : ' if you do n't answer this , you are going to jail , ' " he added			0
@entity6 said he learned three hours into the incident that his partner was being detained , and he added that concerned @entity21 diplomats and @entity7 lawyers were shut out of the process for hours			1
@entity6 : @entity9 authorities trying to intimidate journalists the entire episode , @entity6 speculated , was designed to intimidate him and other investigative journalists from using classified information and digging into stories critical of the @entity9 and allied governments			1
his newspaper 's editor , @entity169 , detailed in an editorial published late monday meetings with @entity9 government officials and " shadowy @entity175 figures " in connection with @entity6 's reporting			1
" the demand was the same : hand the @entity42 material back or destroy it , " he said			0
otherwise , the government would pursue legal action to force its surrender , he said he was told			0
these efforts , including @entity12 's detention , are a threat not just to the @entity7 , but all journalists , @entity6 said			1
" what you 're essentially doing is saying that journalism is not only a crime , but now it 's actually terrorism , " he said			0
" it 's an extremely dangerous precedent			0
they clearly abused their own law			0
" as to how what happened will affect his own work , @entity6 said he 's more committed than ever to expose governments ' abuse of their powers			0
" we are absolutely going to continue to publish and , if anything , this has emboldened me , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity205 and @entity206 contributed to this report			0
