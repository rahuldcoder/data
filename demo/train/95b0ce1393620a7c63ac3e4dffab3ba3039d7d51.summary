@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity8 and @entity9 stopped paying the mortgage on their 2 - year - old @entity1 home in april , victims not of a troubled economy , but , they say , of drywall from @entity6 that they believe is making them sick			1
an air conditioning unit in a @entity1 , is blackened and corroded from @entity6 drywall , homeowners say			1
they join a growing list of homeowners in 13 states who face foreclosure or the prospect of paying both their mortgage and rent on alternate housing as they seek relief from what they describe as corrosive gasses emitted from the @entity6 drywall			1
the drywall is now the subject of several scientific studies			1
" families are being forced to make health decisions based on financial consideration , and that is fundamentally flawed , " said @entity31 , a homeowner in @entity0 , @entity1			1
" we should n't be in a position to stay in a home , based on our health , " she said			2
homeowners allege the gas is causing home appliances and copper wiring to fail and causes chronic , long - term upper respiratory infections			1
federal authorities including the @entity47 , the @entity48 and the @entity49 are studying the possible health effects of the drywall			1
most of their results are still some time off			2
on tuesday the @entity48 announced that it found sulfur , a corrosive material , in the @entity6 drywall samples it tested and that sulfur was not found in the @entity61 manufactured drywall samples it also tested			1
the @entity48 also found strontium in the @entity6 drywall at levels about 10 times higher than in the @entity61 drywall			1
@entity67 is a metal often used in manufacturing the glass for television screens			0
the @entity48 also detected two elements typically found in acrylic paints in the @entity6 drywall but not in the @entity61 drywall			1
the @entity48 said these results are not intended to establish a definitive link between the drywall and the conditions being found by homeowners in their homes			1
the @entity49 says representatives from the @entity6 government are in the @entity61 working on the issue			1
pointing to the blackened copper on their home 's corroded air conditioning unit as all the evidence they need , the @entity83 say they are n't going to wait for the government studies			0
they say the air in the home they share with their son , @entity92 , 18 , who is paraplegic with a history of cancer , is giving them headaches and causing sinus infections			0
@entity8 says she 's been coughing since february			0
" what we are doing is discontinuing our mortgage , and saving our money for moving expenses , and for a rental property , " @entity31 told @entity2			2
they stopped paying their mortgage in april			2
their attorney contacted their mortgage company , @entity107 , recently bought by @entity108 , almost a month ago with details of their plight			2
a letter to the @entity113 from @entity108 's counseling center said the bank intends to move forward with the foreclosure process			2
that does n't make sense to @entity31			0
" it 's worth zero			0
they can not sell it			0
they face the same issue we do for a potential buyer , " she said			0
@entity107 / @entity108 did not respond to @entity2 's request for comment			0
indeed , banks and mortgage companies across the country may soon find themselves in the same position if homeowners walk away and allow their homes to be foreclosed			1
" they 're having to make choices about their credit and whether they are going to lose their home , but they 're always going to pick their health first , " said @entity135 , the @entity83 ' attorney			2
according to the @entity143 , a trade group that represents drywall manufactures , enough drywall was imported from @entity6 during the housing boom from 2005 to 2007 to build 30,000 complete homes			1
but it 's possible that some of the @entity6 drywall was used in smaller remodeling projects across the country			1
so , the number of homes affected is difficult to calculate			2
meanwhile , the @entity61 government has made clear that not all @entity6 drywall is bad			1
rather than foreclosing , the @entity83 suggest the banks team with homeowners against those who supplied the drywall			1
" it 's in their best interests to join us in going after ... the distributors and the manufactures to get remediation , " she said			0
the @entity166 are now suing their home builder			0
@entity168 lives in the same @entity0 , @entity1 , area as the @entity83 , but his lender , @entity169 , has given him and his family a three - month grace period in paying their mortgage			1
in an e-mailed statement , an @entity169 spokeswoman , @entity173 , told @entity2 : " @entity169 does not comment on individual customer matters but we can tell you that our home preservation team members regularly work with customers facing various hardships , to offer assistance			0
" but what happens after that three - month payment hiatus ends is anybody 's guess			2
" it 's a great start , " @entity168 told @entity2			0
" but i do n't see anybody coming up to the plate and saying , mr. @entity168 , i know we screwed you by building a house with toxic chemicals , here 's a temporary home , while we repair what went wrong			0
" he 's moving his wife and two young daughters into a rental this month , after what he describes as almost two years of sickness and visits to doctors			0
" we have sinus headaches which lead to antibiotics , and then three weeks , four weeks later , i 'm back asking for more , " he said			0
@entity168 made a 40 percent down payment on his home			2
he 's concerned and angry about what 's happened to his investment			0
" i do n't want to lose my money , " he said			0
@entity49 says @entity1 leads the nation in complaints about @entity6 drywall			1
other complaints from homeowners are coming from @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity224 , @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227 and @entity224 many homeowner 's have turned to their home insurance companies for help , only to find that any problems would not be covered by homeowner 's policies			1
" if it 's defective , where they have to be recompensated , that would have to come from the manufacturer , " said @entity234 of the @entity235 , an insurance industry trade group			2
last week , @entity1 reps			0
@entity241 , a @entity242 , and @entity243 , a @entity244 , were successful in passing legislation that required the secretary of housing to examine the effect of @entity6 drywall on mortgage foreclosures and to study the availability of property insurance coverage for these homes			1
" it is critical that we address this problem swiftly to avoid devastating results in our communities and long - term effects on the health and well being of our families , " @entity243 said in a written statement			1
meanwhile , @entity1 's attorney general has warned consumers to be aware of fraudulent companies selling bogus test kits and quick fixes , costing thousands of dollars			0
there are no quick fixes according to state and federal experts			0
@entity31 says she wo n't be taking any chances			0
" if the fumes are strong enough to corrode metal , and copper pipe is turning black , i do n't need a degree from the @entity48 to determine if my lung tissue is at risk			0
