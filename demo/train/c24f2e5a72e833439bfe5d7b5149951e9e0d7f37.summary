@entity1 lawmakers overwhelmingly agreed on sunday talk shows that shutting down the government to avoid unilateral action by president @entity5 on immigration is not a good option " i think there 's got to be more productive ways for us to be able to impress on the president the need to work for a permanent solution as opposed to a temporary stop - gap solution , " @entity8 , former @entity9 governor and two - time presidential candidate , said on the @entity12 show " @entity13			1
" " the president ought to let the @entity22 , the @entity23 and the @entity1 @entity24 , come together with legislation that they put on his desk which relates to immigration			1
and he can veto it or not , but let the @entity22 and let this election have its say , as opposed to jumping in by doing something unilaterally -- and in a way which is extraconstitutional -- he 's poking an eye of the @entity1 leaders in @entity22 , and he 's making it more difficult for there to be a permanent solution to this issue			1
" another potential 2016 presidential contender for the @entity1 also weighed in			2
" no , we should n't shut down the government , " @entity44 gov. @entity43 said on " @entity45			2
" " but absolutely they should do everything they can to force the president to follow the law			0
" in september , the @entity52 announced that it would delay any action on immigration until after the november elections			0
shortly after the midterms , the president left @entity58 for a weeklong trip to @entity60 and @entity61			0
@entity5 is scheduled to return to @entity58 on sunday night , and the issue is expected to be at the top of his agenda			1
sens. - elect @entity66 of @entity67 and @entity68 of @entity69 both received calls from the president on @entity72 , urging compromise on the issue			0
on sunday , both resolved not to go down the same path as sen. @entity77 of @entity78 , who voted to shut down the government in october 2013 , less than a year into his first term			0
" we 're not pursuing a government shutdown , " @entity66 said on " @entity45			0
" " i do n't think anyone wants to shut down government because that does n't solve the problem , " @entity68 echoed			1
a few of their @entity1 colleagues mirrored their sentiments , with sen. @entity89 of @entity90 saying a shutdown " does n't solve the problem " and rep. @entity91 of @entity67 saying a shutdown is an " inappropriate weapon ( and an ) inappropriate tool			1
" but in rejecting the government shutdown option , republicans are now faced with a key question : where must they compromise to pass a bill that the president will actually sign ? speaking at the @entity104 in @entity61 on sunday morning , @entity5 outlined his conditions			1
" there is a very simple solution to this perception that somehow i 'm exercising too much executive authority			0
pass a bill i can sign on this issue , " @entity5 said			2
" if @entity22 passes a law that solves our border problems , improves our legal immigration system , and provides a pathway for the 11 million people who are here , working in our kitchens , working in farms , making beds in hotels , everybody knows they 're there , we 're not going to deport all of them			2
we 'd like to see them being able to be out in the open , pay their taxes , pay a penalty , get right with the law			0
" despite vocalizing his aggressive plans for unilateral action on immigration , @entity5 did concede that any executive action he takes could be undone by his successor			1
" the very nature of executive authority means future presidents can reverse those actions , " @entity5 said			1
in june 2013 , the @entity24 passed a bipartisan immigration bill that outlined provisions to create a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented residents , while also beefing up security along the border			0
more than 500 days later , the @entity23 has yet to pass a bill of its own , a situation that @entity23 speaker @entity150 insists exists because of the president 's unwillingness to compromise			2
" we 're going to fight the president tooth and nail if he continues down this path , " @entity150 said at a news conference friday			0
" this is the wrong way to govern			0
" defiant @entity5 says he wo n't bend to @entity1			1
