-- when tens of thousands hit the streets to decry an authoritarian regime -- calling for its overthrow , trying to overrun police , setting fires -- one might expect the arrival of army tanks would be met with fear , consternation and violence			1
the warm embrace that demonstrators gave troops this week illustrated the military 's respected and central role in @entity12 society			1
this fact makes the armed forces potentially a kingmaker in the current crisis , while also showcasing its challenge to somehow re-establish security without undermining its popularity			0
" how they behave on the streets is going to matter a whole lot , " said @entity27 , a @entity28 expert and senior fellow at the @entity30 think tank			2
" that 's going to be the dilemma : can they maintain the order without antagonizing the public that they need ? " the ascendance began in 1952 , when the military helped overthrow @entity12 's ruling monarch			1
its support for a constitutional democracy and its performance in various wars and battles earned it the admiration of many @entity12			2
" there 's a good reason that the @entity12 military is held in pretty high esteem , " said @entity53 , a @entity0 national security analyst , author and fellow at @entity57 's @entity56			1
" the army has done relatively well			0
" all males between ages 18 and 30 must serve one to three years , as the @entity65 notes , meaning almost every family in @entity12 has some personal connection to the military			1
still , one of the military 's biggest assets in the eyes of everyday @entity12 may be that it is not the widely reviled security force			1
the @entity75 has frequently blasted @entity12 police for torture and otherwise depriving citizens of their civil rights , including in its most recent 2009 @entity80			1
" they 're held in great disdain by their own population , for very good reason , " @entity53 said			0
" they know that security forces have tortured literally thousands of people ... for almost any reason			0
" this animosity boiled over this week , when angry demonstrators burned and ransacked police stations			0
on friday , there were reports of casualties after police fought back citizens ' attempts to take the @entity99 in @entity100 , the security forces ' headquarters			0
just blocks away , in @entity104 , it was a very different and far more festive scene : joyous demonstrators gathered near troops and embraced them , sometimes literally			2
this showering of love on the military , which were deployed friday to patrol the streets for the first time since the mid- 1980s was repeated many times over throughout @entity12			1
video footage from @entity100 showed some protesters celebrating by scaling tanks , with no repercussions			0
many of them smiled and shook hands with troops on patrol , with one soldier even cradling a baby and posing for a picture			0
in @entity126 , where at least 2,000 gathered in @entity127 on saturday , protesters chanted , " the military and the people together will change the regime			2
" that said , these same demonstrators were demanding the overthrow of president @entity134 -- a former hero in the @entity136 and the commander - in - chief of the armed forces			2
he has largely surrounded himself politically with other veterans , including saturday 's appointment of @entity142 ( a former lieutenant general in the army ) as vice president , the first time @entity134 has tapped someone for that role in his 30 years in power			1
experts are n't surprised @entity134 has moved to align himself with the military even more so , recognizing the armed forces ' place in @entity12			1
still , by doing so , he also created a quandary for the military : do they back @entity134 , whom they report to ? or do they support the people , having largely been among them not long ago and wanting to preserve their reputation ? @entity161 , a senior fellow at the @entity162 , said he expects top military officials to remain loyal to the president			1
but the rank and file are a different story , especially if they are called on to beat back civilians			0
" they 're military people for two years or so , and i do n't know that they will be willing to shoot their brothers and sisters and families on the streets , " @entity161 said , adding that midlevel officers may be most torn and ultimately determine what happens			0
through the first five days of the crisis , the 450,000 - strong armed forces appeared to trying to have it both ways : refraining from acting against demonstrators , but at the same time vowing to bring order			0
still , even as it vowed to enforce a curfew from 4 p.m. saturday to 8 a.m. sunday , there were no signs of the military doing anything to the hundreds who roamed the streets regardless			0
@entity27 , though , thinks that ultimately the military may have to decide where it stands : behind @entity134 or the protesters			1
and their decision , many believe , will determine @entity12 's future			2
" it 's all going to depend ... on where the military will be , " he said .			0

protesters have embraced @entity12 troops since they were deployed on the streets
this is in sharp *contrast* toward how they *'ve* approached the much reviled national police
the military is well represented in @entity134 's government
an expert says the military must decide how to keep order without antagonizing the public
