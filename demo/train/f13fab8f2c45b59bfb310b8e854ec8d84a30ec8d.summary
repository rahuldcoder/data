-- you 're not imagining it : airline seats are generally getting smaller			1
but while many airlines have been slimming down their seats over the past few decades , we 've been bulking up			2
according to the @entity9 , the global prevalence of obesity has doubled since 1980			0
" seats are getting smaller and smaller as airlines look to squeeze revenue from their economy seats , " noted @entity10 , the senior product manager at @entity11 , a website that rates the best and worst seats on nearly every plane in the industry			1
in the 1960s , a seat width of 17 inches was standard , and for a period in the 1990s and early 2000s , that grew to 18.5 inches with the introduction of the @entity25 and @entity24			1
recently , however , airlines been filling planes to a capacity that @entity10 calls " historic proportions			0
" " @entity30 used to fly at 70 % capacity			0
now , that number is closer to 80 to 85 % , which means every middle seat is occupied , so the elbow room just is n't there , " he said			0
500 - pound man denied seat on plane @entity24 ' view : ' make ' em wider ! ' to fit in the extra seat , passengers are now facing a width that is 17 inches and in some cases as narrow as 16 inches , a state of affairs that has pushed airplane manufacturer @entity24 to launch a new marketing campaign called " it 's the seat			1
" in a call to action to make 18 inches the industry standard , @entity24 partnered with the @entity51			1
they tested a small sample of six adults and found that passenger sleep quality improved 53 % in the larger seats			2
" if the aviation industry does n't take a stand right now , then we risk jeopardizing passenger comfort into 2045 and beyond , " said @entity56 , @entity24 ' head of passenger comfort , in the company 's press materials			1
people 's growing proportions are n't the only issue , @entity24 spokeswoman @entity63 said			1
" in the early days of jet travel , people were flying less frequently and over shorter distances			0
also , due to a lower load factor , many had empty seats next to them , " she said , adding that all of @entity24 ' long - haul aircraft have been designed to accommodate 18 - inch seats			1
ask the airlines ultimately , though , seat proportions are dictated by the airlines , not the plane manufacturers			0
unsurprisingly , @entity24 competitor @entity25 is unimpressed with its rival 's call to arms			1
" airlines ask us for the flexibility to offer a great experience for passengers in a way that makes economic sense for the airline and economic sense for their passengers , " @entity25 spokeswoman @entity84 said			1
" what they have n't asked for is an arbitrary , self - serving seat - width standard			2
" as for whether @entity24 ' campaign will make any difference in years to come , it 's too early to tell , but many are n't convinced			1
" the current trend will continue : airlines will try to make the optimal use of the space available in an aircraft due to the fact that the competition is very strong , " said @entity103 , chief executive officer of @entity104 , adding that airlines have n't changed their orders			2
making less feel like more in the past couple of years , @entity114 has been charged with the difficult task of making seats that are both more cramped and more comfortable			2
to achieve this effect , the company has slimmed down armrests to give more room for passengers ' hips and repositioned the literature pocket above the tray table to increase legroom			2
child - free zones on planes			0
good or bad ? mainly , though , @entity114 has replaced traditional foam with a netting material that adheres more to the passenger 's body			0
the result is that seats are thinner , so even if pitch is reduced , it feels as if there 's more legroom			0
what you can do according to @entity10 , the best way to eke out some more space in the air is to do what the airlines are banking you 'll do : upgrade			0
short of that , he notes , airlines treat different model numbers differently , and it 's worth looking up the model number and seat width on @entity11 before you book			0
" we 've seen complaints that a number of airlines have started putting 10 seats across on the 777			0
one customer wrote that he flew one leg of a journey on a 777 in a 17 - inch seat and flew back in an 18 - inch on an @entity24			1
' it felt like an upgrade , ' he wrote			0

airline seats are shrinking from the once standard 18.5 inches to 17 inches across
meanwhile , passengers are getting heavier , and flights are getting more crammed
@entity24 is calling on the industry to make seats wider
