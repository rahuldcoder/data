police chief @entity38 announced thursday he is stepping down " temporarily " because he was becoming a distraction to the investigation			2
the president of the @entity42 , @entity41 , said @entity38 failed to do his job			0
" the reality is that this chief had probable cause to lock up a man who shot a boy in cold blood -- because he shot a boy in cold blood -- and he failed to do that , " @entity41 said			0
gov. @entity53 announced thursday that he was appointing @entity54 of the 4th @entity55 as state attorney in the investigation			2
members of @entity10 's family were among demonstrators wednesday in @entity61 for a " @entity62 , " a reference to the attire the 17 - year - old was wearing when he was shot			2

" he 's got something in his hands			2
i do n't know what his deal is			0
" the teen started to run , @entity5 reported			1
when he said he was following , the dispatcher told him , " we do n't need you to do that			0
" shortly afterward , neighbors began calling 911 to report a fight , then a gunshot			0
by the time police arrived , @entity10 was dead			0
in a police report , officer @entity132 said @entity5 stated he was " yelling for someone to help me , " but the victim 's family said it was the teen asking for help			1
the death has sparked allegations that @entity5 took @entity1 's " stand your ground " law too far by chasing after the teen			1
police added that while it was suggested @entity5 not chase him , it is " not a lawful order that mr. @entity5 would be required to follow			1
" " mr. @entity5 was not acting outside the legal boundaries of @entity148 by carrying his weapon when this incident occurred , " @entity38 said recently			1

" unfortunately , some individuals and organizations have used this tragedy to further their own causes and agendas			0
" " @entity5 is a @entity176 - speaking minority with many black family members and friends , " @entity175 wrote			1
" he would be the last to discriminate for any reason whatsoever			0
" @entity181 , a neighbor in @entity1 , told @entity2 's @entity182 that @entity5 " had a passion for the safety of our neighborhood and he demonstrated to the rest of us that one person could make a difference			1
and he was an average guy , just like me			0
" @entity5 was a student at @entity190 , but the college said thursday that it had " taken the unusual but necessary step this week to withdraw " him from enrollment			1
it cited the high - profile nature of the controversy and said the decision was based on concern for the safety of @entity5 and the students on campus			1
heated debate has erupted over whether @entity5 used a racial slur during the 911 call , a recording of which was released this week			2
" we did n't hear it			0
however , i am not sure what was said , " said sgt. @entity209 of the @entity36			0
" i have listened to the tapes , and i have not heard them use a racial slur , " concurred city manager @entity211			0
a top @entity2 audio engineer enhanced the sound of the 911 call , and several members of @entity2 's editorial staff repeatedly reviewed the tape but could reach no consensus on whether @entity5 used a racial slur			1
whether @entity5 used such language before shooting @entity10 is key , according to @entity2 senior legal analyst @entity223			2
" it 's extremely , extremely significant because the federal government is not allowed to prosecute just your ordinary , everyday murder , " he said			0
" two people fighting on the street is not a federal crime			0
however , if one person shoots another based on racial hostility , racial animus , that does become a federal crime			0
" @entity223 said that if " very shortly before " the shooting , " @entity5 used this racial epithet to refer to the person he openly shot , that very much puts it within the @entity239 's and the @entity241 's ambit of a case that they could prosecute			1
" police say they have not charged @entity5 because they have no evidence to contradict his story that he shot in self - defense			2
@entity181 told @entity250 's @entity249 that his friend was only inquiring about why @entity10 was in the area , considering there had been documented incidents involving young black men in the neighborhood committing crimes			0
but he said that in no way did @entity5 target @entity10			2
" @entity5 is not a racist , " he told @entity249			2
" @entity5 is a caring man			1
" in @entity86 , @entity87 , former neighbor @entity260 recalled @entity5 as being a polite young man			1
@entity260 wrote a positive recommendation for @entity5 , who he said wanted to attend a police academy			2
@entity260 called the @entity264 good neighbors			2
" they were all good			0
helpful , friendly , cheerful			0
i never saw anything negative in any of them , " he told @entity2 's @entity267			0
" i just never did			0
