presidential historian @entity0 notes that one of the things that 's so special about the @entity4 address is the spectacle of the entire government -- the heads of all three branches -- gathering in one room at the same time			1
" there is something about that ritual and the hunger we all have for that oneness that makes it really unique , " @entity10 tells @entity11			2
" and there is a sense in which the ceremony -- the excitement of seeing the @entity23 justices , seeing the @entity24 , seeing the president -- reminds us of some of the pageantry that we all look for in our government			1
" here are eight @entity4 address moments that @entity10 finds particularly memorable : 2010 : @entity32 and @entity33 clash over campaign finance when president @entity32 criticized the @entity23 decision in @entity37 , the camera showed justice @entity33 shaking his head and suggesting what @entity32 was saying was not true			1
it became a big thing			0
some people thought it was rude of the president to say that			1
others wondered whether @entity33 's reaction had to do with the fact that @entity32 had been a leader against his nomination			1
before television , obviously you did n't have to worry if you looked bored or if you were shaking your head or whether you looked like you were disdainful			1
but now , especially after that moment , everybody realized , " i 'd better watch my face , as well as what i 'm saying , because the camera is there and the audio is there			0
" by the numbers : @entity4 addresses 2002 : " @entity61 " in the aftermath of the attacks of september 11 , 2001 , president @entity62 went before the @entity24 and defined the " axis of evil , " meaning @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68			1
in a sense , " axis " was such a loaded term , because the @entity71 of @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 aligned against the @entity75 and its allies in @entity77 so the idea that the world was now divided into " axis " powers and " allied " powers seemed to suggest a war coming on , which indeed was the truth			1
1996 : @entity85 declares an end to big government when @entity85 said the era of big government is over , he was referring to the @entity90 ' big midterm congressional losses in 1994 , blamed in part on the failure of the big government health care bill that he sponsored			1
what he was signaling : " i 'm moving to the center , ( and ) the @entity90 is moving to the center			1
" he then went on that year to pass welfare reform , a @entity100 - sponsored idea			0
that made some liberals mad but ensuring in some ways his re-election			1
to go or not to go : @entity23 at the address 1986 : a delay caused by tragedy the 1986 @entity4 , delivered by @entity109 , was the first one to be postponed as the @entity111 blew up shortly after lift - off on the day for which the speech was scheduled			1
@entity109 had such a good sense of timing that he realized it was more important was to directly address the @entity111 problem than to deliver the @entity4			2
he gave a masterful , emotional and classy speech from the @entity120 that allowed him to become healer - in - chief , yet another role for the president of the @entity75			1
1982 : @entity124 steals the show when @entity109 turned to the @entity127 and recognized @entity124 as a hero for jumping into the waters of the @entity130 to help rescue the survivors of an airplane crash , it began a tradition that continues to this day			0
the first lady 's box is now regularly peopled by ordinary citizens who have done extraordinary things			2
sometimes the presidents use it as a human touch on their policies or sometimes as an emotional moment that makes the @entity127 and the @entity143 come together			0
these people are generally not partisan and are somebody that people can look up to at the same time			2
@entity11 's @entity148 : @entity149 will change in @entity150 after speech 1974 : @entity152 here was @entity152 's approval rating at only 26 % , and the @entity127 was already considering impeaching him for @entity154 , and his voice was trembling			1
at one point , he meant to say that " we must replace the discredited welfare system , " but instead says that " we must replace the discredited president			0
" then he declares one year of @entity154 is enough			0
some people said at the time that what was so incredible about that @entity4 address was that it was less about the @entity4 and more about the state of the president -- here he is facing down the people who are beginning to think about his impeachment , and he has to stand before them in that assembly			1
@entity4 firsts 1964 : @entity171 declares war on poverty in @entity171 's first @entity4 , only two months after the assassination of @entity176 , he called for an unconditional war on poverty , a whole set of interrelated programs involving health care , urban centers @entity182 and more			2
what he said at the time was that he wanted something to be his own program , something that had n't been started by any other president			0
poverty was the thing that hit him emotionally , that he always wanted to do something about , so this became his signature program			0
it 's incredible that within such short time of @entity176 's assassination , he came up with a vision or a whole series of legislative programs that would eventually become fact			2
highlights from past addresses 1941 : @entity204 's @entity203 one of the best remembered moments is the declaration of the " @entity203 " in @entity204 's 1941 @entity4 -- the freedom from want , the freedom from fear , the freedom of speech and the freedom of worship			2
it became memorialized in @entity214 's famous paintings and offered a standard by which other countries would be judged			2
it still provides hope for those countries where those freedoms are not assured			0
another important note from that @entity4 is that @entity204 called for the @entity221 for @entity222 , which was then at war with @entity73			0
at a time when our country was still isolationist , eventually @entity221 passed , proving that we had educated the country to the need to do something even before @entity230 brought us into the war			0
@entity234 , in a very rare lapse of judgment , was upset that during the discussion of the @entity203 and @entity221 , the @entity100 did not clap and sat on their hands			0
she said she felt that they were just little kids , saying , " i do n't want to play in your yard			0
i do n't love you anymore			0
" she then got roundly criticized -- and rightly so -- by @entity100 , who said , " what does she think she is , the queen ? and he is the king ? and we are not allowed to criticize them ? " photos : past presidential guests at @entity4			0

justice @entity33 caused a stir when he shook his head at @entity32 line on campaign finance ruling
@entity62 's term " axis of evil " suggested to @entity75 people that was was coming
@entity85 almost reassured re-election when he signaled a shift to the center in 1996 address
@entity152 was defiant even as some in @entity24 were considering impeachment
