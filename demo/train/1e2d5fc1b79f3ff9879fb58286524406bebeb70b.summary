-- if you do a @entity3 image search right now for " cute furry animals , " you 'll immediately find yourself in a fantastic world of kittens and hamsters and ducks and raccoons			2
and , oddly enough , if you scroll down a bit , there 's even a bizarre photoshopped image of @entity14			1
it 's his head on a bird 's body			1
of course , as expected , you 'll also find more than enough puppies to choke a horse			1
( @entity25 , that does seem a rather strange and unethical metaphor			2
but , nevertheless , if gagging a thoroughbred is at the top of your outlook , i 'd think just one medium - sized @entity30 would do the trick			2
) the point here is that the @entity18 is filled with cute dogs			2
and people will usually click on just about anything that even mentions the word			0
which is why it completely makes sense that a random puppy - related news story from @entity43 happily turned more than a few heads this week , even here in the @entity45 where , generally speaking , most @entity45 do n't particularly care about whatever it is you crazy kids are doing up in the @entity43			1
we assume it has something to do with beer and moose and @entity57			0
and , mind you , that 's nothing to be ashamed of			1
well , depending on what 's happening to the moose			1
but like many , i first read about this trending puppy story in the @entity65 , where @entity66 reported that @entity68 in @entity69 , @entity67 had set up a " puppy room " to help students relieve stress			1
it 's a simple and brilliant idea			1
but if you 're having trouble picturing what this actually looks like , their advertising slogan for the three - day event pretty much lays it out : yup , it 's a room full of puppies			1
@entity83 , a third - year environmental science student proposed the idea			0
he told the @entity65 , " it fills a niche that people need right now because students are super stressed			0
" and that 's why they decided to work with a pet therapy organization called @entity92 of @entity43			1
@entity25 , i honestly wonder if the school had to specify just what kind of paws they actually wanted on campus			0
these are some rather burly people up there above us			0
so , who knows what else @entity92 of @entity43 has in stock			0
" we were n't sure what to bring , so here 's six grizzlies and a wolf			1
" i believe six grizzlies and a wolf is technically known as a @entity111			0
and in an hour somebody on @entity113 will turn it into a slang sex term			1
but long before one of this week 's planned stress - reducing events ever happened , students were already buzzing about the possibility of rolling around with little @entity121 and @entity122 and @entity123			1
@entity124 , vice-president of student life at @entity68 's student union , told the @entity65 , " we have n't even printed posters			1
we just posted a pdf poster to our @entity130 page and it took off			0
we had 1,800 shares , thousands of likes			0
it 's gone viral on @entity135 as well			1
" behold ! the power of dogs ! some students actually waited for almost an hour just to get into the puppy room -- which does seem somewhat counterintuitive since highly stressed - out people waiting in long lines usually leads to violence			1
" boy , that escalated quickly			0
" but never mind the queues			0
what 's really amazing is that -- to my knowledge -- it actually took this long for somebody to come up with such a great idea in the first place			2
i mean , when i was in college we did n't have puppy rooms			2
we had a frozen yogurt machine			0
see ? does n't have the same ring to it			0
and that 's why puppies should be your go - to answer for all of life 's problems			1
" we 're out of salsa			0
" " dude , that does n't even make sense			0
" anyway , credit to @entity68 for providing a room full of dogs for everybody to enjoy			2
it was a really clever idea , with just the right amount of pointless absurdity			0
so , here 's hoping you all mellowed out and did well on your exams			2
and if not , screw it			0

" @entity189 " is @entity187 's weekly , *offbeat* look at the *social* web
this week , @entity191 breaks down a post on a *university* 's " puppy room "
puppies , when you think about it , are the answer to all of life 's ills
also , @entity113 probably just thought of a new term for a sex act
