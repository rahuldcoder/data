-- @entity1 struck out on three pitches tuesday night , but you could n't tell that from his smile in the @entity7 ' dugout			1
he had waited seven years for this chance			0
@entity1 , 31 , was hit in the head by a pitch in his first and only @entity12 plate appearance , with the @entity13 , in 2005 and had not played in the majors since			1
@entity1 signed a one - day contract with the @entity7 on tuesday afternoon in anticipation of taking a single at - bat in the night 's game against the @entity19			1
@entity19 knuckleballer @entity20 fanned @entity1 to lead off the bottom of the sixth inning			2
@entity1 was pinch - hitting for @entity7 left fielder @entity23 at the top of the order			1
the @entity27 public address system played @entity29 's " @entity28 " as @entity1 , wearing no. 10 , walked up to the plate and took his place in the left - hand batter 's box			1
he took a strike from @entity20 , swung at and missed the second pitch and then waved at a pitch around his chin for the third strike			0
the crowd cheered loudly for him as he returned to the dugout , where his one - day - only teammates congratulated him and slapped the beaming ballplayer on the back			1
@entity1 had petitioned the @entity13 to let him come back for one official at - bat with them , but team officials turned him down			1
the @entity7 agreed last week to help @entity1 make his dream come true			1
@entity7 manager @entity49 said he planned to use him as a pinch - hitter in the middle of tuesday night 's game , perhaps in the pitcher 's spot in the lineup , according to @entity56			1
but pitcher @entity57 was pitching so well that @entity49 would n't take him out for @entity1			2
follow late - breaking updates on this just in " i 'm ready to help the team , " @entity1 said in a tweet on the @entity7 ' account			1
" the @entity7 are an amazing organization			2
... i could n't be more thankful			0
" the pitch that knocked him out may have derailed a longer @entity12 career			2
on july 9 , 2005 , @entity1 stepped up to the plate to pinch - hit for the @entity13 , who had just called him up from the minors , at @entity68 's @entity67			1
@entity70 ' pitch hit @entity1 in the head and sent him to the ground			1
@entity1 , in severe pain , had to leave the game without playing defense and no official at - bat -- it counts only as a plate appearance			1
as @entity81 and @entity82 's " @entity80 " have documented , @entity1 was dizzy for months , had blurred vision , and had trouble playing when he returned to the minors weeks after the incident			1
he eventually was diagnosed with positional vertigo			0
symptoms eventually improved , but he struggled in the minors			0
he last played professionally in 2011 for the @entity91 's @entity90 in his home state , @entity93 , where he runs his @entity95 business			0
@entity82 kept @entity1 's story alive with a couple " @entity80 " segments			2
and this year , filmmaker @entity98 made it his mission to get him a real @entity12 at - bat			1
@entity98 , a @entity13 fan and @entity103 native living in @entity104 , took up @entity1 's cause this year after he and his wife saw " @entity107 " -- a baseball movie that mentions @entity109 , who never came to bat in his only big - league game in 1905			2
" my wife said she felt sorry for him			0
i said , ' @entity109 has ( nothing ) on @entity1 , ' " @entity98 said			2
" @entity109 played a couple innings			0
@entity1 only got a couple seconds			2
" @entity98 , who did n't know @entity1 but recalled seeing the plate appearance on tv , decided he wanted to help him get a proper @entity12 at - bat			1
so , armed with credentials , he made the 2007 film " chasing october " about the @entity122 , he visited baseball training camps , trying to persuade players and general managers that @entity1 deserved a shot			0
he and a dozen or so friends organized the " @entity130 " campaign , taking to @entity131 and @entity132 to rally public support			0
they also started a @entity136 petition , it had more than 25,000 supporters as of thursday , that @entity98 hoped would persuade the @entity13 ' management to bring him back for a game this month			0
@entity98 , who met with the @entity13 in may , also contacted @entity1 and ended up befriending him as he kept him updated			0
but the @entity13 announced this month that they were n't on board			0
" @entity1 made the big leagues based on merit in 2005 , " @entity13 general manager @entity141 told the @entity142 in an e-mail			2
" while it is unfortunate he got hit in his first at - bat , he is in the @entity147 as a major leaguer and should be incredibly proud of that			0
we wish him the best , but there are no plans to add him to the roster now or in the future			0
" so @entity98 pressed other teams , eventually meeting in @entity156 with the @entity7 general manager @entity157			0
there , @entity157 told @entity98 that the @entity7 would do it .			0
