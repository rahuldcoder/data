@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity0 prime minister @entity3 will meet monday with the leader of the country 's main opposition party to discuss who will become the nation 's next prime minister -- a day after an announcement that @entity3 he will step down amid the country 's financial crisis			1
@entity3 's planned resignation -- announced by president @entity14 -- is contingent on the approval of the controversial 130 billion euro bailout deal			1
on sunday , @entity3 met with @entity17 -- the leader of the @entity18 , @entity0 's leading opposition party -- and agreed to form a new government			1
during monday 's meeting , the two will discuss who will serve in the new government as well as who will be the next prime minister , according to a statement from the president			2
new national elections will be held sometime after the bailout is implemented , but no more details nor a timeline of future events were disclosed			0
earlier sunday , @entity17 told reporters that once @entity3 resigns , everything will " take its course " and " everything else is negotiable			2
" the move appears to close one chapter in @entity0 's tumultuous political and economic saga , as @entity3 had become a lightning rod for critics for his leadership of the south @entity43 nation as it tackles a prolonged financial plight			1
it also paves the way for passage of an agreement that @entity3 negotiated october 26 with @entity43 leaders			2
the deal would wipe out 100 billion euros in @entity0 debt , half of what it owes to private creditors , and includes a promise of 30 billion euros to help the public sector pare its debts -- making the whole package worth a total of 130 billion euros ( $ 178 billion )			1
but @entity0 's turmoil is far from over			0
the bailout -- the second it has received from the @entity65 and @entity66 -- would be accompanied by additional austerity measures such as slashing government jobs , privatizing some businesses and reducing pensions			0
it also comes at a time when @entity0 's economy -- and to some extent the global economy -- is still staggering			0
though @entity0 ranks 32nd in terms of gross domestic product , experts say it wields a disproportionate influence internationally			0
economists worry that a @entity0 default on its debt could pull down larger @entity43 economies -- particularly those of @entity85 and @entity86 , as well as struggling @entity87 and @entity88			0
@entity90 finance ministers are scheduled to meet monday in @entity91 , @entity92			1
within @entity0 , the bailout 's passage would be a significant victory for @entity3			1
he has insisted repeatedly in recent weeks that it needs to be approved -- signaling that he 'd be willing to resign as prime minister , a job he has held since 2009 , as long as that happens			0
earlier sunday , @entity0 's president met ahead of a @entity102 meeting with all party leaders -- including @entity3 , who heads the socialist @entity105 party , and @entity17			1
finance minister @entity107 is likely to remain in his post as finance minister in a new government , sources told @entity0 television			2
candidates for the prime minister 's job include @entity115 and @entity116 , according to @entity0 television			0
the new government will have a life of four months , according to @entity0 television , citing sources , and elections will take place in early spring			0
on monday -- in addition to a meeting between @entity3 and @entity17 -- the @entity0 president will hold another meeting open to heads of all @entity0 's political parties			1
@entity2 's @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 in @entity1 and @entity131 and @entity132 in @entity133 contributed to this report .			0

@entity90 financial leaders will meet monday in @entity91
@entity3 wo *n't* be head of the new government , a statement says
he and opposition leader @entity17 will talk monday to plot details
the deal hinges on @entity0 approving a 130 billion euro bailout deal
