@entity0 -- depending on whom you ask , senate minority leader @entity3 's decision to scuttle a controversial assault weapons ban proposal from a broader @entity6 - backed gun control package is either shrewd strategy or political cowardice			1
there 's a little bit of truth in both perspectives , gun policy advocates say			0
" it 's not surprising what sen. @entity3 did , " said @entity16 , director of the @entity17			0
the @entity21 lawmaker decided not to include the proposed assault weapons ban in gun legislation going to the full @entity24 for consideration because including it would guarantee the measure would be blocked by a @entity29 filibuster			1
" i think there 's justification for such a ban but politically it hits right in the area where we have the biggest divide , " @entity16 said			0
@entity24 leader says new weapons ban wo n't pass the ban on semi-automatic firearms modeled after military assault weapons is proposed by sen. @entity41 , @entity42 , and fiercely opposed by the @entity43 , republicans and some @entity44			1
the ban would get fewer than 40 votes , @entity3 said , far below the threshold needed to defeat a filibuster or pass the @entity24			2
the proposal to update a similar 1994 ban that expired a decade later was one of four measures passed by the @entity53 in response to the @entity56 school massacre in december			0
instead , @entity41 could propose the ban as an amendment to gun legislation on the @entity24 floor in order to get a vote on it , @entity3 said			2
the other proposals that are part of the gun control package would expand background checks , toughen laws against gun trafficking and straw purchases and design steps to improve school safety			1
lawmakers seem prepared to tackle gun control : ' this one feels different ' but it 's the assault weapons ban that draws some of the most intense emotion in the wake of last year 's deadly mass shootings at @entity80 and an @entity82 , @entity83 , movie theater			1
congressional hearings have been filled with tearful testimony , poignant photographs and fiery rhetoric			0
they are the type of raw displays likely to spook lawmakers wary of losing votes and tank gun control reform efforts , political experts say			1
" in thinking about what is politically doable , for people who are more in the middle it 's hardest to do anything that could characterize a politician as casting an anti-gun vote , " @entity16 said			0
will states go where @entity102 has n't on gun laws ? the proposed assault weapons ban enjoys high profile support from the @entity107 , families of victims of some of the nation 's most deadly shootings and celebrities like filmmaker and progressive activist @entity115			1
gun rights advocates such as the @entity43 , the nation 's most powerful gun lobby , have stridently criticized the proposal			2
@entity43 president @entity120 characterized the measure as a " feel - good proposal " doomed to fail			2
@entity115 , whose documentary " @entity126 , " explored the nation 's gun violence epidemic , had similarly blunt words about @entity3 , calling him a " weenie " during an interview with @entity1 's @entity129 on tuesday and suggested viewers send the senator critical e-mails			0
" if a man with an assault weapon goes into the school where @entity3 's grandchildren go to school tomorrow and kills his grandchildren , would he stand in front of that microphone at 5 o'clock and say , ' i know how @entity41 ( @entity145 ) , you know , had to witness the mayor getting murdered and my grandchildren just got killed today , but you know , we ca n't get it passed because we just do n't have the votes , ' " @entity115 said during the interview			1
@entity3 has found himself in a delicate position as he tries to navigate the desires of many members of his pro-gun rights @entity21 constituency and the @entity107 and members of his caucus ' intensified push on gun control			2
as @entity24 majority leader , @entity3 has great influence to speed or slow the consideration of legislation on @entity164			2
@entity3 introduces gun violence bill the nation 's top @entity6 in @entity102 has faced scrutiny in recent months for his close ties with the @entity43			1
@entity3 twice opposed the assault weapons ban , in 1992 and 2004 , has a b rating by the @entity43 for his pro-gun rights voting record and since 2008 has received just shy of $ 8,450 from several gun lobbies , according to an analysis of campaign contributions from the @entity175			1
the @entity43 has also previously supported @entity3 in his primary races			2
@entity3 slipped a provision into the 2010 national health care law that restricts the government from collecting data on gun ownership , as reported by @entity1 's national political correspondent @entity182			0
" he 's under incredible pressure right now because he 's got , as any member of @entity102 or senator does , he 's got his own beliefs			0
he 's got the views and the demands of his constituents on the one hand and the pressure he faces from party leaders and his president on the other , " @entity120 told journalists at a @entity193 - sponsored breakfast in january			0
" so where @entity3 ends up in this debate is anybody 's guess and i think that 's one of the guessing games that 's going on around @entity0 now			0
" call to arms for a ' common sense ' gun law voters on both sides of the issue are now getting a much clearer picture of where @entity3 stands and will soon have a better sense of how their own lawmakers measure up , said @entity213 , who served as regional political director for the @entity43 during its rise to power in the 1980s and is president of a gun rights group , the @entity219			1
allowing @entity41 's assault weapons ban to stand on its own as a separate amendment " is going to work out to his benefit , " @entity213 said of @entity3 's choice			1
" having that straight up or down vote will be the most useful vote that gun rights activists and the other side will have to show this is someone who supports you and someone who opposes you			0
" @entity232 remains committed to assault weapons ban , @entity107 says @entity213 also suggests keeping an eye on which lawmakers offer amendments to strip out portions of the broader gun control bill and the roll call votes on those amendments as well			1
in the meantime , some gun control advocates are urging cooler heads as the nation awaits votes on the highly anticipated package of gun - related bills			2
" everybody needs to take a deep breath , " said @entity248 , a spokesman for the @entity249 adding that he feels @entity3 rightly calculated how to get the broader gun control measure the best chance at success			1
" i 'd rather not fall on my sword , " @entity248 said			0
" i 'd rather have a smart package so we can get it to the floor			0
" @entity1 's @entity259 contributed to this report .			0
