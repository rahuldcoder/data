-- while investigators trudge through pig farms and remote villages in @entity4 , searching for clues about the new swine flu , answers about the virus ' origin may finally appear on a computer , based on genetic codes			1
a researcher investigates swine flu at the @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16			1
at the @entity18 at @entity19 , researchers are using public databases to trace the origins of the 2009 @entity23 virus			0
they 've found that the closest relatives to the new virus are viruses that were isolated from pigs in the @entity28 in the past few years			1
their analysis , recently published in @entity30 , suggests that the virus has at least two swine ancestors , one of them related to a virus isolated in @entity34 in 1998			1
still , the relatives are distant , and it 's premature to conclude that the virus came from the @entity28 based on this analysis , said @entity39 , study co-author and assistant professor at @entity19			1
influenza is like a small jigsaw puzzle with eight pieces , each with its own function , @entity39 said			0
the puzzle changes all the time , which is why exposure does not lead to total immunity and vaccines need to be updated yearly			0
when two viruses infect the same cell , they can create yet other viruses with pieces of each of the original strains			0
this process is called reassortment			0
the 2009 @entity23 virus is a reassortment of swine , human and avian genes			2
@entity66 and colleagues are finding the closest ancestors for each of the parts of the virus and then trying to understand how these parts may have combined in the past , a complicated question			0
it is impossible to know from the available data where geographically the 2009 @entity23 virus came from , but with more samples , researchers may be able to decipher more clues , he said			0
just from looking at the genetic code , it is unknown what species is the virus ' host , how easily it is transmitted and how deadly it is			0
" we have a set of letters that you can try to map , and then you can try to see how this map is working , how would you know if a particular combination is giving you something ? that 's something that has to be solved			2
" although a 5 - year - old boy in the small village of @entity98 , @entity4 , is said to be " patient zero , " with the earliest confirmed case of 2009 @entity23 , no one knows exactly how he contracted the virus			2
read more about the boy some say that tracking the origin of the virus is n't as important as finding ecological weak points and bolstering surveillance			1
" we may not be able to say precisely say , ' this pig farm spawned this virus ' and all that , but i think it 's very important to face the facts about what kinds of ecological settings are spawning danger , " said @entity107 , senior fellow for global health at the @entity109			1
for influenza , the new ecological stress points mostly relate to industrial - scale livestock and , in the case of avian flu , backyard chicken farming , she said			1
in both of those cases , there are " economic lives at stake " in making decisions such as killing certain animals , she said			0
" we have to figure out a way we can surveil those populations , surveil that ecology , without the industries at stake -- or , in the case of chickens , the small family farmer in @entity140 -- feeling that their livelihood is challenged just by the very fact that anybody 's even trying to do surveillance , " @entity130 said			1
but the genetic lineage of the virus does offer useful clues , she said			0
cooperation among the @entity28 , @entity150 and @entity4 in every step of the investigation has been profound , she said			0
by contrast , @entity140 has refused to share bird flu samples with the @entity155 in the past			2
some researchers say it 's not surprising that a new virus such as 2009 @entity23 would seem to have its focal point in @entity4			1
a 2008 nature study co-written by @entity162 , president of @entity163 , an international organization of scientists , used computer modeling to find that hot spots for emerging infectious diseases include @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity4 , parts of @entity171 , @entity172 and the @entity28			1
the study showed that socioeconomic , environmental and ecological factors correlate with emerging infectious diseases and help identify " hot spots " for where they crop up			1
now , researchers are looking at travel and trade patterns from @entity4 to shed light on how the virus has spread			0
there 's a large trade of pigs from the @entity28 and @entity150 , as well as pig trades from other countries , each year into @entity4 , he said			2
" there 's a lot of mixing , and a lot of potential for viruses , " @entity162 said			2
" it 's equally likely that it emerged in @entity4 as it is in @entity150 and the @entity28 " the main driving factors for an emerging infectious disease are the demographics of people , livestock production and changing food production strategies , @entity162 said			1
although scientists know of several thousand viruses , more than a million viruses could be out there , assuming every vertebrate species on the planet has 20 viruses that no other vertebrate has , and there are 50,000 vertebrates , he said			0
the lesson from the swine flu outbreak is that " we missed the boat , " he said			1
while resources were thrown at avian flu in @entity169 , the newest virus has emerged at the @entity28 ' doorstep , he said			2
" we should have been out there looking for these things happening , " he said			0
" we should have been working better with those pig farms or with in any industry in a hot zone			0
" anyone who is building pig farms or poultry farms in a hot zone of emerging infectious diseases should increase security , look out for new diseases in livestock or people , and investigate any novel diseases rigorously , he said			1
the @entity14 has found that each gene segment of 2009 @entity23 had its closest ancestor in swine influenza virus , and officials hypothesized that the reassortment of these genes occurred in pigs , said @entity243 , director of the @entity14 's @entity244			1
" it does n't necessarily mean that that 's where it occurred , but that was our working hypothesis based on the genetic relationship of each of the gene segments , " she said			0
regardless of the outcome of 2009 @entity23 , more infectious diseases will crop up over time , and there 's no end in sight , @entity162 said			2
" when you 're in a genetic arms race like this , we 're always going to be fighting this battle , " he said .			0

one of swine flu 's relatives was isolated in @entity34 in 1998
expert : industrial - scale livestock production is an ecological stress point
researcher : better surveillance needed in hot zones of emerging diseases
