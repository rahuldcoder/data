-- @entity1 did n't know which way his life would turn			1
the @entity4 had auditioned him for one part in their new movie , but they decided to go a different direction			2
then they had another part in mind , or perhaps a third			2
@entity1 was left with uncertainty , adrift amid forces he could n't control			1
it 's sort of the predicament faced by his character in the @entity18 ' film " a serious man , " which was released on video tuesday			1
physics professor @entity21 is a job - like man who is being victimized by an unseen hand , or perhaps sheer random bad luck			1
his wife wants a divorce so she can marry an acquaintance ; his son , preparing for his bar mitzvah ceremony , is escaping into marijuana and the @entity35 's " @entity34 ; " his daughter is a shrill teenager			2
an unknown critic threatens his tenure , a grumbling student threatens his ethics and the @entity41 is threatening his credit			2
( in the film 's one notable anachronism , the club demands payment for two albums that were n't released until 1970			0
) the film , which begins with a quotation the @entity18 attribute to the @entity52 sage @entity53 -- " receive with simplicity everything that happens to you " -- uses @entity56 's rather mundane , if mixed - up , life to take on some challenging themes , including the presence of @entity60 , the fickleness of fate and the need for humility			1
these are intertwined with science , math and comedy			1
( it was made by the @entity18 , after all			0
) the film and @entity1 have been widely praised			1
@entity1 was nominated for a @entity71 as best comedic actor , and " a serious man " -- which was named to dozens of year - end top 10 lists -- is up for two @entity73 , including best picture			1
@entity0 spoke with @entity1 , who 's been primarily known as a stage and television actor , in a phone interview			1
the following is an edited version of the interview			0
@entity0 : congratulations on the best picture nomination			0
how did you get the role ? @entity1 : originally @entity88 and @entity4 brought me in to audition for the part of @entity91 , the husband in the @entity94 parable in the beginning of the story			1
i had to go to a @entity94 tutor [ to ] learn the scene in @entity94 , which was fun			0
i had very little experience with that			0
i did the scene ... and then they were n't sure at that point whether or not they wanted to hire someone who could speak @entity94 fluently or an actor to just do it phonetically			1
they ended up going with folks who could speak it fluently			0
and then maybe about five months passed by , and they called me back to audition for the parts of @entity114 and for @entity115			0
and so i learned a couple scenes of each of those characters , and i read for [ the @entity18 ] and they laughed and that was really wonderful			0
and then i kept inquiring periodically afterward as to whether i was still in the running , and i kept hearing yes , i was still in the running , still in the running			0
and eventually i got a call saying i was going to get one of those parts , but they just did n't know which one yet			0
so i started working on both of them , and about six or seven weeks before the principal photography began , i got a call from @entity88 saying , " we 'll put you out of your misery ; you 're playing @entity114			1
" @entity0 : this is the blackest of black comedies			2
did you find the script thrilling or depressing when you first read it ? @entity1 : i laughed a lot , actually			1
frankly , i thought it was high comedy			2
i found myself giggling throughout the entire thing			2
maybe it 's how specific [ the @entity18 ] are in the rhythms in which they write , or the background i was familiar with -- in being raised in the @entity52 religion -- but it tickled me			0
@entity0 : were you concerned when you saw the script , that this might be a little too @entity52 , a little too esoteric ? or when you get a script from the @entity4 , do you say i 'm in , regardless ? @entity1 : absolutely -- i 'm in , regardless ! if they want to use me , i 'll do anything they want			1
i thought it was a hysterical screenplay , so beautifully constructed and written			0
and i thought it was also a universal story as well			0
we 're all familiar with those times when things go wrong in our lives , and we do the best we can to try to sort them out			2
@entity0 : how does working with the @entity18 compare to your other film experiences ? @entity1 : well , @entity88 and @entity4 have been working with a lot of the same folks almost as far back as [ 1984 's ] " @entity165			1
" so it 's like joining a little repertory company of people who have been together for years			0
they have their own vocabulary , and the set is a well - oiled machine			2
so showing up there , there 's very little that you have to concern yourself with other than doing your job			2
@entity0 : have you been approached by rabbis , by clerics , by physics professors about the film ? @entity1 : not so much			1
i actually sought out the help of a physics professor while i was doing my research before we started shooting			1
that was a big concern of mine			0
i wanted to feel secure enough to get up in front of a group of people and be able to clarify any questions that might come up discussing @entity193 's paradox or the uncertainty principle			0
but i have n't spoken to many clergy			0
i 've read some things that people have written on the film , but i 've been somewhat removed from the reactions			0
@entity0 : what 's up next for you ? @entity1 : at the moment , i 'm filming a new @entity204 series , " @entity205			1
" ( @entity1 plays organized crime boss @entity206			1
) it 's going very well			0
it 's a tremendous cast of actors and a wonderful group of writers , and a tremendous pedigree with mr. [ @entity215 ] @entity214 executive producing , and he directed the pilot			0
@entity0 : did " a serious man " have any effect on you in terms of reconnecting you to @entity220 or thinking about the big questions in life ? @entity1 : hmm			1
( long pause ) i was pretty much able to leave the character at the door when i came home			2
... but i found that the little quote at the beginning of the movie -- " receive with simplicity everything that happens to you " -- i 've taken that away with me as a kind of beautiful watchword of how i live my own life , to try to receive the difficulties of whatever it is that comes into your life with simplicity			1
and that 's a blessing .			0

@entity1 got lead role in @entity249 ' " a serious man " after some delay
