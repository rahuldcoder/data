the @entity0 voted thursday for the public release of key parts of a report on the notorious @entity5 detention and interrogation program launched after the 9/11 terrorist attacks			1
a final decision on declassifying the information now rests with the @entity10 , and it was unclear how long such a process would take			2
@entity14 sen. @entity13 of @entity15 said the panel she leads voted 11 - 3 in a closed - door session to declassify the 480 - page executive summary and 20 findings and conclusions of the five - year study			1
@entity13 called the report 's findings " shocking , " saying it " exposes brutality that stands in stark contrast to our values as a nation			0
" " a stain on our history " " it chronicles a stain on our history that must never again be allowed to happen , " she said			0
" this is not what @entity37 do			0
" the committee 's ranking @entity39 , sen. @entity41 of @entity42 , said he voted to declassify the information in order to move past the politically volatile issue from the @entity39 administration of former president @entity47			2
" this is a chapter in our past that should have already been closed , " he said			0
two other republicans on the panel -- sens. @entity55 of @entity56 and @entity57 of @entity58 -- said they voted against declassification of the report they labeled as " one - sided " and " partisan , " adding the public release of the information would fail to end the debate			1
critics of the @entity5 detention and interrogation program , including president @entity68 , have called the use of controversial techniques including waterboarding a violation of laws prohibiting torture			2
@entity68 banned the practices when he took office in 2009 , after the @entity5 had already stopped using them			2
defenders say the program started in response to the terror attacks yielded valuable intelligence that led to major victories in the fight against @entity84 , including the operation that killed @entity86			0
@entity13 said her panel also was sending the full 6,200 - page report to the @entity10 for possible declassification sometime in the future			1
usually one of the @entity5 's staunchest backers , @entity13 has recently lashed out at the agency in a dispute over the committee staff 's preparation of the report , which has been complete since 2012			2
the @entity5 has asked the @entity98 to investigate whether @entity0 staffers violated the law by accessing classified internal information based on the same documents the agency turned over to the @entity0 for its review			1
spying dispute @entity13 accused the @entity5 of snooping on computers used by the @entity0 staffers , which were in a @entity5 facility designated for the committee 's use			1
her statement thursday detailed harsh criticism of the @entity5 in the report , which said " points to major problems with @entity5 's management of this program and its interactions with the @entity10 , other parts of the executive branch and @entity120			1
" " the release of this summary and conclusions in the near future shows that this nation admits its errors , as painful as they may be , and seeks to learn from them , " @entity13 said			0
" it is now abundantly clear that , in an effort to prevent further terrorist attacks after 9/11 and bring those responsible to justice , the @entity5 made serious mistakes that haunt us to this day			2
" in a @entity0 floor speech last month , @entity13 outlined part of the reason to make the report public			2
@entity139 looks into dispute between @entity5 , @entity0 " the interrogations and the conditions of confinement at the @entity5 detention sites were far different and far more harsh than the way the @entity5 had described them to us , " she said then			1
current and former officials familiar with the findings say it portrays efforts by @entity5 officials to burnish internal reports of how effective the program was , even when it was clear that was n't the case			0
the tactics used were approved by legal memos from the @entity98 's @entity159 , though several of the memos were later withdrawn as erroneous			0
the @entity98 reviewed the conduct of some employees and contractors involved in the program , which the officials say showed excesses beyond those approved by the @entity98 , but declined to bring criminal prosecutions			0
@entity120 misled ? one of those expected to come under criticism in the @entity0 report is @entity172 , who was acting general counsel at the agency during the post- 9/11 period			1
@entity172 , who recently published his memoir " @entity177 : thirty years of @entity181 in the @entity5 , " supports declassifying and releasing the @entity0 report and the @entity5 's rebuttal " and let people judge			1
" he disputes the idea that he or any other officials misled @entity120 , something he said he would have told congressional investigators if they asked for an interview			0
" i believed the program yielded valuable intelligence and i continue to believe this			0
now , could it have been gotten through other ways ? i do n't know ; that is unknowable , " @entity172 said in an interview			0
a dozen years later , he added , it was important to recall that @entity5 employees did the best they could in facing the threat at the time			0
the program began when @entity120 and then - president @entity47 were pushing the @entity5 and other security agencies to do everything to prevent another attack , which at the time was believed to be very likely			1
the @entity5 in the past has disputed some of the findings of the @entity0 committee report			1
@entity209 , a @entity5 spokesman , refrained from commenting on the report , saying the agency had yet to receive a final copy			1
last month , @entity68 said he supported the declassification of the committee 's report " so that the @entity37 people can understand what happened in the past and that can help guide us as we move forward			0
" what are the @entity5 and @entity0 fighting about ?			1

the panel voted 11 - 3 for declassification of some of the report
@entity0 report covers @entity5 interrogation programs during the @entity47 era
@entity231 will submit entire report to the @entity10 , which has final say on declassification
this is the report that *triggered* *allegations* of @entity5 spying on the @entity0
