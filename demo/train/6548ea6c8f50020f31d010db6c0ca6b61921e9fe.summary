@entity0 -- former @entity3 governor and @entity5 presidential candidate @entity4 dodged questions again on whether he 'd consider mounting a third bid for the @entity8 in an interview monday , singling out another former governor instead			1
" if you look at ( the 2016 @entity5 field ) and see no @entity13 , no @entity14 , no one who you think can raise the money and compete against the @entity17 nominee then you 'll think about it ? " @entity19 , co-host of @entity20 's " with @entity22 , " asked @entity4 in an interview monday night			1
" i think @entity13 is an excellent person , could be a terrific president , " @entity4 said , predicting a wide field of " 15 or so people on the stage at the first debate			1
" " i 'm not running , i 'm not planning on running , and i got nothing new on that story , " he said			0
@entity4 shifts spotlight to @entity30 while viewers did n't learn anything new about @entity4 's plans , they did get another peek into @entity4 's personal side -- which has emerged more and more from the guarded image of @entity4 that voters were exposed to two years ago			1
in an evolution from his stiff , buttoned - up demeanor that was often lampooned during his previous @entity8 runs , @entity4 dished in the interview on his favorite television show , his grandchildren and even a leg massage			1
on " @entity48 " : " i think the show was most enjoyable in the first season			0
then when @entity50 ( @entity51 ) went off to war , it was a bit of a departure for a few seasons , " @entity4 said , straight - faced			2
" i actually like the downstairs part more than the upstairs part , even though i think @entity58 ( @entity51 ) is an absolutely delightful character and i love watching her			0
" " are we really talking about ' @entity48 ' ? " he said , laughing			0
@entity4 's wife , @entity61 , spoke previously about her family 's penchant for the @entity65 drama in july 2012 , prompting @entity19 's question			2
sizing up a @entity68 - @entity4 race on the downfalls of glad - handing on the campaign trail : " i shook so many hands at a couple of events that i began to get a kink in my back and so i asked the guy who traveled with me ... ' can you find someone to get me a back massage at the hotel tonight ? ' " " and she gave me a massage , she was @entity83 , after i left to get changed and showered and so forth , she turned to ( @entity4 's assistant ) and said , ' is he a dancer ? ' that was the best compliment i have ever had			1
" what made her ask ? " the legs , " he said			0
they 're bird legs actually but she thought they were strong			0
" will @entity4 take the plunge again ? on his large family : near the conclusion of the interview , @entity4 was subjected to a memory test when the co-hosts asked him to name each of his grandchildren as a family picture was projected on a large screen in the studio			2
" i know my grandchildren , " he said , before exchanging an awkward fist - bump with the show 's hosts .			0

former candidate @entity4 *insists* a 2016 presidential run is n't in the cards
