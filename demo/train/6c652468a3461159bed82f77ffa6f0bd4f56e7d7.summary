@entity0 , @entity1 -- would n't it be great if you could simply grab carbon dioxide from the air and turn it back into fuel ? according to @entity1 - based renewable energy start - up @entity9 , you can			1
" in fact , the idea has been around since at least the 70s , " says @entity11 , the company 's chief technology officer			2
but the process is expensive			2
" for as long as fossil fuels have been cheap and readily available , there 's not been sufficient demand , " he adds			2
now -- with the world 's finite stock of crude oil on the wane , and amidst pressure to reduce global carbon dioxide ( @entity28 ) emissions -- the idea of converting those very carbons back into what @entity11 calls " synthetic fuels " is becoming more financially viable			1
" the combustion of synthetic fuel does not increase the amount of @entity36 in the atmosphere , " he explains			2
" this is because the carbon is being continuously recycled			2
" synthetic fuel can come in the form of everything from diesel to gasoline to wax			2
but while the process is simple in theory ( see factbox ) , it is unwieldy in practice -- demanding ultra-high temperatures which gobble up electricity			1
" the operation is only practical now that we have relatively cheap sources of renewable electricity to power it , " says @entity11			1
using conventional electricity was never an option , he adds , after all " what 's the point of turning carbon into fuel if the electricity you 're using to do it burns up more carbon than you started with ? " but this highlights an uncomfortable fact : @entity9 's synthetic fuel contains only 70 % of the energy that goes into making it , as heat is lost during the process			1
so , why waste hard - won green electricity to produce old - fashioned petrol ? dr. @entity78 is head of the @entity80 's @entity79 ( @entity79 )			0
he says that , while all efforts should be made to reduce our dependence on liquid fuels , it may not be possible for some industries : " the thing with fuel is that it offers very high density energy storage ... for areas like long haul aviation , it 's hard to see what could replace it			1
" according to the @entity96 , global oil consumption is currently about 30 billion barrels a year			0
@entity78 points out that , even if we reduce our thirst for fossil fuels to just one or two percent of this figure over the next century , we may still need millions of barrels for things like commercial flight that are unable to use electricity for power			1
could synthetic fuel really plug that gap ? at present , @entity9 is moving out of the lab and is talking to car and aircraft - makers in the hope of increasing fuel production to an industrial scale			1
they are aiming for production to hit one barrel a day within the next few years			0
if that does n't sound like a lot , that 's because it 's not			0
" this is going to be a long process , " admits @entity11			1
" i 'd estimate that it will take between one to two decades before we can replace a single digit percent of current demand ( for fuel )			0
" the problem , he says , is developing materials that can resist extraordinarily high temperatures for long periods of time without degrading			1
" but we 'll do it , " insists @entity11			0
" many innovations in the past century , like the car or the computer , have had to overcome seemingly impossible thermodynamic obstacles			0
" @entity139 engineer @entity138 is certainly hoping that companies like @entity9 will be successful in the long run			0
he is chief operating officer of @entity142 , a firm that specializes in capturing carbon from the air			1
" the question is , what do we do with the carbon once we 've got it ? " he asks			0
" at present , the main markets are quite niche -- things like carbonated fizzy drinks , computer cooling systems and industrial greenhouses			0
" it 's no surprise then that @entity138 and his team have been working with @entity9 to flesh out the logistics of a future partnership			0
the potential market , he says , is a huge and " much more profitable than storing the carbon underground , that 's for sure			0

@entity1 company created process to turn carbon dioxide from air into liquid fuel
theory has been around since *1970s* , but implementation too *costly* until now
process requires ultra-high temperatures , industrial production a long way off
technique could also be used to store electricity captured from wind , solar power
