-- if you happen to browse upon a news story that 's too odd to be true wednesday , hold your outrage and check the calendar			1
a @entity6 newspaper ran a caricature last year of two opposition leaders hugging in light of @entity10			2
it 's @entity10 -- when media outlets around the world take a break from the serious business of delivering news and play fast and furious with the facts			1
no one quite knows when the practice began , but any journalist will point to what is undoubtedly the biggest hoax that any reputable news establishment ever pulled : a 1957 @entity27 report that said , thanks to a mild winter and the elimination of the spaghetti weevil , @entity25 farmers were enjoying a bumper spaghetti crop			1
the segment was accompanied by pictures of farmers pulling strands of spaghetti from trees -- and prompted hundreds of viewers to call in , wanting to know how they could grow their own spaghetti trees			1
while not as elaborate , the pranks that media outlets harvested this year have been quite rich : the @entity43 in @entity44 ran a story wednesday announcing that , after 188 years as a print publication , it will become the first newspaper to deliver news exclusively via @entity49			1
@entity49 , a micro-blogging site , allows users to post updates that are 140 characters long			1
in keeping with the limitation , the newspaper said it had undertaken a mammoth project to retool the newspaper 's entire archive			2
for example , @entity60 's 1927 flight from @entity61 to @entity62 , @entity63 , was condensed to : " @entity65 first successful transatlantic air flight wow , pretty cool ! boring day otherwise ... sigh			2
" the news is n't always black and white			1
the @entity68 , one of three @entity71 - language dailies in @entity72 , fooled many readers with a report that two pandas donated by @entity76 to the @entity77 were , in fact , brown forest bears dyed black and white			1
to render a whiff of authenticity to the story , editors made a reference to @entity76 's tainted - milk scandal that sickened 300,000 people last year			2
but the story contained enough outrageous lines to clue in readers			1
among them , a quote from a souvenir stand operator who worried the panda deception would affect sales of her " stuffed panda toys , panda t - shirts , panda pens and notepads , remote - controlled pandas on wheels , caps with panda ears on top , panda fans , panda flashlights , panda mugs , panda eyeglass cases , panda face masks , panda slippers , panda wallet and panda purses			2
" sometimes , of course , the pranks backfire			2
in @entity118 , the @entity117 newspaper drew hundreds of angry comments wednesday after a story on its web site said a @entity76 construction firm wanted to buy naming rights to the iconic @entity124			0
many readers did not realize the story was a hoax -- despite a quote from a spokeswoman named april @entity130			1
ireport.com : share your best april fools ' office pranks and jokes @entity135 , the head of the journalism department at @entity44 's @entity137 , said such pranks do not particularly affect the credibility of a news organization			1
" they are done in a way that you know it 's a joke , " he said			0
" in the @entity43 story , for example , the clue is in the name of the journalist [ @entity149 ] -- which is an anagram for @entity151			1
people look out for them really , and therefore , you kind of open the paper trying to spot the spoof story			0
" of course , news outlets are n't the only ones who hoodwink readers on april 1			1
the town of @entity161 , a popular tourist stop in @entity163 , said a rotten egg smell that permeates the town is such an aphrodisiac that @entity168 founder @entity167 wants to build a mansion there			0
@entity171 said it is releasing a new @entity173 video game , " @entity174 , " which will do for fans of yodeling what " @entity179 " did for rock music			0
and car manufacturer @entity180 announced in ads in @entity183 newspapers that it had developed " @entity184			0
" " @entity186 is an ingenious new system that locks on to the car in front via an enhanced magnetic beam , " the ad said			0
" once your @entity180 is attached you are free to release your foot from the accelerator and turn off your engine			0
" @entity195 , features editor of the @entity68 , said such hoaxes are not only good for a laugh but serve a purpose			1
" it highlights an important aspect of media that readers and viewers should keep a critical mind when they read stories or watch tv , " he said			1
" i think that is especially true with the advent of the @entity210 and the proliferation of blogging			0
" the origins of pulling pranks on @entity10 is unclear			0
some believe it dates back to the time when the gregorian calendar was first adopted , changing the beginning of the year to january 1 from april 1			1
those who still held on to the @entity220 were referred to as " april fools			2
" traditionally , the pranks are pulled before noon on this day			0
but a wildly successful prank this year was conceived and executed much earlier			0
millions of web users fell for a video that claimed to be the first flying five - star hotel in a converted @entity227 - era helicopter			0
the 37 - second clip , which was posted online thursday , was an elaborate computer - generated hoax by the airport hotel chain @entity230			2
if you were one of the many who fell for the prank , hold your disappointment			0
you can still reserve rooms on the moon through @entity238 or book flights to @entity240 through @entity241 for $ 99			0
the offers end wednesday .			0

if a news item seems especially outrageous on april 1 , it just may be a hoax
among the good ones already : the @entity43 reportedly *switches* to @entity49 format
@entity68 editor says , " readers and viewers should keep a critical mind "
