@entity1 , @entity0 -- garbage dumps are generally not associated with thriving coral reefs , vast mangrove plantations and rare bird species			2
yet on @entity8 off @entity9 , this is exactly what you will find : just beside a secluded ecological zone that harbors dozens of rare plant , bird and fish species lies the world 's first ecological offshore landfill			1
located 8 kilometers south of @entity9 and covering an area of 3.5 square kilometers , the @entity8 was designed by engineers and environmentalists at @entity9 's @entity21 ( @entity21 )			1
it consists of two small islands that have been connected by a rock embankment			0
the area inside the landfill is divided into 11 bays , known as ' cells ' , which are lined with thick plastic and clay to prevent any harmful material from seeping into the sea			2
since the landfill was put into use in 1999 , four of the 11 cells have been filled , covered with earth and planted with grass			2
the landfill , which cost around $ 400 million , can hold up to 63 million cubic meters of rubbish , enough to satisfy @entity9 's waste disposal needs until 2040			1
@entity41 and odor - free what distinguishes @entity43 from other landfills is that it is clean and free of smell			2
two thirds of the material that comes to @entity43 has passed through one of the city 's four incinerators , reducing it to approximately ten percent of its original volume			2
waste from construction material is also processed , while toxic waste like asbestos is packaged in such a way that it can not leak into the surrounding environment			0
two mangrove groves that were destroyed when the embankment was built have been replanted near the landfill and today they serve as biological indicators for the local environment			1
if they were to start dying , it would be seen as a sign that harmful material had leaked from the landfill			0
scientists expected that some of the mangroves would not survive the relocation , but today they cover 1.4 square kilometers around the island and even have to be cut back in places -- a sign that the landfill is indeed leak - proof			1
flourishing wildlife together with the island 's other ecosystems such as seagrass meadows , coral reefs and sandy shores , the mangroves serve as a habitat for a variety of birds , fish and plants			1
the decision to build a landfill off @entity43 was taken in the 1990 's when the previous landfill on the main island had nearly reached capacity			1
" as land is scarce in @entity9 , it was decided from the outset that the new sanitary landfill in the smaller islands would be designed as an environmentally friendly facility which would be used to meet @entity9 's land use needs when it was eventually filled up and closed , " the @entity21 explained in an official statement			1
every effort was made to minimize the impact on the local environment so that the area beside the landfill , which always had a rich flora and fauna , has remained intact			0
" great effort went into making sure that the impact of the landfill on @entity8 's biodiversity was minimized			2
in fact , biodiversity remains high and we have not lost a single species because of the landfill , " says @entity116 , an education and research officer at the @entity119 ( @entity119 ) in @entity9			1
new species she adds that as the island 's various ecosystems continue to flourish , scientists are still discovering new species on @entity43			1
in july 2005 , the government decided to open the western part of @entity43 up to the public for recreational purposes			0
today there are guided nature walks along the island 's coast , while sports fishing and bird watching associations also organize special excursions to the island			1
" when we do the tours around the island , we have a powerful message , " says @entity144 , an associate at the @entity119 and owner of a popular web site , wildsingapore.com			0
" we tell people : ' look how beautiful this is , and imagine what could be destroyed if the landfill had to be expanded			0
' this makes them think and when they go home they are more careful about how they deal with waste			0
" @entity161 biodiversity thus , the @entity8 project has inadvertently turned into more than just a trash dump ; it is becoming an educational project and could serve as a model for sustainable urban development around the world			0
" the rich biodiversity around the sanitary landfill shows that development and environmental protection can co-exist and need not be mutually exclusive , " says the @entity21			0
" it is of course a compromise , but in the context of urban living i think it is a good one			0
some nature lovers criticize the project , but in the end we have to throw our rubbish somewhere and this is a good solution , " says @entity179			0
" i see @entity8 as a great way of striking a balance between the need of urban development and nature conservation			0
" ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... are ecological landfill islands a viable solution for our waste ? would you live on a landscaped landfill ? share your stories and read what others have to say in the forum .			1

@entity9 has built the world 's first ecological landfill island
birds , fish and plants have *flocked* to the island 's mangroves
the island hosts nature walks , fishing and bird - watching excursions
the landfill will eventually be used to meet @entity9 's land use needs
