-- the achilles heel of @entity3 's policy against terrorism is its failure to counter the narratives that inspire individuals to become extremists and terrorists			1
that 's why -- despite the skill and numerous successes of our military , intelligence and law enforcement agencies -- the type of tragic events seen most recently with the stabbings of soldiers in @entity21 and outside @entity22 , and the april bombing of the @entity24 , will continue to occur			1
we 're failing to use a key weapon that needs to be used			2
there 's no question that the @entity3 has been extremely effective tactically against @entity28 and other terrorist groups since 9/11			1
our military , intelligence and law enforcement agencies have done what they were charged with doing , from routing them in @entity33 to hunting down @entity34 to thwarting plots against @entity36			2
but this is n't enough			2
for as long as extremists are able to attract new recruits , they 'll keep producing replacements for those killed or apprehended and the battle will never end			2
this is why the strategic tool known as " countering violent extremism , " or @entity47 , has to be used alongside special operations , drones and other weapons			0
as an @entity53 special agent , i interrogated dozens of senior terrorists			1
it quickly became clear that part of @entity28 's effectiveness in gaining recruits was in their tailoring their rhetoric and their messenger to the personality , location and likely local grievances of their target			1
extremists wo n't use a @entity69 railing about @entity3 " crimes " in @entity71 to try to appeal to @entity3 - @entity73 youths in @entity74			1
they 'll find someone with as close a background as possible , and who understands grievances that resonate , such as foreign powers intervening in @entity73 's affairs			0
once a person is recruited they are indoctrinated with the group 's counterculture			0
asymmetrical groups like @entity28 often develop their own countercultures , with certain religious texts , events and a consciousness that allows them to in many ways create their own religion within @entity93			1
it is n't an ideology			0
that 's factually inaccurate and gives it undeserved credit			0
it 's a false narrative			0
as i travel around the world today , i 've seen how that counterculture , once centered in @entity33 and @entity103 , has worryingly spread to places like @entity105 and @entity106			0
its spread is helped by today 's new technological tools : recruitment is not just happening in training camps and in secret meeting rooms , but in internet chat rooms and through social media			1
that has been a major factor in the increase in homegrown terrorism in the @entity119 , seen horrifically on may 22 on the streets of @entity21 and april 15 at the @entity24			0
in his recent speech on terrorism , president @entity121 told the nation that the values the @entity3 holds will ultimately defeat the terrorists			1
this will be the case as long as we take the steps to effectively deploy our message			0
we need to counter extremists in the same manner that they recruit : targeting extremists with the ideal medium , messenger and message			1
a mistake the @entity3 has been making to date is in repeatedly making broad gestures toward the @entity141 world and the @entity3 @entity141 community , making the argument that the @entity3 is a friend			1
these broad messages do n't have an impact on those who need to be targeted			0
the @entity3 is working on developing a @entity47 program , but it has mistakenly spread the domestic portfolio across a range of agencies , from the @entity152 to the @entity53			1
this makes it difficult to have a clear and effective strategy , and also hampers efforts : charging law enforcement with both collecting intelligence on suspected extremists as well as handling community engagement programs creates natural conflicts and means that neither job can be done effectively			1
the ideal situation is one in which the federal government provides support to local efforts to deal with local extremists and recruitment factors , not by imposing a strategy dictated from @entity171			0
this requires local communities -- whether in @entity36 or in @entity174 , @entity69 -- to step up and take the lead in increasing the resiliency of their communities against these groups by identifying what the extremist narratives are and where they 're spreading -- and then by countering them			2
when people are being recruited because of alleged local or tribal grievances , it is community leaders who are the best messengers to counter that narrative			2
when it 's a distortion of @entity93 , it 's the duty of religious leaders to take the lead			0
sometimes it 's former extremists , who have taken the same path and have credibility , who can be the most effective messengers			2
the best cve programs , such as @entity199 's , do this			0
they have a focused aim of reducing the pool of potential recruits and the appeal of violence , and they target accordingly			0
when done correctly , @entity47 should not be an excuse for broad social work or for anthropological studies ; it 's a focused counterterrorism weapon			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity214 .			1

@entity3 has been effective tactically *vs.* @entity28 , since 9/11 , says @entity214
he says tragic events such as the @entity220 bombing keep happening
