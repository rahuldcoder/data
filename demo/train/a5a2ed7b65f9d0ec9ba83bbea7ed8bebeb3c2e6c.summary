-- nothing tempts hackers quite like a high - profile new target			2
a website is offering a bounty of more than $ 16,000 in cash and other prizes for the first person to successfully hack the @entity10 fingerprint sensor on the new @entity11			1
the site , @entity13 , was created by @entity14 , an independent computer - security researcher known for demonstrating hacks of smartphones , and @entity18 , owner of @entity19 , a cybersecurity firm			0
it invites donors to contribute to the bounty , which so far includes an assortment of cash , bitcoins ( a form of digital currency ) , several bottles of booze and " a dirty sex book			1
" a successful hack of the phone had not been verified as of monday morning , although a @entity33 hackers ' group claimed over the weekend to have bypassed the biometric security of the @entity11 by photographing a fingerprint left on a glass surface and using the image to create a fake finger to unlock the phone			1
they demonstrated their exploits in this video			0
" we hope that this finally puts to rest the illusions people have about fingerprint biometrics			0
it is plain stupid to use something that you canÂ ´ t change and that you leave everywhere every day as a security token , " said @entity48 , a spokesperson for the group , the @entity49 , in a post online			0
how secure is your @entity11 fingerprint ? according to terms @entity14 posted on @entity58 , to collect the bounty a hacker must lift a fingerprint from the phone or elsewhere and reproduce it in such a way that will allow them to unlock an @entity11 in less than five tries			1
all the steps must be documented on video			0
" the whole point of # istouchidhackedyet was to put up or shut up with regards to criticisms of @entity73 's @entity10 security and implementation , " @entity14 said saturday on @entity58			1
" i personally believe ( for once ) a company has implemented a unique feature ( @entity10 ) in a reasonably secure way , " he added in another tweet			1
@entity14 tweeted sunday that he had been in contact with the @entity49 and was " waiting on a complete video documentation of the process ( of their hack ) before declaring valid			0
" the @entity11 , which went on sale friday , has a fingerprint sensor in its home button for added security			1
@entity73 calls the new security system @entity10			2
phone owners must " register " their print with the device , after which they can unlock the phone by placing a finger or thumb on the button			2
other users ' fingerprints will not unlock the phone , which protects it from thieves			2
the @entity10 system is meant for human fingerprints , of course , but it apparently works with animals , too			2
a @entity106 man posted a video friday to @entity108 that showed him using the paw of his pet @entity111 to unlock his new @entity11			1
@entity14 and @entity18 are so - called " white hat " hackers who investigate and expose security holes that have yet to be plugged by makers of new computer systems			0
tech companies generally appreciate being alerted to such security issues , which they can then patch before users ' personal information is compromised			0
@entity73 did not immediately respond to a request from @entity0 for comment .			0
