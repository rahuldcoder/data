-- for first - timers in a @entity3 bathhouse , stripping naked and soaking for hours in tubs with strangers often comes as a jolt			1
the scrub corner in any jjimjilbang ( @entity3 bathhouse / sauna / spa / adult playground ) is the section newbies find most alarming			1
this is because the scrub corner traffics in a completely different kind of naked intimacy -- one in which a grumpy @entity3 woman in black lace underwear uses a coarse towel to scrub every corner of her guest / victim 's body			1
for most , it 's a punishing , yet oddly satisfying experience			0
it lasts about 40 minutes -- or a few minutes longer than you 'd find yourself in the ring for a championship prizefight			1
good @entity3 scrub the intense @entity3 cleansing process ( called " seshin " ) entails soaking the body in hot water , then rubbing it with a " @entity33 towel " -- a colorful , thin loofah with a sandpaper - like texture -- to rid the body of all the gunk , dirt and layers of dead skin that accumulate naturally			1
rolls of dark , gray skin fall away as the @entity43 ( scrub mistress ) works away , revealing soft , pink layers of skin underneath			2
it 's an extraordinarily rejuvenating -- and , again , painful -- process that locals embrace as a weekly ritual with family and friends			1
men and women have separate bathing areas and get scrubbed by members of their own gender			2
gaining traction @entity3 scrubbing rituals have typically been embraced by few @entity59 -- assorted @entity61 stars have gone in for quick sessions in @entity64 's @entity63			1
otherwise , the technique is largely unknown			0
over the past year or so , however , according to @entity71 's @entity70 head of public relations @entity72 , the number of foreigners coming for scrubs is increasing			2
" we 've been noticing tourists coming to @entity78 and staying two nights at a hotel , and one night here , at the spa , " says @entity72 , explaining that many foreign visitors opt for package deals that included a seshin option			0
" a lot of tourists come to @entity78 and come here first , with their luggage , and get scrubbed to start their visit , " he says			2
is the @entity3 - style scrub on its way to becoming the next global beauty trend ? if it is , we want to be among the first to check it out			1
that 's why we went to @entity71 to ask the best scrub mistresses for tips on getting the most out of a scrub session			0
do n't touch the shower gel while many bring their own fancy shower gel to the bathhouse to lather up before the scrub , it turns out that bar soap , not the liquid kind , is actually the way to go			0
" use the soap provided by the bathhouses during the pre-scrub shower and soak , " says @entity106 , who 's been a scrub mistress at the @entity70 in @entity108 , @entity71 , for more than a decade			0
" if you use body shampoo , the skin gets too slippery to scrub properly , and the ' dde ' ( dead skin rolls ) does n't come off nearly as well			1
soak for 30 minutes in medium - hot water impatient scrubees bolt out of soaking tubs after five or 10 minutes			0
@entity3 grandmothers stay in tubs seemingly for hours			1
but the optimal length for a pre-scrub soak is 30 minutes			0
soaking in hotter water causes the skin to wrinkle faster ( a good thing ) , but according to a gaggle of @entity43 ( scrub mistress ) at @entity129 in @entity130 , customers should stay in the water temperature they 're most comfortable with , instead of attempting a hotter tub and calling it a day after a few minutes			1
" staying in the water to prune is most important , " says one ddemiri			0
be completely bare this one may seem obvious , but scrub mistresses say many of their customers come to them without removing everything			0
this includes rings , earrings , glasses and other accessories			0
those with long hair should bring their own hair - tie -- the ddemiri will tie their hair in a perfect bun			2
seriously , relax " relax ! " is the instruction issued most often by the ddemiri			0
if the body is too rigid , the scrub mistress ca n't contort it into the positions necessary to get at every nook and cranny			2
it 's awkward and painful at first , but forcing the body to relax its muscles allows the ddemiri to get things done most effectively			1
" usually customers listen and then they end up having a lot of fun , " says @entity160			0
the fun should come afterward this one surprises locals as well as foreigners			2
though some think sitting in a spa 's various hot rooms before a scrub is an effective way to get the skin ready , ddemiris advise getting scrubbed before relaxing			1
" if customers get scrubbed first and then go to the hot rooms , they 'll feel more refreshed , since the sweat is n't blocked by dirty pores , " says @entity160			2
" then all they have to do after is rinse off in the shower			0
scrub weekly scrubs should be booked once a week			1
any more often , and there 's danger of over-exfoliation			0
but according to @entity160 , weekly scrubs improve skin vibrancy and blood circulation , as well as muscle relaxation			1
