the 29 satellites , the most ever launched at one time , will be aboard a single minotaur i rocket scheduled to lift off from @entity10 's @entity9 in @entity11 at 7:30 p.m. they include the main payload , the @entity5 's @entity14 , and 28 tiny satellites called cubesats			1
the cubesats are aptly named			2
also called nanosatellites , they are small cubes , about 4 inches on each side , weighing about 3 pounds and with a volume of about a quart			1
among the @entity16 is the @entity24 , built by the students of @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity11			1
it will be the first satellite made by high - schoolers to go into space			1
once in orbit , the " @entity24 will allow students and amateur radio users the opportunity to send and receive data from the satellite			1
students and other users from around the world will be able to submit text strings to be uploaded to the @entity24 website , " according to @entity42 , the developer and manufacturer of the minotaur rocket			2
the students have been working on the @entity24 for seven years , according to @entity42			0
