@entity3 the @entity2 administration 's most significant legislative achievement is now , once again , teetering before the @entity5			1
the justices are n't weighing the fate of the entire statute this time			1
in fact , the dispute concerns what @entity11 meant in just four words in one section of the law			1
but the impact could be nearly as dramatic			1
in 2012 , the @entity17 barely survived a constitutional challenge when chief justice @entity19 stunned conservatives and voted along with the court 's four liberal justices to uphold the law			1
health chief : no plan if @entity17 overruled on march 4 , the justices will gather again to hear a challenge to the law , based on the validity of subsidies in the form of tax breaks , that could affect millions of @entity33			1
the health care law provides for the establishment of " exchanges " through which individuals can purchase competitively priced health insurance			1
it also authorizes federal tax credits to low - and middle - income @entity33 to help offset the cost of the policies			1
currently 16 states plus the @entity3 have set up their own exchanges ; the remaining 34 states rely on exchanges run by the federal government			1
those bringing the case say that the words " established by the state " in a subsection of the law make clear that subsidies are only available to those living in the 16 states that set up their own exchanges			1
they say the @entity60 -- one of the agencies charged with implementing the law -- was wrong to offer tax credits to individuals who live in states that only have federally run exchanges			1
in their eyes , the only exchanges that comport with the letter of the law are those established by the states themselves			2
if the court says the @entity60 rule is invalid , absent some kind of action by the states or @entity11 , more than 5 million individuals will no longer be eligible for the subsidies , shaking up the individual market			2
though a ruling against the government would n't nullify the law , it could destabilize it			2
if millions of @entity33 were to lose the tax subsidies , and as a result not buy insurance , it would cause premiums to skyrocket in the individual market because there would be less healthy people in the pool			2
it would then be up to @entity11 to fix the law or states to set up their own exchanges			2
just tuesday , @entity102 secretary @entity101 warned that if the government loses , it has no plan b to " undo the massive damage			2
" the challengers say that @entity11 limited the subsidies in order to encourage the states to set up their own exchanges			2
but when only a few states acted , the @entity60 tried to " fix " the law and wrote a rule allowing subsidies for those living in states with state - run exchanges as well as states with federally run exchanges			2
" if the rule of law means anything , " wrote @entity122 , a lawyer for the challengers , in court briefs , " it is that text is not infinitely malleable and that agencies must follow the law as written -- not revise it to ' better ' achieve what they assume to have been @entity11 's purposes			2
" @entity122 stressed that even though the case is " socially consequential " and " politically sensitive , " the court must look at what precisely the law says			1
" under those principles , it is clear that the @entity60 rule must fall , " he said			0
congressional opponents of the @entity17 such as @entity140 sens. @entity139 and @entity141 agree			1
in a friend - of - the - court brief , they argued that the executive branch improperly encroached on @entity11 ' lawmaking function and that the @entity60 interpretation " opens the door to hundreds of billions of dollars of additional government spending			0
" solicitor general @entity148 said that the language at issue is a " term of art " and that @entity11 always intended the subsidies to be available to everyone			0
@entity148 said it was " abundantly clear " that some states would not establish their own exchanges and that if the challengers win , those living in states with federally facilitated exchanges would " face the very death spirals the @entity159 was structured to avoid			0
" the legislators who actually crafted the law agree with @entity148			0
the challengers ' assertion is " inconsistent with the text and history of the statute , " they argued			0
in addition , 22 states filed a brief saying that if the challengers prevail , insurance markets throughout the country will be disrupted and the law may not be able to operate as a " comprehensive nationwide program			0
" if the challengers win , individuals living in the 34 states that opted not to establish exchanges would face the loss of their subsidies			0
in 2014 , more than 5.3 million @entity33 selected an insurance plan through one of the federally facilitated plans			0
enrollment for 2015 is still in progress , but in court briefs the government said that nearly 7 million customers have selected or been re-enrolled in a plan through a federally facilitated exchange and " coverage throughout the exchanges is expected to continue to increase substantially in the coming years			0
" those living in states with their own exchanges would not be in danger of losing their subsidies as a result of a ruling against the government			0
but if the system is destabilized elsewhere , all bets are off			0
the plaintiffs in the case are residents of @entity207 , one of the 34 states that declined to establish its own exchange			1
@entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 and @entity214 all signed declarations with the @entity5 that they did n't want to purchase @entity17 - compliant health insurance in 2014			1
the crux of their argument is that if it were not for the tax credits for premiums , they could not afford health insurance and thus would be exempt from the individual mandate to purchase health insurance			0
but in order to bring the challenge , the plaintiffs have to show that they have the " standing " or legal right to be in court			0
this means that they have to have been harmed by the government action			0
although the lower courts dismissed the government 's argument that the plaintiffs did n't have standing , the media and others have uncovered information that could raise new questions			0
it turns out , for example , that two of the plaintiffs are veterans and could be eligible for health care through the @entity244 , though they signed a declaration swearing that they were n't eligible for government insurance			0
if they were , they would n't have to buy insurance through the exchange			0
as things stand now , however , the government has not pressed the issue before the @entity5			1
but the justices themselves might be interested in the issue , which could potentially derail the case .			1

@entity17 finds its *future* hinging once again on a @entity5 *decision*
justices will hear arguments in the case on march 4
