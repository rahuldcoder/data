-- jazz fans , as with their counterparts in rock ' n ' roll , tend to be enthralled with the outlaws , renegades and mystics in their artistic realm			1
the further " out " jazz musicians or composers are in their personal lives , goes the myth , the more visionary and transcendent their output			0
who creates great , or even good art by playing it safe ? @entity17 , who died of heart failure wednesday , one day short of his 92nd birthday , was the paradigmatic " good guy " of @entity21 jazz			1
but he was , of course , much more than that			0
he was one of the rare jazz musicians whose name and face were easily recognized by those who do n't know much about jazz			0
the @entity27 , which featured @entity17 on piano and @entity29 on alto saxophone , was one of the iconic jazz ensembles of the 1950s and ' 60s , making its reputation with college campus recitals , playing in festivals and concert halls all over the world and releasing albums that went platinum			1
the group even put out a single , " @entity42 , " that climbed the pop charts , peaking at number 25 in 1961 on @entity46 's @entity45 , rare air for any jazz artist , before and after the @entity49 stormed the @entity51 pop firmament			1
" @entity42 " was one of the few @entity17 hits the leader did n't write himself			1
( @entity29 , who died of lung cancer in 1977 , did			0
) but there were other enduring standards ( " @entity57 , " " three to @entity58 " ) introduced on the 1959 platinum - selling " @entity59 , along with " @entity42			1
" these and other pieces did clever , unexpected things with time - signatures ( " @entity57 " has a 9/8 beat while " @entity42 ' is in 5/4 ) that charmed audiences with their ingenuity while accustoming novices to jazz 's capacity for surprise			1
@entity17 's piano playing was itself something of a rhythmic effect , striding , vamping , riffing with heavy chords and thick intonation			1
@entity29 's wry , airy lyricism provided the counterpoint and some critics preferred his playing to @entity17 's			1
still , not even the most discerning of these skeptics could deny @entity17 's gifts as a composer			1
besides such durable standards as " @entity85 , " " @entity84 " and " @entity86 , " a tribute to his hero @entity88 , @entity17 wrote suites for orchestras , oratorios for choirs and even the occasional theme for a tv series			1
( the lively " theme from ' mr. @entity97 ' " proved more enduring than the one - season wonder it was written for			0
news : @entity100 great @entity17 dies at 91 through it all , he was , by all accounts , gregarious , self - possessed and generous in spirit			2
he was married to the same woman , the former @entity104 , from 1942 to the end of his life			0
he raised six children , four of whom followed their father into the music business , sometimes performing and recording on their own , sometimes with him			0
he and his family spent most of their lives in their @entity113 , @entity114 , home where , despite a global touring schedule that , at one point had him doing 120 consecutive days of concerts in several cities , he always found sufficient time to write music , practice his piano and play with his children			2
in other words : no outlaw or renegade in this corner of the room			0
but @entity17 , as his multitudes of fans ( and more than a few historians ) attest , carried substantial artistic weight of his own while walking the straight - and - narrow			1
if ever there was an exemplar of the " good guy " as visionary artist , it was @entity17 , who leaves behind a radiant legacy of steadfast integrity , an open - hearted ( and open - minded ) worldview and an infectious sense of play that lured listeners at whatever level of musical appreciation into the simple joys of fiddling with time and space			1
this son of a @entity150 , @entity149 , cattle rancher would reap many honors for not heeding his father 's warning , recalled by @entity17 to me in a conversation a few years back , that there was no real life to be found " playing in a smoky nightclub			2
" in 2009 , he was honored for lifetime achievement by the @entity160 , along with such diverse peers as @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165			0
his 90th birthday was commemorated two years ago with a documentary produced by @entity168 , featuring testimonials from sources as varied as president @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174			0
in that documentary , @entity17 recalls not only his years of study under @entity178 composer @entity177 ( along with @entity88 his greatest musical influence ) , but also his service in @entity181 , most of which he spent in @entity183 's @entity182 in @entity184			2
he would have fought at the @entity185 if he had n't been asked to play piano at a @entity188 show			0
he spent the last year - and - a - half of the war leading " @entity190 , " an @entity182 jazz band that was also one of the first racially mixed units in the armed services before the military 's postwar racial integration			0
in @entity198 ' 2000 miniseries , " @entity100 , " @entity17 spoke with quiet , impassioned eloquence of the difficulties his unit encountered both with segregated troops overseas and with home - front racists at a @entity206 restaurant who refused them service			2
in his breakout year of 1954 , he appeared on the cover of @entity210			0
instead of being overjoyed at what was then a prestigious coup , @entity17 recalled his embarrassment over the fact that he had been so honored ahead of @entity88 , whom he felt was far more deserving			2
being a " good guy " was no small thing to @entity17 or his fans			1
it should n't be to anyone else			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity222 .			2
