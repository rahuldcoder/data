-- in 1519 , @entity3 explorer @entity1 launched the expedition that completed the first circumnavigation of the globe			2
and so humanity learned the full extent of its world			0
this week , we learned from @entity11 that @entity14 's @entity13 spacecraft -- currently the man - made object farthest from @entity17 -- crossed a boundary of the solar system and entered interstellar space sometime last summer			1
like @entity23 's voyage , @entity13 's achievement is a major milestone in human exploration			1
in a remarkably short time by cosmic standards ( the universe being 13.7 billion years old ) , humans have evolved to the point of sending robotic diplomatic missions to other planets and stars			2
this particular emissary from the human race carries a recording of greetings in 55 languages as well as images explaining who we are			2
although the @entity13 scientists had no particular expectation of encountering other civilizations , they knew the mission would go forth unimpeded for millenniums			1
so they prepared a message for any distant future being who might stumble across this man - made artifact			0
if " @entity54 " finds @entity13 , will it phone home ? we know that planets around other stars ( " exoplanets " ) are abundant , and that when liquid water and carbon - based compounds and an energy source are present even in the most inhospitable zones on the @entity17 , life arises easily			1
but the kind of intelligent life that can build and launch a pioneering spacecraft is surely much more rare			2
and if someone answers the call , it will be sufficiently far in the future that the @entity17 - bound world as we know it will have changed beyond recognition			0
unlike missions to nearby @entity75 or @entity76 , @entity13 and 2 ( both spacecraft were launched in 1977 ) and their older siblings , @entity79 and 11 ( launched in 1972 and 1973 , respectively ) headed for outer space from the beginning			1
they visited @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 , taking photographs of unprecedented clarity and making complex measurements of the particles and magnetic fields around the planets			0
voyager 1 is the fastest - moving and most distant of the four spacecraft			2
data collected by its remaining instruments have been interpreted by scientists as indicating a crossing of the boundary between our solar system and interstellar ( " between the stars " ) space			1
it 's not a sharp boundary , and there are definitely no signposts , so there has been some debate about the exact moment of transition			2
in fact , the exact date does n't matter			0
whether it was july 2012 or august 2012 or even months earlier or later , humans have unquestionably projected their presence well beyond any previous location			0
it 's a bit different from @entity23 's voyage , however			2
in those ancient days , travel was the only way to investigate the world			0
today we survey our world -- and a large fraction of the observable universe -- using powerful telescopes , on the ground and in space			2
very deep exposures taken with the @entity134 have revealed that the @entity136 galaxy is but one of a trillion galaxies in the observable universe			0
there are hundreds of billions of stars in the @entity136 galaxy alone , each of which could have a system of planets orbiting around it			0
some of these are likely to harbor life , albeit of a primitive form			0
in terms of knowing our 21st - century world , @entity14 's robotic scientific satellites have made huge advances			1
and from the ground , telescopes study exoplanets and the @entity158 searches for extraterrestrial intelligence using a large radio telescope array in @entity161			0
in terms of receiving signals , @entity17 - bound and near - @entity17 telescopes are unsurpassed			0
in terms of outward communication , tv signals created decades ago have long since announced our presence -- in fact , because such signals travel at the speed of light , they left the solar system only days after the initial broadcast			1
but in terms of pieces of metal human hands have touched , @entity13 is unique			1
now some 36 years and a few days after it was launched into space , more than 11 billion miles from the sun , traveling at 38,000 mph , @entity13 will doubtless travel onward for tens of thousands of years to come			1
its power source wo n't last nearly that long			0
@entity13 has sufficient power for remaining instruments through at least 2020 , and if some are turned off to conserve power , a single instrument could last another five years afterward			1
but then the " little spacecraft that could " will go silent			0
forty thousand years from now , after traversing 10 trillion miles or so of interstellar space , @entity13 will approach the then - closest star , @entity191 +79 3888			1
at that point it will be a ghost ship , representing an old civilization , gone but enshrined forever in the golden record			0
as @entity201 , @entity14 's associate administrator for science in @entity203 , said , " perhaps some future deep space explorers will catch up with @entity13 , our first interstellar envoy , and reflect on how this intrepid spacecraft helped enable their journey			1
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			1

@entity14 's @entity13 spacecraft left the solar system and entered interstellar space
@entity206 : @entity13 's achievement is a major milestone in human exploration
she says the mission , launched 36 years ago , will go forth unimpeded for millenniums
@entity206 : there are no expectations that it will encounter other civilizations , but *possibility* exists
