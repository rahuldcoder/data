@entity0 , @entity1 -- when @entity7 's financial institutions crumbled and housing values plummeted , cities and families across the nation felt the tremendous impact			1
almost overnight , the reality of how we live our lives and govern our communities shifted dramatically			2
to make matters worse , no road map to help us navigate these new and troubled waters was delivered to our doorstep			2
it had to be created			2
endless dialogue and analysis about whether or not the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) is working has become a cottage industry among economists , professors and political commentators			0
the debate of whether or not the stimulus has in fact " stimulated " our economy will continue for months , and possibly years to come			1
but the picture in @entity0 , @entity1 , is clear : because of @entity21 , key projects are under way , our environment is improving -- and thousands of people are going back to work			1
@entity0 has more than 300 days of sunshine a year , so it does n't surprise anyone to learn that a key to our local economy is tourism			1
moving individuals in and out of @entity45 efficiently is critical to our economy			0
at a time when our economy had slowed to a point where new infrastructure projects did not seem possible , the city was awarded $ 11.7 million from @entity21 to reconstruct a taxiway at the airport			1
until now , the taxiway was able to handle only small aircraft and ground vehicles			0
when complete , it will be capable of moving large commercial aircraft between the north runway and the terminals at @entity45			0
@entity37 is a construction worker who was hired for the job			1
" without the stimulus , " he told the @entity60 , " i would still be out of a job			1
" because of the stimulus , though , he continues to work , to support a family , to pay a mortgage and to make purchases that contribute to our economy			2
while cities on the @entity72 struggle to keep utility bills low for residents during cold winter months , our hot summer months can cause a significant economic burden on @entity0 residents			1
the @entity69 family in central @entity0 was the first family of 1,200 households that will benefit from the city 's $ 7.2 million @entity21 weatherization grant during the next three years			1
weatherizing the @entity82 ' home is expected to shave 30 percent to 40 percent from the family 's $ 440 monthly energy bill			0
the project also employed six full - time and a dozen part - time workers			0
@entity69 , who lives with his wife , @entity90 , and two children , @entity92 , 13 and @entity93 , 11 , commented , " at a time when the economy really stinks and people were out of work , a lot of people were working on this , " he said			0
" this put paychecks in their pockets so they could feed their families			0
i think that is probably the best thing out of all of this			0
@entity108 is a seventh - and eighth - grade teacher at @entity109 in @entity0			1
last year , she was told that if @entity21 funds were not approved , she would lose her teaching position			0
if her position had been eliminated , the remaining teachers would have faced class sizes of between 40 and 50 students -- a daunting task for any educator to face			2
@entity37 , the @entity69 family and @entity108 are only three of the thousands of @entity119 who continue to be employed and contribute to our economy			0
and they , and we , have the @entity21 to thank for it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity127 .			1
