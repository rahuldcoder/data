-- a lawyer for the family of @entity3 , a @entity5 university drum major who died this month in what officials have called a hazing - related death , said monday he will sue the school			1
" we are intending to file a lawsuit to get answers " about hazing at @entity15 and @entity16 , lawyer @entity10 told reporters			1
" we are concerned about the culture of cover - up , that hazing has been covered up at the @entity20 for generations			1
so , it 's time now that we expose the truth , eradicate this culture and come up with creative remedies on how to continue the excellence of @entity20 's band , but without hazing			1
" @entity10 said he was not at liberty to discuss the facts of the case and noted that the medical examiner has not issued a report on the cause of death of the 26 - year - old musician			1
but , he added , the facts that have emerged to date " point to the fact that hazing was a cause of @entity3 's death , and it was under @entity20 's watch			1
" he said he could not address the scope of the lawsuit but added , " i can tell you that @entity20 will be named in it			0
" @entity10 described hazing at the school as a do n't ask , do n't tell culture			1
" the family 's message today is : please , tell			1
" because @entity20 is a state institution , it is protected by sovereign immunity , which means that @entity10 must file a notice of intention to sue as a prerequisite to the suit , the lawyer said			1
" after a six - month window , we will file a lawsuit , " he added			1
" he loved the band -- so much , i always called him mr. @entity20 , " @entity62 's mother , @entity61 , told reporters of her son			1
" that was his life			1
" she added that she was in suburban @entity69 , where the family lives , when a phone call informed her of her son 's death			1
the call came shortly after her son had called to say he was coming home for @entity76			0
" i thought it was some kind of mean joke			0
... maybe it 's the wrong kid , maybe it 's somebody else			2
" " they had no idea of anticipating that he 'd be coming to @entity84 when he came back to @entity69 , " @entity10 said			0
" that 's not what you send your kid to college for			2
" " it needs to stop , " @entity61 said			0
" no one wants to hear on a phone call that your son collapsed and died			2
" champion became ill at an @entity97 hotel after a game on november 20			1
he reportedly threw up in the parking lot and started complaining of not being able to breathe , authorities said			0
champion was taken to a hospital , where he was pronounced dead			0
@entity104 sheriff @entity103 told @entity0 last week that hazing was involved but added that authorities were trying to determine an official cause of death			2
under @entity5 law , any death that occurs as the result of hazing is a third - degree felony			1
after the death , @entity20 president @entity113 suspended all band performances and said he will convene a task force " to determine if there are any unauthorized and questionable activities associated with the culture of the @entity120			1
" in addition , @entity20 moved to fire longtime band director @entity122			2
@entity122 had led the 420 - member band since 1998 and has hired an attorney to fight for his job			1
" we believe that he was not treated with the respect that was due , " @entity128 attorney @entity127 said			0
he described as " ludicrous " the university 's assertion that @entity122 did not do what he could do to address hazing			1
@entity122 , who said he will speak wednesday at @entity62 's funeral , said he had told the victim 's parents about their son 's death			1
" that was extremely difficult for me , " he said			0
" i wish that this could have been avoided			0
i took the necessary steps that this tragedy could have been avoided			0
" he said he had ordered the suspension of 26 band members two weeks before @entity62 's death			1
" i thought that that would really be the end of these kinds of things , " he said , adding that his move brought criticism from some band members and parents who asked him whether the band would be able to perform adequately without 19 trombone players and others			1
" my comment was : ' it does n't matter , ' " he said			0
" i am not going to sacrifice the performance for the principle			0
" @entity122 added that he wished the administration had suspended from the school the students allegedly involved in hazing			2
" if some strong actions had been taken , then @entity3 may well be alive now , and we may not be having this gathering , " he said			1
@entity122 added that he sent memoranda in 1989 and in the 2000s about hazing 's presence on campus , not just among band members			1
" it 's no secret , " he said			2
" it 's just a culture -- as much as i regret it -- that kids nowadays engage in			1
" every year , he offers hazing workshops , and anytime a band member has been suspended for hazing , @entity122 sends a note to the school president , the vice president of student affairs , the chief of police and the band staff			1
" i probably have more than 100 , " he said			0
" i do n't know how many			0
" he added , " i feel very comfortable that i did everything that i could to eradicate hazing			2
i coined the phrase , ' @entity190 for hazing in the @entity192 band			1
' " asked whether he believes he is being made a scapegoat , @entity122 said , " yes , i do			0
" he said he had tried his best to make the administration aware of the problems			0
" how would i be negligent in reporting the activities when i did report them ? " he asked			0
@entity197 , a @entity128 lawyer who represented another hazing victim , said it was not clear whether it was white or others who were at fault			1
" he 's a legend over there , " he said			2
" he walks in a room , people listen			0
maybe it 's the rest of the system over there that fell apart			2
" @entity197 filed a suit against the school on behalf of a band trumpeter , @entity212 , who was beaten in 2001			2
@entity197 won the case for undisclosed damages ( @entity20 's sovereign immunity caps its liability for a negligence action at $ 100,000 ) and won another case against those who beat his client for $ 1.8 million , he told @entity0 in a telephone interview			2
@entity197 described the hazing as part of a deep tradition with the band , where each section acts like a fraternity			1
" the trumpet section was the @entity229 , " @entity197 said			0
" the school says you do n't have to be a member of this fraternity			0
that 's just horse s * * *			2
you could n't survive as a trumpeter if you were not a member of the @entity229			0
" the beatings meted out were carried out with paddles , but that does n't fully describe what happens , he said			0
" paddling is just the wrong word for it			0
i think one guy got hit over 100 times			0
and this is a solid , wood paddle			0
this is n't some wiffle bat			0
this is something that would kill you			0
" in @entity212 's case , he was hit 30 times in his buttocks -- " so hard they put him into renal failure , " @entity197 said			1
" his kidneys stopped working and he had to go into the emergency room			0
" @entity212 spent at least five days in critical condition , endured several surgeries and quit school , the lawyer said			2
the former student is now living in @entity270 , where he is in poor physical condition , has never fully recovered and is struggling , @entity197 said			0
" it ruins their life , " he added			2
" you do n't have to be beat to within an inch of your life to play a trumpet			2
that 's nonsense , and they know it , and this tradition is just way off base			0
" a spokeswoman for the school did not return a call seeking comment			0
on wednesday , gov. @entity288 sent a letter to @entity291 commissioner @entity290 asking the department to join the investigation " to assure that the circumstances leading to mr. @entity3 's death become fully known , and that if there are individuals directly or indirectly responsible for this death , they are appropriately brought to justice and held accountable			1
" @entity113 has acknowledged that at least 30 band members were let go this semester because of possible involvement in hazing .			1

" that was his life , " mother says of the victim 's band work
