-- go to @entity1 and the link is right there at the top , nestled between " @entity5 " and " help			1
" chances are , you have n't noticed it in your frenzy to find the perfect potato peeler			0
but if you click it , a whole different world of @entity1 opens up , one where stuff flows away from you rather than to you			1
that link reads " @entity17			0
" last year , about a billion items sold on @entity1 were n't sold by @entity1 itself but by other sellers who make their merchandise available on the site			1
one of them is @entity24 , a former @entity25 engineer who worked to ensure the @entity27 operating system played nicely with usb , the standard means of connecting peripherals to pcs and laptops			0
@entity24 now runs his own business , @entity34 , which makes a variety of usb and @entity38 hardware , from charging stations to docks that connect tablets to desktop monitors			0
with fewer than 100 employees , the company is n't huge			0
but @entity24 has no trouble running a truly global business			0
in 2006 , @entity1 launched a service that allowed @entity49 sellers to use its network of warehouses to ship their goods			1
more recently , @entity53 and company have rolled out the fulfillment by @entity1 program globally , enabling entrepreneurs like @entity24 to move goods through fulfillment centers in other parts of the world			1
" it really changes the paradigm when you 're able to ship the goods in bulk to a warehouse in @entity68 or @entity69 and have those goods be fulfilled in one day or two days , " @entity24 says			0
why are we so fat ? the multimillion - dollar scientific quest to find out while not all merchants are thrilled with their experience selling on @entity1 , the company 's logistical network has enormous reach and breadth			1
a guy like @entity24 can click that " sell " link and -- without much time or effort -- get his hardware nearly anywhere in the world			0
in effect , he becomes a " micro-exporter			0
" @entity1 's global selling program , which has evolved along with the rest of its international footprint in recent years , works much like its domestic counterpart in the @entity49			1
merchants can use the site to make their inventory available to purchase anywhere @entity1 sells			1
but the real power of the system does n't come into play until merchants also opt to use @entity1 to fulfill and ship its orders , as @entity24 does			1
merchants in the @entity49 who want to expand globally can list their products in @entity1 's nine international @entity1 marketplaces -- the @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity69 , and @entity112			1
as they do domestically , sellers can export their goods in bulk to @entity1 warehouses in those hubs			1
from those , @entity1 says it ships goods to about 180 countries around the world			1
" the small seller suddenly has access to the global marketplace , " says @entity121 , @entity1 's vice president of seller services			1
@entity121 says the power of global selling and shipping is huge			0
goods from sellers targeting only @entity49 consumers can be seen by about 100 million potential customers			1
expand that reach globally and the number of potential customers grows to 250 million			1
and it 's not just @entity49 merchants selling globally			2
@entity121 says sellers from 89 countries use fulfillment by @entity1 to sell goods to @entity49 customers			1
but the advantages @entity1 gains by enabling micro-exports extend beyond the fees charged for its services			1
as @entity121 puts it , a global network of small sellers can be incredibly nimble in response to shifts in demand around the world			2
sellers can move their inventory from one hub to another according to their perceptions of where demand is greatest			2
unexpected shooting targets used by the world 's armies the result is a global agility for @entity1 without the need to pull levers itself			2
an army of sellers becomes deputized to build out the long tail of global retail			2
" we often can see patterns in what they 're doing faster than what we see in our own business , " @entity121 says			0
for @entity24 , the ability to send bulk inventory to cross-border hubs saves money compared to shipping individual packages overseas , an approach he says is less error - prone than shipping piecemeal			0
" we basically get the leverage , the huge scale that @entity1 has in negotiating with shipping partners , " he says			2
outsourcing everything from taking and shipping orders to converting currencies , accepting payments , and handling taxes lets @entity191 focus on customer service , which @entity24 calls a key way to set itself apart in the crowded gadget market			2
@entity196 global selling and shipping also lets @entity198 take the temperature of truly global demand before committing to any inventory at all			2
@entity24 runs ideas for new products through @entity204 , which not only allows @entity198 to see what consumers want but where in the world demand is strongest			0
if the @entity204 campaign succeeds , he says , he divides up the inventory of new products rolling off the assembly line according to relative demand in different parts of the globe			0
instead of sending individual orders all over the world , @entity191 ships in bulk to the international hubs where @entity1 has facilities			2
from those locations , most of the world opens up to @entity24 and his business -- a scale he says his business needs in order to make it			0
" they 're very cool products and very cool technologies , but they 're a bit niche - y , " @entity24 says of his usb lines			0
" if you were selling on just local channels , there 's not enough of a market to justify the costs			0
