-- long before there was @entity3 there was @entity4			1
with its slick , beautifully designed products at the cutting edge of innovation , the @entity6 company was once at the forefront of the race to produce a personal computer for mass consumption			1
the @entity16 based manufacturer spent years honing the design of its typewriters , calculators and adding machines , agonising over everything from the position of the keys to the shape of the space bar			2
and everyone from @entity27 to @entity28 used an @entity4 typewriter to bang out some of the world 's best known novels and songs			1
while the company has never recovered its leading position , a humble start - up aims to put @entity16 back on the world innovation and design map			1
open - source hardware called @entity42 , after the local bar where the five founders met to discuss their project , the company produces simple open - source electronics platforms that allows enthusiasts and professionals to build interactive projects			1
now , almost ten years after the company produced its first single - board microcontroller , more than 700,000 are in the hands of hobbyists and professionals , operating everything from drones and robots to lights and motors			1
co-founder @entity42 told @entity0 that @entity42 is not only an educational tool , but also a way of exploring new ideas with new people			2
" it 's been an emerging phenomenon since the late 1990s , " @entity61 said			0
" different schools around the world have tried to bring electronics to designers and artists to get them to come up with more creative uses for technology			2
" arduino boards also have a distinctive and striking design , in recognition of which they will go on display at @entity75 in @entity76 in 2015			1
@entity4 roots operating from a part of the old @entity4 building in @entity16 , @entity42 stamps out the blue microprocessors which operate under a form of open source that allows amateurs , designers and artists to come up with new uses for the circuit board			1
@entity61 explained that when they launched the project , the only thing the team wanted to protect was the brand			0
its use or misuse ( one reason the boards have a robust construction and retail for less than us $ 50 ) is entirely in the public domain under a creative commons license			0
as a microprocessor for controlling sensors , @entity42 is unparalleled and is becoming a common feature of the prototyping phase of many start - ups			2
" i would n't be risking very much if i said that a lot of the products you see on @entity110 use @entity42 boards in the prototyping phase to control various aspects of the project , " he said			1
he said one of the most interesting applications has been the development of the open platform @entity119 mission , which for the first time allow the general public to run their own space - based applications			0
" you will be able to rent a timeslot to manipulate the machine so you can simulate your experiment on land with an @entity42 board and you can simulate it in space on the satellite , " he said			1
putting the pieces together one of the more surprising applications has been the natural marriage between the @entity42 board and @entity135			1
once seen only as a child 's building block toy , @entity135 is finding startling utility as an instant mechanical prototype maker for @entity42 ideas			1
" @entity135 is very interesting in a sense that it provides mechanical access to the world			0
it lets you build almost anything within some constraints -- you ca n't , for instance , build something that 's perfectly round with @entity135			0
" @entity42 is at the same level but with electronics			2
it allows you to control things at a low level really , really well			0
" but in the face of ever more sophisticated technology , keeping @entity42 simple is no easy feat. " the more simple you make it for the user , the more complex it becomes at the back end , " @entity158 said			1
" for example , the @entity163 -- one of our latest products -- basically allows you to connect anything to @entity168 or anything to the ethernet			0
" it can control it at a low level on the net or on the cloud but to make it easy for the users we had to imbed a whole @entity180 computer into it at that size			0
" the complexity in the stomach of the beast just gets bigger			0
" while @entity42 is most closely associated with robotics , @entity61 said the application of electronics goes far beyond a concept of robotics , which he says has not changed dramatically over the past 70 years			2
" for example , they have discovered that 3d printing lab parts makes them sterile by definition			0
you can 3d print a test tube to put micro-organisms in and that will be sterile because it is being produced by a plastic that must be heated to 250 degrees @entity201			0
" for â ‚ ¬ 1.000 , you can have a machine capable of making sterile lab equipment			0
that is super cheap and can help laboratories and hospitals all around the world			0

@entity42 , the open source electronic hardware , hails from @entity16 , the home of @entity4
@entity4 was once at the forefront of @entity6 technology and designed the world 's first *pc*
there are now more than 700,000 @entity42 boards in the hands of hobbyists and professionals
an @entity42 circuit board will go on display at @entity75 in @entity76 in 2015
