-- alongside his quest to add more @entity4 medals to his collection of 16 , swimmer @entity1 has taken some time outside of the water to dive into his first video game			1
the 14 - time gold medalist has partnered with publisher @entity11 and developer @entity12 to create the world 's first swimming game for @entity18 's @entity17 system			1
" @entity1 : push the limit " is played without any controllers , allowing players to move their bodies to replicate swimming styles like backstroke , butterfly and breaststroke and virtually swim in competitions around the world			1
@entity27 , who instructs players in the game on how to improve their swimming , also provided voice work and his motion - capture likeness for the game			1
he worked with the development team throughout the creative process			1
a life - long gamer , the @entity39 , @entity40 , native is focused on training for the @entity44			1
but he 's also using technology , including the new video game , to help generate awareness for his sport outside of the global spotlight every four years			1
in this interview for @entity0 , @entity27 talks about gaming , @entity52 , and why he 's addicted to the mobile game " @entity54			1
" how often do you play video games ? i probably play two or three days a week			1
it 's mostly just sports games like " @entity60 " , " @entity61 " , " @entity62 " and " @entity63			1
" i 've always loved the sporting games			1
every now and then we 'll play " @entity69 " online , but i just get destroyed every time and it 's not really that fun			1
what was it like for you to get involved in your own video game ? it was weird			1
i still look at the game cover and i 'm like , " wow			1
" but it 's kind of cool			1
growing up a gamer and being able to work on the little things in this game like the different venues and those types of details has been a dream come true			1
the opportunities that i 've had to take the sport to a new level and change it and do things that people have n't seen before has been fun			1
and now having a game on @entity17 , it 's not every day a swimmer has that			1
it 's just exciting and hopefully everybody out there can enjoy it as much as i have enjoyed the creative process of building it and playing it and making it and being a part of everything			2
when it comes to the motion controls of the @entity17 , what did that open up for swimming ? past ( swimming ) games have just been about hitting the a and b buttons quickly			1
@entity17 allowed us to get gamers up and actually go through the motions to feel like you are swimming			1
it 's cool for me because this game might help people not only get into the sport more , but to also get up and be active			1
that 's something that 's very important for not only kids , but everybody out there			2
how much of a workout can players get from this game ? it actually is hard even for me			1
i did have a challenging time playing it , but once you get in the groove it 's not too bad			2
it is fairly realistic though , and that 's one of the things i really wanted to have in this game			1
it 's going to be interesting to see how people like it			2
i 've been getting people sending me messages on @entity52 constantly about it			2
it is a way to get off the couch and get active instead of sitting there with the controller and just tapping buttons			2
it 's much more interactive than regular games are			2
can people learn about swimming from playing the game ? yeah , i 'm sure			1
the better form you have , the faster you 're going to go			2
i found a lot of people were afraid to put their face under the water			2
so if they actually feel comfortable being able to just swim the strokes , maybe they 'll feel comfortable when they get in the water			1
there are a lot of things that could happen and hopefully we can get more people in the pool and around the pool			2
what 's your favorite piece of technology that you ca n't live without ? i 'm always on my phone			2
i 'm always on @entity52			2
i 'm constantly on my @entity171 and @entity172			2
i think the apps and everything on iphones are just unbelievable			2
do you have a favorite app that you play around with ? i have not been able to stop playing " @entity54			0
" ever since i got it , i 've been playing it constantly			0
i ca n't even invite any more people to play because i 'm at the max amount of games you can have			0
i have 30 games going at once			0
i 'm literally on it non-stop			0
i took the train up yesterday and that 's all i was doing			0
i had my headphones on and i was playing " @entity54			0
" so it kills time			0
it 's fun , and it 's competitive			0
what are your thoughts about how far games have come on smartphones ? it 's unbelievable			0
you can do anything from your phone			0
i never thought that i would switch from @entity171 to the @entity172 , but gradually i 'm taking myself away from the @entity171 and going to the @entity172 and it really is amazing			0
you can get anything from directions to restaurants to games			0
like the commercial says , there 's an app for that			0
how does technology allow you to connect with your fans , especially during the off @entity4 years ? that 's been one of the cool things			0
i said i would never get on @entity52			0
and i stayed away from it until last december and ( since then ) i literally have n't put it down			0
it 's a cool way to connect with people all over the world			0
there have been fans from @entity222 and @entity223 and everywhere who are constantly tweeting at me or asking things			0
people ask me about the video game or about how i 'm training			1
it 's been fun to keep everybody in the loop of what 's going on			0
what are you looking forward to with the next @entity4 ? i think the biggest thing is just trying to prepare myself the best way i can			0
over the years i probably have n't been in the best shape , but i 'm in better shape now than i was in ' 09 or ' 10 and this past summer			0
hopefully in the next ten months i can get in even better shape and just try and accomplish the goals that i have			0
i have a lot of goals that i want to accomplish in and out of the water before i retire			0
if i 'm able to do that , then i can look back on my career and say it 's been a success			0
can you share any of the goals ? my coach and i are the only two that know			0
throughout my career i 've always sort of kept them between him and i , and we 're the only two that are really going to be able to help each other get to the goals that we have			0
we 're more relaxed now than we ever have been and we 're having fun , so who knows what can happen ? the sky is the limit			1
we have a lot to do and the @entity4 will be here before we know it .			0
