-- " i could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas , but what i decided to do was fulfill my profession , " @entity0 famously snapped on the campaign trail two decades ago friday			1
mostly , we remember the comment as a moment in the perpetual mommy wars , but i tend to think about it as a moment in the history of chocolate chip cookies			2
capitalizing on the political gaffe , @entity17 challenged @entity19 to a bake - off , and she obliged , providing an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe that handily defeated @entity24 's variant			1
( you can still find it winning rave reviews online			0
) home - baked cookies struck at the heart of what we thought mothering was all about			1
it 's still true today , but we have given it new meaning			2
in 1992 , @entity19 's comment drew scorching responses from at - home mothers and cheers from fellow working moms			1
such polarized reactions should be set in the context of @entity19 's own life			2
among the few women in her @entity46 class , @entity19 fought hard for professional success			2
her remark was not merely a political misstep , but a generational declaration : a reflection of gut - level struggles women had made for workplace opportunity , even as mothers			1
yet , the long reach of what was , after all , an offhand remark touches on something deeper than a mere episode in the nation 's contrived reality show , " @entity64			1
" through the twists and turns of that cookie - baking scandal , we experienced the birthing pains of the working family			1
an idealized image of mothering stays powerfully with us : children arriving home from school , met at the door with warm chocolate chip cookies and a motherly embrace			2
that image evokes devotion , time and , most importantly , love			0
it is middle - class parenting unstressed by the demands of labor , whether paid or unpaid ( the pans and trays awaiting washing are generally conveniently left out of the picture )			2
what was true 20 years ago is still true today : many of us struggle with profound ambivalence about the demands that mothers ' paid labor make on that idealized possibility			1
we long to care without pressure			0
the still distinct memory of @entity19 's unsavvy comment speaks to a deep - seated cultural experience of loss			1
with more than two - thirds of mothers in the labor force today , few families are immune to negotiating child care and paid work			0
the plate of chocolate chip cookies embodies our desire for parenting and family space free of the demands of our paid jobs			0
still , there are signs of change			0
" working family " was a term newly in use when @entity19 made her famous comment , but working mothers have been , however messily and tentatively , forging a new model of parenting and laboring since that time			1
parents ' priorities have changed , but not at the expense of their kids			0
recent studies of time use by sociologists at the @entity134 show employed mothers spending as much time in primary child care as nonemployed mothers in 1975			0
working - family mothers live with messier houses but report higher levels of enjoyment in their children 's company than three decades ago			1
today 's working mother may be mixing up fewer batches of cookies , but when she does , she 's often baking with the kids -- the activity not so much abandoned , as reserved for moments that matter to parent and child			1
this new pragmatism does n't mean there 's no lingering guilt			0
the middle - class parents who still suffer most , i suspect , from cookie angst could learn from working - class women who have long seen good parenting in providing			1
devotion to children can come in the form of earning what it takes to put treats on the table			0
and they would do well to listen to another first lady , @entity169 , who as a black woman is well schooled in the multiple roles that black women , whether middle class or poor , have long fulfilled			0
black mothers historically have believed they are dedicated mothers , even while earning money for their families			0
no one assumed that @entity169 , in her lawyer days before the @entity179 , devoted herself to cookie making , but we knew she was a good mother			0
although it has not been as widely reported about as her gardens , @entity169 has been a voice for working families in the @entity179 , speaking regularly on behalf of work - life initiatives			1
true , her shortbread cookies lost to @entity189 's oatmeal - butterscotch in @entity17 's 2008 bake - off			2
but more telling was that @entity193 magazine named her one of the country 's most powerful working moms in 2011			2
i have always been embarrassed by @entity19 's cookies			0
they seemed like a capitulation to politics seeking to turn back the clock on women 's roles			1
but i have begun to think that i should n't be			0
twenty years ago friday , that first lady campaigner made a divisive declaration on working motherhood			1
perhaps we should see @entity19 's successful decades in the public limelight since as a lesson in the new pragmatism			0
like @entity19 , we can have our cookies , and careers , too			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity216 .			2

@entity216 : @entity0 's " cookie - baking " remark stung women 20 years ago
**swinth** : in *hindsight* , it spoke to women 's struggles *balancing* home and the workplace
she says *controversy* reflected *emerging* trend that is common now : the working family
**swinth** : cookie comment was seen as divisive but should have been seen as pragmatic
