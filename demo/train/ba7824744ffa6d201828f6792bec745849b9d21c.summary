-- the @entity2 faces " a 10 - year issue " in @entity6 as it weighs how deeply it wants to get involved the country 's civil war , the top @entity2 military officer warned in an interview that aired sunday			1
army gen. @entity8 told @entity0 's @entity9 that the conflict is entwined in a regional issue that is now spilling over into both @entity12 and @entity13 , and those underlying causes " will persist for 10 years			1
" " it is related -- not exclusively -- but related to a competition at best and a conflict at worse between the @entity20 and @entity21 sects of @entity22 , and it 's been hijacked at some level on both sides by extremists -- @entity27 on one side and @entity12 @entity29 and others on the other side , " said @entity8 , chairman of the @entity15			1
he added , " this is about a 10 - year issue , and if we fail to think about it as a 10 - year regional issue , we could make some mistakes			2
" @entity6 's civil war began in early 2011 , when the government of president @entity39 turned police and troops on anti-government demonstrations			2
the crackdown mushroomed into a conflict that has left more than more than 90,000 dead , according to the @entity45			0
the @entity47 administration announced in june that government troops had crossed a " red line " by using chemical weapons against rebel forces , prompting it to increase what has so far been non-lethal aid to the opposition			0
the administration plans to send small arms , ammunition and potentially anti-tank weapons to @entity6 's rebels , officials familiar with the matter told @entity0			1
critics such as sen. @entity63 , the ranking @entity64 on the @entity65 , call the response too little , too late			2
" as usual , on these issues , they 're undecided and going forward with a debate while events transpire , " @entity63 told @entity71 ' " @entity70 " on sunday			1
" there 's no better example of that than @entity6 , as we continue to watch @entity29 , thousands of fighters ; we see @entity75 weapons pouring in , and slaughter of now over 100,000 people			0
and we 're going to send them light weapons ? light weapons do n't do well against tanks			0
" but @entity8 , @entity47 's principal military adviser , told @entity0 the war in @entity6 is " not a simple matter of stopping the fight by the introduction of any particular @entity2 capability			1
" @entity90 turns spotlight on @entity6 " it seems to me that we need to understand what the peace will look like before we start the war , " he said			1
what complicates the question of military support for the opposition is that many of the rebel fighters are militants with pro-al @entity27 sympathies , the same stripe of militants @entity2 has battled in @entity13 and @entity105			0
they include the @entity106 , a rebel group that the @entity2 says has links to @entity27			0
meanwhile , the @entity2 has been bolstering efforts to keep the conflict from spreading to @entity110 , where an @entity2 military presence is quietly growing			0
and in discussions of the use of air power to enforce a " no - fly " zone , as was done in @entity117 's civil war in 2011 , @entity8 has raised concerns about the need for clear objectives and a full understanding of the risks before acting			2
no sanctuary for @entity6 's female refugees			0

@entity6 is a regional conflict where causes " will persist for 10 years , " @entity8 says
" we need to understand what the peace will look like before we start the war "
@entity134 is weighing whether to arm @entity6 rebels
the administration is " going forward with a debate while events transpire , " @entity63 says
