-- @entity1 have won the @entity3 @entity2 for the second time in four years , and fifth time in their history , after beating @entity6 2 - 0 in the @entity8 final on wednesday			1
a superb early strike from @entity10 set @entity1 on their way and a late breakaway goal from @entity13 secured victory and prevented @entity6 from adding to their @entity16 triumph over @entity17 last week			1
the @entity18 -- who beat @entity19 1 - 0 in the final in 2007 -- got off to a perfect start when they went ahead in just the fifth minute			0
a @entity13 shot from the right was blocked by the @entity6 defense , but the ball fell superbly to @entity10 on the edge of the area , who let fly with a powerful left - foot strike that gave goalkeeper @entity28 no chance			2
@entity6 poured forward looking for an equalizer and top scorer @entity31 was denied on more than one occasion -- notably when @entity1 goalkeeper @entity33 made a superb save in the 79th minute			0
but their constant attacking left gaps at the back and in the final minute @entity1 broke clear , leaving @entity38 time and space to round @entity28 before firing the ball home , sending the @entity1 fans -- who were out - numbered by the @entity6 supporters -- into raptures			2
the result completes a memorable four days for @entity1 , who have added the cup to their success in snatching fourth position in @entity50 on sunday -- and a place in next season 's @entity52 .			0

@entity1 defeat @entity6 2 - 0 at the @entity8 to *win* the @entity3 @entity2
an early strike from @entity10 and a late @entity13 breakaway secures victory
the result means @entity6 failed to add the *trophy* to their success in the @entity16
