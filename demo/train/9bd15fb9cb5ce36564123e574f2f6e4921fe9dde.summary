-- @entity2 fever gripped the host nation on wednesday as @entity4 won its first gold medals of the @entity6 , but in a quiet corner of @entity9 arguably the greatest sporting performance of the day was played out before a much smaller audience of just 13,000 people			2
@entity12 , the world 's top - ranked racehorse , defended his unbeaten record in typically emphatic style , thrashing his rivals to win the showpiece @entity18 at the @entity21 meeting by sixth lengths from @entity23 -- a valiant second under @entity25			1
he became the first horse to win the @entity28 race two years in a row			1
it was the 12th victory of @entity12 's career , and the eighth at @entity28 level -- seven of those in a row , drawing him level with @entity37 and @entity38 but two short of @entity40 's leading elite mark			1
the margin of victory would have been greater had jockey @entity43 not eased @entity12 down in the final strides , but his success was widely expected			1
the @entity46 - trained four - year - old was sent off at odds of 20 - 1 on , meaning a bet of $ 20 would return just $ 1			0
although there are few certainties in the field of athletic endeavor , the result of this race never looked in doubt			0
led out , as usual , by his big brother and pace maker @entity59 , @entity12 destroyed the field with such insouciant ease that at times the race resembled a time trial			1
even cycling champion @entity64 , however , is not capable of the sustained burst of speed that is @entity12 's hallmark -- every one of his all - devouring strides opened up more and ground between him and the rest of the field			2
while @entity12 is undoubtedly great news for racing -- he is the only equine athlete who regularly grabs the headlines from his human counterparts -- to some degree the hype around this superstar has turned him into a victim of his own success			0
these days he runs against ever - dwindling fields -- on this occasion just three rivals went to the start , and that included stable companion @entity59 , whose sole purpose in life is to give @entity12 a flying start in his races then humbly fade into obscurity in the final furlongs			2
if horses were capable of sibling rivalry , then @entity59 would surely be a candidate for the psychiatrist 's couch			0
given the testing conditions at the @entity99 course ( several horses had already come a cropper around the famously tight right - hand bend ) , this was never going to be a procession on the scale of the 11 - length drubbing @entity12 handed out at @entity105 back in june			1
but sixth lengths -- and an eased - down sixth lengths at that -- is still a huge margin in racing terms			0
@entity12 's next challenge will be the @entity112 at @entity113 later this month , which will see him step up from the mile distance for the first time in his career			1
if there was a cloud to @entity12 's silver lining it was that @entity46 , who has masterminded the horse 's career to perfection , could not be at @entity21 to enjoy his colt 's success			1
the 69 - year - old is undergoing another bout of treatment for cancer			0
his jockey , however , was a picture of modesty when accepting the plaudits for the horse 's latest performance : " he does it all very easily and therefore i have a very easy job , " @entity43 told reporters			2
" all i have to do is steer			0
" such is @entity12 's dominance in his own sport that the comparisons tend to be made with athletes from outside of his own species , such as 0.49 - furlong runner @entity146 , record - breaking swimmer @entity147 or the hitherto - peerless @entity148			0
if the successes keep coming in this fashion , @entity149 had better watch their backs , for , human or non-human , we could be witnessing the greatest of all time .			0

@entity12 becomes first horse to defend @entity18 title at @entity21
the unbeaten colt , ranked *no.* 1 in world , wins his seventh successive @entity28 race
jockey @entity43 guides @entity12 to a six - length victory at the @entity9 meeting
his next race will see him step up from the mile distance for the first time in his career
