editor 's note : @entity2 , a professor at the @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity5 , has written and lectured widely on criminal law and criminal procedure			1
among his articles was a 2007 piece for the @entity10 : " the stepford justices : the need for @entity13 on the @entity14			0
" he is a graduate of @entity16 and the @entity17			1
@entity2 says there are striking similarities in the backgrounds of the @entity22 justices			1
@entity4 , @entity5 ( @entity23 ) -- with the retirement of justice @entity26 , president @entity24 has the opportunity to bring a special kind of diversity to the @entity22 : the diversity of broad and varied governmental experience			1
it is certainly true that the court needs more racial and gender diversity			2
yet the homogeneity of the work résumés of the current justices is unprecedented			0
the right nominee would help to correct this			0
many commentators have noted that this is the first @entity22 in @entity43 history in which every justice has come from exactly the same job : judge on the @entity43 @entity46			1
but there are other " firsts " that are equally disturbing			0
for the first time in @entity43 history , not a single justice has had any legislative experience			2
not one has ever been elected to @entity54 , a state legislature or a city council			0
for the first time in @entity43 history , not a single justice has ever held -- or even run for -- any elective office at any level of government			1
( although @entity26 once served as a state attorney general , that is an appointed office in @entity61			2
) for the first time in @entity43 history , eight of the nine justices attended one of only two law schools : @entity16 or @entity66			1
( although justice @entity68 graduated from @entity69 , she transferred from @entity70			0
) traditionally , the @entity22 has been composed not only of former judges , but also lawyers who have come directly from serving as senators , governors , @entity76 members , heads of administrative agencies , and even from private practice			1
yet it has been almost 30 years since a justice has been confirmed who was not then a federal appellate judge			2
what caused this change ? some point to the acrimony that surrounded the failed appointment of @entity88 in 1987			0
since that time , presidents of both parties have stressed the judicial competence -- not the ideology -- of their appointees			0
the implied promise is that the technical proficiency of an @entity97 - trained federal appellate judge somehow trumps issues of ideology			2
this , of course , is an illusion			0
the cases that come to the @entity22 are there precisely because they fall between the cracks of established legal doctrine			1
there is no single " @entity97 judge 's answer " to any issue pending before the @entity22			1
for example , take a look at the @entity22 's 2006 term			1
the court decided 72 cases			0
with all the justices coming from the federal appellate bench and eight of them having attended @entity16 or @entity66 , did this help achieve consensus ? on the contrary , the percentage of cases in which there was a unanimous decision was the second lowest in a decade			1
and 24 decisions -- fully one - third of the docket -- were decided by a 5 - 4 vote , the highest percentage of 5 - 4 decisions in over a decade			0
the best example of how there is no single " judge 's answer " to @entity22 issues can be found in the eight death penalty cases decided during the 2006 term			1
the cases had a variety of issues , including questions concerning the selection of jurors , the giving of jury instructions and competence of defense counsel			0
yet every single case was decided 5 - 4			0
in every single case , justices @entity150 , @entity152 , @entity153 and chief justice @entity154 held for the prosecution			0
in every single case , justices @entity156 , @entity26 , @entity68 and @entity158 held for the defense			0
every case was decided by justice @entity161 's vote : four times for the prosecution and four times for the defense			0
looking for a single " judge 's answer " to an issue before the @entity22 is usually futile			1
in order to decide the great legal issues before the court , a justice needs to bring more than mere legal competence ; a justice also needs to bring real - world experience , values and intuition			0
that is why it is self - defeating to restrict the range of possible @entity22 nominees to the small group of sitting federal appellate judges			1
@entity22 decision - making would be richer if it included people who had actually written legislation or had run federal agencies or had governed states			1
as @entity191 sen. @entity190 recently said , there is a need to select @entity22 nominees " from outside the judicial monastery			1
" we should welcome , and not irrationally restrict , the variety of experience that can be brought to @entity22 decision - making			2
professor @entity198 of @entity199 has observed that " diversity of inputs makes for stronger outputs			0
" @entity24 should cast the widest possible net to find a person who can bring a fresh set of experiences and perspectives to the work of the @entity22			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : no judge on @entity22 now has legislative background
he says none of the nine have held , or even run for , elective office
@entity2 : all but one attended @entity16 or @entity66
he says court would perform better if its membership had broader backgrounds
