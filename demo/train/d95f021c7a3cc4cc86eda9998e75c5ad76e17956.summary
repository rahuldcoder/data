but he showed no ill effects on home soil at last year 's @entity11 in @entity12 , claiming the double in the 5,000 and 10,000 meters -- and popularizing the @entity14 in the process			1
and on saturday in @entity17 , the @entity16 edged @entity7 in the 10,000 meters to add to his 5,000 - meter world title			1
@entity20 king @entity19 , who also shone in @entity12 , later eased through in the 100 - meter heats on the opening day of the championships			1
@entity4 crossed the line in 27 minutes , 21.71 seconds in front of a less than packed @entity26 , defeating @entity7 by nearly half a second			1
he ran the last lap in an impressive 54 seconds to hold off the @entity29 , who had overtaken @entity4 in the final few meters in @entity6			1

" but it 's definitely been worth it			0
" @entity59 @entity58 , @entity4 's training partner , missed out on the bronze as @entity62 's @entity61 grabbed third			2
he took time , though , to praise @entity4			2
" he was the best last year and that continues this year , " @entity58 told the @entity31			0
" i think the great thing about him is he continues to do the same things and he knows he has to work so hard in training and that 's what makes him the type of runner he is			0
" @entity19 , meanwhile , cruised in his heat in 10.07 seconds			1
he is the overwhelming favorite in sunday 's final since reigning world champion and fellow @entity78 @entity77 skipped the event due to a hamstring injury and @entity59 @entity81 pulled out after testing positive for a banned substance			0
