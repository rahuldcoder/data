-- @entity2 officials have announced the biggest increase in prize money in the history of tennis as part of a bid to make the sport attractive for future generations of players			1
the @entity12 , which organizes the oldest grand slam tournament , has hiked prize money by 40 % to $ 34.4 million so the winners of the men and women 's competitions will each take home $ 2.4 million			1
@entity2 has also revealed that it will build a roof over @entity20 , with the structure expected to be completed in time for the 2019 tournament			1
the retractable roof , which is expected to be similar to that which has been in place on @entity27 since 2009 , will allow matches to progress despite any bad weather -- with rain a regular threat at the grass - court event			1

this year 's @entity44 will have its prize fund increased by $ 4 million to $ 29.5 million , while next month 's @entity46 will see the winners earn $ 1.95 million with the total purse up by 16 %			1
the increases in prize money come following pressure from top players concerned with the huge disparities between those who exit grand slam tournaments at an early stage and those who go much further			1
at @entity2 , the purse for winning the title has gone up with the male and female winner taking home a check of Â £ 1.6 million -- a 39 % increase on last year			1
@entity2 , which will be held from june 24 to july 7 this year , has also put more cash into the opening three rounds of the tournament by 60 %			2
players losing in the first round will net $ 35,800 , which is a big improvement on the $ 22,100 they would have picked up in 2012			0
on top of that , the reward for qualifying for the tournament proper has gone up by 41 % for singles players and 22 % for doubles players			2
