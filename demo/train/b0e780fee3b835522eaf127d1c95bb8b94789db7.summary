-- a pen and a phone may not seem too dangerous , but in the hands of president @entity5 and congressional democrats , they have proven to be devastating			2
just four years ago , when @entity6 controlled @entity7 , @entity5 called then - house speaker @entity8 and turned over our country 's health care policy to the @entity6			2
and then with his pen , he signed one of the most damaging pieces of health care legislation into law			0
@entity5 has promised us he 'll use that pen and phone again to unilaterally drive his job - destroying agenda -- and he 's expected to repeat that promise in tuesday night 's @entity21			0
and for every @entity24 family that is being crushed by the president 's failed economy and his disastrous health care law , the stakes could n't be higher			1
state of gop : misguided and obsessed as we enter the election year , it 's clear that the @entity34 @entity33 is the only remaining check and balance on an increasingly unpopular president and an increasingly unpopular government health care system			1
no matter how many times @entity5 unilaterally decides to delay certain parts of @entity41 , the fact remains that the law is not working and will only get worse with time			1
the climate has become so toxic for @entity6 that @entity44			0
@entity45 and @entity46 -- two of the most vulnerable @entity6 in the country -- recently announced their retirements , taking two seats completely off the board for @entity52			0
remember , @entity45 held the most @entity34 district of any @entity33 @entity54 in the country and @entity57 's district was n't far behind			1
@entity5 , the pain and fear must be named these are n't the only tragic blows for @entity52			0
@entity62 from @entity63 recently announced his retirement too , leaving open a district in which @entity34 are in a solid position to win			1
and one of their prized recruits , @entity67 in @entity68 , dropped out of his race just weeks after announcing			0
seems the toll of @entity41 and @entity5 's anemic approval ratings are proving insurmountable for both incumbents and candidates			1
this year 's @entity21 is a defining test for @entity5 in contrast , @entity34 have had a string of recruitment successes			1
our pickup opportunities are all over the country , from @entity84 to @entity85			0
we have top - tier candidates like @entity88 veteran @entity87 in @entity89 , son of @entity92 exiles @entity93 in @entity94 , and former democrat @entity95 in @entity96 -- who was so tired of @entity5 's " war on coal " that he switched parties to challenge vulnerable @entity54 @entity100 -- just to name a few			0
@entity41 is not going away as a political issue			1
the failures we 've seen so far are just the beginning , and the consequences are n't just political			2
bottom line , the @entity24 people do n't need a pen and a phone			2
what they really need is a job and a paycheck			0
