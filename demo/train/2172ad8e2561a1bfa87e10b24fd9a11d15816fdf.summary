-- add another chapter to the illustrious history of freewheeling vice presidential debates			0
at @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity4 and @entity5 engaged in what might euphemistically be described as a lively exchange of ideas			1
in reality it felt more like a testy verbal brawl between father and son			0
consider these key 5 moments from the debate			0
@entity5 : no need to apologize this is a well played moment by @entity5 , one of his best of the debate			2
he has a specific argument to make , and he fleshes out that argument clearly and logically			0
@entity5 also delivers the material in an effective way			2
you can see his face become more animated as he speaks , and he uses simple rhetoric to express his doubts about the @entity32 administration 's handling of the killing of the @entity35 ambassador to @entity36			2
politics : five things we learned from the vp debate @entity4 's strategic anger in this clip , @entity4 delivers the attack everybody had expected president @entity32 to launch in the first debate			1
@entity4 is sharply critical of disparaging comments made by @entity46 and @entity5 about @entity35 who , for one reason or another , do not pay income tax			1
he takes a large philosophical abstraction about the role of government in people 's lives and personalizes it , citing his parents , his neighbors , the people he grew up with , seniors , veterans and soldiers fighting in @entity59			0
it 's quite a list , and he delivers it convincingly and passionately			0
@entity5 pushes back on the 47 % remark this represents an attempt by @entity5 to use humor to deflect a negative , in this case @entity46 's now - famous comment about the 47 % of @entity35 who do n't pay taxes			1
debate strategists plan these moments in advance , but it is impossible to predict how they will actually play			0
in joking about @entity4 's propensity for verbal gaffes , @entity5 is suggesting that @entity46 mangled his words when referring to the 47 %			1
@entity5 does a decent job delivering the line that had been written for him , and he even gets a laugh from the audience			2
but in the final analysis there 's not much ryan or anyone else can do to counteract the damage caused by @entity46 's original comment			2
@entity4 : now you 're @entity87 ? in this exchange the two candidates struggle to dominate the conversation -- again , i am reminded of a father and son going at it over the dinner table			1
the look of feigned incredulity on @entity4 's face as @entity5 speaks is priceless			1
for his part , @entity5 can barely contain his exasperation at being talked over			2
@entity4 's line -- " oh , and now you 're @entity87 " -- is a not too subtle allusion to the classic vice presidential debate putdown from 1988 , when @entity104 told @entity105 , " senator , you 're no @entity87			1
" @entity5 attempts to laugh off the insult , but he seems a bit rattled here			0
@entity4 appears to have hit a nerve			2
should n't candidates know by now that it 's never safe to invoke @entity87 in a presidential debate ? politics : first two debates could n't be more different @entity5 loses his cool stylistically this is one of @entity5 's low points in the debate			1
unsure how to handle @entity4 's perturbed tone , @entity5 loses his cool			1
he begins squirming in his chair and moving his neck like a bobblehead doll			0
at a couple of points he emits a strange , snort - like chuckle , a sound that does not exactly enhance his maturity			0
for the most part in this debate , @entity5 did not let an overbearing @entity4 get under his skin , but not in this clip			1
let 's give @entity5 credit where credit is due			2
before the debate he predicted that @entity4 would come at him " like a cannonball , " and indeed he did			2
though it was n't always pretty , @entity4 managed to dominate the evening , an old lion who had no intention of being taken down by the young gun sitting across the table			1
like a master thespian on opening night , @entity4 conspicuously deployed pretty much his entire bag of performing tricks : dramatic line - readings , huge smiles , exaggerated laughter , asides to the audience			0
as over-the - top as some of this became , it got the job done			0
for much of the debate the super-charged veep kept his opponent in a defensive crouch			0
at times it looked as if @entity5 was afraid @entity4 might ground him and take away the car keys			1
@entity5 did have his moments in this debate , but overall he came across as not quite seasoned enough for the office he seeks			1
undergirding every vice presidential debate is the question of which candidate is ready to step into the @entity166 at a moment 's notice			0
by this standard , @entity5 failed to hit the mark			2
which is not to suggest that the man has no future in presidential politics			0
the years will obviously take him beyond the problem of immaturity			0
if @entity46 loses this election , it is not inconceivable that four years from now @entity5 and @entity4 might even end up back onstage together , as co-stars in a presidential debate			1
opinion : sports bar @entity4 vs. seminar @entity5 overall , this debate 's most striking characteristic was the age gap between candidates			1
in the optics of televised debates a generational difference can cut either way : the older candidate might look out of date and past his prime , or wise and experienced			0
the younger candidate might look fresh and energetic , or not ready for prime time			0
in this case , @entity4 's age tended to work in his favor ; @entity5 's youth worked against him			1
beyond the matter of gravitas , @entity4 won the debate for a second reason : he managed to put on the table most of the issues that president @entity32 failed to raise in @entity207			1
this was a tricky maneuver , but for the most part @entity4 accomplished his mission			0
this allows @entity32 to hit the reset button for his rematch with @entity46 next week			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity217 .			0
