@entity0 raised eyebrows this month when she compared @entity3 's tactics in @entity4 to those of the @entity6			0
she was right , but there is an even more ominous similarity between the actions of @entity10 and those of pre-war @entity12			1
on may 21 , 1935 , @entity13 delivered his infamous " peace " speech			1
in his masterful history of @entity12 , " @entity21 , " @entity16 quotes the @entity19 's remarks at length : " @entity12 needs peace and desires peace			0
" " @entity12 has solemnly recognized and guaranteed @entity24 her frontiers			0
" " @entity12 has concluded a non-aggression pact with @entity28			0
" @entity16 , a @entity29 correspondent , called the address " one of the cleverest and most misleading of his @entity34 orations this writer , who sat through most of them , ever heard him make			2
" he observed the @entity36 seemed beguiled by the speech , noting the @entity38 welcomed @entity13 's words " with almost hysterical joy			1
" " the speech turns out to be reasonable , straightforward , and comprehensive , " stated the @entity38 editorial			0
" no one who reads it with an impartial mind can doubt that the points of policy laid down by @entity13 may fairly constitute the basis of a complete settlement with @entity12			1
" yet @entity13 was lying to buy time			1
he would not bring peace , but a horrific war , annexing @entity52 , invading @entity24 and @entity28 , and ordering the extermination of six million @entity54			2
indeed , @entity13 's lies were apparent less than a year after the speech			1
on march 7 , 1936 , the @entity6 marched into the @entity57 , the demilitarized zone between @entity12 and @entity24 , in violation of the @entity59			0
if the @entity36 had confronted @entity13 then , it could have forced him out of the @entity57 with a limited application of military force			1
such history is worth noting in today 's showdown with @entity10			1
many in the @entity36 seem beguiled by the @entity66 and president @entity67			2
but are they truly interested in peace , or buying time to build the bomb ? " let me say loud and clear that peace is within reach , " @entity67 told the @entity71 last september			0
" nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction have no place in @entity10 's security and defense doctrine , and contradict our fundamental religious and ethical convictions , " @entity67 added			1
president @entity82 praised @entity67 's " more moderate course , " and the @entity83 called @entity67 " charming			2
" by november 24 , @entity10 had successfully negotiated an interim nuclear deal with the @entity86			1
the deal was widely lauded , especially by @entity10			1
the " @entity89 deal means the surrender of big powers before the great nation of @entity10 , " @entity67 said in january			1
no wonder the @entity10 were so happy : -- sanctions were eased , and " @entity10 was given access to $ 550 million of its assets that are frozen overseas , " noted @entity96			1
" this is the first tranche of the $ 4.2 billion that @entity10 has been promised			2
" -- the interim deal does not require @entity10 to dismantle a single centrifuge or stop enriching uranium to 3.5 %			2
-- @entity101 has 18,000 centrifuges to enrich uranium , and some operate 15 times faster than older models			0
-- after years of work and massive financial investment , @entity10 currently has only enough enriched uranium to run its @entity108 for three months , notes @entity109 of the @entity96			2
-- yet @entity10 now has enough enriched uranium to build six or seven nuclear warheads , @entity109 adds			2
@entity111 want diplomacy to work -- as do we all -- but they worry that if the mullahs obtain a nuclear arsenal , it will be used to kill many			0
in january , we engaged polling firm @entity118 to ask a series of questions of 1,000 likely @entity111 voters			0
among them : " do you agree or disagree with the following statement : ' if the world does not take decisive action , and the @entity10 regime is permitted to build nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them , the @entity10 regime will one day attempt to annihilate the @entity131 and bring about a @entity132 ' ? " a stunning 80 % of @entity111 agreed			1
the world is at a critical moment			0
president @entity82 must insist on a final deal that requires @entity10 to fully dismantle its illegal uranium enrichment capabilities , its heavy water plutonium facility in @entity140 , and its nuclear weapons development efforts			1
the president -- who never should have agreed to ease sanctions -- should also support congressional efforts and declare that if @entity10 refuses to truly give up its nuclear ambitions , then he will sign aggressive new sanctions to be imposed the moment the six - month period of the interim deal is complete			1
what 's more , he should significantly beef up @entity111 forces in the @entity151 , and abandon efforts to slash our @entity153 to @entity156 levels			0
right now , the mullahs do not take @entity82 seriously			0
they do not believe a serious @entity111 military option is really " on the table			0
" the president must make them believe it and restore @entity111 credibility			2
" now you know how you get [ an ] agreement with @entity10 ? " asked @entity131 prime minister @entity165 recently			2
" not by relieving pressure but by adding pressure			0
pressure is what brought @entity10 to the negotiating table in the first place , and only more pressure will get [ them ] to abandon their nuclear weapons program			1
greater pressure on @entity10 will not make war more likely ; it will make war less likely -- because the greater the pressure on @entity10 and more credible the threat of force on @entity10 , the smaller the chance that force will ever have to be used			1
" we can not say force wo n't be needed			0
but @entity165 is right that our last best chance for a peaceful outcome is increased @entity111 pressure and resolve			0
the stakes are too high for anything less			0
join us on @entity194 / @entity193 .			0

@entity196 and @entity197 believe that @entity10 is engaging in the same *deception* as @entity13 did
they say that the president never should have agreed to ease sanctions
greater pressure on @entity10 will make war less likely , they argue
