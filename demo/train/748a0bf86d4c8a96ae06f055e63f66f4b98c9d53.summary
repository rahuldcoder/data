@entity0 , @entity1 -- they came to pay their respects to a young man who saved the lives of many but who lost his own			1
after two days of official mourning , the funeral of @entity10 , the 17 - year - old student who first raised the alarm that his ferry was sinking , was held on sunday			1
his call to emergency services gave rescuers a precious few extra minutes to get to the stricken @entity17 and get passengers off as it is listed dangerously before capsizing and sinking off the coast of @entity1 on the morning of april 15			1
@entity10 made that call at the expense of calling his own parents			1
they never heard from him again			2
" my boy was pure in heart			2
it was probably only nature for him to have called 119 first , " his mother @entity27 said			1
wearing a black mourning hanbok , @entity27 and her husband @entity31 have led a traditional three - day funeral , which ended sunday morning with a service at the @entity35 cathedral			2
hundreds of friends , community leaders and well - wishers passed through the funeral home in the city of @entity0 to offer prayers and to light incense as nuns and friends sang prayers for the departed			0
@entity27 and @entity31 are still trying to come to terms with the loss of their youngest child and only son			0
@entity10 was one of 325 students from @entity51 who boarded the ferry bound for @entity53			1
" he was unusually excited and incredibly happy to be going			0
i was so happy because he was , so i bid him farewell in the morning wishing him a good trip but it ended this way			0
my heart is broken , " @entity27 said			0
on that fateful wednesday morning , emergency services received a call from @entity10 saying that the ferry was sinking			1
it was a full three minutes before the vessel 's crew alerted the emergency services			1
he is being hailed as a hero in @entity1 for saving lives with that call			1
" i was so surprised when i heard about @entity10 making that first call , " his father said			1
" we were wondering why he was not calling us when most of the kids were calling their mums and dads when the accident happened			2
it was not until later when we heard from the media what he had done			0
he has always had leadership qualities			0
now i am very proud of him			0
although he made a sacrifice he saved many lives			1
" their faith helps the pain of such a devastating loss			0
" @entity94 has done many good deeds			0
we believe @entity98 brought @entity10 to this life for this purpose , " his father said			2
as happens so often in tragedies like this , some of the ferry survivors have felt guilty to be alive when so many others are not -- but @entity10 's parents had a poignant message for them			1
" it breaks my heart to think about the suffering that all the children went through			0
my child has gone to heaven but the children who survived must grow up to be adults			2
i want them to overcome the pain and move on and live a full life for their sake and for the sake of the children who did not make it , " said @entity27			0
her husband added : " i am past the point of hating or blaming anyone			0
i hope that we can let that go			0
" the local government has asked the state if @entity10 can be buried at the national cemetery , which honors political and military leaders and citizens who gave their lives to help others			1
his parents say they do n't yet know where his final resting place will be			2
for the next few days his cremated remains will lie at the @entity0 gymnasium , a temporary memorial site , where thousands of local people continue to pay their last respects to the lost sons and daughters of @entity0			0
