the @entity1 @entity0 has opened an investigation into the handling of sexual assault cases at the @entity5 at the request of current and former students , and a former administrator who say the university has long turned a blind eye to such allegations			1
" we love @entity5 , " said @entity12 , the lead complainant			1
" we 're not trying to vilify the university , we 're just trying to make it better			1
" @entity16 and other students named in this report agreed to be identified by @entity19 , which does not typically identify the victims of sexual assault			1
the investigation comes amid outrage on campus and nationwide over intimidation charges filed in the @entity26 , @entity5 , school 's student - run honor court against one of the women involved in the complaint			1
investigators from the @entity0 's @entity33 will look into the women 's allegations that school administrators brushed aside concerns about sexual violence on campus and failed to adequately investigate complaints of sexual assault , according to a march 1 letter sent to @entity16 by the agency			1
in a separate complaint filed with the @entity0 , the women say the school also violated federal laws requiring universities to fully disclose crimes on campus			1
in an e-mailed statement , a @entity5 spokeswoman said the school would cooperate with the investigation			1
school administrators have disputed the cavalier attitude toward sexual assault alleged by the students , noting that @entity5 has removed sexual violence cases from the list of concerns handled by the school 's student - run honor court and appointed an administrator to deal directly with victims			1
" the university cares deeply about all of its students and is committed to providing policies and procedures that are fair for everyone , especially about an issue that is as difficult and often involves strong opinions on both sides like sexual assault , " @entity5 spokeswoman @entity65 said in an e-mailed statement			1
@entity16 began researching sexual assault issues on campus when she realized there was no clear reporting system for sexual violence at the school after she said she was assaulted in 2007			0
@entity16 said she did not know her rapist and she did not report the incident to police			0
" i went to one administrator , and she told me , ' rape is like football			0
and if you look back in the game , would you have done anything differently , ' " @entity16 said			0
three other students , all of whom said they also had been sexually assaulted , joined the complaint , as did an assistant dean for students , @entity97 , who resigned in december			0
as they investigated , @entity16 said they found example after example of the school failing to properly address sexual assault			0
" the university not only had knowledge of actual violations , but they acted with that knowledge to sweep violations under the rug , " she said			2
the tension over sexual violence claims at @entity5 was most recently on display in february , when it became public that honor court charges were being pressed against one of the complainants , @entity115			1
the court 's student prosecutors had earlier declined to proceed with a case alleging honor code violations by @entity122 's ex-boyfriend , whom she had accused of rape			2
@entity122 did not file a sexual assault report with police , and @entity122 's ex-boyfriend -- who has not been identified publicly -- has denied her accusation , according to his attorney , @entity128			2
the man then asked the court to consider intimidation charges against @entity115 , saying her accusations had negatively changed perceptions of him on campus and was making life difficult for him at school			0
in a statement last month , @entity5 chancellor @entity138 said school officials had not encouraged the man to file a case against @entity122			2
" this university works hard to encourage students to come forward and report instances of sexual violence , " @entity138 said in the statement			2
" no student has ever been disciplined for reporting a sexual assault or any honor code violation			2
further , no university administrator filed or encouraged the filing of charges in this case ; there is no retaliation by the university			0
" since the controversy burst into the open , the school has changed its policies to take sexual assault cases out of the honor court 's jurisdiction and has hired an administrator to be the primary contact for sexual assault victims on campus			0
it 's unclear how long the @entity0 investigation might take , but @entity16 said she and the other students expect a " long , difficult , grueling experience			1
" " but it will all be worth it in the long run , " she said			0
another of the complainants , @entity178 , said she hopes the case will spark a change in how all schools respond to complaints of sexual violence among students			0
" i hope that this will serve as a wake - up call to not just @entity5 , but universities across the country , " she said			0
" the time has come for all survivors of sexual violence to demand change and justice			0

students say the @entity5 sweeps sex assault claims under the rug
administrators say they take such claims seriously
the @entity0 will investigate the women 's claims
" we 're not trying to vilify the university *...* just trying to make it better , " one student says
