@entity0 -- nearly two weeks after an explosion aboard an oil rig caused a leak from an undersea oil well off @entity7 , the impact is just beginning to unfold			2
though the widening pool of oil remained offshore monday , it was already a presence for some coastal areas			1
@entity13 , administrator of @entity14 , @entity15 , said he had been able to smell it since friday			0
" i got $ 3 million worth of boats sitting here , " said capt. @entity17 , who ferries tourists from @entity14 to the state 's pristine barrier islands			0
" what am i going to do with them ? " @entity26 's ruptured undersea well continues to spew about 210,000 gallons -- or 5,000 barrels -- of crude per day into the @entity29			1
efforts to contain or curtail the spill have been unsuccessful			2
the sheen extends up to 60 miles across and threatens the coasts of @entity7 , @entity15 and @entity34 , as well as the @entity35 , according to the @entity36			1
that 's an area nearly as large as the state of @entity39			0
the slick was nine miles off the @entity7 coast monday , said adm. @entity42 , commandant of the @entity43 and incident commander			1
@entity26 chief executive @entity45 vowed that the oil giant would " absolutely be paying for the cleanup operation " of the oil leak in the @entity29			1
" where legitimate claims are made , we will be good for them , " he told @entity53 's " @entity52			0
" the @entity55 government was leaving little to chance			0
attorney general @entity57 said monday that @entity59 employees were in the @entity60 " to ensure that @entity26 is held liable			1
" @entity42 said @entity26 " is the responsible party " and " will bear all the costs " of the cleanup			1
still , the promises failed to quell the fears			0
" i hope we can weather the storm , " said @entity66 , owner of seafood market @entity67 's in @entity69 , @entity15			0
@entity72 : @entity73 in @entity15 prepares for oil he said the nature of the current disaster could exact more of a toll on seafood than @entity80 , which savaged the @entity81 in august 2005			2
" we weathered @entity80 , but shrimp after @entity80 was good , " he said			0
" seafood after @entity80 was good			0
with all the oil out there , i do n't know what to expect			2
" in @entity14 , officials worried that a drop in tourism from the slick would chill the city 's @entity94 rebound , which includes half a billion dollars in new construction , $ 30 million of which has been spent on the harbor			1
" this could not have happened at a worse time in our history , " @entity13 , the city 's administrator , said			0
@entity80 left equipment operator @entity104 out of work for a month , but the oil slick could prove worse , he said			1
" the warehouses are empty			0
no trucks , no imports , no exports			0
" " if it threatens the commercial sea lanes , that 's a concern , because if ships do n't come in and ships are n't able to go out , that stops commerce , " said @entity112 , ceo of the @entity113			0
@entity121 : fishermen try to help contain oil slick for now , the harbor is being used as a loading point for hundreds of miles of booms that are intended to defend against the slick 's arrival			1
but the booms may not protect the coast any more than the levees protected @entity131 during @entity80 : rough seas have already broken apart some of the booms			2
@entity133 : @entity134 to save @entity135 meanwhile , @entity35 gov. @entity136 on monday extended a state of emergency to 13 coastal counties in his state and said he might extend it to two more on tuesday			1
he had issued an emergency declaration last week for six counties on the western end of the @entity35 ; monday 's declaration added the rest of the @entity35 , and counties on the @entity81 of the main @entity35 peninsula as far south as @entity148			1
" in the event that the oil does come to our shores , i want us to be ahead of it as much as humanly possible , " he told reporters			2
preparations continue on strategies to stop the leak , though each plan has drawbacks			0
one plan is to lower a dome over the wellhead next week to capture the spewing oil , said @entity35 secretary of environmental protection @entity164			1
" that would stop the flow -- if successful , " he said			0
" unfortunately , it 's never been tried at 5,000 feet below the surface of the water			0
" officials warn of possible catastrophe @entity26 also is having a contractor drill a relief well that would allow workers to plug the first well			1
" unfortunately , that 's a two - to three - month operation , " @entity164 said			0
interior secretary @entity180 , homeland security secretary @entity181 and other @entity184 @entity183 officials met monday afternoon with @entity45 and @entity26 president @entity26 to discuss the response efforts			1
on sunday , federal officials banned fishing for at least 10 days in the northern @entity29 from the mouth of the @entity190 in @entity7 to waters off @entity35 's @entity192			1

officials are fighting the spill on three fronts , @entity209 said monday			1

in @entity221 , @entity7 , @entity184 told reporters sunday that his administration has launched a " relentless response " to the spill , but the problem might not be solved for many days			1
@entity133 : fishermen to help oil cleanup the oil spill started april 20 , after an explosion on @entity26 contractor @entity233 's @entity232 drilling platform left 11 men presumed dead			1

in @entity34 , @entity247 troops helped lay them out off @entity248 , at the southern end of @entity250			0
the cause of the blast remains unknown			0
@entity26 says a device known as a " blowout preventer " failed and has not responded to repeated attempts to activate it using remotely operated submarines			1
how the oil spill crisis could affect @entity26 frustration with @entity26 has been growing across the @entity81 , and @entity7 gov. @entity260 has said the company 's response has been inadequate			1
some 200 vessels , including skimmers , tugboats and nine remotely operated underwater vehicles are on or near the site , @entity26 's chief operating officer @entity263 told reporters			2
@entity26 spokeswoman @entity270 said the company was trying to use the submarines to activate the blowout preventer at the ocean floor and spreading dispersants on and under the water to break up the slick			1
the company has put out about 300,000 feet -- roughly 60 miles -- of floating booms to keep the oil away from ecologically sensitive shorelines , she said			2
but she said efforts to skim oil off the surface were put off because of bad weather			0
" some of the vessels ca n't get out , " she said			0
" but they are still making the effort			0
" @entity1 's @entity289 , @entity290 , @entity291 , @entity292 , @entity293 , @entity294 , @entity295 and @entity296 contributed to this report .			0
