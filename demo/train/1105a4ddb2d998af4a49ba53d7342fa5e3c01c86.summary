-- when @entity2 was born , he weighed just over 2 pounds			0
his tiny , underdeveloped lungs struggled for each breath			0
then doctors in the hospital in @entity7 , @entity8 , put @entity9 on a breathing machine made out of aquarium pumps			1
@entity2 is one of dozens of newborns in the @entity14 country who have survived thanks to the ingenuity of students in a senior design class at @entity20 in @entity21			1
the overall survival rate of babies with respiratory distress at the @entity8 hospital increased from 44 % to 71 % with the use of the students ' breathing machine , according to a recent clinical trial			1
using aquarium pumps , the students have designed a low - cost version of a breathing device called a bubble @entity34 , or @entity34 , machine			1
traditional bubble cpap systems used in developed countries can cost upwards of $ 6,000 ; the students ' machine can be manufactured for around $ 350 , providing big savings for hospitals in poverty - stricken areas			2
@entity8 has the highest rate of preterm birth in the world , 18.1 per 100 live births , according to the @entity48			1
babies born too early often have underdeveloped lungs that do n't inflate easily			2
premature babies struggle to breathe in part because they do n't produce enough lung surfactant , a naturally - produced chemical that keeps the tiny air sacs in the lungs , called alveoli , from collapsing			1
a lot of these babies die because of the stress struggling to breathe puts on their bodies			2
second baby possibly ' cured ' of @entity63 in @entity8 , when a newborn is suffering from respiratory distress , he or she is typically provided extra oxygen via tubes placed gently in the nose			2
but doctors do n't add air pressure to help inflate the infant 's lungs			1
this is the way respiratory distress was treated in newborns , even in developed countries like the @entity77 , until the 1970s			2
with a @entity34 machine , gentle air pressure is pushed via tubes into the nostrils and / or mouth to help facilitate breathing			1
to understand how a bubble @entity34 works , think of a straw that is partially submerged in a glass of water			0
when you blow into the top of the straw , bubbles come out of the bottom of the straw and bubble up			0
" when lungs are underdeveloped , it 's like when you 're blowing up a completely deflated balloon and that first breath to inflate the balloon is really difficult , " said dr. @entity94 of @entity20 , who helped facilitate the design of the students ' bubble @entity34 machine			1
" for a baby with underdeveloped lungs , every breath is like that			0
" doctors and nurses know that it takes very little air pressure to assist newborns			1
the design students found that two aquarium pumps provided the perfect amount of gentle pressure for delicate lungs			1
in the original prototype , the machine was housed in a clear plastic shoebox from @entity122			0
the device 's latest casing box is made from bent sheet metal specifically designed for usability , funcation and durability , said dr. @entity128 of @entity20 , a co-author of the device 's clinical trial along with @entity131			0
" having used bubble @entity34 myself , the ( low - cost aquarium pump ) machine uses the same general principles , " said dr. @entity132 , a neonatal specialist at @entity133 in @entity134 who was not associated with the device 's design			2
" we 've found bubble @entity34 to be very beneficial in infants with respiratory distress			0
... after taking a look at the photos , the low - cost machine does n't seem to be very different			0
" @entity150 , a former student who helped design the low - cost bubble cpap machine , has lived in @entity8 for almost two years			1
she is collaborating with aid organizations and using a transitions grant from @entity154 in hopes of rolling out the device across the country -- first in government hospitals , and then in private and rural hospitals			0
so far , the machines have been implemented in nine government hospitals , she said			0
mysterious cluster of birth defects stumps doctors @entity150 said one major challenge to the rollout in @entity8 is a lack of nurses and physicians ; the high turnover rate makes training difficult			2
" many district hospitals have maybe one doctor , who may not even be a neonatal specialist , " @entity150 said			0
" much of the care is provided by nurses , but one nurse could be taking care of 40 patients at a time			0
" another challenge , @entity150 explained , is that parents in @entity8 are sometimes reluctant to allow the bubble cpap machine to be used , perhaps because nasal tubes and masks used in respiratory therapy are associated with death -- usually , only extremely ill patients receive breathing assistance			1
fortunately , baby @entity2 's family allowed him to receive the respiratory therapy			0
his name , which means " thrown away " in @entity8 's @entity192 language , was chosen by his grandmother			2
she feared he had been thrown away by @entity194 , as she did n't expect him to survive			0
but with the help of a breathing machine made of aquarium pumps , @entity2 is now a healthy , thriving 7 - month - old baby .			1

college students create a breathing machine from aquarium pumps
the machine has helped dozens of newborns in @entity8 survive
@entity8 has the world 's highest rate of preterm births per 100 births
the machines provide gentle air pressure to help babies breathe
