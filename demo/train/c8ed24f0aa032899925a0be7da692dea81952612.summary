-- even when @entity2 held a nine - point lead over @entity4 atop @entity7 football 's @entity5 , @entity2 boss @entity1 always maintained his team was n't the favorite			1
he is being proved right -- with saturday not helping the @entity10			0
@entity2 suffered a shock 1 - 0 loss at relegation threatened @entity14 and hours later saw @entity4 gain a point thanks to a 1 - 1 draw at @entity17			1
it might have been worse for @entity2 , since @entity4 led 1 - 0			1
" i think it is now impossible to win the title , " @entity1 told @entity18 before the @entity4 game			2
" we depend too much on other results			0
" @entity2 still leads the standings by a point over @entity26 and two over @entity4 but @entity4 has two games in hand and @entity26 will go top if it earns a point sunday at home against @entity33			1
@entity4 , fresh off a convincing victory in the @entity36 derby , took a deserved lead in @entity38 in the 18th minute when @entity39 was the quickest to react after @entity41 's left - footed shot struck the post			2
@entity17 appeared listless , perhaps the result of losing 6 - 0 at @entity2 last week and then dropping more points against @entity45			1
but the @entity46 were a different side in the second half , leveling through defensive midfielder @entity49 in the 53rd			0
and @entity17 almost took the lead , @entity52 stopping @entity53 with @entity4 creaking			1
in the end @entity4 seemed happy to take a point judging by manager @entity58 's substitutions			2
" we played better in the first half , " @entity58 told @entity18			0
although @entity2 tallied more than 20 shots , only two were on goal and none managed to beat keeper @entity65			0
@entity65 twice thwarted @entity2 's offensive star , @entity66			0
@entity67 , so solid for @entity2 this season , gave @entity14 a valuable three points with an own goal in the 52nd minute			1
@entity1 did n't blame @entity67 and in fact praised his four main defenders as a whole			0
however , he added : " you have other players who are fantastic in some matches and disappear in other matches			0
" @entity78 has struggled in its first season under @entity80 but there were boos when a banner flew above @entity84 calling for the @entity86 's departure			0
@entity87 -- a week after his wonder goal from the halfway mark against @entity90 -- scored twice in @entity78 's 4 - 1 lunchtime win over @entity92			2
@entity87 was substituted in the second half , days ahead of @entity78 's @entity95 quarterfinal against title holder @entity96			0
elsewhere , @entity7 trio @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 shone for @entity101 again in a 4 - 0 home win against @entity103 ; and relegation contenders @entity104 and @entity106 played to a 3 - 3 draw after both scored deep in injury time			1
@entity110 and @entity45 further eased their relegation worries by defeating @entity112 1 - 0 and @entity113 3 - 0 , respectively .			1

@entity2 suffers a shock 1 - 0 loss at relegation threatened @entity14
@entity4 gains a point by tying @entity17 1 - 1 in the late kickoff
@entity2 leads @entity26 by a point and city by two atop the table
@entity26 will go top of the @entity5 with a draw sunday
