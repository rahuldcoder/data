-- the cruise line @entity2 says it was an " aberration " when inspectors from the @entity4 found multiple sanitation violations , including brown liquid dripping on clean dishes and a fly on the buffet , on the line 's ms @entity12			1
enough violations were cited that the @entity4 gave the @entity14 a failing grade			1
" while unacceptable for @entity2 , the unsatisfactory score is highly unusual and an aberration , " @entity2 's @entity16 told @entity0			1
inspectors do n't tell cruise lines when they 're going to show up , but they visit twice a year as part of the @entity4 's vessel sanitation inspection program			1
the @entity4 grades ships on a 100 - point scale			1
an 85 or lower is considered a failing grade			2
the @entity14 received a grade of 77			2
" since 1996 , @entity14 has received passing scores on 32 inspections , " @entity16 said			0
the @entity14 is a 16 - year - old ship , originally christened by actress @entity30 , that carries 1,930 passengers and crew , according to @entity2			1
does traveling increase your chance of illness ? according to the @entity4 report , during the august 19 surprise visit , inspectors found brown liquid dripping on clean dishes , refrigerators out of order , improper installation of anti-entrapment drain covers in pools posing a possible danger to swimmers , faulty dishwashers that managers allegedly failed to do anything about until inspectors arrived and water from a broken ice machine leaking onto the pool deck			2
the report did not specify what the brown liquid dripping on dishes was , or where it came from			0
" one of the cooks doing active food preparation had a goatee and was not wearing a beard restraint , " a @entity4 inspector noted			0
later in the same report , " a live large fly was near the buffet			0
this area was in use during the inspection , " the @entity4 said			0
the @entity73 's failing grade is uncommon in the cruise ship industry , an industry that has tried in recent years to keep on - board environments sanitary after illnesses like the @entity79 virus sickened passengers and caused a public relations nightmare			1
@entity4 's surprise cruise ship inspection ( video ) " very few ships have received a failing score over the last couple of years , " the @entity4 's @entity84 said			1
in fact , only five ships since 2007 have failed inspection during the @entity4 's bi-annual unannounced inspections			1
ships are required to take corrective action after inspectors find violations			0
all cruise ships that dock at @entity98 ports are inspected by the @entity4			2
reports are then posted on the @entity4 's website			1
it 's the second time in as many months that @entity2 ships have been targeted by officials			2
in august , a room tag from the line 's @entity106 cruise ship and sewage washed ashore in @entity109 , @entity110 , leading town officials to suggest the debris may have come from the ship			2
but @entity2 now says its investigation suggests the debris did n't come from their ship			0
" a detailed letter outlining specifics related to the individual pieces of trash that washed up was sent to local authorities in mid-august and follow up was done with the @entity123 as well			0
in general , the items found are not items carried onboard the ship			0
as for the luggage tag that was found , that particular color / style had not been used by @entity2 for a year , " @entity16 said			0
