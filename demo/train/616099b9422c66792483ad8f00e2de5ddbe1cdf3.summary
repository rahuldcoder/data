-- if you 've ever pretended to be talking on your cell phone to avoid talking to , or acknowledging , someone nearby -- you 're not alone			1
one in 13 @entity5 have used this ploy , a new survey says			0
in its report , the @entity7 also explores the pros and cons of having a cell phone			1
cell phones are great for quick information retrieval , @entity7 found			2
but not having fast mobile access to info can cause problems			1
" half of all adult cell owners ( 51 % ) had used their phone at least once to get information they needed right away , " the report said			2
" one quarter ( 27 % ) said that they experienced a situation in the previous month in which they had trouble doing something because they did not have their phone at hand			0
" among cell phone users ages 18 - 29 , 42 % reported experiencing trouble doing something because their phone was n't nearby			1
it 's no surprise that the survey found cell phones prove handy in emergencies			0
it said that 40 % of cell owners " said they found themselves in an emergency situation in which having their phone with them helped			2
" and smartphones ' growing rep as a tool for killing time ? more than 40 % of all cell owners entertain themselves with their phone when bored			2
( for users 18 - 29 , that 's 70 %			0
) at the same time , the report found that cell phones can frustrate users			0
according to @entity7 , 20 % of cell owners " experienced frustration because their phone was taking too long to download something ; 16 % had difficulty reading something on their phone because the screen was too small ; and 10 % had difficulty entering a lot of text on their phone			1
" despite the vast amount of media attention given to on - the - go social media , @entity7 found that more cell phone owners use mobile e-mail ( 38 % ) than mobile social media ( 29 % )			1
this echoes earlier findings from @entity77 and from @entity78 , which found this year that mobile e-mail use has been growing			2
@entity7 's survey of nearly 2,800 @entity5 adults also highlighted some differences in how people use smartphones vs. simpler feature phones			2
some context : earlier @entity7 found that 35 % of all adult @entity5 cell - phone users own smartphones , so less - smart " feature phones " remain the largest part of the mobile market by far			1
how many cell phones are we talking about ? according to @entity78 , as of june there were 234 million @entity5 cell - phone subscribers 13 and older , and about 33 % of these were smartphone owners			1
this slight discrepancy with @entity7 's estimate of smartphone ownership might be attributable to teens , who have less disposable income and thus may be more likely to use inexpensive feature phones			0
@entity7 's earlier study also acknowledged the difficulty in distinguishing between smartphones and feature phones in a user survey since this technological line is blurring and since users often incorrectly identify which type of phone they have			1
according to the latest @entity7 report , 92 % of smartphone owners ( but only 59 % of feature phone owners ) said they send or receive text messages and use their phones to take photos			1
sharing images is less popular -- 80 % of smartphone users and 36 % of feature phone users have used their phones to send photos or videos to others			0
also , 84 % of smartphone users report using their phone to access the @entity128 , compared with just 15 % of feature phone users			2
apps are interesting : why get a smartphone if you 're not going to use apps ? however , @entity7 found that 30 % of smartphone owners have not downloaded apps			1
it 's likely that many of these are @entity139 users , a still - popular smartphone platform with a comparatively sparse app ecosystem			0
however , i 've personally been surprised to encounter several @entity144 users who never download apps -- and who rarely use stock @entity144 apps aside from @entity149 and @entity150			0
meanwhile , 4 % of feature phone users have downloaded apps			1
that may sound paltry , but that 's about 6 million people			0
( yes , most feature phones can run simple apps based on the @entity159 programming language			0
) as the line between feature phones and smartphones continues to blur , apps and the mobile web on feature phones may become a more important part of the mobile landscape			0
since feature phones tend to cost much less than smartphones , and since in the @entity5 , it 's harder to get smartphones that do n't require a pricey two - year carrier contract , it 's unlikely that feature phones will vanish entirely anytime soon .			0
