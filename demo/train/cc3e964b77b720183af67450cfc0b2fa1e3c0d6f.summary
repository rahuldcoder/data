an @entity1 video showing the horrific killing of a @entity4 air force pilot has stoked anger in the @entity8 kingdom and left analysts wondering what impact it will have on the @entity12 - led coalition fighting the militant group			1
@entity4 already carried out one act of retaliation , executing two terrorist prisoners with ties to @entity18 in @entity19			1
one of them was @entity21 , the would - be suicide bomber whose release @entity1 had demanded			2
protesters gathered in the streets of the @entity4 capital , @entity25 , and in the home town of the pilot , @entity28			1
but what will @entity1 and @entity4 do next ? " i think there 's likely to be a backlash , particularly in @entity4 , " said @entity30 , a @entity5 terrorism analyst			1
" i think it 's sort of going to rally support for @entity35 and his participation in the @entity38 coalition			2
" but it 's unclear whether @entity1 leaders are bothered by the condemnation and outrage			1
" @entity1 does n't really care very much about the reactions it gets from @entity8 or foreign governments , " said @entity43 , a @entity44 analyst based in @entity45			1
" they 're on a mission to carry out their barbaric deed			0
" anger against @entity1 was in evidence among protesters in @entity4			1
one demonstrator held a poster that read : " they burned our hearts , so let 's burn their dens , and their prisoners in our prisons			0
" some experts expressed puzzlement at @entity1 ' decision to kill the pilot without getting anything in return			1
" this pilot was a real bargaining chip , " said retired lt. col. @entity71 , a @entity12 @entity72 veteran intelligence officer			0
" the @entity4 were willing to do things to get him back			2
he comes from a very established family , one that supports the @entity4 monarchy			2
i 'm not sure they realized exactly who they had			0
" adding to the intrigue , @entity4 authorities said they believed the pilot had been killed as early as january 3 , before @entity1 made any demands for the release of @entity89 by @entity4			1
if that 's the case , the recent @entity1 threats against the life of @entity28 appear to aimed at publicity rather than serious negotiations			1
@entity1 is known to still be holding at least two @entity96 hostages : @entity97 , a @entity99 journalist who has appeared in a number of @entity1 - produced videos , and an @entity12 woman who is a 26 - year - old aid worker			2
analysts said they thought it was unlikely that @entity4 's hanging of the two jihadist prisoners wednesday would affect @entity1 ' next moves			1
" i do n't see that the execution of these two individuals is really going to change their calculus much , " said @entity71			0
" they 're going to do whatever they want to do			0
" " i do n't think they had much invested in either the woman or the man who were just hanged , " he said			0
" they were nice bargaining chips that they could try and do something with			0
" the video of the killing of the @entity4 pilot , showing a new level of brutality even by @entity1 ' grim standards , raises the question of whom they are trying to reach			1
" there are some people out there attracted to these horrific videos , " said @entity5 political commentator @entity129			0
" but a much , much larger group of people in the @entity137 and @entity8 world are absolutely repulsed			0
" @entity138 , a former extremist , said he believes that @entity1 is n't trying to reach the majority but is going after existing terrorists as it competes with @entity18 for foreign recruits			2
" this is a race to the bottom when it comes to the gruesome depictions that they 're showing , " said @entity138 , the author of " radical : my journey out of @entity150			0
" @entity151 , a former @entity12 deputy national security adviser , said he thinks that with the pilot video , @entity1 is trying to send a message to the @entity8 members of the coalition against it			1
" they 're going to be treated brutally , and in fact , maybe perhaps more brutally than other members of the coalition , " he told @entity5			0
at the end of the video , @entity1 shows names and addresses of people whom it claims are @entity4 pilots			1
a reward is offered , and a voice says they are " wanted dead			0
" the timing of @entity1 ' recent string of videos -- showing the deaths of two @entity174 hostages and now @entity28 -- may also be significant , according to @entity175 of the @entity176			2
he suggested it could be an effort to distract attention from the militant group 's " humiliating defeat " by the @entity182 in the @entity184 city of @entity185			0
the news of the killing of the pilot sparked protests in the streets of @entity25 , the capital , and in the pilot 's hometown			1
the focus of the people 's ire was @entity1			1
analysts said they expected most of the population to stand behind the government			0
" the @entity4 people , i think , very clearly will unite behind the government , " said @entity43 , a senior fellow at the @entity199			1
" the trick is for the government to figure out what is the most appropriate response now			0
" the government 's early retaliation was to carry out the hangings of the two jihadist prisoners			1
but the pilot 's father suggested that was far from enough			1
" those criminals can not be compared to @entity28 , " @entity28 's father , @entity212 , said wednesday			0
" @entity28 's blood is much more valued than these two prisoners			0
" he called on the @entity4 government to execute all prisoners with links to @entity1			1
" annihilate this organization , " he said			0
a @entity4 government spokesman on tuesday promised an " earthshaking retaliation " for the killing of the pilot			1
but it still remains very unclear what form that might take			0
some military experts speculated that @entity4 could launch independent airstrikes against @entity1 or move artillery and other weapons to the border near @entity1 - controlled territory			1
but other analysts said they thought that unilateral action was unlikely			0
" they know that it would be foolhardy to launch an attack without being part of the coalition			0
he said he expected more commitment to the coalition from @entity4 , including perhaps greater access to its airbases and an increased number of @entity4 sorties			2
" when @entity4 commits , @entity4 can be a real force			2
but @entity4 ca n't do this alone , " he said			2
@entity5 military analyst @entity248 said he expected @entity4 to increase intelligence sharing with the coalition and possibly put some additional defenses along the borders with @entity184 and @entity19			1
" this is a calm , measured leader who wants to do things the right way , " he said of @entity35			0
a key question is how the @entity4 population 's views on the @entity12 - led airstrikes against @entity1 will develop over time			1
for the time being , the anger and desire for revenge appear to be directed against @entity1			2
but before the pilot 's killing was announced , some @entity4 had been questioning the government 's decision to take part in the @entity271 coalition			1
" we 're going to have to see what happens after this period of mourning and anger is over , " said @entity5 's @entity272 in @entity25			0
" what sort of calls are we going to be hearing from the @entity4 street ? " the issue is complex in a country like @entity4 , according to @entity43			2
" you get situations where many @entity285 -- they do n't support @entity1 -- but they do n't like foreign armies coming to attack @entity285 , " he told @entity5			2
" no doubt that the majority , especially in @entity4 , are afraid of @entity1 and want to fight it and want to defeat it , " @entity43 said			1
" but there are tensions because many , many people instinctively in the @entity8 world are hesitant to join an @entity12 - led military assault against @entity8 parties			0
" @entity5 's @entity295 contributed to this report .			0

" i think there 's likely to be a backlash " against @entity1 , analyst says
@entity4 's government has vowed an " earthshaking retaliation " for the pilot 's killing
but experts say @entity4 is unlikely to take independent military action against @entity1
