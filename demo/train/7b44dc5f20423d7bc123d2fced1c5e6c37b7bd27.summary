-- what a crapfest ! the judges did end up using their save this week			1
before @entity5 could make it through a single verse of " nobody 's supposed to be here , " tangerine dream @entity3 had stormed the stage			1
" gim me that mic ! " she snapped			2
" shall we dance ? " she continued			2
" why did n't all you b * * * * * * watch @entity13 ! ? " @entity14 stepped in			2
" we are saving @entity5 without any doubt , " he announced			1
" this girl is one of the best singers in @entity18			2
are you kidding me ? everybody please vote for the best			2
" " are you kidding me ? " said the sparkly tongue - sticking - out emoticon pin on @entity14 's lapel			2
" let the people do what they want			2
< 3 < 3 < 3			0
" ugh , it was all so staged ! to make matters worse , we 'd already been warned that this charade was about to happen			0
" we 're gon na use our card tonight , especially with an outcome like this , " @entity30 had assured @entity31 once the shocking bottom three -- @entity5 , @entity36 , and @entity37 -- had been announced			1
could have used a spoiler alert there @entity30 ! that tinkling sound you hear behind you is bits of evil gargoyle overlord @entity44 's granite teeth crumbling to the floor from over-clenching			0
anyway , the judges saved @entity5			1
@entity48 carried on his annual tradition of separating the top and bottom three contestants and then making the only officially " safe " person -- @entity54 -- " pick the group you think you belong with			1
" @entity54 promptly marched over to the couches and refused , but @entity31 's meaty grip got her in the end			0
turned out @entity58 , @entity59 , and @entity60 were safe this week			1
@entity61 had predicted @entity58 , @entity59 , and @entity37 for the bottom three			1
after @entity36 and @entity5 landed there instead , @entity61 growled , " i 'm gon na get a new flat - screen			1
" so you can ... see everyone better ? great plan			0
best wishes to @entity69 the crab on his continued wealth			0
@entity72 -- that mythical creature with the tail from season 10 -- returned with blonde ambition to scream " @entity79 , " off his debut album @entity78			0
i thought i was high myself when they kept randomly zooming in on his drummer 's feet			0
this time the cloth dangling from the @entity87 's butt was white , possibly as a metaphor for the diapers he can now afford to purchase for his baby			0
good looking out ! i kept worrying that @entity100 's " before weight " hologram from the @entity94 commercials would creep into the frame and try to duet with her on " @entity98 , " but luckily @entity99 did instead			1
does anyone not love @entity99 ? i kept obsessing over this during their performance filled with push - and - pull flirting and plenty of sass appeal			1
i think he is universally adored			0
i even ended up marveling that the " design " on his white t - shirt was just a big black rectangle			0
that 's genius , i thought , genuinely			0
@entity99 's got ta have it , @entity31 ! hopefully no one was home or visiting or peering at you through a hidden camera as you watched the @entity120 7 's " @entity121 " abomination			1
i actually apologized to my recapping buddy @entity122 out of secondhand embarrassment			0
two visual moments did save these dirty little freaks from complete failure , though : @entity59 gently caressing @entity60 's hair - animal in his lap ( ? ! ) and a final pose featuring an off - balance @entity48 clutching a @entity132 cup ( ! ! )			1
can you believe @entity5 received the lowest amount of votes ? was this @entity3 's best acting performance since " @entity139 " ? was @entity60 totally channeling @entity140 as he cautiously opened that wooden box from a prospective prom date ? separate your thoughts into two groups and pick a side in the comments ! see the full article at @entity0			1
