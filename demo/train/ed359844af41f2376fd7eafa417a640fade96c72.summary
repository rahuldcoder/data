@entity0 -- a police officer in @entity5 , @entity6 , whom an attorney accuses of brutality in the death of a homeless man this summer and two arrest cases last year , has been placed on paid leave , a police spokesman announced friday			1
sgt. @entity14 identified the officer as @entity16 , but he declined to confirm whether @entity17 is among six officers involved in the arrest of @entity20 , a 37 - year - old homeless man who died five days after allegedly being beaten by police this summer			1
that death is under investigation by the @entity24 and the @entity26 district attorney			2
but @entity16 was involved in two incidents last year in which two men are accusing @entity16 of brutality and false arrest , @entity14 told @entity1			1
" i ca n't comment as to the type of leave or the reason or the length , " @entity14 said of @entity16 being placed on paid leave			1
in making the announcement friday , @entity14 declined to state when the leave became effective			2
@entity16 and his attorney could n't immediately be reached for comment friday			1
@entity14 confirmed that @entity16 was the officer involved in a new allegation of brutality made friday by @entity42 , 27 , of @entity43 , @entity6 , who is planning to file a lawsuit against @entity16 for " slamming " his head against a wall in a june 27 , 2010 , incident			1
his attorney , @entity48 , who 's also the lawyer in the two other alleged brutality cases , announced the plans in a press conference friday			1
@entity5 police investigated a police misconduct complaint filed by @entity42 shortly after the arrest , @entity14 said			2
" that complaint was investigated , and there was a disposition on the complaint , and i ca n't talk about the disposition , " @entity14 said			0
@entity42 's case marked the third case of alleged brutality by the @entity5 police			2
those three accusations emerged this summer in the wake of the death of @entity20 , a homeless man who was diagnosed as a schizophrenic			1
@entity42 accused @entity16 of assaulting him and falsely accusing him of being drunk in public , said @entity48			1
coincidentally , @entity42 happened to be one of about 100 witnesses to the police struggle with @entity20 and even saw @entity16 's involvement in that incident , @entity42 said			1
@entity42 was interviewed by prosecutors investigating the homeless man 's death , his attorney said			1
in the 2010 incident , the officer was writing a ticket to a motorist for bouncing his lowrider and displaying its hydraulics as @entity42 happened to be on the sidewalk , waiting outside a bar , @entity42 told reporters friday			2
the officer told @entity42 not to interfere with the investigation , and @entity42 then responded : " get away from me because cops killed my dad , " who was shot to death by @entity93 , @entity6 , police on september 1 , 2008 , @entity42 said			1
that remark was apparently interpreted by the officer as " contempt of cops , " @entity48 said			0
the @entity5 officer then arrested @entity42 and slammed his head against the wall , @entity42 said			2
a blood test later showed that @entity42 had no alcohol in his system at the time of the arrest , he and his attorney said			2
@entity42 filed a police misconduct complaint just days after the incident , but he said he did n't know if anything ever became of the complaint , though he made several follow - up phone calls			1
" as it says on the side of the patrol car , they are there to serve and protect us , not harass us , " @entity42 said			0
" he acted out of the heat of passion by throwing that charge at me , which was very unethical for him to have done , to take his personal issues out on me			0
" he threw handcuffs on me and he slammed my head up against the wall , and he applied pressure to my head , which made my head hurt worse , " @entity42 said			0
the officer spoke in " like a sarcastic tone when i asked him what i was going to jail for , and he laughed and said , ' drunk in public			0
' he had to think about it			0
" the other two instances of alleged police brutality occurred after @entity42 's complaint , he said			2
" if they would have taken care of the matter when i filed the complaint , then this would n't have happened , " @entity42 told reporters , referring to the two other alleged instances of brutality			0
during the press conference , @entity42 was seated next to another alleged victim of police misconduct , @entity149 , who is suing the @entity5 police for an incident that occurred four months after @entity42 's experience			0
added @entity149 : " if ( @entity5 police ) would have taken action on ( @entity42 's ) behalf , i probably would n't be in this mess , and mr. @entity20 would n't have passed away			1
" @entity48 , who 's the attorney representing the alleged victims in all three instances , said the cases show " a pattern " of police misconduct			1
" we need to identify rogue cops and get them off the street			0
these few bad apples give the entire department a bad name , " he said			0
in the @entity20 incident on july 5 , @entity42 happened to witness police " beating on @entity20 " as @entity42 was boarding his bicycle on a bus near the altercation , he said			1
@entity42 said he heard @entity20 crying for his father , @entity173 , who also was at friday 's press conference			1
as he witnessed the encounter between police and @entity20 , @entity42 saw the same officer from his arrest " walking up , and that 's when the whole beating process started " in the @entity20 arrest , @entity42 said			1
the officer was also allegedly involved in a third case of suspected police brutality last year in which @entity149 , 31 , of @entity185 , @entity6 , has filed a civil lawsuit against @entity5 police , said @entity48			1
@entity149 's altercation with @entity5 police officers was recorded on his @entity191 and posted on @entity192			0
@entity149 was n't seriously injured , @entity48 said			0
during the early morning hours of october 23 , 2010 , @entity149 was recording the arrest of a friend on his @entity191 camera			0
