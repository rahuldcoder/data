-- we 've been nearing the end of the late - fees era for years -- and , thanks to technology , we 're one step closer this week			1
@entity7 just launched a no - fees library loan program for digital books			1
this shift actually started more than a decade ago with the dvd - rental business			0
or , more specifically , when @entity12 , now the ceo of @entity13 ( er , @entity12 ? ) , forgot to return a copy of the movie " @entity16 " for six weeks and racked up a $ 40 late fee from a video - rental store			1
that inspired his dvd - by - mail service , according to a 2006 essay in the @entity22 , in which customers pay a monthly fee for the privilege to leave " @entity28 " under their couches for as long as they 'd like without financial penalty			0
ba - da - bing			0
( customers still gripe about @entity13 's prices , though )			0
now , books are the next frontier			0
sure , there have been previous no - tech attempts to waive library fees			1
some book - loaners have programs called " @entity40 , " in which good - willed librarians let anyone return an overdue book -- no questions asked			2
last year , someone brought a 35 - years - overdue book back to a library during one of these events			2
the fine otherwise would have been $ 1,400 , according to @entity51			0
in other cases , the fees to be charged were so hefty that libraries just decide to give up			1
in @entity56 , @entity55 returned a 78 - years - overdue copy of a @entity59 book , according to a 2005 story in the @entity61			2
" stunned library officials agreed to waive the late fees , " the paper says , " which under the 1927 rate of 2 cents per day would have amounted to more than $ 550 by now			1
" digital books allow for a different approach			0
instead of charging owners for overdue e-books , the files just lock up on the borrower 's e-book reader or smartphone			1
" e-books automatically expire , " said @entity74 , a spokesman for a company called @entity76 , which is managing this library book - loaning program for @entity7 and has apps that work for other e-reading platforms			1
" so that definitely is a benefit from borrowing e-books			2
and you do n't have to go back and forth to the library			0
you can do it remotely			0
" that 's good for forgetful types , who can stash books away from weeks or decades before remembering they 've borrowed them			0
and it 's good for libraries , too , since they can loan these books out again right away -- rather than waiting for them to be returned			2
" it 's fantastic , " said @entity96 , director of the @entity98 's program on public access to information			2
the fact that libraries do n't charge late fees on overdue e-books is n't a big deal , she said			1
" having been a librarian , the libraries do n't really rely on late fees as a big budget boost , " she said			1
it does n't matter to us if we do n't collect late fees			1
we 'd rather the information gets out to people			0
" most digital book " rentals " last for two weeks			2
libraries purchases a certain number of licenses for the digital books , and then lend those out to patrons			1
so it 's not like the library can loan out 1,000 copies of " @entity125 " just because that book is popular			0
that 's a good start , but is based on the " print model , " @entity127 said			0
in the future , she expects new " @entity13 models " for books to emerge , where libraries pay monthly fees to publishers , perhaps , and can lend out as many copies of a book as their patrons would like			1
@entity7 is in talks to do that for consumers , according to @entity145			0
" customers would pay an annual fee to access a library of content " under the potential plan , that paper says			0
the @entity7 program is the largest so far , with 11,000 libraries participating , all of those in the @entity155 only			1
that sounds like a lot , but it 's only 9 % of the libraries in the country , according to data from the @entity98			2
the rest of the country may have to keep sweating overdue book fees			1
but perhaps not for too much longer .			0

new program lets libraries lend e-books to @entity170 users
11,000 libraries in the @entity155 participate
there are no late fees for the e-book rentals , but the files lock when they 're overdue
@entity179 has *slowly* been *whittling* away at the idea of late fees
