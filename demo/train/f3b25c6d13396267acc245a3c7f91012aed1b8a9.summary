@entity0 , @entity1 -- take a pen , start with the nib at the bottom left corner of the page			2
gently drag the pen diagonally from bottom left to top right and you have a quick and easy graphic representation of the price differential between the standard @entity12 and its habañero cousin the @entity15 coupe over the last four generations ( and 20 years )			1
@entity18 exhaust pipes and m - badging distinguish the @entity15 from standard 3 - series coupes the car in my hands is , supposedly , a 3 - series			1
you know the 3 - series			1
you may well own one			2
you almost certainly know someone who owns one			2
it is the ubiquity of the 3 - series that has seen @entity12 become a more mainstream player ( without making an obvious lurch down - market ) while the mainstream has made an obvious lurch up - market to plug the gap			1
@entity40 's new mondeo could n't be clearer in its 3 - series aspiration			1
but this latest @entity15 has substantially less in common with the vanilla 3 - series than i have with a gorilla ( 98.4 per cent shared dna )			1
eighty per cent of the @entity15 's body panels are brand new , from the aluminum hood to the composite fenders and carbon - fiber reinforced plastic roof			1
and let 's get back to that graph			2
this @entity54 - specification car costs £ 50,000 ( € 74,000 )			1
with the options as tested ( including the gorgeous 19 " alloy wheels , one of which i pranged on a curb while rectifying a going - the - wrong - way - down - a - one - way - street maneuver -- i 'm blaming the co-driver for this navigational error , and so should you ) we 're talking close to £ 55,000 ( € 81,000 )			1
it looks purposeful and aggressive and more -- what 's the word -- obvious than its @entity15 predecessors , with the engorged dome on the hood to accommodate the 4 - liter @entity72 and the @entity74 - like side air - intakes with integrated side - light repeaters and @entity15 badging			1
but it still looks like a pumped - up family car rather than a purpose - built sports car ( though it sits between @entity82 's @entity81 in price )			1
it may just be possible to buy one and pretend to one 's spouse that it 's a sensible family car -- providing , that is , that the 22.8 mpg ( 12.4 liters per 100 km ) combined fuel economy ( and the regularity of trips to the gas station this necessitates ) does n't give the game away			2
inside it 's typical @entity12 -- leather seats that adjust to accommodate any driver ( including those such as me who are short of body but long of leg ) and a chunky leather steering wheel stitched with the cyan , blue and scarlet colors of @entity12 's m division			0
on the road the @entity15 is -- simply -- lovely			1
over 20 years @entity12 's m cars have evolved from homologation specials ( road car versions of track racers ) to sedate luxury saloons that can transfer themselves into sporting monsters			0
some earlier enthusiastic driving from my co-driver made it necessary to drive slowly , in sixth gear , behind the slipstream of a motor home to conserve fuel while on a desperate hunt for a gas station			0
in some sports cars this would require skill and dedication			0
not so in the @entity15 , it drives however you want to drive			1
it can pootle as competently as it can hustle			0
and boy can it hustle			0
when questioned later that day , a @entity12 spokesman denied any knowledge of the cars having had their limiters disabled			0
but i can state that i was passenger in a car that supposedly tops out at 155 mph ( 200 km / h ) at a staggering 176 mph ( 283 km / h )			0
the question of whether this delimited limiter is an " undocumented feature " or a manufacturer 's attempt to woo motoring journalists with a set - up that is n't representative of the sale car , will only be resolved once the first customers take delivery of their new @entity153			2
there is , of course , more to the @entity15 than flat - out speed on the straight			1
it 's a car that allows drivers a turn of speed on twisty roads with confidence and sure - footedness			2
you can take corners faster , without fear of picking gorse from your teeth			0
take a corner a little over enthusiastically and there 's a comforting orange light on the dash to tell you that the @entity174 ( dynamic stability control ) has kicked in			0
when the @entity174 is engaged flatters the abilities of average drivers			0
disengaged it allows skillful drivers an awful lot of wheel - spinning sideways action , as i discovered while given a few hectic laps of the @entity186 - @entity185 circuit in the hands of a pro. what 's wrong with it ? in common with the @entity192 and @entity193 there 's the frustrating short indicator stalk that always clicks three times , even if you try and cancel it ( and in an effort of trying to switch the right indicator off you inevitably find yourself signaling left and vice versa )			2
there seems to be no substantial difference between fifth and six gears			0
you engage the clutch , throw the lever and -- well , nothing much			0
but then you really start struggling to find fault			0
the cup holders do n't have an elegant glide and the driver 's one is n't as accessible as it could be			0
while the electric thingum that extends telescopically to hand you the seat belt looks cheap			0
cup holder aficionados and those who demand milled - aluminum electric hand - me - my - belt thingums may have to look elsewhere			2
incidentally , @entity12 do have a name for the electric thingums			0
just as i prefer the term " paddle shifts " to " @entity229 " -- another minor grumble -- paddles shifts would be a welcome option , and one that @entity12 assured the assembled press would be added as an option in the future			0
@entity12 estimates that @entity15 buyers will be predominantly male and aged 31 - 50			1
they will own a number of high performance cars but use the @entity15 as their everyday conveyance			1
in the light of this market research , the most obvious criticism of the new @entity15 -- its price -- is something of an irrelevance			1

fourth generation @entity15 coupe
power from *420bhp* *v8* engine
target market 31 - 50 year old males in *multi-automobile* households
