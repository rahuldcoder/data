-- authorities have identified three of the four women found dead this month in two incidents in @entity5 , an investigator with the @entity9 medical examiner 's @entity7 said friday			1
three of the women have been linked to a website that accepts ads for escort services , police have said			1
in the latest case , one of the two women found early @entity19 in the trunk of a car that had been set afire was identified as @entity22 , 28 , the investigator said			1
the second victim remains unidentified , said the investigator , who asked not to be identified because he is not allowed to speak on the record to the news media			1
the bodies of two other women found december 19 have been identified as @entity28 , 24 , and @entity29 , 23			1
they were found in the trunk of @entity29 ' @entity32			1
causes of death for the four women were pending toxicology results , which typically take six to eight weeks to be completed , the investigator said			2
the process of identification can be difficult			0
" people hear of someone that is discovered that we bring down here and they call down here and inform us that someone is missing , " the investigator said			0
" they give us a description and then they come down if they can be viewed and are recognizable			0
if not , we ask them to bring a set of dental records for comparison			0
" the deaths are being treated as the work of one person or group of people , @entity5 's police chief said tuesday			2
" at this point , we are working it as one case or one suspect or set of suspects , " chief @entity57 told @entity0			0
" there are too many common links for us not to , at this point , work this as one single investigation			0
" among those links , he said , is the fact that three of the women had placed online ads dealing with " prearranged adult dating services " and posted on @entity76 , @entity57 told reporters monday			1
" we felt it is imperative to alert the public that deciding to meet unknown persons via the @entity80 can be extremely dangerous , " @entity57 said			0
but a lawyer for backpage.com , @entity83 , said it was not clear that his company 's website was involved			1
" our team has already provided the police with detailed information about the ads that the suspect or others posted on numerous web sites			2
law enforcement authorities now have evidence that the investigation appears to connect to at least 30 different ads or other postings on at least 15 different websites , separate and distinct from ours , " @entity83 said			2
" we are not aware of the existence of any evidence that would indicate which of these many sites were used by the suspect to establish contact with his victims			0
" @entity76 representatives have been cooperating with police , the police chief said			0
postings on the escort section of the website cost $ 1			1
referring to the advertisements on the website as " borderline prostitution , " @entity57 said that his priorities lie elsewhere			2
" right now , we want to get to the bottom of how these four individuals passed away , and who had a hand in their demise , " he said .			0
