last year , @entity0 received a surreal , breathy birthday serenade			1
@entity3 belted out " @entity4 " -- not far from @entity6 's rendition -- as the @entity8 crowd clapped in unison during a basketball game			2
this year 's birthday affairs are less likely to be bizarre -- @entity3 is not in town			1
@entity0 's birthday is believed to fall on january 8 , but like most affairs of @entity16 , his personal details are opaque			1
@entity16 state media has not acknowledged the exact date of @entity0 's birth in either of its @entity16 and @entity21 - language archives			1
" there is a lot of debate about the year he was born , " said @entity22 , a senior research fellow at the @entity23 , a @entity16 think tank			2
" some say it is 1984 while others say is ' 83 or ' 82			0
" in previous years , @entity0 has distributed sweets to children on january 7 which was a tradition held by his grandfather and father during their birthdays			1
the birthday of @entity39 , the founder of the country , is considered the @entity41 and falls on april 15			0
@entity43 's birthday , on february 16 , is known as the @entity44			2
these are the days when residents received goods from the state and children got sweets			0
the days are marked with pomp and circumstance , including military parades , patriotic chants and oaths of loyalty to the leaders			0
but the current leader @entity0 's birthday has been decidedly more low - key during his three years in power			1
" there 's a lot of speculation why that 's the case , " said @entity61 , professor of international relations at @entity63 in @entity64			0
" @entity0 could be trying to put out this image as a humble guy , that he 's not extravagant			0
then there 's sort of negative take on this issue , as to he 's still very young , 29 , 30 or 31			0
when you start marking his birthday , then the whole @entity16 people will start to wonder , then what 's his age ? " and revealing his age raises questions about experience			2
" it could be because he is a young leader			0
being young could have its advantage and disadvantage , but it appears as though he does n't want to make it public yet , " said @entity22			0
unlike his predecessors , there 's little sign that @entity0 's birthday is a major national holiday			1
the @entity91 reported last year that the current @entity16 leader 's birthday is not likely to be celebrated as a national holiday this year , after it reviewed five @entity16 calendars for 2015			1
and @entity16 workers at the joint @entity97 never have asked for a holiday on january 8 in the past two years , according to the @entity99 , the agency which handles @entity16 affairs			1
his birth date was first revealed by @entity103 , the former sushi chef of @entity0 's father , @entity43			1
" the date is known as accurate , but @entity16 never officially confirmed it , " said @entity22			0
the @entity99 recorded @entity0 's birthday as january 8 , although the exact year of birth is marked as 1982 , 1983 or 1984			1
in @entity0 's three years in power , he 's largely followed the legacies of his father and grandfather , said @entity61			1
a @entity64 report that released this week indicated that @entity16 could be closer to miniaturizing a nuclear warhead indicating that @entity0 has continued with the focus on nuclear weapons			2
and his regime has also been marked by the purge of @entity0 's uncle , @entity117 , who was executed after being branded a traitor in december 2013			2
" unfortunately , there were some hopes because he was educated in @entity122 and that he 's young , people hoped that there might be some change			0
none of that has happened			0
it might be worse , because he 's less experienced than his father and grandfather , and very rash and impatient as we 've seen with the cyberattacks , " @entity61 said , referring to a @entity130 hacking scandal in which the @entity131 blamed @entity16			2
@entity134 reported from @entity135 , @entity64 , and @entity136 reported and wrote from @entity137 .			0

@entity0 's birthday is believed to be january 8
unlike his father and grandfather , his birthday is more low - key than previous @entity16 leaders
@entity3 traveled to @entity16 last year and gave birthday serenade
