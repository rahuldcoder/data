-- @entity2 president @entity1 made his case thursday to the @entity5 people and the world for " a constructive approach " to contentious issues including his nation 's nuclear program , arguing that failing to engage " leads to everyone 's loss			1
" " we must work together to end the unhealthy rivalries and interferences that fuel violence and drive us apart , " @entity1 said in an op - ed published thursday evening on the @entity14 's website			1
it 's not the first time a leader from a country often at odds with the @entity5 has used its newspapers to convey his or her views			2
just last week , for instance , @entity29 president @entity28 argued against international military intervention in @entity32 and jabbed his @entity5 counterpart for saying @entity5 should consider themselves " exceptional " -- a remark that quickly elicited derision from across the @entity5 political spectrum			2
but @entity1 's tone differed from @entity28 's , echoing the theme of " prudence and hope " and the promise of more positive engagement with the rest of the world that helped propel him to an election win in june			0
" to move beyond impasses , ... we need to aim higher , " he said			0
" rather than focusing on how to prevent things from getting worse , we need to think -- and talk -- about how to make things better			0
" contending " the age of blood feuds " and the idea of diplomacy as a " zero - sum game " no longer apply in a " changed " world , @entity1 said leaders should engage each other " on the basis of equal footing and mutual respect			0
" " my approach to foreign policy seeks to resolve ... issues by addressing their underlying causes , " he said			0
" we must work together to end the unhealthy rivalries and interferences that fuel violence and drive us apart			0
" chief among those issues , for @entity2 , is its nuclear program			1
@entity2 officials have insisted its aim is peaceful and for energy purposes only , but skeptical @entity5 , @entity81 and other officials accuse @entity82 of working to develop nuclear weapons			1
@entity2 's lack of openness on the issue and its perceived lack of cooperation with international nuclear authorities , have led to stringent international sanctions and increased tensions in the region			1
in his opinion column thursday , @entity1 sought to frame the debate over what he called " our peaceful nuclear energy program			2
" this program , he said , is tied into not only addressing @entity2 's energy needs but also into establishing its place in the world			1
" to us , mastering the atomic fuel cycle and generating nuclear power is as much about diversifying our energy resources as it is about who @entity2 are as a nation , our demand for dignity and respect , and our consequent place in the world , " he said			2
the @entity14 column appears to be part of a @entity5 - targeted public relations initiative by @entity1 , coming a day after he talked with @entity117			1
in that interview , @entity1 said , " we have never pursued or sought a nuclear bomb and we are not going to do so			0
" @entity2 's @entity1 : diplomat 's touch , no pushover there 's little dispute @entity126 ayatollah @entity125 is @entity2 's most powerful figure			1
still , @entity1 said thursday that he and his delegation will head to @entity129 with the " full power and has complete authority " to make a deal with others on nuclear matters			0
the @entity2 president also talked about trading letters with @entity137 this summer , an exchange he called " positive and constructive			1
" " it could be subtle and tiny steps for a very important future , " @entity1 told @entity117 , according to video on the network 's website			0
" i believe the leaders in all countries could think in their national interests and that they should not be under the influence of ( interest ) groups			0
" @entity1 's @entity14 op - ed published a few hours after @entity5 secretary of state @entity152 -- also speaking in @entity153 -- characterized some of the new @entity2 president 's remarks as " very positive			1
" yet he offered his compliment with a caveat : " everything needs to be put to the test , and we 'll see where we go			0
" @entity2 human rights activist freed @entity152 punted on a question of whether @entity1 and @entity5 president @entity137 will meet next week when both attend the @entity165 in @entity129			1
asked the same question wednesday , @entity167 spokesman @entity166 said " there are currently no plans " for such a face - to - face meeting though he also did n't rule it out			0
and @entity166 did hint the @entity5 is open to talks with @entity2 -- with whom it has feuded regarding @entity2 's nuclear program , a dispute that 's led to harsh international sanctions and raised the specter of war in the region -- to " test " whether @entity82 is sincere in its hope to improve its international standing			1
" i think it 's fair to say that ( @entity137 ) believes there is an opportunity for diplomacy when it comes to the issues that have presented challenges to the @entity5 and our allies with regards to @entity2 , " @entity166 said			2
" and we hope that the @entity2 government takes advantage of this opportunity			0
" in fact , there were high - level talks thursday -- involving @entity2 foreign minister @entity199 and @entity165 @entity200 ban ki - moon			2
@entity199 called the meeting " constructive , " saying it involved " satisfactory negotiations " on various issues such as @entity2 's nuclear program , according to the state - run @entity206			1
@entity200 's office also issued a positive statement on the meeting , saying the two " discussed @entity2 's growing cooperation with the international community on a host of issues , including the nuclear file , as well the role @entity2 could play in promoting a political solution to the conflict in @entity32			1
" this cooperation has been spearheaded by @entity1 , himself a former nuclear negotiator who vowed during his campaign to try to reduce tensions between @entity2 and the outside world			2
that includes expressing openness in talks on its nuclear program			2
the 64 - year - old cleric , who is considered a moderate , said last month that as long as there are " negotiations without threats , the way for interaction is open			0
" report : @entity2 takes key step in nuclear reactor construction			0

new : in @entity14 op - ed , @entity2 's president says failing to engage " leads to everyone 's loss "
new : @entity2 's nuclear program is solely for energy , a matter of national pride , he says
@entity152 *praises* @entity2 president 's comments on talks , nuclear program
yet the top @entity5 diplomat adds : " everything needs to be put to the test "
