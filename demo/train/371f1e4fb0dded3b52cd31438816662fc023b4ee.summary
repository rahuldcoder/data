@entity0 -- all @entity4 airplanes must be checked for cracks in the wings , the @entity2 ordered wednesday			1
the order covering all @entity8 does not mean the planes must be grounded , said @entity10 , a spokesman for the aviation agency			1
" they can fly , they just have to be checked within the time frame , " he said			2
it expands an existing order that the 20 oldest @entity17 be checked for cracks , @entity10 said , adding , " now , with the second directive , we are including the whole fleet			1
" planes that have completed more than 1,384 takeoffs and landings must be inspected within three weeks of february 13 , the agency said			2
those that have completed 1,216 to 1,383 flight cycles have six weeks , and planes that have performed fewer than 1,216 cycles must be examined before they reach 1,300 cycles			0
if cracks are found , the airline must contact @entity4 for instructions , the agency said			1
