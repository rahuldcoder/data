they come from all over the world wearing her apparel or even dressed as her lookalike			0
it is , after all , the first convention for an icon whose image of irrepressible cuteness can send its worshippers swooning			0
@entity11 is celebrating its 40th year in grand fashion in one of downtown @entity15 ' classiest museums , and there are so many exhibits and so much merchandise for sale in the @entity20 that @entity11 fans are finding it hard to say goodbye			1
even songstress @entity23 made an appearance to receive a @entity11 tattoo on her finger			1
as celebratory as it is , the owners of @entity11 forbid any use of @entity31 salutations			1
instead , they insist on calling the first " @entity32 " an anniversary party			1
though the icon 's official " birthday " is november 1 , the faithful never use an age for her , explains @entity40 professor @entity39 , who 's written a book about @entity11			1
" we are celebrating @entity11 's 40th anniversary , and it 's just a global gathering of @entity11 fans from around the world to celebrate their love for @entity11 , " said @entity42 , senior director of marketing for the @entity45 firm @entity44 , owner of the character and its global merchandising			1
" @entity11 means so much to so many people in many different ways , " he added			1
" but i think it 's easily explained she 's just an ambassador of happiness , and she connects with people emotionally so she 's all about happiness and friendship and fun			0
" hello billion of dollars in sales @entity11 is also big business : she did more than $ 8 billion in retail business in 2013 , @entity42 said			1
that 's a lot of t - shirts , purses , notes , stickers , backpacks , school supplies , pencils and so on -- all bearing the icon 's image			0
and more is being added to the lucrative kitty with $ 30 tickets for adults and $ 20 tickets for children 6 to 12 for the festival			0
" @entity11 is a citizen of the world , we like to say , " said @entity82 , president of @entity44 " i think her message of representing friendship , kindness , is really contagious and it 's growing			1
" not surprisingly , enthusiasts are stampeding to the conference site , which includes the participation of the @entity93 in the nearby @entity95 neighborhood , where an exhibit shows the brand 's influence on art and culture			2
" this has been overwhelming , " @entity101 said			0
" over the course of the four days , we have sold over 25,000 tickets			1
we wished we could of actually had more people come , but the fire marshal gave us the no , no ! , and it 's just 100,000 square feet of just eye candy			1
" @entity109 , who 's been collecting @entity11 items since childhood , said she felt like she was in a fantasy land			1
" it 's just amazing to walk around here and see only @entity11 , " @entity113 said			1
the kitty appeals to men , too			0
@entity118 , who traveled more than 100 miles from @entity119 , became a @entity11 fan about two years ago when one of his friends introduced him to the character			1
" @entity11 makes everyone happy			2
she makes me happy , so it was a natural thing , " @entity118 said			0
another gentleman , @entity127 , got a free tattoo bearing the character 's image on his bicep			2
she really does n't have no gender			0
as you can see from the @entity32 , millions of people love her , " @entity134 said			2
he also bought merchandise with an unusual pairing : @entity11 with a snake			2
" what i got was a @entity11 wrapped around with a snake , " @entity134 said			2
" the reason i like the snake is because i 'm a snake in the @entity147 culture ( calendar ) , so i think it was a good fit with @entity11			2
" hello from another continent @entity151 , 40 , flew almost 8,000 miles from @entity152 , @entity153 , to attend the conference because she 's been dreaming about this event			1
" she 's my friend , my companion			1
she 's with me at home , at the office and people who know me know that i 'm her fan , " @entity156 said			2
the event comes two months after the @entity11 world was rocked with the revelation that the icon is n't a cat at all			2
the image is really a cartoon character of a little girl with strong feline features , according to @entity39 , who is visiting professor of @entity45 studies at @entity40 and an anthropologist at the @entity172			0
the anthropologist 's declaration was , let 's say , " cataclysmic " for the international icon			0
@entity39 , who 's among the guest speakers at the conference , tried to explain the soul of the character			0
she wrote a book last year entitled " @entity182 : @entity11 's @entity183			1
" " @entity11 obviously takes the form of a cat but in spirit , she more inhabits the presence -- and the internal of the heart - felt presence -- of a girl			0
and now a kind of global icon celebrity , " @entity39 said			0
" @entity11 is supposed to be a perpetual third - grader			0
she 's very friendly , she likes to travel , she likes her mother 's apple pie , so she 's kind of like a homebody but has an adventurous spirit , " @entity39 said			0
perhaps , it 's a good thing that @entity11 represents a little girl and not a little cat			1
if it were a feline , its 40 years would equate to 177 human years old			0
hardly a kitty any more .			0

@entity11 owner @entity44 sells 25,000 tickets to first ' @entity32 '
a fan travels from @entity153 to @entity15 because " she 's my friend , my companion "
even singer @entity23 shows up to get a @entity11 tattoo on her finger
@entity44 wants to sell more tickets but " the fire marshal gave us the no , no ! "
