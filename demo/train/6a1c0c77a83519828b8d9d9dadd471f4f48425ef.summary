@entity115 's retrial is expected to begin in september , after which he will be sentenced for his previous convictions			2
@entity131 the defense lawyer was inundated with calls after his victory defending the man who was once described as " the most hated man in @entity12			0
" @entity131 , who does not currently represent @entity3 , is now flush with new business and is a current @entity0 legal contributor			1
of the approximately $ 2.5 million legal fees racked up over the course of the trial , @entity131 and co-counsel @entity143 each received a single payment of approximately 2.4 % of the total costs -- or about $ 30,000 each			0
there is no expectation of further payments			0
@entity149 the ousted former @entity150 , @entity2 , police chief , who took the brunt of criticism about how the initial investigation in the shooting was conducted , is now working as a special agent with the @entity157 's @entity156			2

five white women and one black @entity193 woman were on the main panel ; four alternate jurors , two men and two women , were also selected			0
juror @entity197 told @entity199 she believed @entity3 " got away with murder " but that she had to " grab our hearts and put it aside and look at the evidence			2
" alternate juror @entity204 told @entity206 he " supported the verdict			0
