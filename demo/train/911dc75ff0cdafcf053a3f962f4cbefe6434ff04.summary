@entity0 , @entity1 -- a former @entity6 lacrosse player accused of fatally beating his ex-girlfriend contributed to her death , but did not kill her and had no intent to do so , his attorney argued saturday			1
the defense and prosecution have rested in the murder trial of @entity13 , which is expected to resume on wednesday			1
" yes , @entity13 contributed to her death			1
but no , he did n't kill her			0
he left there with her alive , and that is not in dispute			0
there was no intentional killing , because she was n't dead when he left , " defense attorney @entity20 said during his closing statement			0
" there 's no intent to rob , and no intent to kill			0
" @entity13 faces six charges , including robbery and first - degree murder in the may 2010 death of @entity33 , a 22 - year - old senior who was also a lacrosse player			1
on saturday , the defendant officially waived his right to testify			0
@entity20 described his client as " stupid , drunk -- but not calculating			1
" the defense has said @entity40 's death was an accident			1
police were initially called to @entity40 's off - campus @entity0 apartment by a roommate who reported " a possible alcohol overdose , " police chief @entity42 said at the time			2
a medical examiner later ruled that blunt force trauma killed @entity40 , and authorities allege that @entity13 caused it during an altercation			2
" when somebody 's little girl does n't wake up the next day , and there 's no reason why they should n't ... i ask you to do no more , and no less , than to hold him responsible for what he did , " said @entity57 's attorney @entity56			1
at several points during his closing statement , @entity40 's mother and sister cried			0
twice , it appeared @entity56 was also crying , or chocking back tears			0
" it goes without saying that this woman is never going to be able to say what happened to her ... but the evidence proves she was killed in the commission of a robbery , " he told the jury			0
after closing arguments , the judge had hoped to give the case to jurors , but they felt they were too tired to continue			0
the trial will resume wednesday morning and deliberations are expected to begin shortly thereafter			1
prosecutors have claimed all along that @entity13 followed through on his intentions to kill @entity40			2
earlier in the trial , @entity56 read e-mails exchanged between the two after @entity13 heard @entity40 had allegedly slept with someone else			1
the defendant wrote , " i should have killed you , " and @entity40 responded , " you should have killed me ? " according to @entity56			0
@entity13 responded that the pair should talk , @entity56 said			2
the prosecutor also told jurors that @entity40 's death was slow and painful , claiming she could have remained alive for a couple of hours after @entity13 left her apartment			1
the defense agrees @entity40 was alive when @entity13 left			2
@entity0 police detective @entity94 wrote in a sworn statement used to obtain a search warrant in the case that " @entity13 admitted on may 3 , 2010 , that he was involved in an altercation with @entity33 and , during the course of the altercation , he shook @entity40 and her head repeatedly hit the wall			1
" the defense attorney has said there is no evidence that @entity40 's head hit a wall , and on saturday , the defense called a witness who questioned the nature of @entity40 's injuries			1
@entity112 , a neurosurgeon , testified it was " possible , but less likely " that the victim 's brain injuries were the result of blunt force trauma			2
@entity13 has been held for nearly two years			0
if he 's convicted of involuntary manslaughter , the most time he could serve is 10 years .			0
