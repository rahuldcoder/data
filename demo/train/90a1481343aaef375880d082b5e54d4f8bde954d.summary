-- the deadly attack on the @entity3 @entity2 in @entity4 underscores the gaping power vacuum across @entity6 since the toppling of @entity9 's regime last year			1
fighting groups that battled @entity9 have stepped in to maintain law and order after the fall of the regime , an expert on @entity6 told @entity0			1
most of the groups are simply neighborhood watch entities			1
but some include hard - line @entity20 and have " a very @entity23 orientation , " said @entity24 , a senior associate in the @entity25 at the @entity26			2
the group accused of being behind the consulate assault , the @entity27 , is said to be pro-al @entity30			2
@entity31 , online gaming maven among @entity4 dead " the problem is that the @entity35 army and the @entity6 police forces effectively disintegrated , " @entity24 said			1
" these groups are basically running the show " throughout much of @entity6			1
another analyst , @entity39 , a @entity40 - based researcher focused on security issues in @entity42 and the @entity43 , said the militias , criminal groups , and hard - line @entity23 groups in @entity6 make up a " somewhat diffuse " environment			1
" some groups , such as the @entity50 in @entity4 and @entity51 and the imprisoned @entity52 have been involved in increasing shows of force and outright attacks against @entity57 and other targets in @entity6 in recent months , " he said			1
@entity24 , in speaking to @entity0 , cited two of his recent essays about security in @entity6			1
one was in foreign affairs in july and the other appeared wednesday on the @entity26 website			2
he said the fledgling government is in a bind			1
officials are trying to demobilize and reintegrate the militias and bring these groups into the government security forces , he said			1
but the militia members across @entity6 remain loyal to their groups and distrust the new government 's authority , in part because of the " taint " of a link to the @entity9 regime , @entity24 said			1
the government has used militia commanders to quell tribal fighting , subcontracted border control and defense of oil installations to small brigades , and used armed groups to provide security during elections			1
in @entity4 , he said , ballots for an election were stored and counted at the headquarters of the city 's strongest militia			1
six things to know about the attack " the strategy of trying to dismantle the regional militias while simultaneously making use of them as hired guns might be sowing the seeds for the country 's descent into warlordism , " he warned			1
" it has also given local brigades and their political patrons leverage over the central government			2
emboldened by the writ of state authority , brigade commanders have been free to carry out vendettas against rival towns and tribes , particularly those favored by ... @entity9 , " @entity24 said			2
violence between warring militias and attacks against @entity57 and moderate @entity123 targets erupted in recent months , @entity24 said			1
in @entity4 , there was a " rapid deterioration " of security before the @entity3 @entity2 attack			0
pro-al @entity30 group seen behind deadly @entity4 attack a strike on a @entity132 consulate vehicle in @entity4 in june wounded a diplomat			0
the @entity134 said its workers endured attacks at least five times in less than three month in @entity4 and @entity138			0
the group announced the suspension of its activities in august			0
the @entity27 , in fact , first surfaced in may when it claimed responsibility for an attack on the @entity134 office in @entity4			0
the next month it claimed responsibility for detonating a blast outside the @entity3 @entity2 in @entity4			0
it also released a video of the attack			0
@entity123 mosques and tombs were among the sites targeted			2
@entity123 is considered a more moderate form of @entity154			0
@entity35 interior minister @entity155 was quoted by @entity156 as calling the attackers " groups that have a strict @entity154 ideology where they believe that graves and shrines must be desecrated			1
" that comment , @entity156 said , refers to @entity164 , the name for those @entity166 who want a " return to @entity154 as they believe it was practiced in the days of the @entity169			0
" salafists have increasingly asserted themselves in eastern @entity6			1
in june , hundreds of fighters wielding @entity172 and black @entity23 banners converged on @entity4 to call for the imposition of sharia law			2
this spring , an associate of @entity30 leader @entity177 addressed a large gathering in the town square of @entity51 , in eastern @entity6			1
an online video of his address has been seen by @entity0			0
" @entity164 militias have reportedly carried out assassinations of @entity9 - era officials , taken over radio stations and shut down beauty parlors , " @entity24 said			0
@entity51 has for years been a recruiting ground for @entity30			0
a 2008 diplomatic cable from @entity190 , the @entity3 ambassador to @entity6 who was slain in the consulate attack , described the area as " a wellspring of @entity35 foreign fighters " for @entity30 in @entity195			1
in some cases , @entity24 said , the revolutionary brigades have become " very sophisticated			0
" they have checkpoints , security headquarters , id cards , and their own payroll			0
some militia coalitions have made handshake deals to police areas			2
@entity208 police , demonstrators hurt in @entity3 embassy " these are militias that operate openly , " and operate blogs and @entity213 pages			0
with that @entity164 foothold in eastern @entity6 , @entity24 said , it would n't be hard for armed militia members to " converge on a target " in @entity4 with an hour 's notice			1
was @entity30 involved ? @entity219 , the @entity30 branch that operates in @entity42 , would have connections in the country 's far south , if it indeed has any network in @entity6 , @entity24 said			1
and @entity39 said he 's seen no evidence of " overt " @entity219 involvement in @entity35 violence , despite reports of arrests , smuggling and weapons purchases linked to the group			0
as for other militia groups , he said , " there is little public evidence linking their actions to @entity30 , even if some of these groups ' leaders have extensive militant pasts and ties with the group			1
" " however , " he added , " we know very little about the exact compositions of @entity6 's hard - line militias beyond the top public leadership , making it impossible to say definitively whether or not links or relationships with other jihadist organizations like @entity30 , or members of these organizations , are playing a role in militia - led violence in @entity6			1
" regarding the consulate attack , @entity24 said he thinks the strike " was a much more local affair " than one that involved @entity219			0
he called it " the latest in a series of attacks by the country 's increasingly active @entity20			0
" " @entity35 ' public reaction to such strong - arm tactics has been vociferous and damning , " @entity24 said			0
" tribes , women 's groups , and civil society -- as well as the country 's increasingly active social media community -- have all mobilized to condemn the recent attacks on @entity123 , while mounting demonstrations of their own against the @entity20 ' shows of force			2
" @entity24 said that " much of the violence suggests a movement in search of a cause			0
" @entity20 " are now grasping at foreign causes they believe will excite @entity35 ' emotions , " such as the @entity287 - @entity286 conflict , @entity288 , and anti-americanism , he said			0
meanwhile , the country 's provisional government has had to deputize revolutionary brigades for security work			2
" invariably , these poorly trained bodies contain a number of @entity164 militias who have used their warrant from the government to enforce draconian social mores , conduct vendettas against @entity9 - era intelligence officers , and attack @entity123 , " @entity24 said			2
citizens have voiced outrage over @entity164 shows of force and have mobilized against their " strong - arm tactics against , for example , the @entity123			0
" " for the citizens of @entity311 , @entity4 and other cities , all this is a stark and tragic reminder of the perennial problems of poor governance and the security vacuum , " @entity24 said			0
