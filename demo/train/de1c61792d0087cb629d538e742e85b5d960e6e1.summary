the air travel debate of the moment -- about seat width on planes -- is an easy one to be seduced by			2
@entity4 released a marketing campaign last month claiming 18 - inch - wide seats -- compared to 17 inches -- make sleep much easier and have called on airlines to make these standard in economy - class , long - haul flights			1
@entity12 , so far , have not been enthused with most refusing to be drawn into the debate and others , such as @entity15 , as diplomatically as possible suggesting it 's a non-starter			0
it certainly seems like an odd campaign for a supplier to embark on , apparently trying to dictate to customers what they should be buying			0
but it 's also a rather clever campaign i would argue , a gamble that @entity4 does n't need to pay off			1
there 's a telling quote from the @entity4 head of passenger comfort , @entity27 , who says : " economy passengers who are not prepared to accept long - haul 17 - inch crusher seats ... will choose airlines that offer better seat comfort			1
we are encouraging them to be aware of the difference an inch makes in long - haul economy			1
" so on the face of it this campaign is aimed at passengers , who will then supposedly pressure airlines to offer 18 - inch - wide seats			1
the kicker is this -- fliers in economy are unlikely to start demanding anything			1
the economy expectation economy fliers get the worst seats , the blandest food , the noisiest cabins and guess what -- we expect that , because we also get the cheapest tickets			2
let 's just get there , and get out , is the mentality			0
it 's not like we 're business or first class fliers who airlines do occasionally listen to			2
proof comes in the form of @entity4 ' own cabin layout page for the @entity67 , which promotes economy seating of much less than 18 inches to its clients , even while telling the world 18 inches should be standard			1
so @entity4 puts out the right message to the public , we feel a little better that at least someone appears to be complaining on our behalf while behind the scenes the industry carries on as usual			1
well fellow coach - class fliers , it 's time to start speaking up			1
i recently flew @entity80 to @entity81 , @entity82 -- a tortuous 14 hours in an economy - class middle seat , with a coughing , wheezing , hacking old man on one side and a fidgeting @entity89 / @entity88 / @entity87 on the other			1
after a claustrophobic , knee - bumping , armrest battleground of a flight like that , you 'd think more space would be welcome , right ? there 's an alternate view			2
better headrests required it struck me that the problem here would n't be solved by an extra inch of space , nor perhaps even by an extra three inches of space			1
but maybe it could by headrest design			0
as i drifted off into a semi-slumber , my noggin had nowhere to go			0
i was rudely awoken on several occasions by my own skull as it went into a slow - motion collision course with one of my neighbors			0
the little flick - out flaps -- or " wings " -- that are now common on airline seat headrests make it about 0.5 % more likely that your head will stay put allowing you to get some good zzzs			1
so you can keep the extra inch of width -- what i want is a seat that keeps my head in place while i doze			2
unfortunately , and as expected , no one was particularly convinced			0
the airlines i contacted gave the usual sound bites about how great their economy class seats were already , while @entity4 just took the opportunity to underline their existing seat campaign			1
" headrests in our opinion are not as critical as seat width , " says @entity135 , manager media relations at @entity4			1
" some passengers find headrests helpful and some find them uncomfortable			2
but an extra inch in seat width definitely provides more comfort for all			2
" a good point , particularly considering that as a six - foot , 80 - kilo man , i am probably mr average when it comes to size			0
fliers bigger than me would likely prefer bigger seats			0
but would they not also enjoy better headrests ? who 's responsible ? @entity157 refused to be drawn on an area they do n't see as their turf			0
" seat design is handled and decided by the airlines , not the airframe manufacturers			1
we simply ensure the seats comply to safety standards , " says a spokesman			0
i suppose as a cheap - fare hunting , bland - food eating economy - class flier , i should n't expect to be taken too seriously			0
but then i contacted one of the seat - manufacturing companies			2
" the headrest is one of the features that can improve the comfort experience during a flight , " says dr. @entity174 , ceo of @entity175 , promisingly			0
he goes on to describe a headrest that can be tilted horizontally " for optimal neck support while sleeping , " with adjustable side bolsters for a better resting position , an " exceptionally " wide height adjustment range and increased wings			0
i do n't know whether this is the headrest revolution i 'm requesting , but i 'm glad someone else considers the thing worth at least some effort			0
would you prefer wider seats on planes , or are there other areas of cabin comfort you think would improve travel ? tell us below .			0

@entity4 released report claiming 18 - inch seats better for sleeping than 17 - inch seats
but will passengers start demanding this of airlines ?
headrests also a key focus of design for plane seat manufacturers
