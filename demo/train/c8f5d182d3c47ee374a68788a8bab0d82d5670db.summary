-- what @entity1 asserts is @entity4 's launch of two air strikes on @entity6 last week presents a marked and dangerous escalation of that country 's involvement in the @entity1 war			1
@entity4 's intervention -- if confirmed -- also shows how the conflict has mutated from a political uprising to an internal armed struggle , and now to a regional war by proxy fiercely fought on @entity1 's killing fields			1
( @entity4 has a policy of refusing to confirm or deny attacks attributed to its military			0
) the confrontation in @entity1 has become more complex , more perilous , and more difficult to resolve			0
the @entity1 struggle has not only spread into @entity1 's neighbors , like @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 -- but has also become a battlefield wherein @entity4 and @entity30 are challenging each other			1
there is also a fierce geostrategic rivalry unfolding in @entity1 between @entity35 - dominant @entity34 and @entity30 , a rivalry invested and fuelled with sectarianism			2
a real danger exists that this complex conflict in @entity1 could escalate into a region - wide battle involving @entity1 's major allies -- @entity30 and @entity44 , and @entity4 , other regional powers , and the @entity46 states			1
@entity4 's alleged deepening involvement in the conflict also changes the dynamics of the political struggle in @entity1 in two ways			1
it puts the armed opposition on the defensive , because it shows them that they and @entity4 are indirectly battling the same enemy -- the @entity59 regime			0
and it reinforces president @entity59 's dominant narrative : that the struggle in @entity1 is not internal , that this is not about a domestic coalition striving to replace authoritarianism with democracy -- but rather this is a wider conspiracy spearheaded by @entity4 and its regional allies and @entity46 powers			2
the @entity1 official media has already portrayed @entity4 's bombings as an attempt to shore up the armed opposition and reverse the balance of power in its favor			1
although the @entity76 leadership has repeatedly stated that it would come to the aid of @entity1 if it is attacked by @entity4 , it is unlikely that @entity30 or its partner @entity44 would retaliate directly against @entity4 's possible strikes			1
both @entity30 and @entity44 would like to avoid a regional conflict in which @entity4 and its allies would have the upper hand			2
opinion : is @entity84 failing on moral leadership ? what @entity30 and @entity44 would most likely do is deepen their involvement in @entity1 's shifting sands			2
in an emotional speech last week , @entity90 , the @entity44 top leader , stressed that @entity59 's allies will not allow @entity1 to fall			0
now @entity44 and @entity30 would become more determined than ever to prevent the removal of @entity59 from power			0
bluntly put , the recent escalation of hostilities will not only prolong the deadly conflict in @entity1 , but has now made it an open - ended war by proxy -- one with major potential repercussions for regional and international security and peace			2
@entity4 's major goal appears to be the establishment of a red line in @entity1 , whereby no advanced weapons reach @entity44 -- its archenemy in @entity25			1
@entity4 's primary audience was @entity44 and @entity30			2
@entity4 is taking a calculated gamble that neither @entity1 nor @entity44 would risk retaliation			0
@entity84 : ' do not foresee scenario ' of @entity114 boots on ground in @entity1 there is a risk of miscalculation that could trigger a bigger clash			0
given the risks and the dangers of a region - wide conflict , one would hope that the great powers -- particularly the @entity114 and @entity125 -- would assume their historic responsibility and reach an understanding that begins the process of putting an end to the deadly struggle in @entity1 that has killed more than 70,000 @entity1 , according to the latest @entity132 estimate , and caused a humanitarian disaster			1
more than two years after the breakout of the @entity1 confrontation there does not seem to be a military solution			0
it is a long war of attrition with no end in sight			0
neither internal camp seems to have the means to deliver a decisive blow			0
only a political solution will put an end to the shedding of @entity1 blood and prevent the unthinkable : a region - wide conflict that would have catastrophic consequences			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity154 .			0

@entity154 : @entity4 's alleged involvement changes the dynamics of @entity1 struggle
@entity30 stated it would aid @entity1 if it is attacked by @entity4 , but it is unlikely it would retaliate directly
a political solution will put an end to the *bloodshed* and prevent a region - wide conflict , he says
