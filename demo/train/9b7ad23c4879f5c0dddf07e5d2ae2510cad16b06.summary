-- in peeking ahead to predict what 2012 holds for @entity3 , it 's informative to look back at the eventful year it had			1
while one ca n't help but see the big product introductions -- a social network , a mobile - payment system , a music store -- it 's the deletions that are much more interesting			0
@entity3 got rid of a host of unwieldy and barely used products and features in 2011			1
while @entity3 regularly does " spring cleaning " to trim its vast portfolio , the projects scrapped this year were many , and most were originally intended to be major focuses of the company			1
just look at this partial list of the services killed or folded into larger projects : buzz			0
even the company 's well - meaning initiative to save the world from coal - fired power plants got tossed			0
the mass culling is indicative of the style of @entity3 's new ceo , @entity30			1
of course , @entity30 was @entity3 's first ceo , too , stepping aside for a decade to let @entity32 run the show while page and fellow company co-founder @entity34 could craft the company 's web services			1
@entity3 experimented a lot during that decade , and now that page is back in the driver 's seat , he appears to have gotten that out of his system			2
page is leading @entity3 with unprecedented focus			1
from the major moves the company has made in the nine short months since @entity30 got the top job , it 's clearer than ever which technologies @entity3 is really serious about			1
after all , the ones it 's more lukewarm toward have probably gotten the ax			0
being serious is n't the same as success , of course , but it 's an essential first step			0
@entity3 may be aggressively plowing ahead in the areas of social networking , mobile payments and mobile devices , but so are many other heavy hitters			2
there are sure to be some collisions in 2012			0
let 's take a look at some key ones			0
@entity66 comes into its own probably the most head - turning @entity3 product launch in 2011 was the debut of @entity66			1
@entity3 's very own social network borrows elements from @entity73 and @entity74 , but is its own animal			2
the launch saw virtually instant adoption by pretty much anyone and everyone who considered themselves tech - or media - savvy			0
and that 's been its greatest weakness			0
@entity66 has had favorable growth and many positive reviews , but it 's still relatively unknown among " real " people			2
and those that do know it have the distinct impression that it 's the social network for hard - core nerds			0
that 's something @entity3 has to change if it wants people to use its service instead of competitors , and going mainstream has to be a primary goal in the new year			1
it can do so by leveraging its differentiators ( like the useful multiple - person videoconferencing hangouts ) , but most of all it has to find its voice -- its one - sentence description that does n't have the words " like @entity74 " in it			0
this task is largely up to its users , since they 're the ones using the service , deciding which features they like and how they use it			0
they 're already starting to , with many @entity112 treating the site like a centralized , supercharged blogging service			0
even as @entity66 grows , though , it 's doubtful that it 'll ever be able to rise as high as @entity74 , which is expected to hit a cool billion users this year			1
but as long as the service starts to become known as " the place where you ... " something , maybe @entity117 , the digital - savvy womanizer on " @entity119 " will be regularly referencing it by the end of 2012			0
@entity126 puts its house in order the most sticking criticism of @entity126 is its fragmentation problem -- that there are so many devices running it , often with completely different specs , that it 's impossible to know with any certainty whether or not your device will ever get any updates that @entity3 releases			1
that may not have hurt the platform 's market share , but it 's no doubt given a good chunk of potential customers pause			0
@entity3 's acquisition of @entity148 is a big step toward , if not putting this fragmentation business to rest , at least turning the tide a little			1
you can bet the farm that every @entity148 device released under the new @entity3 regime will have a clear upgrade path			2
although @entity3 's other partners are wary of potential favoritism to @entity148 , this actually works in @entity3 's favor , too , since now they 'll be strongly motivated to get in line with @entity3 's plans , lest customers opt for the perceived reliability of the @entity167 / @entity3 name			2
at the same time , the recent @entity126 malware scares have given the platform a black eye			2
while @entity3 has been very effective at addressing viruses and trojans in various evildoing apps as they 've appeared , it needs to deploy a more proactive strategy to attack the issue head - on			2
could an acquisition of , say , mobile - security company lookout be next ? it could n't hurt			0
ceding tablet territory while building content it 's something of a embarrassment to @entity3 that the most popular @entity126 tablet ever launched is the @entity184 , which does n't even run @entity3 's tablet - optimized operating system			1
@entity192 , by creating highly customized software that runs on top of @entity126 and points users to the company 's digital services , essentially carved out its own platform by hijacking @entity3 's			1
since @entity126 is an open system , there 's not much @entity3 can do about it			1
at this point , it does n't really want to just yet			0
tablets so far are essentially media - consumption devices -- good for watching tv and movies , reading books and playing games			0
as colossal as the company is in many areas ( see below ) , right now @entity3 is far from a big player in offering actual content			1
@entity207 and @entity208 are anemic services , if not outright flops			0
@entity211 , though promising , is brand new and has no mind share			0
so it makes sense that consumers reacted to " proper " @entity126 tablets with disdain			2
after all , @entity3 never opened up version 3.0 " @entity222 , " so anyone with actual content to offer ( i.e. @entity192 and @entity220 ) had no interest in using it			1
the devices on offer were virtually identical overpriced touchscreens whose only noteworthy commonality was that they were n't @entity229			0
even though @entity3 's just gotten into the hardware business by purchasing @entity148 , i ca n't see it focusing much on tablets just yet			2
sure , the successors to the @entity234 are on their way , and they 'll even move into the hands of a few customers , but @entity3 must first focus on bumping up the quality and reputation of its content offerings before any " @entity241 " has a shot at gobbling up market share from @entity244 and @entity192			1
original videos on @entity246 is great first step -- there will be many more in 2012			0
@entity249 cements domination of the cloud this is kind of a no - brainer , but @entity3 will continue its blot - out - the - sun dominance in its primary services : search , email and cloud services in general			1
@entity259 , the only credible challenger to @entity3 's search business , is rising , but very slowly , and that 's with @entity262 shoveling mountains of money into the service			1
and even though @entity267 and @entity268 now offer much better services than they did a couple of years ago , @entity266 still has the ( deserved ) reputation of being the best and coolest of the lot			2
@entity3 's been the cloud business for a long time , of course , but when it finally unveils its expected @entity277 competitor , nicknamed @entity249 , it 's hard to see it not becoming an instant hit			1
@entity3 is already synonymous with storing stuff online , and with @entity66 it 's showed it can deftly merge disparate services to create a new and seamless experience			1
standing against @entity3 's huge storage capabilities and cloud expertise could be too much for any other player in the space			1
overall : going with what works @entity30 appears to have instilled @entity3 with a new sense of focus , quickly striking while the iron 's hot on promising products like @entity66 and @entity126 , putting stagnant ones like @entity292 out of their misery , and nurturing potential late - starters like @entity295			1
some games , after all , are long , and we wo n't know for a while whether the company 's bets on technologies such as mobile payments or solar panels will ever pay off			0
as soon as @entity30 sees a winner , though , he clearly knows how to put the overwhelming force of the entire @entity3 empire behind it			2
before 2012 is out , he 'll no doubt have done it several times			0
