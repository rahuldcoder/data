@entity0 -- the former secretary of state 's most ardent supporters and organizers will meet friday in @entity5 to discuss what now looks like an all - but - certain @entity8 campaign for president			1
ready for @entity8 , a @entity10 that has been organizing around a @entity12 run for almost two years , is hosting an all - day strategy session that will bring together the different groups that have been working around a @entity12 run since shortly after she left the @entity17 in early 2013			1
the @entity19 meeting -- which is being held at the @entity21 in @entity5 -- is part rally , part history lesson for the @entity12 supporters and will bring together top flight @entity26 strategists , longtime @entity12 supporters and at least three people rumored to be the former secretary of state 's next campaign manager			1
@entity32 , the executive director of the @entity33 ; @entity34 , the president of @entity36 ; and @entity37 , a political operative who worked for @entity12 in 2008 , have all been rumored as likely picks for @entity12 's top campaign job			1
all three will sit on panels and discuss @entity12 's future friday			2
ready for @entity8 has been the most high profile pro-clinton super pac that sprung up to boost @entity12 between her years at the @entity17 and her eventual presidential run			1
founded in 2013 , the group has been focused on garnering grassroots support , building a sizable list of supporters and raising money			0
the organization has worked somewhat like a ground and grassroots operations for @entity12 , dispatching volunteers to different events and sending a campaign bus to drive across the country and rally support			2
@entity59 has also started to grease the wheels of state and local politics			0
the group has sold or traded its email list with over 30 state parties and donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to state parties and local campaigns			0
but friday 's meeting -- and an eventual @entity12 announcement - are somewhat of a going away party for @entity59 and its young , excited staffers			1
multiple sources from the group told @entity1 that while @entity59 will keep working until @entity12 announces her candidacy , the group will wind down operations that day the former first lady announces			1
" that is the point at which we would wind down because we are not going to have a separate and competing field and grass roots infrastructure across the country , " said one source with knowledge of @entity59 's plans			0
" rather than continuing our efforts across the country , we would tell our supporters , ' @entity8 has a campaign , go join it			0
' " the day @entity12 announces , the group will also make their supporter list available to the @entity12 campaign , allowing their operation to reach out and activate the supporters ready for @entity8 have cultivated across the country			1
as @entity59 prepares to fade away , two other super pacs boosting @entity12 are starting to ramp up			2
priorities @entity95 , the super pac tasked with big money fundraising and ad buying , is in a place to step up the moment that @entity12 declares her run			2
although the group promised not to raise money for @entity12 while other groups competed for donations around the 2014 midterms , organizers from priorities have been meeting with big @entity26 donors across the country and plan to contact those donors the instant @entity12 announces			1
the group is currently " sitting down and talking with donors " but not " making direct asks until there is a candidate in place , " said a @entity95 organizer			0
" i think , once the sort of wheels are in motion , we will go back to the folks that we are meeting with and then there will be solid fundraising off that , " the source said			0
" once things really start to ramp up , that is when we get the checks in the door			0
" representatives from @entity95 , including strategist @entity131 , executive director @entity132 and the group 's financial adviser @entity135 , will speak at friday 's event			0
correct the @entity137 , a communications and research outfit that has been operating for over a year , is another @entity10 gearing up to run side - by - side with a @entity12 campaign			2
according to a source with knowledge of the group 's planning , @entity137 plans on ramping up in the coming months and tapping into the research they have invested in for months			0
while the group will have a presence at the @entity59 event -- founder @entity150 will moderate a panel -- over three dozen @entity153 the @entity137 donors will meet friday in @entity5 to discuss @entity12 and the future			1
@entity150 , according to the source , will tell attendees that he has decided his group will continue through the 2016 election and will use their rapid response and research to push the message of the eventual @entity12 campaign .			0
