-- when people want to give back to their community , they typically pull out their checkbooks			1
@entity5 decided to pull out his running shoes			1
the 28 - year - old it consultant pledged to run 26.2 miles a day for 26 days -- a total of 681.2 miles -- to raise money and awareness for the @entity11 of @entity12			1
" my hopes are that people will see and hear about this epic mission and open their eyes a little bit , " @entity5 said on day eight of his challenge			1
" @entity19 is n't all about the sparkling lights and big hotels and casinos			2
in the shadows and down the alleys that surround the @entity25 , people are hungry			2
" the mission @entity5 first came to @entity0 's attention through longtime @entity29 @entity28 , who was in @entity19 and read about his campaign			1
@entity5 spent @entity31 on the street			1
he woke up , went to church and ran all day			2
after completing his daily marathon , @entity5 came home for a @entity31 meal of salad and protein shakes			1
@entity39 : 26 marathons in 26 days he 's not complaining			2
he says he started this challenge to draw attention to impoverished people who go hungry on a daily basis			1
" you drive around any city in the @entity47 , and there 's always someone somewhere holding a sign or digging through a garbage can for something to eat , " he says			2
" it 's great that everyone donates a turkey at @entity31 , but this is something bigger than just @entity31			0
" an estimated 16.2 % of the @entity12 population is considered " food insecure , " meaning people do not know when or from where their next meal will come			2
that 's above the national average of 14.5 % for 2012 , according to @entity62			0
nationally , some 17.6 million households are considered " food insecure			0
" @entity65 , chief development officer at @entity11 , says @entity12 's continued poverty is due in large part to the " triple whammy " that occurred in 2008 : home foreclosures , bankruptcies and high unemployment			1
" the economic recovery -- if there 's any going on in the country -- has really not entrenched itself here , " @entity65 says			0
though @entity5 has never participated in an official race , he often runs marathon distances			1
the most he has ever run in one day is 52 miles			2
when @entity5 pitched his idea , @entity65 knew he could trust @entity78 to complete this challenge to raise money and awareness for the food bank			1
" the first observation i made about @entity84 was that he was very calm , " @entity65 says			0
" and with that calmness was a very big aura of confidence that he could physically accomplish this feat. " one step at a time each day , @entity5 woke up at 4:15 a.m. he went to the kitchen for an energizing shake , then took a hot shower and got ready to run another 26.2 miles			1
but it was n't always easy			0
because he was n't racing , it took black five to six hours to complete the distance each day			0
he usually ran outside but often had trouble finding an open road to run on			2
he also suffered from a shin injury and a stress fracture , but it did n't stop him			1
" i kind of look at my body as an engine , " he says			0
" unless doctors say you ca n't go any further , then we 're going to get to the finish line			0
" when he first told his friends that he would complete 26 marathons in 26 days , they had mixed reactions			0
" some of my friends said , ' you are nuts			0
how is your body going to handle it ? ' and then i told them why i was doing it , " he says			0
" they would start off dumbfounded , but they would always walk away inspired			0
" even though @entity5 was confident , he sometimes worried he might not be able to cross the finish line			1
if he got seriously injured , there was no other plan than to quit			0
but all doubts vanished when @entity5 ran along the @entity25			1
" we ran into a lot of homeless people downtown , and once you tell them what you 're doing , they get a little sparkle in their eye , " he says			1
" and they thank you			0
that 's probably one of the most gratifying parts of this whole thing -- knowing that i have an opportunity to tell these people that we have n't forgotten about them			2
" the finish line @entity5 set out with a mission to raise both financial donations and nonperishable food items for the food bank			1
@entity65 says he did n't want to peg @entity5 's efforts to a specific dollar amount			1
in fact , @entity65 has n't even kept track of the amount of money raised during the challenge			1
" if i am focused on just the dollar amount , then i 'm missing the purpose of exactly what he 's trying to accomplish here , " he says			0
@entity5 started with a goal of $ 4,000			1
he raised a total of $ 4,024			2
all of his proceeds will go to the @entity11			1
because of the food bank 's efficiencies , @entity65 says each dollar can be turned into three meals			0
to commemorate his achievement , the @entity162 in @entity12 declared december 23 , 2013 , @entity164			0
" for the first time in my life , i feel truly blessed			0
it 's not really a sense of relief , it 's a sense of accomplishment , " @entity5 said after finishing			2
" we do n't have any specific plans yet , but we 'll wrap up 2013 with a big bow and then we 'll get a team together and start thinking about next year			0
" though @entity5 's mission came to an end monday , he wants people to know they can make a positive contribution in their own communities no matter where they are located			1
" you do n't have to run 26 marathons in 26 days to make someone smile , " he says			0
" you do n't have to do crazy epic stuff			0
any one of us can make a difference			0
