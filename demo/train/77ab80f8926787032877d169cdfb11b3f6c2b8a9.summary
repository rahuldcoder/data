-- until death do us apart and beyond ... i sent him a text message from holiday saying : " having a great time in @entity8			1
i am riding an authentic @entity10 horse			1
" his reply came within seconds saying : " well , if that horse knew how to speak @entity14 he would have gone to the police and complained			1
" he was referring to my weight			1
it is exactly this kind of response that i miss most			1
i miss his promptitude and presence of mind			1
they say war brings the worst out of people but what about prison ? especially if it was a prison run and supervised by the @entity32 security apparatus ? over the course of the @entity32 revolution i read and heard of many horrific stories about the grave situation in the prisons			1
i never imagined it could be this bad			1
when he was arrested in january this year i knew that getting him released would not be easy			1
i realized all too well the struggle ahead of us			1
i panicked ; at one point i wished that he was killed but not arrested			1
no human being would want to be a guest in one of those prisons			1
nonetheless i , along with my family and friends , tried my best to reach to him			1
we paid an endless number of bribes and gifts to those people misleadingly called security men			1
they are anything but security men			1
heartless , cold , and vile are more fitting terms			1
we are not alone in this struggle ; thousands if not hundreds of thousands of @entity32 families are suffering the agonizing pain of having loved ones behind the bars of one of the security branches			1
the @entity70 legacy in brutality is most evident in those branches			1
the late dictator , @entity70 , the father of the current dictator , made a point of creating more security branches in @entity32 than olive tree branches			1
our journey to find my loved one and help him , or at least lessen his suffering , has uncovered ugly realities that we never acknowledged before			1
torture is not a new phenomenon to us but i did n't realize how widespread and vile it is			1
when one of his fellow inmates was released he came to visit us and told us that the prison he was in was a hell hole			1
forty men are crammed in an extremely small room , stripped naked except for underwear and forbidden from showering			1
he said every day a ruthless commander would come in and call few names then declare : " come with me to be executed			1
" this was enough to keep every one of these men on edge every night			1
i think he spent his nights thinking if he will ever live the following day			2
according to his released fellow inmate , the dirty and unhygienic place led to a weird skin disease spreading between inmates			2
the food was very poor and the heat was overwhelming			2
despite the rather disturbing details of his situation we experienced a sense of relief because he was definitely alive			2
we tried everything , everyone and every possible route but we had no luck			2
he was n't involved in the events ; he was n't an activist so his arrest was a puzzle for us			2
we were @entity125 ve to try establishing the reason for his arrest ; after all , you do n't have to do anything to be arrested in @entity32			1
some people reported some of their family members were arrested and never returned over an argument with neighbors who were well connected			2
others said their relatives were taken by the security men for no apparent reason other than being from a liberated village or city , even if they were n't involved themselves in the events			2
the released inmate said he was arrested because he had an argument with a passenger who hired his taxi			2
when they got to one of the security barriers spread all over @entity32 , the passenger said to the security men that he was insulting the regime			1
that was enough to arrest him			2
the world is most concerned about the number of dead and refugees because their suffering is more evident			2
from my own experience i can say that those unjustly arrested men and women are suffering immensely , probably much more than refugees			2
in addition to torture , humiliation and degrading treatment , they are forbidden from seeing their families or having any form of communication with them			1
and for those families outside , the wait can not be more excruciating			2
i spent most of the last few months fighting the sense of helplessness and incapability			2
can you imagine knowing your loved one is going through so much pain and suffering and you can not do anything about it ? i prayed , cried , and sometimes tried to forget about him but i could n't			1
after a series of lies and misleading stories we were told that he was about to be released because of a presidential pardon			2
i felt slightly better but continued to try to find ways to get in touch with him or secure his release because i never trusted @entity70 before all of this brutality and wo n't ever trust him			2
my brother wrote that day on his @entity200 page : " pray for the prisoners , they have been given another lease of life			2
" this could n't be more true			2
those who come out of these places often say it feels like being born again			0
one prisoner sent a message to his mom through one of his released inmates to pray that he dies because he could n't take it anymore			0
she did and he died			0
a report issued recently by a human rights violation watchdog outlined the torture methods used in the @entity32 security branches			1
i could n't finish it			0
nobody can if they have one of their loved ones inside			1
the most shocking element of this report was that when a prisoner dies , his body sometimes is left with the inmates and nobody is allowed to touch him			0
one prisoner was hanged from his hands for a long time during which he witnessed the body of his friend decay on the floor and insects come in and out of his body for days			0
he died later , probably in front of other observers			0
i thought what we were going through was the ultimate pain			0
i was in the kitchen making coffee and felt that everybody around me was acting funny			0
there was an unexplained , awkward feeling among us			0
they knew the news and were finding the best way to break it to me			0
they knew how much i loved him			1
i made it even more difficult when i mentioned him exactly at that time and said that i missed him and looked forward to seeing him again			0
after many failed attempts , one of them plucked the courage and told said to me that he was dead			0
the regime had killed him			0
the pain was so sharp and immense , i felt as if somebody had physically stabbed me			0
i gasped for air and sat down			0
then a crazy feeling overcame me			0
i felt a sense of relief			0
he is not in pain anymore			0
he is not being tortured , he is not beaten until he bleeds , he is not being made to say that @entity270 is the only god			0
after the initial shock had elapsed i started asking questions			0
when ? how ? funeral ? then it hit me			0
this regime is capable of hurting us even after death			0
first of all he died two weeks before we knew about it and we only found out about it by chance			0
we bribed somebody to check his name and he found his name on the dead list			0
the bribed informer called one of our family members and asked her to go and collect his id and the death statement			0
forty years under the emergency law which allows security men to arrest anybody anywhere has made @entity32 obsessed with their ids , hoping they do n't get arrested due to errors in names			1
then a bitter horrible feeling crept over my entire body			0
the corpse ? where is his body ? they wrote in clear @entity10 text on the death statement " the body shall not be given to the family			0
" they did n't bother to write the cause of death			0
i knew all along that this regime is capable of everything and anything , nothing is too brutal or ruthless			0
but for a split second i hoped they 'd give us the body to bury			0
i understand them now all too well			0
not only does this regime cause you pain and suffering in knowing that your loved ones are probably wishing they die sooner than later , but it can also strip away from you the sense of closure you so much need in such case			1
i wanted to bury him			0
is this too much to ask ? i wanted to say goodbye and probably hug his body one last time			0
i wanted to lay him in peace			0
another bribe and we learnt he was buried in a mass grave			0
while the world debates whether to strike the @entity32 regime or not , this kind of suffering will continue .			1
