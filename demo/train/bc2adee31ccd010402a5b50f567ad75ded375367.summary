-- this is a tale of two cities tied together by two tornadoes of the most wicked order , the apocalyptic @entity3 -- and by acts of charity that followed			0
it demonstrates how one good turn -- or town -- deserves another			0
first , the town of @entity11 , @entity12 , got hit by a twister on april 27 , killing 41			1
so , like many others across the country , the residents in and around @entity15 , @entity16 , dispatched volunteers and relief goods to the @entity12 community			1
@entity22 of @entity15 even participated in a fund - raiser			2
" i got involved just by seeing that they needed the help in @entity11 , and a friend of mine started just a group of us : ' @entity11 , @entity12 , ' " @entity22 told @entity0			1
pastor @entity29 of @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity16 , just 16 miles from @entity15 , donated manpower to the @entity11 wreckage			1
" when the tornado happened in @entity11 , a sister church there in @entity36 ( @entity37 ) called and asked if we could bring our team to @entity11 and help out , " said @entity29			1
" so we got our team and got our tools and stuff and went down there to help out			0
" then , a month later , fortunes between the @entity11 and @entity15 were reversed			1
the single deadliest @entity45 twister since modern record - keeping began in 1950 ripped through @entity15 , killing 142 persons			1
it , too , was an @entity3 - 5			0
so the people of @entity11 and elsewhere in @entity12 returned @entity15 's favor			1
a truckload of water , diapers , baby food and other relief materials arrived saturday for the people of @entity15 , and the goods were being stored in a warehouse at @entity29 's church because @entity15 is too obliterated to house the supplies			1
the donations were delivered courtesy of the relief group @entity64 's for @entity11 and @entity65 of @entity66 , @entity12 , said @entity67 , a spokesman for @entity64 's			1
" sunday afternoon , we saw on the @entity69 that there was a storm that was about to hit @entity15 , and we wondered why we recognized that name so well , " @entity67 said			2
" we realized why we recognized it , " he said			0
@entity15 residents " sent down a giant truck of aid for the residents of @entity11 , " he said			1
so , the residents of @entity11 and other parts of @entity12 donated enough goods to fill two 53 - foot trucks and a 26 - foot truck , @entity67 said			1
the 26 - foot truck , with a @entity64 's banner saying " @entity84			2
@entity15 , @entity16 bound , " was eventually diverted to another tornado - wracked community in @entity87 , but the two bigger trucks continued on their mission to provide relief to @entity15 , @entity67 said			1
@entity67 was amazed at the outpouring of support for @entity15 , with donations arriving by the pickup load , leaving him in tears , he said			2
" these people have been through it and they know exactly what to bring , " from flashlights to batteries to baby bottles , @entity67 said of @entity11 residents ' donations			1
" it is part of our healing process to help someone who has been through the exact same thing that we had been through			0
that 's why so many people stepped up to the plate , " @entity112 said			0
" this movement is so large , so many people stepping up as individuals taking care of their neighbors , it 's a beautiful , beautiful thing to happen in this country , " @entity67 added			0
for @entity22 's part , she was volunteering for a @entity11 fund - raiser in @entity15 on the very day that the tornado ripped through her @entity16 town , she said			1
in dramatic fashion , she raised money by doing mini-photo shoots and managed to do 20 of them before disaster struck sunday , she said			0
" we managed to make it to safety probably five or 10 minutes before the tornado hit , " @entity22 said			0
@entity11 's mutual humanitarianism moved her , she said			2
" they just want to do whatever they can to help us , which is amazing to me			0
they 've gone through the exact same thing , not even a month ago , and are so willing to send truckloads of food and anything that we need down here , and they 're happy to do it , " @entity22 said			0
" they 've got our backs , and they 're completely supportive			0
" @entity29 , the pastor , said seeing the truckload of donations from @entity11 was " an emotional thing			2
" similar trucks from around the country arrived in @entity11 during his volunteer efforts there last month , he said			2
" you just go , ' wow , people care about people , ' and this tragedy almost pulls us together as a nation , " @entity29 said			0
said @entity67 : " it 's supernatural what has happened here as far as i 'm concerned			0
" @entity0 's @entity169 and @entity170 contributed to this report .			0

a tornado hits @entity11 , @entity12 , in april
the residents in and around @entity15 , @entity16 , provide aid
then the nation 's deadliest twister *devastates* @entity15 in may
in a reversal of fortunes , @entity11 sends aid to @entity15
