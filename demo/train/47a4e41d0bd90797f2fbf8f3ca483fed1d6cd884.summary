it 's a decision thousands of protesters feared			1
@entity3 's powerful @entity2 voted sunday to change the way @entity5 picks its chief executive , ruling that only candidates approved by a nominating committee will be allowed to run			1
a top @entity3 official made clear the candidates all must " love the country and love @entity5			1
" the city 's current leader insists it 's a step in the right direction			1
" the majority of @entity5 citizens , namely , the 5 million qualified voters of the selection of chief executive in 2017 , will be able to cast their votes to select the chief executive , " said @entity5 chief executive leung chun - ying			2
speaking at an event monday to explain the @entity26 's decision , he added : " this is the first opportunity -- a very good opportunity -- for @entity5 to have one man , one vote -- universal suffrage			1
this is something we should all feel proud of			0
" but that 's not how @entity5 's pro-democracy @entity35 movement sees it			1
the group has vocally pushed for elections in which any candidate can run for chief executive			2
for weeks , protesters have taken to the streets			2
in a statement on its website , the group slammed @entity45 's decision as a move that stifles democracy and blocks people with different political views from running for office			1
" genuine universal suffrage includes both the rights to elect and to be elected , " the statement said			0
" the decision of the @entity2 has deprived people with different political views of the right to run for election and be elected by imposing unreasonable restrictions , thereby perpetuating ' handpicked politics			0
' " scores of people -- including pro-beijing groups and pro-democracy supporters -- gathered at the city 's @entity63 monday where the city 's decision - makers were meeting			1
local media reported chaotic scenes at the conference center as pan-democrats attempted to disrupt an address by @entity74 , deputy secretary general of the @entity2			0
freedoms eroded under the " one country , two systems " policy , the 7 million residents of @entity5 -- defined as a " @entity77 " of @entity3 -- are afforded greater civil liberties than those in the mainland			2
this reflects an agreement reached between @entity3 and the @entity86 before the handover , which promised @entity5 a " high degree of autonomy " for 50 years after its return			2
but the decision to change the way @entity5 picks its leader comes amid increasing fears that those freedoms are being eroded			2
currently , @entity5 's leader is chosen by an election committee selected mostly by @entity45 loyalists			1
@entity45 brushed aside demonstrators ' demands for a fully open election in 2017 , saying the decision to change the system is in line with @entity5 's basic law			1
protesters demands are self - serving , one top official said			0
" those people 's so - called international standards are tailored for themselves , " said @entity74 , deputy secretary general of the @entity2			0
" they are not the international standards , but their personal standards			0
" civil disobedience throngs of pro-democracy protesters rallied in central @entity5 on sunday to condemn @entity45 's decision and promised there would be more protests			1
the threat of civil disobedience " is our bargaining power , " @entity121 , the organizer of @entity35 , told @entity122 earlier this month			1
" they take us seriously , though they will never admit that			0
" after a massive rally calling for democracy in the @entity3 territory in july , hundreds of demonstrators -- including prominent lawmakers -- were arrested			0
tens of thousands of demonstrators protesting @entity35 marched in @entity5 earlier this month			1
local media swirled with reports of marchers getting paid or bused in to attend the pro-government march			0
the march 's organizer said he took the accusations seriously and would investigate but maintained that no laws were broken			0
' paper tiger ' but a commentary published monday by the state - controlled @entity144 dismissed this opposition and suggested @entity5 's political reforms had come to a " foregone conclusion			1
" " the radical opposition camp is doomed to be a paper tiger in front of @entity5 's mainstream public opinion and the firm resolution of the central government , " it said			1
" these radicals could indeed incite a group of people to rally with them but they are facing a powerful will and a strong legal framework that @entity5 must remain stable			2
they will definitely be called to account if they resort to illegal confrontation			0
and if they raise objections in a legal way , their efforts will end in vain			0
" meanwhile , @entity166 - on has been re-elected uncontested as @entity168 's chief executive			0
like nearby @entity5 , @entity168 is a " @entity77 " of @entity3 , following its transition from @entity171 control in 1999			2
the territory has itself faced calls for greater democracy , though its constitution makes no mention of universal suffrage			0
a recent unofficial poll on this question was shut down by police and several pro-democracy organizers were arrested for allegedly breaching privacy laws .			0
