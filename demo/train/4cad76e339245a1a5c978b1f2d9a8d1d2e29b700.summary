-- in 1992 , the @entity3 ' @entity2 label introduced the world to @entity5 , the @entity7 rock - punk - funk - hip - hop - disco - electro - indie band made up of singer / bassist @entity8 , singer / guitarist @entity5 , drummer @entity10 , and keyboardist @entity11			1
they released four albums and their biggest song to date , " @entity15 , " hit the top 40 chart			1
they appeared in quintessential ' 90s pop culture like the " @entity24 " soundtrack , the " @entity21 " tv series and even their own gap ad before amicably disbanding in 2000 because @entity8 wanted to have children and did n't think that the life of a touring musician would be conducive to that			1
today , @entity8 , @entity29 and @entity10 are mothers and recently reunited for a new @entity5 album			1
instead of going the traditional label route , they decided to put out their new material with the help of their fans through @entity38			1
their new single " are you ready ? " is out now and they 're currently hard at work on the full album , giving little sneak peeks along the way			1
this week they tweeted that they 're recording a new song called " @entity49			1
" " like that ' 70s disco song ' here in the twilight			1
" @entity0 spoke to @entity8 and @entity29 about reuniting in a changing musical landscape , why their kids hate when they sing and the best advice the @entity3 ever gave them			1
@entity0 : it 's been an exciting couple of years for fans of ' 90s music with a bunch of those band reuniting			1
was that a factor in putting out new @entity5 music ? @entity8 : i hope there 's nostalgia , that 's great , but it has nothing to do with what we 're doing			1
it 's just because the time is exactly right to do it			1
five years ago , there was n't this type of social network connection , connectivity			1
i think now people really miss that spirit of another time			1
people were really sad to hear we broke up and i guess now those people realizing that we 're reuniting and they 're writing about how happy they are			1
@entity0 : how has it been to get yourselves back out there ? @entity8 : it 's so hard to build yourself into a national brand of any kind			1
we 're fortunate that we have a name so we can go back there			1
with @entity97 , artists are realizing they can create their own fan base and reconnect with them			1
getting the mailing list back from the label , getting the @entity103 , getting the @entity104			1
then it becomes an @entity107 thing , where you 're calling the shots			1
that 's what we hope we 'll ultimately be			1
we get to put out our music ourselves , run it ourselves , tour as we wish			1
it 's a really great feeling			1
@entity0 : do you have an album title yet ? @entity8 : not yet			1
i think the core of the album needs to be made and then we 'll understand what it is			1
i think " are you ready ? " is a really good example of what it 's going to be like			1
it 'll have a range , but a fun , up - tempo , youth vibe			1
i think we 're both feeling that fun 's really important			1
we 're older now so the lyrics are different			1
there probably wo n't be cursing			2
i was listening to the old stuff and there was a lot of cursing			2
i 'm not feeling like curses in my lyrics right now			2
but i do n't feel like an old person			2
it 's definitely not like , oh , we 're adult contemporary now			2
@entity0 : @entity5 albums are known for their eclectic mix of genres and references , is that what fans can expect with the new album ? @entity8 : now we 're not using samples because it 's too expensive and no one does , but there 's core people that we are and that 's what we bring			1
our mission was to infuse ( the music ) with a lot of influences			2
we were like , how could we add that cool funk riff in ? why not put in this reggae guitar ? so that 's where it comes from , but i do n't think we 'll go crazy with anything drastically new			1
@entity5 : death metal ! @entity0 : will there be any collaborations on the new album ? @entity8 : @entity176 is back together , that could be really cute			1
they were always around with us			2
a lot of people are still doing music , @entity183 , the @entity2 people			2
we could collaborate with anybody			2
i saw @entity187 ( @entity188 of the @entity3 ) recently , so maybe down the road			1
you 're hitting us at the beginning stages			2
@entity0 : what music currently inspires you ? @entity8 : i love the @entity194 and @entity195 tracks and they 're not that far to me from what we 've always done			2
they 're some of the best tracks i 've heard in the last umpteen years			2
@entity195 passed away , but when i hear that stuff , i 'm like , aaaaah ! you know how you get when you 're really inspired ? that 's how i get when i heard those tracks , and the singing is great too			2
@entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208			2
i listen to a lot of pop with my kids , like @entity213 and @entity214			2
those are probably my favorite female pop artists , but i would n't say i 'll bring that into the new album			1
i like to dance around the house , just myself , and i 'll put that on			1
i 've done that since i was a teenager			2
@entity29 : @entity222 and @entity223 , those were huge influences in my life			2
@entity8 : huge , huge			2
i was watching @entity223 with my daughters and they were like , how could you like this ? i do n't get this			2
kids do n't understand if it does n't have a pop hook on it			2
@entity29 : when they 're really little , you can play them a great @entity237 song			0
then they want to like whatever anyone else likes			0
@entity0 : do your kids listen to your music ? @entity8 : mine have started to listen to our music , and they heard it when they were younger			0
they hate me singing , so it 's kind of a problem			0
@entity29 : all kids hate their parents singing			0
@entity8 : because it takes the attention off of them , that 's what i think			0
@entity0 : how has the band had to adapt to the changing music industry ? @entity8 : i do n't think anyone understands the music business right now			0
having been in it for 10 years , everyone sits around and talks about what it is			0
that 's the damn truth			0
we had some cool people promoting us			0
i look back and ca n't believe how savvy they were marketing us			0
the stuff that we did was really hip and cool and underground			0
they did n't pressure us to do anything particularly commercial			0
we dressed how we wanted			0
that was the biggest limit was , do n't do something wack			0
by wack , we all knew what that meant : something incredibly cheesy			0
i love cheesy music myself , like @entity282 , but i 'm talking about that mainstream commercial cheese and the sexy dancing and all that crap			0
we were never told to anything like that			0
i imagine now , you 'd be pressured to be wack left and right			0
@entity29 : now we 're really , really sexy , so we 're going to pull it out now			0
@entity8 : we 're going to be in our leotards by the end of this			0
that 's going to be the name of the album ! @entity0 : what is your favorite @entity5 album ? @entity8 : i like all our old albums			1
i do n't feel like we had that crappy album			1
@entity29 : they were all of the time			0
@entity8 : the only thing we did was make a video and almost kill ourselves roller derbying			0
i showed my kids the video and they were like , your outfits are horrible			0
i was like , those are roller derby outfits ! i was n't trying to look like a glamazon			0
somebody just put a roller derby outfit on me ; sorry i do n't look like @entity213 in the video			1
at one point the director was sitting there with his head in hands , like , what have i done ? and then these roller derby women come out and they smacked everyone around			0
she got an injury in her neck			0
@entity29 : you play music and you record the video , but you do n't want to be so incredibly challenged physically			0
cunniff : ( director ) @entity331 was incredible			0
she really got our vibe			0
she did " @entity336 , " " @entity335 " and " @entity334			0
" we did a ton of videos with other people , but those were probably our favorite			0
the " @entity344 " video , we totally looked like hookers			0
we thought we looked like " @entity345			0
" @entity29 : no. hookers			0
@entity0 : @entity5 was introduced through @entity2 and the @entity3 so that was great , automatic validation , but do you ever resent being asked about them when talking about your music ? @entity8 : not at all			1
as the years go by , i become more appreciative of what they did and how it was done , what they tried to do with @entity2			0
it was a noble effort to bring out new artists that were interesting and create a community of music that was creative			0
there 's not that many people doing that			0
they never really were part of our music ; they were more like mentors in the professional world of music			0
@entity0 : what was the best advice they ever gave you ? @entity8 : do n't be wack			0

@entity5 have recently reunited for a new album
they decided to put out their new material with the help of their fans through @entity38
their new single " are you ready ? " is out now
