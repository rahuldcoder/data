@entity0 -- @entity2 , a 3 - year - old who lives in the @entity3 , can barely walk or talk because of a failing kidney and liver			0
for much of her life , the @entity7 child has needed dialysis to survive			2
thankfully , an @entity11 man has been able to help her get the treatment she so desperately requires			2
more than 500 times in the past two years , @entity14 and his volunteers have driven @entity2 and her mother roundtrip from a checkpoint near the @entity3 border to @entity20 , which is an hour away in @entity21 , @entity11			1
" what @entity14 has done , no one else has done , " said @entity2 's mother , @entity22			2
" he is day by day helping us to get her to the hospital			0
i 'm not allowed to drive an @entity11 car , so if not for @entity14 , we would n't be able to transport her			1
" leaving the @entity3 is the only way @entity2 's family can get dialysis			0
for one thing , medical facilities are limited in the territory			0
" in the @entity39 , it 's very expensive to get health care , and most of the people can not afford it , " @entity14 said			1
it 's also expensive to make the trip to @entity11 hospitals			1
although the @entity39 allows sick children and adults to leave the @entity3 for treatment , @entity7 are not allowed to drive past the checkpoints			2
to get to @entity11 hospitals , they 'd have to take a taxi , which would cost at least $ 90 each way			1
fortunately , there is @entity14 and his organization , @entity55 ( " @entity56 " )			2
since 2006 , @entity14 and his team of volunteers have been giving palestinians a lifeline			2
" the volunteers are driving at least five days a week , " said @entity14 , a 55 - year - old carpenter and professional juggler from @entity62 , @entity11			1
" some ( drive ) in the morning to drop off patients , and others come in the evening to take them back			0
that makes the whole thing easy , since they can still go to work and do n't have to spend the whole day			0
" for @entity14 , the transportation service is a way to recover from personal tragedy			2
in 1993 , his brother @entity73 was kidnapped and killed by members of @entity75			1
after his loss , @entity14 found a way to channel his anger into peace			2
" i heard an interview on @entity11 radio with a man who lost his son in the same way that i lost my brother , " @entity14 said			1
" after the interview , i called him ... and he said he had an idea to establish a group to encourage dialogue between bereaved families from both sides , @entity11 and @entity7			1
" @entity14 joined the group , called @entity92 , and befriended many @entity7			1
@entity93 shared a surprisingly common need : transportation access to @entity11 health - care facilities			1
" one day , ( a program participant ) called and told me his brother might have a brain tumor			0
he had an appointment at @entity20 but no way to go , " @entity14 said			0
" he asked if i could drive him , and i agreed it would be no problem			0
" that first call for help was more than four years ago			0
as word of @entity14 's generosity spread , transportation demands grew , and @entity14 began to recruit his friends as driver - volunteers			1
today , @entity14 's group has grown to 200 volunteers			1
transport coordination efforts are run entirely by @entity14 , who spends many hours on his cell phone inquiring about the location of volunteers and @entity7 families			1
each volunteer maintains his or her own vehicle , but @entity14 helps cover gasoline costs with donation money he has received			0
do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2011 @entity127 even though differences exist , including some language barriers , @entity14 believes that the program helps @entity11 and @entity7 learn from and respect each other			1
" when we are coming to pick up the sick kids , the ( @entity7 and @entity11 ) checkpoint managers help us a lot , " @entity14 said			1
" it makes our life and their life a lot easier			0
i think @entity7 families trust me also because i 'm coming as one of them			0
i feel like they are my family or my friends			0
" @entity14 's group has driven an estimated 90,000 kilometers ( about 55,000 miles ) in 2010 alone			1
he says they have helped hundreds of @entity7 get access to health care			1
" i lost my brother , but i did n't lose my head , " @entity14 said			2
" this activity gives me an essence for life			0
i have learned the price of the conflict is a lot more than the price of making peace			0
we are all human beings			0
" want to get involved ? e-mail @entity56 to recovery at @entity162 for more information			0
@entity1 's @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 contributed to this report .			0

@entity14 started a service that transports sick @entity7 to @entity11 hospitals
many of these @entity7 lack access to the health care they need to survive
@entity14 's brother @entity73 was killed by @entity75 in 1993 , but he still wants to help others
