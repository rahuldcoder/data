first printing , launched on the book world 's version of a @entity8 , where @entity9 is @entity10 and @entity11 is @entity12 of the @entity14 cognoscenti			1
in today 's political market , well before it was officially released , " @entity15 " was reduced to a pinprick - sized , petty insiders squabble			1
how do we square these disparate perspectives ? as a person with alternating publisher and political hats , who knows the players but was n't inside the @entity28 campaign , who cares deeply about the current conservative movement and the future of the country ( which are inextricably intertwined ) , may i offer a few thoughts to the friends on @entity0 's site ? the publishing " frenzy " full disclosure : @entity39 , an imprint of @entity41 , ( for which i serve as editor - in - chief , a misnomer of a title , since my editing is confined to reading ; for you political types , think , " operative / organizer " ) would have loved to acquire @entity50 's book			1
she did n't really shop it and it 's not certain we would have paid what she was reputed to have commanded , but upon notice she was considering writing , we , like the rest of the book world , were in a frenzy at the prospect of publishing it			1
many were prepared to offer @entity50 's lawyer , @entity63 , their first - born male child for it			1
we are now all watching very closely how it plays out ( and more precisely , " earns - out " ) in a book market that 's unpredictable and fickle always , but in major transition today			1
the pre-orders immediately kicked it onto the best - seller lists , but a dirty little secret of publishing ( where spin is as prevalent as in politics ) is not all best - sellers earn out ( i.e. , the publisher sells enough books to cover an author 's advance , which is the threshold for making a profit )			1
" @entity15 " will now be a " comp " ( or baseline ) for assessing the value of and advances for political " big books , " so all you big book writers of the future better hope it sells big -- or your future advances wo n't be			1
" the @entity91 " on to politics			0
while having your own title is now de rigueur for politicians and policy makers , and the upshot is usually no harm - no foul , the goals of the publishing and political worlds are not always in tandem			1
though there is much , much more in @entity50 's book that fleshes out her inner core , her grounding in faith and family , as well as her policy achievements and forward - thinking philosophical framework of common sense conservatism , so far the coverage of it has constrained her in a defensive backward - focused box , re-litigating the darkest days of the campaign and reliving difficult family moments			1
though all the breathless chatter about 2012 is premature , the way @entity50 lays out her world view throughout the book and especially in the eloquent closing pages is sure to attract conservatives yearning for an unapologetic articulation of first principles			1
but because of the inordinate mainstream media focus on the political insiders ' tiff , the @entity91 is getting sucked down and mucked up by the @entity130			1
listening to her on @entity131 as i write , she is digging out of the box her detractors would like to bury her in for once and all and needs to keep on it : get off their message and onto her own			0
now , for a point of personal privilege			0
i have been and will continue to be an advocate of @entity50 and her principles			1
had i been asked about how to use her publishing opportunity to maximum political benefit , i would have proffered to @entity50 the received wisdom of the unlikely duet of my mother and @entity149 : never burn bridges			1
as campaign memoirs go , " @entity15 " napalms bridges , incinerates detractors , hoses gas on what were smoldering embers			0
it is without refutation anywhere , even among rabid @entity50 haters , that she received political hazing of a magnitude previously unimaginable			1
more mother wisdom : two wrongs do n't make a right ( to which my @entity167 - loving daughter always replies , " yes , but three rights make a left " )			0
there was a way to defend her honor , make her case , pivot to the future while showcasing her moral foundation by doing unto others as she wished they had done unto her , so to speak			2
campaign pressure cooker anyone who has ever been in the @entity185 pressure cooker of a national campaign knows that " mistakes are made , " feelings are hurt , tempers are short , bitching is background noise			0
there is no such thing as @entity192 for political campaigns			1
except for maybe @entity195 , good manners do not exist on any campaign planet			2
for good reason : they take time			1
time is the most valuable commodity on a campaign and you just ca n't waste it thinking about how to choose your words carefully or get your job done more diplomatically			2
if someone is n't in tears every day , that day was n't all it could be advancing the campaign			0
i once witnessed an experienced ( big ) man slap a professional female colleague across the face over an ad buy ... and no one thought anything of it , starting with the woman			0
in fact , she would have been insulted if anyone told her she should have been insulted			0
though the two primary @entity50 antagonists , @entity28 campaign senior strategists @entity223 and @entity224 , have said little about the @entity227 cocktails thrown at them in " @entity15 " ( other than a true @entity223 , aka , " @entity228 , " retort , " why are the bald guys always the villains ? " ) , both have made it clear the accounts of their actions in " @entity15 " are " fiction			1
" and while i was n't there , i have worked with and adore them both			0
they are uniquely talented , cool under fire , cutting - edge creative professionals , admired and respected by their peers of all political persuasions and their many high - level bosses			2
and ironically , however it ended , the relationship began as a match made in heaven			0
both @entity223 and @entity224 were ecstatic with @entity50 's selection as vice presidential nominee ; and both were appalled at the outrageous , unspeakable , unparalleled media treatment heaped on @entity50 and her family			1
@entity223 , normally the toughest guy in the room , called me at home on multiple occasions , just flabbergasted and flummoxed about how to protect @entity50 and her family and , of course keep the campaign on track			2
he was in genuine pain for her -- not a good state of mind or use of energy for the campaign guru , which he knew -- but he devoted much concentration to the astounding set of circumstances			2
that @entity50 recalls her experience with them so negatively and ugly incidents so vividly does not make her a liar , as people with neither her nor the party 's best interests in mind have charged			1
the operating principle of campaigns , perception is reality , works inside as well as outside			2
once her perception of reality locked in negatively , particularly on @entity223 and @entity281 , there was only one prism through which all their actions flowed			0
and it was n't pretty			0
i have seen this phenomenon on countless campaigns and in the @entity289			2
it is unavoidable in any operation that is always under stress , where clearing - the - air sessions are n't possible given time or physical constraints			2
that campaign people tend to be uncommonly focused , which can come off as insensitive , might exaggerate the perception , but it is just an occupational hazard			0
the plight of the number two another common source of campaign discomfort is the role of the @entity306 ( that 's vice president of the @entity309 ) candidate			2
it is always secondary to the potus in every respect			0
his / her operation is always subservient to the principal one			0
they do not set strategy or adjust message ; they are assigned to b markets			0
they are an echo chamber			0
they do not give unique speeches unless they are given a specific and pointed attack , which might appear unseemly coming from the principal			0
granted , @entity50 was a unique nominee , with uncommon charisma and fire - power , but number two is number two			2
it was ever thus and will ever be			0
adjusting to being number two , after being number one ( as a governor ) is a process			0
even if you were never number one , it is a trial -- witness @entity339 , in perpetual adjustment mode			0
bottom line : the book is a good read , an unusually detailed front - row seat view to how strained campaigns always are , and a compelling insight into @entity50 's perspective			1
its long - term publishing and political impact are unknown for now , though as @entity50 moves out of the mainstream media monster publicity machine and into more hospitable , relevant political terrain , the prospects for success on both fronts improve exponentially			1
but its impact on personal and professional relationships is a sad one indeed and one i hope conservatives do n't let it divide us just when we are marching toward a promising midterm , which reflects an ascendant common - sense conservatism and requires all the good guys in the foxhole together			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity369 .			2

@entity50 's book is a publishing *blockbuster* and " a good read , " says @entity369
she says in the political world , the @entity50 book is being reduced to an insider spat
she says her advice would have been to focus the book on the future , not the past
campaigns are rough , and there 's no time for diplomacy , @entity369 says
