@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity1 judiciary said wednesday it is considering a request for setting bail in the case of two @entity8 hikers convicted of spying and sentenced to eight years in prison			1
" the two @entity8 nationals accused of spying have not been released and their attorneys ' requests for setting bail is being considered , " the judiciary said			0
the statement , posted on the judiciary 's website , seems to contradict accounts previously given by the hikers ' attorney and @entity1 president @entity23			1
attorney @entity24 said tuesday his clients , @entity26 and @entity26 , would be released from @entity0 's @entity10 after a $ 500,000 bail was paid for each of them			1
on wednesday , an @entity32 plane was en route to @entity0 carrying an @entity32 official who will be working on any negotiation , a @entity30 diplomat told @entity2			1
but it was not clear whether the hostages would be free to leave , the source said			0
@entity26 and @entity26 have been held for more than two years			0
they and a third hiker , @entity26 , were arrested july 31 , 2009 , after apparently straying across an unmarked border between @entity41 and @entity1 while hiking in northern @entity41 's @entity43 region			1
they said they were unaware they had crossed into @entity1 , but @entity1 authorities said they were spies who entered the country illegally			2
@entity26 , who is @entity26 's fiancee , was released last year for medical reasons , although authorities said her case remains open			0
last month , @entity26 and @entity26 were convicted and sentenced to eight years in prison -- five years for espionage and three years for illegal entry , according to @entity1 media			2
in an interview with @entity59 that aired tuesday , @entity23 said the hikers could be released " in a couple of days " but did not mention bail			1
the president suggested there is a need for the @entity8 to release @entity1 held in its jails			2
" ok , these two persons will be released , " @entity23 said			2
" is it going to be over ? we do it , for example , in ( a ) humanitarian gesture			0
is it going to solve the problems ? i hope so			0
" but in the statement posted wednesday , the judiciary said that " the case is currently being considered by the presiding judge , and any related news will be given by the judiciary			2
" " no other source is entitled to provide news about this case , " it said			0
the contradictory information may point to a long - simmering rift in the @entity1 government			1
in @entity1 , the clerics , not the president , control the courts			2
in addition , the hikers may have become a political hot potato in @entity1			1
in april , a public spat erupted between @entity23 and @entity1 's supreme leader , ayatollah @entity96			1
top officials and media outlets close to @entity96 criticized the president , and several of his top aides were reportedly arrested , one for " sorcery			0
" on april 17 , @entity23 fired intelligence minister @entity102 , and @entity96 vetoed the move			2
the president publicly denied any disagreement			0
but public criticism has also targeted one of @entity23 's in - laws and chief of staff , @entity109			1
he and several others in the government are considered by @entity1 's hardliners to have strayed from the path of revolution and the direction set by @entity96 , as well as the late ayatollah @entity116 , who led the @entity118 in @entity1			1
@entity109 's nationalistic statements and his alleged contacts with the @entity121 , including the @entity8 , have caused the clerics and the hardliners to launch an open campaign against him			0
they are reluctant , however , to attack @entity23 directly , as @entity96 supported him after his re-election , according to a political analyst			2
the heads of two of @entity1 's three branches of government , meanwhile , are brothers -- @entity132 is the speaker of parliament , and ayatollah @entity134 is the head of the judiciary			1
the two may well attempt to thwart what they consider to be anti-cleric and anti-revolutionary actions by @entity109 , who is close to @entity23 , the analyst said			0
separately , a human rights group issued a statement criticizing @entity23 for using the hikers as political pawns			1
" @entity23 is trying to use the hikers ' release for political gains on the international stage , " said @entity145 , spokesman for the @entity146			1
" no one should be fooled			0
the question is , why were these young men deprived of their liberty for so long on trumped - up charges and without proper judicial proceedings ? moreover , why is n't anyone held accountable for this injustice ? " the organization said it welcomed the news of the hikers ' possible release , but noted they have been held for more than two years " without any substantive evidence supporting the espionage charges against them			0
their detention and sudden release is seemingly another example of politically motivated arrests and prosecutions by the @entity1 judiciary and impunity for officials that bend @entity1 laws and violate human rights			1
" @entity179 issued a statement wednesday calling for the hikers ' immediate release			0
" the @entity1 authorities must stop treating @entity26 and @entity26 as pawns -- both in their dealings with the @entity8 government and in domestic political rivalries , " said @entity183 , @entity179 's deputy director for the @entity184 and @entity185			1
" all available evidence and the authorities ' conduct throughout the trial suggests that the @entity1 authorities have known all along that these men were not spies , " he said			0
" rather , it appears they were probably held in order to try to gain political concessions from the @entity8			0
" @entity2 's @entity201 and @entity202 contributed to his report .			0
