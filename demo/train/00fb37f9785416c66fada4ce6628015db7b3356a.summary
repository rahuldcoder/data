-- thank you , @entity2 , for stepping up and being a real man			1
a real man is honest and confident and can look the world in the eye and take responsibility for his own life			0
real men can stand up to religious zealots who believe that they have the right to stand in judgment of others			0
you are exactly the right man at the right time to help break down the stereotypes about gays in professional sports			0
and kudos to the @entity23 commissioner @entity22 for working tirelessly over decades to create a workplace environment that is inclusive and diverse across many cultural issues , including sexual orientation			1
" @entity2 has been a widely respected player and teammate throughout his career , and we are proud he has assumed the leadership mantle on this very important issue , " the commissioner said monday			2
having worked in sports for two decades and having been a straight ally for most of my adult life , i know this day did n't come just because president @entity37 and other politicians say it 's ok to be gay			2
sure , having the topic of @entity43 equality in the public conversation is an important part of changing a culture , but it has been the everyday people with the courage to advocate for equality and break down hostile environments that make a day like monday possible			0
the @entity23 , more than any other professional men 's sports league , has worked to create a culture that supports gay athletes			1
no doubt , there will be critics and ugly accusations thrown at @entity2			0

@entity76 : kudos to @entity23 player @entity2 for coming out publicly
@entity79 : @entity23 head @entity22 worked for decades to create an inclusive environment
@entity79 : because of @entity22 , it was " no big deal " when @entity84 's @entity83 came out
