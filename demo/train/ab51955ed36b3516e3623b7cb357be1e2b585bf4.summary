@entity0 -- former @entity3 chief @entity2 was granted bail thursday after being indicted on charges related to the alleged assault of a maid in his @entity0 hotel saturday			1
" it 's a great relief to the family to be able to have him with them , " defense attorney @entity10 said to reporters outside the courtroom			2
he said his client would spend thursday night at the jail on @entity18 before being released friday			1
the next court appearance , an arraignment , is slated for june 6			2
@entity22 judge @entity21 granted the bail on the condition that @entity2 post $ 1 million in cash , that he also post a bond for $ 5 million , that he surrender his travel documents and that he submit to home detention			1
the announcement came shortly after his indictment on seven criminal charges was announced			2
they are : two counts of criminal sexual act , two counts of sexual abuse , and one count each of attempt to commit rape , unlawful imprisonment and forcible touching			0
in the charge of criminal sexual act in the first degree , @entity2 is accused of having " engaged in oral sexual conduct with an individual ... by forcible compulsion , " the indictment says			1
" under @entity53 law , these are extremely serious charges , " manhattan district attorney @entity48 told reporters outside the courtroom			0
" the defendant was indicted on all the charges presented to the grand jury , " he said			0
@entity2 resigned from his @entity3 post on wednesday			1
as he entered the courtroom for the bail hearing , he looked at his wife , seated in the front row , and smiled			2
@entity2 on monday had been denied bail , with the criminal court judge saying his attempt to leave the country after the alleged incident made him a flight risk			1
his lawyer argued thursday that @entity2 had been scheduled to leave @entity0 and fly to @entity69 on saturday using a ticket he had bought on may 11			1
@entity10 said @entity2 had called the @entity72 hotel from @entity73 to locate his cell phone , which he had left in the hotel , then called a second time as his plane was boarding to request that its delivery be hastened			1

" he has one interest at this time and that is to clear his name			0
" @entity10 added that @entity2 had agreed to live with his wife in an apartment in @entity97 after his release			1
prosecutor @entity99 argued the high - profile economist had no right to bail			2
" while there is presumption of innocence , the proof is substantial and it is growing every day , " he said , adding that the forensic evidence is consistent with an attack and the alleged victim has identified @entity2 as her attacker			1
@entity110 noted that @entity111 does not extradite its own nationals , and said @entity2 's departure on saturday from the hotel was in haste , suggesting " something went on in that hotel room			1
" for his part , @entity21 said he was solely concerned about ensuring @entity2 returns to face charges			1
" we do n't want his money , " he said			0
" we just want to make sure he comes back			0
he has resources to live comfortably in his own country			0
" as the hearing recessed , @entity2 blew his wife a kiss			1
meanwhile , @entity2 's alleged victim , a 32 - year - old @entity127 maid for the @entity72 hotel , testified before the grand jury on wednesday , according to an attorney representing her			1
" if you 've had any experience with someone who has been traumatized by sexual assault , reliving it in your mind is hard enough , " attorney @entity131 said on @entity1 's " @entity132			0
" having to recount it , even to a therapist , is difficult , much less having to talk about it on the record in front of a grand jury			0
i mean , it 's extremely difficult , and nonetheless she 's making it through this			0
" the case has set @entity111 political circles abuzz , as the international economist was widely considered the @entity154 's best hope to unseat president @entity155 in next year 's elections			0
in a statement released thursday , @entity155 called @entity2 's resignation " inevitable " and called for an " open and transparent selection process " for @entity2 's replacement			1
in a brief letter to the @entity3 executive board late wednesday , @entity2 proclaimed his innocence			1
he said he was stepping down to " protect this institution which i have served with honor and devotion , and especially -- especially -- i want to devote all my strength , all my time and all my energy to proving my innocence			0
" " to all , i want to say that i deny with the greatest possible firmness all of the allegations that have been made against me , " he said			0
in his letter , @entity2 said he felt compelled to resign			1
" i think at this time first of my wife -- whom i love more than anything -- of my children , of my family , of my friends , " he wrote			0

" we want to see an open process that leads to a prompt succession for the fund 's new managing director			0
" in statements , @entity198 called for a candidate from a developing country to be named as @entity2 's successor , while @entity203 called for establishing criteria and conducting a thorough search			1
on thursday , @entity183 urged policy makers to work together to strengthen the global economy			2
" i deeply regret the circumstances that have made it necessary for me to substitute for the fund 's managing director , " @entity183 said in a speech at the annual meeting of the @entity209 in @entity210			0
prosecutors allege that a naked @entity2 , 62 , chased the housekeeping employee through his suite and sexually assaulted her			1
but defense attorney @entity218 disputed the allegation , saying " forensic evidence , we believe , will not be consistent with a forcible account , and we believe there is a very , very defensible case			0
" @entity2 allegedly committed the offenses at noon			1
he checked out of the hotel at 12:28 p.m. and went to a previously scheduled lunch about 12:45 p.m. , according to a document supporting his motion to approve bail			2
the lunch was with one of his daughters , according to a source with knowledge of the case			0
after lunch , he was driven to @entity73 and boarded an @entity239 flight that was scheduled to depart at 4:45 p.m. , the bail document says			2
as he sat in first class awaiting takeoff and a planned meeting the next day with @entity247 chancellor @entity246 in @entity248 , followed by a meeting with @entity251 finance ministers on monday in @entity252 , his world of power and privilege came crashing down			0
police , alerted by hotel staff to the employee 's accusations , ordered him off the plane and placed him in custody			0
@entity2 was examined for scratches and dna samples were taken , and investigators searched for other evidence in the suite , including possible bodily fluids from both individuals , a law enforcement official told @entity1			2
he consented to the testing after investigators prepared a search warrant , said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity			0
the official was not authorized to release the information			0
@entity2 became embroiled in sexual controversy soon after joining the @entity3 in september 2007			1
he acknowledged reports that he 'd had an improper physical relationship with a female employee			0
but the relationship was consensual , an independent inquiry found , and the @entity3 's executive board concluded in october 2008 that " there was no harassment , favoritism or any other abuse of authority by the managing director			2
" nevertheless , the board found " that the incident was regrettable and reflected a serious error of judgment , " the @entity3 said in a written statement			2
on thursday , the @entity3 sent reporters updated standards for staff conduct that were approved may 6			1
under the organization 's new policy on closer personal relationships in the workplace , a supervisor who has an intimate personal relationship with a subordinate must report that relationship to the ethics adviser , his or her supervisor or the human resources department " to seek resolution of potential conflict of interests and workplace fairness concerns , " the new standards say			0
