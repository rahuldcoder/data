-- @entity1 has canceled " @entity4 " after two seasons , but the rainy murder mystery could live on at another network			1
a statement from the network read : " after much deliberation , we 've come to the difficult decision not to renew ' @entity4 ' for a third season			0
@entity1 is incredibly proud of the show and is fortunate to have worked with such a talented team on this project , from showrunner @entity15 and our terrific partners at @entity17 to the talented , dedicated crew and exceptional cast			1
" @entity17 quickly sent out a statement saying the studio plans to shop the drama series to other networks : " @entity17 is extremely proud of ' @entity4 , ' the extraordinary writing staff and crew , and what we believe is one of the best casts on television			1
we will proceed to try to find another home for the show			0
" " @entity4 " has been one of @entity1 's few missteps in an otherwise remarkable plunge into scripted television during the last several years			1
the show premiered last year to 2.7 million viewers and plenty of fan and critic excitement			2
but in a move that will likely be used as a real - time lesson in serialized series management for years to come , @entity1 and @entity15 managed to infuriate fans by declining to solve a mystery that viewers felt they had been led to believe would be cleared up by the end of the first season			2
when season 2 debuted in april , ratings dropped 33 % to 1.8 million viewers			2
the audience continued to ebb until the finale , which garnered 1.4 million viewers and finally revealed who killed teen murder victim @entity55			1
with the ratings showing a clear downward trajectory , and having established across two seasons that the @entity61 murder is the driving force of the show , cancellation seemed very likely			0
the lesson ? do n't take viewers for granted			0
