-- one day , @entity1 jumped for joy after scoring a $ 1 million winner on an @entity5 lottery scratch ticket			1
the next month , he was dead			0
investigators initially ruled @entity1 's manner of death natural			1
but after being prompted by a relative , the medical examiner 's office in @entity11 , @entity5 , revisited the case and eventually determined there was a lethal amount of cyanide in @entity1 's system			1
" that ... led us to issue an amended death certificate that ( established ) cyanide toxicity as the cause of death , and the manner of death as homicide , " chief medical examiner dr. @entity18 said monday			1
why did @entity1 , an @entity29 immigrant who was described as a well - liked , hardworking and successful businessman , die ? and who is responsible ? finding that out is now up to the @entity34 police			1
no arrests have been made			2
" we are investigating it as a murder , and we 're working closely with the medical examiner 's office , " @entity34 police spokeswoman @entity36 said monday			1
on june 26 , @entity1 was all smiles at a @entity44 in the @entity46 section of @entity34			2
surrounded by his wife , daughter and friends , he held an oversized $ 1 million check and recalled his joy upon playing the " $ 3 million @entity52 ! " game , where tickets sell for $ 30 apiece			1
" i scratched the ticket , then i kept saying , ' i hit a million ! ' over and over again , " the 46 - year - old @entity1 said , according to a press release from the @entity56			1
" i jumped two feet in the air , then ran back into the store and tipped the clerk $ 100			0
" the plan , he explained , was to use the money for his mortgage , paying off bills , a donation to @entity66 and investing more in his dry cleaning businesses			0

he would have to wait a few weeks to collect his actual winnings , which amounted after taxes to about $ 425,000			2
according to @entity0 affiliate @entity75 , that check was issued july 19 , but @entity1 never got to spend it			0
the next night , @entity1 came home , ate dinner and went to bed , according to an internal police department document obtained by the @entity81			2
his family later heard him screaming and took him to a local hospital , where he was later pronounced dead , the paper reported , citing the document			0
that 's where the @entity11 medical examiner 's office came in , investigating @entity1 's death because it was " sudden and unexpected , " @entity86 said			1
at the time , there were no allegations of foul play or evidence of trauma			0
so , following the office 's policy , @entity1 's body underwent what @entity86 described as an " external examination ( and ) basic toxicology testing , " neither of which turned up anything abnormal			0
so the medical examiner ruled that @entity1 had died of arterial sclerotic cardiovascular disease -- which encompasses incidents like heart attacks , strokes and aortic ruptures -- and that his manner of death was natural , according to @entity113			1
a few days later , a family member approached the doctor who had examined the body " and said they felt uncomfortable that it was being ruled a natural and they suggested that we look into it further , " the chief medical examiner said			1
" so we did that , " he added			0
" forensics is not a static field			0
if new evidence comes to light , we 'll revisit cases			0
" that meant more in - depth toxicology tests			0
in early september , new screening results came back indicating cyanide in @entity1 's blood			2
with that , the official manner of death was changed from natural to pending , @entity86 said , and @entity34 police got involved			1
in late november , a more detailed blood analysis came back showing " a lethal level of cyanide , " and @entity1 's death became a murder case			1
@entity34 police have n't offered details , including a possible motive , about what they call an " ongoing investigation			1
" talking briefly with @entity0 affiliate @entity150 and the @entity81 , @entity1 's widow described her husband as kind and exemplary			0
@entity153 , who runs the @entity44 where the winning lottery ticket was sold , offered similarly glowing comments about @entity1			2
" i would never think that anybody ... would hurt him , " @entity153 told @entity75			0
" ( he was a ) nice person , very hopeful and gentle ( and ) very hardworking			0
