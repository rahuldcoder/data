-- " syndicate " tries to remake a ' 90s title into a modern - day , first - person shooter and as far as gameplay mechanics go , it succeeds			1
but , visually , the game falls so short that it ends up being far from an enjoyable experience			1
the new game from @entity9 and @entity10 is a reboot of a 1993 title that was more of a tactical shooter and strategy game than a first - person shooter			1
this version drops you into a future where corporations , not countries , control the world , and most of @entity24 's population has been implanted with chips in their brains			2
players act as techno - agents -- with super-charged chips designed to make them incredible warriors this @entity32 - 6 chip technology is implanted in the brain of your character , @entity35			1
@entity36 is tasked with sniffing out corporate espionage and dealing with it -- permanently			2
the @entity39 makes @entity36 more powerful and so fast that the world around him appears to be moving slower			2
he also gets additional enhancements early in the game that unleash three different powerful attacks -- suicide , backfire and persuade			1
each of these abilities allows @entity36 to tap into an enemy 's chip and force them to do something against their will			1
the " suicide " ability causes a brain chip to explode , possibly injuring surrounding people			1
" backfire " shorts out an opponent 's weapon temporarily and makes them vulnerable to damage			2
and " persuade " gets enemies to switch sides and help out @entity36 , before blowing their own brains out			1
@entity36 also gets upgrades by stealing important chips from other people 's skulls			0
the technique is rather disturbing , as the technology is removed through the ear or eye			0
it 's done after the people are already dead , so at least there 's that			0
these upgrades add to @entity36 's health and recharge his power , shields and other skills and tools you 'll need to complete your missions			1
from a shooter perspective , the action is solid with a wide range of weapons to collect and use			1
from a simple pistol to the powerful chain gun with infinite ammo , each weapon causes unique , and sometimes very visceral , damage			0
the chain gun literally cuts enemies in half			1
if you do n't have a strong stomach , do n't examine the bodies too closely			0
the enemies are numerous , so players will get plenty of practice with their weapons and abilities			1
some strategy is needed in most scenarios , but on more than one occasion , the bad guys just kept coming down a hallway without any personal regard while i continued to mow them down			1
the boss battles were lengthy and difficult , requiring quite a bit of dodging , restocking and flat - out hiding			1
@entity36 seems extraordinarily fragile for all his offensive firepower , so you will die often			0
civilians are n't immune to all the bullets flying around , but from a game - play perspective , it was hard to determine whether i should care			1
there 's no morality system that punishes or rewards player actions			0
i tried not to play like a psychopath , but the lines between good and bad get blurred on the way to the game 's conclusion			1
and speaking of blurred ... the visual elements of " syndicate " are , by far its most troubling			2
yes , it is supposed to be a far - flung future , reminiscent of " @entity139 " or even " @entity140			2
" but the way it 's rendered was visually painful			0
lens flare and extreme lighting made the game hard to enjoy			2
even after adjusting the gamma and blackness controls , transitions from scene to scene often resulted in blinding brightness or darkness so intense that , when i turned away , i could n't make out individual items on a desk			0
i spent more time in the video options menu than worrying about what skills i wanted to upgrade			0
@entity159 animation did n't help the visual experience , either			0
onscreen characters would develop a case of the shakes that made it look like they were going through @entity166			0
on more than one occasion , enemy soldiers would appear to go down , only to spontaneously reappear shooting in the same location			0
detail in the environments was impressive , but most of it was just for show			0
walls and barriers would show bullet marks but not take any real damage			0
the multiplayer mode teams up two to four players on fairly typical missions			1
cooperation is vital as the enemies appears single - minded in their desire to destroy you			1
it does n't detract from the overall game , but it is important to get with people who know what they are doing			2
those " solo " team members are just going to get themselves -- and you -- killed			0
overall , " syndicate " has solid , fun combat that requires creativity to overcome			2
but that 's hampered by its visual style and glitchiness			0
if you can get past that , do n't treat it as a reboot of the game you may have liked in the ' 90s			1
treat it as something new , and you 'll probably enjoy it more			0
" syndicate " is available now in @entity210 and february 24 in @entity211 on @entity212 , @entity213 and @entity214			2
it is rated m for mature because of blood and gore , intense violence , strong language and suggestive themes			0
this review was done using a review copy for the @entity214 .			0

the @entity32 - 6 chip adds to health , recharging , shields and other benefits to complete missions
