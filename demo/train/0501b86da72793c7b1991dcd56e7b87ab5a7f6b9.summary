-- a baseball tradition is about to end			2
this week , @entity2 announced it would no longer allow the use of chewing tobacco when fans are present			1
if you 've got it , says the league , you 've got to conceal it			2
since baseball became a professional sport in the mid- 19th century , players and coaches have been tucking tobacco between their gums and cheeks and spitting out brown saliva			1
it 's a ritual that has permeated the game			1
@entity21 coach @entity20 remembers the first time he was offered a " chaw " of tobacco , as they call it			1
it was 50 years ago when @entity20 left his junior year at @entity28 to sign a deal to play shortstop for the @entity32 ' minor league team			1
he got a $ 20,000 signing bonus			2
" everyone was chewing tobacco in the minors , " @entity20 says			1
" it was almost like an initiation			2
you knew the major leaguers did it			2
" and everyone in the minors dreamed of the majors , including @entity20			1
@entity20 ' first day on the team , an older player offered him some tobacco			1
why did so many players use it ? " i do n't know			2
maybe they thought it would help you be a better ballplayer			0
or maybe it just made you feel like a better ballplayer , " @entity53 recalls			2
it made me sick right out of the chute			0
" @entity20 played with the @entity32 farm team			1
just like his father , who played more than a decade in the minors , @entity20 dreamed of playing in the majors			1
he recalls a story about chewing tobacco that his father passed down that may shed light on the roots of that baseball tradition			1
" it was a couple years before i was born : around 1937 or ' 38 , shortly after they built the old ballpark in @entity71 , @entity72 , " @entity20 said			1
" my father was in the bullpen a lot			2
the ballpark 's right field wall backed up to the @entity78			2
young ladies who lived near the stadium would flirt with the guys in the bullpen and occasionally throw ' em tobacco			2
" could that be where the term bullpen derived ? @entity85 chewing tobacco ? the story sounds like good old - fashioned folklore			1
" this is a story i 've lived with , " says @entity53			0
" you hear stories in your family so much they become true			2
" @entity20 ' father left home during the @entity95 and became a minor league player by 16			1
during @entity97 , @entity20 ' father was playing for the @entity98 in aa baseball			1
then he was drafted by the @entity100			0
after the war , he signed up for the @entity102 , which periodically interrupted his 13 - year baseball career			2
@entity20 ' father had combat infantry badges from @entity97 , @entity105 and @entity106			1
he did n't chew tobacco			2
" when he came back from @entity106 , he quit , " @entity20 said			1
" he never smoked or drank again			0
" @entity20 ' grandparents raised him warning him that the men in the family had problems with alcohol			1
" i was afraid to start drinking			0
i did n't want to become an alcoholic			0
i had a great desire to excel			0
i did n't have my first drink until i was 30			0
" and so , @entity20 , without chewing , without smoking , without drinking , played the minors and dreamed of the majors			1
after playing for 10 years , he realized , the @entity32 were never going to call him up from the farm league			0
they told him , ' we do n't want you to be a major league player			0
we want you to be a major league coach			0
' that meant coaching for a long time in the minors			0
so he honed his skills in the minors , developing young talent the way he wishes he 'd been developed , learning from the mistakes that the men who should have been his mentors made			0
" i was 30 - something			0
i had n't made it to the majors			0
a minor league manager for @entity32 was a lonely job			0
you did n't have a staff of coaches			0
by then , i thought i could handle anything			0
so i started having a few beers to relax after the game			0
" before he got too deep into drinking , @entity20 made a call for a new job , a new route to the majors			1
the @entity21 answered the call			0
@entity20 became the team 's third - base coach			1
but his ascent hit a very big roadblock			0
the one his family warned about			0
in 1988 , upper management realized he had a problem with alcohol			0
he was determined not to be derailed			0
" i found myself in a rehab center in @entity164 , just in the nick of time , " @entity20 said			1
" i 'd spent a lot of time trying to get to the top of this game , so i was gon na get help			0
it 's not like it 's going to go away			2
but i 'll always be an alcoholic			0
" @entity20 made it back to sobriety			1
and he made it back to the majors			0
he 's been coaching with the @entity21 for the past 37 years , with over half a century working in baseball			1
a number of years were as a pitching coach , in the bullpen , where his father had spent so much time as a catcher			2
even before @entity2 announced this week that there would be no more tobacco chewing within sight of the fans , teams would bring in well - known players such as @entity189 , a former @entity190 outfielder , to tell players about his tobacco chewing days and the throat cancer he battled			1
the league was committed to advising players on the dangers of smoking and drinking			0
@entity20 has continued to follow in the tradition of his father			1
like his father , @entity20 writes books			1
his latest is " @entity201			0
" like his father , he did n't chew tobacco			1
like his father , he quit drinking and is proud to say he has n't had a drink in 25 years			2
unlike his father , @entity20 made it to the majors and remains with the @entity21			1
at 71 , @entity20 still goes to spring training and coaches all the home games			1
" i help coaches if they have questions -- if i can help them -- through my experience			0
" @entity20 dreamed of the majors			1
he kept dreaming , until he got there .			0
