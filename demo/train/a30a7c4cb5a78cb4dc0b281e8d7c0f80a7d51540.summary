-- a flowering @entity2 shrub thought to be extinct in the wild for almost seven decades was added to the federal endangered species list wednesday after a sharp - eyed biologist spotted the plant on a highway median while driving off the @entity8			1
the last known @entity12 manzanita ( @entity11 ) was discovered in 2009 during a highway construction project , and after genetic tests confirmed the species , the state spent $ 109,000 on a crane to move the plant and its 12.5 - ton root ball to another site so the $ 1 billion project could continue , federal and state officials said			1
the low - growing coastal shrub was relocated to another area in the @entity25 , a 1,491 - acre national park next to the @entity8 , federal officials said			1
the evergreen is estimated to be more than 50 years old and was growing a few feet from traffic along the @entity8 roadway , also designated as @entity31 @entity30 , which connects the bridge and @entity33 , officials said			2

the plant lay hidden under eucalyptus and other trees , officials said			2
when the trees were cleared , the manzanita became visible for the first time in decades and was spotted by biologist @entity43 , director of habitat restoration for @entity45 , who was driving home from speaking at a climate change conference , according to federal officials and the @entity50			1
@entity43 noticed the unusual plant while driving 40 mph in heavy traffic , and he confirmed his suspicions about the plant 's identity when he returned to the site a few days later , the institute said			0
the manzanita was last seen in the wild in 1947 when a botanist stood in front of earth - moving equipment and saved what was then believed to be the last known wild specimen from a construction site , the institute said			1
the botanist sent the plant to a botanical garden			0
the manzanita found in 2009 had grown to a healthy size : its roots stretched 20 feet wide and sank 18 inches into the soil , officials said			2
the plant 's bright green leaves are smooth , flat and wider toward the tips			0
the shrub likes open bedrock outcrops and reaches 3 feet in height , displaying pinkish flowers from january to april			0
it reproduces from seed after a fire or other disturbance , and the seeds are eaten and dispersed by raccoons , coyotes , foxes , deer , rodents , quail and turkey , the wildlife service said			0
the agency is now proposing about 318 acres of federal and state parkland in @entity33 and the surrounding county be designated as critical habitat for the shrub , said @entity100 spokeswoman @entity99			1
clues to saving @entity102 from extinction the plant is known only to exist on the @entity33 peninsula area and prefers serpentine soil , a low - nutrient area that allows it to out - compete non-native plants , officials said			1
" genetic diversity in plants is really important , as in animals as well , " @entity99 said			0
" when you lose a link in the chain , there are unknown consequences that you ca n't see			0
" this plant has been used to prevent erosion on our hillsides in the @entity33 area , so it is certainly of benefit to people as well as plants , " @entity99 added			1
the @entity50 said protecting the long - lost plant under the @entity128 closes " one of our coldest conservation cases			2
" the institute petitioned the federal government to put the plant -- " a subtly charming flowering shrub , " the group says -- on the endangered species list , the organization said			1
the @entity139 and the @entity140 co-petitioned for the protections , the institute said			0
invasive species : eat them before they eat everything			0

the @entity12 manzanita is a flowering shrub found only on @entity33 peninsula
it has been believed extinct since 1947
a highway construction project removes trees covering the plant ; passing biologist notices it
the plant and its 11 - ton root ball are relocated ; feds put shrub on endangered list
