-- @entity1 may become the hottest new vacation spot			1
@entity3 , the studio behind the " @entity5 " movies , announced in a conference call with analysts friday morning that the company had been approached about " @entity5 " theme parks in two territories , and was considering the possibility , according to @entity12			1
no further details were given			1
it obviously makes financial sense for the @entity17 empire to expand ; the first film made over $ 690 million , and people seem a little bit excited for " @entity21 , " opening november 22			1
' @entity22 ' : see full coverage ignoring the pesky fact that starving districts full of poor people looking toward revolution as a way to end their suffering is n't the most upbeat concept ( and blatantly misses the point of the books ) , let 's brainstorm some ideas about what @entity35 : @entity36 would look like , should it happen			1
it seems that the " @entity40 way " — with a couple different " settings " from the world all part of the park — might be a good model to follow			1
there could be a fictional forest to represent the outer districts , a fancier @entity49 area , and then some kind of arena to signify the @entity22			1
the most obvious activity is also the most necessary			1
in whatever forest - type layout the park designs , there should be archery lessons and targets for every wannabee @entity17			1
this is an actual skill that many never have the opportunity to try , and as opposed to some of the more fantastical ideas in the novels ( such as @entity67 ) , archery is totally feasible ; side - braids for all participants totally mandatory			2
' @entity5 : catching @entity71 ' clip shows @entity17 tearful and scared 3			2
the disturbing world of excess at the @entity49 is clearly more theme - park ready than @entity49			1
in the @entity49 section of the park , there should be makeovers aplenty , so everyone can get in touch with their inner @entity82			2
if the designers can figure out a way to replicate the " @entity87 " dress for photos , all the better			2
for a more chilling take on the @entity49 , have some kind of dark maze people must maneuver through while the voice of @entity93 yells at you to come out			2
haunted houses would have nothing on those kind of fears ! 4			2
while the first book 's arena is fairly basic , the one for the @entity99 in " @entity21 " provides more opportunities for some missing - the - point fun			0
set up like a giant clock , perhaps this could be the " game " aspect of the park			0
in groups , you enter the arena and must be the last person standing			0
every , say , 10 minutes some kind of bad thing happens — like rain or smoke machines — and you would lose a member of your team ( to an exit sign			0
we 're not monsters here ! )			0
instruct people to dive to a bottom of a pool or strap on a harness and climb a tree for various points , and you 've got a thrilling adventure that does n't end with everyone 's deaths			0
refreshments are another area where staying true to the source material might make tourists unhappy			0
perhaps instead of starving residents , people could have a tribute - worthy feast aboard a @entity49 train that gives fans a scenic tour of the park			0
@entity49 screens broadcasting mandatory viewing of kids killing kids clearly not included			0
