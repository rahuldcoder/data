@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- @entity19 is like the " q " of the gardening world			1
since most cities do n't look kindly on those seeking to alter the cityscape without permission , @entity19 has integrated a gardening kit into the everyday objects of the urban professional to disguise clandestine gardening activities			1
