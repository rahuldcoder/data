-- not many winners of the @entity3 @entity2 thank ghosts and spirits in their acceptance speech			1
but for @entity8 , @entity10 's first ever winner of the film award , it was a natural thing to do			1
" it was kind of an in - joke			0
at the same time , i think [ " @entity21 " ] is about [ a person ] who believes in spirits , in reincarnation so i kind of thank him for it because he might have been there , " he told @entity0			0
the award came as a shock to @entity8 , who has previously found success at @entity3 when he won the @entity25 in 2004 for " @entity26 , " but did n't expect to win the big prize			1
" when i heard @entity28 will be head of jury , i was thinking no way ... but when i actually won the prize i thought a different way that maybe because @entity28 has always created his own wacky world and also my film operates in my own world , and it 's quite a nutty one			0
" the " nutty world " of " @entity21 " has a lead character ( played by a real - life roof welder ) who talks to spirits and ghosts as he faces the last days of this life			1
@entity8 believes the success of the film at the festival and with international audiences where it has been shown is down to the universal theme of fear of loss			1
" another point is if the trend of movie culture is to be so bombarded by such high production movies , people crave for a personal movie now , a small one , " he said			0
while some critics debated if " @entity21 " was a worth winner of such an esteemed award , others praised @entity8 for creating a film more like a metaphysical meditation ; @entity28 described it as " like a beautiful dream that you do n't see very often			2
" @entity8 however has been battling with the harsh realities of making what many consider art - house film in @entity10 for many years			1
the " @entity21 " project took three years to complete and many of his other films have faced heavy censorship			0
his 2006 film " syndromes and @entity75 " was accused by the @entity10 authorities as being a potential threat to national security , something @entity8 refuted			1
" you can not make anything , i mean , you can not [ talk ] basically about politics , and also religion , and other institutions in @entity10			2
you can not talk about that in cinema			0
so that kind of cripples you in a way			0
" he won a few battles against the film censors and helped to establish a rating system for films in @entity10 , but @entity8 still believes the need to speak out against limits to freedom of speech			1
@entity8 was not surprised to see the protests and violence that gripped @entity10 's capital earlier this year			1
" i guess [ the violence ] is bound to happen because we had such a huge gap in the difference in the classes of people			0
[ it ] also makes us think about where we stand especially if you 're @entity10 ; it forces us to think about our moral standpoint			2
" i think we all should speak more			0
because @entity10 has become a democracy not long ago			2
and people still , we are still in obedience ? it is a very obedience culture			0
