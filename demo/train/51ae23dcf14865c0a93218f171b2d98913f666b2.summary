@entity0 , @entity1 -- the center of @entity0 could n't be more decked out for the holidays			1
it seems like there are ribbons and wreaths for every lamppost and door			1
lights sparkle from trees , and a big wood sign calls residents to the local firehouse to pick up even more holiday sprigs			1
that same firehouse is where parents ran in panic after receiving robocalls and texts about a shooting friday at @entity24 up the street			1
now , the high spirits of the holidays have been darkened			1
signs in storefronts have stopped declaring holiday cheer and are calling instead for prayer and mourning			1
the firehouse is ringed by first responders greeting members of the community coming to drop flowers and notes			1
a sign pointing to the entrance of the local grade school now marks the scene of a massacre of young children			1
a day that started like any other since the shooting , tears fall easily in this town , especially after police released the sober list of names of the dead			1
it was striking as much for the birth dates as for the length			1
the column " @entity58 " listed 20 born in the years 2005 and 2006			1
then six names of female educators young and middle - aged			1
the 7th birthday of a little girl named @entity24 happened last week			1
another named @entity64 would have turned 7 in february			1
remembering the victims " i do n't think there are words , " said a woman as she broke down in tears when she came to leave flowers for the dead			1
her daughter also went to the elementary school			1
she had listened to the robocall about the shooter , feeling anything but calm			1
like a lot of mothers in the area , she had been swept by panic wondering which school had an unfolding crime and whether her child might be among those injured or killed			2
another woman , @entity86 , fell to the grass and wept when she saw the flowers around the elementary school sign post			2
she clutched her third - grader , recounting her later relief as she discovered her child was not among the victims			2
" but those other mamas , " she said in @entity93 , " how did they go forward ? " it was as if an entire town suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder			2
no one was left unmarked since those harrowing minutes friday of sorting out who had and had not survived , and the many hours since of figuring out how close danger had touched their lives			2
was their child ok ? what about their neighbor 's child or the teacher who once taught their teen ? @entity113 and husband @entity114 have a first and third - grader at the school			2
they rushed to @entity24 to see if their children were among the injured or dead			2
" when we got our children and i saw my son 's teacher , they were like ghosts , but they were incredibly composed ; they were calm ; they had their sheets with them checking off , making sure each child went with their parent , " she said			2
" they did everything possible to keep our kids safe , and i wish i had known when i looked at their faces just to say thank you because i have my children			2
" teacher : ' i wanted to be the last thing they heard , not the gunfire ' as mourners placed flowers for the dead , their friends could barely put together words			2
@entity146 walked with his head dipped as he thought of a friend who lost a son			0
" last night we felt something unusual because they did n't respond on the phone calls , messages , " he said of his friend			1
" last night they basically called us and ( there were ) just a few words			0
( their son is ) not with us anymore			0
" this family had come from @entity162 two years ago but quickly fit into a tightly knit community			0
@entity146 said he began considering them close friends almost overnight			0
" we can not comprehend with our minds and our hearts , " he said			0
some parents ' voices still rattled as they uttered that awful word " lockdown , " something children practice with their teachers			1
it is a modern addition to a fall season of fire drills and other safety lessons for the littlest of schoolchildren			0
but the word shocked adults when it took on real - life meaning			0
library clerk @entity183 fell into the arms of her husband as she recounted hearing crackling over the school 's public address system			0
" i thought they 'd left it on so i just called the office to tell them we could hear them , " she said			0
a member of the office staff told her about the shooter so she and some other staff hustled the kids into a storage closet			0
" we practice these lockdowns ; we have to have several by a certain date , " she said			0
she handed out pieces of paper and crayons to the cluster of 6 - year - olds to keep them quiet			0
latest developments @entity208 said the door was kept locked while the principal and other staff were in the halls fighting off an attack			0
they were so scared of what was unfolding that they did n't even open the door for police when they finally came knocking			0
" i made him show his badge , " she said			0
the town 's initial trauma has turned to mourning as churches opened their doors for counseling and services , and a vigil for one teacher drew hundreds			1
on sunday , there were even more services as well as a planned visit by president @entity234 , all as the investigation unfolds into how a day that began with promises of some first - graders building gingerbread houses after school had ended this way			0
one woman who came with flowers said she was there because she did n't know what else to do			0
her friend could only offer this response : " i think it 's coming to these memorials , i think it 's being close from one family to another			0
you know just hugs ; i do n't think there are any words			0
" how you can help			0

signs of holiday cheer *replaced* with calls for prayer and mourning
initial trauma turns to grief as @entity0 families come together
parents begin to face the new reality in @entity0 , @entity1
