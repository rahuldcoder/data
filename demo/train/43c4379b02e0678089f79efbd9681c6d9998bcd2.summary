fbi director @entity2 says he worries the @entity4 attack could be replicated in the @entity13			1
in a speech to the @entity16 , @entity2 worried that the dramatic terror attack on hotels and other facilities in @entity4 potentially could be replicated in the @entity13			1
" this type of attack reminds us that terrorists with large agendas and little money can use rudimentary weapons to maximize their impact			2
and it again raises the question of whether a similar attack could happen in @entity31 or @entity32 , @entity33 , or @entity34 , " @entity2 said			1
he said he is increasingly concerned with " pockets of people around the world that identify with @entity39 and its ideology " but who have little or no actual contact with @entity39			0

" the prospect of young men , indoctrinated and radicalized within their own communities and induced to travel to @entity6 to take up arms -- and to kill themselves and perhaps many others -- is a perversion of the immigrant story			0
