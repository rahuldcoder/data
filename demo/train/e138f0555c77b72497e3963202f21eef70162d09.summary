@entity0 -- the showdown over who will bear the brunt of deep cuts to government spending has become a game of political poker with the nation 's troops caught in the middle , political experts and members of the military say			1
as he prepares to leave office , defense secretary @entity16 sounded a dire warning about the need to limit military pay to a 1 % increase in 2014 , effectively decreasing troop salaries next year , if the automatic cuts , called sequester , go into effect , an agency official told @entity1			1
first on @entity1 : @entity16 to recommend pay cut for military " this shadow , the shadow of sequestration , this legislative madness that was designed to be so bad , so bad , that no one in their right mind would let it happen , " @entity16 said in a speech at @entity28 on wednesday			1
" for those of you who have ever seen ( the movie ) ' @entity41 , ' it is the scene of the sheriff putting the gun to his head in order to establish law and order			2
" @entity16 warns of degraded military readiness from spending cuts the @entity53 has calculated that the @entity55 's @entity54 is expected to be above 1 % , but wants to still reduce pay because of " budget uncertainties , " a government official told @entity1			1
in 2013 , a 1.7 % increase was approved , based on the index , which has been the basis for military pay for the past several years			1
@entity16 is stepping up rhetoric about the impact of sequestration on the @entity53 if @entity64 does not agree to a plan in coming weeks to avert it			1
sequestration would cut across the government , but would hit the @entity53 especially hard			1
the military would face roughly $ 500 million in spending cuts over 10 years on top of a similar amount already in the pipeline			1
president @entity74 previously walled off the military from a reduction in pay so if this current compensation plan goes into effect , it 's widely seen as " cutting our pay , " one military officer familiar with the plan told @entity1			1
" it 's a smart move , it puts it in @entity64 ' hands			2
" @entity1 explains : sequestration @entity16 's comments followed @entity74 's call on tuesday for a short - term agreement to avert sequestration , which was created by @entity64 in 2011 to be so draconian that lawmakers would strike a budget deal and avoid the cuts			1
but now , the deadline for action is coming up next month and there 's no deal in sight			0
@entity74 calls for short - term fix to imminent spending cuts top republicans on the @entity104 and @entity105 committees released their own approach for temporarily staving off the brunt of those cuts by cutting some federal jobs through attrition			1
" @entity112 's military has absorbed $ 487 billion in defense cuts under president @entity74 , with $ 500 billion yet to come with sequestration			1
refusing to consider reforms to the mandatory spending that is driving our debt crisis , while using our troops as a piggy bank to keep unsustainable spending programs on life support , will have both fiscal and strategic consequences , " rep. @entity116 , @entity117 , chairman of the @entity119 , and sen. @entity120 , @entity121 , the ranking member of the @entity123 , wrote in a statement			2
all of this amounts to some pretty high stakes poker , political experts say			0
" scare talk about the effects of spending cuts is common in these circumstances			1
mostly , it 's a parade of imaginary horribles			0
although this time , the magnitude of the cuts , especially in defense , gives greater force to the dire predictions , " said @entity144 , a @entity145 political science professor			2
still , the specter of potential cuts worries those on the front lines and their families			2
" i feel like when things get tough and the economy goes and they look at cuts they immediately take benefits or pay or housing allowances , " said @entity156 , author of " your soldier , your army : a parent 's guide " , the wife of retired @entity159 gen. @entity170 and the mother of two members of the military			1
" these are the kids who are deploying			0
regardless of how people who feel about the war , this is a group of people who need to be compensated for what they do not taken away from , " she said			0
commenters on the story on @entity1 who identified themselves as members of the military were similarly frustrated			2
" i am disgusted by this , " wrote one commenter who identified as @entity188			0
" i am in the @entity112 military and currently deployed			2
i get to see and hear what happens to the rest of my military brothers and sisters putting their lives on the line for a country			2
it is an ugly reality			0
and what are they getting blown up for ? why do we spend days , months , and even years away from our families for ? for a country whose leaders do n't believe we are worthy enough to get a decent raise to take care of the families that have to deal with the consequences of our jobs			0
we are cutting budget everywhere else , why ca n't they cut their own salary ? where are the priorities of these people ? ? " a commenter who identified himself as @entity218 wrote that lots of @entity112 are n't getting pay raises in the current economy			0
" a 1 % pay raise is more of a raise than many @entity112 have received the last few years combined			0
welcome to the new economy ! " he wrote			0
" and do n't give me this ' hero ' bs , as many in the military only joined because they could n't find jobs here			0
in the military they preach of being part of a team , well enjoy teaming with the civilians who also face hardships in getting paid			0
" hyperbole is all part of an effort to get the other side to blink first , @entity144 said			0
" the number of workers likely to be laid off as a result of the sequester is basically imaginary although there will almost certainly be a slight surge in unemployment , " @entity144 said			0
" i really do n't think that the @entity53 will cut troop salaries which would hinder recruitment and retention			2
it 's much more likely that weapons systems will take the hit			0
" it 's not the first time both the administration and congressional republicans have tried to call each other 's bluff over the spending cuts			1
last year , president @entity74 told thousands of veterans at the @entity262 of the @entity266 ' " stop playing politics with our military			1
' " by the numbers : recent defense spending @entity1 's @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity271 and @entity272 contributed to this report .			0
