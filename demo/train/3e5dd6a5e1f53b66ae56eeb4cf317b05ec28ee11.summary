-- it 's taken over two decades for @entity3 's classic sci - fi novel " @entity4 " to make it to the big screen , but all the built - up anticipation did n't lead to out - of - this - world box office numbers			1
the film adaptation debuted with $ 28 million from 3,407 theaters on its first weekend â € ” a start in the same range as @entity15 's misfire " after @entity16 , " which opened with $ 27.5 million earlier this year			1
@entity17 and @entity18 spent $ 110 million on the space adventure starring @entity20 and @entity21 , but " @entity4 " will need great legs domestically and strong returns overseas to justify its cost ( and any potential sequels )			1
movie review : ' @entity4 ' of course , the film did n't bomb the way other ya - adaptations like " @entity30 , " " @entity31 " or " the @entity32 : @entity39 " have recently , but its opening was nowhere near the debuts of " @entity36 " or " @entity37 , " both of which had less expensive first editions than " @entity4			1
" notably , both of those films targeted young women primarily , while " @entity4 's " audience was 58 percent male and 54 percent above the age of 25			1
crowds issued the film an average " b + " cinemascore grade			0
" jackass presents : @entity50 " held up very nicely in second place , dropping just 36 percent to $ 20.5 million			1
that is by far the smallest second - weekend drop for any of the " @entity48 " films , and it gives @entity56 's $ 15 million prank comedy a $ 62.1 million total after ten days			1
if " @entity50 " continues to maintain great holds at the box office , it could exceed $ 100 million total			1
take that , @entity63 season ! third place belonged to @entity66 ' " @entity65 , " which opened with $ 16.5 million in 3,065 theaters			2
the film , which stars @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 , opened ahead of last year 's " @entity72 , " another film targeting the oft - ignored 45 + demographic , which started with $ 14.7 million on the way to $ 63.5 million total			1
movie review : ' @entity65 ' thanks to strong word - of - mouth and an " a- " @entity80 grade , older audiences may flock to the theater gradually over the next few weeks and push " vegas ' " total as high as $ 60 million			2
for a humble $ 28 million comedy , that 's a lot like hitting the jackpot			1
" @entity94 " started in fourth place with $ 16.2 million , and though the film was n't a total turkey , its box office left a lot to be desired			1
relativity 's $ 55 million animated entry , which features the voice of @entity98 , opened in an ultra-wide 3,736 theaters with virtually no family competition ( " @entity101 " arrived six weeks ago ) , but it could only muster a $ 4,336 per theater average			2
on the bright side , " @entity94 " did spike 82 percent from friday to saturday , which suggests that it is playing well with young tots during matinee shows , and it should hold up well as @entity109 approaches â € ” especially with an " a- " @entity80			0
it may earn back its budget yet			0
movie review : ' @entity94 ' rounding out the @entity113 was " gravity , " which pulled in another $ 13.1 million in its fifth weekend			2
@entity117 ' $ 100 million space drama starring @entity118 and @entity119 has now earned $ 219.1 million total and , with a little awards attention , should ultimately hit about $ 250 million domestically			2
" @entity4 " -- $ 28 million 2			1
" jackass presents : @entity50 " -- $ 20.5 million 3			1
" @entity65 " -- $ 16.5 million 4			2
" @entity94 " -- $ 16.2 million 5			0
" gravity " -- $ 13.1 million outside the @entity124 5 , " @entity125 " continued its successful expansion this weekend			0
the @entity63 contender jumped from 123 theaters into 410 locations and pulled in $ 4.6 million as a result			0
that gave the film an excellent $ 11,220 venue average , thus assuring it will continue to expand into more markets in the near future			0
@entity136 could have a sleeper hit on their hands			0
on the international front , " thor : @entity142 " hammered up a great debut this weekend			0
the film pulled in $ 109.4 million from 36 territories , which represents about 70 percent of the international market			0
the film performed best in the @entity147 ( $ 13.4 million ) , @entity148 ( $ 9.4 million ) , and @entity149 ( $ 8.2 million ) , and it still has openings in @entity151 and @entity152 to look forward to			0
the original " @entity139 " grossed $ 268.3 million internationally in 2011 , but after a major exposure - boost from " @entity154 , " " @entity142 " seems poised to easily outdo that film 's overall performance			2
it opens in the @entity157 on friday			0
