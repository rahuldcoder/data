therapy aimed at turning gay kids straight will soon be illegal in @entity2 , with the state 's governor declaring he hopes a new law will relegate such efforts " to the dustbin of quackery			1
" the legislation -- which the state @entity10 passed in may , gov. @entity12 signed into law this weekend and will take effect january 1 -- prohibits attempts to change the sexual orientation of patients under age 18			1
" this bill bans non-scientific ' therapies ' that have driven young people to depression and suicide , " @entity12 tweeted			2
" these practices have no basis in science or medicine			0
" but practitioners of so - called " reparative therapy " say the assertions of the governor and gay rights advocates " just are not true , " according to @entity30 , a spokesman for the @entity31			1
joined by " individual therapists and individual minor clients , " his group will file a " major lawsuit " this week to challenge the law , " @entity30 said			1
the @entity41 separately told @entity42 it will file its own lawsuit monday , alleging the law violates the @entity45			2
" we do competent therapy , therapy that truly works , " pickup , who himself underwent such therapy and now administers it to others , said monday on @entity42			2
" for them to have a bill that says , ' no , we ca n't even talk about these issues , we ca n't do anything to help these children resolve their homosexual feelings and maximize their heterosexual potential ' -- that 's the height of political and therapeutic irresponsibility			1
" @entity30 alluded to a report by the @entity61 that , he says , does n't find any " proof that ( the therapy ) causes harm			2
" but the psychiatric organization -- which is the world 's largest of its kind , with more than 36,000 members -- determined , in fact , that reparative therapy poses a great risk , including increasing the likelihood or severity of depression , anxiety and self - destructive behavior for those undergoing therapy			1
therapists ' alignment with societal prejudices against homosexuality may reinforce self - hatred already felt by patients , the association says			2
@entity42 blogs : gay in @entity88 " the longstanding consensus of the behavioral and social sciences and the health and mental health professions is that homosexuality per se is a normal and positive variation of human sexual orientation , " the association says			1
after the bill passed the state @entity10 , @entity99 spokeswoman @entity98 praised the " right first step in making sure that young people are protected from these unscrupulous therapists who are really engaging in therapeutic deception that is based on junk science			0
" " this law will ensure that state - licensed therapists can no longer abuse their power to harm @entity118 youth and propagate the dangerous and deadly lie that sexual orientation is an illness or disorder that can be ' cured , ' " said @entity108 's organization , which describes itself as the largest statewide advocacy group in @entity2 working for " full equality " for lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender people			1
@entity123 , who once participated in reparative therapy , said the bill protects youths from " a very , very dangerous therapy that does n't work and leaves a lot of people feeling despair and hopelessness			1
" yet @entity30 insists that the " children who walk into my office ... crying , depressed , lonely , gender - identity confused and sexually confused " ask for help voluntarily , because they are " distressed			1
" thousands believe , he claims , " believe there 's a cause - and - effect nature of homosexuality " that can be brought about by instances of abuse and issues like " gender identity inferiority , " " un-met needs from ... usually the same - sex parent " and other " inner wounds that we discover in therapy			1
" " when those wounds get healed , the homosexual feelings -- we do n't force them away , they naturally , spontaneously dissipate , " said @entity30 , who credits the therapy with having " helped save my life , " by decreasing his depression and raising his self - esteem			1
the debate could now move to court , thanks to promised lawsuits by @entity30 's group and the @entity41 that describes itself as a network of more than 1,000 attorneys " defending religious , parental , and other constitutional rights			1
" " of all the freedom - killing bills we have seen in our legislature the last several years , this is among the worst , " said @entity165 , the institute 's president and founder , in a written statement			2

in the therapy , he was consistently told his sexuality was a choice and could " be fixed , " he said			2
" i never believed that			0
i know i 'm gay just like i know i 'm short and i 'm half @entity193			0
i 've never thought that those facts would change			2
it 's part of my core fundamental identity			0
so the parallel would be sending me to tall camp and saying , ' if you try very hard , one day you can be 6 - foot - 1			2
' " @entity183 said psychologist @entity200 treated him			0
his parents provided @entity42 with copies of bills from @entity200 's office , but @entity200 said he did not remember treating someone by that name			0
he told @entity42 he views the therapy he provides as " trying to bring out the heterosexuality " in someone			1
yet @entity200 insisted the therapy is not harmful , and he treats only people who want to change			1
a leading psychologist in the field of reparative therapy , @entity215 , treated a boy named @entity217 , whose story was told in a 2011 @entity42 report			1
@entity215 considered @entity217 a success story , writing that " his feminine behavior was gone " -- proof , @entity215 said , that homosexuality can be prevented			0
but @entity217 's family said he never stopped being gay			0
he hanged himself at the age of 38			0
despite allegations by the family that @entity215 ' therapy decades earlier ultimately led to the suicide , @entity215 told @entity42 that scientifically , it " would be inaccurate to assume that it was the therapy , " and that he grieves for the parents			0
" two independent psychologists with me had evaluated him and said he was better adjusted after treatment , " @entity215 said			0
" i only meant to help , do the best i could with the parents , " he added			0
@entity215 ' days as a prominent anti-gay champion came to an end after he hired a male escort to accompany him on a trip to @entity241			0
he denied any sexual contact or awareness at the time that the escort offered sexual favors			0
earlier this year , psychiatrist @entity247 apologized for his 2003 study of reparative therapy , which suggested that it could help gays and lesbians become straight			1
he said it was deeply flawed			0
" i believe i owe the gay community an apology for my study making unproven claims of the efficacy of reparative therapy , " @entity247 said in a letter to the editor of the @entity255			1
" i also apologize to any gay person who wasted time and energy undergoing some form of reparative therapy because they believed that i had proven that reparative therapy works with some ' highly motivated ' individuals			2
" @entity183 said the therapy he underwent " led me to periods of homelessness , to drug abuse , to spending a decade of my life wanting to kill myself			0
it led to so much pain and struggle			0
and i want them to know that what they do hurts people			0
it has no basis in fact			0
and they need to stop			0
