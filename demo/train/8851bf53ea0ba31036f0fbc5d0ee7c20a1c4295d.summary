-- @entity1 said friday that he felt he had no choice but cancel a gig at @entity4 , given public pressure and his own conviction that the way the aquatic entertainment giant operates is not acceptable			1
" i do n't agree with the way they treat their animals , " @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity9			1
" it was n't that hard a deal for me			0
" the country music legend 's comments come one day after @entity18 spokesman @entity17 said @entity1 would not be part of next year bands , @entity21 & bbq events " due to scheduling conflicts			0
" but the 80 - year - old crooner did n't mention scheduling having played any part in his rationale			0
rather he nixed the show because he does not agree with @entity4 's treatment of its orca , or killer , whales and other sea creatures -- a sentiment that has spread among those who have seen " @entity37 " documentary that aired on @entity0 on the topic			1
the @entity40 rock band @entity39 also pulled the plug on their show at the @entity44 theme park for similar reasons , a decision made two days after drummer @entity46 tweeted the group was " looking at options " after seeing " @entity37 " and after an online petition urged them to do so			1
@entity4 responds to questions about captive orcas , ' @entity37 ' film @entity1 pointed to similar efforts asking him to follow suit			1
the most meaningful , even if it had just a few hundred signatures , may have come from one of @entity1 's grandchildren , with " people she knew asking me not to play this venue			2
" another petition had 9,000 names attached to it on @entity66 , with author @entity67 writing that @entity1 's " activism for animals , the environment and other good causes " made it imperative that he cancel his show , in light of the documentary			1
when his decision became public , @entity67 declared " victory " and said she hoped his and the @entity39 ' decisions " will inspire other artists to stay away from performing at @entity4 because at least they 've got the choice -- unlike the animals trapped there			2
" such public pressure was n't insignificant , but @entity1 said he acted because he felt it was the right thing to do			0
many zoos can be considered " cruel " for how they hold animals , the singer said , adding that he would n't blame a captive monkey " for wanting to throw stuff at you			0
" " i understand that there are some natural - habitat zoos out there , which is probably ok , " @entity1 added			0
" but what they do at @entity4 is not ok			0
" @entity4 challenges ban limiting interaction between whale and trainer @entity0 's @entity102 contributed to this report .			2

@entity1 says " it was n't that hard " a decision to cancel his @entity4 gig
" i do n't agree with the way they treat their animals , " he says
@entity1 's cancellation comes a week after the @entity39 canceled
the theme park has faced *criticism* in the wake of the @entity0 doc , " @entity37 "
