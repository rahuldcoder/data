-- the animal kingdom is full of big beasts , but it 's the graceful nature of the horse which speaks loudest on the artist 's canvas			1
from the dawn of time , the horse has evoked passion and wonder amongst humans since its image was scrawled against the walls of caves			1
it has inspired novels , starred in films and has become the darling of the art world with collectors spending millions of dollars every year			1
grace " personally , i can not think of any animal more artistically stimulating than the horse , its grace , power and speed , are all begging to be captured in pencil , paint or clay , " @entity22 chairwoman @entity21 told @entity0			1
" the horse is strong , yet fragile ; it has the potential for danger , whilst capable of being incredibly gentle			1
" you can echo it 's elegance through the fashions of @entity35 or surrounding the polo field			0
it can be found in the wildest locations , from the vast expanses of the @entity41 plains ( @entity42 ) to the shady woodland of @entity45 's @entity44			0
" i have been drawing horses since i could hold a pencil , and will do so until the day i die			1
more than any other animal , the horse is equally capable of taking the lead in your artwork , or as a supporting role			1
it 's the perfect muse			0
" @entity55 if @entity56 has been seduced , so too was the 18th century painter @entity55 , who captured the beauty of the horse in a way that transcended the work of other artists of his generation			1
initially fascinated by the anatomical structure of the animal , @entity55 built upon his early sketch work before moving onto painting large canvases such as his renowned ' @entity69 ' which was finished in 1762			1
the publication of his work , " @entity72 " in 1766 enabled him to capture the elegant nature of the animal with a skill that few others possessed			0
his work won him plenty of admirers and after settling in @entity79 in 1758 , @entity55 began to paint for the @entity45 aristocracy			1
in his book , " the @entity86 'd - an @entity85 in @entity87 , " @entity81 explains the development of @entity55 ' style			1
" his dedication to the skeletal and muscular anatomy of the horse certainly enabled @entity55 to produce much more life like portrayals of horses , especially with respect to their musculature than had been achieved even by the great masters of painting , " @entity88 wrote			1
" no one portrayed horses so accurately before			2
in this he was more true to nature , as he wished to be			0
" dollar signs modern collectors scramble to get their hands on anything painted by @entity55 and in july 2011 , his " @entity108 on @entity109 , with @entity110 , a @entity111 , and a jockey " sold for $ 35.9 million making it the third most valuable old master painting to be sold at auction by @entity116			1
@entity108 , one of the most famous and iconic racehorses of the 18th century , won 28 of his 36 races , coming home unplaced just once			0
the painting showed @entity108 twice -- in the foreground being rubbed down by a stable lad and also in the background where he was winning a " trial			2
" " when @entity55 came along he took it to another level as he had an anatomical interest in horses and drew the muscle structure , " @entity124 of @entity116 , the world 's leading art business , told @entity0			1
" in terms of looking at @entity135 , the painting of horses became more popular in @entity136 and the restoration of @entity135 monarchy and @entity139 building a palace in @entity109			1
" it followed the growth of interest in racing and was also tied in to the interest in hunting , particularly stag hunting in the 17th century and then fox hunting in the 18th century			0
" it became an allied art -- a recording of human interest for the sport			0
" cave time thousands of years before @entity55 was painting , the horse had been visualized in the @entity157 cave images which adorn the walls of the the @entity159 in south west @entity160			1
" it 's the most paintable subject in animal world , " renowned artist @entity161 told @entity0			2
" the horse is such a beautiful animal to and is an inspiration to all			2
" with a race horse , it has so many variations in form , in color and style			2
" @entity161 began his work as an illustrator before moving onto painting			2
as a young boy , he would accompany his father to race tracks across southern @entity45 and it was there that his love affair with horses began			2
since then , he has painted some of the most famous and iconic horses in history such as @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188 , while he was also recently commissioned to paint @entity189 during her visit to @entity191 in @entity192			2
classic " a classic painting can take anything from two to three weeks with @entity161 currently working on a painting of the @entity189 's @entity197 winner estimate			0
" it is the movement of the horse which interests me , " he added			0
" you paint every aspect in the way you can and you make it perfect			0
it 's difficult to do that with a photograph			0
" in a photo , you might get one part of it that looks great but another which is n't as good			0
with a painting , it 's possible to make it all perfect			0
" for some , such as @entity217 , the opportunity to capture the horse during the gallop at the racecourse is one of the most fascinating aspects of her work			0
. " a large , lush field full of thoroughbred mares and foals basking in the sunlight is heavenly to see , " she said			0
" to be there , with them , drawing , adds to the very special experience			0
yet there is nothing more exciting and challenging , than to be stood at the side of the gallops or at the race course , where the atmosphere is so diverse			0
" there is always something for the artist -- a shining horse being washed off , walking round the paddock , jockeys jumping on , spooky , skittish horses , exhausted horses and with the fit thoroughbred , so much of the anatomy is there to see			1

the horse has inspired paintings , novels and films
artists have been capturing the image of the horse for centuries
