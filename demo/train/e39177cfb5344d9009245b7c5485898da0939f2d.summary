@entity6 students celebrate receiving @entity8 textbooks			1
then they stare in wonder			2

others lift it up in triumph , singing and dancing in joy			0
the gift that inspires this kind of marvel in many @entity21 children is none other than a simple schoolbook			1
books are so rare in many @entity21 countries that children celebrate receiving them as if it were @entity4 morning , says @entity29 , a manager for @entity8 , a nonprofit group that ships donated books to @entity21 countries			1
@entity29 traveled last year to a remote @entity6 village , where he saw children who were studying in mud - brick schools with no electricity or running water eagerly grab a shipment of donated textbooks			0
" it was like my kid getting an @entity42 , '' says @entity29			0
" they protect them like gold			0
" is there a moral obligation to feed poor children 's minds as well as their bodies ? books for @entity53 's leaders think so			1
the group says it shipped 2.7 million books to 24 @entity21 countries last year to combat what it calls a " book famine			1
" about 33 percent of school - age children in @entity53 have never set foot in a classroom , according to a @entity63 study released this year			1
among those who have , it 's not uncommon for 10 students to share one textbook , @entity8 officials say			1
a book offers impoverished @entity21 students some hope of a better life for themselves and their country , says @entity74 , @entity8 's assistant director			1
" education is the great equalizer , " @entity74 says			0
" when people get access to information , they 're on more equal footing			0
" students study in the dirt many @entity21 children do n't even have access to a pencil , says @entity88 , who distributes textbooks for @entity8 in the @entity21 nation of @entity6			1
@entity88 says she has seen students study in the dirt			1
she once watched @entity6 elementary school students practice their lessons in the sand because pencils and paper are a luxury			1
yet the students are eager to learn , she says			1
many have never left their village or traveled in a car or even seen electrical appliances			0

there are no bookshops in the @entity21 nation and the only books available are printed on thin paper with weak binding			1
@entity88 is co-director for a nonprofit group called @entity121 , which uses construction , education and nutrition to help lift @entity6 out of poverty , she says			1
once , however , she was a kindergarten teacher in @entity126 who had a classroom crammed with toys , puzzles and learning centers			0
she first visited @entity6 in 2001 with a church group , " fell in love with it , " and decided she had to return			2
she was later laid off as a teacher due to budget cuts and decided to return to @entity6 as a full - time volunteer in 2005			0
now she 's seen even the most rudimentary educational tool bring joy to @entity6			0
she once saw an @entity140 pastor visiting a @entity6 village give a villager a simple gift			0
" he gave one mother a brand new shiny yellow pencil and she jumped up and down thanking him and then just as fast broke it into three parts -- one for each of her children , " @entity144 says			0
the low literacy rate in @entity53 is related to political instability as well as poverty , says @entity74			1

what types of books are needed shipping books to @entity53 is n't like packing together shipments of food or medical supplies , @entity8 officials say			1
it involves sensitivity to @entity53 's history			1
the scars of colonialism , where @entity179 nations used violence to occupy @entity21 nations and pillage their natural resources , shapes what types of books are sent to @entity53			1
during colonialism , a bitter joke among @entity53 was that missionaries gave them the @entity189 but took their land			1
the joke reflected a belief among some @entity53 that @entity179 nations used eurocentric books to manipulate and build self - hatred among @entity53			1
@entity8 officials , though , say they refuse to send books that celebrate the superiority of @entity179 ways			2
in fact , they only send books that @entity21 schools request			1
" i do n't like it when you go in and tell them what they need , " @entity74 says			0
" i like them to tell us what they need			0
" the books that @entity21 nations typically request can be seen in a cavernous warehouse operated by @entity8 in @entity213 , @entity214			1
at the warehouse , rock and @entity217 music booms over the speakers as volunteers sort through thousands of books and zoom through the floor in forklifts			2
most of the books @entity21 countries requested were books for elementary and secondary schools			1
textbooks -- geography , science and math -- are abundant			0
the books that are n't used are recycled into paper			2
@entity8 officials estimate they save about 2 million books a year from landfills			2

the group also depends on volunteers to sift through its books			1
one of them , @entity247 , a clerk at a media center in a suburban @entity213 elementary school , joined @entity8 after she read about it on a web site			0
some of her @entity140 students do n't know how lucky they are , @entity252 says			2
" our kids are spoiled			0
they come in our 10,000 - book media center and say , ' there 's nothing to read , ' " she says			0
@entity140 adults are spoiled as well , says @entity74			0
she says it 's easy for @entity140 to forget how much information they have at hand			0
" we 're standing in the grocery line and we 're bombarded by tabloids , and we 're bombarded by books and tv , " she says			2
" you 're not bombarded by anything there , " @entity74 says			0
" you pull out a box of books and people are so grateful and so happy			2
you feel like you 've given them so much			0
