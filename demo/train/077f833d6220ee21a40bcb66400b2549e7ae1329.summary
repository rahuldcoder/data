the @entity4 administration and its allies believe the @entity7 government may have used chlorine gas in a deadly attack this month on its own people , several @entity1 officials and other diplomats told @entity11			1
the alleged assault that killed at least two and affected dozens of others occurred in the village of @entity16 , a rebel - held area			1
while there is no firm proof as the matter is being looked into , several @entity1 officials and @entity19 diplomats say the @entity1 believes the regime of @entity24 is responsible because it has such chemicals and the means to deliver them			2
" our assessment is it is , at a minimum , concentrated chlorine dropped from helicopters , " a @entity1 official said			0
" that could only be the regime			0
" the official did not speak for full attribution			0
if true , such an attack would spotlight a deal brokered by @entity37 last fall and approved by the @entity38 that requires @entity7 to surrender its chemical weapons to the international community			1
the agreement quieted threats of military action by the @entity1 over allegations @entity7 launched a chemical attack last august outside @entity46 that killed more than 1,400 people			1
@entity48 and other officials vehemently denied their forces were responsible			0
the @entity7 opposition , which does not have helicopters to carry and deliver such weapons , and the regime have been trading accusations about the april 11 incident for more than a week			2
controversy followed video clips posted on anti-government websites showing a number of civilians , including children , appearing to have difficulty breathing and using oxygen masks			0
the chemical symbol for chlorine ( @entity67 ) is visible on the side of a canister that opposition activists say was used in the attack			2
" there are indications that these substances maybe have been used by the regime , but it has to be verified , " one @entity19 diplomat said			0
@entity79 spokeswoman @entity78 conveyed @entity19 suspicions on monday			0
she said the @entity1 " had indications of the use of a toxic industrial chemical , probably chlorine , in @entity7 this month , in the opposition - dominated village of @entity87			1
" " we 're examining allegations that the government was responsible , " @entity78 said			0
chlorine is not listed as a chemical @entity7 is expected to give up under the @entity38 resolution			1
but its use as a weapon of war is prohibited under the @entity98 , of which @entity7 is a signatory			1
" you do n't have to use sarin and mustard to terrorize a population , " another official said of deadly chemical gases			0
" and you do n't have to kill a lot of people to terrorize the population			0
" @entity1 officials and @entity19 and @entity112 diplomats point to several incidents over the last month suggesting the use of toxic gases , seen as particularly effective in sowing panic and fear in rebel - held areas			1
officials say there now is a debate within the administration about how to respond			2
the matter is likely to be referred for investigation to the @entity126 , the global body charged with eliminating @entity7 's stockpiles			2
the latest revelation poses a new dilemma for the administration on @entity7 , where civil war continues to rage			1
while chlorine is not as poisonous as chemicals like mustard gas or sarin , it would violate of @entity7 's international obligations			1
while some of the administration feel a strong response is needed , officials said others are concerned a robust response would complicate ongoing cooperation with @entity7 on its more dangerous stockpiles			1
" there is not a consensus , " another @entity1 official said			0
" some would like to be stronger and some are more cautious			0
it ca n't go answered but if we equate it to a chemical attack then the question becomes what are we going to do about it ? and i do n't think we have figured that out yet			0
" sen. @entity159 , who has been sharply critical of the administration 's @entity7 policy , said in a statement the latest allegations are troubling			2
" it is essential that the @entity4 administration work with the international community to fully and immediately investigate these reports			1
if substantiated , it is clear that such attacks violate the spirit of the @entity1 agreement with @entity37 for the destruction of @entity7 's chemical weapons and the @entity24 regime must finally be held accountable for it actions , " the @entity169 @entity168 said .			2

new allegations *surface* that @entity7 used toxic chemical against rebel - held area
if true , the issue spotlights deal @entity7 made to get *rid* of its stockpiles
@entity4 administration officials are debating how to respond
