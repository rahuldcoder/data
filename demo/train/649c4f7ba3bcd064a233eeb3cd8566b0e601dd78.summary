hello ! welcome to the @entity0			1
it 's a big place , so let me show you around			2
you 're approaching @entity4 , where residents routinely post too much information			1
the @entity7 and @entity8 are particularly nefarious time - sucks			2
up ahead is @entity10 , which is the worst			2
we recommend that you maintain an even keel and stay to the center ; the extreme left and right can be dangerous			2
and over there is the infamous lair of @entity19 , the home of trolls and loners who mercilessly mock everyone who enters their territory			2
watch your step : they may trip you up and you 'll fall into the @entity28			2
our world is n't all dangerous , of course			2
you may visit @entity30 , where images of cute cats and laughing babies fill the landscape			0
you 'll also meet countless kind strangers , hilarious raconteurs and hard - working fact - checkers			0
they make it all worthwhile			0
maybe it would be easier if you had a guide -- you know , some rules to help you find your way			1
what , you did n't know there are rules of the @entity0 ? of course there are rules			1
how do you think we maintain order around here ? a parody of rules that 's a joke			1
but there really are some rules of the @entity0 -- even if they , too , began as kind of a joke			1
according to the site @entity60 , the @entity58 began around 2006 as a guide for the @entity0 collective @entity62 and emerged on the old @entity63 , a bawdy meme catalog			1
soon a version emerged on 4chan , an online bulletin board where most users post anonymously , says @entity67 , director of web / digital media at @entity70 's school of communication			1
" @entity72 ( 4chan 's founder ) kind of designed it , kind of like a @entity79 rules , " he says , describing the unspoken code of conduct that lubricates @entity0 discourse			1
( @entity72 has attributed the rules to @entity81 , a role - playing community			1
) but the rules of the internet deliberately mocked many of those conventions			1
the self - reflexive parody fit perfectly with its community 's attitude , points out @entity89 , a professor at @entity91 's @entity90			0
" these jokes are meant to comment on something happening in the world , " he says			0
" later they get accepted as truisms or become a meme			0
" the absurdity has been reflected even in the supposed number of rules			1
though the best - known first version claimed there were 50 rules , only 18 were listed			1
number 1 was initially " do not talk about @entity58 2 - 33 " ; no rules 2 - 33 were on the list			1
the sarcastic attitude was reinforced by the kicker found on @entity63			0
it was a parody of @entity111 's stub language : " this article is crap			0
you can help by completely re-writing it			0
" ' @entity116 ' and @entity117 very quickly , the lists started multiplying and expanding , liberally borrowing from comedy , web culture and math - science tropes			1
on one list , a few were designated by complex numbers and mathematical symbols			0
some were observations ; others were directives			0
two rules were taken from " @entity116 " : " you do not talk about 4chan ( or " / b / , " 4chan 's random , free - wheeling bulletin board ) and " you do not talk about 4chan			1
" one version of @entity134 stated " there is no rule 6 , " which is from a @entity117 sketch			0
rule 42 , " always bring a towel , " was drawn from @entity140 ' " @entity142 " series			0
( if you have to ask , read the books			0
) " @entity146 , " @entity144 , came from " @entity145			0
" other rules went the reverse direction and became part of mainstream culture			1
rule 34 -- " if it exists , there is porn of it " -- is likely the most famous			0
but there 's also " pics or it did n't happen " ( @entity155 ) , " for every given male character , there is a female version of that character ; conversely for every given female character , there is a male version of that character " ( rule 63 ) and , of course , the corollary to rule 34 -- " if no porn of it exists at the moment , it will be made " ( rule 35 )			0
most retained a sense of humor , riffing off established rules and occasionally ending with a giggly " no exceptions			2
" but a handful were , and remain , as serious as a judge -- notably the three directly about @entity62 ( commonly rules 3 - 5 ) : - we are anonymous			1
- we do not forgive , we do not forget			0
the overall @entity0 rules may have started as a joke , but such ominous language from @entity62 speaks to some of the paradoxes of the @entity185 : rules ? why do we need some stinkin ' rules ? after all , rules can be helpful -- or divisive			1
they can create community -- or subvert it			0
even @entity62 , the activist group itself , cuts both ways , says @entity89			1
when it hacked the extremist @entity197 , many people cheered			0
but when it goes after less unpopular targets , some cry vigilantism			0
@entity67 says that the rules themselves try to have it both ways			2
they 're funny until someone gets hurt			2
they " play more of a game type of role			0
they can be bent or broken or cheated or moved around , as you would in any game that has no physical reaction , " he says			0
" that does n't take into account ever the result of real people being affected by this -- such as teenagers , children , anybody who 's seeing things that they should n't			0
" he adds , " there 's a lot of rules in there that work for ( the creators ) more than anyone else			2
until they become victims of their own thing , they do n't know how powerful the rules are			2
" evolving from the @entity237 of course , the @entity0 is n't that old , and we 're still in its @entity237 era in many ways			1
as the technology evolves from a handful of hackers on @entity247 bulletin boards to billions of users on officially sponsored sites , the customs -- the rules -- of the @entity185 will evolve with it			1
but we 're not talking about the kinds of changes that your family makes to the rules of @entity256 ( no , @entity257 is not for the pool of money acquired via @entity260 and @entity261 )			1
we 're talking something more expansive : all the established customs of our carbon - based life forms , making way for the instantaneous and virtual modes of silicon - based electronics			1
who knows what new rules may be written ? " when you 're in the midst of social change , it 's impossible to determine where it 's going , " says @entity271 , a former programmer who 's now a @entity272 - based attorney			1
" and i think we are in the greatest social change in the history of humans , because there are no boundaries of geography or time			0
" we have n't even sorted out what happens when the differences in local culture meet global technology			2
@entity289 , a philosophy professor at @entity290 in @entity291 who teaches a course on philosophy and technology , argues that not all parts of the world are as tolerant or open - minded as @entity298 democracies			0
" there are a lot of other places in the world that are actively using the technology of the @entity0 to control the free communication among citizens , and to identify critics of the government and hurt them , " he says			1
" we need to be mindful in what we advocate from our perspective that the tools that are implemented on the @entity310 are tools for the global net			0
" in other words , citizens of other countries already face actual , enforceable rules -- unlike the folkways established by @entity185 users in the @entity237			1
witness the frictions of the @entity319 , or the restrictions of societies such as @entity322			0
it 's the kind of perspective that provides a different context for the issues raised by a libertarian , anything - goes @entity0			1
it 's hard enough to stop " @entity330 " comment boards from devolving into flamebaiting , meme - generating files of @entity333			0
so for now , we 're still making our way through the @entity335 , and nobody knows where the boundaries lie			2
we joke , we grimace and we marvel at the creativity of the hive mind			2
the @entity0 is a big place , and countless cultures have set up residence			1
eventually , what is now humor may lose its zing ; what are now customs may become laws			0
will the rules ever become the rules ? maybe some future generation will figure out the true guideposts of @entity0 life , and the singularity will be upon us			1
what did we miss ? share your rules for the internet below in the comments			2
we 'll feature some of the best on @entity363 .			0

yes , there are some rules to the @entity0 , though , for now they 're mainly an inside joke
some rules based on pop culture , some have become @entity185 memes
other rules ominously quote @entity62
is there a need for rules on the vast and wild web ? depends on where you stand
