the week before @entity1 hit @entity2 in 2005 , @entity0 came back to her native city on a trip for work			1
she stayed behind to help her family recover and has been home ever since			0
there was something she felt she had to do			0
" when something you are so familiar with is threatened to be lost forever , you cling to what 's familiar , " said @entity0 , who moved back from @entity10			1
for @entity0 and her brother , that meant bringing back a century - old @entity2 practice of masking , or masquerading , which was nearly vanishing			1
that year , she founded the @entity2 @entity18 and incorporated into the dance company a cultural legacy series of dance performance that would revive tradition of the @entity23 -- with a modern twist			1
" we wanted to do something representing this tradition and what it meant and symbolize it in some form			2
" the @entity33 practice started about 1912 , when groups of women in @entity2 ' red light district poked fun at society 's stereotypes of women by marching in street parades dressed as dolls			1
it grew into a tradition centered on dance and paired with jazz bands of the popular music of the era			2
groups of women embraced the attitude of freedom and the pageantry of the @entity33 street parades , but their focus grew over the decades			1
they organized and began serving their community through groups called " social aid and pleasure clubs			2
" " these were just people who were very much of their community , " said @entity60 , a historian with the @entity61			2
" they tried to help their neighbors during an era of segregation and limited opportunity for all people of color			0
" however , by the 1980s and 1990s , only a handful of groups were masking as @entity23			2
several neighborhood groups like the @entity73 and the @entity74 were active in the new millennium			0
but by 2005 , the @entity33 practice seemed as if it was about to be forgotten in @entity1 's wake			1
" my brother and i decided , we needed a sort of campaign , " @entity0 remembered			1
" it all started so we could give something back in our own backyard			0
" she had heard about the @entity33 tradition as a child and felt that it was a medium close to her heart			1
" it 's synonymous with dance and with women , " she said			0
@entity0 's revival produced the @entity93 , with costumes , face paint , music and dances that are modern takes on the @entity23 of the past			1
rather than using a live band , her brother @entity99 plays mixes of hip - hop and jazz for their choreographed performances			0
but @entity0 also wanted to bring back the community focus central to the @entity33 tradition			1
by partnering with local schools and cultural organizations , the @entity93 connect with youth through education and outreach programs			1
" mainly , our focus as been creating creative movement - based workshops and motivational assemblies , " she said			0
led by the fully costumed @entity93 ensemble , the group takes students from the history of jazz to modern hip - hop			0
the kindergarten - 12th grade workshops bring a cultural history lesson to inner city youth , many of whom do n't know the history of @entity2 ' treasured music and cultural practices			2
" we just treat it like we 're in @entity131 , " @entity0 joked			2
" we just take it from scratch with them , introducing the culture , the significance of all that 's positive about the @entity140 - @entity139 tradition			1
" sine their debut at the @entity142 in 2009 and the @entity143 during @entity144 2010 , the @entity93 have grown from a dance ensemble to an organization of women inspired to do good in their community			0
" it evolved from a promiscuous background to neighborhood groups mimicking that behavior , " @entity0 said , " to now , women of excellence			2
" with a group of @entity157 , the group is has more than 40 members this year			0
from health professionals to bus drivers to charity organizers , each of the women inducted into the group uses her time and talents to further the @entity93 ' mission			0
for @entity0 and others , the legacy of the revival was in safeguarding the history of the tradition			1
" the first responsibility that we really felt was the need to preserve it , " she said			0
" i could n't think past the museum			0
" @entity0 helped curate the first @entity33 exhibit at the @entity178 with a group of historians and authors			1
working with @entity33 elders and the descendants of @entity23 , the exhibit shares their stories and traditions with artifacts in the museum			2
as their membership grows , the @entity93 hope their mission to reach their community through the practice will grow as well			1
this year includes plans for health and wellness seminars to go along with their education outreach			0
" it 's related to what these women did in the ' 30s and ' 40s , " @entity60 said			0
" they dressed as @entity23 for @entity144 day , but they were still a cohesive group the rest of the year			0

@entity33 masking practice started in @entity2 about 1912
in 2005 , @entity0 and her brother started a modern revival
@entity209 's mission is to preserve and pass on tradition through education , community service
they go into schools to teach a forgotten element of @entity2 culture
