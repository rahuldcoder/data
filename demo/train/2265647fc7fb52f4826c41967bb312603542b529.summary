-- a @entity2 minister who was defrocked this week for performing a same - sex wedding said friday he felt compelled to break church doctrine because it was an " act of love " for his son			1
when @entity8 's son was in his teens , he was suicidal , torn by sadness that the church would think less of him for being gay , @entity8 said friday on @entity0 's " @entity14			1
" when their son told his parents he was gay , the @entity15 recognized his pain and chose to embrace him			1
" my wife and i said , ' look , there 's nothing wrong with you			1
this is the way you were created , ' " @entity8 said on " @entity14			1
" " obviously , he did n't choose this because he prayed to @entity27 to make him , quote - unquote , ' normal			0
' and when that did n't happen , he really went through this crisis , " the minister explained			2
years later , in 2007 , @entity8 's son asked his father to perform his wedding			1
" for me , to say no to him ... it would have denied everything we ever told him in terms of affirmations and love that we gave him , " @entity8 said			1
the minister knew that performing the ceremony was going to stoke the ire of his superiors and that it was against church doctrine			1
so he was upfront with church officials			2
for six years , he did n't hear a word about the incident			0
then , apparently , someone in the church filed a complaint about him this year			2
on thursday , the minister at @entity56 of @entity57 in the small town of @entity59 was found guilty in a church trial for officiating his son 's same - sex wedding , church officials said			1
the verdict came after a jury of 13 clergy members determined in november that the minister had been disobedient to the discipline and order of the church			1
after that determination came a 30 - day suspension			0
the church asked @entity8 to decide whether his advocacy on behalf of the gay community would prevent him from fully complying with church law , according to a statement from bishop @entity75 of the @entity56			1
the church told him that he could retain his standing if he never performed another same - sex wedding again			1
@entity8 refused , telling the @entity78 that he could not uphold the church 's @entity79 in its entirety because it is discriminatory			1
that prompted the church to ask @entity8 to immediately surrender his credentials			1
he refused again , forcing church officials to defrock him			2
losing his job shook the minister			2
" actually , i was in shock , " he said on " @entity14			0
" " i did n't realize it right away , but my wife told me , when we were in the car , she said , ' look at your hand , ' and i looked at it			0
" " it really hit me harder than i thought , " he continued			0
" look , i mean , six , seven years ago , i was ready to give up my career for my son			2
i never thought this would ever come back after that long of a time , so i went on ministering			0
i 'm a pretty effective minister , so i never thought it would come to this			2
and especially not to the kind of attention that this has gotten nationwide			0
" the incident had received media attention across the globe			0
his son was recently interviewed , saying that he feels guilt for what has happened to his father , @entity8 said			1
" i always tell him , ' do n't feel guilty about this			0
this really had nothing to do with you			0
' this is based on the exclusionary policies of the church			2
that 's what causes this			2
we just have to stop the discrimination in the church			2
" the minister said that his views on homosexuality have evolved over the years			0
at one point , he believed that it was a sin			0
but when he went through seminary , he learned about " different interpretations " of scripture that addressed homosexuality			0
" by the time my son came out , i would describe myself as tolerant , " he said			0
but eventually , he became a " silent supporter " of his son , and once someone complained about the performance of his son 's wedding , he decided to be vocal and open about his feelings			1
his church is divided , he said , and he 's lost friendships			1
it has been a " painful process			0
" but he wants to remain in the @entity56 and work for change from within			0
he said he has already filed an appeal and hopes to become reinstated to the @entity148 clergy			0
@entity8 's case will be reviewed by the appeals committee of the @entity152 's northeast jurisdiction			1
it could also go to the judicial council , which is equivalent to the supreme court of the church , according to @entity8 's attorney , @entity157			1
the attorney expects the appeal to be heard in 2015			0
@entity0 's @entity160 contributed to this report .			0
