the lawsuit alleges that voters not authorized to vote in the primary runoff may have " diluted " the votes of legitimate @entity6 voters			1
it demands that state election officials open up the books and defer to federal law over state statutes in disclosing election records			0
the group said it became suspicious after turnout rates shot up in certain precincts and its requests to view records were denied			2
" we are not approaching it from a belief of who should have won the race			0
let 's find out what the actual final score was , and which points were legitimate and which were not on either side , " said @entity211 , @entity180 's communications director			0
" at the end of the day we do n't care who wins or loses			0
" @entity211 explained that the group gathered complaints from @entity7 voters who said they observed violations of election law			2

state party says group misunderstands the law the nonprofit 's lawsuit was joined by 13 @entity7 voters , several of whom are affiliated with the tea party			1
they claim that election officials denied some of their requests to view voting records or demanded " exorbitant fees , " @entity211 said			1
@entity249 , the chairman of the @entity159 , said in a statement that @entity253 the vote 's lawsuit is based on a " misunderstanding of both @entity7 law " and the state party 's role in the election			2
" since these allegations do not include anything the @entity262 did or is doing wrong , we will ask to be released from this lawsuit soon , " @entity249 said			0
the lawsuit asks for full access to unredacted @entity7 election records for the @entity6 primary -- which would include voters ' birth dates and @entity271 numbers -- to allow @entity253 the vote to accurately verify whether illegal ballots were counted			1
@entity274 , a professor at @entity275 , @entity276 , and an expert in national election law , said he believes a thorough review of election records will reveal fewer illegal votes than skeptics of the runoff claim			0
@entity274 said that partial election records , like those reviewed by @entity180 and @entity12 supporters , can often overstate voter fraud , which is later revealed as clerical error or due to voters with identical names and birth dates -- which @entity274 said is actually very common			1
" it 's always difficult to predict what is going to happen , " @entity274 said			0
" they can give more or less of a thumbs up or down on each of the lawsuit 's claims			2
" while the group may gain access to more election records through the lawsuit , @entity300 law professor @entity299 said it is unlikely the review of records will lead to a new election			1
" i do n't think showing that 1 to 2 % of the electorate had some irregularity is enough , " @entity299 said			0
