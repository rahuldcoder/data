@entity0 -- two distinctive @entity3 presidential candidates , one representing resurgent @entity4 and the other a weathered veteran of the country 's old guard , have begun maneuvering for wider political support ahead of an expected runoff next month			2
@entity12 candidate @entity11 huddled with politicians saturday to stave off what his campaign sees as a return to the policies of longtime president @entity18 , toppled last year in the country 's historic uprising			1
" we face desperate attempts to replicate the old system of governance in new attire that might fool some , but the masses of our people and the enlightened revolutionary forces will not give these the opportunity , " the @entity11 campaign said in a statement			1
" we must , together , seek out ways to save the blessed revolution			0
" yet his opponent , former prime minister @entity34 , distanced himself from @entity3 's deposed leader as he briefed reporters , saying there 's " no going back " to the @entity18 years			1
" we hear talks about deals , compromises that some are trying to make			0
i assure to you that the only deal that we need to make at this moment is with the @entity3 people , " @entity34 said			1
" to all @entity3 from all parties and to all the independents , to the children of april 6 movement , your revolution has been hijacked from you , the revolution that you have started			0
therefore , i pledge to you that i will do my best to restore its glory back to you and that you will be in the front lines of this new phase			0
" there were 13 candidates on the first - round presidential ballot , although two withdrew from the race after ballots were printed			0
if no candidate gets a majority of the vote in the first round , the top two will progress to a runoff to be held june 16 - 17			1
the winner of the landmark vote will become @entity3 's first freely elected president			1
a runoff between @entity11 and @entity34 appears likely , according to unofficial results reported by @entity3 newspaper @entity73			1
@entity3 elections officials said the results being published by the media were " not inaccurate			2
" the unofficial @entity73 count gave @entity11 25 % of the vote with results in from all 27 provinces , with @entity34 close behind with 24 % of the vote			1
in third at 22 % is leftist @entity83			0
@entity11 is an @entity84 - educated engineer who vows to stand for democracy , women 's rights and peaceful relations with @entity88 if he wins the @entity3 presidency			1
still , he 's an @entity4 figure who has argued for barring women from the @entity3 presidency and called @entity88 leaders " vampires " and " killers			2
" @entity34 , also a former air force officer with close ties to @entity3 's powerful military , is seen as representing the interests of the old guard -- those who lost out when president @entity18 was ousted			1
on saturday , @entity83 stressed to reporters that the final results have not yet been announced and said his campaign has filed appeals			1
" with the will of the people , we will succeed			0
the @entity3 administration is looking at evidence of fraud , " he said , according to his @entity114 page			0
" all of the evidence proves that we acquired most of the votes and i thank the people for their valuable trust , " @entity83 said			0
@entity120 's count put @entity121 , a moderate @entity4 running as an independent , and @entity123 , who previously served as foreign minister and headed the @entity125 , in fourth and fifth places , respectively			1
former @entity84 president @entity127 , who led a delegation observing the voting , told reporters in @entity0 he could n't say " the entire process has been proper " because of some restraints on observers			1
but the group found the election period to be peaceful , with citizens accepting the voting process as " quite successful			2
" " there were many violations , and i think each violation is serious			0
but i think collectively they did not affect the basic integrity of the election , " he said			1
@entity127 said there were no apparent patterns in election procedures that " favored a particular candidate			1
" @entity149 , official spokesman for @entity3 's prosecutor - general , said his office is working with the country 's election officials to investigate voter " irregularities			2
" most of them are from the @entity11 , @entity34 and @entity123 campaigns			1
" this matter will be taken very seriously before the announcement of official results , " @entity149 said			2
the @entity161 has finished its collection and examination of the first - round votes , having " confirmed and validated ( their ) safety and accuracy , " according to a report saturday from the state - run @entity169			0
a meeting will take place sunday afternoon to discuss appeals , as well as to set the date when the official results will be announced , the report said			1
" a lot of @entity3 will feel like this is the worst choice that they would have to make because if it really is between @entity11 and @entity34 , then these are the two most polarizing candidates , " @entity180 , a visiting fellow at the @entity181 in @entity182 who is currently in @entity3			1
if the first - round results in a runoff between @entity11 and @entity34 , many @entity3 -- particularly liberals and " revolutionaries " -- will be very disappointed , @entity180 said @entity83 has had the backing of many who supported the @entity0 's @entity190 uprising last year to protest @entity18 's rule			1
@entity83 is a proponent of late and revered @entity3 leader @entity192 , who ruled the country in the ' 50s and ' 60s			0
@entity180 said it is hard to predict where the votes of liberals and revolutionaries will go if they do participate , but the @entity12 will have to work hard if it wants to win them over , having alienated many in the past			2
many people may opt to stay at home rather than make a " very difficult choice " in the runoff , @entity180 said			0
there is also a chance of further protests and even violence regardless of who wins , @entity180 said , as revolutionary elements become increasingly marginalized and radicalized			0
@entity18 led the @entity213 nation for 30 years before being forced out last year amid a popular outcry			2
the voting is a monumental achievement for those who worked to topple @entity18 in one of the seminal developments of the @entity220			2
and it could reverberate far beyond the country 's borders , since @entity3 is in many ways the center of gravity of the @entity125 world			2
distrust and anger in @entity3 , particularly against the military 's power in governmental affairs , have inspired continued protests , some of which have been marked by deadly clashes			0
many protesters are upset about what they see as the slow pace of reform since @entity18 's ouster			1
some are also concerned that the country 's military leadership is delaying the transition to civilian rule			0
worries about the powerful military possibly swaying this week 's vote persist despite the insistence of the @entity251 that it will hand over power to an elected civilian government			0
the military leaders put armored personnel carriers on the streets with loudspeakers broadcasting a message that they will relinquish power , but that did not convince doubters			0
in january , two @entity4 parties -- the @entity262 with 235 seats and the conservative @entity264 with 121 seats -- won about 70 % of the seats in the lower house of parliament in the first elections for an elected governing body in the @entity272 era			0
the rest of the assembly 's 498 seats were divided among other parties			0
@entity1 's @entity277 and @entity278 , and journalists @entity279 and @entity281 contributed to this report .			0
