-- @entity1 never imagined he would be running an internet dating service			2
as a young boy it was technology that fascinated him			0
so much so that @entity6 started a software consulting company before he even began high school			1
he clearly had drive and a head for business , but matchmaking ? it is not as far off as it may sound			0
@entity14 uses advanced technology to create personality profiles to match prospective couples , and it was that element that convinced @entity6 to become an early investor			1
" my background is in technology and i came to @entity14 loving the research and scientific part of it , but once you start realizing what we are doing for our subscribers and you start seeing all the successes , the families that have been created ... i really do n't think there is another job i can imagine doing other than being ceo of @entity14			1
" @entity14 says its goal is not just to find users dates -- it wants them to get married			1
in fact , the company claims that 236 people a day in the @entity39 are married as a result of meeting through their site			2
their success has not come without controversy			0
the company was sued in @entity45 for excluding gays			1
others have complained they have been turned down without explanation			0
when i asked @entity6 about this , he said that in the future the company may look into providing different services , including same - sex , but that at the moment their research was designed specifically for heterosexual couples looking for marriage			1
i also asked about religion			0
@entity14 's founder , @entity60 , was an evangelical @entity61 with strong ties to the conservative @entity61 movement in the @entity39			1
@entity1 said the company had no connection to any religion and was open to people of all faiths who were looking for a happy long - term relationship			2
one of the perils of being ceo of a matchmaking service is that people tend to think you are an expert on the subject			0
he joked about people asking him to comment on celebrity couples during interviews and getting tapped for dating advice at dinner parties			0
but all kidding aside , @entity6 is acutely aware of how sensitive the business can be			1
" this is a service that people come to with incredible expectations , that presents a challenge for us , because they want to meet their soul mate			0
" though he is passionate about @entity14 's ability to help people find love , @entity1 met his wife the old - fashioned way -- through friends !			2
