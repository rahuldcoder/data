-- the @entity1 who was elected in 1960 was not going to change the world			1
his major charge against the @entity5 administration was that it was not prosecuting the @entity6 vigorously			2
he believed that its policy of @entity9 in the event of any attack meant @entity7 would be incapable of a flexible response to a non-nuclear communist aggression in the @entity14 , where , he believed , the @entity6 would be won or lost			1
he aimed to close any missile gap ( actually non-existent ) with the @entity17			2
he aimed to beat the @entity18 to the moon			2
he planned to calm business fears by appointing a @entity22 secretary of the treasury			0
he wanted to avoid coercive civil rights legislation or the use of federal troops to enforce segregation because he put his faith in white southern moderate leaders			0
the @entity1 who was assassinated in 1963 had begun to change the world			1
admittedly , the failure of the @entity31 did not lessen the enthusiasm of either the president or his brother , @entity34 , for covert action and counter-insurgency			0
the military advisers committed to @entity38 were part of a flexible response -- but so was the inspirational @entity41			0
but chastened by confronting the @entity18 over @entity42 and missiles in @entity44 , and reassured by the knowledge that the missile build - up had guaranteed a measure of @entity6 stability , @entity1 moved to lessen @entity6 tensions and the dangers of nuclear war			1
he started a backchannel correspondence with @entity53			0
he negotiated , in the face of military opposition , a @entity55 which aimed to eliminate nuclear tests in the atmosphere			0
he was the first @entity7 president in the @entity6 to talk about the @entity17 as an adversary with whom the @entity7 should peacefully compete , rather than an enemy to be defeated militarily			1
except in the @entity60 in 1973 the world never again came close to a nuclear holocaust			0
under @entity1 the first steps to @entity64 were taken			1
@entity1 was the first president to understand the @entity66			2
at home , he proposed a tax cut , not as a result of a budget surplus , but despite a budget deficit , in order to stimulate the economy			0
as a result of the crisis created by violent resistance in the @entity78 to civil rights protest , the president was forced to do the two things he did not want to do			0
he sent in federal troops to force the admission of a black student to the @entity84			0
after the @entity86 demonstrations and the defiance of governor @entity88 on the steps of the @entity90 , he went on national television to promise strong civil rights legislation and acknowledged for the first time that civil rights was an inescapable moral issue			0
@entity1 's assassination and @entity98 's masterly leadership guaranteed the eventual passage of the civil rights bill and the tax cut			1
it did not interrupt the progress towards @entity104 © tente			0
but @entity1 's death did put an end to third - party efforts to normalize relations with @entity44			1
@entity1 might have gone on to re-orient policy towards @entity110			2
would he have avoided the @entity38 disaster ? @entity1 's defenders argue passionately that , protected by a big re-election win in 1964 , he would have withdrawn @entity7 troops from @entity38			1
but his @entity38 policy in late 1963 in which he acquiesced in the overthrow of president @entity118 's government was already locked in a policy of sustaining a @entity38 government that was ready to fight the communists			2
he had effectively narrowed the options available to his successor			0
there is little evidence that he would have sanctioned the " loss " of @entity38			2
faced with the impossibility of finding a government that was both popular and willing to fight the @entity129 , how would @entity1 have avoided the commitment of ground troops in 1965 ? advised by @entity132 and @entity133 , who guided @entity38 policy under both @entity1 and @entity98 , would @entity1 have been prepared to scale down the @entity7 commitment and see the @entity38 regime collapse ? @entity138 ambassador and friend of the @entity140 , @entity141 , tried to console @entity142 by telling her that the late president , " had great things to do and would have done them			1
" the jury may be out on that judgment			0
but the @entity138 reacted with the same grief as the @entity7 to a lifer cut short , to the cruel death of a young man whose vigor and youth contrasted so markedly with the contemporary political leaders of an older generation : @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157			1
they established at @entity159 , the site of the signing of @entity162 , a memorial funded by popular appeal and driven by cross-party consensus on an acre of land permanently ceded to the @entity7			2
@entity141 , as @entity168 , was the first chair of the @entity170 which also awarded scholarships to the " best and the brightest " of @entity138 students to do graduate work at @entity174 and @entity175			0
on friday , as current chair of the @entity170 , i will be laying a wreath at the memorial			0
why does @entity1 's memory still resonate ? perhaps it is because contemporary @entity7 politics is dysfunctional and anti-intellectual fundamentalism is so rampant in @entity7 public life			1
@entity1 was familiar enough with congressional gridlock and only too aware of the paranoid style of @entity7 politics on the extreme right			1
but he was the modern @entity7 president who was most comfortable in his own skin , who surrounded himself with intellectuals and delighted in their company , and who made government service an honorable calling after the ravages of @entity197			1
@entity1 may not have changed the world and his assassination may not have significantly altered @entity7 's future , but 50 years on it is not surprising that his memory still evokes a profound sense of loss			1
@entity205 : @entity1 's alleged affairs the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity209 .			1

@entity209 argues it is not surprising that @entity1 's memory still evokes a sense of loss
it still resonate because contemporary @entity7 politics is dysfunctional , he says
@entity1 surrounded himself with intellectuals , made government service an honorable calling
