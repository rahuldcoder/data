-- @entity1 has endured many highs and lows in his 25 years at @entity4 , so perhaps it was fitting that saturday 's much - anticipated anniversary celebration featured some of both extremes			1
the @entity9 is the most successful manager in @entity11 football , and his status as the longest - serving one in @entity4 's history was cemented when the @entity16 champions renamed the biggest stand at @entity18 in his honor			1
it is the first time in the ground 's 101 years that a section has been named after an individual			2
club officials have also commissioned an award - winning @entity26 sculptor , @entity25 , to build a statue of the 69 - year - old to be erected outside the stand 's entrance next year			2
" i was really emotional			0
i could n't believe it			0
i did n't expect that			0
i have to thank the club , it 's fantastic of them to do that , " @entity1 told reporters after the nervy 1 - 0 victory over @entity36			1
@entity4 he stands : the real @entity1 the match was won thanks to an own - goal by former @entity4 defender @entity44 just before halftime , and kept @entity4 in second place in the table -- five points behind local rivals @entity49 , who battled to a 3 - 2 win at @entity52 in the late kickoff			1
@entity36 , managed by @entity57 -- whose headed goal against @entity56 gave @entity1 his first of 12 @entity59 titles in the inaugural 1992 - 93 @entity16 season -- almost spoiled the celebrations			1
referee @entity62 awarded the visitors a penalty in the 68th minute when his linesman @entity65 flagged that young @entity4 defender @entity66 had handled the ball , but then overturned the decision			2
" that last 15 minutes was torture , " @entity1 said			0
" i 'd have been quite happy if the whistle had gone at halftime when we were 1 - 0 up			0
@entity36 threw everything at us and played very well in that last 15 minutes			0
" @entity1 said the week 's hype may have got to his team			2
" it was an anxious day for the players			0
i think they showed that			0
they wanted to do well for me , " he said			0
" these occasions can be a wee bit like that			0
i remember the 50th anniversary of the @entity86 air disaster and we lost 2 - 0 to @entity49			1
that got to the players that day			0
maybe it happened a little bit today			0
" @entity57 was at @entity4 for nine years as a player , but has yet to beat his former boss in 17 attempts as a manager			1
" he welcomed me in with a great glass of wine and said , ' unlucky again '			0
i 'll be his age before i get a result here , " @entity57 said			0
" but i have to say the tribute , naming the stand after him -- i 've never known anything at @entity4 kept a secret			2
it 's quite remarkable and fitting , too			0
" i said to him maybe he 's taken his finger off the pulse because he did n't know what was going on ! " however , @entity49 showed that @entity4 have a real challenge to add to @entity1 's long list of trophies after coming from behind the first time in the league this season to beat a @entity52 side that has already defeated @entity118			1
@entity120 's men crushed @entity121 3 - 0 in the @entity122 in midweek , but went behind in the 28th minute when striker @entity123 headed in @entity125 's free - kick			1
@entity126 leveled two minutes before halftime with his 10th league goal this season , with the @entity131 striker cutting inside defender @entity132 -- who is at the center of the racism allegations aimed at @entity118 's @entity137 captain @entity136 -- and slotted in a low shot			0
@entity49 's playmaker @entity139 showed his customary sublime control to take @entity126 's low cross and fire in at the near post seven minutes after the break , but @entity52 leveled on 69 when @entity123 's header hit teammate @entity145 in the back and deflected past wrongfooted goalkeeper @entity147			1
@entity148 followed up wednesday 's goal in @entity150 with another crucial strike as the @entity153 midfielder leaped high to head the 74th - minute winner , leaving promoted @entity52 in 12th place			1
@entity157 's impressive run continued with a 2 - 1 win at home to @entity160 that kept @entity162 's team three points clear of fourth - placed @entity118			1
an own - goal from @entity160 defender @entity165 and a superb long - range shot from fullback @entity167 put @entity157 2 - 0 ahead by the half hour , while @entity168 reduced the deficit in time added on at the end of the first period			1
@entity118 , still awaiting the outcome of the investigation into @entity136 's alleged comments by both police and the @entity177 , bounced back from two successive league defeats with a 1 - 0 victory at struggling @entity180			1
midfielder @entity181 scored his sixth goal this campaign to leave the home side in the bottom three , with defender @entity136 starting after being rested for the 1 - 1 @entity186 draw with @entity188 side @entity187 on tuesday			1
@entity189 missed the chance to move above fifth - placed @entity191 -- who travel to @entity193 on sunday -- after being held 0 - 0 by mid-table @entity194			0
striker @entity195 hit the bar as @entity198 's team dropped points at home for the third match in a row , while the promoted @entity204 side moved to 10th place			2
@entity206 joined @entity191 and @entity189 on 19 points after a 3 - 0 win at home to @entity210 , again inspired by @entity211			1
the @entity212 responded to being named as a substitute in the midweek 0 - 0 draw with @entity215 by scoring his league - leading 11th goal this season from close range in the 22nd minute			0
he then set up defender @entity220 six minutes before halftime , and was involved in @entity223 's 74th - minute strike as @entity225 's team notched a fifth successive league victory			2
@entity227 moved up to eighth on 15 points with a 3 - 2 victory at home to @entity231 , which lifted @entity233 's team above the promoted visitors			1
@entity227 came from behind as @entity235 canceled out @entity237 's 25th - minute opener , and @entity238 pounced on a defensive error before setting up his strike partner 's second goal on 62 -- which made @entity243 's late effort a consolation for ninth - placed @entity49 .			2
