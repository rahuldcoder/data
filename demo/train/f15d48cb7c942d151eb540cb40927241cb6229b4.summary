@entity0 , @entity1 -- -- the end of the line for hundreds of detained @entity6 children is a @entity8 naval base along the scenic @entity9 outside @entity10			1
just down the road is celebrity - drenched @entity12			0
this is @entity14 , where 204 children from @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 were being temporarily housed friday as part of the latest crisis in @entity8 's immigration system : a surge in @entity6 minors daring to cross the @entity8 - @entity25 border alone , or with younger siblings			1
the base is better known as home to sailors and @entity30 , not @entity32 - speaking children temporarily orphaned			1
the quarters are expected to be at capacity , 575 children , by tuesday , 11 days after the facility opened			1
posters about " @entity38 " and " 123 " and @entity8 leaders such as president @entity40 and @entity41 share the wall with @entity8 red , white and blue ribbons			0
bunks in a barracks - like setting are brightened with pastel - colored blankets			0
some bedspreads even have flower patterns			0
dorms and activities are segregated by sex , but boys and girls eat meals together , officials said			0
the boldly colored touches are the government 's effort to make the wide halls and tall walls feel less institutional for the detained children , who are between 13 and 17 years old			1
" it 's not like they 're militarized , " @entity65 spokesman lt. col. @entity64 said of the shelters on armed forces ' bases in @entity1 and two other states			1
" there 's no military			1
there 's no military environment			2
" officials with the @entity8 @entity79 are operating the temporary shelters , not the @entity65 , @entity64 said			1
@entity79 is also running similar shelters for immigrant children on @entity83 in @entity84 and @entity85 in @entity86			1
the emergence of child detainees at the @entity14 base is something the city of @entity0 can handle , mayor @entity87 told @entity2 affiliate @entity93			1
" on the @entity0 side alone , there are at least 5,000 military folks here all the time , " @entity87 said			0
" this is a very busy base			0
it 's a big base			2
this particular program is very small			0
it will have no impact at all as far as the city is concerned			0
" since june 6 when the new @entity1 shelter opened , 15 of the @entity6 children have left the facility and were handed over to relatives or vetted sponsors , said @entity79 spokesman @entity110			1
under @entity8 law , detained @entity6 immigrant children are treated differently than those from @entity25 and @entity114 : the @entity6 youths are n't deported immediately but rather are turned over to @entity79 within 72 hours of custody , officials said			1
after being held in @entity79 facilities , the children end up in the care of their parents or relatives living in the @entity8 or in the care of a sponsor 's group home , officials said			1
during that process , the immigrant child is given a court date			0
but very few show up to court , and the children often become some of the millions of undocumented immigrants in the @entity8 , said a union official for @entity135 agents			2
consulates respond el @entity16 vice consul @entity137 in @entity10 said the consulate will ask children in the shelter for any supporting documents such as a birth certificate			1
however , unaccompanied children in detention facilities sometimes give a fake name , @entity137 said			1
" that 's a problem , " he said			2
" in most of the cases , they use their real names			2
sometimes they use a different one because they think if i do n't give my real name , i 'm not going to have a problem ... being removed back to my own country , i can come back later " to the @entity8 , @entity137 said			0
that belief is a mistake because @entity8 authorities fingerprint the children for identification , @entity137 said			2
some children become crime victims during their solo journeys , he added			2
and some are never found			2
parents and relatives " should be happy to know that their kids are alive , " he said			0
" we have sad stories , " @entity137 said			0
" there are so many times that kids are never found			2
we do n't know what happened to them			0
" @entity17 consul general @entity175 in @entity10 will visit the facility monday to see how many @entity17 children need assistance , and also whether they have parents or other relatives in the @entity8			1
" it 's very , very important to visit			2
it 's necessary to talk to the children about what happened , what do you need ... who can pick them up , " @entity175 said			1
three - fourths of children are from three countries three - fourths of the unaccompanied children crossing the @entity8 - @entity25 border come from three @entity6 countries : @entity17 , @entity16 and @entity18 , said @entity195 secretary @entity194			1
@entity196 , an attorney at @entity197 in @entity10 , said several nonprofit legal groups like hers are overloaded with cases and have determined it 's too far to travel to the naval base , about a 70 - mile drive from downtown @entity10			0
her group ca n't make the long trip , she said			0
@entity196 is concerned the children or their @entity8 relatives will not find attorneys			0
the children and their families often do n't go to their court hearings because they do n't understand or have access to legal services , @entity196 said			0
" i think it 's in everybody 's interest to provide these children with attorneys , " she said			1
" my worry is that we might have trafficking victims , bona fide refugees , people fleeing violence in their country who need legal representation and need legal help			0
" it 's the only type of legal proceedings in the @entity8 where we expect children to represent themselves , so you have children as young as 5 years old being expected to present a very complicated case for defense against deportation , against a skilled government attorney and a judge , " @entity196 said			1
before the @entity1 naval base releases any child to relatives , the family members must sign an agreement to attend immigration hearings , officials said .			0
