-- " i do n't consider criminal background checks to be gun control			1
" @entity5 @entity4 sen. @entity4 made this profound statement earlier this week while announcing a bipartisan @entity8 agreement to expand background checks to almost all gun purchasers			2
background checks are not about gun control , they 're about human safety			1
having checks will make it more difficult for criminals and the insane to obtain guns			0
yet , despite polls showing that over 90 % of @entity21 support universal background checks , it took a " breakthrough " deal to get this proposal simply to a vote by the @entity8			0
what 's worse , there 's no guarantee this legislation will pass the @entity5 - controlled @entity31			2
@entity33 ' exasperating struggle to enact a law supported by most @entity21 is topic no. 1 of this week 's episode of the @entity0 podcast , " the @entity38 , " co-hosted by @entity40 contributors @entity41 , @entity42 and myself			1
each week we look at three big issues from the week			2
the second big issue is the death of @entity49 's former prime minister @entity48			1
is the fawning over her justified or did her failings outweigh her accomplishments ? and third , is the new song by country singer @entity55 and rapper @entity56 , titled , " @entity57 , " racially insensitive , or in today 's hypersensitive climate is it simply impossible to discuss race without causing an outcry ? to listen to this episode of " the @entity38 , " click on the @entity63 audio player on this page			1
or you can find us on @entity67			0
here 's a brief summary of this week 's episode : 1			0
gun safety laws @entity42 discussed the cowardice of the @entity5 senators who threatened a filibuster to prevent a vote on the proposed universal background check law , a point he also raised in his most recent column			1
@entity41 -- a reasonable voice on the right ( almost an oxymoron ) -- agreed that @entity5 senators like @entity83 could cause the entire @entity5 to appear as extremists if they prevented a vote on this proposal via filibuster			2
i made the case that we need to stop calling these measures " gun control " laws and instead label them as " human safety " laws because the focus is on saving lives , not grabbing guns			1
i also raised the point : is the second amendment out of date ? it was enacted when we had 13 states , a population of 4 million and muskets			0
should we consider revising or repealing the second amendment to bring it up to date with today 's world so that owning guns is a privilege rather than a right ? 2			0
death of @entity48 @entity41 , a big @entity48 fan , shared the thrill of meeting the former prime minister years ago			1
i refused to speak ill of the recently deceased @entity48			2
so instead , i read excerpts from a recent op - ed penned by @entity120 comedian @entity119 ( we all know comedians tend to write the best opinion pieces )			0
brand was highly critical of @entity48 's reign			1
@entity42 and @entity41 both defended @entity48 from @entity119 's allegations that she was an uncaring person who favored the wealthy at the expense of the working class			1
' @entity57 ' @entity55 and @entity56 recorded a song in the hopes of easing racial tension and fostering more understanding			0
instead , their song was met by almost universal criticism			0
some said the lyrics are culturally insensitive , others said it 's just bad			0
all three of us agreed that some of the lyrics were ridiculous , such as @entity56 's line : " if you do n't judge my gold chains / i 'll forget the iron chains			0
" was @entity56 really saying that if a white man does n't judge his choice of flashy jewelry , then @entity21 should forget slavery ? but the bigger point we discussed is that it 's almost impossible to talk about race in @entity154 without being attacked by people on both the far left and far right			1
i also tell a joke about " white people " that i had performed last month on a tv show that generated an avalanche of angry tweets and e-mails			0
just shows , we 've gone a long way to go			0
we hope you will give a listen to this episode of " the @entity38 " -- and let us know what you think about the issues we discussed			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity170 .			2

@entity170 : get rid of the label " gun control " laws ; they are really " human safety " laws
