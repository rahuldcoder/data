-- nearly two centuries ago wednesday , @entity2 gov. @entity1 signed an obscure redistricting law that helped his party stay in office and , more importantly , codified one of the most enduring legacies in @entity9 politics : gerrymandering			1
the @entity9 @entity11 , home to many beneficiaries of gerrymandering			1
now a part of an @entity9 lexicon often heard in @entity19 's @entity18 bars and among " inside - the - beltway " crowds , the term is seen as a combination of the governor 's name and the word " salamander , " because of the salamander - like shape one electoral district took on after the redistricting			1
elected governor in 1810 , @entity1 signed the redistricting bill two years later , enabling greater and perhaps disproportionate @entity34 representation in the @entity2 legislature			1
the controversial move has become a favorite across the country among incumbent parties , which pack opposition voters into districts already lost in an effort to minimize the opposition 's influence over the state 's broader electorate			1
but some political analysts cry foul			2
" in the end , democracy comes out the big loser , " former federal prosecutor @entity49 wrote in a 2004 column for @entity0			0
" the effect of such partisan gerrymandering is to block new entrants into high political office and to make the result of almost every congressional election a foregone conclusion			1
this , in turn , effectively disenfranchises all those voters who do n't support the preordained winner , " he wrote			2
in 2006 , the @entity66 threw out part of a @entity69 congressional map , but found the overall redistricting plan orchestrated by @entity71 acceptable			1
the redistricting helped @entity34 in @entity69 defeat four @entity74 congressmen in the 2004 elections			2
the court ruled that the redistricting plan , promoted by then - @entity9 house majority leader @entity78 , unfairly weakened the voting strength of @entity80 in two congressional districts			1
" a state may not trade off the rights of some members of a racial group against the rights of other members of that group , " wrote justice @entity82			0
" the question is therefore not whether line - drawing in the challenged area as a whole dilutes minority voting strength , but whether line - drawing dilutes the voting strength of the @entity80 in [ @entity69 ' ] @entity96			0
" the court ordered that @entity98 be redrawn			0
states are constitutionally required to redraw congressional districts every 10 years in line with population shifts documented by the @entity103 , a part of the @entity105			1
this year , controversy re-emerged when president @entity107 announced a decision to cross party lines and nominate @entity9 sen. @entity110 , @entity111 , to run the @entity105			2
the move sparked criticism from leaders of minority groups concerned that the @entity103 under @entity110 , who voted to abolish the @entity105 in 1995 , might lack the resources needed to accurately count minorities			0
the @entity119 promised to work directly with bureau 's director to assuage those concerns , but that response drew further criticism from @entity71 concerned about greater executive influence in the @entity103			0
in a letter to the president , @entity11 republicans @entity126 and @entity128 described the @entity119 as " circumventing the secretary of commerce " and called it " both outrageous and unprecedented , " suggesting the @entity107 administration could affect @entity9 census results and congressional districting due out in 2010			1
the move , they say , could insulate @entity74 congressional power			0
the @entity119 said it recognizes the importance of an accurate census count " free from politicization " and added it " has not proposed removing the census from the @entity105			0
" " from the first days of the transition , the census has been a priority for the president , and a process he wanted to re-evaluate , " it said in an earlier statement			0
the method through which the @entity103 collects data has long been a topic of partisan bickering			0
@entity34 have generally favored the " door - to - door " approach , which actually is done primarily by self - enumeration through the @entity9 mail			2
@entity74 commonly prefer a statistical sampling method meant to fill in " population gaps " they say occur because some members of minority groups and homeless populations are missed by the door - to - door approach			0
a 1999 @entity66 ruling said statistical sampling could not be applied to the redistribution of congressional seats , but it did not put gerrymandering of the political landscape entirely off limits			2
so , almost 200 years after @entity1 helped coin the term , gerrymandering remains a key part of @entity9 politics			1
@entity0 's @entity176 and @entity177 contributed to this report .			0

@entity180 coined after @entity2 gov. @entity1 signed redistricting law in early 1800s
political parties can use *tactic* to pack opposition voters into districts already lost
gerrymandering still a key part of @entity9 politics
it 's already becoming an issue with the 2010 census *looming*
