-- the @entity1 has long been known worldwide for its engineering programs , and a symposium at @entity1 this week will draw scientists from around the globe to focus on a hot facet of the field -- climate engineering			1
the title of the symposium itself underscores the questions surrounding climate - changing science : " @entity15 : can we do it ? should we try ? " climate engineering may sound a little frankensteinian and worrisome , but it 's not a new concept			1
governments and militaries have tried over the years to control the weather for various reasons -- and have mostly failed			1
in the past decade , though , scientists have made major strides in developing technologies to cool the globe , and some of these processes are are gaining momentum among those who think drastic measures are needed to control the warming @entity31			0
the subject is rife with controversy , including whether intentional climate engineering itself is even new			1
" very broadly , we 're already engineering the climate			2
the question now is whether we should do it on purpose , " said @entity1 associate professor of environmental policy and symposium participant @entity42			1
" that would involve taking action , inventing gizmos , and using them ideally to abate some of the warming that is expected to happen from global climate change			1
" but not everyone agrees that , through decades of massive pollution , humans have already interfered with the climate on a global scale , albeit unintentionally			2
@entity57 is a professor of science , technology and society at @entity61 in @entity62 , and a speaker at the upcoming symposium			2
" it 's the inadvertent , ' engineering through pollution ' argument , and i do n't really agree with it , " @entity57 said			2
" i 'm a historian of science , and i believe humans have been intervening on purpose for much longer than people will admit			0
so one of the lessons of climate engineering , i think , is that some climate engineers insist they 're the first generation to purpose this deliberate manipulation			2
... i think history says otherwise			0
" there are several geo - engineering processes getting a lot of attention right now			1
creating an artificial cloud cover , or modifying clouds to reflect light back into space , is one of them			1
but probably the more popular climate engineering technology now involves pumping sulfates into the atmosphere to block the sun 's rays and cool temperatures , similar to what happens in volcanic eruptions			1
" in 1830 , the first national meteorologist of the @entity97 , @entity96 , proposed making artificial volcanoes of his own			2
so whether it 's weather or climate , this manipulation has been proposed and , in some cases attempted , for a very long time , " @entity57 said			1
weather manipulation or modification can be traced to the 1940s and ' 50s , with a process called cloud seeding			1
in cloud seeding , many chemicals -- including dry ice and silver iodide -- were tried to produce rain or snow			1
in fact , author @entity115 's brother , @entity114 , invented silver iodide when he worked at @entity118 in the 1950s			2
the @entity119 and @entity120 have bragged about having weather - modifying technology for years			2
" the @entity119 have been claiming to have brought good weather to the @entity123 for their parades			0
and the mayor of @entity126 just said he was going to stop all snow in the city for the whole winter , but he did n't get a good response from the suburbs , " @entity57 said			0
@entity1 's @entity42 thinks climate engineering will create new problems that will need their own solutions			1
" the idea of taking a symptom of global warming , which is heat , and trying to mitigate that symptom seems to me to be just another form of parceling a large and comprehensive problem into bits and pieces , which will in turn need solutions			0
" @entity42 also sees it this way : " climate engineering is just another example of treating a symptom			0
treating problems in a piecemeal way , actually you just move the problem from one place to another			0
if you take pollution out of the air , you still have it			0
you have to put it somewhere , so you put it in the water			0
then you 've polluted the water			0
" all these issues will come up for discussion at the @entity1 symposium friday			1
@entity57 sums up the symposium as a chance perhaps to learn what might not work , in addition to what might			0
" tinkering with the planet is dangerous , " he said			0
" the lessons would be very similar to those learned in the weather control experiments			0
it would be very difficult to measure and it might have incredible inadvertent and unwelcome side effects			0

@entity1 symposium set to ask *crucial* questions about man 's ability to change climate
some argue man has already manipulated the climate -- *unwittingly*
others argue trying to manipulate the weather could have unintended consequences
artificial cloud cover to reflect back sunlight is one idea getting a lot of attention
