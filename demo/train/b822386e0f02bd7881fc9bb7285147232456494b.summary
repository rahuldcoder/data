@entity2 airstrikes helped @entity4 and @entity5 forces take control of @entity7 on monday , fighting back @entity9 militants who had seized the dam , president @entity0 told reporters			1
the stakes were huge for the millions of @entity5 who live downstream from the dam , the largest in the country			2
" if that dam was breached it could have proven catastrophic , with floods that would have threatened the lives of thousands of civilians and endangered our embassy compound in @entity23 , " the president said			2
the dam has been the center of an intense battle in northern @entity25 between the @entity27 extremists and @entity4 forces that had been fighting to retake it since saturday with @entity2 air support			1
" the @entity2 military used fighters , bombers , attack and unmanned aircraft to conduct 35 strikes , " said @entity31 spokesman rear adm. @entity30			1
" we destroyed over 90 targets including a range of vehicles , equipment and fighting positions , " he said			1
now that the dam is cleared of @entity9 militants , @entity5 forces are moving to grow their area of control , the @entity31 said			1
" this operation demonstrates that @entity5 and @entity4 forces are capable of working together and taking the fight to @entity9 , " @entity0 said			1
" if they continue to do so , they will have the strong support of the @entity2			2
" taking the fight to @entity9 @entity2 airstrikes may not be enough to do the job of ridding @entity25 of @entity9 forces , said retired col. @entity56 , a former @entity57 intelligence officer			1
" at the core of the mission is to get rid of @entity9 , " he said			2
" the @entity2 can not have a @entity60 in which @entity9 exists , " he said			1
the brutal attacks of @entity9 militants as they took control of towns and villages in northern @entity25 forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee			1
" @entity9 tells people to pay or convert , " said one @entity67 man who fled @entity9 forces			1
a @entity67 village near @entity7 is almost deserted			2
some of its residents fled just in time to a monastery in the mountains			0
" we were afraid , terrified they 'd call us infidels , " a @entity67 woman there told @entity77 's @entity76			0
" my @entity81 friend told me to just leave			0
" now she said she hopes @entity9 fighters wo n't reach the monastery			0
the @entity2 strategy in fighting @entity9 is " to take out @entity9 ' leadership , to degrade their operational capabilities , to cut off their financing sources , " @entity85 spokeswoman @entity84 said monday			1
on several @entity9 websites , the group posted a message monday threatening that " @entity2 will disappear from the map soon on the hands of knights of @entity97 , " a reference to the caliphate @entity9 claims it wants to recapture			1
water in war when @entity9 militants seized the dam this month , many feared it could be used as a weapon			2
built in the early 1980s under former @entity5 dictator @entity103 , the dam sits on the @entity104 about 50 kilometers ( 30 miles ) north of the city of @entity7			1
it serves as a key source of electricity , irrigation and flood protection			0
@entity9 has a track record of attacking its enemies with water			0
this year , its fighters opened the gates on the @entity115 in central @entity25 after seizing it in an effort to stop an @entity5 military advance			1
the water from the dam flooded a number of villages			0
" @entity9 has already used other smaller dams to gain control of territory , to pressure @entity127 to support them and to punish the @entity128 , " @entity122 , president of the @entity123 , told @entity77 this month			2
the 3.2 - kilometer - long @entity7 holds back as much as 12.5 million cubic meters of water , according to @entity130 , a construction industry website			0
if the structure were to give way , it would unleash a wall of water tens of feet tall that would race down the @entity104 toward @entity7 and its 1.7 million inhabitants			0
it would also bring flooding to major cities farther downstream , including @entity23			0
' very poor foundation ' but even if the militant group does n't try to destroy the dam , concerns remain about its sturdiness			0
a @entity146 report in 2006 said that what made the dam especially dangerous was the risk of internal erosion of its foundations			0
the structure is built on layers of soil that dissolve or erode in water			0
the @entity156 said the dam was " constructed on a very poor foundation " that was n't designed for the conditions			0
seepage has plagued the structure since the reservoir behind it was filled , according to a @entity2 government report in 2007 , and sinkholes have appeared near the structure , suggesting problems beneath the surface			0
during the @entity2 military occupation of @entity25 , @entity2 authorities spent tens of millions of dollars on short - term repairs on the dam			1
but with the immense structure now in the midst of a conflict zone , it remains unclear if it will get the maintenance it needs anytime soon .			0
