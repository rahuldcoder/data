@entity0 , @entity1 -- lurking among the orchards and misty meadows of @entity5 , @entity1 , is a quiet , green energy revolution			1
many old watermills in south west @entity1 are being used to create local energy			1
the tranquil , rural area is most famous for agriculture -- particularly apples and cider -- and along its many rivers are a series of historic watermills , which were for centuries used to grind corn and other cereals for local farmers			1
but now their waterwheels are being put to a new use : generating clean , green power			1
" the mill was falling into disrepair , " says @entity24 , owner of @entity25 " it had been in the family for over 50 years and i knew i was looking at a wasted resource ; so i decided to do something about it			2
" it was partly altruistic -- we wanted to do our bit to save the planet			2
we also knew that the only way electricity prices could go was up , and it made good business sense as well			2
" @entity24 was n't the only local interested in the new potential of watermills			1
he got together with five others and in 2001 they formed the @entity43 with the help of the local council			2
together they applied for grants to help fund work to convert their @entity49 -- including $ 130,000 from the @entity51 's @entity50			1
so far ten sites in the area have joined the scheme -- installing machinery and clearing and repairing weirs and leaks			2
six mills are already online delivering approximately 164,688 units ( kilowatt hours ) of green electricity each year			1
the power is used locally , with any surplus sold on to the national grid			1
in some cases it is n't the first time mills have been used this way , as many had already generated power historically			2
" from about 1870 through to the @entity73 a lot of mills on @entity1 rivers were used to supply electricity to large country houses , " says @entity24			1
" it was usually a 24 - volt system used to charge up batteries			2
but once the national grid took off , and that got out into all the villages , everything changed and generating your own power worked out more expensive and the mills fell out of use			1
" but now those days are coming back			2
with rising power prices , and a growing awareness of green issues , watermills are becoming increasingly attractive as low carbon community power sources			1
already the @entity5 project is being replicated in nearby @entity92 at sites along the @entity94 , as well as in @entity95 and @entity96 , with other projects setting up around the country , including @entity99 in @entity100			2
@entity101 and @entity102 bought that site in 1993 , hoping to run it as a tourist attraction			0
" when we bought @entity99 it was with the intention of diversifying our farming business , " he says			0
" at one time it housed an historic collection of @entity114 horse drawn vehicles , but visitor numbers had steadily declined and the collection sold			0
" but after having their pig farming business devastated by the foot and mouth crisis in 2001 , the couple hit on the idea of using the mill to generate power			0
" when we thought it through , the idea made a lot of sense , " says @entity102			0
" the turbines were here in situ , we have a powerful water source and we can generate @entity134 per hour per day - enough to supply 100 households			0
we 've had tremendous local support for the project too			0
" the couple received a @entity140 grant of $ 79,000 to help complete the work			1
the major obstacle to more conversions is that high start - up costs can deter potential conversions			0
" it is definitely getting harder , " says @entity24			0
" there are less and less grants available at the moment			0
but that could all change			0
the price of electricity is getting higher all the time			0
we now get about 10 or 12 pence a unit ; we used to get 2 pence			0
you 're looking at under ten years to make a profit -- less if prices keep going up steeply			0
" the real issue is how much of the infrastructure you already have , and how much engineering you need to do ; how much equipment you have to buy			0
" but all @entity51 renewable energy producers were given a boost recently when the @entity140 announced on october 16 that it intended introducing a " feed in tariff " guaranteeing rates for renewably produced electricity			1
the tariff is intended to kick - start the renewable energy sector by paying an above market rate for power that is then slowly reduced year - on - year			1
the @entity51 government hopes it will reward early - adopters and stimulate production			1
when @entity177 did the same thing in 1999 it led to a huge growth in renewable energy production -- they currently have ten times as much wind power as the @entity51 , and 200 times more installed solar energy			1
" @entity184 will probably only ever supply two or three per cent of the nation 's need , " says @entity24			1
" simply because of the finite number of suitable rivers			0
generating power like this is quite a thirsty business and you need a very good flow			0
" but generating power locally increases efficiencies by reducing wastage from transporting electricity long distances , and stimulates regional economies			0
" in the end the economics come down to the size of the river , " says @entity24			0
" some people run small operations that rely on filling up a pond and then releasing when it 's full , but the payback on a small site takes much longer			1
" but whatever the obstacles , @entity24 has no regrets : " it 's all been quite fun , really -- especially when the cheque arrives ! "			2

@entity51 watermills *undergoing* a *renaissance* thanks to appeal of green energy
many *disused* watermills in *southwest* @entity1 now supplying @entity51 's national grid
@entity140 hopes to compete with @entity177 on green energy production
