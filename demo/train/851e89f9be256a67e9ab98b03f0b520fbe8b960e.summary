-- unsanitary conditions at a @entity5 cantaloupe farm 's packing facility are a possible contributing cause of one of the nation 's worst outbreaks of listeria contamination in food , the @entity1 said wednesday			1
meanwhile , a @entity13 official said it is too early to declare the outbreak over , but the number of new cases appeared to be diminishing			1
" the peak in illnesses appears to have occurred from late august until the middle of september , " said dr. @entity18 of the @entity13 , who added that additional monitoring will be needed for at least another two weeks			2
the @entity1 said it was unable to pinpoint the definitive cause of the outbreak , which has been linked to 25 deaths so far			1
an @entity1 letter to @entity28 of @entity29 , @entity5 , however , cited violations in sanitary conditions that must be addressed			0
it said tests showed " widespread contamination throughout your facility and indicates poor sanitary practices in the facility			0
" the agency cited several likely causes of the spread of the listeria monocytogenes bacteria at @entity28			0
the likely causes included packing equipment that " was not easily cleaned and sanitized " and the use of washing and drying equipment for cantaloupe packing as well as other raw agricultural commodities			0
in addition , the agency said in a statement , the facility lacked a " pre-cooling step " to remove field heat from the cantaloupes before cold storage , possibly leading to condensation in the cooling process that promoted growth of the listeria bacteria			1
a letter dated tuesday from the @entity1 to @entity28 cited violations in sanitary conditions			0
the letter said tests at the facility found listeria bacteria contamination			0
" these positive swabs were taken from different locations throughout the washing and packing areas in your facility , all of which were either food contact surfaces or areas adjacent to food contact surfaces , " the letter said			1
" this significant percentage of swabs that tested positive for outbreak strains of @entity82 monocytogenes demonstrates widespread contamination throughout your facility and indicates poor sanitary practices in the facility			1
" according to the letter , the company has 15 days to document steps it has taken to correct the problems			0
the letter also said the company notified the @entity1 on monday that it agreed to inspection by the agency of its growing , packaging , and cold storage operations before it resumes food harvesting , packaging , or processing			1
@entity28 also agreed to correct all objectionable observations noted during said @entity1 inspections , the letter said			0
a total of 123 people in 26 states have been infected by the listeria outbreak , the @entity13 says			1
additionally , a woman who was pregnant at the time of her illness had a miscarriage , the agency said			2
the listeria outbreak is the deadliest food - borne illness outbreak in the @entity115 since 1998			1
groups at high risk for listeria include older adults , people with weakened immune systems and pregnant women			2
@entity28 issued a voluntary recall of its @entity124 brand cantaloupes on september 14			2
the tainted cantaloupes should be off store shelves , the @entity13 has said			1
cantaloupes from @entity28 should be disposed of immediately , even if some of them have been eaten , the agency recommended			2
if consumers are uncertain about the source of a cantaloupe , they are urged to ask their supermarket			0
if the source remains unknown , the fruit should be thrown out			0
refrigerating a cantaloupe will not kill the bacteria , which can grow at low temperatures , and consumers should not try to wash off the bacteria .			0

the outbreak is not over , but new cases are on the decline
at least 123 cases have been *reported* in 26 states ; 25 people have died
the tainted cantaloupes were recalled last month
the outbreak is the deadliest food - borne illness outbreak in the @entity115 since 1998
