@entity0 , @entity1 -- on a research trip in @entity5 , dr. @entity3 watched as physicians performed an emergency cesarean section			1
what happened next stunned her			2
" the lights went out , " @entity3 recalled , " and i said , ' how are they going to finish ? ' " she was even more surprised by the nonchalant response			1
" you did n't even see people reacting because it was something they were so used to , " she said			2
fortunately , @entity3 had a flashlight with her , and the doctors were able to use it to complete the surgery			1
but during that two - week trip in 2008 , she witnessed countless other times when the lives of mothers and babies were at risk simply because of a lack of reliable electricity			1
pregnant women would arrive at the hospital with severe complications , but without adequate light to treat them , procedures had to be compromised or delayed until daylight			2
some women were even turned away			0
" i realized that my skills as an obstetrician - gynecologist were utterly useless ( without ) something as basic as light and electricity , " @entity3 said			1
@entity3 said midwives in @entity5 use all kinds of makeshift lighting when they deliver babies : kerosene lanterns , candles , even cell phones			1
" that 's not adequate light for maternity care , " she said			0
" if somebody is hemorrhaging , if a baby needs resuscitation , you need to have directed light			0
" @entity5 is one of the 10 most dangerous countries in the world for a woman to give birth			1
in 2010 , an estimated 40,000 @entity5 women died in childbirth -- 14 % of all such deaths worldwide , according to the @entity64 and the @entity65			1
meanwhile , the neonatal mortality rate is also one of the worst in the world			0
each year , about 4 % of babies in @entity5 die before reaching 28 days old ; for comparison , the @entity71 rate is only a fraction of this at 0.4 %			1
@entity3 said that in her two weeks in @entity5 , she saw more complications than she had in her entire career in the @entity71			1
" once i witnessed the things that i saw , " she said , " i had to let people know , and i had do something about it			2
" with the help of @entity82 , her husband and a solar energy educator , @entity3 worked to find a solution			1
he drew up designs for a solar electric system to provide a free source of power to the state hospital in northern @entity5 where @entity3 had conducted her research			1
while they raised funds for the project , @entity3 returned to @entity5 with a small kit to help show what the system would be able to do : it had a couple of solar panels inside , some lights and walkie - talkies to improve communication			1
the kit was only meant for demonstration purposes -- a miniature model of the larger system			0
but the surgical technicians saw it as something else			0
" they said : " this is incredible			0
you have to leave this with us			0
... this could help us save lives right now , ' " @entity3 said			1
she did just that , and news of the kit soon spread to other clinics			0
so each time @entity3 would return to @entity122 , she came with one or two new " solar suitcases " assembled by her husband			1
today , the solar suitcase includes two solar panels that are mounted on a clinic 's roof and connected to high - quality led lights			1
once fully charged , it can provide light for up to 20 hours			0
the kit also contains headlamps , a fetal doppler to monitor a baby 's heart rate and a cell phone charging unit			0
over time , the solar suitcase has become simpler in design			1
" we got to something that was really rugged , simple to use , portable and that we knew would really work in harsh environments , " @entity3 said			1
it also spread to other countries after @entity3 and @entity82 started a nonprofit , @entity146			1
since 2009 , the kits have been helping health - care workers save lives not only in @entity5 but in facilities throughout @entity122 , @entity151 and @entity152			1
for @entity3 , the solar suitcase is only part of a bigger mission to improve maternal health care and lower mortality rates in developing countries			1
according to the @entity64 , about 800 women die every day from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth			2
and 99 % of all maternal deaths occur in developing countries			1
" i really want a world where women can deliver safely and with dignity , and women do n't have to fear an event that we consider a joy in this country			0
to see birth associated with death and fear is an outrage , " @entity3 said			1
" before i went to @entity122 , i knew women were dying at high rates			0
i just did n't know they were run - of - the - mill things we can take care of			0
" in 2009 , @entity183 completed the solar electric installation that her husband originally designed for the state hospital			1
over the next year , the hospital reported that the death rate for women had decreased 70 %			0
nurses told @entity3 they could see what they were doing , they did n't have to turn women away , and they had blood for transfusions because the electricity provided power for a blood bank refrigerator			1
" when we saw the impact , that gave me the impetus to provide this fundamental thing for people to do the job they knew how to do , " @entity3 said			2
@entity183 provides its solar suitcase , along with training and installation , to hospitals and clinics for free			2
each solar suitcase costs $ 1,500 , which the nonprofit funds through grants and support from partner organizations and sponsors			2
@entity3 also works with its partners in various countries to identify clinics in need and help engage the community			1
" we often ask them to be involved participating in research studies , giving us feedback and making a commitment to maintain these and to replace parts as they 're needed , " @entity3 said			2
so far , @entity229 has provided nearly 400 solar suitcases to facilities in 27 countries			2
they 're being used in main hospitals as backup systems and in rural clinics as a primary source of electricity			2
" it 's just shifted the morale of the health - care worker , " @entity3 said			2
" they 're now excited to come to work			0
... mothers are now eager to come to the clinics			0
" @entity246 , a midwife at a rural clinic in landlocked @entity248 in southern @entity122 , used to use light from her cell phone when treating patients at night			0
she said the solar electric kit she received from @entity3 last month " keeps me going			1
" " this light ... is going to bring good changes , " she said			0
" we should not lose any women			0
i will be able to give good deliveries			0
suturing will not be a problem for me			0
resuscitation of a baby during the night will not be a problem , because of the light			0
" ultimately , @entity3 hopes her efforts will be part of a movement that makes a dent in a very big problem			2
" we did n't set out to transform maternal health care around the world , but it feels like this has grown to something so much bigger than i had ever imagined , " she said			0
" communities are celebrating the fact that they have light			0
and that they now have one more component to help with safe motherhood			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity183 website at @entity284 and see how to help			0
@entity2 's @entity285 contributed to this report .			0

in some countries , a lack of reliable electricity is to blame for deaths during childbirth
dr. @entity3 witnessed this tragic truth during a trip to @entity5 five years *ago*
she and her husband are now delivering a solution : solar energy in a suitcase
