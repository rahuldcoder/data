a jury found the governor had named @entity8 to a state regulatory board in exchange for $ 500,000 in campaign donations			1
after years of litigation , the justices in an unsigned order allowed the criminal convictions to stand			1
the specific question was whether a campaign contribution can constitute bribery if the contribution was not made in " explicit " exchange for a promise of an official act			2
lawyers for the defendants said it can not in their failed appeal to the high court			0
the @entity34 said the men acted with " corrupt intent , " and that the onetime @entity38 governor and an aide tried to hide the campaign cash in a secret bank account			0
the governor had begun a campaign in 1999 to set up a state lottery , and soon after named the powerful ceo to @entity5 's @entity45			2

@entity4 was released four years ago on bail , pending appeal			0
related " honest services " fraud charges were eventually tossed out after the @entity9 , in a separate case , narrowed the scope of the law , concluding the prosecution tactic was being misused as a " catch - all ' statute , added to an indictment when evidence of serious criminal conduct may have been thin			0
dozens of top business and government leaders had been accused of improperly withholding their " honest services " from constituents and shareholders , a violation of federal law dealing with fiduciary responsibilities			0
the high court had allowed the unrelated conviction of @entity90 exec @entity89 to stand , but limited when " honest services " charges could be used against business executives and politicians			0
the current @entity8 / @entity4 appeals were based solely on the related public corruption convictions			1
