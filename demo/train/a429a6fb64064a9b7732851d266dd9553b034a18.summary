what started with days of traffic jams in an obscure @entity3 town has now become a major scandal for one of the most prominent @entity7 politicians			1
for those of you west of the @entity10 , or just with normal lives , here 's how the closure of two lanes on a bridge over the @entity16 suddenly became the epicenter of @entity7 political news			1
governor who ? @entity21 is seen as a rising star in the @entity23 and a possible presidential contender in 2016			1
he won a second term as governor of @entity27 - leaning @entity3 , the 11th - largest @entity7 state , in november			2
he was the keynote speaker at the party 's 2012 convention , serves as chairman of the @entity31 and led all other potential @entity23 contenders in a recent @entity35 / @entity34 poll			2
fast facts - who is @entity21 ? so what happened on the bridge ? back in september , two months before @entity21 's re-election , the @entity40 and @entity3 closed two of the three lanes that lead to the @entity44 in @entity45 , across the @entity16 from @entity46			1
that caused days of massive traffic jams in @entity45 , where the @entity27 mayor had declined to endorse @entity21			1
the closures were ordered by @entity51 , a @entity21 confidante and the governor 's appointee to the @entity40 , which operates the nation 's busiest bridge			1
they immediately sparked speculation by @entity27 that the action amounted to political retaliation against @entity45 mayor @entity60			2
that led to hearings in @entity3 's state legislature and the december resignations of @entity51 -- who had said the closures were part of a traffic study -- and @entity69 , @entity3 's top @entity40 official			1
then came wednesday 's revelation that a top @entity21 aide had e-mailed @entity51 before the closures , telling him , " time for some traffic problems in @entity45			1
" in a lengthy news conference thursday , @entity21 announced he had fired the author of that e-mail , deputy chief of staff @entity78 , and said he was " embarrassed and humiliated " by the " abject stupidity " of the move			0
on the @entity44 : ' those days ... worse than a disaster ' politics ai n't beanbag			0
what 's the big deal ? @entity45 's emergency medical services chief warned at the time that the resulting traffic jams could have life - or - death implications for residents by delaying firefighters and paramedics			1
he listed several examples , including car wrecks , chest pains and a 91 - year - old woman who suffered a heart attack and later died			0
and politically , several analysts say the scandal endangers any national ambitions @entity21 may have			2
" if a woman died here , he 's in deep , deep trouble , " said @entity101 , a @entity35 senior political analyst			0
the former federal prosecutor 's combative personality has produced some compelling video clips over the past few years , particularly when confronted with hecklers			0
critics call him a bully -- an allegation @entity21 denied in his news conference thursday , but one @entity101 said the @entity45 scandal reinforces			1
" there 's something about this that 's so petty and so vindictive ... he 's going to have to find some way to defuse this to prove he does n't run a shop like that , " @entity101 said			0
bridge controversy : traffic snarl delayed @entity126 , official says now what ? investigations and some " soul searching " on the part of the governor , who said he was " blindsided " by the e-mails			1
" i have worked for the last 12 years in public life developing a reputation for honesty and directness and blunt talk , one that i think is well - deserved , " he said			0
" but , you know , when something like this happens , it is appropriate for you to question yourself			0
and certainly i am , and i am soul searching on this			1
" but first , he headed to @entity45 for a mea culpa -- a personal , " face - to - face " apology to @entity60 and the people of his town thursday afternoon , which @entity60 called " gracious " and " conciliatory			2
" that may not be the end of it , however			0
state lawmakers are still holding hearings into the bridge scandal			0
@entity51 refused to testify before the state @entity159 's @entity158 on thursday afternoon , invoking his @entity161 right against self - incrimination			0
and the @entity7 attorney 's office in @entity165 -- the governor 's old post -- says it 's looking into whether any federal laws were broken			0
both the @entity40 's inspector - general and state sen. @entity171 , @entity21 's opponent in november , have asked federal authorities to step in			2
opinion : @entity21 's rising star now a target			0

@entity3 gov. @entity21 is seen as a leading @entity23 contender in 2016
he 's now *ensnared* in a scandal over the closure of bridge lanes in @entity45
" time for some traffic problems " after town 's mayor would n't back @entity21 , an aide wrote
@entity3 governor promises " soul searching " after firing the aide
