as @entity5 reels from protest to protest , for many @entity5 it has never been more important to get message out about why they are on the streets -- to each other , to the media , to any opposing side			1
the country has been rocked in recent days by protesters demanding the resignation of former president @entity15 , with demonstrations at times threatening to spiral out of control as the pro- and anti-government sides clash violently , at times fatally , over the country 's young democracy			1
the protests are the latest to wrack the country in what has proved a dramatic , often bloody , two years since the country 's 2011 revolution ousted former president @entity28			1
@entity15 was elected in @entity5 's first democratic elections a year later , but since then critics say he has become increasingly authoritarian , while the country 's economy continues to falter			1
this crisis has led to many of his supporters amongst the poor and middle class to become disaffected , analysts say			2
who is @entity5 's president @entity15 ? those opposed to @entity15 are a broad group , from youth groups and political coalitions to average citizens and @entity28 loyalists keen to return to power			1
@entity0 spoke to four @entity47 protesters about why they were on the streets , what they are demanding , and where they see their country heading			1
scores of @entity5 have contacted @entity0 through @entity52 -- overwhelmingly representing the @entity47 faction			1
their responses ranged from excitement , to trepidation , to optimism			2
but all shared one determination -- change for @entity5			1
here 's what they had to say , in their own words			2
the veteran @entity65 has documented the streets of @entity67 since the early days of the country 's 2011 revolution			1
he is 23 and a petroleum engineer and photographer			2
i protest because i have a dream of changing @entity5 for the better			1
i think this country deserves better than this			2
nothing has changed since the beginning of the revolution			2
dramatic photos , videos from @entity52 capture @entity5 's crisis i 've seen many people of my age and social background falling during our fight for freedom			1
i still remember carrying them and having their blood on my hands			2
i do n't want their blood to go in vain			2
when i stand beside thousands of people and we chant together , i feel free and strong			2
i 've never had the chance to experience such feelings before the revolution			2
the feeling that you 're not alone makes you feel stronger			0
[ at present ] the atmosphere of uncertainty makes me nervous			0
not knowing how things will turn out makes me worry			0
i 'm excited to see millions on the streets , but i have fears and concerns regarding the role of the military in the coming period			1
we suffered under military rule in the period following @entity28 's resignation , and i do n't want to experience that again			0
the documenter @entity116 lives in @entity67 and works in finance , as well as working as a photographer who has captured images of the protests			1
the main reason that i am protesting -- this time -- is that the @entity123 and @entity15 are not being inclusive			0
@entity15 was appointing minsters and lead figures in the government that are exclusively from the @entity123 [ @entity128 movement backing @entity15 that has risen to power since the fall of @entity28 ]			0
opinion : why @entity15 deserves a chance in addition , he could not restore law and order during the first year of presidency , not to mention his weak economic reforms that every @entity5 is currently facing			1
another personal reason for protesting is how religion is being used and manipulated by the @entity123 in a country where there is a huge illiteracy rate			0
such misuse of religion is allowing the exploitation of the population in terms of wealth , human rights and women 's participation in the work force			0
taking part in a protest feels like someone is getting back an ownership of [ their ] country			1
i believe that @entity5 are evolving politically very quickly , and they will not give up unless their demands are met			1
i 'm excited to see @entity5 going through an @entity162 state , failing and evolving very quickly to refuse such a state , [ but ] i 'm nervous to see what is next			1
the optimist @entity166 is an architect who lives in @entity67			0
my family and i are out in the streets for the same reason we protested against the old regime -- the only difference this time is the ruling party is much , much worse			1
who are the protesters ? [ @entity180 is ] one of the best feelings you can [ have ] ... you finally feel that @entity5 is with you			1
you feel you are not alone ; you get back the feeling of being proud to be @entity5			1
everybody in the marches is very happy , it 's like we already won the battle			0
we will stay in the streets until he resigns or the military force [ @entity15 ] to resign			1
i hope all political parties get united in the [ transitional ] period until we have a real president and government			2
i 'm just optimistic , happy , proud ... and a little worried about the @entity123 's reaction but confident [ we ] will win			0
the first timer @entity196 is 25 and a software engineer who lives in @entity198			0
he went out in the streets for the first time on june 30 amid the mass protests against @entity15 's government			1
during the fuel crisis that started about a week ago , i witnessed long lines of cars waiting to get some fuel			0
people fought each other for a place in the lines			0
every day the crisis is growing , and no action has been taken			0
@entity213 : @entity5 's experiment with democracy this event led me to imagine what will happen when more crises happen			1
the next one could be a food crisis -- and this time , more people will die and the whole country could collapse because of those successive crises			0
the current @entity123 [ government ] does not have any idea how to rule the country correctly			0
they ca n't manage the basic human needs like electricity and fuel			0
the economy is collapsing and not a single action [ has been ] taken to prevent or fix the situation			0
i am considered one of the high middle - class people with high education and a respectable job			0
i do n't face most of the problems people suffer , [ so ] it 's amazing to share the experience [ of protesting ] with your country 's people			0
we all want @entity15 to step down and the @entity123 party to leave the political scene , for now			0
who will rule next is a debate between people , whether it 's the army or the liberals			0
but , for sure , we want a firm grip to save the country and the economy .			0

massive demonstrations against and in favor of the @entity5 president have hit streets
@entity0 has received scores of @entity260 from @entity5 documenting the protests
@entity263 tell why they protest , what they want , and what they think will happen next
