@entity0 was wary of " @entity1			1
" sure , @entity2 was a successful advertising pitchman and in - demand comedian			1
but for all his success , he had n't had a hit prime - time television show since " @entity7 " in the ' 60s			0
" @entity1 , " starring @entity2 as doctor and family man @entity10 , premiered 30 years ago this week , on thursday , september 20 , 1984			1
it was expected to be a strong second to @entity13 ' hit " @entity14 " instead , it became a phenomenon : the no. 1 show in television five years running , the program that turned @entity2 into @entity2			1
its effects were n't limited to its star			0
thursdays became @entity23 's biggest night , with " @entity2 " leading a murderers ' row of @entity0 shows including " cheers , " " @entity26 " and " @entity27 " -- and eventually " @entity28 , " " @entity29 , " " friends " and " er. " @entity0 , after spending the late ' 70s and early ' 80s as television 's lowest - rated network , vaulted into the no. 1 spot and held it , on and off , for two decades			1
the sitcom genre , which had fallen on hard times , was recharged			0
you can draw a direct line from " @entity1 " to " @entity40 , " " @entity41 " and " @entity42			1
" and some observers have even credited the show , with its upscale , photogenic black family , with smoothing the way for another @entity49 - @entity48 family to rise -- all the way to the @entity51			0
" before @entity53 , there was @entity2 , " headlined a story in the @entity55 in describing the " @entity56			1
" but @entity2 was a trailblazer long before " @entity1 " came along			1
as " @entity2 : his @entity60 , " a new biography by @entity62 -- a former @entity64 editor and @entity66 executive -- points out , the man has been a cultural influence since the early 1960s			1
" one of the things that i wanted to do in this book is remind people of all the different ways in which he was a pioneer , " @entity62 said in a phone interview			0
" because ' @entity1 ' was such an overwhelming success , there are people who forget that he was a pioneer in so many ways before ' @entity1			1
' " indeed , the man contains multitudes : comedian , actor , philanthropist , activist			1
he is more than he seems , his rise and success paralleling decades in the life of @entity48			0
call it " @entity89 of @entity2			1
" ' @entity1 ' : our 10 favorite moments 1			1
the standup comedian in some ways , much of @entity2 's persona was fully formed from the first moment he took the stage in @entity98 's @entity97 in the summer of 1962			1
the poor kid from @entity100 grew up listening to his grandfather tell @entity103 stories and his mother share the tales of @entity106			0
@entity2 , also informed by a love of jazz , became a champion storyteller , focusing not on the rat - a - tat - tat of jokemeisters but on the deeply @entity48 rhythms of tale spinners			1
" i do n't think it was an accident that the first routine he really became famous for was about the @entity103 -- the ' @entity116 ' routine , " says @entity62			0
the multimedia superstar for all of @entity2 's early success as a comedian , he entered a whole new realm of stardom when he was selected as one of the stars of an @entity0 espionage drama , " @entity7			1
" he was the first black actor to star in a dramatic role on a network tv show , becoming " television 's @entity130 , " in @entity129 's words			1
" @entity7 " was no sure thing			0
@entity2 had help from producer @entity134 , who stood up for his raw star when @entity0 got nervous , and co-star @entity136 , who refused to make an issue of race			2
in an era when there were few crossover stars , @entity2 was a phenomenon			2
he won three emmys for his performances in " @entity7			0
" his comedy albums , including " @entity146 " and " @entity147 , " were best - sellers			0
he had plans for improving educational outreach ( a personal passion ) and he established a model for black stars to come			0
dr. @entity154 @entity2 had many achievements after " @entity7 " ended its run			2
on the personal side , he went back to school and earned a doctorate in education from the @entity163 , @entity164			0
( the subject of his dissertation : the role of another @entity2 tv series , " @entity170 and the @entity171 , " as a teaching aid			2
) he also became tv 's foremost advertising pitchman , making commercials for @entity174 and @entity175			0
" the three most believable personalities are @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity2 , " said a @entity177 executive			1
everybody 's dad @entity2 's popularity as an advertiser helped lay the groundwork for his return to network television , but first he had to remake himself as a comedian			1
his ' 60s routines often revolved around childhood , but by the early ' 80s @entity2 was a 40 - something father of five			2
his new routines looked at family relationships from a parent 's point of view			0
if this made him seem out of touch to comedians who preferred the brashness of @entity199 -- @entity200 did a wicked @entity2 parody on " @entity202 " -- a concert film , " @entity2 : himself , " showed he still had the touch			2
though it failed in theaters , endless runs on @entity208 earned @entity2 a whole new group of admirers			2
" as good as ' @entity199 : @entity217 ' is , the @entity2 thing , as a piece of standup , i think , is even better , " comedian and producer @entity211 told @entity213 in 2013			1
" i do n't think there was a better one before it , and i do n't think there 's been a better one since			0
@entity223 ! and then came " @entity1			2
" aside from the boost it gave both @entity2 and @entity0 , the sitcom was notable in other ways			1
it took advantage of its hit status to showcase a number of notable black entertainers , including @entity234 , @entity235 and @entity236			2
in fact , the @entity236 episode , which featured the keyboardist using a synthesizer to record and manipulate audio , later inspired hip - hop artists to make sampling a part of their mix. the @entity247 home in @entity248 also featured paintings by black artists -- an extension of a love of art by @entity2 and his wife , @entity254 -- and even made colorful sweaters a thing			1
( yes , @entity2 was well aware that not all the sweaters were attractive			2
) 30 years later , the @entity2 sweater still rules the show was sometimes criticized for presenting a sanitized view of the black family -- one that seemed oblivious to the issues of being black in @entity48 -- but @entity62 says that , too , was deliberate			1
" @entity2 was very aware of the power of television , " says @entity62			2
" ( when ) coming into your living room to 35 and 40 million people a week , presenting a positive image -- not only to white viewers but to black viewers -- was deeply powerful and healthy			0
touched by tragedy " @entity1 " went off the air in 1992			2
@entity2 's devotion to education paid particular dividends in the post- " @entity2 " age			1
a " @entity2 " spinoff , " @entity285 , " " created an explosion in applications , enrollment and graduation rates at black colleges , " wrote @entity278 's @entity277			1
@entity2 himself donated to many schools , most notably a $ 20 million bequest to @entity290 's @entity289			1
but the ' 90s also gave @entity2 some of his most difficult challenges			2
a woman named @entity294 claimed that she was his daughter and demanded $ 40 million			0
he admitted an affair with @entity294 's mother , but denied paternity and @entity294 later served time for extortion			0
@entity2 also suffered the loss of his son , @entity300 , who was killed in an attempted robbery			2
the actor coped with the loss of his son by establishing a scholarship in @entity300 ' name and routinely wearing a sweatshirt with " @entity308 " -- @entity300 ' greeting -- at concerts			0
the wise elder in the 21st century , @entity2 has attracted more attention for his statements about the need for @entity49 to take responsibility for their lives			0
for that , he was depicted as a curmudgeon and a conservative , taking heat from such black writers as @entity322 and @entity323 , though @entity323 , in particular , later changed his view			0
but @entity62 says that @entity2 is simply stressing a philosophy he 's had all along , one that emphasizes education , social organizations and personal responsibility			1
the writer believes that in the time that he has left , @entity2 is trying to be a positive role model , donating money to schools , meeting with children , and showing up at churches			0
" you may disagree with his message , but he puts his money and his time where his mouth is , " @entity62 says			0
and @entity2 has n't slowed			0
at 77 , he maintains a steady concert schedule and he has a new tv series in the works			0
but 30 years after " @entity1 " premiered , @entity2 's legacy , says the author , will be his ability to bring people together			1
" he was the entertainer who helped black people and white people -- but beyond that , all people -- see that they had more in common than they had differences , " says @entity62			0
" he got them all to laugh together , and it 's really hard to be angry at people when you 're in the same room all laughing at the same thing			0
