the role : @entity2 in " @entity13 " who let it get away : @entity16 despite being @entity2 producer @entity18 's best man , @entity16 said , " i do n't " to the offer , and @entity1 got the role instead			1
of course , many studio executives objected to the decision , and even @entity2 creator @entity23 said @entity1 " was n't exactly what i had in mind			0
" @entity26 : low by the 1960s , @entity16 already had a spectacular film career			0
if he 'd accepted the role ( as @entity18 later revealed ) , it would 've been just a one - movie deal			0
@entity0 : name that 007 tune 2			0
the role : neo in " @entity9 " who let it get away : @entity6 turned it down to star in the forgettable action flick " @entity39 , " and the part went to @entity3			1

' at that point i was n't smart enough as an actor to let the movie be -- whereas @entity3 was			0
the role : @entity46 in " @entity47 " who let it get away : @entity50 , who was stuck in lengthy rehearsals for " @entity52			1
" @entity53 got the role instead and , almost overnight , transformed from a @entity55 has - been into one of the most bankable stars in the business			2
@entity26 : high @entity50 called " @entity52 " a " big waste of time			0
" @entity0 : @entity60 , the director he kidnapped , and the awful @entity63 film they made together 4			0
the role : @entity65 in the " @entity66 " trilogy who let it get away : @entity1 , who 'd never read the @entity71 series and claimed he " did n't understand the script			1
" ( can you say karma ? ) @entity26 : high in return for playing the role , @entity75 offered the @entity79 actor up to 15 percent of worldwide box office receipts , which would have earned @entity81 more than any actor had ever been paid for a single role -- as much as $ 400 million			1
the roles : sundance in " @entity87 , " @entity88 in " @entity89 , " and captain @entity90 in " @entity85 " who let them get away : @entity93 @entity26 : tragically high @entity93 turned down the role of @entity86 simply because costar @entity95 refused to give him top billing			1

and finally , in 1978 , @entity93 told " @entity85 " director @entity105 to shove off when he was offered the lead			1
@entity93 's non-negotiable asking price was $ 3 million ; plus , he did n't feel like spending four months shooting in the @entity109 jungle			1
