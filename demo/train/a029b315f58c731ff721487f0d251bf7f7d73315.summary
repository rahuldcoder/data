-- it was a case of like father like son for @entity5 winner @entity4 , who followed in the footsteps of his famous parent on sunday			1
the 26 - year - old @entity9 driver is the third son of a @entity11 racer to win a race -- achieving the feat 30 years after his father @entity15 claimed his first checkered flag at the @entity17			1
they joined @entity21 's @entity20 and @entity19 and @entity23 's @entity22 and @entity24 as the only father and son duos to triumph in the 62 - year history of the sport			1
@entity4 is hoping to build on his long - awaited first victory after heading off @entity32 's @entity31 and @entity33 in @entity34			2
" it 's amazing to have it , " the @entity35 said in a video blog on the team 's website after his 111th race as an @entity11 driver			1
" it 's been a long time waiting and @entity44 ( three - time world champion ) said that the first win is the most difficult			2
after that it gets easier			0
so if that 's the way it goes that would be fantastic			0
" only four drivers in @entity11 history have waited longer to claim victory : @entity31 ( 113 ) , @entity55 ( 117 ) , @entity56 ( 124 ) and @entity57 ( 131 )			0
he still has some catching up to do to his @entity59 father , who won the 1982 world title with @entity61 as he collected five race wins in a nine - season career from 1978 to 1986			1
for @entity4 , sunday 's win was a cause of celebration with @entity15			1
but the @entity67 and @entity68 were sadly never able to enjoy the feat together , as both fathers died in tragic circumstances			0
@entity21 's @entity19 made history in 1996 when he won the world title with @entity61 to add to those @entity20 took home in 1962 and 1968 , making them the only father and son to both be drivers ' champions			2
@entity19 won 22 races in an eight - season career spanning from 1992 to 1999 , but @entity20 never saw him race as he died in 1975 when the plane he was flying crashed in foggy conditions in @entity85			0
his son was just 15 at the time			0
@entity87 earned the nickname " mr. @entity89 " after winning on the @entity91 circuit five times out of his career total of 15 victories			0
@entity22 was also never there to see his son @entity96 win the 1997 world championships with @entity61 , triumphing in 11 races overall in a 10 - season career spanning 1996 to 2006			2
a charismatic and thrilling driver , @entity22 died in 1982 during a qualifying session at the @entity102 @entity17 -- having been runner - up in the world championship three years earlier with @entity105			1
he won six races overall , the first in his home grand prix in 1978 at the @entity111 circuit now named after him .			0

@entity4 wins @entity5 , 30 years after father @entity15 won @entity17
he is the third son of an @entity11 driver to win a race , following the @entity67 and @entity118
win is @entity4 's 111th race , hopefully *paving* the way for more victories
@entity4 's @entity59 father was able to celebrate his win , *unlike* @entity127 and @entity22
