editor 's note : below is an excerpt from @entity5 's new novel " @entity6			1
@entity5 anchors " @entity5 " on @entity8 nightly at 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. et. @entity8 's @entity5 makes her fiction debut with " @entity6			1
what was it ? something ... some detail was wrong			1
. he could n't just leave the body lying there like that			1
it was biting at him			1
he 'd tried to go , walking back to his car in the dark twice now , but the nagging in his brain would n't let him leave until she was absolutely perfect			1
he looked at her lying there in the moonlight			1
her dead body was absolutely stunning			1
before , when she had been alive , sitting in the passenger seat of his car , talking and talking about her life and herself and her journey from @entity35 , @entity36 , to @entity37 to break into acting , he thought his head would blow up like a bomb			1
she just would n't shut up			1
what did she think it was ... a date ? she was a hooker			1
he spotted her climbing the steep steps out of the @entity46 subway station downtown			1
she got straight into his car with a big smile when he offered her a ride			1
once inside , driving , he kept looking away from the road , stealing glances at her neck			1
something about it drew him			1
maybe the shape , the curve -- or maybe it was the soft hollow spot at the bottom			1
it was the only thing about her he could stomach			1
watch @entity5 talk about her new novel » he lowered the automatic windows so her conversation would fly out into the night and he would n't have to hear it			1
her teeth and lips revolted him			1
the shiny pink lip gloss she was wearing had thickened in spots across her lips and some had smeared onto her front teeth			2
looking over at her as she talked , @entity71 thought it was the most disgusting thing he had ever seen			2
back to the task at hand			2
what was it ? it was maddening ... he could n't bring himself to leave until everything was just right ... perfect , in fact			2
like a delicate soufflé or performing his specialty , decorating with boiling - hot spun sugar , perfection was achieved only by acute attention to detail			2
there , in the dark of the clearing , it hit him			2
turning , he walked to his car and reached through the open window into the glove compartment and got it			2
it was his favorite brand -- it was actually the only twine he would ever consider using -- just shipped in from @entity102			1
he had posed her on her back			2
the four bright - red puncture marks torn into her mid-back did n't bother him at all			2
in fact , the dark red against the white skin created a vivid contrast that was somehow pleasing to him			2
walking back to her body , which he had spread carefully on a bed of soft grass to more suitably frame her pale limbs in a night lit only by the moon , he paused again			2
he needed the perfect spot			0
he could n't rush this or he would n't sleep all night			0
the wrist ? like a bracelet ? no. she was wearing a tacky , gold - tone watch			0
that would ruin the whole thing for him			0
and he could n't bring himself to actually touch the timepiece she wore there on her right wrist			0
it looked cheap ; he was sure the gold - tone finish was turning dark at the edges of the band			0
the neck ? no. it was much too close to the lip gloss			0
the gloss had a faint , fruity odor , foul as gasoline fumes to @entity71 , and that alone made him want to retch			0
it would totally destroy the twine 's effect			1
sometime during their " date , " fresh , damp dirt and a little grass had smeared horizontally across her mouth and worked its way up into her nose			1
that was a beautiful and poetic touch of nature , but the lip gloss ... disgusting			0
as he stood there at the foot of her body , staring into her face , her own eyes stared away from him and straight up into the sky , her lips still slightly parted just as they had been in life ... just as they had been at the zenith , that incredibly beautiful and intimate moment when she exhaled her last breath into the night			0
and as he relived that moment , it came to him in an epiphany			0
he decided ... the left ring finger			0
he squatted down and gently picked up her left hand			0
the wrist was still limp			0
he tied a single , perfect bow around her ring finger just before rigor set in ... before the body went stiff and cold and hard			0
he placed the hand back gently across her stomach			0
backing away a few feet to take in the whole picture , finally , he could relax			0
finally , he could get some sleep			0
the bow was perfectly symmetrical , and there , in the moonlight , it was just gorgeous			0
almost like a wedding band			0
