the first time my husband took me to @entity2 , where he grew up and his family still lives , i was skeptical			1
my knowledge of the place did n't extend much beyond @entity6 and hula , and it all sounded a little kitschy for my taste			2
but after five days of seeing his version of the island -- hidden beaches , hikes that opened up to impossibly blue water , and a whole new genre of food -- i was so in love that we moved there a few months later			1
we 're back on the mainland these days , but we return to visit his parents regularly , and we always head off on the same route : an elongated circle around the @entity26 that takes us to our favorite haunts in quick and beautiful succession			0
day 1 8 a.m. of the 4.6 million annual visitors to @entity2 , most stay in hotels along two - mile - long @entity31			1
while everyone else sleeps off their piña coladas , insiders know to snap up the 50 ¢ - an - hour parking meters along @entity36 , just past @entity37 ( garages closer to the resorts can run $ 3.50 for 30 minutes )			1
from there , it 's a five - minute walk to @entity42 , where the long , gentle , early morning waves are a perfect introduction to surfing			1
11 a.m. pho to - @entity46 looks exactly like all the other @entity48 restaurants lining @entity49 -- harsh lighting , @entity52 tabletops , metal chairs -- but the pho is the best of the bunch ( 1007 river st. , 808/533 - 4549 , pho from $ 6 )			1
the broth is rich without being heavy , and the @entity60 basil tastes like it was picked within the hour			0
arrive before noon to beat the locals			0
@entity62 : find out which @entity63 is right for you noon @entity67 's formerly seedy @entity66 has recently come into its own			1
the main drag of @entity69 is now home to places like @entity72 , an eclectic gallery and boutique ( 1160 @entity75 , chinatownboardroom.com )			0
one - of - a - kind surfboards have been designed by local legends such as board shaper @entity78			1
1 p.m. there are two mistakes mainlanders make when talking about shave ice : one , they add a " d " to " shave " ; and two , they describe it as a snow cone			0
do n't give yourself away			0
at its best , shave ice is so fine that it blends seamlessly with the syrup poured on it , making the concoction almost creamy			0
no one does it better than @entity96 , buried in a tangle of @entity31 backstreets ( 2135 waiola st. , 808/949 - 2269 , shave ice from $ 2.25 )			1
owner @entity99 created -- and patented -- his shaving machine , and more than 40 syrups are concocted in - house , in flavors ranging from standard mango to unexpected melona , a honeydew flavor			1
2 p.m. ten minutes north of @entity67 's bustling @entity36 , the noise fades away and high - rises are replaced by 1920s bungalows			1
you 're now in @entity111 , which gets 150 inches of rain a year			0
the ideal way to soak up the scenery is to hike the mile - long path up to the 100 - foot - tall @entity116 ; the trail , framed by bamboo , winds under a rain - forest canopy ( @entity120 , parking $ 5 )			1
6 p.m. while most of @entity31 's sunset - watching spots feel either stiflingly formal or cringingly cheesy , the @entity122 at the @entity123 hits a kitschy sweet spot , thanks to hula dancers and live , lilting @entity128 music ( 2259 @entity129 , royal - hawaiian.com , mai tai from $ 10 )			1
the coral - colored hotel , known as the @entity132 , opened in 1927 and , despite undergoing a total renovation last year , still has an old - school authenticity			1
@entity62 : read about some uncharted islands overnight @entity136 , a group of eight newly renovated properties , are a welcome departure amid @entity31 's pricey mega resorts and aging skyscrapers			0
each has its own identity and is walking distance to the beach			0
@entity146 , for example , plays retro surf films like 1966 's @entity148 in the lobby ( 866/406 - 2782 , @entity150 , from $ 79 )			1
day 2 9 a.m. the island 's scenery changes dramatically -- and fast -- when you head east out of @entity31 on @entity154 , the main road along the eastern ( windward ) coast			1
the 761 - foot - high volcanic crater known as @entity159 immediately rises in front of you , and beyond that , the @entity163 -- style landscape makes even the most articulate person utter embarrassingly inane statements like " amazing ! " and " wow ! " the two - mile - long trail to @entity168 calls for its own set of exclamations ( @entity171 , trail # 6 )			1
perched at the edge of a cliff , the lighthouse is bordered by steep ridges covered in jungly vegetation			0
noon @entity154 breezes past farms , ranches , and the occasional house			0
the lack of development is refreshing -- until you need a cold drink			0
that 's exactly what gave @entity187 and @entity188 the idea to open @entity190 ( 6 ) , a little shop with slow - smoked barbecue , fish tacos , and smoothies ( 41 - 1025 @entity195 , @entity196 , tacos $ 8 )			1
1 p.m. you can look out on 75 - degree , turquoise water for only so long without desperately needing to dive in			1
it 's worth holding out for @entity201 , about five miles north of @entity202			0
while the beaches leading up to @entity205 have thinner strips of sand and strong tides , here the sand is broad and wide , and the water is calm enough for kids			2
rent a double kayak from @entity212 and paddle out to the @entity213 -- known as the @entity214 -- a pair of mini mountains about 1.5 miles off the beach ( 130 @entity218 , @entity219 , half - day rentals from $ 49 )			1
dinner as soon as you hit the town of @entity226 , @entity222 shrimp trucks ( oversize vans ) line the road			0
an under - the - radar favorite is @entity231 's @entity230 , about half a mile north of @entity226 ( 56 - 781 @entity232 , @entity233 , dishes from $ 10 )			2
the shrimp is harvested every morning , and there are nine variations , but the only two worth ordering are butter garlic and spicy garlic			0
beware : this is messy business : your hands will be covered with garlicky butter by the time you 're finished			0
do n't be shy about using the big outdoor sink to wash off			0
overnight @entity246 of the 11 units at @entity248 comes equipped with a full kitchen and a barbecue , and teak chairs and benches are spread out on the grounds , set right on the beach ( 59 - 579 @entity255 , @entity256 , from $ 145 )			2
day 3 11 a.m. the hikes along the coastline get all the acclaim , but a landlocked trail in the middle of the island is worth its own hype			2
the @entity264 in @entity265 covers more than four and a half miles of terrain			0
take in views of @entity271 , the @entity272 , @entity159 crater , and , if you squint hard enough on a clear day , a bit of @entity67 ( @entity268 , park # 8 )			2
lunch do n't be fooled by the tired - looking façade at the @entity277 ; it houses some of the best food on the island			2
@entity281 's @entity280 serves 60 versions of saimin , a noodle soup unique to @entity63 , with @entity285 , @entity286 , and @entity288 influences ( 98 - 020 @entity232 , saimin from $ 4 )			1
and it 's definitely worth stopping by @entity292 's @entity291 to stock up on dried and preserved fruits flavored with li hing , a sweet - salty seasoning ( 98 - 040 @entity232 , 808/488 - 0505 , dried fruit from $ 1.50 )			2
airport detour @entity300 , on a marina off a gravel road three miles from the airport , is one of the area 's last standing authentic tiki bars ( 50 @entity305 , 808/848 - 2800 , cocktails from $ 3.50 )			2
the 52 - year - old spot has a refreshing grit amid its polished neighbors			2
and the decor -- some original , some donated by tiki casualties -- is traditional all the way : blowfish lamps , wooden posts carved with threatening faces , and fishing nets draped from the ceiling			0
