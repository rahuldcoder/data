-- doctors frequently tell patients that they have to lose weight			1
but the majority of them do n't know how it feels to be overweight or what it really takes to lose weight			1
between my 17th and 19th birthday , i went from overweight teenager to lean adult by losing 99 pounds			1
i was a happy teenager from a loving family			2
@entity13 never served as a substitute for happiness in my life , and i had no reason for comfort eating			2
my mother did n't like fast food and always cooked healthy meals			1
knowing that , it seems absurd that i weighed 264 pounds at 16			1
the reason for my weight gain was simple : i loved food ( i still do ! ) , i ate way too much , and i hated exercise			1
well , that 's not totally true			0
my friends and i were passionate soccer players -- sometimes i would even start sweating when my @entity31 game got too exciting			0
" if i do n't eat greasy fast - food , stay away from sweet soft drinks and avoid candies , i wo n't get fat , " i used to think			1
so while my brother was having two potatoes , i ate four			0
he would have enjoyed a glass of milk in the morning if i had n't already emptied the whole liter			0
he loved bread with some bacon ; i preferred a lot of bacon with some bread			0
if you eat more calories than your body needs you will gain weight			1
it 's as simple as that			0
we are constantly told to focus on what we 're eating , and yet we forget to think about how much we are eating			0
of course , i got bullied for being overweight			0
when you 're fat , you 're a target			0
i struggled with the teasing in the beginning but got used to it very quickly			0
that was dangerous -- getting used to people picking on your size means you 're accustomed to being that size so there is no need for change			0
i would still be extremely obese right now if it was n't for a school trip to @entity66 in 2005			1
i like @entity68 food and had a lot of it			1
but on the trip i got food poisoning and lost 7 pounds			1
those 7 pounds were the spark that started the fire			1
i realized that sometimes you have to rsvp yes when life sends you an invitation for change			0
at first i thought : " cool , i lost 7 pounds			1
i will try not to regain that weight			1
" then i remembered there was something called exercise , and that experts said it could help you lose weight			2
so i started using my mother 's elliptical machine			2
i worked out for 15 to 20 minutes every single day			1
i also tried to eat half of what i had eaten before			0
instead of four potatoes i ate two ; instead of drinking a whole bottle of milk , i would only drink half of it			0
my body responded well : within two years i had lost 99 pounds			1
( if i had known i would eventually be writing a weight loss story for @entity0 , i would have gone for 100 )			1
i realized that if you and your body are hungry for change , weight loss can be fun , instead of a burden			1
luckily , i 've never encountered the dreaded yo - yo effect			0
i have maintained my slimmer figure for seven years now			1
after you 've come so far , you do n't want to take a risk and regain the weight because of laziness			2
i purposefully gained 22 pounds working out in the gym because i wanted to build muscle			2
now my 6 - foot 4 - inch frame weighs 187 pounds			2
my body mass index is 22			0
there are countless books on how to lose weight			2
all the authors seem to have priceless pieces of advice they 've skillfully converted into cash			0
but in the end , i believe losing weight is a simple trade : you feed your body the right amount of food and exercise			1
in return , your body burns fat			0
even your wallet gets a little lighter because you have to buy new clothes			0
after seven years of medical education , i have learned a lot about the health dangers of being overweight			2
i 'm glad i took life 's invitation to change as a teen			0
as a doctor who has been where they are , i hope to help others who are struggling with their weight do the same .			2
