-- pinning down a prophet is lonely work			0
just ask @entity3 , @entity4 , investigator @entity5			1
@entity5 investigates the @entity6 as an investigator for the @entity3 prosecutor 's office in @entity4			1
the plain - spoken @entity10 ' sole focus since october 2004 has been to pursue @entity11 and his polygamist sect in @entity13 , @entity4 , a town on the state line across from @entity15 , @entity16			1
he has n't gotten a lot of help from the locals , including the police , whose loyalties have been called into question			2
a state oversight board has stripped six members of @entity13 's tiny police force of their badges since 2003 -- all members of @entity11 ' @entity6 church			1
some were decertified for having plural wifes and others for failing to help catch @entity11 when he was a fugitive , according to @entity33			1
read townsfolk turn their backs on @entity5 when he tries to talk to them , and most of those who do talk are evasive , says the former police officer			1
" there is nobody that works in this city , that works for this city , that is not a loyal @entity6 member , and that 's from the mayor all the way through the employees right down to the last marshal here , and the last police officer that works here is loyal to @entity11 , " @entity5 told @entity0			1
" it 's my experience ... that these police officers are not real police officers			1
they 're enforcers for the @entity6 church			1
they 're enforcers for @entity11 , " he said in another interview			1
" i know that if it comes down to it , i ca n't count on them at all for backup , " he said			0
" in fact , i believe that if guns started being pointed , that their guns would probably be pointed at me			0
" the @entity6 is the @entity6 , the polygamous sect that @entity11 runs			1
the @entity6 , now with perhaps 10,000 adherents , broke away from the @entity74 church more than a century ago when the latter disavowed polygamy			1
it was @entity5 ' investigation that led to @entity11 ' arrest on charges including being an accomplice to rape			1
the charges stem from @entity11 ' alleged practice of arranging marriages between adult male followers and underage brides			1
closing arguments are set friday in @entity11 ' trial across the state line in @entity91 , @entity16			2
the @entity6 leader also faces similar charges in @entity4			1
so far , @entity5 has steered clear of the @entity16 trial			2
but his investigation is ongoing			0
ever since his office was burglarized , the investigator always carries his files with him , he told @entity99 , which is part of @entity0 's parent company , @entity101			2
@entity5 ' work might be lonely , but he 's rarely alone			1
he says he is followed by young men in vehicles with tinted windows every time he shows up in the sect 's stronghold			1
" sometimes if they 're stopped at a stop sign or something , they 'll try to take off real fast , throwing gravel on my vehicle , " he told @entity0			0
" or the diesels , you know , they 'll accelerate real fast , blowing a lot of black smoke out			0
" but he has never let the surveillance and the glares stop him			0
he is on a mission			0
" i think , eventually , justice will win out , " he told @entity0 shortly after @entity11 ' arrest			2
" if i did n't , i could n't continue to do this			0
so we just keep pushing and pushing , and -- and see where it leads us			0
i 'm not -- i 'm not done yet			0
i 'm not ready to give up			2
" he elaborated in a 2005 interview with @entity128			0
" i would just love to see this whole community brought back into the @entity130 , where everybody has equal rights , " he said			0
" these people do n't have the right to voice their opinion			0
they do n't have the right to criticize , " he told @entity128			0
" if they do , then they stand to lose their house , they stand to lose their family , and they stand to lose their job , and most important to most of these people , they stand to lose their salvation			0
" @entity5 said he 's not necessarily interested in stopping the practice of polygamy , according to @entity99			1
" when i first got here , it was still a shock , " he told @entity99			0
" i do n't even think about it anymore			0
there are some families up there where polygamy works for them , and some [ where ] it does n't			0
but i think it has to be done among consenting adults			0
" that 's why prosecutions in the case have focused on statutory rape charges			2
the case has been built by comparing dates on marriage and birth certificates to identify girls who became pregnant by older men before the girls were 16 , too young for sex under @entity4 law			1
" if they get them young enough and get a couple of children , then it makes it very difficult for them to leave , " he told @entity0			2
" and the fact that the women are not educated or taught how to deal or take care of themselves in the outside world is another issue			2
" he doubts change will come quickly to this corner of the desert , even if @entity11 is convicted			2
" i think that there are the die - hards that will always consider him the prophet , " @entity5 said			1
" there are those that are probably questioning it right now			0
" he said he 'll be satisfied if the trial lets women in the @entity6 know they have other choices			1
" i hope that it will empower some of the women there who may be thinking about wanting to get out , to go ahead and get out			2
" e-mail to a friend @entity0 's @entity203 contributed to this report .			0
