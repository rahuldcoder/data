-- a satellite whose orbit is degrading is likely to crash back to @entity5 on friday , and 26 pieces have a good chance of surviving the heat of re-entry , @entity1 said			1
despite being pretty sure that the @entity10 , or @entity10 , will re-enter the atmosphere sometime friday afternoon , @entity13 time , @entity1 says there is no way to know where it will fall			1
because the satellite travels thousands of miles in a matter of minutes , even minutes before re-entry , it will be impossible to pinpoint an exact location , @entity21 of @entity1 's @entity23 team said wednesday			1
on top of that , he said , " part of the problem is the spacecraft is tumbling in unpredictable ways and it is very difficult to very precisely pinpoint where it 's coming down even right before the re-entry			0
" @entity1 says most of the six - ton spacecraft is made of aluminum , which has a relatively low melting temperature and will burn up on re-entry			1
but about half a ton of material is likely to make it through			0
" there are some pieces that are made of stainless steel and titanium and beryllium that have very high melting temperatures , and those pieces will survive , " @entity21 said			2
he said @entity1 has identified 26 pieces , ranging from tens of pounds to a few hundred pounds , that could make it			2
because water covers about 70 percent of the @entity5 's surface , @entity1 believes most , if not all the debris that survives will land in an ocean or sea			0
and even if pieces strike dry land , there 's very little risk any will hit people			0
objects this size re-enter the @entity5 's atmosphere about once a year , according to @entity1			0
this is the largest @entity1 satellite to re-enter in about 30 years , but at six tons , it 's only a fraction of the size of the 75 - ton @entity65 that fell back to @entity5 in 1979			1
portions of it hit @entity68 .			0

re-entry of the atmospheric *research* satellite is likely to come friday afternoon , @entity1 says
most of the satellite will burn up during re-entry , it says
there is little chance that the pieces that survive will hit anyone , it adds
