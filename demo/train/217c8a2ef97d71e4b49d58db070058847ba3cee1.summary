-- as @entity2 rushes ahead with its nuclear program , some foreign policy thinkers urge @entity4 to accept that it must live with " incomplete " security			1
on monday morning , 200,000 @entity4 children spent the morning in bomb shelters rather than classrooms , as rockets from @entity11 barraged southern @entity4 cities			1
that would seem to qualify as security " incomplete " enough to satisfy anybody			0
@entity4 has met the barrage with a new defense system , named @entity18			1
its computers assess which rockets are headed toward populated areas , then it fires missiles to intercept the incoming rockets			1
according to the @entity26 , @entity18 has achieved a success rate of more than 90 % when fired			1
since friday , @entity29 militants have fired more than 170 rockets at @entity4 cities , but as yet , no @entity4 civilians have been killed			1
since 2001 , @entity4 has responded to attacks by deploying ever - more effective technological systems : first the security fence to halt the entry of suicide bombers ; now @entity18 to stop short - range rockets ; and in time , the @entity40 anti-ballistic missile system against longer - range missiles			1
these innovations have defeated and deterred violence and saved many lives			0
but these innovations are also subject to inherent weaknesses			0
the rockets launched from @entity11 are armed only with explosives and shrapnel			2
when @entity18 misses -- and it does sometimes miss -- the @entity11 rockets kill and maim only within a very limited radius			1
the fence also fails sometimes			0
last year for example , a @entity54 citizen was killed and 50 people wounded by a bombing near the @entity59 convention center			0
yet as with the @entity11 rockets , the lethality of bombings is inherently limited			2
@entity4 does not need to reach 100 % success to defeat the terrorism threat			2
suppose , however , that the rockets carried nuclear payloads , or that suicide bombers had access to radioactive materials			0
then a 90 % success rate would not nearly suffice			0
@entity2 's nuclear program threatens to upend the strategic calculus of the past decade , to overwhelm all @entity4 countermeasures to protect @entity4 's population			1
a nuclearized @entity2 does not imply " incomplete " security for @entity4			1
it would expose @entity4 to absolute insecurity			0
as rockets fly toward southern @entity4 , the rest of @entity4 carries on			2
the economy produces and thrives			0
a relative of mine , visiting @entity59 , comments that if she were not reading about the rockets in the newspapers , she would not know they were being fired			0
yet even the threat of a mass - casualty event would paralyze the @entity4 economy			1
people would avoid downtowns , visitors would stay home , children would be sent abroad , investment flows would cease			0
@entity2 would not have to shoot at @entity4			2
it would just have to talk loosely about shooting at @entity4 to do vast harm			0
@entity18 represents a triumph of @entity4 science , generously supported by @entity98 aid under both presidents @entity99 and @entity100			2
but we remain far away from a high - tech shield against the @entity2 threat			2
this week 's congratulations to @entity4 must be tempered by awareness : the biggest danger -- @entity2 's potential ability to build a weapon that could kill hundreds of thousands in a single strike -- looms as menacing as ever			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity112 .			0

@entity4 *reported* 90 - plus *percent* success in *fending* off incoming rockets
@entity112 says the " @entity18 " system is useful for de*fending* against @entity11 militants
he says an @entity2 nuclear weapon would *change* the calculation
@entity124 : *partial* security is *n't* enough when the threat is mass *annihilation*
