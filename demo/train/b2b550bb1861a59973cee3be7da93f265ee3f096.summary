-- " @entity5 " is at the head of the class in more ways than one			1
the fright flick not only debuted at no. 1 on the weekend before @entity8 , it also became the first movie based on a board game to top the weekend box office			1
admittedly , that 's not a huge category : the only other real examples are 2012 's " battleship , " which was swamped by the " @entity17 " tsunami , and 1985 's " clue			0
" ( the games " @entity22 " and " @entity24 " were both based on the books / movies , not the other way around			0
) after a stretch in which critical acclaim and box office success went hand in hand -- think " @entity29 , " " @entity30 " and " @entity31 " -- this weekend brought a reminder that audiences often ignore movie reviews			1
critics hated " @entity5 , " giving it a rancid 10 % rating on @entity38			1
but late october proved to be a perfect time for a horror film about teens using the spirit board to contact a dear departed friend and summoning something much darker instead			0
" @entity5 " had no problem defeating the weekend 's other new wide release , " @entity48			1
" the @entity50 action flick received much better reviews but did n't appeal to as wide an audience			1
@entity50 plays a retired hitman ( are n't they all ? ) who ventures back into the underworld to set things right			2
among returning films , " @entity30 " is slipping the least from weekend to weekend			2
the highly praised drama starring @entity61 and @entity62 is up to $ 124 million , and in a period of rapid box office turnover , it 's the oldest film in the top 10 : four whole weekends in release			1
the biggest leap up the chart belonged to " @entity70 , " starring @entity71			0
success in limited release does n't always continue when a movie opens wider , but that 's what happened here : after two weekends in a handful of theaters , the indie comedy co-starring @entity78 and @entity79 expanded nationwide and pulled in $ 8.1 million , nearly cracking the top five			1
domestic weekend box office estimates from @entity85 ( final numbers available monday afternoon ) : 1			0
" @entity5 " -- $ 20 million 2			2
" @entity48 " -- $ 14.2 million 3			2
" @entity29 " -- $ 13 million ( $ 46.1 million total ) 4			0
" @entity30 " -- $ 11 million ( $ 124.1 million total ) 5			0
" @entity89 " -- $ 9.8 million ( $ 29.9 million total )			0

" @entity5 " debuted at @entity92
it 's the first movie based on a board game to reach top
" @entity30 " is still in the top five four weeks into its release
@entity50 ' new movie " @entity48 " was in second spot
