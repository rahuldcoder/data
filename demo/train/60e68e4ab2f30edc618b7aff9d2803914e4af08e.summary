@entity0 -- to hear @entity2 explain it , there 's just one way to cope with becoming the @entity7 ' favorite man to hate : " i gave fear up for @entity8 this year , " @entity2 told @entity1 during an extensive interview			1
and he 's not kidding			2
it 's probably a good idea , given the fact that @entity2 's budget -- passed nearly unanimously by @entity13 -- has become the @entity15 @entity14			1
it includes entitlement cuts , most notably the gradual shifting of @entity19 into a program dominated by private insurers			0
it 's no surprise , then , that @entity7 call it dangerous , mean and reckless -- and that 's not all			1
" the @entity2 road map is the way to the cliff and then over the cliff , " said rep. @entity25			1
" the @entity2 proposal would destroy our government , " economist and @entity36 professor @entity35 declared at a @entity38 event			1
" there 's a big test to this country and whether we apply our country 's principles -- you know liberty , free enterprise , self - determination , government by the consent of the governed -- all of these really core principles are being tested right now , " @entity2 told @entity1			1
" you ca n't have fear if you try to fix these problems			0
" the 41 - year - old @entity2 has been on a fast track			1
first elected to @entity59 in 1998 after a stint as a congressional staffer and adviser at the conservative think tank @entity63 , the @entity57 , @entity58 , native ran for the @entity13 at the ripe old age of 28			1
it was a long shot , but he won , convincingly			0
always a fiscal conservative , @entity2 made his mark delving into the nuance of federal budgets			1
now he 's become famous as the face of a new brand of @entity15 economics -- one that includes the most sweeping plan to cut government spending in decades and enact major entitlement reforms			1
as evidence of his growing influence in the party , the @entity77 on friday tapped @entity2 to be its @entity82 chairman to lead its fundraising effort against president @entity84			1
@entity2 had the deficit in his sights for years			1
at first , even @entity15 steered clear of some of his more controversial budget ideas like @entity19 reform			2
but then the economy went south and the tea party became the rage			0
suddenly , the push to slash budget deficits became popular			2
so popular , in fact , that @entity2 's budget outline overwhelmingly passed the @entity15 - controlled @entity13 in the spring			1
it cuts $ 6.2 trillion over 10 years in federal government spending			0
that 's big bucks , and @entity2 does it by gradually transforming @entity19 into a program in which recipients receive vouchers to help buy private insurance			1
he also gradually raises the program 's eligibility age and transforms @entity108 into a block grant program			2
on the tax side , the @entity2 plan includes major tax reform that reduces the top rate for both individuals and corporations			1
the plan died in the @entity117 and handed the @entity7 a political issue			1
" ... his budget would kill people			2
no question , " @entity122 and @entity124 - inning economist @entity123 told @entity1			2
" the cuts in @entity19 he 's proposing , the replacement of @entity19 by a voucher system would in the end mean that tens of millions of @entity131 would not be able to afford essential health care			2
so that counts as cruelty to me			0
" @entity2 scoffs at the criticism			1
" there 's sort of a shoot - the - messenger strategy these days , " he added			1
" i 'm the messenger , and you ca n't fear that if you are who you are			2
" it 's a pattern for @entity2 , who has grown in popularity by pushing the unpopular , a fairly unconventional route			1
not only has he proposed major reforms in entitlements ; he 's also tried to end his colleagues ' pork projects			2
when he became chairman of the @entity150 this year after @entity15 captured control of the @entity13 , he continued to touch the untouchable -- the third rail of @entity131 politics			1
" i used to say i 'm like a koala bear grabbing on			0
so here 's the problem : if you do n't address these issues now , they 're going to steamroll us as a country , and the issue the more you delay fixing these problems , the much uglier the solutions are going to be , " he told @entity1			2
" fifty - one percent of @entity19 right now is funded with borrowed money , and so if we 're going to keep the promise , you have to change it for our generation			2
you have to change it for those of us in the @entity171 that wo n't have a program when we retire			0
" it 's become the mantra of the @entity15 , including presidential candidates			0
so when former house speaker @entity178 criticized @entity2 's plan as " right - wing social engineering , " in a television appearance in may , it created an immediate furor			1
@entity183 was forced to take the comments back			0
he called @entity185 within days to say he was wrong and misspoke , according to @entity2			1
the other @entity15 candidates have supported his ideas -- although with some nuances , because the notion of changing entitlements is a controversial proposition for a presidential candidate			0
@entity195 gov. @entity194 , who has not backed away from his comments calling @entity197 a " @entity198 , " said he and @entity185 talked recently about the program and the need to reform it			0
speaking at an @entity203 event , @entity194 said he told @entity185 , " ' hank you for having the courage to stand up and being , talking about this , ' and i said , ' i am proud to join you in this discussion with @entity131 for clearly calling the @entity197 program that we have in place today broken			0
' " last week on @entity212 's radio show , @entity2 said he did n't think the program is a criminal enterprise but is operating like a ponzi scheme			1
" it 's a pay - as - you - go system where earlier investors , or , say , taxpayers , get a positive rate of return ... and later investors , or taxpayers , get a negative rate of return , " he said , according to a partial transcript			1
" and so ... that is how those schemes work			0
the point is , unless you fix this problem , it 's going to get much worse			0
" and how would @entity2 make @entity197 financially sustainable ? by gradually raising the eligibility age , tying the benefits for more wealthy recipients to inflation and offering workers under the age of 55 the option of investing some of their taxes into personal retirement accounts			1
say what you will about @entity2 's willingness to take on sacrificial lambs , he is not shy about pushing controversial proposals -- and that 's a rarity in @entity0			1
" he is a guy without guile , without pretense			0
he likes to hang out with actuaries for relaxation , " conservative commentator and @entity1 analyst @entity249 said in an interview			0
@entity2 worked for @entity249 at @entity63			2
and there 's more to @entity2 than the @entity0 wonk			1
he 's also a hunter who can target elk with a bow and arrow			0
and he 's an exercise buff -- when in @entity0 , he works out each morning with some of his congressional colleagues using a grueling fitness routine called @entity262			0
one favorite pastime : trekking the @entity264			0
his devotion to fitness was spurred by the early death of his father at age 55 when @entity2 was 16			2
" i basically had to learn to sink and swim , " he recalled			0
" i did a lot of growing up very fast			0
and it made me take stock of who i am , what kind of person i want to be			0
it made me , i would say , very initiative - prone -- live life to its fullest because you never know how long it is going to last			0
" @entity2 was pushed again this summer to run for the @entity15 presidential nomination by assorted @entity15 luminaries			2
his answer : no , not yet			0
" i think there are other good people who can do this job , " he told @entity1			0
" but there are not other good people who can raise my kids			0
" -- @entity1 's @entity290 and @entity291 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 's budget was passed nearly unanimously by @entity13
but @entity7 call the plan dangerous , mean and reckless
@entity2 *shrugs* off the criticism , calling it " a shoot - the - messenger strategy "
