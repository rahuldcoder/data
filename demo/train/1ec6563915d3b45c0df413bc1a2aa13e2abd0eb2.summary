we arrive in the morning at the @entity1 in @entity2 , north - east @entity3 , just a few kilometers away from mountains which outline the border with @entity6			1
the summer heat is already beating down hard and it 's only 9 a.m. but it 's not humidity that hits me as i climb out of the @entity11 , rather the overwhelming smell of dog urine and feces			2
this is a makeshift shelter that should be housing a maximum of 400 dogs			1
instead there are more than 1,700 animals being kept in large concrete pens at the compound			1
staff work around the clock			0
this region is the heartland for the cruel and inhumane dog smuggling trade			0
the illegal operation sees an estimated 200,000 dogs transported in trucks from @entity3 into neighboring @entity6 , across the @entity31 and driven across to @entity32 where the meat is considered a delicacy			1
some believe it has medicinal qualities and acts as an aphrodisiac -- black dogs are apparently the best for sexual dysfunction			1
yet no scientific proof has ever proved such a claim			0
the dogs at this shelter were intercepted more than a month ago after @entity3 authorities stopped several trucks trying to cross the border into @entity6			1
the drivers were arrested but no one was prosecuted			0
their cargo ? thousands of dogs crammed into small steel cages -- at least a dozen dogs to a cage -- where they are left for days on end without food or water , while the smugglers make their week - long journey			1
some of the dogs die from suffocation along the way			1
others endure broken bones and crushed skulls during the trip			0
and they 're all disease ridden			0
these dogs were destined for restaurants in @entity32 where a single dog can be sold on average for $ 60 an animal			1
it 's a lucrative business for smugglers , considering a dog fetches only a few dollars in @entity3			1
@entity79 , founder of the @entity81 - based @entity80 , moved to @entity3 from the @entity82 10 years ago on a mission to help the country 's overwhelming stray dog population			1
the charity , which relies on donations from animal - lovers around the world , set up an immunization program , and just last week neutered its 50,000th dog			1
there are now plans to expand the program nationwide			0
@entity79 says the dogs would have endured an even more horrific ordeal if the truck had n't been intercepted			1
" at best , they could have been clubbed -- maybe unconscious , maybe not -- and had their throats slit in from of other dogs and they all know what 's going on			1
at worst , they 're skinned alive , strung up and beaten ... while alive , set on fire , " he said			0
" it 's a horrendous death and that 's what we 're trying to stop			0
never mind that it 's illegal to do it -- it 's the sheer inhumanity of this trade that this can still be going on in the 21st century			0
" while these dogs did n't end up on dinner plates in @entity32 , they were struck by disease that spread like wildfire through the shelter due to the overcrowding			1
" this place should just be for dogs coming in , to get vaccinated and then to leave and move on to other shelters			1
but they 're all full , if not overflowing , and these dogs desperately need loving homes , " he said			2
the few that are cute , fluffy or pedigrees are swiftly adopted but the majority -- mangy strays and street dogs -- will never leave the concrete floors and wire fencing of the shelter			1
@entity136 , chief of the @entity137 , also knows the challenges in front of him			0
" we still need a lot of funds because we will have to take care of these dogs for a long time before they can find homes -- if they find homes			2
" meters away from the pens that divide the sick dogs and the healthy is a building that houses the critically ill. skin hangs from their frail , skeletal bodies			2
many are covered in sores , while others have mucus dangling from their noses -- often a sign of pneumonia , distemper or canine parvovirus infection			0
last month , disease claimed 780 dogs			2
while we watch the veterinarians try to minimize pain and suffering , a dog takes its final breath and passes away on a stainless steel trolley			2
@entity170 is one of several vets from the @entity82 who have flown to @entity3 , volunteering their time to help local staff try to stop the outbreak			1
the @entity80 that supports the shelter with food , drugs and vaccinations put out an @entity179 last month and the @entity180 , @entity181 and the @entity182 -- organizations based in the @entity184 , @entity82 and the @entity185 -- answered the call for help			1
" it 's heartbreaking being here			0
these dogs are inherently still wanting to trust humans after everything they 've been through , " said @entity170 , as she pulled her stethoscope away from the bony ribcage of the dead dog			2
the challenge facing western veterinarian staff that have flown into assist is the @entity198 religious beliefs of the @entity199 that do n't allow dogs to be euthanized			2
" we do have our hands tied because of religious issues and that 's something that internally we 're conflicted with -- but we need to respect their views , " @entity170 explained			0
@entity207 is a veterinarian nurse based in @entity208 , @entity209 and arrived at the shelter just a few days ago			1
not being able to put a dog out of its misery goes against every bone in her body			0
" it 's heartbreaking because in the western world we would help them on their way			0
but here we can only give palliative care -- make them as comfortable as possible			0
we give them pain relief , with the really skinny ones we give them some cardboard to sleep on and some kind words			0
but that 's the saddest thing -- we ca n't send them on their way			0
" as for the relatively healthy ones , she can only try and remain optimistic that the rescue of these dogs means they have another chance at life			2
" what they need is good treatment , good nutrition and loving homes to go to			0
this must not be the end place for any rescue dog			2
a shelter should not be the end place			1
it 's a huge problem			0
if we could stop the root of the problem , which is the dog eating trade , we could stop this -- all of this			0
" but for now the multi-million dollar dog meat industry continues to thrive in parts of @entity181 , a harsh reality for animals affectionately referred to as " man 's best friend			2
