-- following a @entity0 investigation , the @entity1 released some data on its pediatric heart surgery program , showing a 5.8 % overall mortality rate from 2008 to 2012 , slightly higher than the national average of less than 4 % mortality			1
the data was first requested in december 2012 by a local journalist , and again in january 2013 by the @entity11 attorney general 's office			2
the @entity1 repeatedly declined to release the program 's mortality rate , saying that information would compromise patient privacy laws			1
the newly - released data shows that in 2012 , the year of the program 's suspension , the mortality rate climbed to 7.1 % , according to the @entity1			1
babies die ; hospital halts heart surgeries " anytime a question is raised about a clinical program or a patient 's care , we bring all involved parties together and review the situation and circumstances in a ' no holds barred ' manner , " wrote the @entity1 in a statement last friday			1
" sometimes we even choose to put a program ' on hold , ' until we are certain that we are doing everything necessary to provide the highest level of care			2
this is what we did with our @entity41 program			0
" " the mortality rates ranged from 4.5 percent to 7.1 percent			2
these ranges are comparable to national mortality rates averaging 5.3 percent for programs of similar size to ours , " says the @entity1 statement			1
comparing oneself to programs of a similar size is n't good enough , says @entity51			0
smaller programs often have slightly higher mortality rates than largest programs			1
" these smaller institutions want to go open these programs , but they do n't have all the correct measures to take care of these kids , and then they do n't want to explain , and they end up losing their kids rather than sending them to a bigger facility that 's more rehearsed in this , " says @entity51 , who began a change.org petition asking the hospital to release their mortality outcomes			0
@entity66 : ' mortality is a reality that we face every day ' her son @entity70 was born with a severe heart defect and was originally treated at the @entity1 before transferring to a higher - volume program at the @entity73			1
" before we did n't really know what a real cardiac unit looked like , until we went to @entity76			0
i went there and i was amazed , " @entity51 said in an interview in may			0
