@entity0 -- @entity2 and @entity3 have won praise from privacy proponents for efforts to encrypt their latest smartphones in a way that would prevent law enforcement from accessing certain private data			1
the @entity11 , not so much			2
@entity11 director @entity12 told reporters thursday that the agency is talking to both companies to raise concerns that their privacy efforts could hinder criminal investigations			1
@entity2 last week touted that with release of its latest operating system @entity20 , it no longer could bypass the smartphone user passwords			0
" so it 's not technically feasible for us to respond to government warrants for the extraction of this data from devices in their possession running @entity30 8 , " @entity2 said in a blog post			0
@entity3 quickly followed suit , saying it already had such technology in phones running its android operating system , but that " as part of our next @entity34 release , encryption will be enabled by default out of the box , so you wo n't even have to think about turning it on			1
" @entity12 said that he was " very concerned " that the companies were " marketing something expressly to allow people to place themselves above the law			2
" revelations by former @entity50 contractor @entity48 of government mass surveillance programs has posed problems for @entity54 tech companies , which are required by federal law to cooperate with surveillance program requests			1
concerned that the revelations will damage their businesses , particularly in foreign markets , the companies have taken a more public role in pushing back on the surveillance programs			0
@entity62 , which fought a losing court battle against some surveillance requests , recently won a fight to make public secret court documents detailing that battle			0
the company used the information to tout its efforts to protect the privacy of its customers			2
the @entity11 director said he understood the privacy concerns in the wake of @entity48			1
but he noted that the @entity11 sometimes has an urgent need to access data , such as in cases of kidnappings or terrorism			0
@entity12 said he supports the idea that the @entity11 should have a warrant from a judge to take a look into someone 's closet , or smartphone , but added he could n't support " the notion someone would market a closet that would never be open			0
