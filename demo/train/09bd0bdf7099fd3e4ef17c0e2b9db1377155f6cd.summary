@entity0 , @entity1 -- the new @entity4 arms control agreement with @entity5 calls for the @entity6 to significantly reduce its nuclear stockpile , but critics are rightly asking whether this will leave the @entity6 safe			1
they say the @entity6 must maintain a healthy nuclear deterrent , even as it works toward president @entity11 's goal of a world free of nuclear weapons			1
that leaves questions about the quality of the nuclear weapons the @entity6 will keep in its arsenal , which are aging			1
are they safe ? are they reliable ? and , given that the @entity6 stopped testing nuclear weapons by blowing them up -- both above and below ground -- 18 years ago , how will we know ? those are some of the questions that @entity2 's @entity28 correspondent @entity27 and i sought to answer when we flew to @entity1 for an exclusive tour of the @entity32			1
at @entity0 , it is all about virtual testing			1
scientists actually generate the conditions of a nuclear weapon to analyze the nuclear stockpiles to make sure they are functioning correctly			2
the word " cool " does not begin to describe it			2
first , @entity41 showed us around @entity0 's @entity43 , where he is the operations manager			2
at @entity43 , scientists conduct up to 1,000 explosions a year and heat up explosives to react to thermal changes			0
he walked us into a tank that can blow up 22 pounds of explosives			0
" when and if the president ever has to push that button , we need to know that the weapons will work , " @entity41 said			0
" and as we scale down the nuclear weapons , we are working to make them much safer and much more reliable			1
" @entity55 , who runs the weapons program at @entity0 , explained that high - explosive molecule testing is even more extensive than the traditional testing done before 1992 , when a nuclear test involved blowing up a nuclear weapon			1
" there are hundreds of ways a nuclear device can fail , " @entity55 told us " we catalogue those and we test against them in a non-nuclear fashion			1
and , more importantly , we can do complete three - dimensional simulations of things that you could n't possibly test in the old days			0
" at @entity0 , you can cut the explosives in half by laser without melting or sparking			0
we learned that this means you do n't disturb the atoms inside the high explosive			2
@entity55 said the test vibrates the atoms at a rate of a millionth - billionth of a second , so fast that heat and shock waves ca n't be conducted			0
this removes the atoms one at a time from the high explosive and provides a more accurate reading of the condition of the explosive			0
" we found failure modes in the stockpile that we could never have found with nuclear testing because we 're able to do these massive simulations , " he said			1
" these are the largest calculations that man has ever done			0
" all of these simulations are cataloged on @entity0 's supercomputers , which are some of the fastest in the world			1
@entity95 , the lab 's associate director for computation , showed us around the supercomputer rooms , which he calls the lab 's " crown jewel			1
" there , thousands of computers pull together all of the physics necessary to model a nuclear weapon 's reliability and safety			1
did i mention these computers are fast ? we are talking about a hundred trillion operations per second			0
it is about to get even faster , with a new computer system called the petaflop , which would be able to do about a quintillion operations per second			0
@entity95 said even that is n't fast enough for what the @entity6 needs to do to fix the nuclear weapons as they age			1
we ended our day at @entity0 's @entity117 , where the world 's largest laser generates the temperatures and pressures found only in stars , the sun and in nuclear weapons			1
the equipment looks like a spaceship about to take off			0
this summer , @entity117 will begin experiments that will focus the energy of 192 giant laser beams on a tiny target filled with hydrogen fuel			0
the goal is to obtain fusion energy , which is what powers the sun and stars			0
inside the target chamber , the target that each of the lasers needs to hit is smaller than the diameter of a human hair			2
the director of the @entity117 , @entity141 , showed us a full - scale target , which can fit in his hand			0
inside a little gold can is a red dot the size of a pencil eraser			2
there , @entity141 said , " the isotopes of hydrogen sit ... and get ready to be blown to bits			0
" " we can model parts of physical processes that go on inside a weapon without testing , " @entity141 said			1
" this is the only place in the world where you can get to the nuclear phase of the weapon without blowing up a bomb			2
" in fact , we found that at @entity0 , scientists could learn more about what 's going on inside a nuclear weapon without actually testing it than they can with a nuclear test			1
every night , the control room , modeled on @entity170 's command center , runs a laser experiment using 2,000 computers and 60,000 control points			2
" we 're finally at the point with this laser facility and our computers and with other facilities for the first time to do this kind of thing , " @entity141 said			0
" and i think this is why president @entity11 probably has more confidence -- one of the many reasons he has -- to go forward with this new policy			0

critics wonder : would the new start arms pact with @entity5 leave the @entity6 *vulnerable* ?
at @entity32 , non-nuclear blasts help simulate nuclear ones
virtual testing aims to ensure that @entity6 arms are safe , reliable
at lab , some of world 's fastest supercomputers simulate what happens inside nuke blast
