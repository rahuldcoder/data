@entity0 -- it was supposed to be a week focused on domestic issues to bolster the chances of @entity5 in november midterms			0
president @entity7 wanted to drive down a virtual highway , talk about rebuilding infrastructure while standing in front of a bridge , and otherwise push his proposals to build middle class opportunity -- all rejected so far by @entity15			1
instead , violence erupting in the sky over @entity18 and on the ground in the @entity20 set the agenda			0
on three straight days , @entity7 ended up in front of reporters for previously unscheduled statements on the volatile developments halfway around the world that obscured the planned @entity28 messaging			1
such buffeting by world events adds to a perception driven by @entity7 's critics that he lags behind foreign policy issues instead of getting out front			1
" there is a sense that this @entity28 is being driven by events as opposed to sort of driving its own agenda , " noted @entity1 political analyst and @entity37 reporter @entity36			0
toss in the immigration crisis along the southern border , with tens of thousands of unaccompanied children overwhelming available facilities , and " it adds to a sense that @entity7 is sort of adrift in an out - of - control world , " @entity36 said			1
facing a low approval rating in polls and the possibility of losing control of the @entity54 to @entity15 in november , the @entity28 has tried to focus on an @entity7 staple -- the struggle of everyday @entity57 to get by			2
in recent weeks , the president has shared burgers in @entity60 , sipped beer and shot pool in @entity63 , and munched on @entity65 barbecue to demonstrate his connection to working @entity57			0
@entity68 crisis boils over the past week offered similar opportunities			1
on tuesday , @entity7 tested out a car simulator in @entity71 , @entity60 , and used the occasion to criticize his @entity15 foes			2
" republicans in @entity76 keep blocking or voting down some of the ideas that would have the biggest impact on middle - class and working families , " @entity7 said at the research facility			1
meanwhile , the @entity20 crisis reached a boiling point with mounting violence between @entity84 and @entity85 in @entity68			1
wednesday , he called for meetings on domestic policy issues , but then secretary of state @entity88 came to the @entity28 after returning from @entity89 , @entity90 and the @entity92 nuclear talks in @entity93			0
late in the day , @entity7 announced a new set of economic sanctions against @entity97 banks , energy companies , defense companies and some officials due to the administration 's contention @entity103 has failed to take steps to end the @entity18 conflict			1
no domestic issues came up			0
" i 've repeatedly made it clear that @entity97 must halt the flow of weapons and fighters across the border into @entity18 ; that @entity97 must urge separatists to release their hostages and support a cease - fire ; that @entity97 needs to pursue internationally mediated talks and agree to meaningful monitors on the border , " @entity7 told reporters in the @entity28 briefing room			1
@entity7 also discussed a recount of votes in the @entity90 presidential election , the nuclear negotiations with @entity92 and the collapse of a cease - fire between @entity84 and @entity123			1
@entity18 tragedy upstages infrastructure event thursday was little different			0
@entity7 traveled to @entity129 , @entity130 , for remarks on infrastructure funding , followed by a trip to @entity134 for @entity5 fund - raising events			1
again , a development abroad dominated the focus -- reports from @entity18 of a @entity140 jetliner apparently shot down by a surface - to - air missile , killing all 298 people aboard			0
with images of burning debris on tv screens across the nation , @entity7 started his remarks in @entity130 with a reference to what happened			2
" the world is watching reports of a downed passenger jet near the @entity97 - @entity18 border			2
and it looks like it may be a terrible tragedy , " he said			0
" right now , we 're working to determine whether there were @entity57 citizens on board , " he added , before getting back to creating jobs to help the middle class			1
meanwhile , vice president @entity162 explained why he was late to speak to a class of @entity165 - @entity57 women enrolled in a technology training course in @entity167 : he was on the phone with @entity18 president @entity169 talking about the plane " blown out of the sky			1
" when @entity7 flew to @entity134 that evening on @entity172 , he spoke with @entity169 and prime minister @entity173 of @entity174			2
later he would also talk with @entity176 prime minister @entity175 and @entity88			0
before arriving back in @entity0 late that night , @entity7 also spoke with his national security team and was briefed on the latest efforts to support an investigation into the air disaster			2
friday morning , after meeting with members of his @entity182 , @entity7 again appeared in the @entity28 briefing room to state what many suspected -- the @entity57 believed that the plane was downed by a missile shot from an area of @entity18 controlled by @entity97 - backed rebels			2
" this was a global tragedy , " he said			0
" an @entity192 airliner was destroyed in @entity194 skies , filled with citizens from many countries			0
so there has to be a credible international investigation into what happened			0
" he also said he spoke with @entity84 prime minister @entity201 about the worsening violence and @entity84 's ground invasion of @entity68			1
minutes later , @entity7 got back to his domestic agenda , stopping by the first lady 's " state dinner " for kids who created winning healthy lunch recipes			2
he told the audience how much he loved the event , and rather than having to focus on bloodshed around the world , he described how he loses his mind over a good bowl of chips and guacamole			0
jet downing a ' game - changer ' in world relations with @entity97			0
