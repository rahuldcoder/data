-- " this block used to be full of pretty little houses with well - kept yards			2
" when you spend any time in the newly bankrupt @entity4 , you get very accustomed to hearing the words " used to be			1
" it 's a phrase often uttered by the old - timer looking fly in the red suit and crocodile shoes , who may actually remember when @entity12 was the pinnacle of industry			2
but it 's also said liberally by young men and women who have been hearing about @entity4 's good old days from their parents and grandparents			1
the thing is , when you are in or around @entity4 for awhile , " used to be " seeps into your brain through osmosis -- a simultaneously fuzzy and vivid collective memory that makes the @entity12 the most nostalgic place in @entity24			1
my parents grew up in @entity4 and , like too many others , fled to the suburbs in 1967 after years of lingering racial tension boiled over and riots rocked the city			1
that meant that my sister , brother and i grew up 20 minutes from @entity12 's @entity37 , the border that , like a hammer , separates the current and " ex " @entity12			1
my grandma stayed stubbornly behind on @entity41 on the @entity43 side of @entity4			1
i would visit on weekends and go through the attic , looking for clues of what @entity12 used to be			2
i especially relished the boxes of black and white snapshots of my parents in the 1960s			1
there they were in one shot , sipping cheap @entity54 sparkling wine while throwing a party at @entity56 , their high - rise in @entity58 , a sweet pad that overlooked the @entity61 's brewery			0
in another one of my favorites , they stand with my older brother @entity65 , then 3 years old , in front of @entity67 's , the beloved department store where the elevators had operators and the restaurant served salads with celery seed dressing			0
it was hard not to be curious and a bit envious of this city life that had eluded my siblings and me			2
in high school , my girlfriends and i made pilgrimages past @entity37 every weekend to hang out with the city boys who went to the excellent @entity82			2
they introduced us to @entity84 , a bowling alley that blasted @entity86 and let us drink the @entity87 20/20 we had bought illegally from a liquor store with bulletproof glass			0
the city felt dangerous , but we felt immortal			0
opinion : how @entity4 can rise again i finally got my chance to live in @entity4 in 2010 , when i moved there to make a documentary about the city			1
like many @entity24 , i had caught a whiff of optimism from @entity4 , rumors about newcomers and artists descending on " @entity100 , " news of urban planners and visionaries who had a plan to make it the city of the future			1
so i came with my crew , ready to roll , even an uplifting title in mind : " @entity110			0
" but finding the easy comeback story proved challenging			0
although we did indeed encounter a small gang of young creative types and revitalization efforts inside @entity4 's small @entity117 area , beyond these few blocks of hope we found a citizenry fending entirely for itself			1
the truth is , we encountered an endless parade of grotesquerie in @entity4 : a scary dude named @entity126 , face disfigured from a gunshot , running a depraved strip club out of his deceased parents ' home			1
a young man named @entity134 trying to make it as an @entity137 artist when his house gets shot up by men with @entity140 on @entity141 , his calls to the @entity132 unanswered			0
an old woman , head of a community cleanup group , robbed in her home in broad daylight			0
illegal " scrappers " dismantling an old @entity148 repair shop just to get money for beer			0
an overworked demolition crew , hired by the city , brimming with tales of finding frozen bodies during routine jobs			0
was our truth - telling becoming an exercise in exploitation ? where were the solutions we came for ? it was time to stop asking who may save @entity4 and instead ask @entity12 what compelled them to stay in this dysfunctional place			1
we started with @entity166 , a former schoolteacher who , despite thinning crowds , opens the @entity168 every weekend on a bombed - out block in @entity4			2
he stays because " @entity4 without a black - owned blues club just is n't @entity12 anymore			1
and somebody 's got to do it			0
" along @entity173 , we met @entity174 , who , after 30 years still slogs away at @entity175 22 , trying , often in vain , to keep jobs in the city			0
" the middle class was born right here in @entity4 , " he said			2
and across town , there was @entity183 , who turned down an easy life in @entity185 to run the @entity186			0
" if a city has no cultural institutions , " he said , " then is it still a city at all ? " robocop creator : @entity4 shows film 's fictional future is upon us all these people had one thing in common : a deep sense of duty and unflagging belief that they need to do their part to preserve some of what had made @entity4 a source of great pride for this country			1
with looming slashes to pensions and the threat of more service cutbacks that will come with chapter 9 , i wonder how many loyalists will question their sacrifices ? the subjects of the film , which in the end we called " @entity218 , " could not escape the deep nostalgia that compels them to stick with @entity12			1
this burden of the past haunts even the 20 - something @entity222 , who spends her time off prowling through abandoned buildings , flashlight in one hand and a book about @entity4 's history in the other			1
she 'd climb to the top floors and sit in old kitchens , looking out the giant windows , panes long gone , trying to recall a time when this place was on the rise			0
" it 's weird , " she said one day , looking out at the cityscape			0
" i was n't even here for the good times , but still , i have the memory of this place when it was bangin '			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity244 .			2

@entity244 : people in @entity4 always talk about how pretty , how lively , things used to be
@entity249 grew up in suburbs , but she loved the snapshots of her parents in 1960s @entity4
she wanted to film the " comeback city , " but found desperate people on the margins
@entity249 *decided* to turn camera on the folks who stayed to bring @entity12 back to its *vibrant* past
