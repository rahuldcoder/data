@entity0 -- by the time president @entity4 walked into a packed auditorium at the @entity6 monday , his economic message for the day had already been eclipsed by the unfolding tragedy at the @entity8			1
and that was before the city 's mayor announced that 12 people and the gunman had been shot dead			0
as the @entity6 shifted again into disaster - response mode , the president 's already - full plate got a lot fuller			0
and while the executive branch is more than capable of keeping multiple balls in the air , the topics @entity4 has been looking to push for months are again receding into the background			0
here are five things @entity4 thought he 'd spend his monday doing : 1 -- the financial crisis , five years later on september 15 , 2008 , that financial services giant @entity25 filed for what would become the largest bankruptcy in @entity30 history -- launching an economic spiral that saw the unemployment rate spike , home prices plummet and the auto industry sink into insolvency			1
on monday , the president planned to mark the five - year anniversary of the financial crisis with a robust accounting of his own achievements in bringing the economy back from the brink and to warn congressional @entity43 not to risk another downturn by playing politics with the country 's finances			1
" at the moment , republicans in @entity53 do n't seem to be focused on how to grow the economy and build the middle class , " @entity4 said at his monday event , which was pushed back almost an hour as law enforcement officers flooded the @entity8 in the southeastern part of the city			1
his economic remarks come just weeks before major financial deadlines , including the end of the federal government 's 2013 fiscal year on sept. 30			2
@entity4 must also narrow down his list of potential replacements for @entity62 as chairman of the @entity64 , a list that no longer includes @entity66 , a former adviser who sunday withdrew his name from consideration			0
but the economic message monday came only after @entity4 noted the shooting that had just taken place across town , offering the now - familiar assurances that the perpetrator of the attack would be held responsible			2
" we 're going to be investigating thoroughly what happened , as we do so many of these shootings , sadly , that have happened , and do everything that we can to try to prevent them , " @entity4 said , before moving on to the latest developments in ... 2 -- @entity83			1
the crisis over @entity86 's chemical weapons had occupied the bulk of the president 's time during the past two weeks , but on monday the attack in @entity0 led his morning meetings			1
@entity6 officials said @entity4 was briefed " several times " by his top counterterrorism officials on the unfolding @entity8 situation			1
at the same time , officials at the @entity97 were putting final touches on a long - awaited report that confirmed what many already suspected -- that sarin gas loaded onto rockets was used to kill more than a thousand @entity83 in august			0
the report did n't place blame for the attacks ; that did n't stop @entity4 's national security adviser @entity106 from asserting in a statement the report " reinforces our assessment that these attacks were carried out by the @entity83 regime			1
" while a diplomatic solution hammered out over the weekend between the @entity30 and @entity114 may provide a way to avoid a military strike on @entity83 , the accord is by no means final			0
" we took an important step in that direction towards moving @entity83 's chemical weapons under international control so they can be destroyed , " @entity4 said at his monday event			1
" and we 're not there yet , but if properly implemented , this agreement could end the threat these weapons pose , not only to the @entity83 people but to the world			2
" under the @entity30 - @entity114 plan , @entity86 has a week to provide a list of his chemical weapons , where they 're located and how they were made			1
but experts are n't certain he 'll comply with the demands , leaving open the possibility of @entity30 airstrikes against his regime			0
that 's a possibility @entity4 says he 's ready for -- though lawmakers from both parties have shown no renewed willingness to approve military strikes in the country			2
an @entity4 administration onslaught to persuade senators and congressmen to vote for strikes was met with skepticism last week			0
for @entity53 , the @entity83 debate was a shift from the battle over the government 's finances , which some @entity43 are using to harden their opposition to ... 3 -- @entity157			1
the largest piece of legislation @entity4 can claim -- 2010 's @entity157 -- is only beginning to take effect amid ever - louder cries from @entity43 that it 's bad for patients , doctors and businesses			1
a group of @entity43 lawmakers say they 'll oppose any government funding plan that maintains funding for @entity157 , effectively threatening a government shutdown if the law stays in effect			0
the law 's health care exchanges take effect oct. 1 , and the @entity4 administration has been hurriedly pressing healthy young people to register			2
without them , rates on the exchanges will be higher			0
the rollout of @entity157 has n't always been smooth , a fact @entity4 has said should be expected for a large law that enacts major changes to the health insurance landscape			1
but as the rollout date approaches , polls show that @entity30 are wildly confused about the law 's implications			0
in one survey , many were n't even sure it was still a law			0
@entity4 has deployed a parade of high - profile supporters -- including former president @entity193 -- to help convince @entity30 the law offers them a better deal on health insurance			2
and on monday he noted that " just two weeks from now , millions of @entity30 who 've been locked out of buying health insurance just because they had a pre-existing condition , just because they had been sick or they could n't afford it , they 're finally going to have a chance to buy quality , affordable health care on the private marketplace			0
" and then there 's : 4 -- immigration what seemed like a momentum - fueled bill to overhaul the nation 's immigration system was met with a wall of opposition in the @entity6 over the summer , and debate has n't restarted amid the haggling over government funding and the flurry of briefings on @entity83 's chemical weapons			1
@entity4 has strongly urged lawmakers to take up the reform measure , and he said in an interview that aired sunday the @entity225 bill would pass if it was put up for a vote in the @entity6			2
5 -- floods out @entity227 it 's hurricane season on the @entity229 , but the weather disaster over the weekend was playing out thousands of miles away in the @entity232 , where days of heavy rain caused massive flooding that cut off towns and left at least eight people dead			0
the catastrophe occupied much of the president 's time last week ; on thursday he signed a disaster declaration for @entity241 , and on sunday he told gov. @entity242 in a phone call that he was deploying his emergency management chief to assess the damage .			0

the shooting at the @entity8 led president @entity4 's talk about the economy
@entity4 later touted his achievements since the financial crisis started five years *ago*
@entity4 spent the last few weeks addressing the chemical weapons situation in @entity83
@entity157 's rollout , the *stalled* immigration bill have gotten lost in the shuffle
