-- a @entity2 space probe headed toward its next target sunday after sending back detailed images of an asteroid that scientists hope will increase understanding of how the solar system evolved			1
pictures of the asteroid @entity11 from the @entity14 probe 's deep space fly - by saturday are some of the most detailed ever taken , the @entity9 said			1
the images , taken while the probe raced by at 15 kilometers ( 9 miles ) per second , show a deeply pockmarked , irregular rock -- possibly left over from the birth of the solar system			2
@entity21 with the @entity22 described the asteroid as " a very old object " in a statement saturday			0
" tonight we have seen a remnant of the solar system 's creation , " he said			1
the surface of the asteroid , shaped like a big potato , has deep craters covering its 130 - kilometer length			1
the @entity14 craft came within 3,162 km ( 1,965 miles ) of @entity11 , orbiting just beyond @entity36			2
the probe spent several hours shooting images of the irregular shaped space rock , circling more than 450 million km ( 280 million miles ) out from the sun. the space agency says its @entity43 camera was able to capture detail down to just a few dozen meters			2
the next stop for the @entity14 spacecraft -- named for the stone that helped decipher @entity49 hieroglyphics -- is comet @entity50			0
if all goes according to plan , the probe will intercept the comet in 2014			0
the two will travel in tandem for several months as the comet hurtles from near @entity56 's orbit toward the @entity57 , with @entity14 finally touching down on the surface to take samples			0
