-- federal investigators are concerned a potential danger persists because of the simultaneous use of intersecting runways at @entity5 , one of the nation 's busiest and a gateway to the @entity9 metro area			1
the alert comes after repeated instances in which planes above the @entity5 airport flew too close to each other in violation of safety standards			1
there were four such instances last year and at least four this year , according to the @entity20 @entity22 inspector general			1
in one case , on january 16 , 2008 , two @entity24 planes -- a @entity25 and an @entity26 -- missed each other by 600 feet , according to a @entity22 inspector general 's report			1
" that was very scary			0
i was there for that one personally in the control tower , and it scared the heck out of everybody up there , " said @entity32 , a @entity5 air traffic controller			1
potential danger arises when approaching planes need to abort their landings , which happens about every 700 flights at @entity5 , according to a @entity45 analysis			1
in what the @entity45 calls " go - arounds , " the diverted plane approaching @entity5 has to make a sharp right turn through the flight path of planes landing and taking off from an intersecting runway , allowing little margin for error			2
" there was a distinct possibility that we could have had a collision with these operations , " @entity32 said			0
@entity32 said he raised the safety issue to the @entity45 but got nowhere			2
he persisted , taking his complaint to @entity63 's congressional delegation , which organized two meetings last year with @entity45 officials			0
in response , @entity32 said , he was punished , put on paid leave for 11 months , then leave without pay for a month			0
the @entity45 said the disciplinary actions had nothing to do with @entity32 ' safety complaints			0
@entity32 filed a whistle - blower complaint with the @entity20 @entity73 , the agency that investigates whistle - blower complaints			0
@entity32 ' complaint led @entity22 inspector general @entity76 to investigate			1
@entity76 found merit in @entity32 ' concerns , concluding in a report two months ago that " questions about the safety of the runway @entity84 approach configuration at @entity5 persist			2
" in response , the @entity45 promised to use a computer program that helps air traffic controllers stagger aircraft to ensure proper spacing			1
on november 5 , the @entity22 wrote to the @entity73 confirming the computer system had been put to use at @entity5 on october 26			1
the next day the @entity73 learned the technology was no longer in use at @entity5			0
" i am outraged , " said rep. @entity93 , @entity94			0
" when you put into jeopardy the human lives at risk , it ca n't get any more serious than that			0
" @entity45 spokesperson @entity101 said , " there was no intent to deceive anyone about what we were doing			0
" she added , " @entity45 safety officers wanted to make absolutely sure employees were fully trained on the equipment			0
" the @entity45 said it intends to have the computer system fully operational at @entity5 by mid-december			1
last week the @entity73 raised the matter with president @entity112 , writing that " we found a substantial likelihood that @entity45 officials were engaging in conduct that constitutes gross mismanagement and a substantial and specific danger to public safety			2
" meanwhile , after a year out of the control tower , @entity32 returned to his regular job wednesday at @entity5 air traffic control .			2
