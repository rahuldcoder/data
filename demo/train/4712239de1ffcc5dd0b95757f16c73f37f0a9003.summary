-- apparently it was a coincidence , but the deadly shooting in @entity3 came on the same day that the 17 - year - old @entity5 winner @entity4 was scheduled to speak with high school students and receive honorary @entity8 citizenship			1
instead of listening to @entity4 , instead of seeing prime minister @entity9 honor the idealistic teenager who defied radicals to advocate peace , reconciliation , and education , @entity8 watched in horror as their normally placid capital became the scene of mayhem in what @entity9 later described as a terrorist attack			1
it was the second attack this week , the second in which a @entity8 soldier was killed			0
in both cases the alleged perpetrators were men whose passports authorities had confiscated fearing they had become radicalized and would travel to the @entity26 to join @entity28 extremists			0
the @entity3 attack kept @entity4 from delivering her message in person			1
and yet , there is something profoundly powerful in this intersection -- in this scheduling conflict of competing ideologies			2
the killings in @entity8 and the canceled events delineate a sharp contrast between the alternative worldviews faced by young people today -- particularly by young @entity42			2
they also highlight the need to develop a clear path of active involvement for those who want to join in making a reality of @entity4 's vision , just as those who support extremists receive clear direction on how to join their cause			1
on one side there is the future outlined with such remarkable clarity by @entity4 , one in which we provide educational opportunities for all , strive for peace , and respect our differences			1
she has the heavy burden of having become the torch - bearer for advocates of moderation , coexistence and equality			0
then there is the other end of the spectrum , inhabited by the hyper - extremist group known as @entity74 , which also manages to communicate its vision for the future , broadcasting its ideology , its military exploits and its excesses across social media platforms			2
@entity4 had arrived in @entity80 this week , as scheduled but , sadly , she left town without speaking , after her events were canceled as a result of the crisis in @entity3			1
she tweeted , " i extend my thoughts and prayers to the @entity8 people during this difficult time			0
" it was not the first time that her plans were abruptly changed by a shooter			0
her life took a most unexpected turn in 2012 after an extremist tried to kill her			0
now , with the rise of @entity74 and a jihadist appeal that has brought young @entity42 from around the world to fight in @entity102 and @entity103 , @entity4 's symbolic place in the battle of ideas extends beyond @entity104 and @entity105			1
now it is vital that her message be heard everywhere			2
but she can not do it alone			0
there is a great need to build on her ideas with practical action			0
those who accept the @entity74 creed know what to do			2
they travel to the @entity26 to join their jihad , or they follow @entity74 's deadly guidance at home			1
for those who embrace @entity4 's enlightened view there is no clear path ahead			1
how does a young person join the cause of freedom and equality ? one of the admirable aspects of young adulthood is an awakening to the larger world ; a wish to become involved in something larger than ourselves , a drive to make the world a better place			2
consider @entity4 's words at the @entity140 last year : " we call upon all communities to be tolerant -- to reject prejudice based on cast , creed , sect , religion or gender			1
to ensure freedom and equality for women so that they can flourish			0
we can not all succeed when half of us are held back			0
we call upon our sisters around the world to be brave -- to embrace the strength within themselves and realize their full potential			0
" compare it to the @entity74 appeal , which a few days ago proclaimed the rightness of its revival of slavery and slave markets for selling @entity162 women , or its more recent call to followers , " if you are not able to find an ied or a bullet , then single out the disbelieving @entity168 , @entity169 , or any of their allies			1
smash his head with a rock , or slaughter him with a knife , or run him over with your car , or throw him down from a high place , or choke him , or poison him			0
" the jihadi appeal is quickly rejected by the vast majority of @entity42 , but the tiny percentage who accept it can cause terrible damage			0
and their help contributes to @entity74 victories in the @entity26 that are destroying the lives of men and women , including those who might have grown into future @entity191			2
@entity4 's canceled events in @entity8 will likely be rescheduled			1
when she returns , she will have a message that will resonate even louder after what occurred in @entity3			1
until then , let her supporters come up with a plan so that those who would follow her can help build the world she envisions , with organizations and active movements in which people can enlist to promote equality , coexistence , and acceptance of other points of view .			0

@entity207 : @entity4 was *due* to make *appearances* on day of @entity3 shooting
she says @entity4 has a powerful message of reconciliation and education
@entity215 : it stands in stark contrast to the hateful , violent *rhetoric* @entity74 uses to *recruit*
she says we need to find ways to spread @entity4 's *hopeful* , *healing* message
