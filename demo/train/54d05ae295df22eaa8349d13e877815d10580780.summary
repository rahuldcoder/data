what is tech but yesterday 's dreams realized ? from touchscreen tablets to virtual reality , it all has to start in somebody 's mind before it ends up on the shelves of a store ( or , let 's be honest , in an @entity13 warehouse somewhere in the middle of nowhere )			1
no , we here at @entity16 have n't dreamed up any technological breakthroughs that will change the world			2
at least none that we 're willing to discuss publicly			2
but we do think about tech stuff a lot and ponder how to make it better			1
so as this new year dawns , we came up with these five wishes for the tech world in 2013			1
are they all likely to come true ? almost certainly not			2
but some might , and the others may be useful as conversation starters if nothing else			0
let us know what your tech hopes and dreams for 2013 are in the comments			1
the @entity36 you do n't have to be an @entity38 fanatic to love the @entity39			1
@entity39 , the co-founder of @entity38 who is known more as a gadget geek than a ruthless businessman , showed where his heart is when asked about the constant barrage of lawsuits flying back and forth between tech companies these days			2
@entity39 , who has dropped out of the business end of things at @entity38 , had a solution			0
" i hate it ... " @entity39 said			0
" i wish everybody would just agree to exchange all the patents and everybody can build the best forms they want to use everybody 's technologies			0
" we 're with @entity61			0
if the consumer - tech titans quit squabbling over the details and use all the tools at their disposal to make great products , we as consumers win , right ? but we 're not holding our breath			2
estimated chance : 2 % the perfect social site more than 1 billion of us have made social networking a regular part of our lives			1
so why is everyone so unhappy ? with @entity77 , if it 's not concerns about privacy , it 's irritation at ads or frustration with " friends " who share those stupid " click this or you hate puppies " posts			0
@entity88 's microbursts of news and info , much of it snarky commentary , definitely are n't for everybody			0
( that said , can even the biggest @entity88 haters agree with us that " @entity88 is for twits " is an old , tired , unoriginal insult and move on ? ) so let 's hope for the perfect networking site to come along out of nowhere in 2013			1
failing that , maybe the existing sites will put their differences aside and combine the best of each into a single super-network			0
( @entity105 sure does look pretty			0
but how many folks do you know who use it on purpose ? ) oh ... and our pipe - dream social network will be bankrolled by some billionaire as a public service , so there 'll be no annoying ads or worries about your data being used to serve advertisers			2
hear that , billionaires ? get busy			0
estimated chance : 7 % affordable 3 - d printers ok ... so , " affordable " is one of those things that 's definitely in the eye of the beholder			0
and by some early - adopter standards , the $ 2,200 or so you can plunk down for a @entity130 or other 3 - d printer qualifies as a bargain			0
but we 'd love for 2013 to be the year that these living - in - the - future devices gain enough traction for the inevitable price drop that always eventually comes with new technology			1
( witness : the $ 1,389 vcr ) the potential of @entity142 printers is one of the truly exciting promises of emerging tech. the ability to reproduce tiny parts of bigger , more complicated objects -- say , cameras , appliances , etc. -- could help consumers extend the lifespans of our increasingly disposable gadgets			2
but , let 's be honest			0
we 'd probably use ours to make action figures or dinosaur skulls or a bunch of bad guys from @entity160			1
hurry up with that price drop			0
estimated chance : 46 % made in the @entity163 it 's not just about the goodwill they 'd get from customers , although there would probably be no shortage of that			1
but it 's increasingly looking like good business for top tech companies to start making their products in the @entity163			1
in 2012 , we saw glimmers of hope			2
@entity38 announced that it will begin manufacturing one of its computers in the @entity163 in 2013			1
@entity181 , the @entity182 electronics company , announced it will be opening its first @entity163 factory in @entity184			1
and @entity48 gave " made in the @entity163 " a shot as well , with its ill - fated @entity187 device			1
@entity38 , among other tech firms , has taken some lumps over reports of poor worker conditions on its assembly lines in @entity182			2
now , with production , transportation and other costs in @entity182 increasing , experts say it might not be long before it makes financial sense to move factories back to the @entity163			1
as the @entity163 economy continues to slowly rebound , let 's hope 2013 sees its fair share of that move			1
estimated chance : 50 % battery life we get it			1
we ask our smartphones , tablets and other mobile devices to do more , and do it faster , every year			0
we also want them to be small enough to act as fashion accessories ( even as their display screens get bigger )			0
and we realize that all that surfing , texting , streaming and downloading burns power			0
but is it too much for us to dream of a day when we can go from sunup to sundown without having to stay tethered to a usb port ? a day when we can stream music or videos without growing anxious about preserving the precious remaining drops of juice in our gadgets ? there 's some room for optimism here			2
@entity230 researchers say a new amplifier design they 're working on could double battery life in smartphones			1
research on consumer applications is underway , and , if we 're lucky , it will mean durable , environmentally friendlier batteries that will make finding public spots next to power outlets less of a blood sport			0
estimated chance : we have no idea , but our fingers are crossed			0

as 2012 ends , here are our tech dreams for 2013
will the big guys stop suing and start making the best gadgets possible ?
we 'd love a " perfect " social networking site
more " made in the @entity163 " tech and longer battery life would also rock
