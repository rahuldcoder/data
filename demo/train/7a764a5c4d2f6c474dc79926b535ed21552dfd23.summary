@entity0 , @entity1 -- i came to @entity4 expected to be wowed by lots of shiny new gadgets , but i 'm leaving impressed by the seemingly less sexy subject of mobile operating systems			1
turns out there 's a lot happening here			2
a lot of the buzz was focused around the @entity14 launch on sunday			2
a rival to @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 , it seems unlikely it will get much traction in the @entity21			1
but in places where people have yet to buy a smartphone it might stand a chance -- it 's intended to run on less powerful phones that are cheap to make and sell			2
one of the aspects of the launch that surprised most people was the number of manufacturers and network operators backing the @entity18 tell us : what 's your dream smartphone feature ? that 's a sign of how fed up those parties are getting of being told what to do by @entity41 and @entity42 , and how worried they are that they are being increasingly locked out of the profits of the smartphone sector			1
they are lashing themselves to @entity14 in the hope that it will lead to more money for them down the line			0
also shown off for the first time was @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity55 's alternative to @entity17			0
due later this year , @entity52 has had a long history of false starts , so we were excited to take a look at it			0
it essentially looks a lot like @entity17 , but seemed pretty janky to us and a long way from being ready for release to consumers			0
it was n't the best of debuts for something so important			0
read more : will we ever have battery - free mobiles ? but for me and the rest of the @entity77 team , the star of the show is something very few people will have heard of			1
@entity80 is an operating system for mobiles and tablets coming in october			1
it does n't have the big names attached to it like @entity14 and @entity52 , but it feels a lot slicker to us			0
we have just named it the best of show and we 're hoping that it is something we 'll see in the real world very soon			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity95			1

@entity77 's @entity95 says seemingly less sexy mobile operating systems drew his attention at the @entity4 in @entity0
@entity100 's @entity18 generated some of the biggest buzz but @entity95 thinks it will struggle to gain a major following in developed *countries*
