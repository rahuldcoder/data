-- they have been meeting for two months , poring over concepts and ideas already hashed out by three other groups over the past year			0
but nine days before their deadline , members of the so - called congressional " super committee " created to forge a deficit reduction deal indicated sunday that they remain hung up on basic issues of tax and entitlement reform that have previously stymied agreement			1
@entity14 rep. @entity13 , the panel 's @entity15 co-chair , told @entity0 's " @entity24 " that the only solution possible might be a two - step process in which the bipartisan committee sets a figure for increased tax revenue that congressional committees would then implement through legislation			1
" there could be a two - step process that would hopefully give us pro-growth tax reform , " @entity13 said			0
@entity29 to debt panel : show courage the continued political wrangling over how to reform the tax code and entitlement programs such as @entity35 and @entity36 as part of a broad deficit reduction plan causes consternation for two senators who were part of the " @entity42 " that put together their own plan earlier this year			2
" we 've got to be willing to probably make some folks mad on both ends of the political extreme , " @entity45 sen. @entity44 of @entity46 told the @entity0 program			2
" and you 'll know this super committee is getting close if you hear folks on both ends of the political extreme scream the loudest , because that will show that there 's actually movement being made			0
" " that 's what 's so disappointing , " he added			0
the panel created under the debt ceiling deal earlier this year has until november 23 to reach an agreement on at least $ 1.2 trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade			1
if it works out an agreement , @entity66 must vote on the unamended plan by december 23			2
failure to reach an agreement or gain approval by @entity66 and president @entity72 would trigger $ 1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts scheduled to take effect in 2013			2
@entity13 said sunday that the process will fail unless @entity45 are willing to accept significant reforms to entitlement programs such as @entity35 and @entity36 , the government - run health care systems for the disabled , poor and elderly			2
democrats , meanwhile , say any solution must be balanced with spending cuts , entitlement reforms and increased tax revenue			1
@entity13 and other @entity15 oppose any kind of tax increase , particularly the call by @entity72 and @entity45 to raise rates of wealthy @entity90 to increase their share of the tax burden			1
however , the @entity15 position has shifted to accept increased tax revenue through reforms that would lower rates by expanding the number of payers while ending some subsidies and loopholes			1
" increasing tax revenues could hurt the economy , but within the context of bipartisan negotiations with @entity45 , clearly they are a reality , " @entity13 conceded to @entity0 chief political correspondent @entity100			1
@entity15 have offered a proposal with $ 1.4 trillion in deficit reduction , including $ 500 billion in new revenue from capping individual deductions while cutting all six income tax rates by roughly 20 %			1
under the proposal , the top rate would fall from 35 % to 28 %			0
@entity45 immediately rejected the plan as insufficient , saying it would end up decreasing revenue in the long run by permanently extending tax cuts from the @entity119 administration that are scheduled to expire at the end of 2012			1
the @entity15 proposal would bring in more revenue by spurring economic growth , @entity13 insisted , adding : " we @entity15 want more revenues			1
we just want to raise it by growing the economy			0
" other legislators stuck to long - held positions , showing the remaining gap			0
" the kind of reform we 're talking about is actually guaranteed to create millions of jobs over time and also bring more revenue , " sen. @entity136 , @entity137 , said of the @entity15 proposal on " @entity139			1
" in particular , it would extend @entity119 - era tax cuts set to expire at the end of 2012 , said @entity136 , one of the super committee negotiators			0
that 's the problem , countered rep. @entity145 , the chair of the @entity146 , on @entity148 's " @entity147			0
" " that was not a serious proposal , " she said , insisting that the combination of reducing some itemized deductions while extending the @entity119 tax cuts would result in decreased revenue in the long run			1
on @entity139 , @entity45 rep. @entity156 of @entity157 said he agreed with fellow panelist @entity136 on most of his proposal			1
however , @entity156 called for actual numbers for revenue growth that can be analyzed by the @entity161 instead of assertions of future economic growth that " @entity136 will dream about			0
" " i believe that all of the ingredients for a good resolution are there , " @entity156 said			0
" we just need to develop a will			0
" @entity44 , meanwhile , said on @entity0 that if the super committee fails to push through a compromise , @entity66 should vote on one of plans worked out by either the " @entity42 " or a deficit commission appointed by president @entity72 in 2010 that was headed by former @entity176 sen. @entity175 , a @entity15 , and former white house chief of staff @entity177 , a @entity179			2
both plans pushed by @entity44 call for around $ 4 trillion in deficit reduction by a combination of spending cuts , tax increases and reforms to entitlement programs such as @entity188 , @entity35 and @entity36			2
another deficit commission in 2010 , headed by former @entity178 budget director @entity190 and former @entity192 chairman @entity191 , @entity193 , also called for a comprehensive approach including higher taxes , frozen spending and entitlement reforms			0
a so - called " grand bargain " along those lines discussed by @entity72 and @entity178 speaker @entity203 , @entity204 , earlier this year fell apart over differences on tax hikes on the wealthy sought by @entity45 and @entity35 restructuring sought by @entity15			1
