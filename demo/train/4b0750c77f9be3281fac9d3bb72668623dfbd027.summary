-- @entity2 property and gold -- the two safest places to put your money , or so the saying goes in recent years			2
for the past several years , owners of @entity2 property have watched with delight as the values of their homes have spiked annually well into double digits			0
with gold , as has been the case for thousands of years , it has provided a tradable commodity which investors have turned to in uncertain times			1
it 's a safe haven , the asset of last resort			0
but with quality gold ore becoming increasingly hard to find , a @entity24 company has ventured 125 kilometers ( 78 miles ) into the @entity26 to build @entity28 's largest gold mine			1
otherwise known as a place for tourism and skiing , the town of @entity33 , in the @entity35 region of @entity36 , is an unforgiving environment to run a mining operation			1
average temperatures in winter usually only reach -23 degrees @entity40			0
but that has n't stopped the mining or the growth of the area			0
global demand that growth is possible because global demand for gold is high , said @entity49 , president and ceo of @entity52 - based @entity51 , which runs @entity33 's gold mine			1
" demand is continuing to grow in a part of the world that 's growing population-wise and is growing from a wealth perspective , " said @entity49			1
recent reports from the gold industry development group @entity61 ( @entity61 ) show that consumer demand in @entity63 has skyrocketed , and @entity64 and the @entity65 have a big appetite for gold , too			1
while it may be culturally important to own gold in parts of the world , @entity49 also said central banks still feel the need to own it			1
" that 's not going to go away			0
central banks are still buying it			1
it trades like a currency on most days , " added @entity49			0
or as a recent @entity61 report put it : " with many economic and geopolitical wounds still open , central banks once again sought the protection and diversification of gold			1
" @entity83 has built a gold exchange over the last dozen or so years , and having just opened it up to international players its goal is to make that the largest physical bullion market in the world ; @entity49 says " that 's a sign that the market continues to move to the @entity92			1
" digging deep logistically , however , @entity49 says it 's necessary to go further afield to find quality ore deposits			0
" the easy stuff 's been found now			0
you look at the industry average , gold grade is a little over one gram per ton , and so the gold reports in minute particles and as a result of that you 're having to move much more rock than you used to , to get the same amount of gold , " said @entity49			0
it 's a laborious process that uses chemicals to extract tiny particles of gold			2
the kittila mine is expected to remain open until at least 2036 , as @entity51 has already discovered the gold reserve is in excess of 7 - 8 million ounces , much higher than its original estimate of 1.5 million ounces			2
in order to achieve this , the company will have to take the mine down at least 900 meters ( over half a mile ) below the surface			0
but one thing is for certain : gold 's popularity has not waned			2
" i do n't think gold 's going to go away , i think it still has an important role to play , " said @entity49 .			2
