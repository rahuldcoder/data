you just watch the @entity3 for the commercials			1
here at @entity6 , most of us also enjoyed what turned out to be a pretty competitive game			0
not to mention an excuse to obsess over @entity10 for a few hours			0
but that did n't mean we did n't take notice of which web and tech companies shelled out the big bucks to nestle in between ads for corn chips and beer in black bottles			1
gone are the halcyon days when every tech - bubble startup with a dream and a sock puppet advertised during the game			1
but plenty of heavy hitters were in evidence			0
in no particular order , here they are , with a little tech - world analysis about what , if anything , they achieved : @entity34 we 're calling this one the tech winner of the night			1
because who does n't love @entity38 ? the " @entity42 " and ex- " @entity44 " star rattles off rapid - fire consumer tech questions while playfully sexually harassing a @entity34 clerk ( but in a really cute way )			1
" is it enough to get tech - obsessed shoppers to forgo online retailers for a good , old - fashioned brick - and - mortar store ? we 're not sure			1
but it was a valiant effort			0
it also showcased the store 's emphasis on selling mobile gadgets instead of tvs or home electronics			2
some of our favorite one - liners : " what 's @entity60 ? is it contagious ? " " can i use a dongle with this ? does it make you uncomfortable when i use the word ' dongle ' ? " " what 's the cloud ? where is the cloud ? are we in the cloud now ? " " will this ( a tablet ) read ' @entity76 ' to me in a sexy voice ? will you ? " @entity79 the web address clearinghouse kept to its usual @entity3 - ad strategy			1
which is to say , titillating some while annoying or disgusting many others			0
this year , it was a splotchy - faced nerd ( yay , stereotypes ! ) sucking face with supermodel @entity87			2
the makeout session , meant to highlight @entity79 's " when @entity90 " slogan , came complete with superimposed sucking sounds that would have felt right at home during a face - hugger assault from " @entity94			1
" at least race - car driver @entity95 left her clothes on this time			2
everyone did , in fact , but that likely did n't appease many critics of @entity79 's lad - mag - style commercials			1
who was the smart one again ? not the woman ? gotcha			0
all that said , how many more domain - registration companies can you name without a @entity110 search ? @entity111 instead of focusing on a single product , @entity111 used funnymen @entity113 and @entity115 basically to say " @entity111 " a lot while pretending to fight over who will get to be in the commercial			2
they both brandish @entity120 smartphones , while @entity121 makes an appearance via the screen of a @entity124			0
but the main point here seems to be to continue establishing the brand as a fun alternative to @entity129 ( which , notably , did n't buy @entity3 tv time )			2
and to let the world know @entity113 would wear a diaper for @entity111			0
@entity133 fresh off unveiling its @entity133 operating system and two new phones , the company tried to keep its badly needed momentum going with a 30 - second spot in which a guy uses the new @entity140 to set himself on fire , grow elephant legs and magically turn an out - of - control big rig into an exploding pile of rubber duckies			1
the point ? in 30 seconds , it 's easier to show you what the phone ca n't do than all the things it can			2
and the important thing is to get people talking			0
but when @entity158 asks if it 's " the dumbest tech ad you 've ever seen , " maybe it was n't exactly the 108 - yard touchdown run of advertising			1
@entity163 once the darling of the @entity166 world with its droid phones , @entity163 has faded as @entity111 's @entity168 has become arguably the chief rival to the @entity170			1
so , how to get back in the spotlight again ? apparently by putting @entity172 in a bubble bath			0
she wonders what would happen if she posts a nudie shot using a @entity176			0
cue montage : among scenes of a power line exploding and construction workers looking distracted , there 's a stereotypically sassy gay couple slapping each other and some implied ... well , masturbation			2
are we sure this was n't another @entity79 ad ? we 're not sure how far this will springboard @entity163 , now owned by @entity110			1
and ... you know ... other things , apparently			0
@entity192 more creepy talking baby			0
please -- make it stop .			0
