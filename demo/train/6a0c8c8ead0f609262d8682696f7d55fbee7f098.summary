@entity1 , @entity0 -- despite the fact that some of the effects of climate change are still imperceptible to all but the most highly trained eyes , there can be no doubting the alarming picture painted by glacier melt			1
the @entity12 application includes audio , video , slideshows and a documentary film			1
as these rivers of ice retreat back up the valleys they carved out , so scientists ' knowledge of climate change advances , in turn helping us recognize the signs of a warming world			1
now a new @entity12 app is helping visitors to the @entity30 understand how climate change is altering the landscape			1
developed by the @entity34 at the @entity35 in @entity36 and @entity30 software company , @entity37 , the @entity33 is an interactive guide to glaciers and climate change			1
for a fee of 20 chf ( around $ 19 ) visitors to the @entity44 region can hire an iphone loaded with the app. @entity47 , @entity48 at the @entity49 , told @entity2 what people can expect from the device			2
" there are many different levels to the application			0
audio pieces -- like the ones you might expect to find in a museum guide which guide you through paths on seven different trails			2
" at different stages along each trail , the phones -- aided by the built - in @entity64 -- alert visitors to particular points of interest by sounding a yodel			2
" for example , " @entity47 explained , " if you are standing in front of a glacier you will be told why it is no longer as big and provided with images of what it looked like 100 years ago , and what it might look like in the future			2
" there are more than 40 audio guides , plus a range of multimedia offerings including videos , slide shows and a documentary film			1
there are also sections which describe the various flora on the trails along with information on biodiversity			0
" everyone who tries it is quite fascinated by it , " @entity47 said			0
" people are realizing that climate change is real when they see the consequences			0
" the @entity44 region is home to the upper and lower @entity100 glaciers , which have retreated rapidly in recent years			1
in 2008 , the @entity101 reported that glaciers in some regions of the world were melting away at a rate of more than a meter a year recently			0
responding to the 2008 report , @entity106 , executive director of the @entity107 , said : " millions , if not billions , of people depend directly or indirectly on these natural water storage facilities for drinking water , agriculture , industry and power generation			0
" " there are many canaries emerging in the climate change coal mine , " @entity116 added			0
" the glaciers are perhaps among those making the most noise			0
" in the future , @entity47 says the @entity35 hopes to produce features that can be used by teachers in preparation for taking classes to the glaciers .			1
