-- you may tell your airline if you prefer an aisle seat to a window seat or if you 'd rather have chicken than pasta			0
some things , however , like the fact that you pick all the cashews from the mixed nuts , or that you always drink a gin and tonic in the airline lounge , you might not			0
lately , though , airlines have a way of knowing your preferences , even when you do n't tell them			2
the culprit ? social media , of course			1
recently @entity21 started a tryout to monitor digital conversations on social - media sites like @entity25 or on @entity26			1
the technology comes from @entity30 start - up local measure , and it allows corporate clients to search not by keyword but by @entity33 coordinates			2
as a result , when a customer posts a picture on @entity38 ( even one without a caption ) from one of ten @entity21 airport lounges , the customer care team is alerted immediately			1
" it allows us to pinpoint customer feedback to a specific location			0
if someone raises an issue , it gives our lounge staff the ability to step in and resolve the problem , " says @entity46 , head of digital communication at @entity21			1
if a customer groans on @entity25 about a long line at the coffee counter or a broken printer in the business lounge , @entity21 can respond in real time			1
according to @entity60 , chief executive at local @entity28 , other airlines will be soon introducing the technology to their lounges as well , allowing the companies not only to respond to problems , but to anticipate them as well			0
" it helps our clients better understand what people are thinking about their experience , " he says			0

the next time he visited the lounge , the cereal was there			0
" @entity21 knew how to surprise and delight the consumer			2
it 's all little things , but they do add up , " he says			0
because of the speed with which a staff member can respond on @entity25 or @entity26 , social media has quickly become a favored platform for airlines ' customer service			1
@entity93 employs 130 people to monitor different social - media platforms , including @entity96 , a social networking website popular among @entity99 - speaking users , and @entity100 , the @entity101 equivalent of @entity25			1
social media has become such a popular medium for @entity93 customers that the company introduced an estimated service response time to their @entity25 account , even though the ability to do so is n't built into @entity25 ( @entity93 works around this by updating the background image every five minutes )			1
for the most part , response times hover around one hour			0

reflecting how attuned the company is to their online followers and customers , their suggestions help @entity93 create new products and services , including one introduced last week that allows non-passengers to purchase upgrades and gifts for friends and family traveling with the airline			2
other ideas developed from social media are destination guides based on cabin - crew favorite spots , and a service that allows staff members sweep planes for forgotten wallets , tablets and mobile phones , and contact the customers ( sometimes before they realize their item is missing )			1
" if these were suggested to me four years ago , i might have said , ' these are n't relevant , ' but now we know that they are , because we get messages coming in every day telling us they are , " says van der @entity145			0
" we have 30,000 interactions a week			0
that 's a lot of input , and it 's motivated us to keep pushing the envelope			0
