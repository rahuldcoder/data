-- affirmative action -- which is coming up before the @entity2 on wednesday in @entity3 -- has long been one of @entity6 's most divisive social policies			1
but it does n't need to be			0
universities engage in many forms of affirmative action that are uncontroversial , such as efforts to reach out and encourage minority applicants , or initiatives to make sure that admissions officers are going beyond test scores to find the strongest candidates			1
the battle is really about the use of racial preferences in admissions , especially the large preferences often used by selective schools that , in effect , add a full point to the high school grade - point average of every black applicant , and half a point to every @entity29 applicant , or otherwise adjust the academic qualifications of black and @entity29 applicants so as to make them appear , for purposes of comparison with white and @entity36 applicants , much more academically prepared than they actually are			1
these policies are often justified as ways of ensuring fair minority representation -- which , in turn , is supposed to foster a better learning environment for everyone			0
but a growing stack of carefully vetted research is finding that these large preferences often undermine the very goals they are intended to promote , because they do a poor job of matching students to the college environments in which they are most likely to thrive			1
a student who would do extremely well at @entity51 ends up at struggling at @entity52 ; a student who would thrive at a strong state university gets recruited away to the @entity55 and becomes a marginal student			0
news : the young woman at the center of the @entity2 challenge for example , students who aspire to careers in science or engineering ( @entity66 fields ) , and who get into a school where they are surrounded by academically stronger students , have low odds of actually getting a @entity66 degree			2
yet these students have what it takes to have a successful career in @entity66 -- if they go to the right school			0
a careful study led by @entity80 psychologist @entity79 found that the well - matched minority students were nearly 80 % more likely to achieve their @entity66 aspirations			1
three other studies have confirmed @entity79 's findings			0
in @entity87 -- the case before the @entity2 -- the @entity86 reintroduced racial preferences in 2004 because , it said , it wanted to achieve racial balancing of minority students in its classes			1
but it has pursued this goal with very large preferences , and since these students are likely to retreat from the most competitive and rigorous classes to softer fields , the use of racial preferences can easily have little or no effect at all upon classroom integration			1
the mismatch problem undermines diversity goals in other ways , too			1
undisputed research has found that students are more likely ( holding other things , such as race , constant ) to make friendships with other students who have comparable levels of academic preparation			0
when colleges use large preferences , they interfere with social assimilation , and the minorities who are the " beneficiaries " of these preferences often feel socially isolated and self - segregate			0
indeed , preferences that are so large that they produce disparities in academic performance across racial lines are likely to foster negative stereotypes -- just the opposite of what diversity programs are supposed to achieve			2
in short , large racial preferences , and indeed large preferences of any other kind ( e.g. , for children of alumni , for athletes , etc. ) are often counterproductive			1
yet universities continue to use them , partly because they may not understand the consequences of mismatch , but mainly because they are under tremendous pressure to achieve a particular racial balance -- at whatever cost -- in their student bodies			0
these are exactly the situations where government regulation has a helpful role to play , and the @entity2 is poised to play it			0
news : affirmative action under pressure in @entity2 many observers are predicting that the court , with five conservative votes , will simply abolish racial preferences			1
that strikes us as unlikely ; justice @entity155 , the swing vote , is more likely to put teeth in the court 's earlier holdings and simply create some tougher tests that universities must satisfy if they use racial preferences			1
two reforms seem to us particularly important : find a way to limit the overall size of racial preferences , and mandate a thorough transparency at any university that wants to use them			2
limiting the size of racial preferences means making smaller , race - based adjustments to applicant qualifications -- or , to put it differently , not ignoring very wide differences in academic preparation across racial lines			2
and by transparency we mean three things : disclose to applicants the way that admissions decisions are made , provide information about how students such as the applicant have fared at that university , and make some form of all this information available to the public and to watchdog groups			0
in other words , students need to have all available information about whether they are jeopardizing their success in college by accepting a large preference into a more elite school			0
these sorts of reforms would represent a radical departure from past practices ; they would create a level of accountability that simply does not exist in colleges today			0
and they would almost certainly moderate the use of a controversial and often ineffective tool of social policy -- racial preferences -- without the heavy hand of a complete ban			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity214 and @entity215			2

@entity2 is taking up affirmative action in @entity3
@entity214 , @entity215 : large racial preferences can hurt minority students
they say the court will probably not abolish affirmative action in the case
