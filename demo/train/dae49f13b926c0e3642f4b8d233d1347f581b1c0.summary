-- with @entity2 governor @entity1 dominating the news , let 's look back at a five other so - called virtuous figures who became embroiled in sex scandals -- and this list just scratches the surface			1
@entity10 admitted to cheating on his wife @entity11			1
@entity12 by the mid- 1920s , evangelist @entity12 was packing them in at her @entity14 in @entity15 , preaching hope and warning against the sinful life			1
but in 1926 , she disappeared while swimming at a local beach			2
she turned up a month later with a fantastic story about being kidnapped and taken to @entity22			2
unfortunately , the evidence said otherwise : it appeared @entity12 had been shacked up with a married man			1
the evangelist was charged with perjury , but she stuck to her story and was eventually acquitted			1
her popularity waned after the scandal , but you got ta hand it to her for chutzpah : instead of apologizing to her confused flock , @entity12 bobbed her hair , bought some short skirts , and began dancing and drinking in public			1
@entity10 simple people with a simple dream , @entity41 and @entity11 started out hosting a children 's religious puppet show			1
by the mid- 1970s , however , the fabulous @entity11 duo had become the toast of televangelism			2
they pulled in millions of dollars in contributions to their @entity49 ( @entity50 ) ministry , and even built a sort of fundamentalist @entity53 called @entity54 in @entity2			2
@entity0 : proposing the presidential way but @entity41 had a couple of dirty little secrets			2
he had paid a former church secretary named @entity59 to keep quiet about a sexual encounter they had in 1980			2
but when the scandal broke in 1987 , questions began to be raised about @entity11 's financial dealings			1
in 1989 , he was sentenced to 45 years in prison for fleecing his flock of $ 158 million			2
in the end he only served five , and moved forward with his life , eventually opening a new ministry in a restaurant in @entity71 , @entity72			0
@entity0 : 10 great love affairs in history 3			0
@entity75 @entity75 was one of @entity10 's fiercest critics when the @entity11 scandal broke , telling an interviewer he himself had never even kissed a woman other than his wife			1
but the bombastic and fantastically successful television preacher -- and cousin to rock - and - roll legend @entity83 -- was doing something with that prostitute in a cheap @entity87 hotel room in early 1988			1
@entity75 's tearful , televised confession kept his $ 12 - million - a - year , 10,000 - employee religious empire together -- until he got caught with his pants down again			1
that 's right , @entity75 was linked to ( brace yourself ! ) another hooker in 1991			1
a couple of lost lawsuits , an @entity97 tax lien , and that was the end of the line for @entity75			1
he 's still hurling rhetorical fire and brimstone on tv , radio and online , albeit on a much smaller scale			1
@entity0 : 10 aphrodisiacs around the world 4			0
@entity109 a onetime art student , @entity109 came to the @entity111 from @entity112 in 1960			0
he began giving yoga lessons on the side and ended up training several thousand people , who in turn became yoga instructors around the country			0
with his followers calling him " guru dev , " or " beloved teacher , " one of the things @entity109 taught at the yoga center he founded in @entity124 in 1972 was that celibacy was spiritually mandatory for unmarried people			0
@entity109 even took a vow of celibacy himself in 1974 , despite being married with children			1
no wonder it was something of a shock ( perhaps greatest to his wife ) when in 1994 , the beloved teacher admitted to having affairs with three of his followers			0
the scandal forced @entity109 to resign his $ 150,000 - a - year post			0
he eventually moved to @entity138 , but kept up the yoga			0
@entity140 in the 1970s , @entity140 was known as " the hippie priest " ; he was a @entity142 clergyman whose specialty was ministering to kids struggling with their sexual identity			0
by 2002 , however , @entity140 was a central figure in the greatest scandal ever to hit the @entity142 in the @entity111			0
@entity140 was accused of molesting more than two dozen boys over a 35 - year span			0
subsequent investigations into other allegations in the @entity153 archdiocese resulted in the @entity142 paying $ 85 million in 2003 to 552 people who claimed to have been abused by priests			0
it also triggered similar probes , and similar results , in other areas of the country			0
in 2005 , at the age of 74 , @entity140 was sentenced to 12 to 15 years in prison			0
