-- do you believe in second chances ? it would appear that those wearing the green and white of @entity7 do			0
having been handed a brutal beating by @entity12 side @entity11 in the third qualifying round of the @entity14 , @entity7 's @entity9 adventure appeared to be over before it had started			1
a 4 - 1 defeat in the @entity12 capital was followed by a 2 - 0 home defeat -- a result which should have sent @entity11 through to the playoff stage			1
instead , @entity21 , the game 's @entity9 governing body , was called in to rule over claims @entity11 had fielded an ineligible player during the tie			0
@entity26 , who entered the action with two minutes of the second leg remaining , was supposed to be serving a ban			0
it was his presence on the field which meant @entity21 awarded the game to @entity7 3 - 0 , making it 4 - 4 on aggregate and allowing the @entity36 champion to progress on away goals			1
while @entity11 protested , even taking their failed case to @entity39 , the @entity40 for the @entity41 , @entity7 ensured it made the most of it fortune			2
a game against @entity49 champion @entity47 was @entity7 's reward with the opportunity to play some of @entity9 football 's biggest names the prize			2
@entity7 , which won the @entity14 in 1967 , took the lead within six minutes of the kickoff when @entity57 fired home from close range after @entity61 's effort was diverted into his path			2
@entity47 , which last reached the group stage of the tournament in 1999 , overcame @entity65 3 - 2 on aggregate in the previous round			0
and it soon carved @entity7 open to claim a deserved equalizer when @entity69 ran through to slot the ball past the onrushing @entity71			0
both teams had opportunities to win the game with @entity75 and @entity76 going close for the visitors , while @entity79 ' rasping effort flew just over the crossbar for @entity47			0
the two will meet again next tuesday with @entity7 now the firm favorite to progress following the 1 - 1 draw			1
elsewhere , @entity84 , the 2004 champion , gained an impressive 1 - 0 win at @entity88 side @entity87			1
@entity90 's 61st minute strike was enough to give @entity84 a slender advantage going into next week 's second leg			0
in @entity94 , @entity93 scored the only goal of the game as @entity97 recorded a 1 - 0 away win at @entity98			1
in the night 's other games , @entity99 drew 1 - 1 with @entity101 , while @entity102 and @entity103 finished 1 - 1 .			2

@entity7 held 1 - 1 by @entity49 side @entity47 in @entity14 playoff
@entity36 champion will host second leg next *wednesday*
@entity7 qualified after @entity11 was thrown out of *competition*
