-- when faced with the most ferocious waves on the planet , most people would seek protection in the largest , sturdiest vessel they could find			2
but when @entity8 pensioner @entity7 sets out on his ambitious mission to circumnavigate the globe , it wo n't be in a hefty ship piled high with food , creature comforts and telecommunications equipment			2
instead , the 73 - year - old plans to traverse the high seas cocooned in a sailboat only slightly bigger than a bathtub			1
for many , the proposition of sailing non-stop around the world for a year - and - a - half in a vessel just three meters - long will sound rather ambitious , and coming from a man well past the retirement age , downright far - fetched			1
indeed , few would likely take the idea seriously were yrvind not one of the world 's most respected boat - builders			1
during his accomplished life he has given lectures to the @entity8 king and queen and received awards from the prestigious @entity33 in @entity34 , among others			0
" people have said it 's a suicide mission , " said @entity7			1
" but a big boat is actually more dangerous than a small one			2
you 've got bigger forces throwing you around -- a bigger engine , a bigger beam , a bigger deck			2
" my small boat is like a little capsule -- nothing can happen to you			0
it 's like throwing a bottle in the water -- it will capsize , it will pitchpole ( somersault ) , but it will always come back up , " he added			0
if successful , @entity7 will make history for sailing the smallest boat around the world without docking on land			1
the record is currently held by @entity61 @entity60 , who in 2010 circumnavigated the globe in a 6.5 meter yacht -- more than double the size of @entity7 's creation			1
@entity7 , from the small village of @entity67 in south east @entity8 , started building the ground - breaking vessel in march			1
now half - complete , he is reluctant to put a time on its launch			0
click on the pindrops above to trace @entity7 's proposed circumnavigation route			1
named @entity75 after its 10 foot length , the miniature vessel will be just 1.8 meters wide with two six meter - tall masts			2
weighing 1.5 tons , it will be made out of a composite foam and fiberglass material which , he says , is " excellent for insulation and floatation			0
" powered by wind , solar panels , gel batteries and a foot crank , @entity75 will set sail from @entity88 in a 48,000 kilometer return journey around the globe			0
sir @entity91 , the first person to sail around the world in 1969 in a 9.8 meter yacht , said there was a real possibility @entity7 would complete the voyage			1
briton @entity91 , who also founded the @entity97 , added that many people had thought his own bid to circumnavigate the globe was impossible at the time			2
" one of the biggest challenges he 'll face is when he 's coming up against these massive 25 meter waves in the @entity105			0
in a boat that size he 's just going to be rolled around and around like he 's inside a giant washing machine , " @entity91 said			1
" he might also find he 's using a lot more energy -- and will need a lot more food -- being rolled around like that			0
" the @entity8 will collect rainwater in sails , funneled by a hose to a tank			0
with no heating equipment on board , he 'll rely on 400 kilograms of muesli and sardines , supplemented with vitamin tablets and fish caught from the sea			0
" i need just half - a - kilogram of food a day and this will give me enough food for 800 days , " he said			0
" in the beginning i will have fruit but obviously that will run out			0
i also have a friend in @entity132 with a boat who will come out with supplies			0
" the self - described " recluse " plans to spend his days swimming , philosophizing and reading more than 400 books , which weigh around 100 kilograms			2
" on land , people are watching tv , driving cars in traffic , smoking , drinking -- it 's not healthy , " @entity7 explained			1
" out at sea it 's a cleaner environment -- mentally and physically			0
when i come back i will be a healthier , younger person			0
this will prolong my life , not the other way around			0
" growing up on the small @entity8 island of @entity154 in the @entity155 , @entity7 quickly learned to sail in an area so remote he needed to cross water simply to buy a loaf of bread from the shop			1
in his 50 - year career building boats , @entity7 has been lavished with awards from around the world			1
in 1980 he received a @entity164 from the @entity33 in @entity34 for single - handedly sailing a six meter boat around the stormy waters of @entity167 , @entity168			2
eight years later he was inducted into the @entity170 's @entity169 , based in @entity171 , @entity172 , for his many single - handed expeditions			2
the museum also has one of @entity7 's boats on permanent display -- a six meter yacht he built in his mother 's basement and sailed from @entity8 to @entity171 in 1983			1
in 1989 @entity7 also built and sailed a 4.5 meter boat from @entity182 to @entity183 , now on display at the @entity8 @entity185 in @entity186			1
and the sprightly septuagenarian is no closer to slowing down -- last year sailing a tiny 4.5 meter - long boat from @entity88 to the @entity189			1
@entity7 , who is also on the look - out for sponsorship , hopes his boat will not simply break the record books , but pave the way for a new environmentally - friendly design for living			1
" we are on @entity199 living beyond our resources -- oil is running out , fossil fuels are running out , water is running out , " he said			0
" if i can show i can live on a boat 10 foot - long for more than a year , with all the food i need with me , i think it might benefit mankind			1
" for a man who " loves all things small , " should he accomplish the feat it would be a huge achievement in the history of sailing .			0
