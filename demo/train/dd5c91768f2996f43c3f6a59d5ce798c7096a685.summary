-- @entity1 is determined to banish his demons in @entity3 as he returns to the track where his 2010 formula one world championship chances disintegrated			1
the @entity7 driver was in pole position to grab his third career title last year , needing to finish in the top four to claim the crown			1
but the @entity12 team took the decision to bring @entity1 into the pits at an early stage and he spent the rest of the race stuck behind @entity19 's @entity18 , finishing seventh , and handing @entity21 's @entity20 his first ever world championship			1
a dominant @entity20 has n't looked back , retaining his title with four races of the 2011 season to go and @entity1 admits returning to the @entity26 will be a painful experience for him			1
" it would not be honest if i told you i wo n't be a bit uncomfortable thinking about it when i see the paddock for the first time , " @entity1 wrote in his blog on @entity7 's official website			2
" but then the feeling will vanish and it will leave room for the present , which is about aiming to do well this weekend and in the future : to learn as much as possible with next season in mind			0
" it 's right that it should be like that because in sport , as in the rest of life , you must always look ahead			0
" @entity3 2010 was an important stage in my career and i have no doubt that even through that bad day , my relationship with @entity7 has become even stronger			2
" @entity1 , from @entity54 , is currently third in the drivers ' world championship standings , 13 points behind @entity60 's @entity59 driver @entity58 in second			1
but the gulf between @entity20 and the rest of the field is underlined by his 134 - point lead over @entity58			2
@entity1 acknowledges that winning will be " difficult " in @entity3 but says he is keen to fight for a podium place to counter last year 's bitter disappointment			1
" i completely appreciate that winning will be very difficult , " he said			0
" in this closing part of the season the relative positions are very clear but we have also seen there are some conditions in which we can fight for victory : as happened in @entity77 , for example			0
" we know if we all get everything right we can fight for the top three but our natural qualifying position is on the third row			0
then in the race things can go differently but that is the realistic situation			0
" so our target is the podium			0
apart from anything else that result would allow me to fill a gap in my trophy cabinet as @entity3 is the only race on the calendar from which i have yet to bring home silverware			2

@entity1 out to erase the painful *memory* of the 2010 @entity3 @entity97
@entity1 needed a top four finish to win last year 's drivers ' championship but came seventh
instead @entity21 's @entity20 took the title and has already secured 2011 version
@entity1 heads into this weekend 's @entity108 third in the standings
