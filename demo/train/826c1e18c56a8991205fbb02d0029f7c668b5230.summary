-- in recent days , the @entity3 @entity2 primary has been referred to as the @entity4 , ground zero and even " @entity6			1
" this hyperbole has been matched by the outrageous amount of money being spent here on political tv advertising : $ 11.3 million			0
why ? there is a lot at stake in saturday 's contest , and the campaigns know it			0
without a strong finish , candidates will find that cash , supporters and key endorsements dry up			2
with it , they 'll live to fight another day			0
either way , @entity3 @entity2 will most likely continue their tradition of picking the candidate who turns out to be the @entity2 nominee , something they have done since 1980			1
here is a political primer from an actual @entity32 who is a veteran of many of these battles : first : does the @entity3 @entity2 primary deserve its reputation as a take - no - prisoners , bare - knuckled battleground , like the media keep saying ? yes			1
@entity43 , my tweet urged the candidates to " bring their big boy pants			2
" we have a long tradition here of hard - hitting attacks , both on the air and below the radar			2
this year is no different			0
we do n't just pick a candidate , we pick presidents here in @entity3			1
most of the campaigning is done in 15 @entity2 - leaning counties , which account for 80 % of the vote , with a focus on a " @entity61 " that make up more than 52 % of the vote			1
those seven pit the @entity64 social conservatives against the laissez - faire crowd along the @entity66			1
in @entity3 , we do n't register by parties ; the @entity2 primary is open to all those who call themselves @entity2			1
our voters are a much more diverse group than those in @entity74 and @entity75			2
yes , @entity77 conservatives dominate the @entity2 here , but victory in @entity3 means you have successfully appealed to a wide variety of @entity2 concerns			1
it means you have the support of fiscal conservatives ( @entity66 and @entity64 ) , social conservatives ( @entity64 and all around ) , transplanted retirees ( @entity64 and @entity87 ) , business owners ( @entity89 ) and veterans ( @entity91 and @entity66 )			2
yes , many of us do cling to our bibles , our guns , and also to our status as a right - to - work state			1
we are not big fans of the federal government			0
( example : the @entity100 recently tried to prevent @entity101 from building a multibillion - dollar plant in @entity103 that would create thousands of jobs because the board 's counsel said @entity101 was punishing workers in @entity108 for union activity ; the @entity100 has since dropped the case			1
) but i would be lying if i said the majority of @entity3 @entity2 voters are strongly anti-government			1
most here think there is a role for the government , but we disagree on just how big it should be			0
like everywhere else , the key issue here is jobs			2
yes , social issues matter a lot to voters			1
taxes and defense issues matter			1
but jobs and economic development matter most in 2012			1
our 9.9 % statewide unemployment puts us ahead of the national average and is partially due to a lack of jobs in rural areas			0
and yet , other areas are doing fairly well			0
consider that this past week , @entity137 announced a new $ 900 million investment that is expected to bring 300 new jobs , for starters , to @entity141 in the @entity64			0
along with the @entity143 automaker , we are also home to @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity101 ( no thanks to the @entity100 ) , @entity148 and many other manufacturers			0
we have thousands of small - business owners who take personal and professional risks every single day , creating jobs and opportunities for their families and communities			1
it is against this backdrop that close to 400,000 voters will cast their ballots saturday			0
each is really focused on one overriding theme : beating president @entity163			1
they will come from across the @entity2 spectrum , not just those hard - core ideologues that seem to make the most news			1
to give you an example , consider that on sunday , @entity169 secured the endorsement of the @entity171 , in the heart of the social conservatives			0
@entity175 , before dropping out of the race , received the endorsement of @entity177 , of @entity178			0
@entity179 and @entity180 are doing their best to recover from missteps and misstatements , and , well , @entity184 is @entity184			0
and of course , @entity185 is hoping to somehow capitalize on the support of the faith - based community after a conclave of evangelical leaders in @entity192 threw their support to him this past weekend			0
this will be more difficult with @entity179 and @entity196 still in the race , splitting the evangelical vote			0
as for results , barring a major mistake , i think @entity169 -- who is , and has consistently been , running well ahead of his rivals -- will be the last man standing here saturday night			0
and once again , @entity3 will have done her job			2
join @entity205 on @entity206 and follow updates on @entity208			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity211 .			2

@entity211 : @entity3 primary winner *historically* ends up with @entity2 presidential *nod*
he says @entity2 there dominated by @entity77 conservatives , but engaged on diverse issues
he says right - to - work , immigration , tax and defense issues matter , but mostly jobs
@entity211 : regions of state may differ on candidates , but @entity2 united on *wanting* to beat @entity163
