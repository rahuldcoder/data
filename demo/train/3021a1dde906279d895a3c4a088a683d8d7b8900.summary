@entity0 -- the @entity2 proposed a $ 2.75 million civil penalty against @entity4 on friday for allegedly using certain parts in 777 construction that did not meet standards and repeatedly missing deadlines to address related quality control issues			1
" safety is our top priority and a robust quality control system is a vital part of maintaining the world 's safest air transportation system , " transportation secretary @entity10 said in a statement			1
the @entity2 said @entity4 's commercial aircraft division took more than two years after learning about quality control gaps involving fasteners in 777 construction to fully address the problem			1
metal fasteners were used in a number of areas , including to attach the wing skin to the wing structures , the @entity2 said			0
the issue did not present an immediate concern for the safety of the plane but manufacturers agree to follow rigid @entity2 standards when a plane is certified , and that includes rules on parts			2
a workhorse aircraft , the twin - engine 777 -- or " @entity40 " -- is flown by airlines worldwide			0
problems began in 2008 when the @entity2 said @entity4 discovered it had been installing fasteners that did not meet government standards on the long - haul jets			1
it stopped using them immediately , but some of the underlying manufacturing concerns persisted			0
the @entity2 said @entity4 repeatedly granted itself extensions and then missed the deadlines , ultimately not acting on a comprehensive fix until 2010			1
" manufacturers must make it a priority to identify and correct quality problems in a timely manner , " said @entity2 administrator @entity52			2
this was the second major @entity2 civil penalty proposal against @entity4 in as many years for missing deadlines			1
the agency proposed a $ 13.5 million fine in 2012 over the company 's alleged failure to provide information to airlines about reducing fuel tank flammability			0
that case grew out of the mid-air explosion that brought down @entity70 in 1996			0
the @entity2 also grounded @entity4 's @entity71 in january due to battery related fire risk			2
@entity4 had to address regulatory safety concerns before those planes could fly again			0
the world 's largest aircraft manufacturer said in a statement that it takes " any concern about safety , compliance and conformity very seriously , " but depicted the case raised on friday as an old " administrative issue " that has been settled			0
@entity4 said its response includes a robust database for tracking potential problems , additional management oversight and communication with the @entity2 to ensure that any concerns are resolved in a timely manner			1
" we are working closely with the @entity2 to ensure we understand and address any remaining concerns with this proposed penalty , " @entity4 said , promising a formal response within the 30 - day period allowed by the government			1
the term " fastener " in aviation describes any number of items , including bolts , rivets and other items used in assembling planes			0
the @entity2 did not specify the type of fastener in this case , but said the parts that did not conform with its standards were manufactured between 1993 and 2008			2
aircraft manufacturers use hundreds of thousands of fasteners during construction .			0
