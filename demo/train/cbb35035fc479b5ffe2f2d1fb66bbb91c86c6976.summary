-- the wide avenues of @entity2 became a colorful mosaic of the faces and flags of throngs of @entity8 people -- 600,000 of them , according to state media -- as people gathered to commemorate @entity12 , or @entity13 , on sunday			1
but with the recent announcement of possibly sweeping , dramatic changes to @entity8 's economic system , and the difficulties international media face in speaking to @entity8 , it is difficult to know with certainty what the mood on those streets is			1
two days ago , @entity8 's state - run @entity24 predicted that today 's parade would be a " brilliant culmination of the popular mass participation of workers and people in the open and democratic process of discussion " that yielded the recent announcement of economic changes following the @entity34 of mid-april			1
but if mood and turnout at the parade were predictable , it was precisely because " @entity8 workers are told by the government to march on may 1 , and then afterwards , the @entity8 government decides what the people were marching for , " said @entity44 , executive director of the online @entity45 , a site dedicated to the opening and reform of @entity8 's society and economy			1
@entity51 says similar turnouts in previous years have officially been attributed to other reasons			0
but given compulsory attendance and the lack of full , transparent information among @entity8 people , he finds efforts to attribute large turnouts to people 's strong political feelings misleading			1
an end to those classic cars in @entity8 ? less than two weeks ago , @entity8 's @entity63 held its @entity34 -- its first in 14 years -- and announced that it had approved drastic changes , including term limits for its top leaders , the gradual elimination of the ration card system , the purchase and sale of housing and cars , and massive layoffs , which the president has said will exceed one million			1
among average @entity8 , neither the timetable of implementation nor the final details of these changes are known			2
it is not even clear if they will be formally announced at some future time			0
this leads to a cautious , if optimistic , uncertainty , @entity51 said			0
" there is a lot of anticipation because people are in a desperate situation			2
but a lot of the fear is from people who will lose state jobs , or people concerned with losing elements of the ration system , especially older people			0
people are curious ... because in the past , these types of reforms have been rolled back			0
" " plans are still to lay off 500,000 workers in the next few months , and one has to wonder how many of those who attended ( the @entity13 commemorations ) are doing so in the hope of avoiding that fate , " said @entity101 , director of the @entity102 at @entity103 in @entity104 @entity51 says the timing of the @entity34 is indicative of a lack of party confidence : by preceding the @entity34 with the 50th anniversary of the @entity116 , and following the @entity34 with @entity13 marches , the party maximized nationalist sentiment and the appearance of massive popular support			1
and as to why the @entity34 would happen this year , as opposed to previous years , @entity51 said the desire for change has simply grown too strong			0
" it 's no longer taboo in @entity8 to recognize that the system has failed			2
( president ) @entity127 has encouraged people to debate what measures should be taken , " @entity51 said of the possibilities of real reform			0
" more importantly , " he added , " there is no alternative			0
