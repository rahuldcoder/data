boat after boat , body after body from a capsized @entity5 ferry came ashore sunday morning , a solemn process interrupted by piercing cries and screams from passengers ' kin			1
the wrenching scene came after four police boats arrived in rapid succession			2
the first carried four bodies			2
the second boat had three more , likewise the third and fourth			2
each body was taken onto a stretcher on the dock in @entity18 , draped in cloth			2
after an inspection , they were carried along a path guarded by police -- who themselves shed tears -- and past even more outwardly emotional family members			2
these relatives cried and , in some cases , yelled loudly , clearly overtaken by the moment			0
some of those shouts came from inside the identification tent			0
one man yelled out , " wake up ! wake up , please ! " the arrival of the 13 bodies corresponds with the @entity5 coast guard 's announcement , a short time earlier , that the death toll had increased by that number , up to 50			1
but few expect it to stop there			0
while 174 were rescued shortly after the vessel sunk wednesday , there have been none saved since despite extensive , exhaustive searches by air , from ships and by divers plunging into the frigid waters and ideally inside the now completely submerged ship itself			1
the number of those unaccounted for stood at 252 early sunday			2
relatives of some of them gathered in @entity18 -- the nearest port to the wreckage some 12 miles ( 20 kilometers ) away -- were asked earlier in the weekend to submit dna samples			0
