-- for the first time , researchers have succeeded in creating human embryonic stem cells by injecting @entity4 from a skin cell into an unfertilized egg , according to a study published wednesday			1
to achieve what is being called an " important step " in stem cell research , scientists in @entity9 used a cloning technique similar to the one used to clone @entity14 the sheep			1
" this work now demonstrates for the first time that the human egg has the ability to turn a specialized cell into a stem cell , " said @entity16 , who along with fellow study author @entity17 led the research team at the @entity19			1
" the goal of this research was to create patient - specific embryonic stem cells with the patients ' dna for the eventual use in cell replacement therapy , " @entity16 told @entity0			1
he said the motivation for the research was to eventually cure diseases such as @entity33 's , diabetes and many other illnesses			1
in 2005 , researchers in @entity37 claimed to have created the first human embryonic stem cells by cloning an embryo			2
a year later , it was revealed that the data had been faked			0
this new study , published in the journal nature , shows researchers have finally succeeded in creating human embryonic stem cells			2
they were n't perfect though because they have too many chromosomes -- 69 instead of the usual 46 -- making the cells suitable for research purposes only , not actual treatments			2
in the past , efforts to create human stem cells using cloning meant taking an unfertilized egg , removing egg 's nucleus with its 23 chromosomes and replacing it with the nucleus of a skin cell ( which has 46 chromosomes ) and placing the egg in a chemical bath to make it divide as if it had been fertilized by sperm			1
researchers started out with 270 donated oocytes or unfertilized eggs , provided by sixteen egg donors , @entity17 said			0
@entity16 said through a process of elimination , he and his colleagues determined that it was the removal of the egg 's genome , not the introduction of new dna or chemically initiating cell division , which was preventing the egg to develop far enough along so stem cells can be extracted			1
@entity17 says 63 eggs were needed to develop two cell lines , of which one was viable			2
" it 's the machinery within the egg that allows the egg to progress normally in development , " said @entity79 , who is a professor of @entity80 at the school of @entity82 at the @entity83			0
@entity79 , who is not involved in this new research , says this new study is n't a giant leap forward but it 's an interesting one			2
now the challenge is to figure out how to remove the egg 's chromosomes , without removing the machinery or spindle , which helps the egg divide			0
@entity16 said he and his colleagues are working on just that			0
researchers have been using adult stem cells like bone marrow for treatments for decades			0
but adult stem cells have been programmed for one part of the body and are not easily converted to correcting problems in other parts of the body			0
then the first major advance in human embryonic stem cell research came in 1998 , when @entity108 at the @entity83 , extracted the first stem cells from an existing human embryo			1
in 2007 , researchers in @entity112 and @entity113 reported the creation of stem cells by bypassing eggs altogether and reprogramming skin cells directly into dividing like fertilized eggs with the addition of four viruses			0
these cells are called induced pluripotent stem cells or ips cells			0
since then , researchers have found these cells have some limitations as well			0
while some opponents of embryonic research believe advances in the " less controversial " adult stem cell and ips cells eliminate the need for embryonic stem cell research , most experts in the field believe all three research paths need to be explored to eventually find the right treatment for the right disease			1
dr. @entity138 , who heads the @entity139 , which funds embryonic and adult stem cell research , says if researchers are able to take the next step and figure out how to make embryonic stem cells without the excess chromosomes , then they can begin to compare them to @entity132 cells and determine how different or similar they really are			1
" we need to better understand the biology of the human egg for reprogramming without the egg genome , " he said .			0

the achievement is an " important step " in stem cell research , scientists say
they used a technique similar to the one used to clone @entity14 the sheep
the motivation for the research was to eventually cure diseases such as @entity33 's , diabetes
