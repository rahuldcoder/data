for many millions of years , the oceans have been filled with the sounds of a geologically and biologically active planet : waves , rain , earthquakes and the songs of life from snapping shrimp to great whales			1
before the age of engine - driven ships , the resounding voices of the great whales could be heard across an ocean			1
today , in much of the @entity15 , commercial shipping clouds the marine acoustic environment with fog banks of noise , and the near continuous pounding of seismic airguns in search of fossil fuels beneath the seafloor thunder throughout the waters			1
in the ocean 's very quietest moments , blue whales singing off the @entity26 of @entity27 can sometimes be heard more than 1,500 miles away off the coast of @entity31			2
but on most days , that distance is a mere 50 to 100 miles			0
so why should we care ? over the past decade , scientists who study noise in the ocean have tried to understand how loud , man - made sounds disturb or injure whales and other marine mammals , even driving some to strand on beaches and die			1
it is time for us to focus on the more pernicious influence of chronic , large - scale noise on marine life			1
whales , dolphins and seals use sounds to communicate , navigate , find food and detect predators			1
the rising level of cumulative noise from energy exploration , offshore development and commercial shipping is a constant disruption on their social networks			1
for life in today 's ocean , the basic activities that we depend on for our lives on land are being eroded by the increasing amount of human noise beneath the waves			2
these stark realities are worrying			0
but emerging technologies for quantifying and visualizing the effects of noise pollution can help drive a paradigm shift in how we perceive , monitor , manage and mitigate human sounds in the ocean			2
ocean noise is a global problem , but the @entity77 should step up and lead the way			1
first , we must extend fledgling efforts to fully comprehend the acoustic footprint of our offshore and coastal activities			0
as a nation , we are failing the oceans by lacking a sufficiently effective program for listening to them			0
the @entity77 should develop and maintain dedicated undersea acoustic monitoring networks as integral parts of ocean observing systems			2
this would be lead by the @entity90 ( @entity90 ) and enabled through private and academic partnerships			0
such a plan has been developed ; now it should be implemented			0
second , we should encourage and accelerate the development of noise - reduction technologies			2
thanks to proactive collaborations among industries , scientists , environmentalists and government officials , efforts are underway within the @entity103 's @entity102 to develop quieting technologies for the most pervasive global noise source : large commercial ships			0
these and related technologies for reducing noise in oil exploration and marine construction should be standardized			0
finally , federal regulation on ocean noise must be changed			1
for decades , regulators have focused entirely on the short - term effects of one action at a time			0
a more holistic and biologically relevant risk assessment system , centered on the concepts of ocean acoustic habitats and ecosystems , is sorely needed			0
emerging trends in marine spatial planning are encouraging signs , as is @entity90 's support of two groups that are developing geospatial tools for mapping underwater noise and marine mammal distributions in @entity77 waters			1
the loss of acoustic habitats for marine species that rely on sound to live and prosper is increasing			0
the question is whether we humans value and will invest in a healthy ocean ecosystem that supports life , and in doing so , sustain our own health and future			1
join @entity141 on @entity142 and follow updates on @entity144			0

commercial shipping , other man - made sounds cause injury or death to marine life
whales , dolphins and seals use sounds to communicate , find food and detect predators
@entity159 , @entity160 : @entity77 needs to combat the problem of ocean noise
they say having a healthy ocean ecosystem will help humans sustain our own future
