-- the love of money may be the root of all evil according to the @entity4 , but that has n't stopped bookmakers from offering odds on who will emerge from the white smoke as the next pope			2
at odds as low as 2 - 1 , cardinal @entity12 , the archbishop of @entity13 , is the bookmakers ' favorite to succeed @entity16 , who thursday becomes the first pope to step down for almost 600 years			1
those betting an @entity19 will take the @entity21 's top job for the first time will be happy to hear @entity24 's cardinal @entity23 is running a close second at 5 - 2 , while cardinal @entity28 , the @entity27 secretary of state , is currently running third with odds of 3 - 1			1
more : conclave to elect new pope starts tuesday @entity32 , a spokeswoman at @entity35 bookmaker @entity33 , said more than Â £ 300,000 ( $ 450,000 ) in bets on the next pope have been placed since @entity16 's resignation -- and that 's before the papal conclave to choose the next church head has even started			1
" it 's our biggest non-sporting event of the year , " @entity44 told @entity0 , " and we expect the betting to really pick up as we head towards the conclave			1
" @entity48 cardinal @entity47 and @entity50 cardinal @entity49 round out @entity33 's top five -- and though betting on the next pope is illegal in the @entity52 , the @entity35 bookmaker is offering 20 - 1 odds on cardinal @entity54 , @entity52 's top @entity21			1
but @entity27 insiders are n't the only prospective pontiffs punters can wager on in the hopes that a puff of white smoke will finally put their bank accounts into the black			0
@entity44 says nine more bets have been placed on @entity63 -- the dimwitted fictional priest from @entity35 television sitcom " @entity67 " and a 10,000 - 1 underdog -- than for @entity68 , a @entity50 cardinal who also has the added benefit of being a real person			0
@entity33 says it has also drawn 20 bets at 1,000 - 1 that @entity73 singer @entity72 will be the next pope , and another five on @entity74 , the famously outspoken atheist and scientist , at an ominous 666 - 1			1
one @entity78 bookmaker is even offering 10,000 - 1 odds that disgraced @entity52 cyclist @entity80 will be chosen to head up the church			2
but the bookies ' odds are n't necessarily the best indicator of who the next pope will be , and a phrase repeated by cardinal @entity87 of @entity88 is worth remembering : " he who enters the conclave as a possible pope comes out a cardinal			0
" according to @entity44 , pope @entity16 was 20 - 1 after his predecessor 's death in 2005 before rising to 6 - 1 at the start of the conclave -- " up with the favorites , but not a nailed - on certainty			0
" while the next pope will almost certainly be chosen from among the cardinals set to attend the conclave at the @entity27 within the next few weeks , technically any practicing @entity21 can be elected to lead the church			0
so if you 're feeling lucky , there 's already one former leader living in @entity104 who has spare time on his hands			0
three - time ex-premier @entity108 may be an underdog -- but at 2,500 - 1 , at least there 's a chance .			2

@entity13 's @entity12 is odds - on favorite to be elected as next pope
@entity24 's @entity23 , @entity48 's @entity47 also in top five for @entity78 bookmakers
betting on next pope " biggest non-sporting event of year , " says @entity35 bookmaker
