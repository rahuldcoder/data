the 31 - year - old @entity15 has been accused of direct involvement in a transnational criminal group said to be composed of individuals from @entity13 and the @entity19 which had been targeted by the " @entity22 " investigation			2
authorities said the group 's activities included influencing the results of @entity6 league matches during the 2009 - 2010 and 2010 - 2011 seasons			1
investigations into this have targeted top clubs such as @entity31 , and involved a raid on the @entity6 team headquarters ahead of @entity34			0
" this is exactly the type of result which can be achieved when police share information in real time and use @entity44 's global network to locate , identify and arrest suspects , " said the head of the worldwide policing agency , @entity37			0
" the arrest of this suspected match - fixer could not have been achieved without @entity6 and @entity13 's close cooperation with @entity44 , nor without a great deal of behind - the - scenes work by prosecutors and magistrates			1
" those who doubted @entity13 's ability or commitment to fight match - fixing and bring those wanted for arrest to justice need to understand that @entity13 acts when the evidence exists and is shared and when their laws permit			1
@entity13 and @entity6 remain two of @entity44 's most active and effective member countries			0
" @entity44 said @entity9 was one of more than 500 fugitives wanted by 59 member countries as part of @entity68 -- which has so far led to 130 people being arrested or located			0
he is suspected of working for @entity13 businessman @entity70 , also known as @entity70 , who is also wanted by @entity6 authorities			0
@entity6 police said @entity9 had " spent a long period of inaction in @entity13 in close contact with other members of the group of this organization , including a well - known @entity13 citizen			1
" meanwhile , @entity13 police said thursday that four senior officers will go to @entity44 's @entity83 headquarters in @entity84 during the next fortnight to assist in match - fixing investigations			1
the force said it hoped to help build " a concrete case " against the individuals and syndicates involved			0
" the team aims to collect available information from these countries and seek their assistance to grant us access to evidence , witnesses and / or suspects whom they believe to be involved in the alleged match - fixing cases , " read a statement			1
" the team will also be exploring avenues to offer our assistance and share available information we have with these affected countries			0
" match - fixing has been described as a " disease " afflicting football by the secretary general of world governing body @entity111			1
on tuesday , @entity113 club @entity112 was stripped of its 2003 domestic league title and fined $ 160,000 after a crackdown against such activities			0
it was one of 12 clubs involved , along with 33 individuals			0
four former @entity121 internationals and an @entity123 referee were banned for life , having been jailed a year ago for the same offenses			0
@entity44 's @entity127 equivalent @entity128 has also revealed that 380 matches on the continent are under investigation , including top - level @entity133 games			0
the international players ' union @entity134 said in december that it is planning to launch an online match - fixing " hotline " for its members			1
on wednesday , the acting president of the @entity140 highlighted the need to eliminate match - fixing from the game			2
" we need to admit that match - fixing is a real danger to football 's ethical values and needs to be eliminated to preserve the sanctity of the sport , " @entity144 told delegates at the @entity44 conference in @entity147			1
" match - fixing is too complex and widespread for one organization to fight it alone			2
to fight this , we need a joint and coordinated effort			0
" @entity44 official @entity156 highlighted the social costs of match - fixing			2
" criminals can make millions in illicit profits from match - fixing with little risk of being detected and will exploit every opportunity , " he said at the conference			2
