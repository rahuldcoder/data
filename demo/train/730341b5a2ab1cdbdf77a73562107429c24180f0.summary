@entity0 -- a @entity0 judge dismissed sexual assault charges against former @entity5 chief @entity4 at the prosecutor 's request tuesday			1
a grand jury indicted @entity4 in may over allegations he sexually assaulted hotel housekeeper @entity10 in his @entity0 hotel suite			1
but in july , prosecutors began to back off the case , asking judge @entity14 to release @entity4 from house arrest after information surfaced that they said called @entity10 's credibility into question			1
on monday , prosecutors asked @entity14 to dismiss the charges entirely , while @entity10 's attorney filed a motion asking that manhattan district attorney @entity23 be disqualified from the case and that a special prosecutor be appointed			1
@entity14 rejected the request from @entity10 's attorneys and then , at a hearing tuesday morning , approved the request to dismiss charges			1
he had stayed implementation of the order to give @entity10 's attorneys time to appeal his decision on the special prosecutor			1
the @entity36 rejected the appeal tuesday afternoon , according to court attorney @entity38			0
@entity10 's attorney , @entity39 , decried the decision			1
" district attorney @entity23 has abandoned an innocent woman and has denied an innocent woman a chance to get justice in a rape case , " he said			0
@entity23 , in a news release tuesday , said prosecutors had no choice because they were " not persuaded -- beyond a reasonable doubt -- that a crime has been committed , based on the evidence we have			1
" he said @entity10 's testimony " was fatally damaged , for several key reasons			1
" in a statement , @entity4 -- who has always denied the charges -- thanked his attorneys and @entity14 for his decision			2
" these past two and a half months have been a nightmare for me and my family , " he said , adding that he was " obviously gratified that the district attorney agreed with my lawyers that this case had to be dismissed			2
" later , speaking to reporters outside his house , he said , " i am thankful for my wife , my children , my friends , and those who supported me during this period			0
i look forward to returning to my country , but i still have some things to do before i leave			0
i will explain more fully when i return			0
" @entity4 's attorneys said in a statement monday after prosecutors filed their request that it vindicated their consistent claim that their client is innocent			1
" mr. @entity4 and his family are grateful that the district attorney 's office took our concerns seriously and concluded on its own that this case can not proceed further , " attorneys @entity79 and @entity81 said in a statement			2
in a @entity91 news conference before the hearing , one of @entity10 's attorneys said dismissing the charges would be a travesty			1
" for the district attorney to now dismiss this case or seek to dismiss this case and turn his back on this victim because of so - called credibility issues is an affront not only on ms. @entity10 but an affront on all victims and sexual victims who come forward in the future , " attorney @entity95 said			2
prosecutors filed a " recommendation for dismissal " in the case monday , noting more questions about @entity10 's credibility			1
" the nature and number of the complainant 's falsehoods leave us unable to credit her version of events beyond a reasonable doubt , whatever the truth may be about the encounter between the complainant and the defendant , " the document states			0
" if we do not believe her beyond a reasonable doubt , we can not ask a jury to do so			0
" prosecutors voiced concern that the case appeared to rest exclusively on the housekeeper 's account , predicting her " falsehoods " would be " devastating " if revealed during a trial			2
they claim she " has not been truthful in matters great and small , " including lying about a " gang rape , as well as other details about her life in ( her native ) @entity140			0
" @entity10 lied about the specifics of her whereabouts after the incident and past details of an asylum application and information on tax forms , prosecutors said			1
she also admitted lying on the asylum application about having been a victim of a gang rape , even providing details of an attack and later admitting it never happened , according to prosecutors			0
in their court filing , prosecutors said that dna testing indicated semen on her dress matched @entity4 and shows there was a sexual encounter			1
there was " no trauma to her body or oral cavity " and " scrapings from underneath her fingernails ... yielded no results			0
" moreover , prosecutors claim @entity10 's current story of her " prompt outcry to her first supervisor is inconsistent with certain aspects of that supervisor 's account			1
" " all of the evidence that might be relevant to the contested issues of force and lack of consent is simply inconclusive , " wrote the prosecutors			2
@entity39 said @entity4 's power and prestige played a role in the outcome of the case , saying prosecutors would not " run from dna evidence " if @entity4 " was a plumber			1
" in @entity91 before the hearing , @entity95 disputed almost every aspect of the prosecution 's claim , saying a medical examination following the alleged rape showed bruises on @entity10 's vagina and that she suffered a " tear " on her shoulder and rips in her stockings			1
a " mountain of physical evidence " points toward a violent sexual assault during a nine - minute period inside @entity4 's @entity0 hotel suite in may , @entity95 told reporters in @entity212 , where he is gathering evidence for a civil lawsuit against the @entity212 citizen and onetime contender for that nation 's presidency			1
@entity10 quickly reported the incident to five co-workers and was visibly upset after the incident , shaken up , spitting and nearly vomiting , @entity95 said			0
he rejected explanations by @entity4 's attorneys that any sexual encounter that may have occurred was consensual , questioning how he could persuade a woman he had never met before to have sex during a nine - minute encounter			1
" there is no other plausible explanation " but sexual assault , @entity95 said			2
a crowd of protesters gathered near the courtroom in @entity0 in support of @entity10 , carrying handwritten signs reading " no impunity 4 rapists in power " and " @entity239 we believe you , " among other things			0
in tuesday 's news release , @entity23 said , " as prosecutors , we do n't work in a world where we expect or require perfect witnesses			0
the tens of thousands of victims who come to our office each year come from varied and often difficult circumstances , and sometimes with imperfect pasts			0
if we are convinced they are truthful about the crimes committed against them , and will tell the truth at trial , we will ask a jury to consider their testimony to prove a crime			0
if we are not convinced , we can not , should not and do not take the case to a jury			0
" he asserted that " seeking justice for sex crimes victims , and protecting immigrants , are among the highest priorities in this office , " but " we have to judge each case by its own unique set of facts			0
" attorneys for @entity10 said claims that @entity10 told a friend in prison that she was going to cash in on the incident were untrue and accused the district attorney 's office of treating @entity10 like a criminal defendant and not an alleged victim			2
in their now - rejected motion to have @entity23 removed from the case , @entity10 's attorney cited allegations of " abuse of confidence , unfair treatment and bias and prejudices " by @entity23 that they say disqualify him from the case			1
" are we telling ( sexual assault victims ) that if they dare to name a powerful , politically connected man as their abuser , they will see their whole life laid out to be judged publicly ? " asked @entity0 councilwoman @entity287			2
" what does it take for a low - income immigrant -- a woman of color -- to publicly name one of the most powerful men in @entity301 as a sexual abuser ? " @entity1 senior legal analyst @entity303 said before the hearing that @entity4 should now be able to breathe easier and " return to some semblance of his former life			2
" but he said that no one involved in the case " comes out of it looking very good			0
" " this is a case that looks like it has nothing but losers -- the alleged victim , the defendant , and the prosecutor , " @entity303 said			0
" the conclusion is likely to be entirely satisfying to no one			0

a judge approves dismissal of sexual assault charges against @entity4
@entity326 : prosecutors were " not persuaded ... that a crime has been committed "
the past weeks were " a nightmare , " @entity4 says
@entity10 's lawyer says there 's a " mountain of physical evidence " that @entity4 assaulted her
