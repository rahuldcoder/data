-- a tearful @entity1 retained her @entity3 title and world no. 1 ranking after overcoming crowd favorite @entity6 in a dramatic women 's final on saturday			1
the 23 - year - old broke down as she celebrated her second grand slam title , denying her @entity11 opponent her second after coming from behind to triumph 4 - 6 6 - 4 6 - 3 and claim the $ 2 million first prize			1
the @entity13 went into the match having upset local fans after taking a controversial 10 - minute medical break during a key point of her semifinal win over @entity21 teen @entity20 , but this time she was forced to wait as @entity6 twice had to receive lengthy treatment			1
the match was also interrupted in the deciding set by a break for the traditional @entity26 fireworks			1
" it 's been a real long two weeks , " @entity1 said on - court after winning in two hours and 40 minutes			2
" i will always keep very special memories of this court			0
it will be in my heart forever			0
" @entity6 , the losing finalist in 2011 , raced to a 5 - 2 lead in the opening set as she made a strong bid to add to her @entity37 title that same year -- a breakthrough win that made her the first @entity40 female to win a grand slam singles title			1
however , she was unable to show the same control that had allowed her to thrash world no. 2 @entity44 in straight sets in the semifinals			1
@entity1 led 3 - 0 in the second set , then sixth - ranked @entity6 went over on her ankle after winning the next game			1
it looked like it might bring the final to a premature end but the 30 - year - old got back on court after having her foot strapped and reduced the deficit further			2
however , @entity1 rallied to take the set and then broke @entity6 's serve to lead 1 - 0 in the third set			1
@entity6 broke back and then led 2 - 1 before the fireworks started in celebration of 225 years since the first fleet of colonists arrived from the @entity65			1
it was an inopportune break for @entity6 , who again went over on her ankle and banged her head on the court as she tried to protect her damaged foot			2
" for two seconds i could n't really see anything			0
it was totally black , " she told reporters			0
" so when the physio come , she was like , ' focus on my finger			0
i was thinking , ' this is a tennis court , not a hospital			0
' she was like , ' follow my finger , ' because i did n't follow			0
i just watched the eyes			0
she says , ' follow			0
' i say , ' why ? i 'm okay			0
' " @entity6 was unable to maintain momentum and @entity1 broke her serve to lead 3 - 2 -- the 15th break in just 27 games of an error - strewn match -- and went on to clinch the victory that denied @entity85 a return to the no. 1 spot			1
her more consistent approach paid off as @entity6 paid for making 57 unforced errors to 27 despite making 36 winners to @entity1 's 18			1
" it 's a completely different mix of feelings			0
this one is way more emotional , " said @entity1 , who last year topped the @entity94 money list with more than $ 7 million			2
" @entity6 was absolutely playing great tennis			2
unfortunate things that happened to her , you know , but that 's sport			0
" i 'm just happy that everything i went through , you know , i still could manage to give my best and really come out there and try to focus on my game and play tennis that i can produce			0
" meanwhile , @entity21 @entity104 and @entity105 won a record 13th men 's grand slam doubles title on saturday , thrashing @entity110 @entity109 and @entity111 in @entity112			2
the twin brothers moved past the 12 won by the @entity115 pair @entity114 and @entity116 in the 1960s and 1970s as they triumphed 6 - 3 6 - 4 in less than an hour			1
the 34 - year - olds , who won the @entity120 title last year , have now played in 23 grand slam finals .			2

world no. 1 @entity1 wins @entity3 title for the second year in a row
@entity13 beats crowd favorite and 2011 *runner* - up @entity6 4 - 6 6 - 4 6 - 3 in @entity112
