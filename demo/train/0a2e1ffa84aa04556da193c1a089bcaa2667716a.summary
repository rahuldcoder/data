-- they have blown out in spectacular style and drawn criticism from one of the world 's top drivers , but @entity7 insists there is nothing wrong with the tires it supplies to @entity12			1
@entity7 came under intense scrutiny after tire degradation led to four retirements at june 's @entity17 @entity16 , while @entity19 's two - time world champion @entity18 recently described the tires as " not good			1
" @entity7 's ceo has defended the rubber provided by the @entity24 manufacturer , suggesting some drivers are not using the tires correctly			1
" i have to say that he was very nervous when he said that , " @entity28 told @entity0 when asked about @entity18 's remarks at october 's @entity30 , which was won by newly - crowned drivers ' champion @entity31			2
" it was not because of tires -- he was n't able to win for a number of reasons			0
if they did n't use the tires properly , it 's not our fault			0
" @entity7 is in the third year of its agreement to supply tires to @entity12 , and @entity28 does not rule out the possibility of extending the company 's deal beyond 2015			1
he warns that , if the working relationship between @entity12 and @entity7 continues , teams should pay attention to the advised limits of each tire compound			2

" we can do whatever is needed , but with the respect of the rules , " the 65 - year - old said			0
" it means tires have to be used within the limits we provide teams			0
" while @entity7 's reputation in the paddock might have taken a knock , @entity28 insists the brand itself has not adversely affected by its association with @entity12 -- earning $ 1.5 billion on sales of over $ 8 billion last year			1
