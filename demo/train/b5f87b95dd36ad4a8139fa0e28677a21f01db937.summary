house speaker @entity0 's not waiting until @entity1 for a hangover -- his headache is already here			1
back - to - back @entity6 @entity5 dramas in the final week of the year are the latest indication that many of the issues the @entity5 hoped to leave behind when they take full control of @entity11 next week — an unruly base and scandal - prone members — will continue to dog them in the new year , and might even kick off 2015 with an attempted coup on the @entity17			1
though @entity0 was successfully able to convince rep. @entity20 to resign on monday after pleading guilty to a felony tax evasion charge last week , rep. @entity18 , the majority whip now embroiled in scandal over a 2002 address he gave to a white supremacist conference , remains a tougher mess to clean up , leaving the speaker open to attack from the left and the right			1
in a coordinated move , both @entity0 and his deputy , @entity6 majority leader @entity29 , issued back - to - back statements of support for @entity18 on tuesday afternoon			1
but the fallout of his appearance at a conference of the @entity36 — a group founded by the infamous white supremacist and former grand wizard of the @entity41 @entity40 — continued into tuesday night as multiple national newspapers issued op - eds calling for @entity18 to resign			2
but some in the party 's right flank are aiming their fire at @entity0			2
facing calls for a coup from his conservative base in next week 's speaker race that grew louder on tuesday , @entity0 ca n't afford to let @entity18 , a former @entity52 chairman and one of his strongest links to that conservative base , go			1
while this would n't be the first time that @entity0 's faced a conservative challenge for his speakership , many on tuesday began to speculate that the controversy surrounding @entity61 , and @entity0 's handling of it , may breathe new life into a challenge			1
@entity65 , a former @entity66 congressman and chairman of the @entity68 , warned that starting the new @entity11 with a coup attempt would be " catastrophic " for a party hoping to sell itself as the capable and effective alternative to @entity72 in the 2016 elections			2
" [ a speakership coup ] would be the worse thing that could happen to the party			0
it would show they ca n't govern their own caucus , let alone the government , " he said			0
" when people unhappy with @entity84 look to @entity5 for a governing party , this is the last thing they want to see			2
" he added : " they have an opportunity to really produce some good legislative outcomes			0
why would you jeopardize that at this point by starting of with turmoil ? " @entity0 's backing of @entity94 -- a move some on the right see as hypocritical -- put him in a precarious position heading into the speaker election			1
" this has got ta make @entity0 nervous , " one @entity6 @entity5 aide with ties to leadership told @entity99 of the continued controversy surrounding @entity61			1
that 's because , if the fallout for @entity18 continues , @entity0 may not be able to afford to keep him			1
@entity18 's alleged sins are n't unfamiliar to the @entity5 and exactly the kinds of associations the party is looking to avoid as it seeks to broaden its appeal to minority voters and improve its brand for the upcoming presidential elections			1
@entity72 seized on the development , with a member of @entity117 on monday calling for @entity0 to investigate the situation			0
on tuesday , a spokesman for @entity6 minority leader @entity120 called the development " deeply troubling			0
" and a @entity6 @entity72 leadership aide said the party plans to keep up the pressure on @entity0 and @entity18 in the coming weeks			1
there are also growing indications that even standing by @entity18 may not do @entity0 much good in terms of getting a handle on an unruly caucus that 's only grown more frustrated with leadership since the midterms			1
they recently emerged from a vote on a government funding bill crying mutiny because it failed to adequately oppose president @entity84 's unilateral move on deportations and @entity139			0
conservatives saw @entity18 's vote for the " cromnibus " as the latest in a long line of his betrayals of the base			2
despite repeated attempts , however , conservatives have never been able to lock down the necessary votes to oust @entity0 , and a viable opponent , or even send the speaker contest to a second round of votes			2
but @entity0 's support for @entity18 , some say , may cause enough ire within the base to reinvigorate the effort			1
what conservatives see as unequal treatment for a member of leadership has incensed many still smarting over their dismaying loss in the @entity166 race primary			0
during that race , sen. @entity168 's primary challenger , state sen. @entity169 , took heavy flak from the national and local @entity5 establishment for being billed alongside a white nationalist as a headliner at a conference that he never ultimately attended			2
@entity169 has said there 's a clear " double standard " at work , and in a text message monday night suggested that double standard could further stoke the ire of conservatives against leadership			0
" conservatives are driven and inspired by principles , not personalities			0
we therefore seek consistency with our elected officials			0
to the extent that they are not consistent , anger is the inevitable result , " he said			0
" so yes , many will be angry			0
" indeed , conservative commentator @entity196 , hosting @entity198 's talk - radio show on tuesday , said he 's heard " pretty credibly " that conservatives have 25 of the 29 votes they need to oppose @entity0 and at least send the speaker race to a second round			1
and he urged some of the incoming @entity5 freshmen to join the cause			0
" many of these guys ran saying , ' i oppose @entity0 — are they actually going to stand up now " and vote against him , @entity196 asked			0
" i think this could undermine the leadership — and i think that 's a good thing			0
" and @entity214 host @entity213 amplified the calls for a coup in a tuesday statement to @entity218 , declaring that it 's " time for new dynamic leadership " in the @entity6 and naming @entity222 rep. @entity221 , the chairman of the @entity6 select committee investigating the @entity225 attacks , as his pick			1
@entity221 , however , quickly declined , underscoring the problem conservatives have encountered time and time again when attempting to overthrow @entity0 — they 've found no clear alternative to run against him			0
and many conservatives came out tuesday offering their full support for @entity18 , including @entity233 rep. @entity232 , and @entity0 's allies say they remain confident he 'll be fine in the election			1
" these guys thrive on making trouble , " @entity65 said of conservatives , " but i do n't think @entity0 's ever been stronger within the conference			2
" but @entity5 on @entity240 admit the next week could make or break both @entity0 and the @entity5 's chance at starting off the new @entity11 , and the path to the 2016 elections , on the right foot			1
" maybe after this week [ a challenge to his speakership ] could be a more serious conversation — but everybody i 've talked to seems to think he 's in a very solid shape , " the @entity6 @entity5 aide said			1
but the aide added : " it just depends on how @entity18 does			0
@entity0 has kind of , in a way , tied himself to @entity18 now			2
" the fallout : what you need to know			0

back - to - back scandals for @entity6 @entity5 this week underscored their challenges in the new @entity11
house speaker @entity0 is facing calls for a coup that have grown louder
@entity0 's support of rep. @entity18 is necessary for his *survival* , but could hurt the @entity5 brand
