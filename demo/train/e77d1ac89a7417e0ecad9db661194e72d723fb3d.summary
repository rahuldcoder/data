-- @entity1 is en vogue at the moment			1
its parliament has backed gay marriage , " @entity10 " has taken the movie world by storm , @entity4 's is launching the " @entity13 " @entity11 and @entity12 has jetted in to join the @entity14 at @entity15			0
vive le @entity1 ? not so for those earning more than $ 1.3 million a year , especially after @entity18 president @entity17 announced he would introduce a top income tax rate of 75 %			1
it has become a real point of contention , with some -- including top sports stars -- threatening to move abroad			1
@entity24 ditches @entity1 for @entity26 's @entity25 renowned actor @entity24 has already taken up the offer of @entity25 citizenship , despite @entity1 's constitutional court vetoing @entity17 's proposal			1
but while the plans over taxation are on hold , those involved with the nation 's football are worried that their star assets are heading to the @entity38 and abroad to seek sanctuary			2
" what you see is that @entity1 football loses good players , all leaving for @entity47 , so the @entity48 will be above all the other leagues , " @entity41 manager @entity40 told reporters			1
" in @entity1 , because of the financial side , we will have to work on young players or with recruits not well known , and then we 'll make them big , and they 'll go to @entity47 again			1
we are entering this ' cycle			0
' " during the january transfer window , international striker @entity54 left @entity1 title contender @entity41 to move to @entity57 , a club which was bottom of the @entity48 and threatened with relegation			1
@entity61 's middle men eye rich pickings in transfer window even more remarkably in january , no less than five @entity1 made the switch to @entity65 , a move which led to the hanging of the " @entity68 " in the @entity48 club 's canteen			1
@entity72 's @entity71 , @entity74 's @entity73 , @entity75 from @entity76 , @entity78 's @entity77 and @entity80 's @entity79 all made the move to the north east of @entity47			1
they should feel at home as there 's already more than a hint of @entity88 flair at @entity89 , with the wonderfully talented pair of @entity91 and @entity92 at the club , as well as the likes of @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97			2
" i 'm not surprised that they want to play there because it 's the best league , but i am surprised by just how many @entity1 players have gone there at the same time , " former @entity65 and @entity1 player @entity98 told @entity0			1
however , @entity98 insisted that financial motivation was not the reason for this footballing exodus to @entity65			1
" tax is not a big factor			2
the biggest draw is the chance to play in front of packed stadia every week , " he said			0
" it 's the place where all players want to play			0
when the @entity1 players come back to @entity1 after a spell in @entity47 , they all talk about how great it is			1
" it 's professional , it has great fans and atmosphere and it 's where all the best players are			0
i loved it at @entity65			1
the fans and people of the north east are so friendly and full of warmth			0
" @entity131 has a point on taxes in the last @entity1 election , held in may 2012 -- the @entity1 population in @entity136 was given the opportunity to vote on the establishment of a parliamentary member for @entity140			1
there are 120,000 officially registered as living in the @entity38 capital , but one of those -- politician @entity144 -- believes the total is nearer 400,000			0
before winning that parliamentary ballot , as a representative of @entity17 's @entity147 , @entity144 lived and worked in @entity136 for 12 years			0
" many people come and go between the two countries thanks to the new transport links and there are a lot of younger people who come to @entity136 and move on afterwards , " she told @entity0			0
" i arrived in @entity136 12 years ago and i remember reading the headlines in the newspapers then about how @entity1 people were moving for tax reasons			1
" but the reality is very different			0
even now there is a lot being written about people leaving because of the 75 % tax reasons			2
i 've not seen any serious figures supporting this			0
the reality is very different			0
" people come here for a whole variety of reasons : to study , to work , to learn @entity47 , for love , for the international dimension of the @entity38			1
" taxes , at the end , are pretty similar in the two countries , and constitute very rarely a reason to move out			2
" it has become more and more normal to spend some time in your career or to study abroad			2
" some stay and some leave after a while			0
sometimes , bi-national couples move to @entity1 if they have a second child because the cost of living is expensive here			1
" why @entity24 's ' pathetic ' desertion has caused @entity1 storm @entity144 also doubts that recent raft of @entity1 arrivals at @entity65 has anything to do with the levels of tax in their own country			1
" i think it 's a misconception to say they 're here because of taxes , " she said			1
" these players are young and earning their first big contract in a very good club and that 's a great opportunity for them			2
" ' i do n't think they 've thought to themselves , ' i want to leave for tax reasons			2
' " dubbed " @entity204 " by the @entity1 media , @entity65 is in many ways no different from many other @entity48 clubs in luring talent from across the @entity208			1
the likes of @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215 are just some of those to enjoy huge success in @entity47			1
while the typical @entity47 football fan might refer to the @entity1 as " @entity220 " and take pleasure in mentioning the military victories at @entity223 and @entity224 , the acceptance of @entity1 talent on the football field has never been in doubt			1
one @entity1 who made the move to @entity47 and then to @entity65 was football writer @entity230 , who believes the most difficult task facing his fellow countrymen is understanding the locals ' notorious " @entity235 " accent			1
" there was indeed a bit of a linguistic shock , " @entity230 recalled following his arrival in the city			0
" i 'd say that a true , thick @entity235 accent is more difficult to understand than a broad @entity243 brogue , which in itself can be pretty challenging			0
" i just could n't understand our next door neighbor and my partner , who is herself a @entity235 , also had great trouble			0
" it really can be challenging but by and large , most locals speak with a mild @entity235 accent , thank @entity252			0
that or i 've got so used to it that i do n't notice anymore			0
" while it might take time for the newcomers to adapt to the local lingo and swap their @entity258 for a pint of @entity260 , @entity230 believes the recent arrivals will enjoy life in the city			0
" @entity65 's stock as a city has risen tremendously in the last decade , " he added			1
" it 's now seen as a vibrant , party - going and sexy place , but it was a very different story 10 years earlier with the demise of the mines and shipyards and the @entity274 riots in 1991			0
" @entity275 , now @entity65 's nightlife epicenter -- revamped and regenerated -- was a mess back then			2
" @entity12 to donate @entity15 wages to children 's charity back in @entity1 the arrival of a world superstar in @entity12 at @entity15 has helped softened the blow of so many departing @entity1 players			2
the midfielder signed a five - month deal with @entity15 last month and has pledged to donate his salary to a children 's charity within the city			0
and while worries persist over the numbers of young @entity1 players moving aboard , @entity12 arrives at a time where big - name foreign players are playing a starring role in @entity296			2
backed by its @entity298 - based owners , @entity15 recently paid out $ 52.8 million for young @entity300 @entity299 after securing a $ 72 million deal for @entity302 and defender @entity303 from @entity304 last july			2
the club has qualified for the quarterfinals of the @entity307 and leads the domestic title race			0
" i am very glad , " @entity144 said of @entity12 's arrival in the @entity1 capital			2
" i think that it 's great that he decided to move to @entity313 and to donate his wages to charity			0
it 's a very good example			0
" it also shows that @entity313 is a good club and an attractive city			0
