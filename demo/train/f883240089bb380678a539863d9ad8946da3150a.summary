-- the iconic image of the neighborhood drugstore and wise and friendly pharmacist were once part of the @entity6 social fabric			0
the local pharmacy was where we went to pursue romance over an ice cream soda , share gossip with members of our community or acquire our most basic supplies			0
pharmacists were our friends , our neighbors and those we looked to for help and aid			0
but increasingly , as the local pharmacy transformed into the large chain drug store , the analgesics and advice were joined by something quite different and deadly : tobacco products			1
along with medicines , greeting cards and cosmetics , large retailers and pharmacies like @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 sell cigarettes and other tobacco products , despite the fact that we know they are harmful			1
but on wednesday , @entity39 / @entity38 stepped up and declared loud and clear : cigarettes and health care can not and should not coexist under the same roof			1
we applaud @entity39 for taking the bold and socially conscious step to stop selling cigarettes and other tobacco products effective october 1			1
more than 7,600 cvs stores across the nation will no longer sell these products -- impacting thousands of customers across the country and helping to promote longer , healthier lives			2
despite intense competition in the industry , @entity39 had the vision and the conviction to do what is right for its customers			1
each year in our country , more than 480,000 @entity6 lose their lives to tobacco - related diseases , including heart disease , cancers , emphysema and stroke			0
tobacco use also takes a huge toll on our economy , from lost productivity to the medical care costs of treating sick smokers			2
but tobacco - related disease is wholly preventable			0
proven tactics such as raising the price of tobacco products , clean indoor air laws , and effective public education campaigns can help drive smoking rates down			1
for years , these have been the tools of government and nonprofit organizations like @entity82			0
@entity39 brought a critical additional tool to bear -- limiting access to tobacco -- and issued a clarion call for retailers to join the fight to change the culture around tobacco use to make it less socially acceptable			1
removing tobacco products from pharmacy shelves -- where they are often both an eye - level temptation for youth who are open to smoking and a trigger for smokers struggling to quit -- will help foster positive changes in our attitudes toward smoking			1
we challenge other large retailers to take the same step and put their customers ' health and well - being ahead of their profit margins			2
@entity39 's decision shows that the for - profit sector can truly do good			2
increasingly , @entity6 's pharmacies are positioning themselves as health care providers			1
instead of a traditional visit to a doctor 's office , many people may now visit their pharmacy -- like @entity39 's @entity118 -- for a quick assessment or diagnosis or to receive an on - the - spot prescription for whatever ails			2
to be seen as trusted health care providers , pharmacies must reconcile the inherent contradiction of offering those services while also selling lethal tobacco products to those very same customers			1
providing medical services in one part of the store while offering harmful products at the cash register is a paradox that could n't be clearer			0
@entity39 recognized that to be a true leader , you have to not only talk the talk but walk the walk			0
in a business climate with brutal competition and the persistent pressure to deliver short - term results , estimates are that this move by @entity39 could cost the nation 's second largest drugstore chain about $ 2 billion in annual sales			1
but smart businesses look toward the big picture			0
by taking tobacco products off its shelves , @entity39 has an immediate opportunity to introduce other -- potentially profitable -- product lines to its customer base			1
with a new commitment to offering customers healthier choices , it has a longer - term opportunity to foster relationships with health care providers and medical staff -- all synched with @entity39 's vision to be a trusted neighborhood resource for short - term care			1
and @entity39 's act of social responsibility also has the potential to deepen existing customer relationships			0
already , anecdotally , i 've heard colleagues and friends who have been affected firsthand by the issue of tobacco use or lost a loved one to tobacco - related disease say to me , " @entity39 is now my pharmacy for life " -- based on the action it took this week			2
for that , the public health community and the chain 's customers are cheering			0
we hope its peers quickly follow suit			0
once they do , we will likely reach our bold goal to reduce smoking prevalence in the @entity6 to under 10 % in the next 10 years			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity190 .			0
