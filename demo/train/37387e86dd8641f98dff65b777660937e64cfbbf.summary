-- for more than 50 years , the @entity1 has had an embargo against the island of @entity4 , all because we supposedly hate communism and believe the nation 90 miles from our borders should institute democracy			1
as the @entity12 candidates battle it out for votes in @entity16 's primary election on tuesday , the subject of @entity4 has come up in a couple of debates			1
nearly all the candidates , except for @entity21 rep. @entity20 , have sounded ridiculous trying to defend what is clearly a failed policy , all in an effort to curry favor among the large population of @entity4 voters in the state			1
take , for instance , @entity30			0
the former speaker of the @entity32 was his usual fire - breathing self in the @entity36 - @entity35 debate when he called on the @entity1 to authorize regime change to get @entity39 and @entity38 out of their positions as leaders of the country			1
" i would suggest to you the policy of the @entity1 should be aggressively to overthrow the regime and to do everything we can to support those @entity4 who want freedom , " @entity44 said			1
" you know , @entity51 is very infatuated with an @entity53			0
he does n't seem to be able to look 90 miles south of the @entity1 to have a @entity4 @entity53			1
" so i would try to put in place a very aggressive policy of reaching out to every single @entity4 who would like to be free , helping network them together , reaching out to the younger generation inside the dictatorship , and indicating they do n't have a future as a dictatorship because a @entity44 presidency will not tolerate four more years of this dictatorship			1
" in what was the most ridiculous comment of the night , former @entity67 sen. @entity66 said that if @entity4 were @entity69 in terms of its geographical proximity to the @entity1 , he would be just as against the country			1
" this is an important doctrine of the @entity1 to make sure that our hemisphere and those who are close to us are — are folks that we can and should deal with , " @entity66 said			1
" and right now , we have and have had for 50 years a dictatorship in @entity4			2
we 've had sanctions on them			0
they should continue until the @entity84 are dead , and then we should make it very clear that if you want mountains of aid , if you want normal relationships , if you want to improve your economy , if you want to have the opportunity for freedom , that the @entity1 stands ready now to embrace you now that you 've gotten rid of these tyrants who — who have controlled you for these 50 - plus years			2
that 's why the sanctions have to stay in place , because we need to have a — a very solid offer to come forward and help the @entity4 people			1
" seriously ? is it possible for us to have a grown - folks conversation here ? there is no logical reason that candidates should deplore normalizing relations with @entity4 , while we do whatever we can to help @entity69			1
hmmm , let 's see			2
@entity4 is a communist country			2
@entity69 is a communist country			0
the people of @entity4 are n't living in a democratic system			2
the people of @entity69 are n't living in a democratic system			0
yet @entity69 has been granted most favored nation status , allowing the free flow of goods back and forth			0
sorry , @entity66 , that has nothing to do with proximity			0
it 's all about @entity69 being a great outpost for @entity1 businesses , and the fact that the communist country is essentially the banker of @entity1 , owning hundreds of billions of dollars of our debt			1
@entity66 wants to suggest that @entity4 is in bed with @entity126 and @entity127 , and they are in alignment with @entity130 , helping potential terrorists			2
last i checked , we have relations with @entity135 , and they do huge business with @entity130			0
we despise @entity137 , yet @entity69 does a lot of business with @entity137			0
folks , i 'm fully supportive of democracy , and we should be preaching that gospel wherever we go			0
but there is no way i can believe that thawing our relationship with @entity4 will somehow harm @entity1			1
the @entity4 - @entity1 community is loud , has major political clout and writes big checks , mainly to the @entity12			1
but surely it 's time for the adults to admit that the embargo has not forced @entity38 out of office , and all it has done is give him the best bogeyman he could get when talking to @entity4 citizens			1
the @entity1 should step up and end the embargo against @entity4 and recognize that having real and substantive relationships with the nation could spur the democracy we say we want			1
" i think it 's time ... to quit this isolation business of not talking to people , " @entity20 said			1
" we talked to the @entity162			0
we talk to the @entity69			0
and we opened up trade , and we 're not killing each other now			0
we fought with the @entity165 for a long time			0
we finally gave up , started talking to them , now we trade with them			0
i do n't know why — why the @entity4 people should be so intimidating			2
" i think we 're living in the dark ages when we ca n't even talk to the @entity4 people			2
i think it 's not 1962 anymore			0
and we do n't have to use force and intimidation and overthrow of a — in governments			0
i just do n't think that 's going to work			0
" it 's time that the @entity12 candidates and officials in both parties stop the political pandering to @entity182 and say that if we want a free @entity4 , it can begin with ending a senseless and failed embargo			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity187 .			2

@entity187 notes @entity4 has come up as issue in @entity12 primary race
the candidates have looked silly defending @entity1 's failed @entity4 policy , he says
@entity187 says only @entity20 has the right idea about @entity4
