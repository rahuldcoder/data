@entity0 , @entity1 -- as chairman of @entity5 , @entity3 is used to making things that move at breakneck speed			1
but rather than flashy sports cars for wealthy motor enthusiasts , the @entity1 businessman 's latest high - velocity project aims to cater for the traveling masses			1
the @entity14 train from @entity14 -- a passenger rail company of which @entity3 is also chairman -- is a high - speed service that has been dashing between @entity17 , @entity0 and other major @entity1 cities since april			1
with its dark red color scheme , streamlined shape and speeds as fast as a formula - one car , everyone 's calling @entity14 the " @entity5 train			1
" a cinema carriage , free @entity29 access throughout the train , and luxury leather seats all add to the high - performance , luxury theme			2
but @entity14 is intended to be affordable and accessible to all consumers			0
both @entity14 and state - run rival @entity35 currently have promotional offers , but @entity35 's flexible standard tickets from @entity0 to @entity17 start from $ 107 and go up to $ 200 , whereas flexible standard tickets from @entity0 to @entity17 on @entity14 range from $ 110 to $ 163			1
" our idea was to do a train for everybody , " @entity3 says			0
see also : in numbers : @entity47 's high - speed trains he believes rail is the best way to travel in @entity47 and sees the emergence of @entity14 as a sign of rail renaissance			1
" there are other trains in @entity47 but for me high - speed train will be the future of @entity47 , " he says			1
while @entity1 has had high - speed trains since the late 1970s , @entity14 is the country 's first rail operator not run by the state			1
@entity3 and his consortium of partners , including @entity65 state rail company @entity64 , have invested â ‚ ¬ 1 billion ( $ 1.2 billion ) in @entity14 , breaking @entity35 's monopoly			1

" it 's an opportunity for the consumer , " says @entity35 's @entity76			0
" it 's an opportunity for us to really demonstrate the power of @entity35 and @entity71 ... and i think our numbers are really unbeatable			0
we are the first high - speed train in @entity1 ... we served 25 million consumers in the last year and i think our numbers are unbeatable			1
" @entity85 , vice president of rail industry technology specialists @entity86 , agrees that competition in the sector can benefit the consumer			0
" privatization and competition drives more efficient businesses , " he says			0
" with more efficient businesses those benefits and savings can be passed on to customers			0
so service gets better , product gets better and pricing gets better			0
" the expansion of other rail operators across @entity47 is having a similar effect , says @entity85			2
" competition is driving a customer approach to rail ... and not just in @entity1 , " he says			2
" we can see that with ( @entity108 rail company ) @entity106 announcing they 're coming into @entity109 to compete with @entity110			2
