-- @entity2 's preparations for a major international soccer tournament have been hit by " human error " and heavy rain , which caused the roof of @entity8 's host stadium to partially collapse			1
the @entity9 is due to host three matches in the eight - nation @entity11 , considered a warmup for the @entity13 also in @entity2 , with the first to be played on june 20			1
but stadium administrators now face major repairs after a triangular tear appeared in one section of the roof on monday as it buckled under the weight of rain water			1
the @entity21 ( @entity22 ) group , which manages the stadium , said in a statement : " the breakup of a part of the 36 panels of the roof membrane was ( caused ) by human error			1
" the @entity22 checked the sealing cover the previous day , taking advantage of the non-operation of the @entity34 stadium			0
" during this procedure a portion of the membrane covering the metal deck was bent , which eventually became a barrier , causing an accumulation of rain water which prevented the correct outlets for drainage			0
" @entity0 affiliate @entity44 showed aerial images of the stadium staff using buckets to remove pools of water from other sections of the roof to try to prevent further collapses			1
@entity22 said repair work was already under way and that the stadium would be ready for its first @entity11 match , a @entity58 tie between @entity59 and @entity60			2
it added that the roof structure of the @entity9 arena had passed resistance tests , and stressed that this was an isolated incident			0
however , it confirmed it would now carry out a major inspection of the stadium			0
the arena , in the north - east city of @entity8 , was the third purpose - built stadium to be inaugurated ahead of the @entity13 in @entity2			1
it will host six games during the world football 's prestigious event and won praise when it passed its official test event last month			2
but the partial roof collapse is the type of public relations disaster @entity2 is desperate to avoid			2
the @entity79 country is already drawing extra global scrutiny as it hosts back - to - back major sporting events , with the @entity82 in @entity83 following next year 's @entity13			2
@entity83 's @entity85 stadium , considered a cathedral of world football , finally reopened last month after a two - year , $ 500 million renovation			0
but the @entity89 in @entity83 , which is due to host the track and field events at the @entity91 and is also home to @entity94 football club , has been closed indefinitely after it was found to have major structural flaws			0
the @entity11 will also be a trial run of infrastructure -- from hotels to airports and urban transport			0
more than half a million tickets have already been sold and many fans will want to travel from one city to another to follow their team			0
the @entity11 pits continental champions against each other , with world champions @entity108 among the teams joining hosts @entity2			1
for football fans it is a chance to savor some end - of - season international action , but for @entity2 -- which last staged the @entity13 in 1950 -- it is a chance to prove it can again host a major sporting spectacle .			1
