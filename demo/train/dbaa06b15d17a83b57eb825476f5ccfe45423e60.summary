in the city of @entity1 , on @entity3 's border with @entity4 , neither the forces of the @entity3 regime nor the rebels of the @entity8 are to be seen			1
but visitors say the @entity11 flag is very evident , and @entity11 fighters man checkpoints around the city			1
more are being trained in the @entity11 region of neighboring @entity16			0
away from the epicenter of the battle for @entity3 , the @entity11 minority -- about 10 % of the @entity3 population -- has gained control of two areas			1
one is around @entity1 , which has a population of nearly 200,000 ; the other is north of @entity25 in towns like @entity27 and @entity28			0
they have one aim , best summed up by a poster at a recent rally that read : " @entity32 ( sic ) is the best solution for new @entity3			0
" @entity3 's @entity34 do not live in one region , unlike @entity16 's			1
they are scattered across northern @entity3			1
but their growing if patchy autonomy promises to be a source of friction with other @entity3 groups in the months ahead , and may have seismic consequences for @entity4 , @entity16 and even @entity42			1
when the unrest began in @entity3 last year , most @entity34 remained on the sidelines			1
as a minority , they feared the emergence of a @entity3 dominated by @entity47			0
and the main @entity11 group -- the @entity49 , or @entity49 -- was useful to the regime			1
it has long been ( and remains ) an affiliate of the @entity52 , the militant group in @entity4 that has fought for @entity11 autonomy for three decades , a struggle that has claimed tens of thousands of lives			1
" the @entity52 has always had very good connections with the @entity34 and especially with the @entity49 , " said @entity4 journalist @entity56 , who has followed the @entity11 story for decades			1
" @entity59 have been killed by @entity4 security forces in battles with the @entity52 , " he said			1
the @entity52 claims some 3,500 of its " martyrs " have been @entity3			1
so the @entity49 was a tool with which the @entity65 regime could threaten the @entity4 should they interfere in events inside @entity3 , said @entity67 of the @entity68			1
" @entity65 wants to make it difficult for the @entity4 to intervene without getting into a war with the @entity52 , and unlike @entity16 and @entity42 , the @entity52 has real grass - roots support in @entity3 , " @entity67 told @entity69			1
for both @entity65 and the @entity49 it was an opportunistic relationship			1
intelligence sources in the region say the regime even allowed several hundred @entity11 militants back into the country from the @entity79 in the far northeastern corner of @entity16 , including the group 's leader , @entity81			2
there were also reports that @entity49 militia were deployed to stifle anti-regime protests by @entity11 youth groups			1
then -- in october 2011 -- a prominent @entity3 @entity11 activist , @entity87 , was assassinated			2
many @entity34 blamed the regime for his murder			0
the @entity49 may have feared that any association with the regime -- and lingering suspicions it may have been complicit in @entity87 's murder -- would harm its credibility			0
it vehemently denied involvement , but has since begun to forge a " third way , " backing neither the government nor the rebels but using the vacuum of authority to carve out a zone of control			0
@entity49 leader @entity81 told the @entity106 - based @entity105 blog last year : " what is important is that we @entity34 assert our existence			2
the current regime does not accept us , nor do those who will potentially come into power			0
" in july , @entity65 's security forces suddenly relinquished control of several @entity11 towns			1
@entity116 of the @entity117 said that whether they did so voluntarily to focus on other places or were " told " to leave -- as the @entity49 insists -- is unclear			0
the effect was the same : alarm in @entity4 , already at war with the @entity52 in the mountains along the @entity16 border			2
" as the @entity4 see it , with identical @entity52 / @entity49 flags reportedly being raised over @entity28 - ' @entity129 and @entity27 , developments suggest that the @entity52 may be creating a safe haven for itself on @entity4 's border with @entity3 , " @entity67 wrote last month on @entity69 's @entity125			1
@entity4 prime minister @entity132 warns that any attempt by the @entity52 -- which is designated a terrorist organization by both the @entity135 and @entity136 -- to launch cross-border attacks would be met by force			2
the @entity4 army underlined that warning with a large exercise less than a mile from border villages now controlled by the @entity49			2
the @entity135 has chimed in with its own concerns			0
secretary of state @entity143 said : " we share @entity4 's determination that @entity3 must not become a haven for @entity52 terrorists whether now or after the departure of the @entity65 regime			1
" " that could be a big disaster for @entity4 , not now but maybe in two years , " @entity56 said			0
" @entity4 can never accept the @entity52 controlling the @entity3 side of the border			1
it is highly possible the @entity4 military would intervene in @entity3			2
" the picture is complicated by a brewing battle for supremacy among @entity3 's @entity34			2
the @entity49 is now being challenged by a loose coalition known as the @entity158			0
the group , although riven by internal disputes , is sponsored by the @entity16 @entity11 leader @entity161			0
@entity67 , of the @entity68 , said @entity161 has tried to bring the @entity49 and @entity158 together , but evidence suggests little co-operation and plenty of rivalry			0
according to @entity116 , who has traveled widely in the region for the @entity117 , there is a real risk of conflict between @entity11 factions for control of @entity1 in coming months			0
it is where the @entity158 is strongest , but the @entity49 has been making inroads , and there have already been clashes between supporters of the two groups , she said			0
@entity116 said that hundreds of @entity34 -- some of them defectors from the army -- are receiving military training in @entity16			0
so far it appears they have been unable to return to @entity3			0
@entity161 , a veteran @entity11 nationalist , clearly wants to influence events in @entity3 , but at the same time he realizes that @entity4 is important as a route for oil exports from @entity16 @entity190			1
he has no wish to antagonize @entity192 , and may even help by trying to " box in " the @entity49			0
@entity4 foreign minister @entity195 recently called on @entity161 in @entity196 , and they " emphasized that any attempt to exploit the power vacuum by any violent group or organization ( in @entity3 ) will be considered as a common threat , " a not - so - veiled warning to the @entity49			1
another element in this explosive regional equation is the strained relationship between the @entity16 @entity34 and @entity16 's central government			0
the @entity34 are increasingly at odds with the @entity209 government led by @entity210 in @entity211 , and so is @entity4 , according to @entity67			2
reports from the border area say the @entity11 peshmerga patrolling the @entity3 border are sometimes just a few hundred yards from regular @entity16 troops			2
however the @entity3 revolt unfolds , " the experience of the @entity34 will have an influence on @entity42 's @entity34 and @entity4 's @entity11 population , " said @entity56 , who is a senior correspondent for the @entity219 newspaper			1
for the @entity52 , @entity3 provides an opportunity -- and possibly another front against @entity4 's military			1
@entity56 sees that as adding a new dynamic to @entity4 politics			0
" the @entity4 state has to deal with the @entity52 in a political way by persuading it to disarm , " he told @entity69			2
" this will be very difficult , as previous conflicts such as @entity233 have shown			0
but the @entity4 military can not defeat the @entity52			2
" he added that , " according to conventional wisdom , this is not the time to begin such a political initiative , with presidential elections due in 2014			0
but we must solve this question as soon as possible or there will be a catastrophe			0
" @entity67 agrees that as a new constitution is written in @entity4 , the @entity11 issue must be tackled			2
@entity4 's @entity34 , he says , may soon look around the region and see that their brethren in @entity3 and @entity16 are better off			1
it 's widely assumed that @entity132 will run for the presidency in 2014			0
@entity67 describes him as " the most powerful elected leader @entity4 has ever had , and he has an opportunity to address the @entity11 issue " by advancing autonomy for @entity4 's 14 million @entity34			1
but for @entity4 's substantial nationalist vote , that may be a bridge too far .			0

@entity11 fighters have gained control over areas of northern @entity3
the main @entity11 group , the @entity49 , has been seen as useful to the @entity65 regime
it has close ties to the @entity52 , the group fighting in @entity4 for @entity11 autonomy
the @entity34 ' experience will influence other @entity11 groups , an *analyst* says
