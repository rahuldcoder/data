ireport.com : reaction to @entity15 family tragedy the tragedy is a sad turn for the 27 - year - old actress and singer , who first earned national notice for her performances on " @entity57 " in 2004 and won an @entity58 for best supporting actress for 2006 's " dreamgirls			1
" @entity15 's singing career began in her church choir in the @entity27 neighborhood of @entity65 when she was a child			1
she remained devoted to singing all the way through @entity27 's @entity69 , where there is now a @entity71			1
( she 's in good company ; @entity74 's alumni include @entity75 and two of the @entity77			2
) " people would say it was unusual for such a small girl to have such a big voice , " she told @entity78 in 2006			0
" they would say , ' she sounds like she 's grown			0
' " after finishing school , she performed in the musical " @entity83 " at a @entity27 - area dinner theater and took a job on a cruise line			1
in 2003 , she auditioned for " @entity57 " in @entity87 , @entity88 , and managed to earn her way to the top - rated show with a performance of " @entity92 , " the " hair " ballad popularized by @entity94			1
" idol " proved to be an uneven experience for @entity15			1
after the show narrowed down its 12 finalists , she started slowly , at times almost being voted off , but eventually her song choices -- including @entity102 's " @entity101 " and @entity103 's " @entity104 " -- made her one of the favorites			0
sir @entity102 himself believed she was the " best of the lot			0
" ' @entity57 ' friend speaks out about @entity15 case in the end , @entity15 did n't even come close to making " @entity57 's " final two , being voted off midway in the show 's run			1
however , her performances had established her as a talent to watch , and in may 2005 -- several months after finishing the traditional post- " idol " group tour -- she was contacted by a casting agency about the part of @entity120 , the tragic soul of " dreamgirls			0
" in the musical , which concerns an all - girl trio much like the @entity125 , @entity120 is a weight - challenged musical powerhouse who begins as the group 's leader but is dropped as both performer and lover by the group 's manager for the more statuesque singer @entity134			2
the role features the musical 's showstopping song , " @entity138 , " and won @entity139 a @entity140 when " @entity142 " ran on @entity141			1
@entity15 was unfamiliar with " @entity142 " when she auditioned , but she allegedly beat out almost 800 other women for the role -- including her former " idol " rival , @entity145 , who had been the third - season winner			1
the role 's high - pitched emotions were a challenge , @entity15 told the @entity150 in 2006			1
" i had to find a way into it , " she said to the newspaper			0
" [ director ] @entity155 sent me into ' @entity156			0
' he told me i was too nice			0
so i 'd come into the room angry , but tell all the ads , ' @entity155 told me to do this			0
this is @entity120 and not @entity2			2
' i had to learn how to separate myself from the character with that attitude			0
that was @entity155 's main concern			0
@entity120 had to have that edge			0
" her performance won her across - the - board raves			0
@entity168 compared her turn to @entity171 's award - winning debut in " @entity172 , " among others			2
it also led to a host of awards , including supporting actress honors from the @entity178 , @entity179 , the @entity180 and -- finally -- the @entity58			0
at the @entity58 show , @entity15 tearfully thanked her grandmother , whom she described as her " biggest inspiration			2
" @entity184 , who sang at @entity185 , where @entity15 got her start , died in 1998			2
since winning the @entity58 , @entity15 has been a mainstay of celebrity magazines , which have broadcast news of her engagement to " @entity191 " contestant @entity192 , regularly singled her out as an example of a healthy plus - sized body type and held her up as an " idol " made good			1
she 's continued her movie career with performances in " @entity198 : @entity201 " and " @entity13 , " both of which came out in 2008			0
she sang the national anthem at the @entity203 in august at the personal request of sen. @entity206 's campaign			2
according to many reports , @entity15 has remained humble amid all the attention			2
she remains devoted to the church -- " church is where i 'm from			0
it will always be my favorite place to sing , and that 's where i 'd like to go back to , " @entity15 told the @entity150 -- and uses her against - all - odds biography to inspire others			1
" i 've had a similar journey as @entity120 , " @entity15 told the @entity150			2
" me being a part of ' @entity57 , ' her being part of the group			2
