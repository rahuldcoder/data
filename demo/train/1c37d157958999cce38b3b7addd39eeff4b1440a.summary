-- @entity1 , a 36 - year - old undocumented immigrant in @entity2 , has held two lifelong dreams : to become a @entity5 citizen and to practice law			1
he 's been waiting 19 years for a visa still stuck in a backlog , but the @entity2 @entity9 ensured this week that his second dream will become a reality			1
@entity1 can be admitted to @entity2 's state bar and legally practice as a lawyer there , the court ruled			1
" i 'm super excited to finally be able to fulfill one of my dreams , " @entity1 told @entity0 friday			2
court : undocumented immigrant can be lawyer but the case raises many questions , particularly among those who have been critical of @entity1 's efforts to practice law			1
they question how someone who is in the country without legal status can be licensed to uphold the law as an attorney			0
@entity1 says that this an easy initial response to make but that looking at the details of his case , it is not so clear - cut			2
he was brought to the @entity5 as a minor and has been in line for 19 years for a green card			0
if anyone feels frustrated the the situation , they should address it with the federal government , @entity1 said			2
it 's the immigration system that 's broken , he said			0
@entity1 was born in @entity44 in 1977 and taken to @entity2 by his parents when he was 17 months old , according to court documents			1
he remained there until 1986 , when he and his parents returned to @entity44			0
eight years later , at age 17 , @entity1 again returned to @entity2 with his parents and without documentation , though his father had obtained permanent resident status in the @entity5			1
that year , @entity1 's father filed an immigration visa petition on his son 's behalf , which federal immigration officials accepted in 1995			2
the visa still has not been granted , even though @entity1 has lived in the state since 1994			0
@entity2 's @entity9 ruled thursday ( @entity59 ) that no state law or public policy should stop @entity1 or others like him from obtaining a law license in the state			1
asked why he did n't choose a different career or pursue other opportunities , @entity1 said law was his singular focus			1
" i was n't smart and put all my eggs into one basket , " he said			0
" this whole idea of being an attorney was the only idea i had going , so 20 years of working on that dream , i could n't really afford to give up on it			0
" " that , and i 'm a little bit stubborn , anyway , " @entity1 added			0
now that he has a law license , however , one thing that @entity1 will not specialize in is immigration law			1
" oh , no , that 's just too messed up , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity80 and @entity81 contributed to this report .			0
