only 25 % of those surveyed said they viewed @entity4 as " good " or " very good , " while 72 % said they viewed the @entity57 positively			2
" i think with @entity4 , it 's a question of trust as to what are they up to , and what are their nuclear objectives , " @entity138 said			2
@entity18 's ' direct , personal role ' experts say @entity4 has been building relations in @entity14 for decades			1

@entity197 made his first official visit to @entity4 in 2001			0

... @entity18 himself has played a very direct , personal role in that process , " said @entity206 , who researched @entity4 's alliances as part of his work as senior adviser for @entity212 initiatives at the @entity213			1
and it 's no coincidence that @entity11 will be @entity18 's first stop on his trip to the region -- his sixth as president			1
despite their cultural differences , the two nations have found significant common ground : both are among the world 's top crude oil exporters , and their leaders have become strong allies united by a fierce opposition to what they view as @entity57 imperialism			0
even as he announced last week that @entity18 's visit would go ahead as scheduled , @entity11 president @entity236 slammed the @entity57 , saying that " tensions in the @entity239 have been growing in recent hours because of @entity241 pressures , " state - run @entity235 reported			1

@entity18 's visit comes as those countries continue efforts to craft regional trade and political deals without @entity69 's influence			0
" the countries of @entity14 are saying to the world that they have sovereignty and independence			0
they are not subordinate to the dictates of the international polices of the @entity57 , " said @entity269 , a political science professor at the @entity270 in @entity28			0
and now , with the specter of increased @entity57 and @entity276 sanctions looming , @entity4 has an even deeper need to reach out , he said			0
" the visit by @entity18 to @entity11 and the rest of the countries reinforces on @entity4 's part that they are not isolated			1
they are demonstrating it publicly , " @entity269 said			0
on a practical level , analysts say @entity4 is likely looking for financial options			0
" it 's clear that @entity4 is being really hammered by the sanctions , and i think that what they 're really looking for in @entity14 is to develop ways to blunt the effects of the sanctions , particularly with the establishment of financial institutions that will allow them to move their money , " said @entity287 , a senior fellow at the @entity288			1
@entity69 's worries but when it comes to @entity4 , the @entity36 says there is no room for new deals			0
" we are making absolutely clear to countries around the world that now is not the time to be deepening ties -- not security ties , not economic ties -- with @entity4 , " @entity35 , the department 's spokeswoman , told reporters friday			0

and the @entity57 @entity334 sanctioned an @entity4 - owned bank in @entity28 in 2008			2
some @entity57 government officials and @entity69 analysts allege that @entity4 could be using new business relationships and energy deals with @entity14 countries as a cover for more illicit projects , such as training @entity344 militants and developing nuclear weapons			1
" @entity4 and its @entity350 allies ( @entity11 , @entity8 , @entity21 and @entity23 ) in @entity14 are systematically engaged in a pattern of financial behavior , recruitment exercises and business activities that are not economically rational and could be used for the movement and / or production of ( weapons of mass destruction ) and the furthering of @entity4 's stated aim of avoiding international sanctions on its nuclear program , " @entity346 wrote in a may 2011 report for the @entity348			1
@entity14 leaders have repeatedly stressed that any partnerships with @entity4 have peaceful purposes			1
@entity11 officials made light of @entity57 worries in a government statement describing one new @entity11 - @entity4 partnership in 2008 : " atomic " bicycles made at a new national factory			2
" the bicycles are known as ' atomic , ' in an ironic sense , as a response to the @entity57 ' constant attacks of @entity11 for its exchanges with @entity4 and the supposed transfer of uranium from our country to the @entity78 nation , " @entity11 's information ministry said in a statement accompanied by photos of @entity236 riding one of the bikes outside the factory			2
smoke and mirrors ? the realities of the relationships between @entity4 and its @entity14 allies are difficult to decipher , analysts say , because despite the large number of agreements trumpeted , information about the projects is often hard to come by			1
" half of them evaporate			0
they do n't become operational , " said @entity67 of the @entity68			0
@entity206 , of the @entity213 , said some of the deals may be " smoke and mirrors			0
" " there 's often a lot less happening than the volume of activity would lead you to believe			0
but it is the case that we have seen these substantial increases in trade relations			0
... that 's not an illusion , " he said			0
with so many unanswered questions , @entity57 officials will be keeping a close eye on this week 's trip , said @entity138 , of the @entity141			0
" it 's not an existential threat to the @entity57 , " he said , " but @entity4 's activities ( in @entity14 ) are something that they 're watching because of what they could develop into , not because of what they necessarily are today			1
there 's a lot we do n't know about them			0
" journalist @entity431 in @entity28 and @entity0 's @entity432 and @entity433 in @entity434 contributed to this report .			0
