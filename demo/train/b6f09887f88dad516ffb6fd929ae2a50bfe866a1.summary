-- if anyone here feels @entity3 and @entity4 should not be united in holy matrimony , speak now or forever hold your peace			1
well , guess who 's got a problem -- seven years later			0
author @entity10 , the woman who dreamed up the pair and turned them into two of the most recognized figures in literature , is now throwing cold water on the central romance in the gazillion - selling @entity18			1
@entity10 now says she should have paired @entity4 with @entity18 , instead of his bud @entity3			1

but @entity36 's @entity35 published excerpts of the interview in a front - page story , " jk admits @entity4 should have wed @entity18			1
" " i wrote the @entity42 relationship as a form of wish fulfillment			2
that 's how it was conceived , really , " @entity10 says in the interview			1
" for reasons that have very little to do with literature and far more to do with me clinging to the plot as i first imagined it , @entity4 ended up with @entity3			1
" " i know , i 'm sorry , " she adds			0
" i can hear the rage and fury it might cause some fans , but if i 'm absolutely honest , distance has given me perspective on that			0
it was a choice i made for very personal reasons , not for reasons of credibility			0
am i breaking people 's hearts by saying this ? i hope not			0
" and what did the fictional mrs. @entity3 have to say about all this ? she agrees ! " i think there are fans out there who know that too and who wonder whether @entity3 would have really been able to make her happy , " @entity28 says in the interview			1
say it is n't so , howled @entity18 fans on @entity75 ( which bills itself as the world 's no. 1 @entity18 site )			0
" what ? ? ? i am heartbroken ! , " commented someone named " ana			0
" " @entity3 and @entity4 's relationship is wonderful because it is far from perfect at the beginning of the series and slowly ( and ingeniously ) develops into my favorite couple in the whole series ! i could go on for days about why i love them			1
" but the we - told - you - so side also came out in force			0
" @entity4 deserved someone better			2
@entity3 would have been insecure and it would not have been a healthy relationship , " said a commenter who goes by the name " militant delusionalist			1
" " @entity18 had always said good things about @entity4 and both of them being powerful wizards and brought up as muggles would have made them compatible			2
" @entity4 meets @entity3 in the first book of the series , " @entity18 and the @entity103 , " when he and @entity18 save her from a mountain troll			1
we learned of the pair getting hitched in the epilogue of the seventh and final book -- " @entity18 and the @entity109 , " published in 2007			0

and they lived happily ever after ? not quite			0
not even before @entity10 delivered this latest bombshell			2
two years ago , she said she once considered offing @entity3 altogether			1
" funnily enough , i planned from the start that none of them would die			0
then midway through , which i think was a reflection that i was n't in a very happy place , i started thinking i might punish one of them off			0
out of sheer spite , " she says in a conversation with @entity124 for the dvd extra feature for " @entity109			0
" ( @entity129 , of course , played @entity18 in the movies			0
