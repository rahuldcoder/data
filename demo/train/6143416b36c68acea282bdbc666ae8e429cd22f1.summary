-- the @entity2 breached international law by executing a @entity5 national without having granted him consular access , the @entity1 said friday			1
@entity8 , in a statement , said she deeply regrets the execution of @entity10 , after a 5 - 4 decision by the @entity2 @entity12 denied him a stay of execution thursday night			1
" the execution of mr. @entity10 places the @entity2 in breach of international law , " said @entity8 , who is on an official mission in @entity5			1
" what the state of @entity20 has done in this case is imputable in law to the @entity2 and engages the @entity2 ' international responsibility			1
" @entity8 said @entity10 was not granted consular access , which -- as a foreign national -- was his right under @entity27 of the @entity28			1
the denial of access raises concerns about whether @entity10 got a fair trial , @entity8 said			1
@entity10 , who was convicted for the 1994 rape and murder of a 16 - year - old girl , was executed thursday evening by lethal injection in @entity20			1
federal officials , including the @entity39 administration , had tried to persuade @entity20 gov. @entity40 to delay the execution			2
" the secretary herself is quite disappointed in the outcome in this case , " said @entity43 spokeswoman @entity42 about secretary of state @entity44			0
" the @entity2 government sought a stay of @entity52 's execution in order to give the @entity54 time to act on the @entity56 , which would have provided @entity52 the judicial review required by international law			1
" @entity42 said the case underscores the importance of the act 's passage			0
" if we do n't protect the rights of non-americans in the @entity2 , we seriously risk reciprocal lack of access to our own citizens overseas , " she said			1
" i am sorry for everything i have done , " @entity10 said at the @entity69 facility before he was executed			1
" i have hurt a lot of people			0
let this be final and be done			0
i take the full blame for this			0
" @entity10 then shouted " @entity80 , " followed by " i 'm ready warden , let 's get the show on the road			2
" @entity5 condemned the execution , saying it violated an @entity83 ruling ordering the @entity2 to review capital convictions of @entity5 nationals			1
the @entity2 @entity12 earlier denied a stay of execution by 5 - 4 , despite pleas from the @entity39 administration and the @entity5 government to delay the execution			1
in an unsigned opinion by the majority , the court refused to delay the execution until @entity54 could pass pending legislation giving federal courts the authority to hear similar claims from foreign inmates			2
" we decline to follow the @entity2 ' suggestion of granting a stay to allow @entity10 to bring a claim based on hypothetical legislation when it can not even bring itself to say that his attempt to overturn his conviction has any prospect of success , " said the majority			1
in their dissent , the four justices , led by @entity112 , urged that @entity52 's execution be delayed			2
" it is difficult to see how the state 's interest in the immediate execution of an individual convicted of capital murder 16 years ago can outweigh the considerations that support additional delay , perhaps only until the end of the summer , " said @entity112 , who was supported by justices @entity115 , @entity117 , and @entity118			0
@entity128 , lead appellate attorney , said , " it is shameful that mr. @entity10 will pay the price for our inaction			2
the need for congressional action to restore our reputation and protect our citizens is more urgent than ever			0
" " this case was not just about one @entity5 national on death row in @entity20 , " @entity128 said in a statement			1
" the execution of mr. @entity10 violates the @entity2 ' treaty commitments , threatens the nation 's foreign policy interests , and undermines the safety of all @entity2 abroad			1
" the state 's @entity147 ruled that @entity10 did not deserve to have his death sentence commuted to life in prison without parole			2
the victim 's mother , @entity153 , had called for the execution to go ahead as planned			0
" a technicality does n't give anyone a right to come to this country and rape , torture and murder anyone , in this case my daughter , " she told @entity0 affiliate @entity156 in @entity158			0
" it 's been difficult for myself and her family members , " she added			0
" she certainly was taken away from us at a very young age			0
" @entity10 's lawyers argued the consulate access violation was more than a technicality			1
@entity128 told @entity0 that @entity5 officials would have ensured @entity52 would have had the most competent trial defense possible had they been able to speak with him immediately after he was arrested			2
" i think in most of these cases it was not a deliberate thing , " @entity128 said			0
" local police lack training " on the @entity28 , she added , referring to the international agreement that mandates consular access			1
@entity10 's backers say he had learning disabilities and brain damage and had been sexually abused by his parish priest			2
they say those factors should have been considered at his sentencing			0
the @entity5 government had filed a supporting appeal with the high court in @entity196 , asking the justices to block @entity10 's execution			1
and on friday , the @entity39 administration asked @entity20 to delay the execution			0
" this case implicates @entity2 foreign policy interests of the highest order , " including protecting @entity2 citizens abroad and promoting good relations with other countries , solicitor general @entity201 said			2
@entity54 has also weighed in			0
sen. @entity208 , @entity209 , chairman of the @entity210 , introduced a bill in june to grant federal courts the power to review such appeals			0
" this case is not an isolated instance ; the issue of consular notification remains a serious diplomatic and legal concern , " @entity208 said thursday			0
in @entity20 , @entity40 's office countered that a federal appeals court had already given @entity10 the judicial scrutiny the @entity39 administration and the @entity224 were seeking			2
" if you commit the most heinous of crimes in @entity20 , you can expect to face the ultimate penalty under our laws , " @entity225 , spokeswoman for the governor , told @entity0			0
" @entity54 has had the opportunity to consider and pass legislation for the federal courts ' review of such cases since 2008 , and has not done so each time a bill was filed			0
" @entity238 , the state 's former solicitor general who argued the 2008 @entity12 case for @entity20 , said @entity10 waited too long to raise these issues			1
" the question is not should a foreign national have the right to contact their consulate , " @entity238 told @entity0			1
" the question is , years later , after they have been tried , after they have been convicted , after it has been clear like @entity10 that they are a vicious child rapist and murderer , should you come in and set aside that conviction			2
you ca n't come back years later and try and set aside your trial with some additional claim you wish you had raised			0
" @entity238 is running for the @entity254 as a @entity256 candidate .			0
