@entity0 -- on its face , the political showdown over extending long - term unemployment benefits to 1.3 million @entity4 is about offering a lifeline to those struggling to recover from a job market that has n't caught up to the recovering economy			1
but just below the surface is a political fight that will continue into the midterm elections in november			0
@entity13 say they 're trying to help @entity4 struggling to pay their bills until they get back on their feet and that failing to pass an extension will tank the economic recovery			1
@entity19 say they , too , want to help , but want to offset the $ 6.4 billion price tag with cuts elsewhere			0
they also argue such extensions are a disincentive to looking for work			0
caught in between are those who lost their benefits because of @entity28 ' failure to act late last year			1
why have unemployment benefits become a battle ? on tuesday , a @entity13 bill that would provide the three - month extension cleared its first hurdle in the @entity34 with the help of a handful of @entity19			1
in an effort to help end a budget stalemate and avoid another government shutdown like the one in october , leaders in both parties last month agreed to a deal that funded the government but excluded an extension of jobless benefits			1
as a result , @entity28 did not continue a 2008 recession - era law providing nearly a year of payments , footed by @entity4 taxpayers , that kicked in when state jobless benefits ran out			1
@entity13 promised to take up the issue as soon as they returned after their holiday recess , but republicans said they saw no reason to rush to preserve the benefits until it was time to make a deal			1
" i have to admit i am a little surprised at the fervor with which the majority is dedicated to reviving the expired emergency unemployment benefits after they ignored the issue all of last year , " senate minority leader @entity58 said during debate on the @entity34 floor on tuesday			1
@entity13 do seem to be playing it both ways â € ” taking credit for engineering the economic recovery , but claiming that the economy is still too fragile to withstand changes to assistance programs			0
the @entity71 also pointed out that @entity19 who voted for a similar jobless benefits extension since 2008 now oppose it			1
@entity19 have blamed president @entity73 for the slow pace of the economic recovery on the one hand while claiming that the economy is now stable enough to withstand the impact of letting people go without benefits			1
@entity13 feel like they are in a win - win position on jobless benefits â € ” if they win this fight , they are the champions of those struggling to recover from the @entity84 ; if they lose , they can blame the @entity19			1
the issue also can energize their base going into the midterms			1
extending benefits is a priority for congressional @entity13 and @entity73 , who is trying to make income equality a centerpiece of his second term			1
@entity19 want to keep the focus on the disastrous rollout of the president 's signature health care reform law and wield it in the midterm campaigns			2
the broader argument over the divide between the haves and have - nots will rage on through the midterms			2
however , conservatives are n't ceding the issue of income disparity to @entity13			0
rep. @entity107 of @entity108 and sen. @entity109 of @entity110 have both made addressing poverty part of their tentative explorations into possible 2016 presidential bids			2
the political war over poverty in remarks after the @entity34 vote , @entity73 noted that members of @entity28 have not yet passed the jobless benefits bill itself			1
" all they 've agreed to , so far , is that we 're actually going to be able to have a vote on it , " he told supporters in a speech at the @entity71			0
" we have got to get this across the finish line without obstruction or delay			0
" still , he achieved a major step on the path toward his goal when 60 senators -- including six @entity19 -- voted tuesday to move ahead with debate on the measure			2
" today brought us a glimmer of hope , " said sen. @entity137 , @entity139 - @entity138 , after the vote			0
" it shows that the big plates -- the tectonic plates in our politics -- are moving			2
" but @entity71 speaker @entity147 said he told @entity73 a month ago that another extension of temporary emergency unemployment benefits " should not only be paid for but include something to help put people back to work			1
to date , the president has offered no such plan			0
if he does , i 'll be happy to discuss it , but right now the @entity71 is going to remain focused on growing the economy and giving @entity4 's unemployed the independence that only comes from finding a good job			2
" the 60 yea votes were the minimum needed to allow debate to go forward and avoid a filibuster in the @entity34			2
@entity13 got help from @entity19 @entity165 of @entity166 ; @entity167 of @entity168 ; @entity169 of @entity170 ; @entity171 of @entity172 ; @entity173 of @entity174 ; and @entity175 of @entity176			0
@entity73 : extend unemployment insurance @entity73 was introduced before his remarks at the @entity71 by @entity179 , of @entity180 , @entity181 , who wrote to the president last month , explaining that she is unemployed and had been forced to cut back on food and home heating			2
" i have cut expenses everywhere possible , " she said , adding that she wears a coat inside her house to keep down heating bills			0
both her sons serve in the military , she said			0
" i hope our leaders in @entity0 can find a solution to help families like mine , " @entity179 pleaded			0
@entity73 appealed to @entity28 and the rest of the nation to do just that			1
" these are your neighbors , your friends , your family members , " @entity73 said			0
" when times get tough , we are not a people who say , ' you 're on your own			0
' we are people who believe we 're all in it together , and we know , there but for the grace of @entity213 go i. " @entity19 sen. @entity19 of @entity214 said he wants to help people , but insisted @entity28 must find a way to pay for the measure			1
" i , obviously , have people in my state who would benefit			0
the better way to go is to not add to the deficit in an irresponsible way , " @entity19 said			0
" i want us to get on the bill so we can talk about an offset to pay for it , " @entity225 said			0
" ultimately , i think we should restructure the unemployment compensation program so it 's more closely linked to job training for the long - term unemployed whose jobs probably are not coming back			1
" in the run up to the vote , conservative interests were applying heavy pressure			0
new year , same old fight over jobless benefits the @entity237 had urged all senators to vote " no " on the proposal and cited the lack of spending offsets			1
" @entity28 should end the federal unemployment insurance program and return the authority back to the states , which already have programs in place , " the group said			1
" absent this , @entity28 should pay for this extension by cutting spending elsewhere in the budget			1
after six years , an extension can no longer be called an ' emergency ' with any credibility			2
there is plenty of waste in the federal budget from which to find an offset , " it said			0
the @entity4 unemployment rate stood at 7 % in november , the most recent @entity261 statistics show			2
that means more than 10 million people were out of work , a third of them for at least 27 weeks			0
@entity1 's @entity267 and @entity268 contributed to this report .			0

the benefits extension is year 's first partisan showdown in @entity28
the debate over unemployment and poverty *foreshadows* midterms
