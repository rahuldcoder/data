since the start of the government shutdown october 1 , analysts , journalists and experts have been sorting through the claims of @entity6 and @entity7 about the underlying issues in the budget dispute			1
here 's a sampling of pieces published by @entity12 : @entity13 : world baffled by @entity16 's self - inflicted wound @entity16 's enemies must be laughing			1
but most of the world is just baffled , mystified at the sight of the world 's most powerful country tangled in a crippling web of its own making			1
the government shutdown is weakening the @entity16 before its allies and its foes			1
it is eroding @entity16 standing and prestige while reducing @entity16 power and influence			1
the democracy that once inspired the world now leaves observers perplexed			2
read more @entity37 : taxpayers , you deserve your money back if we had paid for an airline ticket , and in the middle of our trip the airline informed us that one leg of our journey had been canceled , we would justifiably demand a refund			2
if we ordered an annual subscription to 52 weeks of a magazine , and then , a few months into it , the magazine told us that its new policy was to publish only 26 issues a year , we would , with good reason , ask for half of our money back			2
if we paid for a one - year membership in a health club , and the club announced that it would have to close for repairs for three months , we would expect a 25 % refund			0
so ... exactly when can we expect to see our refund checks from the federal government ? read more @entity63 : shutdown could be shock therapy yes , conservative hard - liners have chosen the wrong place to fight ; arguments over @entity69 are no excuse to shut down the government			1
yes , hard - liners like sen. @entity73 , @entity74 , are creating deeper partisan divides			0
but @entity7 can ill afford to continue rejecting any talks or negotiations			0
now that the shutdown has happened , @entity78 has a fresh opportunity -- indeed a fresh responsibility -- to seize the mantle of leadership and get us out of this mess			2
instead of just blaming the @entity6 , he should call in the leaders of both parties and in @entity89 fashion , keep ' em talking till they get a deal			0
read more @entity92 and @entity93 : @entity95 's bad choices no @entity97 speaker wants to go down in history for a legislative record opposed by the majority of his or her own party			1
and no speaker wants to go down in history for presiding over one of the most unproductive congresses in history			0
but these are @entity95 's choices			2
while [ former speaker @entity111 ] @entity110 relied on a majority of the majority , @entity95 has had to rely on a minority of the majority , together with a majority of the minority , to pass important legislation			0
read more @entity119 : where 's the outrage ? the most stunning thing about this first shutdown of the @entity16 government in almost two decades is the degree to which it is a nonevent , considered par for the course given the sad state of affairs in the nation 's capital			1
but there are no mass demonstrations			0
@entity134 ' approval rating may have hit new lows , but beyond that , the response has been a shrug			0
read more @entity139 : @entity6 @entity97 ca n't claim to speak for @entity16 the @entity69 is law			1
the @entity97 @entity6 ' attempt to nullify a duly enacted law violates the norms of our constitutional system			0
it is reckless economically and an egregious affront to our democratic form of government			2
read more @entity150 : government shutdown is nothing to worry about so when president @entity78 says the shutdown will " throw a wrench into the gears of our economy " and put " the @entity16 people 's hard - earned progress at risk , " it is appropriate to treat such claims with skepticism			1
as we saw during the run - up to the march 1 sequestration trims in federal spending , politicians are incentivized by self - interest and unconstrained by shame in maximizing the hyperbole about what may happen if their ability to collect and redistribute our money is impeded even a little bit			0
read more @entity178 : @entity179 take the hit for @entity134 ' failure the closure of @entity16 's crown jewels threatens the livelihood of park businesses , gateway communities and the @entity16 families within them , whose economies rely on national parks being open for business			1
families , school groups and tourists from around the world who have made plans to visit and enjoy our national heritage will face disappointment			0
@entity199 , @entity200 , adjacent to @entity201 , attracts nearly 10,000 visitors daily in october			0
the loss of these visitors could be shattering to a community that relies on that final flush of tourism dollars before the steep drop - off in winter ... the federal government shutdown has made a bad situation even worse for our national parks			1
over the past three years , the @entity214 's budget has been cut by 13 % , or about $ 315 million			1
read more @entity215 : 10 % of @entity16 like @entity134 -- are they nuts ? when you think that 10 % of @entity16 believe @entity134 is doing a good job , you have to ask yourself one question : who are these people ? ... @entity134 is so dysfunctional that dictators in other countries are probably pointing at it as an example of why you should never have a democracy			1
yet , somehow , about 30 million @entity16 are looking at what @entity134 is doing and thinking : " i like what i see			1
" if you actually think @entity134 is doing a good job , something is terribly awry in your life			0
people in your family need to stage an immediate intervention			0
read more @entity234 : @entity237 shutdown a blow to science scientists at @entity237 and the @entity240 are some of the hardest - working people i know			2
the government shutdown means they are forbidden to do any work			1
they ca n't take their laptops home or phone into teleconferences from home , the way i might if a hurricane or snowstorm threatened @entity254			0
so , you might think they are having a nice ( though unpaid ) vacation			0
but actually , the same work is sitting on their desk when they get back , and it all has to get done			0
so it means they 'll work longer hours to catch up and for most civil servant scientists , there is no such thing as overtime pay			2

@entity12 commentators assess the impact and causes of the government shutdown
@entity13 : the *spectacle* is baffling to @entity16 's friends , *encouraging* to its enemies
@entity63 : the shutdown is bad , but could have a *silver* lining if it forestalls *default*
@entity150 : as in the past , we 'll survive the shutdown without lasting effects
