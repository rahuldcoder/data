@entity0 -- eight female badminton players were disqualified from the @entity3 this week for apparently trying to throw their matches to secure a favorable draw			1
it 's not the first time sports people have tried to improve their chances of winning , but is deliberately trying to lose a match smart tactics or disguised cheating ? two of the players involved were reigning world champions , @entity15 and @entity16 , who were considered gold medal contenders for @entity18			1
@entity18 's sports officials quickly accepted the punishment and players apologized publicly , although @entity16 subsequently suggested she was quitting the sport			1
soon after the badminton controversy broke it was the top - trending topic on @entity25 , @entity18 's most popular micro-blogging site , with over 15 million posts			1
read more : badminton players disqualified for trying to lose many cried foul , saying the athletes ' behavior was a disgraceful breach of the @entity34 code and was disrespectful of the spectators who paid money to watch the world 's best athletes do their best			1
one blogger said : " whatever purpose their behavior may be , it shows a loss of sports ethics			0
" but others defended the players and blamed badminton 's competition rules			1
win or lose , observers noted , all four pairs had already qualified for the next round			2
in the two separate matches , they played perfunctorily to lose so they could avoid facing their own teammates , or the top seeds , in the next round of competition			1
" the rules are irrational , " one blogger wrote			0
" you ca n't blame those who adopt a flexible strategy			0
" another blogger said : " i feel sympathy for the players because they have worked so hard and their dreams ended in @entity64			2
" read more : @entity3 special soon after her disqualification , @entity16 , only 26 years old , said she was quitting badminton			0
" this is my last match , " she wrote in a micro-blog to her 1.3 million followers			0
" farewell , my beloved badminton			0
" the next day , @entity16 said sorry			0
" i apologize to all our fans because we failed to abide by the @entity34 spirit , " she said			1
" i am ready to do my best in every game of my professional career in future			0
" it 's unclear if @entity16 is retiring , but the badminton flap has reopened one nagging debate in sports : is it fair to intentionally lose for tactical advantage ? " this is simple stratagem , " argued blogger qingchengweiliang			1
" any country would adopt it if they could			0
" to be sure , similar controversy has hit other sports			0
in a @entity94 match in 1982 , @entity92 quickly led @entity95 , 1 - 0 and the teams perfunctorily kicked the ball around the field for nearly 80 minutes			2
why ? because they knew that the outcome would allow both teams to advance in the next round of competition			0
the infamous match later prompted the @entity94 to revise its rules so that the final matches in group stage are played at the same time			2
it 's not the first time @entity18 sports teams have intentionally lost games to gain advantage			2
i remember a controversy in the late 1980s			0
playing at the @entity117 in 1986 , table tennis star @entity115 was instructed by her coaches to throw her semifinal match against a team mate , a defensive player , because they concluded that she stood a better chance than he to beat a @entity123 in the final			2
but @entity115 ignored the instructions and went on to beat her teammate and , a match later , the @entity123			0
partly because of her insubordination , he was dropped from @entity18 's three - woman @entity34 team in 1988			1
the incident triggered little controversy			0
@entity18 athletes typically abide by the idea of " organization discipline , " which expects them to subordinate personal gain and fame to the team'sâ € ” and the @entity143 € ” interest			2
a similar incident involved the @entity18 badminton team at the @entity146 in 2000 , says a report by the @entity149 sports			1
when a @entity152 player trounced her @entity18 opponent in the women 's singles semifinals , the @entity18 team officials asked coach @entity156 to convince top player @entity157 to drop her semifinal match to teammate @entity159 because they thought @entity159 had a better chance of beating the @entity161			1
in the end , @entity159 won the gold medal and @entity157 the bronze			0
years later , coach @entity156 recalled how badly he felt about the episode			0
" after we returned to @entity18 , i repeatedly praised @entity157 , " he said			2
" still it 's difficult to make up for it			0
" @entity156 said : " many times national interest and the @entity34 spirit are not contradictory , but sometimes they unavoidably clash			2
should national interest be above everything , or should it be the @entity34 spirit ? this should make everyone ponder			2
" the badminton controversy in @entity64 has triggered heated debate in @entity18 , with many people challenging the " gold - is - everything " mentality in @entity18 sports			1
some blame the lure of fame , cash and commercial endorsements that often come after the @entity34 athletes ' gold medal performances			1
" is this all athlete 's fault ? not really , " wrote a @entity193 correspondent , who blamed @entity18 's sports system of apportioning medals among players because , " apart from the coaches , sports officials and administrators ( who supervise the winning athletes ) will also be rewarded when athletes win gold medals			1
" on @entity18 's @entity25 , the hot topic in recent days has been " no gold medal , still a hero			1
" i see a hint of change			0
in the men 's table tennis singles final match on thursday , @entity212 , 28 , twice a silver medalist in two previous @entity3 , faced compatriot @entity214 , 24 , the reigning world champion			0
it 's a gold medal in the bag for the @entity18 team			1
if this played out several years ago , my guess is , the @entity18 team would probably have decided before the match that @entity212 should get the gold to top off his impressive but always - a - bridesmaid - never - the - bride career			1
instead , the two paddlers seemingly played for gold , entertaining the @entity64 spectators with their spinning serves and furious smashes			0
@entity214 won the match 4 - 1â € ” and the @entity34 gold			1
@entity214 is now hailed as @entity18 's new @entity34 star , but the @entity18 media is also heaping praise on the loser , @entity212 .			1
