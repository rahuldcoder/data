@entity0 -- two southern @entity3 imams accused of supporting the @entity5 @entity4 appeared briefly in a @entity0 federal court monday , before a judge pushed back the legal proceedings into next week so the suspects could sort out their legal representation			1
the two men -- @entity13 and his son @entity14 -- were arrested saturday in @entity3 , the @entity12 said			1
another of @entity13 's sons , @entity17 , was arrested that same day in @entity18 , @entity19			1
later monday , he likewise remained in federal custody after putting off entering a plea during his own initial court appearance at the @entity23 in @entity24			1
three others in @entity5 also have been indicted : @entity13 's daughter @entity26 , @entity13 's grandson @entity27 and @entity28			1
all six defendants face a four - count indictment that alleges they conspired to provide material support to a conspiracy to kill , injure and kidnap people abroad			1
it also alleges that they provided support to the @entity5 @entity4			0
about a dozen representatives of the two imams ' @entity3 mosques -- @entity39 in @entity0 for @entity13 , and @entity40 in @entity41 for his son @entity42 -- attended monday 's court session to support the men and hear the accusations against them			1
" he was their spiritual leader , so it is a shock , everyone is in shock , " said @entity46 , executive director of the south @entity3 chapter of the @entity48 , of @entity13 from the @entity0 court			1
the two were expected to be formally arraigned monday , with the possibility of bail being set			0
but at the defendants ' request , magistrate judge @entity58 said that would instead happen on may 23			0
@entity14 , 24 , had requested a public defender , but did not meet the court 's financial requirements to do so			1
he asked for more time to find his own lawyer , a request that @entity58 granted			2
his father , 76 - year - old @entity13 , was represented by @entity67 , a @entity68 , @entity3 - based lawyer who has " represented scores of individuals detained by the government since " the september 11 , 2001 , attacks , according to his firm 's website			1
@entity67 told the magistrate judge he was temporarily representing @entity13 , and requested more time to assess the case			1
afterward , @entity67 said his primary concern was the imam 's health , adding he hopes to get him home and out of the federal detention center at next week 's session			2
he described @entity13 -- who appeared frail saturday , with white facial hair and thick glasses -- as in poor health because of a heart condition , high cholesterol and borderline diabetes , among other problems			2
" my primary concern right now is getting him out , " said @entity67			0
the attorney added that his client plans to " challenge the evidence , " if and when it is presented in court			0
" at this stage , we do n't have anything other than what is written on a piece of paper by the @entity102 attorney 's office , " @entity67 said			2
in @entity24 , meanwhile , @entity17 appeared before magistrate judge @entity103 clad in a tan sweater vest over a dress shirt			1
he briefly answered a series of questions before delaying entering a plea on the charge that he is facing			2
@entity103 then continued the legal proceedings involving @entity17 to thursday			1
the indictment and all six arrests were not linked to the may 2 killing of @entity117 leader @entity116 in @entity5 , two @entity102 officials said saturday			0
the charges relate to alleged crimes committed between 2008 and 2010			0
authorities said their investigation focused on leadership at the mosques			0
the indictment describes a number of occasions when @entity13 transferred money to @entity5			1
" @entity13 solicited and distributed funds for the @entity5 @entity4 , both personally and on behalf of others , and worked with the co-defendants and others to support the @entity5 @entity4 's jihad , " the indictment says			1
the court documents also state there were several conversations between @entity13 and the other defendants in which @entity13 called for attacks against the @entity5 government and asked whether money had been delivered to the @entity5 @entity4			2
@entity13 also built a madrassa in @entity5 's @entity143 that provided shelter for the terrorist group , the indictment states			1
the term " madrassa " traditionally refers to any @entity150 school , but in recent years news stories about madrassas radicalizing @entity154 students cast the word in a negative light			2
" the main defendant @entity13 operated and controlled a madrassa to shelter members of the @entity5 @entity4 and to train children to become military fighters for the @entity163 , " @entity102 attorney @entity157 said			2
he said authorities are aware of several unindicted co-conspirators in the @entity102 and @entity5			0
the @entity5 @entity4 represent a confederation of @entity4 groups in northwestern @entity5 , where they are based , said @entity168 , military affairs analyst who is managing editor of @entity170			0
those fighters attack targets in @entity5 and neighboring @entity173			0
the @entity5 @entity4 , which is headquartered in @entity174 , is different from the @entity173 @entity4 , which has been focused on re-establishing the @entity175 in @entity173			0
both groups swear allegiance to @entity4 leader @entity178 and have close ties to @entity117 , @entity168 said			0
on monday , @entity46 from the @entity48 , said it was " too early to speculate " on what will be proven in the upcoming legal proceedings			0
regardless , he said it should not be seen as an indictment of @entity150 in the @entity102			2
" this is my community , we are peacefully in south @entity3 ( and ) we are all @entity102 , " @entity46 said from @entity0			0
" we love the @entity102			0
" @entity1 's @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 and @entity191 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity17 , one of 6 people charged , puts off entering a plea in @entity24
@entity13 and his son @entity14 say they both need time to sort out their legal representation
federal authorities claim the 6 gave money for a conspiracy to kill , injure and kidnap people
a @entity150 group 's official says of the indictment : " everyone is in shock "
