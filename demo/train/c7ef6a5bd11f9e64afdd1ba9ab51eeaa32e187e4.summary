former secretary of health and human services @entity0 called comments from @entity3 on the " stupidity of the @entity6 voter " regarding passage of the president 's signature health care law " totally offensive " and said she never worked with @entity3 " personally " though he worked " with a number of our agencies			1
" @entity0 made her comments monday after appearing on @entity14 , saying that the @entity16 economist was not an " architect " of @entity19 , as some have suggested , but agreed that he could be considered one by osmosis given his role in drafting the @entity23 health care law that she said served as a " template " for @entity19			1
but @entity3 's comments that the @entity28 administration misled voters could n't be further from the truth , she said			1
" you could n't have debated this more			0
it could n't have been more open , " @entity0 said , echoing comments president @entity28 made after videos of @entity3 surfaced online this month			1
aside from an appearance at the @entity36 this summer , @entity0 has largely steered clear of the public glare until she appeared on @entity14 monday morning to promote health care enrollment period for 2015			2
@entity0 resigns @entity0 also said that her successor secretary @entity39 is " very eager " for @entity0 to help publicize the second open enrollment period to sign up for health coverage that started this month			1
" she 's very eager for me to do whatever it is that i can to help spread the word , " @entity0 said of @entity39			2
" this is always an all - hands - on - deck moment to get the word out that open enrollment is underway			2
" @entity0 said she speaks with " folks " in the @entity50 on a regular basis and spoke with @entity39 as recently as this weekend			0
she also said , " other than politics , " she " has no idea " why the @entity50 @entity54 is suing @entity28 over changes to the law 's implementation , but said she tries to avoid speculating on legal issues			0
@entity0 added she is very aware that she has become the face of the health care law and the botched rollout of the health care enrollment website			1
" there 's no question that we had a very rocky rollout to the website and a miserable eight weeks that is seared in my brain as well as everybody else 's , " she said			0
@entity0 acknowledged that she and her team " clearly ... did n't focus enough " on the tech side of the rollout because she was more concerned about ensuring that enough @entity6 signed up and enough insurers jumped into the new health marketplace			1
but @entity0 also touted the successes of the law , pointing to close to 8 million users who successfully used the website and the 1 million signups by january 1 , 2014			0
about 6.7 million people have now signed up for health coverage under the law since the 2013 rollout			0
@entity0 added that @entity19 has been " branded badly " and while many voters still balk when they hear " @entity19 , " polls suggest that voters agree with the health care law 's components			1
she said the term @entity19 " has become very , very negative , " but said individuals approve of the law 's policies to allow young people to say on their parents ' plan until they turn 26 and approve of policies preventing insurers from denying coverage due to preexisting conditions			2
" i 'm not sure that we need to get people to love the act , they just need to understand what it 's about , " she said			0
" if they like the pieces of it , that 's fine			0
" @entity0 had ' toughest job in @entity112 '			0

@entity0 said her successor is " eager " for her to help with the open enrollment push
the former health and human service secretary called @entity3 's comments " totally offensive "
she said she did n't " focus enough " on the tech side of the @entity19 rollout
and while @entity127 has been " branded badly , " she said @entity6 like the policies that are part of the law
