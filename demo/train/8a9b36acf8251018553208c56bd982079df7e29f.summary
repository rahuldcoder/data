@entity0 -- @entity2 stared at the passport application in front of him , dumbfounded			0
his problem was not the questions asked , but the language they were written in			0
" i do n't speak @entity11 very well , " he said as he struggled to fill out the @entity10 government form			2
" i 'll have to call my mom			0
" the 18 - year - old is one of more than a million people that @entity16 officials estimate could benefit from the @entity19 administration 's deferred deportation program aimed at illegal immigrants younger than 30 who came to the @entity16 before the age of 16			1
details about how immigrants can apply for the program , which administration officials announced last month , have not been released			1
but already young people are flooding @entity10 consular offices around the @entity16 , trying to get the citizenship documents they 'll need from their home country in order to ask for a reprieve from @entity16 immigration officials			1
for immigrants , recent policy changes are personal this week , @entity2 waited in a long line at the @entity10 consulate in @entity0 before a clerk took his fingerprints , reviewed his documents and helped him fill out the passport form in a language he sometimes struggles to understand			1
the high school senior was born in @entity10 but brought illegally to the @entity16 when he was 8 years old			1

getting a passport from a country he barely remembers is the first step to get into college , @entity2 said			0

the process is not always simple for young immigrants in the @entity16 who do n't have birth certificates or passports handy , said @entity59 , consul for protection at the @entity10 consulate in @entity0			1
some of the hundreds of children who have lined up at the consulate over the past few weeks have no idea where their father is , @entity59 said			0
that 's a problem because @entity10 law requires kids under 18 to have the signature and fingerprints from both parents			2

we will do what we need to help these kids , " she said			0

all 50 consular offices in the @entity16 have organized information sessions on the issue , and consular officials are also carefully reviewing documents to avoid fraudulent applications , she said			1
the @entity19 administration 's shift last month on the politically volatile issue of immigration policy prompted immediate praise from @entity105 leaders who have criticized @entity106 and the @entity107 for inaction , while @entity109 reacted with outrage , saying the move amounts to amnesty and usurps congressional authority			0
under the new policy , people younger than 30 who came to the @entity16 before the age of 16 , who pose no criminal or security threat and were successful students or served in the military can get a two - year deferral from deportation , homeland security secretary @entity114 said last month			1
it also will allow those meeting the requirements to apply for work permits , @entity125 said , adding that participants must be in the @entity16 now and be able to prove they have been living in the country continuously for at least five years			2
in @entity10 , @entity133 immigrants under fire up to 1.2 million illegal immigrants could benefit from the program , according to @entity16 government estimates			1
more than 58 % of the estimated 11.2 million illegal immigrants in the @entity16 are @entity10 , the @entity138 said last year			1
@entity59 said she did not know how many @entity10 citizens would require consular services associated with the new @entity16 program			1
but those who qualify can come to the consulate without an appointment , receive assistance and have their request prioritized , she said			0
this week , @entity148 and her brother came to the @entity0 consulate to start processing their paperwork so they can apply for the @entity16 deferral program			1
" it will allow me to go to college , to get a job and feel safe here , " the 18 - year - old said as she waited in line to get her picture taken			0
