-- i heard on the news that @entity3 passed away			1
@entity3 , 43 , ended his life last wednesday			1
he did so as purposefully and violently as he played the game of football			1
today , a public memorial is planned for him at @entity8 in @entity9			1
junior , like my former teammate @entity11 and friend @entity11 , both of whom also committed suicide , played the game as they were taught , with reckless abandon			1
these guys did n't just tackle opponents ; they ran through them , never applying the brakes before collision			1
and they did what all great athletes do : they learned to play with pain			1
@entity26 analyst @entity25 , a former teammate of @entity3 with the @entity27 , said of @entity10 that " he never let you see his pain			1
" he also said that @entity10 would not get treatment with his teammates but would do so privately , so he was seen only at full strength			1
the recent spate of suicides committed by former players has the @entity37 and the entire sports world examining the cumulative impact of concussions over the span of a career and a lifetime			1
the emerging research on chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( @entity46 ) has helped identify at least one culprit in the uncharacteristically fatal behavior of men who lived by the creed , " never give up			1
" but inherent in that creed is a zero sum mentality that teaches us all to " play with pain			1
" this also means that we learned to live with pain			1
together with @entity46 , this is a lethal combination that can be very difficult to see , unless we change our lens			0
when i received the news about @entity10 , i had just walked out of my daughter 's second - grade classroom			1
a few dads were helping with a craft for @entity66			0
while in class , i complained to another dad about the painful decision of saving my back or my knees while assisting children with their cutting and gluing			0
i knew the source of my physical pain , and it is a constant reminder of a proud football career			1
i accept that i gave my body to the game i love and every day i experience the consequences			0
that has long been the lament of former athletes : bad knees , bad back and nagging body aches are the battle scars of weekend warriors			2
during the drive home from school , i thought of the scars that riddle my body and mind			2
and , for the first time in the discussion of the life expectancy of @entity37 players , i saw myself			0
junior is the 19th player that i played with or knew personally from college and professional football who is dead , all before 50			1
he is the fifth to commit suicide			2
then i thought of @entity103			0
in 1986 , when i was a quarterback at @entity105 , we installed a defensive formation called @entity103			0
it moved the free safety , a position usually 18 yards away from the line of scrimmage , to just half that distance			0
the purpose was to stop the quarterback ( me )			0
our free safety was @entity116 , now assistant strength coach for @entity118 champs the @entity119			0
for 20 days , we purposely and violently ran through each other several times a day			0
each collision brought admiration , respect and a hardening of our resolve			0
we knew we were making each other better			2
if we survived each other , no opponent could pose a greater challenge			0
we played for another 10 years , but we still laugh about the ringing in the ears and the workman - like way we went at each other that spring , conditioning ourselves to raise our threshold for pain			2
we were young men demonstrating the rules of masculinity and sports			0
ignore pain , leave it on the field and never back down			2
as a businessman , i know the merits of those qualities that transferred from my athletic career			0
but i wonder ( and fear ) as a man and as a person about what other physical and emotional qualities transferred ? at what costs ? and when will i find out ? women are twice as likely to attempt suicide but men are four times more successful			2
we both suffer from mental illness and seemingly insurmountable stress			0
but men are also less likely to show signs or ask for help			2
this leads to the " if you ca n't fix it , force it " approach that is evident in most violent acts committed by men			1
sadly , there were signs with @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity167 and all the other players who have committed suicide			1
and , they knew it			2
what they did n't know was how to tell us			2
and , we did n't know how to see it in them			0
we assumed that they were like most players who find it hard to adjust to life outside the locker room , without the game			0
it 's easy to see them as warriors without a war			0
it 's harder to see them as men without capacity to say , " i hurt and i need help			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity195 .			1

@entity195 : @entity197 's @entity3 , who committed suicide , to be memorialized today
he says research shows punishing head injury , living with pain leads some to suicide
he says he has his own scars from football ; @entity10 's death a *sobering* reminder of toll
@entity195 : @entity10 knew there were signs he was in trouble , did n't know how to get help
