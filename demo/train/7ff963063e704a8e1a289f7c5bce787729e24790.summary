" people do not understand the unbelievable opportunity that mobile photography is giving photographers , " @entity9 said			1
" it 's a golden age			1
" @entity9 offered these tips : 1			1
it 's all about the light			1
" photographing in the right light -- early morning or late evening -- has the potential to make the most ' boring ' situation into a spectacular one ! " 2			1
never use the mobile zoom			1
" it 's terrible and the first step to an unsuccessful image			2
if you want to get close , zoom with your feet ! get close and your images improve , " he said			2
lock your exposure and focus			2
your photos will improve 100 % , @entity9 said			1
" with the default camera app , you can tap and hold on the screen to set where you want your exposure and focus			2
once the box " blinks , " it 's locked			2
you can also use other apps like @entity48 to separately set and lock the exposure and focus			2
" see if you can go one day of shooting every time your inner voice says , ' i 'd like to take a picture			2
restrain yourself from sharing everything			2
post only the best , and your audience will grow			2
" we do n't need to see all 10,000 of your ugly children , " he said			1
" i try and pick my least ugly			0
it 's hard to choose and very personal			0
" exercise your power of observation			0
learn to look and see deeply			0
filters do n't replace a good eye			1
" you still need the basics			0
look for the moment and light and subject			0
if you choose to add a sepia , black and white or other nostalgic or creative filter later [ with an app such as @entity80 or @entity81 ] , that 's ok , but remember lipstick on a pig , it 's still a pig			0
" and if it 's for journalism , he added , " then it needs to be unfiltered			0
shoot from the hip for better candids			1
" hold the phone about waist - level and tap away			0
your friends and family will not know what you 're doing			0
the moment they know you 're shooting , the images become less candid			0
you 'll get a lot more bad shots , but when you get a good one , you 'll want to hang it on the wall ! " 9			1
give yourself assignments and deadlines			1
take 20 images of one thing from different angles			0
you 'll begin to see the world differently , even if it 's just walking around the bowl of fruit on your kitchen table and observing how the light falls on it from different angles			0
you have to know what you want to see before you can see it			0
" make a list of things you want to photograph today and find them ! if you know my work , then you know the no. 1 thing on my list are men in fedoras ! or any hat for that matter ! " 11			0
" i spend an unhealthy amount of time looking at images			0
it 's the only way to get better , in my humble opinion			0
my favorites are @entity137 , so happy we discovered @entity139 , and on @entity80 , a dude named @entity141 out of @entity142 is just killing it ! " 12			1
" you want to make sure that when your mind and heart says ' shoot , ' you have no excuses , like , oh , my camera was in my purse , pocket , or , gasp , your camera was n't around			1
it 's one of the main reasons i love mobile photography -- my camera is always with me			1
