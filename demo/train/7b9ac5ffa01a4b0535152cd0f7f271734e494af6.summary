@entity0 -- just a few minutes after 7 a.m. on saturday , @entity2 took a step many political experts did not think he would -- choosing a controversial and bold running mate and making one of the most important announcements of his campaign at a time many did not expect			1
rep. @entity10 admits that he is the poster child for controversial proposals to reform the nation 's entitlement programs : for workers now under the age of 55 , seniors would be given the option of choosing a private program instead of the traditional @entity20 program and would receive money to offset the premium they have to pay			1
federal spending for @entity24 would be sent to the states to manage , and the @entity27 retirement age would gradually be raised to 70			0
because of those positions and his full - throttled defense of them , @entity1 chief political analyst @entity31 calls the pick " a risky choice that could hurt @entity2 " and also said it " may be too risky , but is bold			1
" @entity36 consultant @entity35 said making a bold choice like @entity10 was necessary			1
@entity2 announces @entity10 as his running mate " with @entity2 losing ground to president @entity41 in the polls , i do n't see the selection of @entity10 as ' risky , ' i see the choice as bold and necessary , " @entity35 wrote in an email to @entity1			1
" @entity10 will certainly help @entity2 shore up his support with the @entity36 base , and it will send a clear message to independent voters that @entity2 is serious about getting the country 's fiscal house in order and putting @entity52 back to work			1
" @entity1 senior political analyst @entity54 says the @entity10 pick is , " an opportunity for the @entity2 campaign to go on the offense			1
" @entity10 is seen as a plainspoken @entity59 who does n't back down from positions			2
@entity62 attacks on @entity10 focus on changes to @entity20 and @entity24 " if you do n't address these issues now , they 're going to steamroll us as a country			2
and the issue is the more you delay fixing these problems , the much uglier the solutions are going to be , " @entity10 told @entity31 in an interview last year			1
" we literally go about $ 10 trillion deeper in the hole of our unfunded government promises every year we delay fixing the problem			0
" several leading conservative voices , including the @entity78 and the @entity79 , had pushed @entity2 this week to be bold			1
" the case for mr. @entity10 is that he best exemplifies the nature and stakes of this election			2
more than any other politician , the @entity85 has defined those stakes well as a generational choice about the role of government and whether @entity52 will once again become a growth economy or sink into interest - group dominated decline , " the @entity79 said in an editorial on thursday			0
the @entity79 argued that a @entity10 choice would help the @entity36			2
opinion : how @entity10 could help @entity2 " the larger strategic point is that mr. @entity2 's best chance for victory is to make this a big election over big issues			1
mr. @entity41 and the @entity62 want to make this a small election over small things -- @entity2 's taxes , his wealth , @entity106			2
as the last two months have shown , mr. @entity2 will lose that kind of election			0
to win , mr. @entity2 and the @entity36 have to rise above those smaller issues and cast the choice as one about the overall direction and future of the country			2
" @entity10 , a 42 - year - old fitness freak , also brings a youthful vigor to the campaign and is an energetic campaigner and debater			0
he jogged tieless onto the stage on saturday as @entity2 introduced him to a cheering crowd			0
but there will be those who question whether a @entity85 member whose primary focus has been fiscal issues is ready to be commander - in - chief			0
@entity41 's campaign quickly fired off a statement looking to define the contrasts in the campaign : the @entity36 ticket favors tax cuts for the wealthy while putting a greater burden on the middle class , it would gut @entity20 and shift costs to the elderly , and it would make deep cuts in education			0
as statement from @entity41 campaign manager @entity141 also invoked the b - word : " as a member of @entity145 , @entity10 rubber - stamped the reckless @entity147 economic policies that exploded our deficit and crashed our economy			0
now the @entity152 ticket would take us back by repeating the same , catastrophic mistakes , " @entity141 wrote			0
exclusive : how @entity2 chose his running mate besides the choice of who , political analysts also call the timing of the @entity10 announcement bold			1
while most vice presidential picks have been announced only days before the @entity36 convention , @entity2 is unveiling his ticket -- which the campaign is calling " @entity52 's @entity167 " -- more than two weeks before the @entity36 gathers in @entity165 , @entity166			0
some experts have said such an early choice would diminish any bump in the polls the campaign might see			0
the @entity2 campaign argues that the continuous news environment in the nation now means old rules may not apply			0
it is hoping that @entity10 's unveiling will get a lot of positive coverage as it couples the announcement with a bus tour of swing states through tuesday			0
@entity2 's aides hope the coverage will give the campaign a break from some of the bad press it has gotten over the last week following gaffes during his tour of @entity193 and @entity194 , relentless calls for @entity2 to release more of his tax returns and falling poll numbers			1
how do you feel about @entity2 selecting @entity10 as his running mate ? let us know on @entity199 .			1
