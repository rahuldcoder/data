-- variable wind , thunderstorms and the loss of 35 helium - filled balloons within a few hours of liftoff put an end to the flight of two lawn - chair - seated adventurers who never got out of @entity10			1
@entity12 and @entity13 , who had hoped to reach northwest @entity14 by sunday , landed late saturday afternoon southeast of @entity16 , @entity10 , team officials said			1
@entity17 : watch the balloon adventure lift off the men were disappointed but not injured , flight spokesman @entity19 told @entity0			1
" they 're a little rattled , " said @entity19			1
" we are glad that they are safe			2
@entity25 is very disappointed they did not get what he set out for			2
" @entity12 and @entity13 , seated side - by - side in a specially built rig , went aloft at @entity12 's service station in @entity31 , @entity10			1
but within a few hours , about 35 of the large 350 helium - filled balloons had burst , said @entity19			1
that compared to the loss of six balloons lost in a previous @entity12 flight to @entity37			1
@entity12 and @entity13 , an @entity39 , released water stored in four containers as ballast so they could adjust their altitude , said @entity44 , a member of the chase crew			2
at about 11,000 feet , the craft struggled to reach higher elevations , where it could catch air currents that would push it toward its destination , said @entity44			1
the pair circled for three hours near @entity16 , about 35 miles northeast of @entity31			1
" unless the wind starts taking them somewhere at this point they wo n't break distance records , " @entity44 told @entity0 before the decision to land			2
the weather then became a larger factor as thunderstorms moved in			0
" @entity13 said it was hailing and snowing on them , " said @entity44			0
" they got real concerned about that			0
they wanted to get down			0
" after attempting a first landing , the balloonists brought their craft down in a farmer 's field			0
@entity44 , who operates an appliance service in @entity31 , helped @entity12 construct the rig			1
" we would put it together , keep making changes and take it apart , " he said			0
" it was very exciting and fun to do			0
it 's just disappointing at this stage			0
" the flyers used balloons and the release of water to control their flight			1
" the only way you can steer it is to get up or down to get in different air currents , " according to @entity44			0
after the rough landing saturday , the rig took off again , sans adventurers			0
@entity19 described the surreal sight while talking with @entity0			0
" it 's sitting at about 4,000 ( feet ) and not going anywhere , " he said			0
according to the team 's website , @entity98 and @entity12 plan to launch a cluster balloon craft to raise awareness of the plight of @entity39 orphans later this year			2
@entity19 said he did not know the status of the @entity107 flight .			2
