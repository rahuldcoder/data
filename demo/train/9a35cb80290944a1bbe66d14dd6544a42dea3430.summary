@entity0 -- the @entity2 has ordered checks for cracks in the wings of the @entity6 , though it has stopped short of grounding the fleet			1
@entity1 examines some key questions about the aircraft and what it means for the passengers , the airlines and the manufacturers			2
what is the @entity6 ? the jet liner is a double - deck , wide - bodied aircraft made by @entity6 -- a subsidiary of the @entity19 -- and capable of carrying more than 800 passengers , though it routinely carries far fewer			1
it made its maiden flight in 2005 and first entered service with @entity24 in 2007			0
as of january 31 , 2012 , the company said it had delivered 68 aircraft to customers and had orders for a further 185			0
which airlines fly it ? the @entity6 is currently in service with @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity24			2
@entity6 says within the first three years of service , about 15 million passengers had flown in the jet			1
is there anything distinctive about the airliner ? its potential capacity makes it the largest passenger carrier in the world -- although the @entity47 is a longer aircraft			1
@entity49 , air transport editor of flight international magazine , says it was developed to compete with the @entity47 which had dominated the jumbo airliner market for decades			1
" apart from its size , the @entity6 is notable for its quietness , " he said			2
" it 's quiet both inside and out , and that 's quite an achievement , and spacious			0
it 's also an efficient aircraft -- it has a low fuel bill per passenger which keeps the airlines and the environmental lobby happy			2
" @entity47 says on its website that the 747 - 8 will be quieter , produce lower emissions and achieve better fuel economy than any competing jet liner			2
so what 's the problem with the @entity6 ? the @entity2 ( @entity2 ) last month required checks for cracks in the 20 oldest aircraft after faults were found in the wing rib feet -- the bracket that joins the ribs to the wing surface			1
it has now expanded the request that carriers carry out inspection and repair on the @entity6 before reaching 1300 flight cycles			1
for aircraft already very close to 1300 flights , a six - week window is being provided so they can plan ahead for their inspection to minimize disruption to their operations			0
a spokesman for the aviation agency said the planes could still fly , but had to be checked within the time frame , and a long - term fix was being worked on with @entity6			1
the original cracks were found as a result of investigations into a separate incident in which a @entity98 suffered an engine failure in november 2010			2
if cracks are found , the airline must contact @entity6 for instruction , the safety agency said			1
should passengers be worried ? @entity6 chief executive @entity105 told @entity1 's @entity106 last month that the cracks in the wing rib feet were " minor " and that safety was an " absolute priority			1
" @entity111 also said he did n't believe safety was an issue , adding : " it 's a structural issue and structural issues have to be investigated but the wing is n't going to fall off as a result of the problem			0
@entity2 could ground the aircraft if it wanted to -- but has n't			0
it 's not categorized as an emergency			0
" in response to last month 's checks , @entity105 said : " what we have developed already is a repair solution , and this is what we will apply on the various aircraft if and where it is necessary			1
" he also said the fault was confined to the @entity6 and confirmed that it was not a wider problem on the @entity6 range			2
what does it mean for @entity6 ? @entity105 admitted the fault was embarrassing for @entity6 but @entity111 described it as more of a " teething problem			0
" he told @entity1 wednesday : " i do n't think this will harm its reputation in the long term			0
the plane is very reliable and proving to be very popular			0
i think the airlines will stick with it			0
the @entity6 is here to stay			0
" what about the competition ? the rivalry between @entity6 and @entity148 competitor @entity47 is intense			1
both companies have accused each other of receiving illegal subsidies and in 2005 both filed complaints with the @entity154			0
the wide - bodied @entity47 was made in response to the @entity6 to battle for the custom of airlines running long - haul routes , and for freight trade -- and the manufacturers continue to upgrade their designs and improve efficiency			1
when the two models were compared by @entity165 in 2006 , the magazine concluded : " it will be another five years at least until it becomes clear who has got it right , but one thing is certain -- the airlines at last have what they always wanted and that is a choice of supplier at the top end of the size spectrum			0

the @entity177 air safety agency has ordered safety checks for all @entity179 after cracks were found in the wings
the @entity6 can potentially carry more than 800 passengers and is said by an industry expert to be a very quiet aircraft
its main rival is the @entity47 which is also *claimed* to be quiet and efficient
@entity6 says it has found a " repair solution "
