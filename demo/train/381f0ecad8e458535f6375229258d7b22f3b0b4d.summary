some state legislators in @entity1 want to teach a lesson -- to two of the state 's public universities			1
the legislators want to reduce funding for the @entity8 and the @entity9 because the schools assigned materials to students that dealt with homosexual themes			1
the state @entity14 is preparing to vote this week on a budget for the 2014 - 2015 fiscal year that would strip the @entity8 of $ 52,000 and the @entity9 in @entity18 of $ 17,162			1
the cuts are a fraction of the universities ' proposed state funding for next year -- @entity8 is set to receive $ 20 million and @entity9 $ 9.5 million			1
but the proposed cuts , despite being small portions of the schools ' overall budgets , have drawn outrage from students , faculty , and even some alumni from both institutions			1
many have taken their complaints to a website created to protest the cuts , and hundreds of individuals have posted , expressing their disapproval			2
" i am a gay @entity9 faculty member and a proud @entity40 alumnus ... and @entity1 is my home too			1
i wo n't stand by and let my academic freedom and my civil rights be devalued , " one post read			1
the situation stems from freshman assignments at both schools			1
last summer , the @entity8 provided incoming freshmen with a memoir , " @entity49 , " in which the author deals with coming out as a lesbian			0
the @entity9 , meanwhile , assigned " out loud : the @entity52 , " which features an account of @entity1 's first gay and lesbian radio show			1
rep. @entity56 , a @entity57 from @entity58 who proposed the cuts in the state @entity60 , says he heard of the assignments after receiving an e-mail of concern from a constituent whose 17 - year - old daughter was bound for the @entity8			1
@entity56 contacted the college 's board of trustees , inquiring if there were options for students " offended " by the subject matter			0
he says the school 's administration told him there were no options			0
" i think the university has to be reasonable and sensible to the feelings and beliefs of their students			0
that was totally ignored here			0
i was trying to hold the university accountable , " @entity56 told @entity83			0
" their stance is ' even if you do n't want to read it , we 'll shove it down your throat			2
' it 's not academic freedom -- it 's academic totalitarianism			0
" the @entity8 says that all of its more than 2,000 incoming freshmen do receive a copy of " @entity49 " as part of the school 's " @entity100 ! " program , but that the memoir is not required reading			0
if a faculty member assigned the book in class and a student was offended , the students could move to another section where the book was not assigned , according to the school			0
@entity9 assigned " @entity118 " to its more than 1,100 freshman as summer reading for @entity115 101 , but noted that students could take the class in their second year if they chose to do so			2
the president of the @entity8 , @entity120 , said in a statement to @entity83 that a university education must include a forum for students to engage controversial ideas , and that the looming budget cuts would undermine the school 's integrity			2
" any legislative attempt to tie institutional funding to what books are taught , or who teaches them , threatens the credibility and reputation of all @entity1 public universities , " @entity120 said			1
@entity56 , meanwhile , pointed out that the cuts from both universities are the exact costs of those two specific reading programs , and that the dollar amount for the programs , on which the cuts were based , was provided by the universities themselves			2
so far , there is no indication that momentum to pass the budget , and the cuts , is slowing down			2
the 2014 - 2015 state budget has already cleared the @entity153 subcommittee , as well as the @entity154 , where it passed 20 - 1			1
@entity60 member rep. @entity156 , a @entity57 and former professor at @entity157 , tried to reverse course by proposing an amendment to restore funds to both universities			0
it was voted down in the committee 13 - 10			2
" i feel that as a legislative body , it 's not our place to introduce social issues and punish or reward someone for what we like or what we do n't like , " @entity156 told @entity83			1
" i have serious problems with censorship			0
we do n't need to go down that slippery slope of taking retribution for content			2
" the ranking @entity178 on the committee , rep. @entity175 of @entity176 , also opposed the budget cuts but she said the amendment to restore funding was voted down because a number of the committee members did n't want to face backlash from conservative voters in @entity1			1
" that vote was not a vote of conviction , but a vote of self - preservation to protect themselves from a primary challenger , " she said			0
if the proposed cuts are approved by the @entity195 this week as part of the larger budget , the budget bill will then move to the @entity198			1
if it passes there , it will go to the desk of gov. @entity202 , a @entity57			0
the governor 's office did not respond to @entity83 's requests for comment			0
rep. @entity56 says many people have written and called him supporting the proposed cuts			1
" they appreciate me taking a stand , " he said			2
" i anticipate it will be a very active debate ( in the @entity195 ) , " @entity56 added			0
" we 'll see how it comes out			0
" a brief history of young adult literature books to read before you die			0

a legislative effort is underway in @entity1 to reduce state money for two colleges
freshman assignments at the schools included gay - themed material
the legislator who proposed the cuts says his supporters " appreciate me taking a stand "
an opposing *lawmaker* says *politicians* do n't want to face backlash from conservative voters
