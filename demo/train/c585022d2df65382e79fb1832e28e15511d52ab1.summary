@entity0 -- when @entity3 sold his house in @entity5 recently he faced a dilemma -- what do to with the proceeds			1
did he he take his cash to the bank or keep it at home ? he compromised			1
a third went to the bank , the rest stayed where he lives			0
in fact , the only reason he deposited anything at all was fear of a house fire			0

an outdated and debased system , open for decades to abuse by the previous regime , and shunned by about 90 % of the population			2
people here completely bypass the banks and keep their money at home			1
it 's the closest thing you 'll find to a total cash economy anywhere in the world			2
read more : change in @entity0 , the market view the @entity0 government has made fixing the banking system a priority but a quick visit to any branch reveals the size of the problem they face			1
it 's an extraordinary scene : teller counters and the office tables are literally overflowing with cash			1
bricks of the stuff , tied in bundles of a thousand notes balancing precariously on top of each other or littering the floor in large untidy piles			0
and customers bring in more in bulging shopping bags , while security guards wheel in white rice bags with still more bundles of kyat , as the local currency is known			0
@entity0 is still working on a real credit system and atm machines are a relatively new development -- if they work			1
like most businesses in the city and the towns , frequent blackouts means the systems shut down			0
i tried three atms over the course of a day			0

the banking system we take for granted in most countries -- easy loans , financial products , interbank operations , credit -- they 're all virtually non existent here			1
there is no proper corporate banking			0
businesses can not get loan repayment plans of longer than one year			0
true , they are rolled over but it means the central plank for corporate borrowing -- a realistic repayment schedule -- does n't exist			0
bank managers still have to telephone the central bank at the end of each trading day to tell them what the balance in the books is			0
there is now a banking law before parliament and until that is approved , thorough root - and - branch reform can not take place			0
and even when it does , the banks have to overcome enormous mistrust in the system , built up over two generations of mis - management			2
people here highly suspicious of banks			2
one clear sign of change is that credit cards are becoming more common , but only by @entity121 and @entity122			1
@entity121 plans to issue pre-paid credit cards by the end of this year			1
it 's a small step , but for @entity0 a small step in the right direction is critical as it gets ready to be part of a global integrated financial system .			1
