@entity0 , @entity1 -- the sun is rising over the @entity4 and @entity5			1
revolutionary music pumped through loudspeakers wafts over to @entity1			2
back across the river , work groups can be seen stirring for a day 's toil in the fields			0
over here in @entity1 , a tourist tout is trying to sell us @entity5 currency			1
" @entity17 price ! " he shouts			0
this is daily life in @entity0 , @entity1 -- a thriving border town within throwing distance of the @entity22			1
tourists often do just that when they go right up to the fence that separates the two countries and leave cigarettes , old watches and other goodies for the @entity5 border guards			1
signs all along the border warn against throwing goods over the fence , as if it 's some kind of zoo			2
and , in a way , that 's what it has become			0
@entity1 tourists now flock to @entity0 -- which lies along @entity1 's western border with the @entity5 -- to ogle at their unfortunate neighbors			1
some pay a few rmb to borrow binoculars to peer across the river , while the more adventurous take speedboats and pleasure cruises out on the river , which acts a natural barrier between the two neighbors			0
" go inside @entity5 ! " a sign for one local boat company proclaims			2
perhaps the @entity1 come to marvel at how far they have come			2
with decades of breakneck growth , communist @entity1 has become a testament to capitalism and urban living			0
@entity5 , which also describes itself as a socialist state , is still sealed and secretive -- almost			2
lifeline @entity0 is the lifeline , say critics , of the autocratic regime led by @entity65			0
whole neighborhoods in the back streets of the city are lined with trading shops quietly run by @entity5 officials			0
@entity1 is @entity5 's largest trading partner by a long way , and despite @entity74 's official displeasure with the @entity5 's pursuit of nuclear weapons , this trade continues to grow			1
@entity1 has rebuffed any attempts to strengthen economic sanctions further against @entity79			0
up to 70 % of all @entity1 trade with @entity5 runs through @entity0 , according to @entity83 's @entity82 news agency , and it takes the form of both legal trade and illegal smuggling			1
we meet " @entity88 , " a smuggler who makes a midnight run across the @entity4 several times a month to trade with @entity5 soldiers			1
" in @entity1 we do n't lack food , we do n't lack things , " he says			0
" people can eat and have clothes on their backs , but not over there , even the @entity5 soldiers have nothing			1
" despite @entity5 propaganda that paints a picture of their military as an elite fighting force , @entity88 says the soldiers are desperate for basic food such as bread and rice			2
they do n't have money so they barter with scrap metals , old pots and even ginseng			0
but @entity88 says he can never trade with ordinary @entity5 , the soldiers would n't allow it			1
@entity5 spies we ca n't use @entity88 's real name , he claims that @entity0 is crawling with @entity5 spies			1
" do n't say anything sensitive around the @entity5 waitresses , " he whispers to us			0
" they speak @entity5 and @entity121			0
" and you can find them all across @entity0 in @entity5 themed restaurants , karaoke bars , and musical review shows			1
we head to one of the more famous ones along the river			0
if refugees are caught trying to escape from @entity5 , they are shot , but in restaurants like this gaudy two - story tourist trap , @entity5 are allowed to work in @entity1 on special three - year permits			1
they are often the children of mid-level @entity137 loyalists and their movements and earnings are tightly controlled			0
and as the four - piece all - female @entity5 band plays to the @entity1 tourists drinking @entity5 beer , i think how perfectly it sums up this city : extremely bizarre and perhaps a little tragic .			2
