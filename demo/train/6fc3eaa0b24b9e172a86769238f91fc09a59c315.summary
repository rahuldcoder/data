@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 outperformed @entity4 at the @entity5 , but can @entity7 's biggest sporting star now do the almost unthinkable and surpass the @entity8 as the world 's richest female athlete ? maybe -- and that 's according to the man who represents both players			1
" she could , " @entity14 , the duo 's agent , told @entity2 after @entity3 won her second grand slam title			1
" it 'll be interesting to see how that shakes up			0
a lot depends on how she plays and how @entity4 plays			1
but they 're both in the same stratosphere , for sure			0
" @entity4 has been no. 1 in the earnings department as named by @entity25 every year since 2005 , the season after she opened her grand slam account as a 17 - year - old at @entity29			1
@entity3 's triumph in @entity1 last weekend , though , will increase her chances of landing more sponsors in her homeland , the world 's most populous country and its largest second economy			1
@entity2 estimated @entity7 's economy to be worth $ 10 trillion in 2014			1
@entity3 finished at no. 3 in the 2013 @entity25 list , one spot behind the dominant force in women 's tennis , @entity43			1
she was no. 2 the year before			0
" maybe we can do another one or two deals , " said @entity14			2
" but we ca n't add five more deals for her			0
" @entity3 was certainly a popular women 's champion at the season 's first major , being the crowd favorite throughout the fortnight			1
her on - court interviews have always evoked laughter and the soon - to - be 32 - year - old especially sparkled during the trophy presentation after downing @entity56 's @entity55			1
there she thanked @entity14 for making her " rich " and had more words for her husband @entity59			0
" you are so lucky to find me ! " she quipped			0
as of monday , the speech had been viewed on @entity62 nearly one million times			0
her light - hearted personality , along with the tennis success , makes for a desirable combination for sponsors , according to @entity68 , founder of @entity70 - based @entity69			0
" sponsors will find her progress in winning the @entity5 , together with her public persona of being fun and honest in her interviews , refreshing and engaging , " he told @entity2			1
" winning the @entity5 will make many more people globally aware of who she is as a player and this will attract brands			1
" but overtaking the longer established @entity4 -- upset by @entity55 in the fourth round in @entity1 -- might prove difficult			2
" the @entity4 brand has been in existence for many years and the essence of it was caught when she won @entity29 , " @entity68 said			1
" she has built her brand over many years , and provided @entity4 continues to be a top - 10 player her brand value remains enduring and more relevant as a global brand			1
" whereas , @entity3 's brand is a new regional phenomena , which carries significant value in the emerging markets of the @entity94 and will ripple into other regions of the globe			1
" along with a host of established backers , @entity4 launched her own candy line , " @entity100 , " two years ago and pulled in $ 29 million in endorsements and prize money last year , @entity25 said , as the @entity8 once again held top position			1
after @entity3 became the first @entity106 player to win a grand slam singles crown at the @entity109 , her value soared			2
companies including @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 helped @entity3 achieve $ 18.2 million in last year 's list , @entity25 said			1
@entity3 counts a following of roughly 22 million on @entity7 social media and her popularity is set to increase , according to @entity118 , a journalist with @entity7 website @entity119			1
" the people who have the most social media followers in @entity7 are movie stars , " he told @entity2			1
" they have something like 80 million			0
it 's a big difference			0
but @entity3 is right behind them			2
she 's the top of the sports industry			0
" she was quite popular already but after the win it 's getting more and more			0
people realize she 's not only a tennis player			0
she 's kind of a national hero			0
she also represents @entity7 women in a very good way so i believe her image is getting bigger not only in @entity7 but in front of the world			1
" and to think @entity3 almost did n't play at the @entity5			1
she considered retiring -- for a second time -- after an early exit at the @entity141 last may			0
criticism from the @entity7 media in the wake of that second - round defeat to @entity147 @entity146 left her reeling			2
" they gave me a very tough time when i played the @entity141 and it continued to @entity29 , " @entity3 told reporters			2
@entity3 decided to continue and , with famed coach @entity151 by her side -- he formerly guided seven - time grand slam winner @entity153 -- strung together a solid second half of 2013			2
she reached the quarterfinals or better at every tournament after @entity141 , highlighted by an appearance in the final of the year - end championships in @entity161			0
@entity3 was the first to admit she got somewhat lucky in @entity1 , only fending off a match point in the third round when @entity164 missed a makeable backhand down the line			2
the unexpected exits of @entity43 and two - time defending champion @entity168 meant @entity3 did n't have to face anyone in the top 20			1
but she was unfortunate in last year 's final against @entity168 , falling twice , injuring her ankle and head			0
the previous year she was beaten by @entity174 , taking the former world no. 1 to three sets in her maiden grand slam final			0
more than dollars and cents , @entity14 said this title was about @entity3 proving she was n't a one - slam wonder			2
" i do n't think this win is about the money , " he said			0
" i think it 's a big statement			0
a lot of girls have won a grand slam but winning that second one puts you in a different category			0
" she 's a wealthy girl and will get more deals and that will come , but this win is more about legacy			2
" one of the things we 're really looking to do is to solidify her desire to have a tennis academy in @entity7			2
so that 'll be a really big focus , having some sort of partnership with a property company there			0
