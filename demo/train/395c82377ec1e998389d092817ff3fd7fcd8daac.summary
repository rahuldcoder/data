-- reports have surfaced again in the past week that @entity2 is working on a phone			1
the latest news on the long - rumored project is that @entity2 has abandoned its plan to work on both the hardware and software , as @entity9 does , and instead will partner with hardware manufacturer @entity10			0
the @entity2 phone 's software , meanwhile , will be a modified version of @entity15 's @entity14			1
the question is : why ? why would a social network want to compete in the cell phone business ? and how can it , given that @entity9 , @entity15 and others already seem to have the market wrapped up ? does anyone want a @entity2 phone ? perhaps @entity2 users are clamoring for a new socially connected phone ? nope			1
judging by the reaction to the news around the @entity30 this past week , a good number of tech commentators and @entity2 users are n't the slightest bit keen on the idea of @entity2 releasing a cell phone			1
privacy concerns are among the top objections			0
@entity2 already has enough information about us , some people fear , and buying a @entity2 phone would surely provide the social - networking giant with even more control over our personal data			1
in fact , an informal poll found that 80 % of respondents did not want a @entity2 phone			1
only 7.8 % said they 'd consider it			0
if there 's very little demand for a @entity2 phone , then why pursue the idea ? to find the answer , it helps to consider the biggest growth sectors in consumer technology			1
while social networking is a large - scale trend , the growth of mobile phones is perhaps a larger one			0
other tech giants -- @entity9 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity15 -- have all made their claims here			0
in fact , @entity2 is a laggard in mobile networking : its @entity70 app launched a full 18 months after the groundbreaking tablet debuted			1
that 's a lifetime in the fast - paced world of tech. app stores this mobile megatrend breaks down into a series of smaller trends			0
take app stores , for instance			0
the app store is now the dominant way to distribute software to devices : the companies that manage these stores control the future of computing			0
@entity2 's @entity90 rivals , @entity9 and @entity15 , own the largest app stores , while @entity64 is likely to see success building its own app store on top of @entity15 's @entity14			0
@entity2 once looked to be the winner in app distribution -- the @entity97 showed huge promise -- but now it must go through its competitors to get its software on these devices			0
by building its own alternative to mobile app stores , either on top of @entity14 or using html5 apps on the @entity30 , @entity2 might get back in the game			2
mobile payments what about mobile payments ? it 's often been said that if @entity2 were a country , it would be one of the most populous in the world			2
@entity2 would love for that " country " to have an economy to match , and that means having all its users embrace @entity119			0
meanwhile , using your phone instead of your credit card is set to be a huge trend in 2012 thanks to the addition of " tap to pay " technology in some handsets			1
it 's the biggest change in payments technology since the credit card , and @entity119 does n't stand a chance			1
instead , rival @entity15 is plowing ahead with @entity133 , which when combined with @entity15 's @entity14 operating system could make @entity15 a leader in this hot market			0
social networking what about social networking itself ? could the growth of mobile web browsing undermine @entity2 's leadership here ? @entity2 's closest competitors for the social crown are @entity146 and @entity147			1
so what would happen if @entity15 were to put @entity147 right into @entity14 , the world 's most popular mobile operating system ? for @entity2 , that could be disastrous			2
@entity147 would come baked in to your phone , but getting @entity2 would require an additional download			2
a win - win ? so why is @entity2 making a phone if nobody wants to buy one ? perhaps because it has to : if @entity2 ca n't compete with @entity15 and @entity9 in mobile technology , it may find itself on the losing side of some of consumer tech 's greatest battles			1
i , for one , support the effort : if @entity2 succeeds , we all benefit from more competition in the smartphone market			1
and if @entity2 fails , we lose nothing			2
i 'd even be willing to bet on the likely outcome			0
@entity2 wo n't dominate the phone market , but it will figure out new ways to make our phones and our applications more social			2
that sounds like a positive outcome for all .			0

informal poll : 80 % of respondents do n't want a @entity2 phone
*facebook* credits do n't stand a chance against " tap to pay " tech in some handsets
despite its size , @entity2 lags in mobile networking
@entity191 : if @entity2 succeeds , we all benefit ; if it fails , we lose nothing
