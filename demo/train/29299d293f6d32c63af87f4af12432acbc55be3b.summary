-- a controversial bill that @entity3 legislators say would allow the early release of more than 27,000 inmates from crowded prisons will be taken up by the @entity7 on monday			1
inmates at @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity3 , interact in a gym modified to house them in august 2007			1
the @entity13 on thursday passed the corrections package 21 - 19 , after @entity13 president @entity17 @entity16 , @entity18 , assured senators the changes would protect the public from the most violent offenders			1
the legislation also would direct more resources toward parolees , he said			0
@entity13 @entity25 say the bill would undermine public safety			1
all 15 @entity28 voted against the measure			0
both houses of the legislature are controlled by @entity32			2
consideration of the bill comes as @entity3 faces a mid-september deadline for reducing its prison population by about 40,000 inmates			1
a special panel of three federal judges issued the order , contending the crowded prison system violates prisoners ' constitutional rights			0
the judges said they will make the reductions themselves if the state fails to act			0
the measure would save the financially strapped state $ 524.5 million , according to a statement from @entity16 's office			1
when coupled with budget revisions that lawmakers made in july , the total corrections savings would be $ 1.2 billion , he said			0
that is the amount that @entity56 gov. @entity56 wants as part of his efforts to cut state spending and balance the budget			0
republicans said the bill would lead to the release of about 27,000 prisoners , while @entity32 estimated it would reduce the prison population by 27,300 in the 2009 - 10 fiscal year and 37,000 during fiscal year 2010 - 11			1
" it is undeniable that the real failure of our criminal justice system is that it fails to distinguish between violent offenders and nonviolent offenders , " @entity16 said			1
" of course , we want to keep violent criminals off our streets and out of our communities , and this reform package is a necessary step to do that because it concentrates our incarceration efforts on the violent criminals and ensures that nonviolent offenders have more contact with parole officers , " he said			2
some nonviolent offenders could serve shorter sentences			0
according to @entity16 , each parole officer in @entity3 is responsible for about 70 parolees , many of whom recommit crimes and go back to jail			2
if the legislation is passed , the ratio would be reduced to 45 to 1 , he said			0
" they [ parole officers ] can not adequately supervise those who are the most at risk and those who are the most risk to the public safety , " @entity16 said			1
with a lesser workload , the officers also can make more home visits and arrange more meetings with the people they supervise , the lawmaker said			0
@entity13 @entity25 called the legislation a threat to public safety			1
" among the inmates who could be eligible for early release under the @entity115 plan include felons convicted of human trafficking , stalking , identity theft , violent child abuse and threatening to use a weapon of mass destruction , " the @entity110 said in a written statement			1
" unfortunately , this proposal exploits a fiscal crisis in order to advance a dangerous liberal agenda that seeks to undo successful anti-crime laws , " said @entity124 @entity123 of @entity125			0
@entity25 lawmakers in the @entity13 also strongly opposed the creation of what they described as " an unelected and unaccountable sentencing commission that would be given broad authority to alter important public safety laws			1
" the legislation would establish a 16 - member @entity138 that would put in place new sentencing guidelines by july 1 , 2012			0
unless vetoed by the legislature and governor , the guidelines would become effective january 1 , 2013			0
the 13 voting members of the commission would include the chief justice of the @entity3 @entity148 , a judge appointed by the chief justice , the state public defender and the secretary of the @entity153			2
a crime victim would be among the three ex-officio members			0
@entity157 speaker @entity156 , @entity159 - @entity158 , issued a statement early friday morning , explaining that the assembly recessed around midnight and will reconvene monday			2
on thursday and into friday morning , she said in the statement , " we have been taking into account many of the concerns raised by law enforcement , and are working toward a bill that the people of @entity3 can agree makes sense , " and that process will continue through the weekend			2
" our target remains a responsible approach that will achieve our public safety and budgetary goals , and allow us to prevent the wholesale release of prisoners by federal judges			1
" " relieving prison overcrowding and reducing recidivism are monumental challenges , but they are challenges that we will not retreat from , " @entity56 told an audience of prosecutors in june			0
@entity3 has a 70 percent recidivism rate .			2
