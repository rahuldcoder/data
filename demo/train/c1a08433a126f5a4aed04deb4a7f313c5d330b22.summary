-- my father spent his youth as a crossing guard , a @entity5 , and a designated driver			1
i , on the other hand , squandered mine cutting gym class and hanging out at the mall			1
back then , my father would deliver themed , @entity10 -- style lectures ( one recurring favorite was the @entity13 ) , which i grudgingly tolerated and later dismissed			1
but as i 've gotten older , a funny thing has come to pass : i 've often found myself doing exactly what he told me to do , following even his most questionable advice -- like renting the movie " @entity19			1
" herewith , his greatest hits			2
( caution : some of these lessons may trigger flashbacks to your own father 's finest moments			1
) @entity0 : making positive changes in your life 1			2
hold hands while you hash it out			1
my folks have been married for 47 years			2
one of my father 's rules for a happy marriage is that if a nasty argument erupts , hold hands as you fight			1
you 'll feel goofy doing this , but here 's the thing : it works			1
recently my husband , @entity42 , forgot to pay a few bills that were buried under a pile of clutter			1
i was incandescent with rage			2
so we interlaced our fingers while we talked it out , and i felt my blood pressure plummet and my endorphins flow in spite of myself			2
it 's impossible to scream at someone who is giving your hand a gentle squeeze			1
@entity0 : secrets of staying ( happily ) married 2			2
pay attention to anyone who wears a tool belt ... my father is practical , thrifty ( or , put more accurately , cheap ) , and savvy about home improvements			1
he calls a repairman only as a last resort -- and when he does , he hovers around the guy and asks tons of questions			1
" carefully observe anyone with a skill that you do n't have , " my father often said , " and then you can take care of the fill - in - the - blank yourself			1
" he was right : after shadowing a handyman for an hour , i later fixed my own dishwasher , to the perpetual amazement of friends who call their super to change a lightbulb			2
@entity0 : small , helpful gestures with big impact 3			2
it has always annoyed my dad that a waiter gets a 20 percent tip for serving a crème brûlée , while a hotel maid who disposes of used dental floss often winds up with bubkes			1
my father routinely told our sanitation men and the crew who cleaned his office that they were doing a good job and made sure to compensate them at holidays			2
as a child , i used to writhe with embarrassment when he did this			2
now i do the same for the sanitation workers in my neighborhood			2
one guy once told me , with a catch in his voice , that in 10 years , it was the first time he had ever been thanked			2
you can never have enough baggies			2
anything can be stored in a resealable plastic bag , according to my father			2
shoelaces , maps , socks , meat			0
i used to mock his habit of bagging everything , but since then i 've seen the light			0
they 're miracle workers -- easy to stash , and you can spot their contents at a glance			1
@entity0 : live your life on less now , just like @entity125 , i have a special drawer just for these bags , which range from giant ( for sweaters ) to tiny ( to squirrel away nuts in my purse )			0
when i 'm missing a size in my lineup , i get tense			0
you ca n't go wrong with @entity135			1
@entity125 says if you are at @entity137 and are unable to decide what to rent , get a @entity135 movie			1
even the bad ones , he contends , are superior to most other films			0
" even " @entity144 " ( look it up )			0
now , when i 'm overwhelmed by racks of dvds , i simply look for @entity135 's scowling face			1
@entity0 : keep mind and body in top condition 6			0
do n't belittle the annual sack race			1
when my sisters and i hit adolescence , my father doggedly upheld our many family traditions , despite a tsunami of scorn			0
" they do n't mean anything to you kids now , " he 'd tell us , " but one day you 'll invest in them yourselves			1
every @entity164 , we have a sack race , and i just introduced a new tradition last @entity167			0
after dinner , i passed out lottery tickets and coins			0
soon , all you could hear was an industrious scritch - scratch			0
and my father was beaming			0
for @entity173 's sake , stop worrying			1
@entity125 , like many guys of his generation , is a doer , not a talker			0
just " fix it , " he tells himself , no matter how intractable the problem seems			0
his swift and decisive action used to strike me , a champion ditherer , as impulsive , but i 've come to realize that consulting your gut leads to better decisions than exhaustive ( and exhausting ) deliberation			0
now when i 'm stymied , i say this phrase , and the answer comes			0
years ago , my parents and i were visiting a museum			0
my father handed me a fresh hankie and told me to keep it in my purse			0
tissues disintegrate , but not this sturdy cloth			0
restroom dryer on the fritz ? handkerchief ! want to wrap a cookie to go ? handkerchief ! 9			0
no one 's smarter than you			1
long ago , if i was in a group and the conversation strayed to an unfamiliar topic , i 'd keep silent			0
@entity125 urged me to say , " i do n't understand			1
can you explain what you 're talking about ? " asking questions makes you sound smart , he said , and confident to boot			0
@entity0 : 10 biz strategies to organize family life at a recent gathering , somebody mentioned the @entity217			0
then i asked , " what 's that ? " and all the former @entity220 around me exhaled and admitted they did n't know what the hell it was , either			1
my father always encouraged me to have a baby			0
i used to tell him that it was n't for everyone , but he shot back , " i know you , and you would love it			1
" true enough : @entity42 and i became parents recently , and that little girl is the joy of my life			0
i can not wait to impart my own pearls of wisdom to her , such as the infinite uses for twist ties or the @entity13 ( sound familiar ? )			0
and since she 's a lot like me , she 'll probably roll her eyes and grumble -- and listen to every word			1
