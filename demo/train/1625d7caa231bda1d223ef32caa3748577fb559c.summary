-- twenty - five of 27 spent - fuel storage casks at a @entity4 nuclear plant were shifted between 1 and 4 inches during last week 's 5.8 - magnitude earthquake , officials said thursday			1
the cylinders , each 16 feet tall and weighing 115 tons , were not damaged , and no radiation was released , said @entity8 , spokesman for @entity9 , which operates the @entity10 near @entity11 , @entity4			1
monitors were hooked up to the casks to determine any abnormalities , he said			2
he said the casks ' movement was known shortly after the quake , which had an epicenter less than 20 miles from the plant , but the news was not released to the public			1
" we had a lot going on , " @entity8 said			0
" there was no indication of any problem ... and there is n't any problem			0
" besides those casks , which are vertical , some of the horizontal bunkers holding spent fuel also were affected			2
the concrete " came loose on the face " of " a few " of the bunkers , @entity8 said , but the damage is not considered serious			0
the bunkers -- of which 13 of the 26 hold rods -- are each 16 feet long and weigh 50 tons			2
it is the first time such casks have been shifted by an earthquake in @entity43 history , said @entity44 , spokesman for the @entity45 , as it 's the first time a quake of this magnitude was felt at a nuclear plant in the country			1
the safety standards for such casks , he said , are " unbelievable			1
" they undergo a rigorous series of tests , including crash tests and burning			0
" to say they are robust would be an understatement , " @entity57 said			0
@entity8 , however , confirmed a report in the @entity61 that @entity9 had notified the @entity45 last friday that the earthquake might have shaken the power station more than it was designed to handle			1
the @entity45 already has an " augmented inspection team " at the @entity10 plant to conduct a review of effects from the earthquake			1
the team will review the casks ' shifting as part of that investigation , @entity57 said			2
the @entity45 initially sent a seismic expert and a structural expert to assist resident inspectors at the site after the earthquake , but " further reviews indicated that additional inspection is warranted , " the commission said in a statement issued monday			1
an augmented inspection team is formed " to review more significant events or issues " at @entity45 facilities , and includes technical experts and additional inspectors			2
an alert was declared at the @entity10 station just after the quake struck			0
the plant 's two units shut down automatically after the facility lost off - site power , according to the @entity45			1
emergency diesel generators provided power to cool the reactors until off - site power was restored a few hours later			0
" an alert is the next - to - lowest @entity45 emergency classification for plant events , and the @entity10 station exited the alert after off - site power was restored , " the commission said in a statement			1
both reactors remain in what is called a " cold shutdown , " @entity8 said			0
there is no timetable for their reactivation , he said			0
@entity0 's @entity114 contributed to this report .			0

new : the nuclear plant might have been shaken *harder* than it was designed to bear
the casks , each weighing 115 tons , moved between 1 and 4 inches in the quake
no radiation was released and the casks were not damaged , an official says
the safety standards for such casks are " unbelievable , " an @entity45 spokesman says
