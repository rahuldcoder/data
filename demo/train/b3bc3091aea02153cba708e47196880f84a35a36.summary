-- now that there is a respite in the debate in @entity5 over @entity6 , the budget wars are resuming			1
regardless of how tired the public has become of watching the parties wrangle over spending levels , congressional republicans have made it clear that they intend to keep the pressure on the president			2
the first round of the fight will come with the decision over whether to extend the continuing resolution to fund the government beyond its expiration date of september 30			0
@entity23 @entity7 leaders have already been forced to delay the vote because @entity25 @entity7 have threatened to vote no. they are demanding that the bill shut down funding for the new health care law , a key part of which goes in effect on october 1			2
the second round of the fight will take place in october , when @entity5 will need to raise the debt ceiling so that the federal government can meet its obligations			2
@entity7 leaders have said that in exchange for their votes on both measures , the administration will have to agree to steep cuts in domestic spending			1
as they have been doing since 2010 , @entity7 want to use these budget battles to depict themselves as the party of " fiscal responsibility " and to sway public opinion wars toward a national agenda that centers on reducing the size of domestic programs			1
based on what we 've seen thus far , the strategy will not work over the long term			0
while the @entity7 has been successful at preventing president @entity53 from dealing with other issues -- and now these debates can help put such issues as immigration reform at risk by pushing them off the legislative schedule -- their overall strategy can diminish public support for deficit reduction			1
nor is it likely to make @entity7 look like the responsible party of fiscal conservatism			2
why wo n't it work ? @entity7 have chosen to fight over spending cuts through dramatic high stakes maneuvers , such as shutting down the federal government or refusing to raise the debt ceiling that raise more questions about their party than about the issue at hand			1
@entity76 : the lowdown on the shutdown the @entity7 have watched as public opinion has turned against them			1
according to a recent @entity0 poll , 51 % of those surveyed would blame the @entity7 for a government shutdown			1
by dealing with budgetary issues through these risky tactics , which some say threaten the economy , the party hurts its ability to persuade the public that the @entity7 are interested in seriously pursuing fiscal restraint , as opposed to using this issue for purely partisan purposes			1
not only does this strategy raise questions about the @entity7 as a party , but it makes the issue of spending cuts appear more like a weapon than a topic of discussion			1
the @entity7 have also harmed their cause through their long - standing inconsistency about achieving fiscal responsibility			0
conservatives have been pointing to this problem for over a decade , as many had lambasted president @entity106 as a " @entity107 " who supported expansions of government such as the @entity112 prescription drug program			0
in the past two years , @entity7 proposals have concentrated most heavily on spending cuts for programs serving the disadvantaged while simultaneously promoting tax cuts that would only worsen the fiscal imbalance that the nation faces			1
by doing so , @entity7 arguments about fiscal conservatism have seemed more like an attack on the poor than a desire to balance the budget			1
@entity53 has tried to capitalize on this perception			0
on @entity126 , he said , " there 's no serious economist out there that would suggest that , if you took the @entity7 agenda of slashing education further , slashing @entity112 further , slashing research and development further , slashing investments in infrastructure further , that would reverse some of these trends of inequality			0
" nor have @entity7 done much to respond to the growing data that deficit reduction does little to help the economy			0
new research has cast great doubt on an economics paper that has been cited around the globe by champions of austerity in public spending			0
spending cuts in @entity152 nations have not produced the economic results promised -- in fact the opposite -- and that has also shaken supporters of the @entity7 here at home			2
yet , republicans have not offered much of a response , other than to stick to their pre-existing script			0
republicans will need to do more to counteract this growing evidence about the flaws of their arguments			0
there was a time when @entity7 could legitimately claim to be the party of fiscal conservatism			0
president @entity172 made balancing the budget one of his signature issues , devoting much of his second term fighting against all kinds of spending , including on the military , against the @entity5			2
while he was unsuccessful , @entity179 and @entity7 , as well as large number of voters , respected his belief in the program and the fact that he was willing to take political risks to fight for this policy			0
if @entity7 want to regain some of what @entity172 achieved for the party , and to win over skeptics who are doubting whether deficit reduction really should be the kind of priority issue that @entity7 say it should be , they will have to change course			2
starting in the coming weeks , they might want to begin by avoiding a government shutdown and raising the debt ceiling so that they can argue their case in a way that has a chance of persuading more @entity199 to back their ideas and their party			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity204 .			0

@entity204 : @entity7 are on a *suicidal* course on budget issues
he says forcing a government shutdown or a debt limit crisis would harm an already weakened @entity7 image
@entity204 : if @entity7 want to win public support , they need to debate spending without *manufacturing* crises
