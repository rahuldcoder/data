@entity0 -- the following is a primer on campaign finance terms relevant to the @entity6 's 2010 " @entity11 " ruling that loosened spending restrictions in federal elections , which will have an impact this election year			1
@entity12 ( @entity12 ) : -- an independent regulatory agency created by @entity14 with the mandate to " administer and enforce the statute that governs the financing of federal elections , " according to its website			2
individual donations : -- federal law limits this kind of direct contribution to a federal candidate to $ 2,500 per election			1
direct contributions to a national political party are capped at $ 30,800 per election			2
elections such as primaries , general elections and special elections are counted separately			2
corporate donations : -- direct contributions from corporations to political parties and candidates for president and @entity14 are banned under long - standing federal law			0
the " corporate " label can mean private businesses , labor unions and nonprofit special interest or advocacy groups			0
businesses had been prohibited from making such contributions since 1907 , labor unions since 1943			0
corporations can , however , make donations through political action committees			0
" hard " money vs. " soft money " : -- " hard money " refers to tightly regulated contributions to candidates , while " soft money " refers to unregulated , unlimited contributions to political parties for so - called " party - building " activities			1
traditionally , soft money donations have been used for get - out - the vote drives , voter registration efforts and ads that say " vote for @entity66 " or " vote for @entity67			1
" potential uses of soft money , however , were limited by @entity14 with the passage of the 2002 campaign finance law known as @entity72			1
@entity73 ( pacs ) : -- pacs are separate private entities set up by business , labor , individuals or other special - interest groups to raise and spend money to directly help elect federal and state candidates			1
pacs may give up to $ 5,000 per candidate and $ 15,000 for a political party each year			1
pacs may solicit money from individual employees , shareholders , or members , who themselves may contribute $ 5,000 per year to the pac			1
the @entity86 spent the most money in 2008 , more than $ 4 million			2
the @entity6 's @entity11 made independent spending lawful , but corporations or unions that want to contribute to federal candidate campaigns must still rely on traditional pacs for that purpose			1
pacs are subject to donor disclosure rules			2
@entity96 : -- a direct result of the high court 's 2010 ruling , which placed individuals and corporations on equal " free speech " footing when it comes to independent campaign spending			1
-- technically known as " independent expenditure - only committees , " super pacs may raise unlimited sums of money from corporations , unions , associations and individuals , then spend unlimited sums to overtly advocate for or against political candidates			1
@entity96 must also report their donors to the @entity12 monthly or quarterly -- the super @entity73 's choice -- as a traditional @entity73 would			1
that choice may prevent some donor disclosure until after the elections take place			0
-- unlike traditional pacs , super pacs are prohibited from donating money directly to political candidates			2
" 527 " groups : -- 527s are certain tax - exempt groups operating in part as political organizations			0
named after a section of the @entity135 tax code , they are largely funded by rich individuals , labor unions and advocacy groups			0
they gained attention in the 2004 campaign through the campaign activities of organizations such as @entity144			0
" 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) " groups : -- 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) groups are another type of tax - exempt group , named for a section of the tax code			0
they have grown popular in recent years , after the @entity12 raised questions about how some 527 groups were operating			0
the earnings of these 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) groups must be limited to " charitable , educational , or recreational purposes			0
" they have an unlimited ability to lobby for legislation and participate in political campaigns and elections			2
there are no political donation limits to 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) s , but such donations are generally not tax - deductible			0
these organizations do not have to disclose their donors			1
issue ads : -- these ads are the most prevalent form of spending by outside groups , like @entity172 and the @entity173 ( @entity173 )			1
they can indirectly express support for or opposition to a candidate but may not explicitly urge the viewer to vote for or against that candidate			2
critics of such advertising call them thinly disguised campaign commercials			0
sponsors do not have to disclose their donors or source of funding , and political parties themselves are free to use their money on these issue ads. public funding : -- presidential candidates who have collected enough donations can qualify for federal money to match what they have raised privately			1
public matching funds apply only during the early primary contests , whereas major party presidential nominees qualify for a lump - sum grant that can be used for the general election in november			0
in return for accepting public funds , candidates must agree not to go over specified spending limits			0
president @entity206 opted out of federal matching funds during his 2008 primary race , because he was able to raise so much money from private donors			1
he also turned down public funds in the general election			0
@entity1 's @entity213 , @entity214 , and @entity215 contributed to this report			0

the rules *changed* after the *landmark* " @entity11 " ruling by the @entity6 in 2010
@entity96 can spend unlimited money but must disclose donors
they use these *dollars* to *flood* *airways* with issue ads and ads supporting a particular candidate
