-- it 'd be an understatement to say that this has been a terrible week for @entity4 , and we have n't even reached the halfway point			1
on monday , @entity7 dealt a devastating blow to the @entity9 when it declined to recommend the device to consumers due to the antenna reception problem			1
@entity7 concluded from its tests that cell reception is indeed lost if you cover up the small gap between the two metal bands on the bottom left corner ( as it 's facing you ) of the phone			2
the media quickly picked up the story			0
tuesday was n't any better for the tech giant			0
@entity7 slammed @entity4 for not providing a fix to customers at no extra cost			2
some have even suggested that a recall was imminent -- an endeavor that would cost the company $ 1.5 billion			2
all of this news resulted in a sharp dive in @entity4 's stock price , although it has since made a partial recovery			2
there are even class action lawsuits waiting in the wings			0
@entity4 has a nightmare on its hands , and no software fix will make the problem go away			2
the issue has taken on a life of its own			0
the situation is n't impossible for @entity4 to recover from , though			2
however , the company needs to take action , and it needs to do it quick			2
here are what my top five priorities would be if i were in @entity54 ' shoes : 1			1
acknowledge that the antenna problem is real while you ca n't call the data conclusive , you can say that the data overwhelmingly points to one conclusion : the @entity9 has an antenna problem			1
the @entity9 antenna issue has been replicated in countless @entity63 videos and by multiple media organizations , including us			1
@entity4 's internal documents show that they know the issue is real			1
this is almost certainly a hardware issue , and it 's time that @entity4 stopped being coy and just admit that the phone does have an issue with its reception			1
the current string of denials and half - truths wo n't have any legs as the pressure mounts and the lawyers come knocking			0
the best thing the company can do is issue an open letter on the antenna issue , ideally from @entity54 himself			1
the key to making this go away is transparency			0
go into the technical details once @entity4 acknowledges the problem , it needs to give up details , such as the science behind the antenna issue , why the company did n't catch it during testing , and different potential fixes			1
do n't spare the public the complicated and scientific issues behind the @entity9 's design and how different grips affect reception -- anything less wo n't appease a critical public			1
roll out the software update @entity4 has promised a software update earlier this month to " fix " the formula used to calculate signal bar strength display , which the company pointed to as the root of the @entity9 antenna problem			1
while we believe that the software fix was meant to be a decoy to the real hardware issue , the company has already committed to the software update , and it should roll it out as promised			2
do n't keep trying to point to software as the problem , though : most people are aware that it 's not a software bug causing the antenna issue and treating it as such is just demeaning and condescending to @entity9 users everywhere			1
make the bumpers free out of all of my suggestions , this one is the key			0
those @entity9 bumpers may cost $ 29.00 in the @entity130 , but in reality the rubber and plastic mold only costs a fraction of that price ( possibly around $ 1 per bumper )			2
providing that accessory to customers for free solves the antenna issue , as bare skin has to touch the @entity9 's metal casing in order to drop signal			1
it 's not an ideal fix , but it 's far better than the other option : a recall			0
no matter what , do n't issue an @entity9 recall some have suggested that @entity4 should recall the @entity9			1
that is n't a simple affair			0
in fact , most users would be more annoyed and upset than pleased with the @entity156 - based company			0
let 's play out the scenario			0
@entity4 performs a recall of its devices			2
millions of people are annoyed as they either have to give up their device or keep a clearly defective one			0
@entity4 , already at peak production capacity , would take weeks -- if not months -- to replace the phones			0
estimates place the cost of a recall in the billions			0
here 's the truth : the @entity9 antenna issue is n't a hazardous one			1
it is n't exploding in people 's hands , it is n't cutting anyone 's palms randomly , and it is n't suddenly bursting into flames			0
those are critical issues that would require a recall			0
the antenna issue , while important and a problem that @entity4 should have found and addressed before the product 's launch last month , does n't rise to that level			1
recalls are meant only as a last resort			0
do you think @entity189 is going to recall all of its cars for a faulty radio ? @entity4 , while it may be feeling the pressure , ca n't cave to it			1
there is a balance here			0
it has to be truthful with what 's actually wrong with the @entity9 antenna and what is not			1
it has to keep its emotions in check as it discusses the antenna independent of the @entity9 's many other amazing features			1
and finally , the company has to give customers something to solve the issue			0
free bumpers seem like the appropriate middle ground			1
a recall is over-the - top extreme and hurts rather than helps consumers in the end			0

to stem the complaints and bad press over the @entity9 , @entity4 needs to take action quickly
here are what my top five priorities would be if i were in @entity54 ' shoes
the company should acknowledge the phone 's antenna problems are real
issue free bumpers to address the reception problem , but do n't recall the phone
