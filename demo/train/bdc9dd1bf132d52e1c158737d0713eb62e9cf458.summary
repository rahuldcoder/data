-- to resolve @entity7 's ongoing , bruising battle over the debt and deficit , @entity3 @entity2 @entity1 and @entity5 democrat @entity4 announced a deal on december 10 to halt spending cuts -- mostly in defense -- and lock in a two - year budget agreement to avoid another government shutdown on january 15			1
but in eagerly seeking agreement with the @entity2 who shut the government down in october , @entity17 risk hurting the economy 's fragile recovery by accepting too much budget austerity embedded in the newly adopted budget			1
president @entity22 and the @entity17 won big over the @entity2 in october 's budget fight			1
instead of pressing their advantage , @entity17 took tax increases for the rich off the table , agreed to cut federal pensions and did not get unemployment benefits extended			2
the democrats basically threw away their political gains			0
the deal repeals less than half of the sequestration cuts planned for 2014			2
if @entity22 and @entity36 continue their shortsighted obsession with austerity and budget cuts , they ignore the big economic lesson from the past several years : austerity hurts prosperity			1
the @entity43 estimated that repealing the entire 2013 - 2014 spending cuts would increase @entity45 by $ 113 billion and create 900,000 additional jobs next year			0
the october 2013 government shutdown took another $ 24 billion out of the gdp			0
unemployment remains stuck around 7 %			0
though the deal reduces a bit of fiscal uncertainty , it hardly affected the @entity7 growth forecasts for big banks , despite bank economists citing some pessimism because of " austerity shock " from spending cuts and " uncertainty shock " from @entity61 's continued fiscal battles			1
republicans bargain for more cuts and fewer taxes , but cutting military spending makes them nervous , so they attack @entity66 and @entity67			1
the @entity69 - affiliated @entity17 group @entity68 is helping			0
it launched an attack on sen. @entity72 , @entity73 , and others who rightly refuse to cut @entity66 as part of a long - term budget solution			1
we all know that @entity2 like to defend the wealthy and slash government			1
but why does austerity , especially cuts to old - age programs , have credibility with @entity22 and other @entity17 ? advocates of " grand bargains , " cutting programs to balance the budget , wrongly presume the budget is a fixed quantity			1
they imagine it like a fixed pie			0
programs for the young , like education , must be paid for by cutting other programs , like @entity66			1
but their belief that a dollar taken from the old will be spent on the young is not only divisive , mean and fierce -- it is wrong			0
in his december 6 speech on inequality , @entity22 talked about the sky - high and stubborn child poverty rate : more than 24 %			2
but cutting @entity66 and @entity67 will only destabilize the economy and increase the elderly poverty rate			1
in many countries , programs for elderly people are not traded off against help for the young			0
when support for old - age programs increases , so does spending on children			0
advanced democratic countries ' spending on the elderly is positively correlated with education spending			0
one analysis shows that a 10 % increase in spending on education is correlated with a 7.3 % increase in spending on pensions			0
the @entity43 warns that long - term deficits can hurt the economy			2
want to reduce the debt and deficit ? tax the wealthy , which wo n't hurt the economy			1
economists @entity127 and @entity129 estimate that raising the tax rate for the top 1 % as high as 80 % would generate far more revenue			2
sen. @entity132 , @entity133 , and rep. @entity134 , @entity135 , propose a transactions tax -- a three - penny charge on every $ 100 traded in the stock market , which the @entity43 estimates would raise $ 352 billion over 10 years			0
this small tax would also reduce stock churning by speculators , creating a nice secondary benefit			0
want to find even more savings ? sen. @entity146 , @entity147 , wisely put tax loopholes that cost the @entity149 almost a trillion dollars per year on the table			0
for example , @entity146 called for eliminating the small , but noxious , tax break for buying yachts and the $ 17 billion break that comes from taxing private equity , real estate and hedge fund profits as " carried interest " rather than at the ordinary income rate of 39.6 % instead of the capital gains rate of 20 %			0
there is one piece of good news : the deficit is coming down , from 9.2 % when @entity22 took office to 4.1 % of @entity45 in 2017			1
faster economic growth would shrink the deficit more rapidly			0
in contrast , further spending cuts will slow the economy and deficit reduction along with it			1
so , this is no time for @entity22 to accept a lower budget path , or to consider cuts in @entity66 and @entity67			1
the small budget deficit reductions in this deal -- less than one - half of 1 % of the total debt or $ 23 billion -- would almost pay for extended unemployment benefits for one year at $ 25 billion			2
@entity17 are flinching under continued pressure from @entity2 playing out their long game as they ready for another bitter fight when the debt limit is reached next spring			2
but the president and the @entity17 have a winning economic and political strategy : raise revenues and keep @entity66 and @entity67 strong			2
do n't throw october 's hard - won victory away ; it wo n't help the elderly , it wo n't help children , and it wo n't help the economy			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 and @entity194 .			1
