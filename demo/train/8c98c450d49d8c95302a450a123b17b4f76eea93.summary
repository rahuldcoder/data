@entity0 , @entity1 -- some answers may be revealed in blood - stained halls or deep in the rubble of @entity0 's @entity6			1
others may never be known			0
that 's the reality for investigators and the people of @entity1 on wednesday , still coming to grips with a vicious attack and armed standoff that ended a day earlier			1
at least 61 civilians and six @entity1 security officers died in the four - day attack and rescue efforts , president @entity18 said tuesday , but the death toll will rise as recovery workers retrieve bodies buried in the rubble of the partially collapsed mall			1
@entity1 forces killed five terrorists , and 11 others are in custody over possible links to the attacks , @entity18 said , declaring that his country had " ashamed and defeated " the attackers			1
but even though @entity18 declared the siege over , an immense amount of work remains to learn how @entity35 , a terror group thought to be badly bruised by recent losses in its @entity38 homeland , was able to pull off such a well - coordinated and brazen attack			2
president : mall siege attackers ' ashamed and defeated ' how did they do it ? it started saturday when the attackers stormed into the upscale mall and began shooting			2
a senior @entity1 government official said they took " very few " people captive ; the attackers were primarily out for blood			1
" they were not interested in hostage - taking , " the official said			1
" they only wanted to kill			0
" the attackers were equipped well enough to kill dozens of civilians , then fend off @entity1 security forces for four days -- not the sort of action that can be pulled off on a whim			1
that raises a number of questions : how could such a significant plot , involving travel arrangements , arms transfers and other details , have escaped the attention of intelligence officials ? did the attackers have inside help , either at the mall or within security forces ? so far , @entity1 and @entity76 authorities are n't answering such questions , certainly not publicly			1
@entity35 grew amid @entity38 's lawlessness @entity76 wants access @entity76 security and law enforcement personnel are pressing for access to the mall and the bodies of the terrorists so they can begin to determine if @entity76 were among the attackers , according to a @entity76 official with direct knowledge of the situation			1
" that is the million - dollar question , " the official said			2
" we do not have much fidelity on this			0
we have n't had access to the scene			0
" but based on what the @entity76 knows so far , " this was meticulously planned , " the official said			2
" this is not something where the attackers walked into the mall all of the sudden			2
" the @entity76 is looking at the possibility the attackers stored their weapons inside the mall ahead of time and may have even rented a store there as a base of operations			0
the @entity76 are also looking at reports the attackers may have had access to blueprints of the mall and knowledge of the location of employee and service personnel stairways as well as ventilation systems			2
@entity124 experts from the @entity125 are assisting @entity1 on a preliminary basis			2
they have specific expertise in analyzing explosives and fingerprints			0
but the @entity76 wants autopsy and forensic data , including dna samples , to help determine if @entity76 were involved , the official said			0
the @entity76 also will scour any communications or intercepts for clues , according to other officials			0
@entity76 experts also will try to analyze any evidence of grenades and heavy belt - fed machine guns being used , the official said			2
he noted grenade attacks by @entity35 are fairly common			0
the @entity76 belief so far is that @entity35 hard - line leader @entity146 ordered the attack , the official said			1
" nothing like this would have gotten off the ground without him			0
it 's safe to assume this is something he would have blessed , " the official said			0
who were the attackers ? @entity1 authorities have said 10 to 15 attackers were believed to be involved			1
one attacker was @entity163 and another @entity164 , @entity1 @entity161 spokesman @entity160 told @entity2 on wednesday			1
@entity35 previously had said @entity76 were involved in the attack , a claim @entity18 also noted tuesday but said has not been verified			0
@entity160 said wednesday that @entity1 authorities believe attackers of " a few other nationalities " were involved			1
@entity1 interior minister @entity169 told reporters wednesday that authorities can not confirm the nationalities of the terrorists until forensic testing is complete			1
he said the @entity76 , @entity174 , @entity164 , @entity175 and @entity176 are helping in the mall forensic investigation			2
@entity38 jihadists recruit in @entity76 , @entity176 and @entity179 reports that a white woman was among the terrorists who stormed the mall have prompted a slew of media speculation about @entity186 , a @entity164 woman whose husband was one of the suicide bombers in the 2005 @entity190 terror attacks			1
known as the " @entity186 , " @entity186 has been wanted by international counterterrorism officials since authorities found bomb - making materials in her @entity195 , @entity1 , apartment in 2011			1
she vanished shortly before a raid			0
was the " @entity186 " involved ? a senior @entity1 official said tuesday a woman was involved in the attack			1
@entity160 said wednesday that authorities ca n't say much about who the woman was or what she was doing			0
" what we 've been told by multiple witnesses is that they saw a woman			0
we have also been told that if it is the same woman that they say they saw , that she would have been killed very early on in the attack , " @entity160 said			0
" we do n't know for sure that we had a woman			0
and secondly , because of the bodies trapped under the rubble , we do n't know if she is who everyone says she might be			0
" where are they ? some of them are dead , inside the rubble of the partially collapsed mall , @entity18 said			0
but while he said five terrorists had been killed by @entity1 forces and 11 people were in custody , it was not clear if all the attackers had been accounted for , or if some may have been able to slip out in the chaos			1
a senior @entity1 official said forces were able to drive two attackers trying to escape by car back inside the mall , but it 's unclear if any others might have been able to elude authorities early in the crisis			1
others could have escaped by posing as civilians , perhaps after ditching weapons and changing clothes			0
how to help on wednesday , a high - level source who asked for anonymity told @entity2 that @entity1 counterterrorism police had arrested a @entity164 national of @entity38 descent who had injuries on his face and was acting suspiciously as he tried to board a @entity254 flight			1
it 's not clear if @entity1 authorities suspect the man of being inside the mall during the attack , but authorities found they had no record of the man 's entry into the country , the source said			1
there is conflicting information on the man			2
the @entity164 @entity268 told @entity2 the detained man is not connected to the terrorist attack			1
the office did not say how it knew that man was not involved and declined to elaborate			0
@entity18 , whose country boasts deep counterterrorism ties to the @entity76 , vowed to track down and punish the attack 's perpetrators			0
" these cowards will meet justice , as will their accomplices and patrons wherever they are , " the @entity1 leader said tuesday			2
the @entity1 spirit can not be broken , says eyewitness @entity2 's @entity284 reported from @entity0 ; @entity285 reported and wrote from @entity286			2
@entity2 's @entity288 , @entity289 , @entity290 , @entity291 , @entity292 , @entity293 , @entity294 , @entity295 , @entity296 , @entity297 and @entity287 contributed to this report .			0

there are conflicting reports on a @entity164 man held in @entity1 for questioning
