-- add @entity2 's news agency to the long list of those hoodwinked by the satire of the @entity6			1
@entity2 's semi-official @entity7 published a story friday claiming that a @entity10 poll found that rural white @entity11 prefer @entity2 president @entity12 over president @entity13			1
such a poll would indeed be big news in @entity2 ( and the @entity11 ) -- if it were true			2
but the source was @entity6 , the publication that presents the outlandish as real news			0
its serious tone fools many who are new to the lampoons			0
onion yarns have tricked news outlets in the @entity11 and overseas			0
@entity12 : i 'm quite popular what sets @entity7 apart from others , however , is that the agency published the @entity6 story as if it were its own			1
@entity7 used the story verbatim , giving the same headline : " @entity33 : rural whites prefer @entity35 " @entity7 also took all the credit at the get - go : " @entity38 ( @entity7 ) -- according to the results of a @entity10 poll released monday , the overwhelming majority of rural white @entity11 said they would rather vote for @entity2 president @entity12 than @entity11 president @entity13			1
" ( @entity6 story used a @entity45 , @entity46 , dateline			2
) the article went on to quote a @entity46 resident as saying he would rather grab a ballgame or a drink with the @entity2 leader than with @entity13			0
the phony resident then lauded @entity12 : " he takes national defense seriously , and he 'd never let some gay protesters tell him how to run his country like @entity13 does			0
" if that were n't enough , @entity7 continued , " according to the same @entity10 poll , 60 percent of rural whites said they at least respected that @entity12 does n't try to hide the fact that he 's @entity59			1
" a @entity7 news editor said friday that the outlet took the item off its @entity66 website once editors realized that the @entity6 was n't a legitimate news organization			2
without breaking from its farce , @entity6 editor @entity69 wrote in an e-mail that @entity7 is a subsidiary and has been " our @entity74 bureau since the mid 1980s , when the @entity6 's publisher , @entity75 , founded @entity7 with the government approval of the late supreme leader @entity77			2
" the @entity6 freely shares content with @entity7 and commends the journalists at @entity2 's @entity81 on their superb reportage , " @entity69 wrote in his statement			1
there 's no word on whether either president is laughing			0
@entity0 's @entity86 and @entity87 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 's semi-official @entity7 falls for an @entity6 story
@entity7 even steals the story , portraying it as its own
satirical paper jokes that poll finds rural white @entity11 prefer @entity12
once @entity7 discovered the farce , it removed the story from its @entity66 - *language* website
