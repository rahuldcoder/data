six tanks at the @entity2 in southeast @entity3 are leaking radioactive waste , the governor said friday , calling the news " disturbing " even as he insisted there are " no immediate health risks			1
" " news of six leaking tanks at @entity2 raises serious questions about integrity of all single tanks , " gov. @entity8 said friday afternoon on @entity9			1
@entity8 said that he got the latest information about the site during a meeting in @entity3 with @entity19 energy secretary @entity18			1
one week earlier , @entity18 called the governor to tell him that a single - shell tank in the same location was leaking liquids at a rate of 150 to 300 gallons per year			1
believed to be the first to lose liquids since 2005 , that tank was built in the 1940s and can hold roughly 447,000 gallons of sludge , according to the governor 's office			2
" ( @entity18 ) told me today that his department did not adequately analyze data it had that would have shown the other tanks that are leaking , " @entity8 said			2
the sprawling , 586 - square mile @entity2 site houses a total of 177 underground tanks full of radioactive sludge , of which 149 are single - shell tanks			1
on friday , @entity8 said there is " still no current health risk " tied to the leaks			2
he made similar comments a week earlier , saying " it would be quite some time before these leaks could breach groundwater or the @entity48			0
" at the same time , the governor stressed that the problem must be addressed			0
" this certainly raises serious questions about the integrity of all 149 single - shell tanks with radioactive liquid and sludge at @entity2 , " he said friday			1
hard lessons for @entity19 nuclear safety from @entity60 meltdown @entity61 became a focal point of @entity19 nuclear efforts beginning in 1943 , when aspects of the @entity65 were moved there			0
as local residents moved out , thousands of workers moved into the site where plutonium for use in atomic bombs was produced			0
two bombs were dropped on @entity74 during the final days of @entity75 the site -- about half the size of @entity78 , in an area centered roughly 75 miles east of @entity80 -- continued to buzz during the @entity81 , with more plutonium production as well as the construction of several nuclear reactors			0
the last reactor shut down in 1987 , though a mammoth cleanup effort remained to address what state and federal authorities deemed the most contaminated site in the @entity92			0
those efforts were bolstered by about $ 2 billion in federal stimulus funds authorized in several years ago			0
but decades of more work remain , which is why @entity3 's governor said he feared that across - the - board budget cuts called the sequester -- which could take effect march 1 , unless @entity101 passes and president @entity102 signs an alternative -- could negatively affect activity at the site			1
" we need to be sure the federal government maintains its commitment and legal obligation to the cleanup of @entity2 , " @entity8 said			2
" to see @entity2 workers furloughed at the exact moment we have additional leakers out there is completely unacceptable			0

last week , @entity3 's governor said 1 tank at the @entity2 nuclear site was leaking
he now says 6 tanks are leaking radioactive waste , calling the news " disturbing "
the leaks pose " no immediate health risks , " but do pose concerns , the governor says
*hanford* site is home to one of the world 's *largest* nuclear cleanup efforts
