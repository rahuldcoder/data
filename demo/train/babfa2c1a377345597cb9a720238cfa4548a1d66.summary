@entity1 and @entity2 representatives have had a front - row seat to the @entity5 investigation into the shooting death of @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9			1
they 've participated on witness interviews and got full access to grand jury testimony and evidence			1
but in the coming weeks , when local authorities announce the results of the investigation and a decision by the grand jury on possible charges against the police officer who killed him , do n't expect federal authorities to be standing next to county prosecutor @entity23			1
@entity23 has pushed for the federal officials to coordinate the completion of the separate federal civil rights investigation and to make a joint announcement , according to federal and local officials briefed on the discussions			2
local officials believe a united front would help reduce the potential for violence on the streets if the grand jury declines to bring charges against officer @entity37			1
justice officials have rejected the idea , in part because they believe a joint announcement would undermine their argument that the federal investigation is independent			2
5 crucial things about the grand jury investigation state and federal investigations are focused on separate legal statutes , federal officials say			1
a justice official says that the department " has informed the locals that the [ federal ] investigation will conclude when it 's ready not on an artificial timetable			0
" if , as is widely expected , the @entity5 grand jury declines to bring charges , the @entity1 could announce it will review the state investigation to ensure it was done properly , according to the officials briefed on the matter			1
rising tensions between officials local officials bristle that the federal government could do another review			2
that 's because the @entity1 and the @entity2 have sat through almost every interview , or have had access to transcripts from those interviews , according to government officials			2
the tussle has heightened an already tense situation in discussions among local , state and federal officials			0
all are concerned about possible violence in the wake of the grand jury 's decision			1
no one wants the blame			0
the manner in which the local prosecutor has presented the case is somewhat unusual for @entity5			0
@entity8 on edge as doubts raised over @entity37 indictment usually grand jury proceedings involve a couple of witnesses , but , in this case , there have been many more			1
and the prosecutor is presenting all evidence to the grand jury , including information that supports the account of @entity37			1
there is some cooperation between the federal and local investigators			0
the @entity2 performed some of the forensic tests that the state is using in its case			0
trying to heal a community - police rift but as the investigation into the shooting has continued , federal and state officials , along with members of the @entity9 congressional delegation , have been working on proposals to try speed reforms to improve a poor relationship between the @entity8 police and the mostly @entity119 community it is supposed to protect			0
among the those efforts is a plan in the works under which @entity123 would step down as @entity8 police chief to make way for the @entity126 to assume management of the smaller force , according to government officials briefed on the discussions			0
@entity132 's report on those plans prompted pushback from city officials who already were n't pleased by state and federal officials push for rapid changes			0
on wednesday , attorney general @entity139 said in remarks at the @entity141 : " i think it 's pretty clear that the need for wholesale change in that department is appropriate			0
" last month , the @entity1 publicly released a letter it sent to the @entity147 to prohibit city officers from wearing on - the - job wristbands with the words " i am @entity37			2
" @entity1 officials have also expressed anger at leaks that they blame on local authorities trying to manage the public perception of the case			1
another point of contention could come at the end of the grand jury process , when local officials want to immediately release all evidence that was part of their investigation			1
if federal officials are still conducting their investigation , they may oppose the release of sensitive information			0
complete coverage of @entity8 shooting and protests			0

local officials want a united front when a grand jury decision is announced
@entity1 officials have rejected the idea ; they want to appear independent
officials fear being blamed if violence *erupts* after the decision is announced
a grand jury is *deciding* whether to bring officer @entity37 to trial in @entity7 's death
