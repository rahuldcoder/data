" four weeks ago @entity24 put " no " at 58 % and " yes " at 42 % , @entity32 said			2
" the @entity41 campaign has not just invaded no territory ; it has launched a blitzkrieg , " he said			0

it also suggested that the " yes " vote was gaining momentum , while the " no " vote was losing it			2
negative campaign ? the @entity3 government , led by the @entity74 , says this is a " once in a generation opportunity " for @entity3 's people to take control of the decisions that affect them most			2
a " yes " vote means that " @entity3 's future will be in @entity3 's hands , " it says , and that life will be better and fairer for its people			2

@entity7 prime minister @entity88 wants @entity3 to remain part of an undivided @entity7 of @entity90 and @entity18			0

" there will be no going back , " he warns			0
@entity24 said voters felt that the @entity38 campaign had been negative , while @entity86 was " offering an optimistic future			1
