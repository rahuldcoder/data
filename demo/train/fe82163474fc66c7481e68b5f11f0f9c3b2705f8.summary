@entity0 -- the doctor convicted in pop star @entity6 's death is suffering possibly life - threatening and permanent injuries after almost a year in a small jail cell , his lawyers are warning			1
dr. @entity9 is housed in a high - security section of the @entity12 jail because of his notoriety , which isolates him from the general population for his protection but means he has " extremely limited access to exercise			2
" " death or injury at the hands of another prisoner , however , is no worse than a slow death caused by a loss of circulation and atrophy resulting from inhumane confinement of a large man in a tiny space , " lawyers @entity17 and @entity19 wrote in a letter addressed to @entity22 @entity21 wednesday			2
@entity9 invites @entity34 to visit him in jail @entity9 -- jailed since november 7 , 2011 , when he was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in @entity6 's death -- is 6 feet 5 inches tall , but confined in a 5 - foot - by - 7 - foot cell , the letter said			1
" if one were to keep a dog in a space just a few inches larger than the dog 's length , for any extended period of time , contentions of animal cruelty possibly leading to prosecution would likely result , " it said			1
the sheriff 's office did not immediately return repeated calls from @entity1 for comment			0
@entity17 , who is overseeing the appeal of @entity9 's involuntary manslaughter conviction , told @entity1 thursday his jail conditions " are the equivalent of a large individual flying coach in a middle seat for a period of a year			1
" @entity9 was taken to a hospital sunday night for treatment of what his lawyer described as " marked venous stasis of his lower extremities " and " right shoulder pain and severe loss of motion			1
" @entity19 's letter suggested the sheriff has " alternatives available to protect society and punish offenders that would not likely result in causing permanent injury or death to an inmate			2
" @entity81 law allows @entity21 , at his discretion , to release @entity9 under monitored home confinement			1
otherwise , he is supposed to remain in jail for another year			0
@entity9 was found guilty of causing @entity6 's death on june 25 , 2009 , by administering a deadly overdose of sedatives and the surgical anesthetic propofol in what he told police was an attempt to cure the singer 's insomnia			2
the doctor was sentenced to the maximum four years in prison , but he is eligible for parole after serving half of his sentence			0
a @entity81 law intended to relieve overcrowding in state prisons resulted in @entity9 being kept in the county jail			2
source of leaked @entity6 e-mails identified his cell there is so small that @entity9 has " no opportunity for physical movement throughout the day , " his lawyers wrote			0
" the only actual exercise that dr. @entity9 received occurs on most monday evenings when he is transferred in chains to an 8 - by - 8 cage on the roof of the facility			2
" @entity9 , in a phone call to a friend monday that was published wednesday by the celebrity news website @entity119 , complained that he feared his illness would be permanent			0
" i may never be able to wear a boot again , " he said			0
" the venous stasis gives rise to a high risk for deep vein thrombosis and / or migrating pulmonary embolism , " his lawyer wrote to the sheriff			1
" this condition may have developed to a chronic state which has become permanent and uncorrectable necessitating a lifetime of medication and treatment			0
" @entity9 's physical appearance has changed dramatically since he was taken into custody , his lawyer wrote			1
" a review of earlier booking photos and bio-statistics of dr. @entity9 , when compared to his current condition and appearance , would be shocking to persons not previously familiar with him , " they wrote			0
" to those who have known him for the last year or longer , the suffering that has obviously taken its toll on his health is unimaginable			0
" @entity146 drops effort to get $ 100 million restitution from @entity9 keeping a human in such conditions " would at the very least give rise to civil liability for negligent confinement resulting in a debilitating medical condition , " the letter said			1
" please consider this letter as notice of the life - threatening condition in which dr. @entity9 currently exists , " they told the sheriff			1
" correction of this intolerable situation is of extreme importance			0
" @entity9 : ' i feel like a pow '			0

keeping a dog in such a tight space would be animal cruelty , @entity9 's lawyer says
@entity9 suffers " marked venous stasis of his lower extremities , " his lawyer says
" please consider this letter as notice of the life - threatening condition , " he tells sheriff
@entity9 has another year left to serve in jail , unless released under home confinement
