-- @entity1 have completed the @entity2 and @entity3 double for the first time in their history after a hard - fought 1 - 0 cup final win over @entity9 at @entity10 on saturday			1
in a topsy - turvy match , which saw two penalties missed in a frantic second - half , @entity12 's superb long - range free - kick eventually proved the difference , as both sides wasted a host of chances to find the net			1
in a strange twist of fate , the final was played between the last two winners of the competition -- @entity9 ( 2008 ) and @entity1 ( 2009 ) -- but the similarity between the two sides ended there			2
@entity1 had sealed the @entity2 title with an 8 - 0 thrashing of @entity30 last weekend , while @entity9 had suffered a dreadful season in which they became the first @entity2 club to enter administration after accumulating huge debts -- subsequently finishing bottom of the table and suffering relegation to the second tier championship			1
and that gulf in class between the sides showed in the opening 45 minutes , with @entity1 remarkably hitting the woodwork five times as they peppered the @entity9 goal			1
the most glaring miss came from @entity47 striker @entity46 , who somehow contrived to hit the crossbar with an open goal gaping , after being superbly set - up by left - back @entity50			0
@entity53 's dipping long - range strike and @entity55 's looping header also struck the woodwork , while @entity12 gave notice of what was to come in the second half with a stunning free - kick , which @entity62 goalkeeper @entity61 somehow managed to get a fingertip to , with the ball bouncing onto the goalline and away			1
@entity9 themselves had a great opportunity in the first half , when @entity68 diverted a cross goalbound , only for goalkeeper @entity70 to instinctively scramble the ball clear			0
underdogs @entity9 began the second half with more purpose and should have taken a surprise lead			0
@entity74 out - paced substitute @entity73 , who had come on for the injured @entity75 , and was fouled by the @entity76 in the penalty area			0
however , @entity79 's weak spot - kick was hit straight down the middle , allowing @entity70 to save with his legs			1
and @entity9 were made to play for that miss just two minutes later when @entity12 found a gap in the @entity9 wall to fire his free - kick into the far corner of @entity61 ' net			1
@entity1 squandered further chances to double their lead , most notably when @entity53 missed the game 's second penalty four minutes from the end after @entity53 himself had been fouled by @entity94			2
however , @entity9 failed to trouble @entity70 's goal after that , although substitute @entity97 produced a couple of dangerous crosses from the left that caused panic in the @entity1 defence			2
after the game , @entity1 captain @entity55 paid tribute to his side , who join @entity112 ( 1961 ) , @entity105 ( 1986 ) , @entity106 ( 1971 , 1998 , 2002 ) and @entity107 ( 1994 , 1996 and 1999 ) as modern - day " double " winners			2
" this is an unbelievable feeling and to win the @entity115 with this group of players is just fantastic , " @entity55 told @entity113			0
" i thought our luck was running out with all those misses but it was a great strike from @entity12 and i thought we were worthy winners			0
" the pitch was awful , the worse pitch we have played on this season , but we played our football and managed to get the victory			0
" the result was also a personal triumph for manager @entity128 , who managed to achieve what no other @entity1 manager -- including @entity130 -- had achieved by winning the " @entity115 " in his first season in charge at @entity134 .			0

@entity1 complete a league and @entity3 double after beating @entity9 1 - 0 at @entity10
@entity12 's long - range free - kick proves the difference between the two sides
the match sees both sides miss penalties and @entity1 hit the woodwork five times
