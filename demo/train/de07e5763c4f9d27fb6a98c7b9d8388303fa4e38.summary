@entity0 -- @entity2 thumbs through his @entity3 as the sounds of voices and clinking glasses bounce all around him			1
his eyes never leave the phone 's screen			1
during @entity11 , @entity2 , 27 , passes the time with friends and management at an exclusive party in @entity16 before taking over the turntables			1
@entity2 lives in a world of rhythm and bass			1
he just ca n't hear it			0
ear infections at age 7 left @entity2 completely deaf in his right ear and took away 80 % of his hearing in his left one			1
it would be another four years before doctors would confirm what his mother , @entity29 , dreaded : her son was deaf			0
" it was heartbreaking as a mother , " she recalled			0
" it was probably one of the hardest days of my life			0
but @entity2 was the one who gave me a hug and said , ' do n't cry			1
' " originally from @entity38 , @entity29 and her husband , @entity39 , then a cruise ship chef , had moved to the @entity41 when @entity2 was 5			1
from childhood , he always had a " persistent personality , " @entity29 said , laughing			0
unlike many other kids his age , he always finished what he started -- from puzzles to cabins made from @entity49			0
after losing his hearing , his grades slipped because he had difficulty understanding his teachers			1
bullied in school , @entity2 usually kept his deafness a secret			1
when his parents suggested he attend a specialty school , he insisted on staying in public school			2
he worked with a speech therapist and began reading lips			2
" i grew up in a way that i do n't want any sympathy			0
i do n't want to be treated differently , " he said			0
" i just tried to maneuver around , reading lips and trying to hear my own way			2
" when her son announced he wanted to be a professional dj instead of joining the family restaurant business , @entity29 was cautiously supportive			0
" we could see his talent and his passion , but i kept worrying about that left ear , " she said			2
" anything to stop his dreams , he did n't want it			0
" hearing is the most important sense for a dj , who manipulates music , scratches records and uses mixers			2
but @entity2 was determined to succeed without his			1
always drawn to music , he discovered turntables in high school through a friend 's brother who was a dj. @entity2 got his first shot at performing as a dj at his father 's restaurant outside @entity91 , @entity92 , nearly a decade ago , and he has n't looked back since			1
" i still consider it as a hobby			0
i really do love it , " @entity2 said			1
" i do n't see it as a job , and that 's the best part			2
" @entity2 started out playing cds before pushing himself to scratch records , something he knew he needed help with			1
" it 's a hard business alone for the hearing community , " he said , " and i was like , ' i 'm hearing impaired and how 's that going to work ? ' " so he paired up with two - time @entity105 world champion @entity67 and @entity107 math grad @entity106 , aka @entity108 , who was teaching at @entity109 , a dj school and production studio in @entity0			1
mastering turntables is a skill that takes hours of practice to learn and can be a lifelong pursuit , @entity106 said			2
" it takes two years just to get bad , " he said			0
" and i mean ' bad ' meaning bad			0
" still , @entity106 was up to the challenge of working with @entity2			1
at first he did n't know what to expect , but he said @entity2 's success has surprised him			1
" on paper it should be impossible			0
you 're dealing with manipulating sound			0

" from the beginning he believed in himself and continues to believe in himself			0
" computer giant @entity128 noticed @entity2 's skills and put him in a commercial this fall for its new touch - enabled pc , thrusting him onto the world stage			1
( watch it here on @entity134 ) " it 's a true story of inspiration , " said @entity128 marketing executive @entity135			2
" his is a profound story of someone being able to do the things that matter to them and the things that they love through technology			0
" unable to hear lyrics or complete compositions , @entity2 relies on technology to see the music by using his laptop and dj software that helps him differentiate between vocals , bass and kicks			1
he also feels the vibration whether physically from a club 's speakers or through a @entity158 , which resembles a seat cushion and allows him to feel the music by directly transferring low frequencies to the body			2
clubgoers and promoters dubbed him " @entity165 " after he first came onto the scene in @entity92 -- a moniker even he uses			0
but @entity2 said he wants to be more than just " a deaf kid trying to @entity67 " " i want you to see me as a great dj who happens to be deaf , " he said			1
besides , he said , some things are better left unheard			0
" there 's a lot of sounds out in the world you do n't want to hear			2
i like it muffled , " he said			0
" i like who i am ; i 'm proud of who i am			0
" @entity2 has gone from working small clubs to rocking this year 's @entity179 and @entity180			1
