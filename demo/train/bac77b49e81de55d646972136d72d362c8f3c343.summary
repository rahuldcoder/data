@entity0 -- princess @entity2 , murdered ? by the @entity4 military ? pshaw , say royal analysts in reaction to news over the weekend of a newly revealed allegation that elite @entity4 soldiers were in on @entity2 's 1997 death in a @entity12 car crash			1
" i 'm in my 40s now , and as long as i 've been alive , every four or five years there 's been another documentary , another book about the assassination of @entity19 , " royal analyst @entity13 told @entity1			1
" and to some extent , @entity2 is rapidly becoming the new @entity19			0
" wildly popular in life and death , @entity2 died on august 31 , 1997 , after the car she was riding in slammed into a pillar in a @entity12 overpass			2
her boyfriend , @entity29 , and their driver , @entity30 , also died			0
investigators concluded that @entity30 was drunk and speeding when the accident occurred , and despite at least three inquiries -- including a lengthy @entity0 police inquiry that poured cold water on all forms of conspiracy theories in @entity2 's death -- whispers of collusion and cover - up have persisted			1
the latest claim , published by @entity44 , the @entity45 newspaper and other @entity4 media outlets , alleges that members of @entity4 's elite @entity49 commando unit were involved in assassinating @entity2			1
the claim appears to have been sent first to military authorities and then to @entity0 police by the parents - in - law of a @entity4 special forces sniper after his marriage had fallen apart , according to an article on the website of the @entity45 newspaper			1
it did not offer a source for its reporting , but the paper indicated that the parents were questioning the integrity of the soldier , who had testified in another soldier 's court - martial			0
sunday people said it had seen a seven - page handwritten letter by the in - laws alleging that the soldier , whom the newspaper did not name , had boasted to his wife that the commando unit was behind the deaths			0
neither the @entity45 piece nor an earlier version carried by @entity44 offered details of the claimed involvement by soldiers in the deaths			2
@entity0 police said saturday that its investigators were assessing the " relevance and credibility " of the information , but stressed tersely that their review did not amount to a " re-investigation			1
" a spokesman for @entity91 , the former @entity92 chief who led the department 's inquiry , said that " if anything new has come to light it should passed to its rightful place at the @entity98 ( @entity98 ) , who will no doubt look into the matter appropriately			2
" @entity102 officials declined to comment to @entity1 over the weekend , and the @entity4 @entity103 told @entity1 only that " this is for @entity98 to investigate			1
" the @entity105 newspaper quoted @entity106 , a former head of royal protection , as saying he was " mystified how any new information can possibly allege anything other than this was a tragic accident			2
" @entity13 , author of " @entity2 " and other books on the princess , likewise said he does n't expect anything from the new revelations			1
" that was one of the most intensive investigations ever carried out in this country , " @entity13 said of the @entity0 police inquiry into @entity2 's death			1
" and no matter how you looked at it , no matter what angle you looked at the conspiracy theories from , you just came up against a brick wall			0
" " it 's just not feasible that they would have carried out such an act , " he said of the palace and the military			1
" people do n't want to believe that someone as loved as princess @entity2 can just die in a road accident , " he said			2
" it just is n't enough			0
" @entity136 , royal editor for the @entity138 newspaper , told @entity1 's @entity139 on monday that it 's worth taking a look at the timing of the allegations -- just weeks before the anniversary of @entity2 's death			0
they also come about a month before the @entity4 premiere of a new movie , " @entity2 , " about the princess 's life			2
" it does prove , if nothing else , that 16 years on , @entity2 is still an irresistible news story , " @entity136 said			0
" she 's still selling papers , @entity155 , 16 years after her death			0
" rare photo of teenage @entity2 sold for $ 18 , 369 @entity158 reported and wrote from @entity159 , and @entity160 reported from @entity0			0
@entity1 's @entity161 and @entity162 also contributed to this report .			0

experts say they doubt claim published in @entity4 media about soldiers being involved
story of accidental death is n't enough , author @entity13 says ; " they want more "
claim alleges @entity4 military was involved in the death
the palace has declined to comment ; police say only they are assessing the information
