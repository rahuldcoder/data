-- the @entity2 's rating agency announced friday that it has downgraded the @entity4 credit rating to @entity5 + from its top rank of @entity7			1
" the downgrade reflects our opinion that the fiscal consolidation plan that @entity14 and the administration recently agreed to falls short of what , in our view , would be necessary to stabilize the government 's medium - term debt dynamics , " the agency said about the move , which was announced after the markets had closed			2
rating agencies -- @entity2 , @entity21 's and @entity22 -- analyze risk and give debt a grade that is supposed to reflect the borrower 's ability to repay its loans			1
the safest bets are stamped @entity7			2
that 's where @entity4 debt has stood for years			1
@entity21 's first assigned the @entity4 a @entity7 rating in 1917			1
@entity22 and @entity21 's , the other two main credit ratings agencies , maintained the @entity7 rating for the @entity4 after this week 's debt deal , though @entity21 's lowered its outlook on @entity4 debt to " negative			1
" a negative outlook indicates the possibility that @entity21 's could downgrade the country 's sovereign credit rating within a year or two			1
@entity42 , the head of sovereign ratings at @entity2 , told @entity0 that the political brinkmanship over the debt ceiling proved to be a key issue , with " the @entity4 government getting to the last day before they had cash - management problems			1
" few governments separate the budget process from the debt - authorization process as the @entity4 does , he noted			1
and , though the budget deal that finally was reached will deliver at least $ 2.1 trillion in savings over the next decade , that will not suffice , he said			2
" it 's going to be difficult to get beyond that -- at least in the near term -- and you do need to get beyond that to get to a point where the debt - to - gdp ratio is going to stabilize			2
" asked who was to blame , @entity62 said , " this is a problem that 's been a long time in the making -- well over this administration , the prior administration			2
" @entity14 should shoulder some of the blame , he said			2
" the first thing it could have done is to have raised the debt celining in a timely manner so that much of this debate had been avoided to begin with , as it had done 60 or 70 times since 1960 without that much debate			2
" @entity62 added that his agency 's decision is likely to have a long - term impact			2
" once you lose your aaa , it does n't usually bounce back , " he said			2
he pointed to the decision by @entity14 about whether to extend the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts as one crucial area			0
" if you let them lapse for the high - income earners , that could give you another $ 950 billion , " he said			0
@entity92 officials received @entity2 's analysis friday afternoon and alerted the agency to an error that inflated @entity4 deficits by $ 2 trillion , said an administration official , who was not authorized to speak for attribution			1
the agency acknowledged the mistake , but said it was sticking with its decision			0
the administration official called it " a facts - be - damned decision ... their analysis was way off , but they would n't budge			0
" but @entity62 defended his agency 's move			0
" it does n't make a material difference , " he said			0
" it does n't change the fact that your debt - to - gdp ratio , under most plausible assumptions , will continue to rise over the next decade			0
" rumors of a possible downgrade surfaced shortly after @entity120 prime minister @entity119 announced in @entity123 that finance ministers of the @entity126 industrialized nations may meet " in a few days " to discuss the sagging world economy			1
the @entity129 members are @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity120 , @entity134 and the @entity4			1
the announcement came on a day when financial anxiety gripped the globe			0
stock markets worldwide saw intense volatility amid worries of a widening debt crisis in @entity142 and a stalled economic recovery in the @entity4			1
stock market values fell across @entity145 and @entity142 on friday			0
@entity4 markets were dramatically up and down a day after having their worst day since the 2008 financial crisis			1
concerns about debt issues in @entity142 appeared to battle with optimism that a positive @entity4 jobs report indicated the @entity4 economy is not headed into a new recession -- the dreaded " double - dip			1
" " the crisis in @entity142 is quickly becoming on par with the financial crisis of 2008 , " @entity155 , portfolio manager at @entity156 , told @entity157			0
" the jobs report shows that things are n't getting much worse in the @entity4 , but the focus is clearly on @entity142 at this point			1
" the @entity167 index spiked 170 points in early trading on a better - than - expected jobs report , but then dropped by 200 points in mid-morning trading			0
it closed friday up 60.93 points ( 0.54 % )			0
the @entity175 closed down 23.98 points ( 0.94 % )			0
in @entity178 , the @entity177 closed off 146 points , or 2.7 % , to close the week down nearly 10 %			0
@entity133 's @entity180 fell 2.78 % to finish the week down nearly 13 %			1
and the @entity181 declined 1.26 % to finish the week off 10.73 %			0
" we are going to get through this , " @entity182 said prior to the downgrade at the @entity184 , where he announced a jobs program for veterans			1
" things will get better			0
and we 're going to get there together			0
" @entity182 , who spoke friday afternoon with @entity132 's @entity192 and @entity133 chancellor @entity193 about the crisis , noted that july marked the 17th consecutive month of private - sector job growth in the @entity4 , but said much more work needs to be done			1
@entity0 's @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 and @entity201 contributed to this report .			0
