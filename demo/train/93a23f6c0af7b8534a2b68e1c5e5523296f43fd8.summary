-- you may not know the name @entity3 , but you certainly know his very influential work			1
@entity3 is a special - effects giant			1
among the movies that feature his magic are @entity8 's " 2001 : a @entity9 , " @entity11 's " @entity10 , " @entity13 's " @entity12 " and @entity14 's " @entity15			2
" his creation of @entity17 , a hypervivid film process that combined large - format film with a high - speed frame rate , was a pioneering moment for film projection			1
even though @entity17 never caught on in @entity24 , it helped usher in similar technology used in the " @entity26 " ride that @entity27 ran for more than a decade at its @entity29 theme parks			2
an inveterate inventor -- he says he believes he has " 23 or 24 " patents and even devised an appliance to fix the @entity34 oil spill a couple years ago -- @entity3 has continued tinkering with image technology			1
though he sold @entity17 many years ago , he combined with its current owners to create " @entity38 , " a format that allows moving images to be shot at 120 frames per second ( fps ) -- five times as fast as the standard film speed of 24 fps			1
the high - rate images can be combined with those shot at the standard speed to offer particular detail to action scenes , which often blur images at 24 fps			2
now @entity3 is trying , once again , to expand the capabilities of movies			1
he 's in post-production on a short film to show off his new creation , a format that makes use of high frame rates , @entity60 digital detail , @entity62 imagery and large screens to create a theatrical experience he describes , proudly , as " substantially superior to @entity65			1
" ( he knows @entity65 -- he was an executive of the company when it merged with his special - effects shop			1
) of course , @entity3 has been here before			1
he had similar hopes for @entity17 , but was stymied when neither studios nor exhibitors wanted to make the investment in new equipment			1
in the digital age , he has hopes that there 's a market for what he calls an " immersive " experience			1
@entity0 spoke to @entity3 in a phone interview earlier this week			1
the following is an edited version of our conversation : @entity0 : what happened to @entity17 ? @entity3 : there 's been a bit of confusion about @entity17			1
the basic problem was , it was film and it was 70 mm and it was a lot of it , so the negative cost was very high , the print costs were very high , and it also required conversion of the projectors and theaters and a lot of costs			0
i just could n't get any traction in the theatrical movie industry to do it			0
@entity0 : so what 's @entity38 ? @entity3 : that 's where the confusion has come up			1
when i talk about it , they think i 'm talking about a revival of @entity17 , which it is not			0
i was contacted by the people who own @entity17 about three years ago and they asked : ' is there anything we can do with @entity17 that would be a digital version of it ? ' and i said i do have an idea for an invention that would be a method whereby you could change the frame rate on any pixel or any character or any object or any scene ... dynamically throughout any movie			1
so you could have a 24 - frames - per - second movie but when the car explodes , it 's 60 or 120			1
that turned out to be quite a unique idea , and we just did receive a patent on it ... and we got a patent under the rubric of @entity38			0
i think it 's becoming timely			2
@entity135 is a real big hero of mine because he had the nerve to make " @entity139 " at 48 frames per second			0
@entity0 : that film 's high frame - rate scenes looked like television to some critics			1
what went wrong ? @entity3 : high frame rates do make what you want fantastical to look raw and video - like			1
i agree that that 's a quality " @entity139 " started to assume and a lot of people felt really uncomfortable with that			2
( but ) i 've seen the movie all ways -- i 've seen it in @entity157 at 24 frames , i 've seen it in @entity62 at 24 frames , and i 've seen it in @entity62 at 48 frames			0
and because i 'm so adapted to it , i really like the 48 frames			0
@entity0 : do you think this is similar to when @entity166 went to hd and they had to develop various new techniques ? @entity3 : my take on it -- and i seem to be a complete lone wolf out there -- my belief over many years is if you want to make movies more realistic and more vivid , you have to think about the entire production differently			1
you have to write a script that 's appropriate to that experience , and you have to start thinking about your movie as a first - person experience , and not the third - person experience of normal cinematic language			1
@entity0 : do you think @entity182 achieved that with " @entity184 " ? @entity3 : i think he got much closer			1
i think " avatar " is much more appropriate to high frame rates because it 's like a ride and it 's futuristic , and vividness and sharp edges and clarity would be an asset			1
my personal feeling is that ultra-high frame rates and ultra-vivid giant screen movies can be like a window onto reality			1
and if you recognize it as such , you can write your screenplay , direct your movie , edit it and present it as a live experience -- not like a movie			0
that 's what i 'm doing it right now			2
@entity0 : does subject matter concern you ? when i think about " 2001 , " " @entity12 , " " @entity208 , " your special effects have a sense of awe			1
and i find that a lot more powerful than i do watching cars blow up			0
@entity3 : the important aspect of " 2001 " is it 's designed to be a first - person experience , very much of it			1
it 's like ( the computer ) @entity219 's point of view			2
@entity8 wanted to get out of the way and not use traditional melodramatic production techniques			0
it 's very much long shots that are n't much editorial intrusion			2
i think there 's one that 's 17 minutes long that 's purely visual , with no dialogue , no suspense , nothing else , except the experience of you , the audience member , feeling like you 're in space , going on this trip			2
that 's first - person cinema			1
i do n't think ( @entity8 ) ever anticipated or even expected that " 2001 " would play on television or make any sense whatsoever on television , because it really does n't			0
it depends largely on the spectacle of the giant screen and the immersiveness of the giant 70mm medium			0
i think we 're at a real transitional point where it 's time to start thinking about the possibilities of making a motion - picture experience that 's totally different from television , and much more immersive , and maybe not even compatible with it			1
if you want to get people to pay extra to go out to a theater , it 's got to be a spectacular experience they ca n't get at home			2
@entity0 : what are your thoughts on the film format ? @entity3 : i think film is great			1
i think film is not dead at all			0
i agree with some of the criticisms that people like @entity269 have			0
it 's probably true that the major studios have fallen into a blockbuster - tentpole syndrome			2
the problem is that has completely crushed out any innovation or any cinema opportunities for independent or inventive or unusual , nonblockbuster content			0
that 's pretty much left for television now			0
i think there 's an incredible opportunity now to experiment with what i generally call " hypercinema			0
" i feel because of the technical limitations in the exhibition business , the production values that ( the studios are ) paying for are not arriving at the audience 's eyes			0
it 's dim , the screens are small , the brightness is only 1/10 of what they see on television			2
and people unconsciously know that			0
you can look at your television or your computer and you 'll see a really vivid , bright image , with tremendous color saturation , and it 's always in focus and you can see it anywhere , anytime you want			2
@entity65 has proved conclusively that audiences will pay more for a superior and more spectacular theatrical presentation			0
the problem is that all they 're doing is blowing up conventional movies on to a larger screen			0
no one 's still thinking about it as a different medium			0
i think it 's a completely new thing			0
and i think the audience that pays for movies is completely ready for a new thing			0
when i was a kid , i used to see @entity321 movies and @entity322 , and it was in the days we had what we used to call roadshows , when we 'd have one spectacular @entity321 theater per town , not 50			0
at that time , even when " 2001 " first came out , there were only about 55 or 60 @entity321 theaters in the world			0
you 'd have a period of time where a movie like " 2001 " would run for months or epic movies like " @entity337 " would run for two years			0
and i think there 's no reason to believe why you ca n't do that again by providing a truly spectacular experience			0
what if you had a new kind of a movie experience unlike you 've anything you 've seen before , and it 's only running in one theater in each town or each region ? i 'm just interested in breaking the mold and doing something different , because i 'm tired of the same old , same old .			2
