-- @entity2 's lesser - known bridge unveiled a new look tuesday night			1
as part of a unique art project celebrating its 75th anniversary , the @entity5 span of the @entity6 has been outfitted with 25,000 led lights that will display a variety of undulating designs nightly for the next two years			1
organizers say it is the world 's largest light sculpture			1
" @entity17 has a very universal quality , almost anyone can see it and have some response to it			0
it 's operating on a very primal level , " said artist @entity21 , who has been working on the project for the past two and a half years			1
he says his goal with the @entity6 installation was to create a " digital campfire			1
" the utilitarian grey bridge cuts a striking figure in the bay and transports 250,000 cars a day , but it has never been a tourist attraction like the nearby @entity32			0
the @entity6 , which opened just six months before the @entity33 in november 1936 , ca n't compete with its neighbor 's iconic touches : epic views , vivid orange paint job and art deco detailing			1
@entity2 officials hope the @entity41 project will change that perception and boost tourism to the area			1
they estimate 50 million people will see the lights , and that the influx of tourists over the next two years will generate $ 97 million for the local economy			1
the project 's overall cost is $ 8 million , $ 6 million of which has already been raised by organizers			2
the @entity6 lights will fire up nightly at dusk and turn off at 2 a.m. every night until 2015			1
the energy - efficient lights cost $ 30 a night to power for those seven hours			2
@entity21 , who has works the @entity59 in @entity60 and the @entity61 in @entity62 , said one of the earliest mock - ups of the @entity41 project was a one - minute computer animation			1
he worked with @entity66 , producer @entity67 and a team of employees , volunteers and city departments to blow up those those tiny pixels into a huge computerized light sculpture			1
the final result is 25,000 led lights strung up along the 1.8 - mile stretch of bridge connecting @entity2 and @entity78			1
the individual lights are spaced 12 inches apart and each one can be set to one of 255 brightness levels			2
the designs @entity21 created and programmed to flicker across the bridge do n't include any images or text , and the sequence wo n't ever repeat itself			0
" what people will be seeing are abstract sequences which are inspired by the kinetic activity around the bridge , " said @entity21			0
" it 's not literally traffic or the water or any of those sorts of things			2
" the designs were also inspired by @entity21 's previous experiences in the @entity97 in the 1990s , when he worked in a research lab in @entity99 and attended the @entity101 festival			2
the result is an open - ended piece of art that @entity21 calls highly subjective			0
lights might dim slowly from the edges or shapes will unexpectedly dart across the surface like comets			0
the movements are playful , relaxing and unpredictable			0
" you can imagine anything you want in these lights			0
for me , it 's the mustache , " said @entity2 mayor @entity114 , who sports a signature tuft of hair on his upper lip			1
@entity114 was on hand for the opening ceremony , along with @entity122 lieutenant governor @entity121			0
while designing the sequences , @entity21 had to address practical issues like safety for passing boats and drivers on the bridge , as well as artistic considerations such as making sure the animations were viewable from up close , below the bridge , and as far away as @entity132 , where the bridge can been seen on fog - free nights			2
after obtaining permits and securing funding , trimming the bridge was the final daunting step of the project			0
teams worked from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. over the past few months to install the fiber optic network , choosing late night hours in order to have minimal impact on bridge traffic			0
they used custom clips to hang the lights on 300 vertical spans , mounting some lights as high as 500 feet			0
locals have caught peeks of the final product over the past couple of months as producers tested the lighting system ahead of the big debut			0
on tuesday , the hard work finally paid off as crowds of onlookers braved rain , cold winds and a few rogue waves to see the light display 's first official showing			1
artist @entity164 and her husband brought chairs , picnic food and wine to the show			0
others accessorized outfits and even bikes with blinking lights to celebrate the occasion			0
mayor @entity114 predicted an extended lifespan for the project , saying the city will want to keep the display longer than its two - year engagement			2
he hopes it will help give @entity2 the reputation as a location for world class art. relieved to finally hit the @entity187 button for the project after years of work , @entity21 is n't thinking that far into the future at the moment			1
" we 'll cross that bridge when we get to it , " he said .			0

@entity2 's @entity6 was has been trimmed in 25,000 led lights for a new art project
the light sculpture will display unique animations nightly for the next two years
two years in the making , the @entity41 project is expected to bring in millions of tourists
