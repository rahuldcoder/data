it 's been more than a century since @entity2 's residents were kept awake at night by the howling of tens of thousands of stray dogs			2
the dogs were rounded up and shipped to a deserted island in the @entity7 where they starved to death -- all part of a government - led effort to modernize @entity2			0
but the stories surrounding the so - called " @entity14 " are still fresh in the minds of @entity17 's animal rights activists			1
today , these activists are staging massive protests against a proposal to create " natural habitat parks " for stray cats and dogs in @entity17 's urban areas			1
these parks , they say , would really be concentration camps for stray animals			1
" it 's a law that might be killing hundreds of thousands of dogs and cats and little animals , " said @entity28 , a television personality who joined thousands of demonstrators , many of whom marched with their pet dogs , through downtown @entity2 late last month			2
" we are now the voice of these voiceless , wonderful animals			2
" supporters of the bill insist that the proposed law would protect these animals , who are left to fend for themselves on the city streets			1
" the purpose of the law is to ensure a comfortable life for animals and that they be treated well , " according to the government ministry that wrote @entity53			0
the ministry also said the law would " ensure that they are protected as best as possible from bad treatment , pain and suffering			0
" in recent weeks , animal rights activists have staged colorful , furious protests in @entity2 and more than a dozen other cities and towns across @entity17 , criticizing the proposed legislation in the starkest terms before it was even submitted to a parliamentary vote			1
" i am here only because i love animals			0
they are not animals for me , they are like my children , " said @entity68			0
@entity68 , an actress and singer from @entity17 films of the 1970s and ' 80s who sported brightly dyed pink hair , strained to be heard over the roar of a crowd of protesters in @entity2			1
" i 'm a soprano , i need my voice			0
but for animals i lost my voice ! " she yelled			0
the " natural habitat parks " outlined in the proposed legislation would be temporary homes for strays when there is n't enough room in animal shelters , until they are adopted , according to the @entity90			1
" they will be looked after , fed and sheltered , " explained the ministry in an e-mail to @entity95			1
the parks would be built on the outskirts of cities , and would be equipped with facilities for visiting school groups , as well as veterinary departments , according to the ministry 's blueprints			0
but some animal rights activists fear the natural habitat parks will become dumping grounds for stray animals , a charge the @entity110 bluntly denies			1
" as a lawyer , when i read the article , it says un-owned animals will be collected			0
which means to me any kind of animals you see around , even the ones i own -- if they run away into the street , it 's a potential animal to be collected , " said @entity115 , vice president of the @entity117 's @entity116			0
animals are furry fixtures on the street corners of nearly every @entity17 neighborhood			1
in @entity2 , @entity17 's largest city , it 's not unusual to see cafes and bars adopting strays as pets -- cats even take seats at bars to lap up saucers of milk , next to patrons sipping more fermented substances			1
the practice of feeding and caring for neighborhood strays extends to butcher shops and even street vendors			0
in @entity2 's throbbing @entity147 , @entity146 sells the @entity17 bagel known as " simit " from his car			1
next to him , a white dog basks in the autumn sun. " i love him by my side , " said @entity155 , who named the dog @entity156 , which means chief in @entity17			1
@entity155 noted that in recent weeks , municipal workers had collected at least five other stray dogs that he used to feed regularly			0
" if the state ca n't guarantee that they will take care of the animals , " @entity155 said , " then we are willing to take care of them			0
" @entity17 's government insists there will be no round - up of strays			1
" cats and dogs being rounded up , not the case , " the @entity174 wrote in a blunt , one - line response to an e-mail question from @entity95 asking whether it should be acceptable to have dogs and cats living in @entity17 streets			1
critics have also latched on to another vaguely worded clause of the proposed law that would limit the number of animals in a single household			2
some pet owners expressed fear the law would force them to give up their beloved animals			0
when asked about the proposed limits to pet ownership , the @entity110 responded , " the number and type of domesticated or accessory animals will be determined by taking into consideration the ecological needs of the animals , the conditions of the space , and human health			2
" one thing that both sides seem to agree on is the proposed criminalization of abuse of animals			2
" under the current ( animal rights ) law , the torture and sexual exploitation of animals only receives an administrative fine , " the @entity110 wrote			0
" the draft law proposes a criminal punishment of up to 2 years of torture which can lead to death , and up to 1 year for sexual exploitation			0
" @entity221 's animals abandoned and left to die @entity222 of charity 's money going to help animals @entity227 , @entity226 volunteers team up to help strays in @entity230			2

a proposed bill would create " habitat parks " for stray animals in @entity17
protesters *oppose* the measure , saying the parks would be " concentration camps "
supporters say strays would be fed and sheltered at the parks
@entity17 denies *allegations* that it is rounding up strays
