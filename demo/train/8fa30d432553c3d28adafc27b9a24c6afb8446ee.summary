@entity1 's guide to all things equestrian at the @entity3			1
dressage dressage has been featured in the @entity3 for a century now , and yet , for all its history many spectators are baffled by the allure of a horse prancing about in a ring to music			1
unlike some of the more flashy @entity15 sports , you wo n't find glitter , spandex or bulging muscles here -- save of course for those on the horse			1
dressage is an exercise in restraint , in beauty of form and synergy between horse and rider			1
here are some things to keep in mind while watching			0
less is more once the horse and rider enter the ring , all movement should come from the horse			0
the less the rider appears to be doing , the better the score			0
to the casual eye it may seem like the horse is doing all the work , but the rider is using every part of their body -- even minute shifts in weight -- to guide each movement of their mount			0
attitude dressage has its roots in the military training of elite officers and their horses , dating back hundreds of years			1
this has had a direct effect on the rider 's attire , but it is also reflected in the judging of the horse			2
look for calm horses with floppy ears and a relaxed demeanor			2
judges mark down for signs of a foul temper - which includes pinned ears , constant tail swishing , and foaming lips , which indicate the horse is not listening to the bit in its mouth			0
all the latest equestrian news here beat tempo and rhythm are the keys to a great dressage performance			2
each step should fall in a rhythm and as the horse takes strides it should fall into a tempo			0
dressage is often called ballet for horses , look for the horse that has the best beat and you may find a winner			1
@entity92 show jumping is one of the more dangerous @entity15 sports and it can also be one of the most exciting			1
unlike dressage where the horse stays grounded , show jumping involves navigating a course of jumps often as wide as they are tall , without taking longer than the allotted time			1
first impressions to the trained eye , an observer can tell a lot about a horse and a rider as soon as they enter the ring			0
how many sets of reins is the rider holding ? how many rings are on the side of the bit in the horse 's mouth ? if the answer is more than one , it can often mean the horse is as temperamental as it is talented			2
@entity124 to slow down for a show jumper , faults come from taking extra time but can also be caused by errors when being too hasty			2
a horse can not jump from a gallop because all their energy is focused forward and down			0
the energy to jump comes from the hind end of the horse - notice how the riders rock their horses back onto their hindquarters in front of successful jumps			1
jumping a clear course -- no poles knocked down -- requires navigating the balance of when to flat out gallop and when to collect and slow down			0
no @entity145 in show jumping there is no set route , only a list of jumps to be cleared in order coming from an assigned direction			1
this means that it is the rider 's job to decide how they will get from one jump to the next			0
tight turns and inside routes mean seconds off the clock , but can result in crashes and missteps if the horse does n't have time to see where it is going .			0
