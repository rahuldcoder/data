@entity0 -- @entity2 did n't experience war or genocide as a young girl in suburban @entity6			1
she has never received a death threat , and she has never seen a family member murdered			0
but the 49 teenagers she helps every week have			0
@entity2 , 24 , runs @entity10 , a nonprofit that provides support to young female refugees who have been resettled in the @entity0 area			1
" mostly , they are just normal teenage girls			2
we talk about celebrities and movies and books , " @entity2 said			1
" but then at the same time , a lot of them have lost parents who 've been killed			0
they 've seen bombs in their city			0
they 've lost people to disease and grown up in really dire conditions			0
" and when they arrive in @entity29 , often from war - torn places such as @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 , they face major challenges in building their new lives			1
" it 's hard enough to be a teenage girl in the @entity29			1
... it 's even harder to be a refugee teenage girl , " @entity2 said			1
" girls are , along with the rest of their family , learning the language , adjusting to a new culture , trying to get used to school			1
at the same time , they are usually in charge of taking care of their siblings or grandparents			2
they have to translate all the mail that comes , any bills , help go to doctors ' appointments			0
" @entity58 mentors these young refugees to help them adapt to their new surroundings , and it teaches them the skills they need to become successful , independent young women and productive members of society			1
all of the girls in the program are in the country legally , @entity2 said			1
most arrived with their families through the @entity71 , a government agency that offers assistance to refugees of special humanitarian concern			1
many of the families have fled religious or ethnic persecution , sometimes even torture			2
@entity2 first saw how hard it is for young teenage refugees when she worked with @entity82 , a girl who came to the @entity29 at 16			1
because of war , @entity82 and her family fled the @entity85 when she was 3			0
she lived in a @entity87 refugee camp along with her six siblings and her mother until they moved to @entity29			1
but when @entity82 arrived , she did n't know the language , and she struggled to adjust to her new surroundings			0
" it was so cold			0
i did n't have a jacket , " said @entity82 , now 20 and attending college			0
" i did n't speak @entity96			1
i could n't talk to other friends			0
... i was sad , angry , freaked out			0
" @entity82 desperately needed extra help in school , as well , and that 's when she met @entity2 , who was volunteering as a tutor with an organization called @entity103			1
@entity2 had been interested in helping refugees since she 'd been involved with the @entity106 movement in high school , and she started working with the group after college			1
but because of @entity82 's domestic responsibilities , it was hard to meet consistently			0
" she always got there really late and had to leave early to go home and cook dinner and take care of her younger siblings , " @entity2 said			1
" so i asked if i could start tutoring her at home			0
" @entity2 began making house calls to help @entity82 , even using her own money to take her out for fun			1
" we went to the @entity122 , the @entity123 ; she asked me if people eat the fish , which i will always remember , " @entity2 said			1
" early on , she really had n't been to many restaurants , and she was really nervous about it			0
... we also went to the movies and to see ( the musical ) ' hair ' when it came to @entity0			0
" as they spent more time together , @entity2 realized that @entity82 had dreams and passions but no idea how to make them a reality			1
" @entity82 wanted to be a nurse , but ( she ) did n't know what that meant or how to get there , " @entity2 said			1
" there 's just so much that you grow up with in the @entity29 that you do n't even think about having to learn , like , ' what is college ? what is a community college ? what is financial aid ? ' " @entity2 realized there were so many other girls like @entity82			1
so in 2011 , she used a $ 2,000 gift from her grandparents to launch a support group for refugee teens			0
she started with about 10 people , and the group quickly grew into what @entity58 is today			0
the nonprofit offers educational programs and job training to the girls , as well as a summer camp with field trips and fun activities			2
@entity2 often brings in guest speakers , such as nurses and financial advisers , who can bring practical knowledge to the girls			1
" we had people from a bank come and talk to girls about financial literacy , " @entity2 said			1
" this was informal , like what savings is and why it 's important			0
" it 's programs like these , as well as @entity2 's hands - on touch , that make her group appealing for families , many of whom are unaccustomed to promoting girls ' education and independence			1
she even visits families at home to discuss the details of the group in person			2
" in the beginning , sometimes families are skeptical of what we 're doing , " @entity2 said			1
" but we 've seen parents really come on board and like that the girls are coming here , because they learn important things about safety and they make friends			2
" do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2013 @entity209 one of @entity2 's early initiatives was to provide each girl with her own mentor to work with their individual needs			1
by october , she will have 20 pairs			0
these one - on - one relationships can be a valuable source of information and emotional support			0
" my mentor and i go to new places to learn about new cultures , " said 15 - year - old @entity220 , whose family fled @entity32			0
" she also helps me learn about transportation			0
we go do fun activities , but she also helps me when i have school projects			2
" @entity220 said meeting the other girls has been incredibly helpful , too , because of the common bond they share			2
" we talk about new movies , shopping , stuff like that , " she said			0
" but we also talk about some of the stuff we go through here every day , how we miss our home and what we would like to be in the future			0
" the group 's headquarters -- a cozy and colorful office space -- has become a place the girls can call home			2
" they often are sharing bedrooms with grandparents , younger siblings , " @entity2 said			2
" and this is a place where you can come and relax and read a book or use the computer and , you know , be around girls your own age			2
" @entity2 said it 's inspiring to watch the girls learn and grow			1
ultimately , she wants to help them enjoy their new lives and fulfill all of their dreams			0
" it is really important that the girls be able to go to college , but that 's not just the one goal , " she said			2
" it 's also about making friends and learning how to adjust to a new city and doing all these other things			2
" what i see is what all of the girls can accomplish and everything that they can do -- and that 's really why all of this exists			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity10 website and see how to help .			0
