-- @entity2 's @entity1 , @entity4 's @entity3 and @entity6 's @entity5 have done it			2
so have @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9			2
those heavyweights and many more were all speakers at the annual @entity12 : @entity14 conference , which begins tuesday in @entity15 , @entity16 , near @entity17			1
created in 2003 by tech columnists @entity19 and @entity20 of the @entity21 , the conference is a yearly showcase for tech industry leaders along with bold - face names from business , entertainment and politics			1
over the years , the conference has become known for both its consistent roster of influential web and tech figures and its relatively exclusive nature : it 's held at a luxury resort			1
@entity32 is limited , with past events being held to 500 attendees			2
( @entity0 will be attending the conference , dubbed @entity36 because it 's in its ninth year , and reporting whenever its speakers make news )			2
scheduled speakers include @entity42 ceo @entity41 , @entity44 ceo @entity43 , @entity46 president and ceo @entity47 and @entity49 founder @entity48			1
tech , web and social - networking companies have been known to roll out new features and gadgets at the conference			1
much of the speculation this year is centered on whether @entity6 will leap into the tablet computer field , aiming to compete with the @entity57 , @entity59 's @entity58 and various @entity61 devices			2
@entity62 , president of @entity63 , is scheduled to speak at the conference , and @entity64 cites anonymous sources saying he 'll be exhibiting new tablet software			1
the emerging mobile - payment space might also get some attention			0
@entity70 's @entity69 and @entity42 co-founder @entity71 , now ceo of @entity72 , are both scheduled to speak			1
both of those companies made announcements last week about apps designed to let people make and receive payments using their mobile phones			0
past @entity80 : @entity14 conferences have produced some buzz - creating moments			1
in 2007 , @entity3 and @entity5 sat down for a joint interview			0
in a particularly amusing segment ( in retrospect ) , @entity5 expounded on his ownership of a tablet computer and how such handheld slates could emerge in the future			0
@entity3 , who would roll out the @entity57 just over two years later , just listened and smiled before vaguely predicting more " post-pc devices			0
" last year , @entity1 's appearance at @entity92 brought him attention for all the wrong reasons			0
in an interview with @entity19 and @entity20 , he grew sweaty and visibly uncomfortable with questions about @entity2 privacy issues , ducking some of the questions entirely			0
the interview might have been a low - water mark at a time when @entity2 was under attack over privacy and security concerns			0
@entity1 's image would rebound in the following months with some smoother media outings , news of his generous charitable donations and , perhaps ironically , " @entity109 , " the fictionalized movie about @entity2 that many predicted would cast him in a negative light .			0

tech conference was started in 2003 by *technology* columnists from @entity21
