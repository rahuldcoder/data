-- i made my debut for @entity3 at the age of 21			1
it was a very special day in my life being able to represent my country , but unfortunately it ended after seven minutes when i tore a ligament in my knee			1
it was n't a great start to my international career , although i returned after nine months of rehabilitation			2
the most challenging part of rugby , i would say , without a shadow of a doubt , is the injuries -- and i 've had a few in my career			2
while you are going through it you do n't always see the light at the end of the tunnel , but i 've grown a lot as a person and become closer to my family and friends			0
a lot of the time you blame everyone for what happened to you but you just need to take it on the chin and work harder to get back to the top			0
i was pretty lucky when i grew up that i went to quite a good rugby school			0
i think the coaches i had were very good and they played a big part in my development as a rugby player			2
i think the 1995 @entity43 final was probably one of the best days in @entity46 history ( it was the first major sporting event to take place in @entity3 after the end of apartheid and @entity3 won )			1
it has got such a big part to play in uniting the nation and was definitely the best day that we 've had as a rainbow nation since 1992 ( when white @entity46 voted to end apartheid )			2

it was a fantastic day			0
it showed what sport can do to unify a nation -- and definitely what rugby can do in @entity3			1
when @entity3 won the @entity43 in 2007 , it was a bit different for me because i got injured in the first game -- and ruptured my bicep			1
even though i was part of the team and got my gold medal for winning , it was a bit of an empty feeling			1
i never really felt that i deserved it , but that was a great day , ( especially ) when the team arrived back in @entity3 to see the faces of millions of @entity46			1
i think that 's the pleasure you get from playing rugby -- to see the difference that you can make in the lives of others			0
i met @entity89 and took a photo with him and the @entity91 ( awarded to the winner of the @entity43 ) when we won it in 2007			2
he is an unbelievable person and i was very fortunate to meet him			0
he has a great love of rugby			0
it was funny , a couple of times he came to our games			0
let 's say of the five or six times he came , we played unbelievably well and won all of those games			2
he 's just got that aura to get the best out of any person			0

when i feel some of the calls are going against us my role is to be able to have a talk to the referee to get a feel for where we 're at and what we need to change -- maybe put a little bit more pressure on him to get the calls to go our way			0
playing under @entity3 's first black coach ( @entity136 ) was good for me			1
i played under him in the under - 19 team			1
he was a different coach , he had different methods and i think a lot of the time he was misunderstood			0
but i think it was great for @entity3 to have him there and he did a good job			1
it 's difficult to single out one guy who is my toughest opponent , but because i 've been playing for 10 years , i would say a combination of @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 and more recently @entity152 and @entity153 -- it 's always a great challenge playing against those guys			0
read related : ' @entity158 ' @entity157 driver lost both legs and triumphed with @entity161 gold i 'm quite proud to say that i 'm the most capped @entity3 center in the history of the game and i hold the record for the most - capped center pairing in @entity168 rugby with my friend @entity169 , so that 's a unique record , something that i 'm very proud of and also being the 54th captain of my country is quite special as well			1
these @entity174 ( the current series of three @entity175 matches against @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity178 ) are very important games for us to get a feeling as to the conditions we 'll be playing in in 2015 for the @entity43			0
we started this year with a new coach , a new captain and a lot of new players so for us it 's just about rebuilding a team and growing .			1

in 2002 , @entity189 suffered a major knee injury seven minutes into his international debut
he was part of the team which won the @entity195 but tore his bicep during the opening game
@entity189 was named @entity200 and @entity201 in 2008
the *31* - year - old is now the most capped @entity3 center in the history of the game
