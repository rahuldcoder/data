-- a growing pilot and passenger revolt over full - body scans and what many consider intrusive pat - downs could n't have come at a worse time for the nation 's air travel system			1
@entity9 , the busiest travel time of the year , is less than two weeks away			2
grassroots groups are urging travelers to either not fly or to protest by opting out of the full - body scanners and undergo time - consuming pat - downs instead			1
such concerns prompted a meeting friday of homeland security secretary @entity16 with leaders of travel industry groups			1
@entity20 met with the @entity21 and 20 travel companies " to underscore the @entity24 's continued commitment to partnering with the nation 's travel and tourism industry to facilitate the flow of trade and travel while maintaining high security standards to protect the @entity32 people , " the department said in a statement			1
federal officials have increased security in the wake of plots attributed to @entity38			2
industry leaders are worried about the grassroots backlash to @entity42 security procedures			1
some pilots , passengers and flight attendants have chosen to opt out of the revealing scans			1
more of the units are arriving at airports , with 1,000 expected to be in place by the end of 2011			0
" while the meeting with secretary @entity20 was informative , it was not entirely reassuring , " the @entity51 said in a statement			0
" we certainly understand the challenges that @entity57 confronts , but the question remains , ' where do we draw the line ' ? our country desperately needs a long - term vision for aviation security screening , rather than an endless reaction to yesterday 's threat , " the statement said			1
" at the same time , fundamental @entity32 values must be protected			0
" the travel industry is concerned that consumers may decide not to take a plane to @entity70 's for the holiday			1
" we have received hundreds of e-mails and phone calls from travelers vowing to stop flying , " @entity72 , an executive vice president of the @entity51 , told @entity73			0
a 2008 survey found that air travelers " avoided " 41 million trips because they believed the air travel system was either " broken " or in need of " moderate correction , " the @entity51 said			2
the decisions cost airlines $ 9.4 billion , the survey said			0
one online group , " @entity86 " calls for a day of protest against the scanners on wednesday , november 24 , the busiest travel day of the year			1
another group argues the @entity42 should remove the scanners from all airports			2
the @entity92 ( @entity92 ) , a non-profit privacy advocacy group , is taking legal action , saying the @entity42 should be required to conduct a public rule - making to evaluate the privacy , security and health risks caused by the body scanners			1
pilots ' unions for @entity100 and @entity101 are urging their members to avoid full - body scanning at airport security checkpoints , citing health risks and concerns about intrusiveness and security officer behavior			1
" pilots should not submit to @entity114 ( @entity114 ) screening , " wrote capt. @entity109 , president of the @entity32 @entity110 , in a letter to members this week			2
@entity116 represents more than 5,000 @entity100 pilots			2
" based on currently available medical information , @entity116 has determined that frequent exposure to @entity42 - operated scanner devices may subject pilots to significant health risks , " @entity109 wrote			1
@entity20 told industry leaders that biometric identification , such as retinal scanning and thorough background checks will expedite the screening of 80,000 passengers who participate in " trusted traveler " programs , the department said			1
in a blog posting this week , the @entity42 said pat - downs " have long been one of the many security measures @entity42 and virtually every other nation has used in its risk - based approach to help detect hidden and dangerous items such as explosives like the one we saw in the failed terrorist attack last @entity141			1
" the agency said only a small percentage of passengers end up needing a pat - down			1
" there 's nothing punitive about it ; it just makes good security sense , " the blog post reads			2
" and the weapons and other dangerous and prohibited items we 've found during pat - downs speak to this			1
" but the chorus against the security measures is getting louder			1
the website " we wo n't fly " urgers travelers to " @entity160 now			2
" " we are opposed to the full - body backscatter x-ray airport scanners on grounds of health and privacy			2
we do not consent to strip searches , virtual or otherwise			0
we do not wish to be guinea pigs for new , and possibly dangerous , technology			0
we will not beg the government anymore			0
we will simply stop flying until the porno - scanners are history , " the site says			2
" @entity178 , " organized by @entity179 , encourages solidarity on november 24 , amid the crush of @entity9 travelers			0
" it 's the day ordinary citizens stand up for their rights , stand up for liberty , and protest the federal government 's desire to virtually strip us naked or submit to an " enhanced pat - down " that touches people 's breasts and genitals			1
you should never have to explain to your children , ' remember that no stranger can touch or see your private area , unless it 's a government employee , then it 's ok			0
' " according to the group , passengers who say " i opt out " when told to go through body scanners are submitted to a pat - down			1
" be sure to have your pat - down by @entity42 in full public -- do not go to the back room when asked			1
every citizen must see for themselves how the government treats law - abiding citizens , " the website says			2
the @entity213 page of the group includes a litany of complaints about the scanners			0
" i 'm completely appalled by this , " one woman wrote			0
" what happened to our right to privacy ? has @entity57 forgotten our rights because they think its going to stop terrorists ? " meanwhile , the @entity226 has issued its own travel advisory over pat - downs many " describe as invasive and humiliating			1
" @entity230 women who wear a hijab and are selected for secondary screening because of a head scarf should remind @entity42 officers " that they are only supposed to pat down the area in question , in this scenario , your head and neck			0
they should not subject you to a full - body or partial - body pat - down , " the group said			1
the @entity42 has deployed nearly 350 advanced imaging technology ( body scanner ) units in nearly 70 @entity32 airports , administrator @entity244 said recently			0
" by the end of calendar year 2011 , we plan to have deployed approximately 1,000 units			0
" the agency is exploring enhancements to the technology			0
" this capability would make screening more efficient and would eliminate most privacy concerns about the technology , " @entity244 said			0
privacy concerns are n't the only reason for protests			0
some scientists and two major airline pilots unions contend not enough is known about the effects of the small doses of x-ray radiation emitted by one of the two types of airport scanning machines			0
the @entity42 's advanced imaging technology machines use two separate means of creating images of passengers -- backscatter x-ray technology and millimeter - wave technology			1
while the @entity42 says the machines are safe , backscatter technology raises concerns among some because it uses small doses of ionizing radiation			0
the use of millimeter - wave technology has n't received the same attention , and radiation experts say it poses no known health risks			0
the risk of harmful radiation exposure from backscatter scans is very small , according to @entity291 , director of the @entity292 at @entity293 and a professor of radiation biophysics			0
the @entity42 says the technology has been evaluated by the @entity298 's @entity297 , the @entity299 and the @entity300			0
@entity0 's @entity301 and @entity302 contributed to this report .			0
