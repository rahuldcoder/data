@entity0 -- growing levels of conflict , terrorism , and the toppling of regimes in the @entity8 and @entity9 , as well as political violence in @entity11 , are driving a rise in political instability worldwide , according to research by @entity16 risk analysis firm , @entity2 released on thursday			1
since 2010 , one in ten of the countries surveyed have experienced a significant increase in the level of short - term political risk			1
these risks include governments asserting control over natural resources , regimes being ousted by popular uprisings and the expropriation of foreign investors ' assets			0
the findings form part of the latest @entity31 , which uses 52 indicators to help companies monitor political issues affecting the business environment in 197 countries			2
since 2010 , @entity37 has deteriorated the most			0
it now ranks second compared with a 44th place ranking in 2010			0
@entity42 , @entity43 and the @entity44 also ranked in the top five			0
@entity47 has been downgraded to " extreme risk " for the first time as a result of violence following the ousting of former president @entity53 and an increase in terrorist attacks in the @entity56 , the report said			0
@entity2 warned that @entity37 , @entity47 and @entity57 are " now so bad " that they will be " mired in exceptionally high levels of dynamic political risk for years to come			1
" a fall in political violence in the @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 has contributed to these countries experiencing the biggest reduction in short - term political risk over the past four years			1
improvements in the level of governance has also helped to lower risk levels in @entity73 and @entity74 in the same period			1
social unrest the report said there is a higher chance for social unrest to exacerbate political instability in @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86			1
" this is due to the erosion of democratic freedoms , increasing crackdowns on political position and the brutality by security forces towards protesters , compounded by rising food prices and worsening working conditions , " @entity2 said in a statement			0
another concern for foreign investors is that there has been a major increase in oppression by governments worldwide			0
" this erosion of political freedoms is central to driving the wider risk of unrest and instability in the medium - to long term , " said @entity110 , senior political risk analyst at @entity112			1
in the short term , foreign investors face a heightened risk of becoming complicit with the actions of these oppressive regimes , which poses a threat to a company 's reputation , the think tank said			2
empowered youth instability increases as the gap grows between political freedoms and social gains , such as education and computer literacy among young people			1
in 2010 , prior to the the @entity130 , @entity57 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity37 and @entity47 were among the countries with the biggest divide between political freedoms and social gains			1
@entity2 predicts that the growing imbalance between social gains and political freedoms in @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 will heighten the risk of instability in those countries in 2014 and beyond			1
although @entity83 is categorized as " extreme risk " in @entity2 's ranking of oppressive regimes , the speed of the country 's governance reforms is likely to be sufficient to limit the chances of widespread social unrest that could lead to a " jasmine " revolution , according to the think tank			1
but @entity83 's increased scrutiny of foreign business practices has created compliance challenges for companies operating there , the report added			0
@entity2 cautioned that @entity86 's crackdown on social media and freedom of speech amid growing opposition may undermine the stability of the government in the long term			2
@entity167 has experienced a significant increase in the level of political freedoms over the past four years , according to @entity2 , and now displays a " near perfect balance " between the level of political freedoms and social gains , which reduces the likelihood of protests and disputes over labor conditions			2
political violence @entity11 countries saw the biggest increase in the risk of political violence , including terrorism , poor governance , and regimes vulnerable to popular uprisings			2
@entity40 , @entity43 and @entity187 scored in the " extreme risk " category , while @entity190 and @entity191 are " high risk			2
" @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity195 also saw a change in their risk category			0
three years after the @entity130 , more than 60 % of countries in the @entity8 and @entity9 region have seen a significant rise in political violence , demonstrating the long - term political risks associated with forced regime change , the report said			1
in the @entity208 , the impact of the global financial crisis continues to be seen in high levels of unemployment and underemployment			0
this , combined with austerity measures , has contributed to growing inequality and stalling or declining living standards , according to @entity2			0
political landscapes both in @entity217 and the @entity218 have become increasingly fragmented and polarized as populist parties flourished in response to growing voter dissatisfaction with established political parties over these issues .			0

new research finds the @entity8 and @entity9 , and @entity11 are political risk *hotspots*
the @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity228 , @entity74 and @entity73 saw the largest decrease in risk
more than half of countries are *classified* as ' extreme ' or ' high risk ' of limiting political freedoms
