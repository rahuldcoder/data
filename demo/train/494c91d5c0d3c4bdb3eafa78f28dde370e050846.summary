@entity0 , @entity1 -- few @entity4 presidents have been greeted with the enthusiasm @entity6 demonstrated for @entity7 on his election			1
in part , it was a reaction against his predecessor -- @entity13 was never loved in the @entity14 -- but there was also the feeling that @entity7 was a genuine multilateralist			2
@entity6 , who welcomed @entity7 as the candidate of change , did n't expect him to agree with them on everything , but they believed that he would at least listen to them			1
so now that the showroom gloss is beginning to wear off @entity7 at home , now that @entity4 poll respondents are indicating that the first dents and scratches are visible in the previously gleaming bodywork , how is he being seen between @entity28 and @entity29 ? in @entity6 's capitals , as in many places , there was something of a gulp when the @entity35 was announced , a feeling that it was being bestowed in hope of what was to come rather than in recognition of what had been achieved			1
that said , @entity7 remains far more popular personally than @entity13 , whose @entity43 adventure with the eager assistance of @entity46 prime minister @entity45 led to splits among @entity6 's leaders			1
on the diplomatic circuit , the movers and shakers will still fight for invitations whenever the president swings through @entity55 cities			1
on the plus side , there was a big welcome , except perhaps among some of the @entity55 states , when the president scrapped the missile defense plans with installations in @entity64 and the @entity65 , indicating that he wanted to talk to @entity66 rather than lob bricks over their neighbor 's wall			1
@entity6 , who do n't possess @entity4 's military might and who nearly always , in @entity74 's words , prefer " jaw , jaw to war , war , " also welcomed @entity7 's early overture to @entity76 indicating that if @entity77 would unclench its fist , then @entity4 was ready to extend its hand			1
after the strong influence the climate change deniers appeared to have with the previous administration , @entity6 were especially pleased that @entity7 said he would come to the climate summit in @entity88 , @entity89			1
they were impressed with the way he helped to broker a deal at the @entity94 summit in @entity0 in april , something he managed to do without throwing his weight around			0
it is a measure of the president 's continued pulling power that the @entity6 , who have seemingly grudged every extra pair of boots the @entity104 secretary general has persuaded them to dispatch up until now , are to stump up around 7,000 additional troops for the war in @entity107 alongside the 30,000 more committed by a president who has now more than doubled the @entity4 contingent there			1
but while @entity6 's diplomats and politicians know that the president , too , has to strike political balances , and while they recognize that shared values across the @entity116 wo n't always mean shared interests , a few niggles are creeping in			1
for all the talk about resetting relations between @entity120 and @entity66 , the @entity6 are worried that the crucial december 1 deadline passed without a deal renewing the @entity123 for monitoring nuclear arsenals			2
on @entity107 , @entity6 's political leaders were muttering behind the scenes as the president took a long time making up his mind about the extra troops			1
to them , he seemed to be dithering ; and with anti-war opinion building in their own backyards , he made their own lives more difficult while they awaited his decision			0
some criticism has come into the open			0
for example , @entity138 , @entity46 's defense minister , has refused to commit the @entity4 's leading ally in @entity107 to a pullout timetable beginning with the president 's promised date of july 2011			1
@entity144 , who knows a bit about these things as the international community 's former high representative in @entity149 , reckons that the president failed to produce a political strategy to go along with his military one			2
@entity7 , said @entity144 , was trying to appeal simultaneously to two different audiences			2
he wanted to tell the folks back home in @entity156 , @entity157 , that the troops would be home in 18 months , and he wanted to tell the @entity160 that an extra 30,000 troops were on their way to make life tough for them			0
the problem was that the folks back home would focus most on the extra 30,000 troops going out , and the @entity160 would focus on the fact that they would start leaving in 18 months			0
@entity160 leader @entity168 is supposed to have said : " the enemy has the watches ; we have the time			0
" insurgents tend to have a longer time scale than democratic politicians , who only too soon will be facing electors once more			0
the @entity6 , while they like much about @entity7 's style , are growing just a little uneasy about how things will pan out under his presidency			1
" it 's early days , but perhaps a little less talk and a little more do might be welcome , " one former @entity181 insider told me			0
they were n't expecting @entity185 in the @entity186 , certainly not at a time of major economic recession			0
they still feel that the new president is a man they can talk to			0
but they can see that power is moving inexorably from the the @entity191 to the @entity94 , where @entity6 's influence will be diluted by major new players like @entity194 and @entity195			2
they may become a little sensitive as the president is seen to cozy up to the new players			0
the @entity6 also can read the @entity199 surveys in the @entity4 showing that a greater proportion of @entity4 would like their nation to pull back from a world role and " mind its own business " than did so even during the @entity203			1
they will watch @entity7 now to see how he resists the pressures of isolationism			2
the slight unease one senses now in @entity6 's capitals is , in a sense , less a personal slippage for @entity7 than a growing recognition of the weakness of a debt - ridden @entity4 economy and of the inability of the world 's strongest military power to contain @entity220 insurgencies or to find and dispose of @entity221 and @entity168 eight years after the mass murders of 9/11			1
the @entity4 may still have the military might			2
but even @entity4 has to look at the costs column these days			2
and when the likes of @entity228 president @entity227 inveigh against the evils of the " @entity231 economic model , " they have @entity232 just as much in mind as they do the city of @entity0			0
@entity7 , though , does n't have to worry yet about his personal popularity in @entity6			1
he remains a beacon of hope to many @entity6			0
and he will probably remain rather more popular in @entity6 than he is at home because it is in tackling the back - pocket issues with their own electorates -- like health care -- that most politicians make their enemies			0
that may , however , be little consolation to a president with a second term to win in due course			0
@entity45 , after all , remained hugely popular in the @entity4 but so discredited did he become back home that he was forced to step down and hand over power to @entity252 .			0

president @entity7 was *widely* supported by many @entity55 countries
@entity7 's poll numbers in the @entity4 are dropping , though
@entity258 : @entity7 does n't have to worry yet about his popularity in @entity6
