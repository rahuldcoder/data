-- ancient @entity1 buried their dead with it			0
in 1848 , @entity4 flocked to @entity5 to find it			0
if you 're over 40 , your dentist may have filled your mouth with it			0
and @entity11 wants their 674 tons of it back from the @entity14			0
yes , we 're talking gold			2
atomic number 79 in the @entity18 , lustrous metal used for jewelry , valuable substance for electronic circuitry			0
where does it come from ? new results from studies of a gamma - ray burst -- an extremely energetic , fast explosion , typically from the distant universe -- suggest gold could be created in the collision of two neutron stars , which are kind of like two giant atomic nuclei			1
@entity0 : all the world 's gold came from collisions of dead stars let 's pause for a chemistry refresher			1
an atom is made of a tightly bound nucleus of protons ( positively charged ) and neutrons ( uncharged ) , orbited by electrons ( negatively charged ) -- a bit like planets orbiting the @entity49 , except instead of gravity , the electromagnetic force keeps the electrons orbiting the nucleus			2
( also the laws of quantum mechanics are important -- but that 's another story			0
) the identity of an atom is determined primarily by the number of protons it has			0
@entity61 has 79 protons , hence , its atomic number			0
that 's one more than platinum , two more than iridium , three less than lead			0
scientists think most of the elements lighter than iron ( atomic number 26 ) were forged in the dense cores of stars much heavier than our sun. at the end of their lifetimes , these stars explode violently in a supernova , dispersing the newly created elements across interstellar space			1
in fact , most of the elements that make up your body and everything around you -- other than hydrogen and helium , the two lightest elements -- were made by nuclear fusion inside a star somewhere , long before the @entity94 formed			1
physicists and astronomers figured this out in the last century			0
however , the heavier elements , including precious metals like gold , silver and platinum , or cell phone ingredients like copper , palladium , zinc , beryllium , and , yes , gold , were not made this way			1
instead , these elements were forged in stellar explosions , as extra neutrons and protons were propelled into atomic nuclei			2
like modern - day alchemists , nuclear physicists can in principle turn lead into gold using particle accelerators and nuclear reactors ( although it 's easier to turn mercury into gold )			1
but do n't get your hopes up			0
producing a small amount of gold costs enormously more than it 's worth so this is n't any way to get rich			2
obviously , nature makes gold , or miners would n't find it in rocks and streams			2
but nature does n't manufacture it easily			0
indeed , a supernova is more likely to turn gold into lead than the other way around			2
so now @entity142 of @entity143 thinks he might know where all this gold came from			2
scientists have suspected for a decade that some powerful gamma - ray bursts could result from the collisions of two neutron stars			1
because neutron stars are incredibly dense collections of neutrons -- basically , like a bizarre , gigantic , atomic nucleus -- smashing them together is bound to create atoms containing many neutrons and protons , including good old gold			1
@entity158 thinks the faint infrared light seen by @entity161 's @entity160 from a gamma - ray burst detected last month by @entity161 's @entity164 gamma - ray space telescope might come from radioactive decay of heavy elements created in the collision			1
during the collisions , neutrons captured by lighter nuclei should create such radioactive elements , which can then decay into other elements , producing the infrared light he saw			0
in addition to lead , thorium , and uranium , one of the ( minor ) by - products should be gold			0
could this be where your jewelry came from , the violent collision of two exotic neutron stars ? " to paraphrase @entity184 , " says @entity158 , " we are all star stuff , and our jewelry is colliding - star stuff			1
" so next time you put on that necklace , admire a gilded painting , or talk on your cell phone , pause to remember that it came from rare collisions of neutron stars in deep space			1
and figure that the next gamma - ray burst we discover might just have made as much gold as there is on @entity94			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity204 .			1

new studies suggest gold could be created in the collision of two neutron stars
@entity204 : most elements were made by nuclear fusion inside a star , but not precious metals
she says the next time you wear gold , remember that it came from deep in space
