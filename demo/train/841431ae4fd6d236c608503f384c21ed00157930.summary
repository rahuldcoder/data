-- the setup was bizarre			2
@entity3 officials whisked a @entity0 team away in a van , purportedly to go meet with a high - ranking government official			1
hours later , they arrived in the capital and were presented with three @entity9 held captive in the reclusive country			2
like virtually everything in @entity13 , the interviews were carefully managed by the regime			1
each man had exactly five minutes to speak			0
some of their statements seemed eerily similar			2
so what was the government 's motive in letting @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 address the world ? " first of all , their motivation always behind these interviews has been to gather @entity9 attention and then try to pave a way for high - level dialogue with @entity34 , " said @entity25 of the @entity26			2
during their interviews monday , all three men said they hope the @entity9 government will send an envoy to help get them out of their situations -- similar to how former president @entity40 helped secure the release of two journalists in 2009			1
" i do believe that ( a ) special envoy need to come in order to resolve the situation i am in right now , " said @entity21 , who is serving 15 years at a labor camp after @entity3 claimed he was part of a @entity46 plot to overthrow the regime			1
what might @entity3 want in return ? " their negotiating ploy with the @entity9 is to try to get us to agree to nuclear arms control , to sort of accept them as a nuclear weapons state -- which we ca n't do , " said @entity53 of the @entity26			1
another possibility : that @entity3 wants sanctions against the regime lifted			1
@entity63 , the @entity3 adviser to former president @entity64 , said the presentation of all three americans at once could be telling			1
" my guess is the fact that all three of them were put on tape for an @entity9 audience on @entity73 as a signal from the @entity3 that they 're looking for some sort of package deal to try to get them all out , " @entity63 said			1
" whether they 're trying to connect this to the long - style nuclear negotiations is anybody 's guess			2
" @entity34 responds the detainees ' surprise interviews with @entity0 's @entity84 on monday prompted renewed calls out of @entity34 for the men 's release			1
" out of humanitarian concern for @entity94 , @entity95 , and their families , we request the @entity3 release them so they may return home , " @entity89 spokeswoman @entity88 said , using the initials for @entity3 's official name -- the @entity3			1
she said the @entity9 is in " regular , close coordination " with the @entity102 in @entity13 , which acts as the " protecting power for issues involving @entity9 citizens in @entity3			1
" but it 's apparent the three men are now being used by @entity3 as " bargaining chips , " said @entity109 , a former @entity9 ambassador to the @entity110 who has traveled to the isolated country			1
" they 're sending a signal , saying , ' we 're ready to bargain for the three hostages , ' " @entity109 said			0
what the detainees said all three men said they have signed statements admitting their guilt			1
@entity3 officials monitored and recorded all three interviews , and @entity0 was unable to assess independently the conditions under which the men were being held			1
@entity21 said he is working eight hours a day , six days a week at a labor camp , even though he said his health has " been failing " over the past 1Â½ months			0
the 46 - year - old has diabetes , high blood pressure and kidney stones			0
despite what he called " hard labor , " @entity21 said he has been treated " as humanely as possible			0
" @entity9 officials have repeatedly called on @entity3 to release @entity21 , but to no avail			1
even former basketball star @entity135 , who has visited @entity3 and called its ruler @entity136 a " friend for life , " asked @entity25 to " do me a solid and cut @entity21 loose			1
" @entity139 , @entity21 's sister , told @entity0 on monday the video of his interview was " really difficult to watch			1
" " it is clear from the video that he is under a lot of stress			0
and he talks about his health failing and being in complete isolation for almost two years			2
and it is devastating for our family to see that on tv			0
" she also released a statement asking the @entity3 authorities to have mercy			1
" it is in your power to release my brother			0
you could do it today			0
please do so , " @entity162 said			0
" he has confessed to the crimes for which he has been charged , and he has served a longer detainment than any other @entity9 since the war			0
" @entity22 : ' my situation is very urgent ' dressed in a black turtleneck and often avoiding eye contact , @entity22 said he has admitted his guilt -- even though he wo n't learn of his charges until he goes to trial			2
" but i will say that i prepared to violate the law of the @entity3 before coming here , " @entity22 told @entity84			1
the 24 - year - old is accused of tearing up his tourist visa and seeking asylum upon entry			0
he expressed frustration that " there 's been no movement from my government			0
" @entity22 said he wanted to tell the @entity9 that " my situation is very urgent , that very soon i am going to trial , and i would directly be sent to prison			0
" " i think this interview is my final chance to push the @entity9 government into helping me , " he said			0
@entity23 describes ' desperate situation ' @entity23 , an @entity9 tourist accused of leaving a @entity189 in a hotel where he was staying , said he has " no complaints " about his treatment			0
" it 's been very good so far , and i hope and pray that it continues , while i 'm here two more days or two more decades , " the 56 - year - old said			0
@entity3 announced @entity23 's detention in june , saying he had violated the law by acting " contrary to the purpose of tourism			2
" " the charges are violations of @entity3 law , which stems from me trying to leave a @entity189 , " @entity23 told @entity84			2
" it 's a covert act and a violation of tourists rules			0
i 've admitted my guilt to the government and signed a statement to that effect and requested forgiveness from the people and the government of the @entity3			1
" @entity23 said with his trial expected to begin within a month , he is getting desperate			0
" you guys should convey my desperate situation , " he said			0
" i 've got a wife and three elementary school - aged kids that depend on me for support			0
" @entity0 's @entity223 , @entity224 and @entity225 contributed to this report .			2

@entity3 could try to use the detainees as leverage for nuclear talks
the regime surprised @entity0 by presenting the three men for interviews
all three said they have signed statements admitting guilt
*analyst* : @entity3 may want to use the 3 detainees in a " package deal "
