-- seriously , @entity2 fans ? just hours after @entity4 , a mobile app that lets users layer pre-programmed filters over their photos to achieve maximum hipness , launched on @entity12 's @entity11 operating system tuesday , the snark began			1
until then , the 18 - month - old app had been exclusive to @entity15 devices			1
" @entity4 went from a gated community to section 8 all in 1 day , " wrote @entity17 user @ joelby1328			2
that widely shared message ( surrounded by other gems such as " i 'm smoking with a ( expletive ) newbie ! she still has other people light her bowl for her ! ! ! " ) was as good a representative as any of a surprising number of tweets suggesting , or downright saying , that @entity11 phone users are in some way inferior to @entity2 owners			1
more than 1 million @entity11 users downloaded the app in the first 24 hours , and it became the talk of the town online			2
according to one analysis , there were 719,874 @entity17 mentions of @entity4 and @entity11 within the first 24 hours of the app 's release			1
many of them were n't exactly complimentary			0
" with @entity4 for @entity11 i can upload photos of abandoned beers on the backs of bar toilets right from my mobile phone ! " said a user whose screen name wo n't be repeated here			1
in fairness , even thousands of comments only represent a tiny portion of the folks who own @entity2 , @entity53 or ipods with web capabilities			0
but they highlight one of the @entity59 's most enduring ( and some would say annoying ) geek fights			0
conflict - minded @entity15 fans argue that @entity11 phones are less slick and uglier , and that they junk up the system with low - quality apps generated in its open developer community			1
@entity11 diehards counter that many @entity15 fans will blindly buy up anything the company produces and that the closed @entity71 system stifles creativity			2
" and that 's the most remarkable takeaway of this phenomenon , i think : that which smartphone we own has begun to inform our identities , " wrote @entity74 's @entity73			0
" in our gadget - filled lives , our phones have become another way for us to organize ourselves into separate groups , to label each other as ' other ' and ' apart			0
' our tech has come to define us			0
" while there 's definitely a " first world problem " aspect of squabbling about smartphones , as @entity11 continues to grow in market share , there may in fact be a class - war element at work here			0
@entity15 offers one @entity2 , with a price tag that ranges up to $ 399 and , in many cases , with an expensive monthly data plan to go with it			2
@entity11 , meanwhile , is available on a wide range of phones			0
while there are certainly some high - end models , such as the new phone - tablet hybrid @entity103 , @entity11 also runs on cheaper , less - advanced phones and on discount carriers instead of the handful of @entity15 - approved networks that the @entity2 can access			1
" so while there is often a tinge of irony or the hahahaha - colored patina of @entity126 in the proclamations of @entity2 users disgusted by the idea of the @entity11 barbarians at the gate , " wrote @entity120 at @entity121 , " under the surface is a more general tension between a population that tends to be more affluent and often manifests that affluence as a form of taste ... and one of the masses , a population filled with some segments that , generally speaking , have less of a voice in culture already , particularly in technology			1
" here 's hoping that the app snobbery soon fades			0
one sign of hope ? maybe @entity15 and @entity11 fans can band together in the face of a common enemy			0
wrote @entity17 user @entity11 on @entity4 while @entity140 just sits in the corner and cries			1

@entity4 launches on @entity11 , *prompting* snide comments from some @entity2 owners
@entity17 lit up with " there goes the *neighborhood* " - style tweets
@entity4 is an app that lets users *enhance* their photos with various filters
it had been available only for @entity15 devices for about 18 months
