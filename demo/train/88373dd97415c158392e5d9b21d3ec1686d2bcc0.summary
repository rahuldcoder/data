@entity0 , @entity1 -- as thousands of @entity3 gather in @entity0 this week for their party 's convention , hope and change need to make room for humility and contrition			1
there is a lot to be humble and contrite about			0
like @entity15 in 1992 , president @entity14 seems to be out of ideas			1
by any measure , this is a failed presidency			0
and @entity14 has compounded that failure by continuing to blame his predecessor for the situation he inherited , in a ploy that is well beyond the expiration date			1
the economy continues to be weak			0
many people are afraid of losing their job , their home and their life savings			0
we worry about the present , and we worry even more about our children 's future			0
a president who vowed to bring @entity37 together has driven us further apart with divisive rhetoric that fuels class warfare			0
meanwhile , @entity14 's foreign policy successes -- i.e. , the killing of @entity41 by @entity42 -- have been offset by the president 's indecisiveness in dealing with @entity46 and @entity47			1
and this administration has not been as good a friend to @entity50 , or as respectful to prime minister @entity51 , as it should have been			0
one of the biggest mistakes that @entity14 made in the last three and a half years was not taking better care of his base and adhering to the principles he espoused when running for the presidency			1
he has disappointed many parts of the coalition that helped elect him			1
after eight years of @entity63 , liberals and progressives thought they would get their concerns alleviated by @entity14			1
instead , when @entity14 began to embrace some of @entity15 's policies , some of his supporters ended up with new concerns			1
many on the left have registered their disappointments			0
civil libertarians winced when @entity14 emulated @entity63 's blueprint for fighting the war on terror , everything from suspending habeas corpus for terror suspects to domestic wiretaps to keeping open the military prison at @entity81			1
@entity82 are heartsick over the fact that @entity14 deported more than 1.5 million illegal immigrants ( most of them from @entity85 ) and broke up hundreds of thousands of families			1
teachers unions were upset when @entity14 adopted the high - stakes testing accountability model that formed the basis of " @entity90 " and rebranded it as " @entity91			2
" and gays and lesbians would have likely preferred someone who helped lead the repeal of the @entity96 over someone who merely announced that he had come around to personally supporting gay marriage			0
polls show that many @entity37 still like president @entity14 as a person			2
in august , a @entity103 / @entity102 poll showed that voters found @entity14 more likable than @entity105 by a staggering 23 points , 54 percent to 31 percent			2
but few seem to trust his abilities			0
the same poll found that @entity105 got the better of @entity14 when voters were asked who they thought was better able to fix the economy , 52 percent to 43 percent			2
will disillusioned @entity3 and independents who feel hoodwinked show up to vote for @entity14 in november ? that 's the question			1
as usual , former @entity117 presidential candidate @entity116 is sure that he has the answer			0
@entity119 told conservative radio talk show host @entity120 : " @entity14 wo n't be defeated by those who are angry with him			2
he 'll be defeated by those who are disappointed in him			2
and that is what this week is all about , inspiring the base to vote and cobbling together the same winning coalition that helped elect @entity14 in 2008			1
at this convention , there will be no need for @entity133 columns or @entity135 rhetoric			0
democrats ca n't re-capture lightning in a bottle			0
but @entity14 might be able to persuade just enough voters to take a chance again , and that would be good enough			2
to do it , he has to reconnect with everyday @entity37 by : -- showing that he " gets " it , and that he is ready to do something different in his second term than what he did in his first one , -- accepting responsibility for his failures , admitting his mistakes and showing that he has learned from both , -- uniting , inspiring and motivating the @entity3 base to turn out and vote despite his center - right drift on a host of issues , -- showing empathy for those who are suffering and giving them hope that things will improve			1
last week , in @entity160 , @entity105 needed to zero in on those who thought @entity14 had failed as president , but who were not yet sold on the idea of him as a replacement			1
he did some of that			0
this week , in @entity0 , @entity14 needs to speak to those who do n't like the alternative but still think he has come up short and needs to do better			1
we 'll see if he can do that			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity174			0

the @entity176 is held in @entity0 , @entity1 , this week
@entity174 : @entity178 and change need to make room for humility and contrition
he says @entity14 has disappointed many parts of the coalition that helped elect him
@entity174 : we 'll find out if @entity14 can unite and inspire the @entity3 base again
