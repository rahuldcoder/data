how would you like to do a search without touching a computer or phone ? or have your next question answered before you even ask it ? or get a reminder to pick up a carton of milk when you drive by a grocery store ? these are some of the new upgrades to @entity13 's search tools that the company announced wednesday at @entity15 , its annual developers ' conference			1
about two - thirds of web searches in the @entity19 are done through @entity13 , with @entity20 and @entity21 trailing far behind			1
we spoke to @entity13 senior vice president @entity23 last week about the new search changes and his excitement for a certain fictional starship computer			2
@entity27 gets voice commands @entity13 is adding voice - activated search to its @entity27 , allowing people in audible distance of a computer 's microphone to start a search by saying , " ok @entity13 , " out loud followed by their terms			1
@entity13 's search team is obsessed with the " @entity46 " computer , the fictional , omnipresent and invisible voice - activated system that answered questions and obeyed orders when @entity42 crew members began a sentence with the word " computer			1
" @entity23 called it the " ideal system			0
" swap out " computer " for " ok " and you get a clear picture of where the company is steering its search engine			2
to activate @entity56 , wearers say , " @entity57 , " followed by a request such as " record a video " or " @entity13 the life span of lemurs			2
" now that voice - activated , natural - language interface is spreading across all devices			1
" i ca n't wait to put my kitchen computer in this mode and settle all of our questions over dinner without having to pull our screens out , " @entity23 said			0
the new feature will roll out to @entity27 users across platforms over the next few weeks			0
search results add more context @entity13 processes more than 1 billion searches every day , 85 % of which have been googled before			1
all that experience means the search engine knows more than just the answer ; it knows what searches commonly happen next			1
now the search engine is integrating that predictive content into the answer , potentially saving people a step			1
" we would pretty much anticipate the next question you are going to ask , " @entity23 said			0
looking up the population of @entity88 ? according to past searches , the most common follow - up search is for the population of @entity92 ( if you 're wondering , @entity92 has slightly more people than @entity88 )			1
a population search could also show charts comparing similar locations and related statistics such as life expectancy and gross domestic product			0
the new feature also taps into @entity13 's @entity102 to make the necessary connections			0
the @entity102 is @entity13 's growing database of things -- you may have noticed its items showing up on the right - hand side of a common list of search results			1
where searches used to be largely based on the presence of keywords , the graph makes more concrete connections and detects relationships			0
for example , it knows " @entity121 " is n't just two words			0
@entity13 has associated the name with the 29th president and added it to a collection of @entity19 presidents			0
@entity126 adds reminders @entity126 is @entity13 's predictive search tool found in the @entity128 and @entity130 search apps			1
the tool pulls information from your calendar , @entity136 account , search history and phone 's location to serve up relevant information before you can search for it			2
these bites of data , called cards , might show the traffic for the morning commute to work , @entity143 reviews for a restaurant where you have reservations , and sports scores for the teams you look up the most			0
this week @entity13 is adding reminders to the mix. using your phone 's location , the reminders will pop up when you need them			1
a reminder to pick up frozen peas could appear when you are near the local grocery store , while a reminder to put gym clothes in the car could show up on your phone before you leave the house in the morning			0
these types of reminders are common in mobile apps			0
@entity172 , for example , has its own location - based reminders tool on the @entity174 and @entity175			2
the new reminders feature will be available for @entity128 first before eventually coming to @entity130			0
@entity13 also is rolling out a few more @entity126 cards , including ones that provide updates on music and movies			2
taken alone , these new features might seem minor			0
but together they add up to a new era of intuitive and predictive @entity13 search across devices , platforms and locations .			1

@entity27 will be able to begin voice - activated searches when people say , " @entity126 "
