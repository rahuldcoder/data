-- it 's happened to all of us			0
you wake up , have a bite , sip your coffee and then , full of energy and renewed optimism , you set off convinced that today will finally be your most productive day ever			0
delayed trains , crammed buses , gridlock traffic -- they 're all there to drain out your energy and hold you back from that promotion you feel you righteously deserve			0
but what if you could avoid crowded streets and ill - tempered drivers once and for all by simply taking to the skies in less than 60 seconds ? that 's the proposal put forward by @entity20 , a @entity21 visual artist and creator of the @entity23 , an urban aerial vehicle concept designed to help commuters whizz around easier and in a more green way			1
@entity20 's futuristic vision calls for a superlight personal helicopter that would be able to take off , fly and land while in autopilot mode			1
made from carbon , aluminum and titanium , the @entity23 would use a combination of fans and electricity - powered motors to fly two people at a maximum speed of 130 miles per hour			1
in addition , solar cells embedded on the aircraft 's exterior would allow it to generate energy during the flight and help it reduce urban pollution			1
" for most humans , a personal aerial vehicle is still just like a distant dream , " says @entity20 , 36			2
" but when you think about this , and mentally join some pieces , you can realize that the actual available materials and technologies can make possible for us to create this new reality , where a personal helicopter can be most efficient , economic , safer and easy to pilot than a common helicopter , and a smart way of transportation			0
" true , there are still many practical issues that need to be resolved before we can fly our commuting blues away			0
yet , @entity20 says , he hopes his concept would inspire creative people to come together and develop cleaner -- and more exciting -- ways of urban transportation			1
