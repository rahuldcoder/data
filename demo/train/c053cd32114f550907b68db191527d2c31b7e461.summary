@entity0 -- for most divers , a shark in the water can inspire fear , or even dread			2
@entity7 wanted to hitch a ride			1
more specifically , @entity7 was inspired by the shark 's constant companion , a remora -- a torpedo - shaped fish that commonly catches a ride by sucking onto the shark 's rough skin and thriving on the shark 's leftovers			1
@entity7 thought to himself : what if you had a camera as small as a remora ? what if you could stick a camera on a shark so that the shark goes about its life , unaware that its actions were being recorded away from the distractions of photographers in scuba suits ? where would it go , and what would you see ? for a naturalist , being able to observe animal behavior without interfering with the world the animal inhabits by the simple act of being there is the gold standard			1
in scientific terms , it 's similar to a control in an experiment			0
but that goal is usually unobtainable -- observing how an animal acts in captivity , for example , is no indication of how an animal actually behaves			2
observing that behavior in the wild , @entity7 says , is equally problematic			1
" when we 're in an animal 's habitat , they know we 're there , " he says			0
" and they 're reacting to us			0
" and knowledge of an animal 's actual behavior , @entity7 says , is absolutely critical to reaching the correct conclusions about a creature 's habitat and behavior , and how humans may be disrupting both			1
of course , the best way to observe real behavior in the wild is to have omniscient powers of observation , or perhaps a camera lens as long as your arm and as expensive as a new car			2
or you can see what the animal sees , courtesy of " @entity81			0
" twenty - five years after that underwater epiphany in the waters off @entity84 , @entity7 and his far - flung team of naturalists and engineers are getting closer to that gold standard			1
technology may finally be catching up with inspiration			0
@entity7 took his initial ideas for ride - along observation technology to the @entity93 in 1987			1
now he 's vice president of the society 's @entity94 -- an effort by a team of scientists and engineers working with researchers around the globe capturing footage of how animals behave in the wild , away from the interference of the observers			1
" @entity81 enables us to get out of the picture entirely -- to ride along , almost completely unobtrusively , to see their world and their behavior , " he says			0
@entity7 is a real - deal explorer , a tall , lanky , gregarious type who seems more suited to a dive boat in the @entity115 or a snowmobile in @entity117 than an impressively equipped machine shop in the basement of the fabled headquarters of the @entity93			1
@entity7 still gets more than his fair share of exploration -- a day after this interview , he was off to @entity117 , again			1
but more often he 's back in @entity0 , at his desk or in an edit bay			0
still , adventure is where you find it -- and sometimes , it 's in the most unlikely of places			0
cracking open a newly recovered @entity81 remora ( or box , or sphere , or whatever device his crew of happily mad scientists invent to capture hitherto - unwitnessed moments in nature ) is , for @entity7 , full of the rush of exploration			1
when @entity81 got its start , the results of all the hard work came down to a small , fragile tape			0
nowadays , the data is stored on a tough , solid - state memory card			0
but seeing the data of the first time , @entity7 says , is always a rush			1
" you start looking at the screen because you never know what you 're going to see			0
it 's completely engaging and captivating , " he says			0
the results , @entity7 says , run the gamut from inspiring and revelatory to downright boring -- at least , boring to a typical @entity158 viewer			1
but to a marine biologist like @entity7 , even the " boring " stuff can have stop - in - your - tracks potential			1
case in point : sperm whales			0
they are one of the deepest - diving species on the planet			2
years ago , his crew successfully attached an advanced @entity81 to a diving sperm whale			2
" the first 10 seconds are fascinating , because you see the whale diving down , " @entity7 says			1
" and then it dives down into utter darkness			0
and then we 're looking at a black screen for the next two hours			2
" but that @entity81 was also equipped to record sound , as well as video			2
and in that utter blackness ( sperm whales can dive almost two miles down ) , the @entity81 whale began a conversation with another whale -- a cascade of powerful , rapid - fire clicks			2
that whale conversation kept @entity7 and his editors transfixed			1
it was n't a made - for - tv moment , but it was yet more evidence that just about every deployment of the @entity81 system can reap unexpected rewards			0
in the frigid waters off @entity195 , a @entity81 captured an intimate view of a humpback whale calf nursing			1
there 's dizzying footage of a tree kangaroo ( yes , there 's a kangaroo that climbs trees ) high in the jungle canopy of @entity205			2
a sea lion in @entity207 plays with its food -- in this case , a hapless octopus			0
there 's even a brief glimpse of a great white shark swimming at eye - popping speed , chasing an equally quick seal			1
" you just never know what you 're going to get -- it 's just completely engaging , " he says with a broad grin			0
crittercam footage finds its way into many of @entity93 's nature programs			2
and the best @entity81 moments are a rare combination of good television and good science			0
that 's partly the goal of the whole program , @entity7 says			1
" i want to find a way to connect with people , i want to find a way to make them care about the conservation problem , " @entity7 says			1
" imagine a planet where there are no humpback whales , where there are no blue whales , no leopard seals , no leatherback turtles			0
can we survive ? absolutely we can survive ... well , probably			0
" is it going to be the kind of place we 're going to revel in , that 's going to inspire us ? i doubt it			0
as we know more , we 're going to care more -- and as we care more , we 're going to protect these animals and the habitats they depend on			2

for a naturalist , observing animals in the wild is *key* to learning about species
@entity7 *pioneered* the use of " @entity258 " mounted on animals
@entity258 record hours of footage that can be retrieved later
the cameras have captured whale calves nursing and a shark chasing a seal
