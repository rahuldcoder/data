-- every day , 10 women are killed in domestic violence cases in a country known for its glorious models , according to a new study released sunday			1
and it takes a high - profile incident -- such as the case against a @entity10 goalkeeper who is the prime suspect in the disappearance and murder of a woman -- to bring attention to the problem , said women 's affairs minister @entity16			1
the government - sponsored study , called @entity19 2010 , found that 41,532 women were murdered in @entity10 between 1997 and 2007			1
last week , @entity10 were shocked by the details emerging from the case of @entity24 goalkeeper @entity23 , who is accused of overseeing the kidnapping and dismembering of former lover @entity26 , with whom he fathered a child			1
@entity26 's body remains missing a month after her disappearance			1
and @entity23 has refused to answer questions on his alleged involvement , police said			0
" when cases emerge involving famous persons , " @entity16 told the official @entity34 , " that 's when society becomes aware of what is not being printed ... that women are violated , subjugated daily through inequality			1
" @entity16 said studies show that most women are victimized by men they knew well			2
@entity26 claimed recently , in a television interview in front of a police station , that @entity48 threatened to make her disappear -- and refused her pleas to acknowledge the paternity of their son			0
like @entity26 , who sought help from police several times before she was killed , @entity10 's women 's police stations -- which handle gender - based cases -- register an exorbitant number of complaints of threats that see no prosecution			1
@entity16 said that a law allowing gender - based crimes against women to be judged in special courts should have been respected in the @entity26 case			2
named after @entity69 , a woman who became a paraplegic after suffering numerous beatings at the hands of her husband , the law also allows for an aggressor to be arrested not only for the act of committing a crime , but preventitively			0
several other high - profile murders committed against women have gained national attention			2
attorney @entity81 's body was found floating in a man - made lake in @entity83 last month			0
the 28 - year - old 's boyfriend turned himself in and has been named a prime suspect			0
@entity87 journalist @entity86 was shot in the back and head in 2000			0
the main suspect , her former boyfriend , @entity90 , was a former director for the newspaper			0
according to local reports , @entity90 served seven months in prison .			0

study shows that about 10 women are killed daily in @entity10
41,532 women were murdered in @entity10 between 1997 and 2007
