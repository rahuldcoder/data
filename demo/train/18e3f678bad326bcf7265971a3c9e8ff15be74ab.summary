-- it could be an alien spacecraft or a 21st century version of @entity4 's @entity3 from @entity6 " @entity5 , " but in fact it 's a live - aboard , ocean - going laboratory that could be exploring the seas as soon as late next year			1
called the @entity9 , the part submarine , part research vessel is the concept of @entity14 architect @entity13			1
currently the centerpiece of @entity14 's pavilion at @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20 , it has spent almost 12 years floating around as a mere concept			1
it recently completed its industrial design phase and construction is slated for october this year			0
" all technical issues are resolved , all the modeling is done , " says @entity25 , education and media director of the @entity9 project			2
" we gathered institutional and industrial support five or six years ago and it 's been a real institutional and financial project for the last two years			0
" it is expected to cost around $ 43 million and when built , will be 58 - meters in height , taller than @entity38 , a monument in @entity40			1
when launched , around 50 % of the vessel will be below the water line , allowing for constant underwater study , @entity25 says			0
" one of the first users will be the science community , " he says			0
" it 's designed to explore the ocean in a new way , mainly spending time under the sea , giving people the opportunity to live under the sea for a very long time , to observe , to undertake research missions , like marine biology , oceanography and climate issues			1
" @entity13 's inspiration for @entity9 comes from ocean explorers like @entity60 and the experimental @entity62 underwater capsule laboratory that was used by oceanographer @entity63 in 1969			1
@entity64 is one of many vocal supporters of the @entity9 project ; others include former @entity69 administrator @entity68 and astronaut @entity70			2
the space connection does n't stop there as @entity9 has enlisted the support of the @entity74 and other industrial organizations to help develop the technology needed for the ambitious project and its onboard systems			2
designed to drift with ocean currents , the vessel will generate the majority of its power for life - support systems and propulsion to avoid other ships and storms from renewable energy , including solar , wind and wave power , @entity25 says			1
a side project is underway in conjunction with @entity93 , the @entity96 defense and space systems conglomerate , to develop a biofuel as the ship 's main power source			0
" it meets the requirements of today 's philosophy of sustainability , " @entity25 says			0
when built , the ship is expected to go to @entity105 -- the same place where @entity60 began his missions			0
" the larger education plan is explaining how important the oceans are in to the balance of the planet , " says @entity25 .			0

@entity9 is a unique , ocean - going research vessel
the vessel is designed by @entity14 architect @entity13
building of 58 - meter tall ship *due* to begin in october
