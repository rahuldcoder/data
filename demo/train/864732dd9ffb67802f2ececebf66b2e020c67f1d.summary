proponents of the law change , to scrap direct elections for mayors and governors , had argued local elections had proven too costly , and were prone to conflict and corruption			2
the bill was backed by the coalition behind losing presidential candidate @entity19			1
but critics disagreed , and questioned the timing of the bill , first proposed in 2012 , just two months after the election of @entity24			2
@entity25 , director of the @entity26 ( @entity27 ) , said that many were upset by the law change			0

but @entity24 has yet to take office and his opponents currently retain the majority in parliament			2
six of nine political parties supported the law change and most are part of the coalition that backed @entity52			1
" democracy has become too expensive , " @entity53 , vice chairman of @entity52 's @entity55 party , recently told a forum of journalists			1
@entity53 estimated the government would save about 60 trillion rupiah or $ 5 billion by eliminating direct regional elections			0
" if the regional election is done by the regional house of representatives , it is estimated that the expenditure needed would only be the cost for tea and coffee , " he argued			0

in 2004 , @entity134 became the first directly - elected president of @entity1			1
a year later , voters were given the right to choose their own local leaders for the very first time			1

direct elections favored a recent opinion survey by the @entity148 showed that 81 % of @entity1 prefer direct local elections			1
