@entity0 has arrived in @entity2 's orbit after traveling 442 million miles in the course of 10 months to get there			1
it wo n't land on the red planet but instead study @entity2 ' atmosphere from above to answer questions about its climate change , @entity5 says			1
@entity5 's @entity0 craft will live up to its formal name -- the @entity0 craft -- by helping scientists figure out how ancient @entity2 changed so dramatically into the planet we know today			1
it is the first mission devoted to studying the upper @entity2 atmosphere as a key to understanding the history of @entity2 ' climate , water and habitability			2
@entity2 rover reaches key destination ; ' new science ahead ! ' " the evidence shows that the @entity2 atmosphere today is a cold , dry environment , one where liquid water really ca n't exist in a stable state , " said @entity27 , @entity0 principal investigator , during a mission preview briefing last week at @entity29 in @entity30			1
" but it also tells us when we look at older surfaces , that the ancient surfaces had liquid water flowing over it			0
" so where did the planet 's water and carbon dioxide go ? @entity27 said @entity0 will help unravel that mystery by using its scientific instruments to measure the composition and escape of gases in the @entity2 atmosphere			1
@entity0 is to study the top of the atmosphere to determine the extent to which losing gas to space might have been the driving mechanism behind climate change , @entity27 said			2
@entity0 has company out near @entity2 , man - made and otherwise			2
@entity60 's first mission to the @entity2 , the @entity61 , is set to arrive a few days after @entity0 does			2
the director of @entity5 's @entity63 , @entity64 , says the @entity65 and @entity60 are interested in cooperating as their crafts gather data about the planet			0
there 's a visitor of the cosmic kind , too			0
@entity73 , which was discovered last year , will be closest to @entity2 about four weeks after @entity0 arrives			0
the comet is going to miss @entity2 by about 81,000 miles , said @entity27			0
" i 'm told that the odds of having an approach that close to @entity2 are about one - in - a - million years , " he said , adding that dust from the comet carries only a " relatively minimal " risk to the spacecraft			0
@entity0 will take advantage of the rare flyby by observing the comet itself , as well as its effect on the @entity2 atmosphere			1
interactive : exploring @entity2 from @entity86 to @entity0			0

@entity0 wo n't land on the surface but study @entity2 ' atmosphere from its orbit
why did ancient @entity2 change so dramatically ? @entity0 sent to get answers
@entity0 stands for @entity0 craft
@entity2 will be having plenty of other visitors : a spacecraft from @entity60 and a comet
