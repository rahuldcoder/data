-- confession : i 've fallen asleep while operating on patients			1
and i 'm sure i 'm not the only one			2
no , i 've never passed out and face - planted into a patient 's open belly			1
nor have i fallen asleep in the operating room as a plastic surgeon in practice			2
but as a resident , i performed the dreaded head - bob several times			1
here is a typical scenario : the or is silent , except for the rhythmic beep from the anesthesia machine			2
my surgical scrubs feel warm , like a pair of comfy pajamas			1
i sit , holding two tiny retractors , while the hand surgeon meticulously dissects the patient 's carpal tunnel			2
it 's a surgery i 've assisted on dozens of times before			2
i blink and try to remember what day it is			2
it seems like forever ago that i arrived at the hospital			2
in fact , it 's been more than 32 hours since my shift started			1
during this past day and a half , i 've logged more than 15 hours in the @entity14 and exactly zero minutes of sleep			1
my eyelids feel heavy , as if being pulled down by an invisible force			2
i begin shaking my knee up and down , an attempt to keep myself awake			2
" stay still ! " the attending surgeon growls			0
@entity39 returns to my eyelids			0
i 'm dancing on the edge of sleep			1
five minutes later , i lose the battle			0
my head briefly bobs down , then back up			0
has anyone noticed ? apparently not the surgeon			0
i look at the scrub technician , sitting to my right			0
she nods her head at me , knowingly			0
then she digs her heel into my foot			0
residency , the training to become a real , practicing physician , is brutal			0
during my surgical residency back in the late ' 90s , i was routinely expected to work up to 36 hours straight , without sleep or a designated break			1
sure , i occasionally caught a few zzz 's in the call room , but many nights were spent wide awake taking care of patients			0
i was one of the lucky ones			0
although often overworked , i never considered myself abused			0
some residents had it a lot worse			1
things are n't quite as bad today as they were 14 years ago			0
in july 2011 , the @entity70 implemented new resident work hour standards , instituting a maximum 16 - hour shift for postgraduate first - year residents , aka interns			1
these new rules have created concern among residents regarding their education			1
a survey published in the june issue of @entity81 found that surgical interns believed the new regulations would decrease their time spent operating , acquisition of medical knowledge , development of surgical skills and overall educational experience			1
so what 's the real benefit to reducing resident work hours ? the @entity94 survey also found that the majority of interns believed the new regulations would improve the quality and safety of patient care			1
as physicians , this should be our primary concern			0
proper residency training should n't necessitate working young doctors so hard that they 're forced to make patient care decisions or perform medical procedures while excessively fatigued			1
studies show that impairment in cognitive and motor performance when sleep - deprived for 24 hours is equivalent to having a blood - alcohol level of 0.1 %			1
this is considered legally drunk			0
do you want a drunken doctor operating on you ? as a physician , my patients expect me to be at my best when treating them			0
part of being at my best includes being well - rested			1
since my residency days , i 've never fallen asleep in the operating room			0
but it often disturbs me when i think about how sleep - deprived i was as a resident			1
more from dr. @entity124 : seriously ? doctors say they 're underpaid the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity124 .			0

many medical residents work long shifts and their sleep suffers
last year new standards were implemented with a 16 - hour maximum shift
@entity94 survey finds surgical interns believe new regulations inhibit education
