demanding " justice for @entity4 " and other african - americans killed by police , protesters hit the streets friday in eastern @entity6 , kicking off four days of demonstrations , discussions and civil disobedience			1
" today is not the start of an event , today is the beginning of your movement , " a man said friday through a megaphone , with protesters in the crowd echoing his words			1
" from this day forward , we say no more			0
" the event , which has been dubbed " @entity22 " and the " @entity23 , " centers on the 18 - year - old @entity4			2
@entity24 police officer @entity24 shot and killed the black teenager on august 9			1
authorities have said @entity4 attacked the officer and tried to take his gun ; @entity4 's camp contends the unarmed teenager had his hands in the air when he was shot			2
the dispute soon spilled over onto the streets of the @entity36 suburb , sometimes violently , as protesters and police clashed			1
that public discord has died down somewhat , though the events friday through monday aim to keep the demonstrators ' message out there -- both to demand @entity24 's arrest and to bring attention , more generally , to what they describe as racial profiling and police violence elsewhere as well			1
" our country can no longer deny the epidemic of police violence facing black and brown communities , " the movement 's website states			1
" @entity4 is now part of a long list of people like @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and countless others who have been unjustly killed by police			1
" the first event happened friday afternoon under rainy skies in @entity69 , about 8 miles south of @entity24			2
demonstrators picked this spot because it 's the office of @entity74 prosecuting attorney @entity73			1
for months , @entity73 has faced -- and resisted -- months of calls to push harder the case against @entity24 or to recuse himself entirely amid allegations he 's too cozy with police and not a good representative for the local black community			1
hundreds of people , many of them wearing rain jackets or carrying umbrellas , alternated chants of " do n't shoot ! " and " hands up " -- a reference to their claim @entity4 was shot with his hands high , in apparent surrender			1
a few people addressed the crowd with megaphones , before the crowd moved toward @entity73 's office			2
" @entity4 means ... we 've got to fight back ! " the spirited , if soaked , crowd chanted			0
@entity73 's office is presenting the case to a @entity74 grand jury , which could indict @entity24 on charges related to @entity4 's death or opt not to			1
the deadline for the grand jury to reach a decision is january 7			0
but @entity4 's death is n't the only one on protesters ' minds			0
there are also the high - profile deaths of men like @entity61 , @entity110 and others , who died at the hands of police officers across the country			2
that includes a shooting wednesday , just 12 miles from @entity24 in @entity36			0
protests erupted there after a white police officer fatally shot another black teenager			1
but this one was very different from the @entity4 case , because this black teenager was armed , according to authorities			0
many activists have expressed dismay not just at one particular case , but at what they characterize as a disturbing pattern of police being too heavy - handed , especially against blacks			0
that includes anger over how law enforcement handled protesters who hit the streets in the days after @entity4 's shooting			0
" i 'm fed up with ( what 's ) been going on in my neighborhood and this police brutality , " a @entity24 resident said at friday 's protest			2
" i 'm fed up with it			0
" four days capped by ' civil disobedience ' friday 's march was the start of four days of planned events in the same vein			1
demonstrators will invoke a @entity152 @entity151 tradition , and they will erect a @entity154 altar on friday night in @entity24 to memorialize @entity4 and the deaths of any other loved ones offered up by participants			0
the altars feature candles , flowers , and photos of the deceased			0
participants also plan to hold a silent candlelight march carrying a mirrored coffin 2 miles from the altar site to the @entity167 , organizers said			0
on saturday , activists and protesters plan to march through downtown @entity36 and rally at @entity171 in the center of downtown to " show our strength as we stand united against police violence , both here in @entity24 and across the country " and to send a message of " not one more , " organizers said			1
on sunday , several events will be held in @entity36 , including an evening meeting of " reflection and resistance " at @entity185 's @entity184 with author and professor @entity187 , rapper - activist @entity188 , poet and activist @entity190 , and rabbi @entity191 of @entity36 ' @entity192			0
on monday , a closing ceremony will feature participants removing items from the @entity154 memorial and taking them home " to seed work in their community , " said organizers , which includes the groups @entity203 , @entity204 , and @entity205			0
the organizers seek " to build momentum for a nationwide movement against police violence , " their website said			2
the official schedule also calls for " a series of actions throughout the @entity24 and @entity36 area " exercising civil disobedience			1
" @entity217 concedes nothing without a demand , " the organizers said			0
