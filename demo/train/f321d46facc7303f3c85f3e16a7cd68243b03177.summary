-- injured @entity2 star @entity1 is looking forward to taking his first steps towards driving again after passing a series of mental and physical tests in @entity6			1
@entity1 has been given the all - clear to begin training as he bids to return to the race track			1
his team @entity10 reported on its web site on tuesday that the @entity12 , who suffered horrific head wounds in @entity15 in july , had come through the tests satisfactorily on monday			1
" the checks ( which included neurometric , impact and cognitive capacity tests ) all had a positive outcome , just like the eye exam : everything is in order for @entity1 to get back to racing , " the statement said			2
" now there has just to be carried out some plastic surgery at the brain box , where the spring at the accident at the @entity31 hit his helmet			0
" the surgery will take place in the upcoming days			0
after a short convalescence @entity1 can then gradually start with physical preparations			2
" the 28 - year - old , who finished second in last year 's drivers ' world championship , said that he planned to take things slowly following the operation			0
" i 'm very happy about the results , " he told @entity43 before returning home to @entity45			0
" after the small surgery , in the next few days i can finally start to go to the gym to get back into shape and drive some tests in karts			0
" on the track with a @entity2 single - seater ? let 's take it step by step			0
at the moment i 'm concentrating on taking up physical activities , which is a great step forward			0
" @entity10 said @entity1 was expected to be at 100 percent fitness in time for the 2010 season , but gave no indication whether he would return to racing this year -- he has , however , indicated that he would like to drive at his home @entity12 @entity64 on october 18			1
his replacement , test driver @entity66 , is not expected to drive at the @entity68 @entity64 two weekends away after finishing last in his two races so far			1
@entity66 , who stepped into the breach when @entity2 legend @entity71 was unable to make a shock return to the sport due to a neck problem , was not allowed to test drive the current @entity10 vehicle during the four - week summer break due to this year 's regulations			1
veteran @entity68 @entity78 has been linked with @entity10 after finishing second at the @entity79 @entity64 on sunday , but his team @entity80 insist that he will race for them at @entity81			0
highly - rated @entity83 driver @entity82 is also in the running to replace @entity66 , with his team @entity85 dropping out of @entity2 at the end of this season			2
@entity89 's results aside , @entity10 have enjoyed a renaissance since @entity1 's injury , with 2007 world champion @entity92 winning in @entity79 to end a personal drought of 26 races and placing third in @entity95 .			1
