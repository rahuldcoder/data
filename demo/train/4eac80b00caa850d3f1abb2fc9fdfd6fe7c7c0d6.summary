the story would not be out of place on the tv thriller " homeland " : the @entity5 petty criminal turned double agent who receives $ 250,000 in cash for helping the @entity8 try to ensnare one of @entity10 's most wanted -- by finding him a wife			1
the wanted man was @entity14 - born @entity10 cleric @entity13 , who had become one of the most effective propagandists for the group			1
the bride - to - be was a pretty blonde from @entity19			0
the agent was @entity21 , who had long moved in radical @entity23 circles and had apparently won the trust of @entity13 during a stay in @entity26 in 2006			1
but unknown to his militant " brothers , " @entity27 had contacted @entity5 intelligence late in 2006 and offered his services			1
they had brought in the @entity8			0
and when @entity13 fled the @entity26 capital , @entity33 , for a remote desert hide - out , @entity27 became one of the contacts the agency tried to use to pinpoint @entity13 and take him out of circulation			1
the @entity5 biker and the trail that led to @entity10 's most wanted according to @entity27 's account , in a series of lengthy interviews with the @entity5 newspaper @entity44 , one of his many meetings with @entity13 took place at a desert camp in @entity52 province in september 2009			1
" he asked if i knew a woman from the @entity56 he could marry			0
i think that he lacked someone who could better understand his @entity59 mind - set , " @entity21 told @entity44			1
@entity60 , according to @entity27 , already had two @entity62 wives , but they lived in @entity33			1
he wanted a white @entity63 convert who could be his " companion in hiding " in remote tribal areas			0
neither the @entity8 nor the @entity5 intelligence agency @entity67 has publicly commented on @entity27 's account , and the story might seem implausible were it not for copious evidence shown by storm to @entity44			1
the evidence includes video recordings exchanged by @entity13 and his bride - to - be , communications from @entity13 , travel receipts and a photograph of a briefcase stuffed with $ 250,000 in cash that @entity27 said he had received from the @entity8			1

@entity94 , a pretty 33 - year - old with long blond hair who worked with young disabled people in @entity98 , had recently converted to @entity99 and become a fan of @entity13			1
after a series of exchanges with storm through @entity83 , she said she would be keen to marry the cleric , according to @entity27			0
he sent word back to @entity13 in @entity26 , and on december 11 , 2009 , the cleric got in touch , asking for more information			1
in a follow - up message three days later , according to @entity27 , @entity13 relayed this message to her : " i will make a few things clear			1
firstly , i do n't live in a fixed location , and therefore my living conditions are varied			0
sometimes i live in a tent			0
secondly , i sometimes have to live isolated from others , which means that i and my family can not meet other people			0
if you can live in these difficult conditions , and do not mind solitude and restrictions in your communication with the outside world , it is excellent			0
" @entity60 may have expected his living conditions to deteriorate			1
a few days later -- on christmas day 2009 -- a @entity131 student recruited by @entity13 in @entity26 tried to blow up an airliner over @entity133 with an explosive device hidden in his underwear			1
the attack would bring new urgency to efforts to track down @entity13			2

the @entity5 , he told @entity44 , contacted the @entity8 , which saw an opportunity to try to find the terrorist cleric			1
the plan the @entity8 and @entity67 settled on , according to @entity27 , was to plant a tracking device in @entity94 's suitcase			1
" it was intended that she could lead us to @entity13			2
@entity67 was there all along , and knew the consequences if the plan succeeded , namely that @entity13 likely would be killed , and that there was a risk that @entity94 would also go up in smoke , " @entity21 told @entity44			1
on february 17 , 2010 , @entity13 got in touch with @entity27 suggesting he meet @entity94 : " if you visit her , i can upload a video recording of myself as ( an ) encrypted file , and you can get her to hear it , so she is sure that ( it ) is me , " the cleric wrote			1
in a follow - up message several days later , @entity13 told storm to tell @entity94 his living conditions had improved			2

i 'm not leaving the house , and am in a situation for my wife to be with me all the time			0
i prefer this residence ( to ) a tent in the mountains , because it gives me ability to read , write and research			0
" storm says that after receiving that message , he met with his @entity67 and @entity8 handlers in the @entity5 town of @entity189			2
he says a longtime @entity8 contact in @entity5 called @entity191 and a @entity8 official who had flown in from @entity193 and called himself @entity194 were present			2

at a second meeting in @entity197 , @entity27 showed @entity94 a short video recording made by @entity13 , who was dressed in white robes in front of a pink background with a floral motif			2
" this recording is done specifically for @entity94 at her request ... i pray @entity220 guides to that which is best for you in this life and in the hereafter			0
and guides you to choose what is better for you regarding this proposal , " @entity13 said , in a section posted on the @entity44 website			2
storm said @entity94 burst into tears when she heard these words			0
read more about @entity10 on @entity237 's @entity236 blog she then recorded two short videos for @entity13			1
in the first video , she wore a full black veil with just her face visible			0
speaking in heavily accented @entity241 , she said : " i will accept everything that is needed to do now this way that i have chosen and inshallah @entity220 will help us			0
" in the second video , @entity94 took off her veil and said : " brother , it 's me without the scarf , so you can see my hair ... i hope you are happy with me , inshallah , " according to @entity44			0
at the same meeting , @entity27 handed @entity94 a suitcase that had been rigged with a tracking device			1
on may 18 , 2010 , @entity27 traveled to @entity197 a third time to buy @entity94 's plane ticket to @entity26 and hand over $ 3,000 in cash on behalf of @entity13 , he told @entity44			2
@entity94 and the suitcase arrived in @entity33 at the beginning of june , and @entity27 's work was done			0
two days later , one of his @entity5 intelligence handlers texted him : " congratulations brother , you just got rich , very rich , " @entity44 published the text sunday on its website			2

" what 's the code ? " storm asked			0
" try 007 , " the agent responded			0
but the plot did n't work			0
@entity94 spent several weeks in @entity33 , and then a messenger arrived to arrange her travel to meet @entity13			2
for security reasons -- among them concerns about tracking devices -- she was told to leave her suitcase behind			2
@entity94 and @entity13 married shortly afterward			2
@entity60 sent storm a message thanking him for arranging the marriage			2
she had not only lived up to expectations , @entity13 wrote in a message viewed by @entity44 , but was " ...			2
much better ! " last year , when @entity27 returned to @entity26 on what he described as another mission for @entity5 intelligence , he and @entity290 exchanged several messages			2
in one obtained by @entity44 , @entity13 requested that @entity27 send products from @entity33 for his new wife , including hair conditioner			1
@entity60 was eventually tracked down and killed in a drone strike at the end of september of last year			1

analysis : @entity10 's rock star no more but in a conversation taped by @entity27 at a @entity189 hotel late last year , an @entity14 called @entity309 insisted that a separate stream of intelligence had led to @entity13			1
storm did n't believe him			0
" i am convinced that the @entity8 seized the messenger ... but the @entity14 apparently wo n't recognize that it was an agent of @entity67 and the small country , @entity5 , which led to the detection of @entity13 , " he told @entity44			1
after @entity13 's death , @entity94 continued to communicate with storm through encrypted messages , unaware that he had been working with @entity59 intelligence			1
a few months ago , she said she was working on @entity321 , the online magazine of @entity322 , or @entity322			0
she also suggested she wanted to be involved in a terrorist attack , according to @entity44			0
" i would be making a martyr operation , but @entity325 ( @entity326 , the emir of @entity322 ) said that the sisters so far ( can ) not carry out operations because it will mean a lot of problems for them ... so i can not perform operation			0
... i want to be killed the same way as my husband was ... @entity336 , " she wrote			0
