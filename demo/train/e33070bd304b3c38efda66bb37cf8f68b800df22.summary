@entity1 's decision to file for public status means its no. 2 executive , @entity3 , might be worth as much as $ 1.6 billion			1
according to @entity5 , that would catapult her just below the seemingly untouchable @entity7 in the ranking of the richest self - made women			2
she wo n't have much company : only 7.5 % of the major earners at @entity14 's @entity13 companies are female			1
the many media profiles of @entity3 all seem to be asking the same question : how did @entity3 do it ? how did she get the confidence to perform so well at such a high level ? and perform she has			1
according to the @entity20 , she took @entity1 from 70 million users and no business model to profits reaching $ 1 billion on $ 3.7 billion in revenue in just four years			1
@entity3 's own mentor , @entity26 , ignited a firestorm in 2005 when he wondered publicly whether one reason women were n't achieving at the highest levels in the sciences was a lack of biological aptitude , particularly for math. before long , he was ousted from his position as president of @entity37 -- not officially for this reason -- and the nation was abuzz about women 's lack of parity in so many fields and forums			1
at that time , about 15 % of opinion pieces were written by women , though the imbalance was largely under the radar			1
the opinion page became a particularly contentious space for an outpouring of women 's voices in this overdue conversation			1
nationally syndicated columnist @entity55 called the @entity57 ' leadership out for sexism on its opinion pages			0
@entity60 of the @entity61 argued with @entity55 and said she resented being called a " female " journalist			0
and @entity63 of the @entity20 , echoing one of the most commonly held beliefs about why women do n't have parity , wrote that women were n't fairly represented because they are afraid of being attacked and care too much about what others think			0
but what does that really mean ? the notion that women lack confidence implies a negative judgment			1
it 's viewed as a weakness , coded as feminine			0
but some recent social science research reveals a more likely and complex explanation : people do things because people who look and talk like them or share the same background do those things			0
to assume that a lack of confidence is the reason so few women are intellectual leaders is too simplistic			1
when a woman does n't go for a big corporate job like @entity3 's or says no when television producers call , saying she does n't have any confidence implies it 's an individual choice made in some sort of sociocultural vacuum			1
as women , in many cases , the impulse to do something out of the norm of our peer group , like write an opinion piece or ask for a promotion , has simply never occurred to us			2
if it does , we do n't act on it			0
our girlfriends are n't doing it			0
our female colleagues are n't doing it			0
why should we ? peer influence , whether you 're a teenage girl trying to figure out what to wear to junior high on monday morning or a midlevel manager at @entity117 , is a powerful indicator of what you think is possible for yourself			2
in " @entity121 : how @entity129 , " @entity130 writes , " the social norms set by our peers dominate our choices about what we value and what we expect in life			0
" @entity3 , who often urges women to " lean into " their careers , must know that you do n't lean in alone			1
she runs a monthly salon for women out of her home , inviting guest speakers like feminist @entity137 and trailblazing sen. @entity138			0
women of various generations gather and shape their ambitions over a meal and some conversation			0
at @entity144 , we cultivate new voices , training minorities and women to inhabit their place as narrators of the world			2
the challenge is to shift the way we think about ourselves			0
we must see our peers and ourselves as leaders who have a right and a responsibility to weigh in on the matters of our day			0
we have to create a new ecosystem in which we see ourselves as part of the critical conversations of our age and feel equally entitled and compelled to narrate them			2
who has n't heard a parent quip , " if all of your friends were jumping off of a cliff , would you ? " there 's some profound wisdom in that old clich√© : if your friends are n't aiming for high - profile corporate leadership or going head - to - head on the sunday morning talk shows , you 're not likely to , either			1
we can create more @entity178 by surrounding ourselves with confident , outspoken women			2
join the conversation on @entity1 .			2

writers : @entity1 's @entity3 an *anomaly* ; 7.5 % of @entity13 big earners are female
too often , they write , people *attribute* the *scarcity* of powerful women to a lack of confidence
but people look to their peers ' *behavior* to judge what they 're capable of , writers say
women need to feel entitled to power and must cultivate confident friends , they say
