to any male suitor in the world who could effectively turn his daughter straight			0
overnight , @entity8 's phone was flooded with messages from suitors around the world -- attention she never wanted			1
" there was n't really an opportunity to mope -- ' oh , poor me , i got thrown out of the closet , ' " she says			0
" there were all these factors out of my control			0
i thought , i have to be my own rock			0
" two weeks ago , @entity8 defended her marriage with an open letter to her father , writing , " you have no idea how happy i am with my life			1
" her father dropped the dowry the next day			2
her parents still refuse to welcome her lesbian partner			1
but by coming out , @entity8 has touched off a society - wide conversation about the difficulties facing lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender - identifying @entity42 as they try to find acceptance within their own families			1
" it 's a belief that coming out as gay is a blatant disrespect for your parents , " says @entity8 , speaking about @entity47 culture			1
" but it 's not that way at all			0
most gay people i know respect their parents very much			0
" raised in a strict family , with a tycoon father who made her enter university at 16 and an actress mother who was a " perfectionist " about her daughter 's appearance , @entity8 says she learned from an early age to hold back parts of herself , including her own emotions			1
@entity8 recalls an instance when , as a teenager , she brought her girlfriend to her house			2
" my mom ... cried and screamed and banged her head against a wall and said , ' i will never accept this fact about you , and i 'll never accept it ' til the day i die			0
' so i just sort of sat there in silence , and took it all in , " says @entity8			2
" the best way ... is to be grounded and logical about it -- ground yourself in reason , you have to be a combination of a good actor and a good lawyer at the same time , " says @entity8			2
see who else has been on @entity88 @entity8 says her family 's reaction was somewhat typical of the socially conservative @entity93 society			1
" a lot of what @entity9 is , is family ties and relationships in this tiny , small and overcrowded place , and there 's a lot of people who want to keep it that way , " she says			1
what 's frowned upon , she suggests , are " troublemakers " and " people who rock the boat			0
" but for some young @entity109 , @entity8 is exactly the kind of " troublemaker " they need			2
" when @entity8 came out , it really hit home for me , " says @entity113 ( not her real name ) , a 21 year - old lesbian woman whose parents , like @entity8 's , are well - known @entity9 celebrities			1
" when my parents saw @entity8 , they saw this person who is established , who has a really good career , is still living her life to the fullest -- and that made them realize that i can have that , too			2
" @entity8 definitely showed the lgbt community that there is hope , and we 're moving in the right direction			2
" for @entity113 and many others , @entity8 has become a " symbol " of the city 's growing movement			1
still , @entity8 says life may not be as easy for members of @entity9 's queer community who lack her celebrity status			1
" a lot of people ... come from a life of hardship and inequality , not just because of their orientation but all sectors of life , all facets			0
and to add one more -- their sexual orientation being another disadvantage they have to face , that 's the part that makes it more difficult , and that 's what we want to confront			0
" despite being thrust into the position of role model , @entity8 says she does not claim to be a " leader " or an " activist			1
" " i am who i am , and i speak for myself and myself only , " she says			0
" all that 's happened is i 've been given a voice , and people seem interested in what i have to say			0
