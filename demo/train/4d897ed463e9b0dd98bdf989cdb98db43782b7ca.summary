it 's a gut wrenching quandary we face at @entity3 too often			1
the mission of @entity5 , and our motto , is " change the story			1
" not only do we bring you the latest news on all @entity1 's platforms , but where possible , we provide ways on the network and on @entity1 / impact to get involved and to donate to help those whose stories we tell			1
only , sometimes we ca n't			1
a missing plane , a sinking ferry , a random act of violence -- whether it 's in your state , half way across the country or the other side of the world , these tragedies appear on your phone , at work , in your living room			1
you feel powerless , and so -- frequently -- do we			2
the instinct is to help			2
unfortunately , sometimes effective ways to help are hard to come by			1
it 's often while situations are still developing and @entity1 's coverage is the most in depth that the desire to impact is strongest			2
images of the family members of passengers on @entity43 , sobbing and desperate for news are heart wrenching			2
the families of passengers on the burning ferry pleading for rescuers to work faster , fill us all with sadness , horror and sympathy			1
they make us wonder : " what if it were my child , my mother , my husband ? how can i help ? " frustratingly , it is often when stories are still evolving that the answer -- too frequently -- is that all we can do is wait			0
we do n't know when or whether people will be found , or what medical outcomes will be			0
sometimes , ways to help are part of a bigger picture			1
when schoolgirls are kidnapped by a militant group , it is in the hands of the governments to get them out , and all we can do is wait			0
but to help stop it from ever happening again , we can provide links to connect you with organizations working to overcome barriers to education for girls worldwide			0
we may not be able to stop children from being recruited as soldiers by armed militias , but we can connect you with @entity84 who is working to end the participation of children in armed conflict			0
often we rely on you			0
we do n't always know about how you are working to raise funds , raise awareness , volunteer or get involved			0
but we want to know , so keep us in the loop by tweeting @ cnnimpact			1
sometimes the best way to get involved is to stay informed , aware , ask questions ? imagine if it were your child or parent spouse that was in harms way and ask " could the response be improved ? " at @entity1 , our first jon is to bring you all the facts , provide context and keep everyone involved honest			0
armed with this information , we hope you 'll decide just how you want to impact your world			0
but when tragedies unfold , there will be times when all anyone can do is wait			0

what can we do when there is no way to help ?
a missing plane and a sinking ferry makes us want to try to " do something "
if you know of ways to help , tweet us @ @entity112
