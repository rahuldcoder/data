-- scientists in @entity2 say they have developed an electronic " tongue " that can identify different types of the @entity2 sparkling wine cava -- a task more usually left to the skilled palate of the sommelier			1
using sensor systems and mathematical processes , the electronic tongue can currently distinguish between three types of cava -- brut nature , brut and medium dry -- researchers at the @entity18 say			1
but they hope with proper training , it will soon be able to pick out all types of cava on the market , in the same way a human sommelier might , and quantify how much sugar each contains			1
@entity28 , made in the same way as champagne , varies in sweetness according to the amount of the sugar added in the production process , with seven classifications ranging from @entity35 to sweet			1
the research team in @entity18 believes the electronic tongue could help identify problems during the process and aid quality control -- perhaps reducing the need for human tasters in cava - producing bodegas			1
the scientists have aimed to reproduce human senses by developing biosensors to obtain chemical information and using computerised systems to interpret that data in the way the human brain and nerve system would			1
the electronic tongue is not the first device to challenge the traditional role of the sommelier			2
scientists in @entity58 have in recent years developed an electronic " nose " which can pick up chemical signals to detect different types of wine and where they were made			2
and researchers at the @entity64 in @entity65 said last year that their electronic nose could be used by vineyards to tell the perfect moment to harvest grapes for maximum flavour , or to detect when an opened bottle of wine has gone bad			0
nonetheless , it seems unlikely human sommeliers will be out of a job in fine restaurants any time soon , since their skills tend also to include knowledge of wine regions , service , glasses -- and the all - important wine jargon			0
@entity83 , director of the @entity85 - based sommeliers and the @entity86 , told @entity0 the electronic tongue sounded like a poor rival to human abilities			2
a human being can identify around 10,000 different aromas and scents , @entity83 said , and distinguish acidity and bitterness as well as sweetness -- giving the sommelier a distinct advantage over the device			0
" if it can only determine levels of sweetness and that 's it , i can not imagine it taking over the role of a traditional sommelier any time soon , not least because it probably would n't have the small talk that a sommelier would bring , " he said			0
" sommeliers are not just about wine recommendations and tasting abilities , they are about being personable when a customer comes in the door			0
" @entity0 's @entity113 contributed to this report .			0

scientists say the electronic tongue can tell how much sugar is in a cava
it can pick out three of seven types of cava classifications usually used
sensors and mathematical processes are used to reproduce human senses
researchers in @entity18 say the device could help in the production process
