-- what color underwear did you wear on @entity3 ? your choice may say something about your culture and your hopes for 2012 -- as might whether you decide to ring in the new year by smashing dishes , respectfully bowing to your elders or feasting on everything from cabbage to sticky rice soup to black - eyed peas			1
as they do every december 31 , revelers around the world spent saturday - into - sunday ushering in the new year in distinctive ways			1
one of the most common was by watching fireworks light up the nighttime sky , though this was just one of many ways people found to celebrate and do all they could to ensure that the next 12 months proceed as they wish			1
and yes , underwear is one way to state your intentions -- at least in many @entity26 countries , including @entity27 and @entity28			1
if you wore yellow , that supposedly enhances your chances for abundance and reaping in more money			0
if it was red , then you 'll more likely find love in 2012			0
and if you were sporting white underpants , preferably new and clean , then peace was your top priority for the coming year			0
one new year 's theme that resonates across borders , ages and ethnic groups is feasting on foods in an effort to boost your prospects for the future			1
but the menu varies from place to place			0

people in @entity58 and many @entity60 countries down 12 grapes , one each to " guarantee " a month of happiness			2
in parts of the @entity69 , year - round favorites black - eyed peas , ham and collard greens carry special importance over the @entity72 's holiday			1
people in the nation of @entity75 do n't count on a chef for good luck			2
rather , they rely on the first person to come through their home 's door after midnight -- a person who , theoretically , will bring them fortune for the following year			2
snacking on candy on @entity3 is another way , in the former @entity88 territory , to ensure that 2012 is likewise sweet , and not bitter			0
@entity27 try to optimize their prospects for the coming year by jumping waves or , if they are not near the beach , eating lentil soup or handing out money			0
besides raucously banging together pots and pans , @entity94 eat round fruits to bring good fortune			0
some @entity72 's traditions have nothing to do with luck			1
a front stoop littered with broken plates in @entity105 , for instance , suggests that the person inside has a lot of friends since , each @entity3 , people throw their old dishes at the doors of their friends ' homes			1
the agenda for fun in @entity116 depends on where you are , from partying at a " reveillon " in @entity120 to imbibing @entity122 rum in @entity123 to savoring " beaver tail " -- a @entity116 fried dough treat -- in @entity124			0
still , for all those who partake in grand @entity72 's events , there are many more who make their own traditions			1
it may be a small gathering of family and friends , watching the @entity137 ball drop on tv , or loudly running through the neighborhood			2
some may simply go to sleep early , so they can be energized for an early @entity142 hike -- perhaps while wearing underwear that suits their mood , and wishes , for 2012			2
