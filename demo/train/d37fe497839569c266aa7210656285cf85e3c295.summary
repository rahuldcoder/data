@entity15 , @entity16 : political protests in @entity6 , the aftermath of an attack , and a music megastar who 's using his fame to raise awareness about a disease			1
all of it 's coming up in this wednesday edition of @entity0			1
first up : @entity29 @entity30 : the place : @entity32 the event : an annual address to the nation steeped in history , and the response to it			1
@entity41 president @entity40 and @entity41 representative @entity42 , a @entity43 from @entity44 , both took to the airwaves last night			2
if you wan na watch the complete speeches , @entity49 ! you 'll find ' em in the " in depth " box			1
" now , while we 're on the subject of @entity29 , we are breaking down the history of the speech for you right now			1
" the president shall from time to time give to the @entity62 information of the @entity29 and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient			1
" now , that 's what the @entity67 requires ; there are a lot of things that are traditions that are not required by the @entity67			1
for one , this address does not have to be annual , though a yearly speech dates back to @entity74			2
it does n't need to be in person			2
in fact , our third president , @entity77 , had the speech delivered in writing to @entity62			2
and the @entity29 does n't need to be made at a congressional session of both houses , though that 's what we see every year , and what we saw last night			1
here 's why the @entity29 address is delivered in late january or early february : the 20th amendment			1
it was ratified in 1933 , and it specifies that congressional terms start on january third and presidential terms start on january 20th			2
so , it 's when everyone is seated in office that the speech is given in late january or early february			1
a little history for ya : president @entity97 was the first president to broadcast the speech over the radio ; that was back in 1923			1
his nickname was " @entity97 , " but he was n't silent then ! president @entity102 was the first on tv with the speech in 1947			2
and this is around the time it started being called " @entity29 " instead of the president 's annual message to @entity62 , as it was known before that			1
and in 2002 , president @entity113 became the first president to deliver the speech on the web			2
@entity118 's health @entity30 : the members of @entity121 's congressional delegation were all planning to sit together for last night 's @entity29 address			1
but they were going to leave one chair empty in honor of congresswoman @entity125			2
she was one of the victims of a shooting we told you about earlier this month			2
she 's recovering from her injuries , and she 's getting a lot of support			1
@entity134 , @entity4 , @entity5 : get well soon , ms. @entity125 ! @entity30 : those well wishes came from students in @entity4 , @entity5			1
a lot of people in that community were sending their best wishes and signing " get well soon " cards for the @entity121 representative			2
she was transferred to a hospital in @entity4 late last week			2
doctors say that @entity125 is doing well and showing lots of improvement , but that she has a long road ahead of her			2
@entity149 @entity150 , @entity16 : see if you can i.d. me ! i 'm an @entity153 country that 's home to more than 80 million people			1
my national currency is the pound			0
i border two seas , the @entity160 and the @entity161			0
i 'm @entity6 , and my current president , @entity162 , has been in power since 1981			1
protests in @entity6 @entity30 : after the nearly three decades he 's spent in power , thousands of @entity6 are calling for president @entity162 to step down			1
in the @entity41 , presidents can only serve two terms			0
but in @entity6 , there are no term limits			1
that 's one reason why @entity162 has been president for so long			1
but protests in the @entity153 nation are taking aim at president @entity162 and his government			1
this @entity178 video shows a crowd of protesters moving through the streets in the @entity6 capital of @entity183			1
the people who organized the protests said they 're trying to catch some of the momentum for political change that they saw in the nearby country of @entity190			1
that nation 's longtime leader was recently removed from power			1
during yesterday 's demonstrations in @entity6 , protesters fought with police			1
both sides were throwing rocks and tear - gas canisters at each other			0
other countries , including the @entity41 , said they were keeping a close eye on the situation			0
@entity204 @entity30 : @entity8 president @entity205 says that whoever is behind monday 's suicide bombing at @entity7 's busiest airport will be found and will be punished			1
the attack killed dozens of people , injured more than 150 others			0
and sadly , this bombing is n't an isolated incident			0
over the last decade , trains and planes around @entity7 have been bombed at least four times			0
president @entity205 said that part of the blame for monday 's attack is on the people who were responsible for the airport 's security			1
@entity8 president @entity205 [ @entity225 ] : what happened at @entity227 shows that the airport lacked security			0
it 's unbelievable that such a huge amount of explosives was brought into the terminal			1
those officials responsible for security at @entity227 must be punished for their decisions			0
this is a terror attack , a grief , a tragedy			0
@entity240 @entity30 : president @entity40 called president @entity205 yesterday to offer his condolences about the bombing			0
during that same call , he congratulated the @entity8 president on the progress toward a new @entity247 , or @entity240			0
this would reduce the number of nuclear weapons in both the @entity41 and @entity8			0
presidents @entity205 and @entity40 signed the treaty last april			0
part of @entity8 's parliament approved that treaty yesterday			1
the @entity255 did the same thing last month			0
president @entity40 calls the @entity240 " the most significant arms control agreement in nearly two decades			0
" @entity258 @entity259 , @entity16 : today 's shoutout goes out to mrs. sheets ' @entity262 classes at @entity264 in @entity265 , @entity266 ! what part of the human body produces insulin ? you know what to do ! is it the : a ) liver , b ) kidneys , c ) pancreas or @entity277 ) lungs ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! your pancreas makes insulin , which helps control your body 's blood sugar			1

dr. @entity300 shows us how he 's trying to help other people who are living with diabetes			1
( begin video ) @entity300 , @entity305 : the @entity299 have been one of the most successful young acts for the past several years , having sold millions of records and entertaining audiences all over the globe			0
they just completed a world tour about a month ago , which took them from the @entity41 to @entity312 , @entity313 , @entity314 and the @entity315			0
now , shortly after the group signed their first recording contract , @entity318 , the youngest @entity319 , was diagnosed with @entity320 , or juvenile diabetes			2
@entity318 , @entity299 : i was diagnosed in november of 2005			0

@entity326 : @entity318 was told his blood sugar was over 700			0
a normal level is below 125			0
@entity329 : my commitment to myself when i was on my way to the hospital was that i would not let this slow me down			0
@entity326 : @entity318 has learned to live with his disease and has n't let it get in the way of the @entity299 ' success			0
two and a half years after his diagnosis , on a day when @entity318 says his blood sugar was a little out of control , he wrote a song about having diabetes			2
he says writing " a @entity342 " was therapy for him , and fans have told him it 's helped them cope as well			2
@entity329 : i think just the fact that i can say , look , you 're just like everybody else , you can do what you want to do , and you can do it with diabetes , that 's the best thing in the world			1
@entity326 : @entity319 says he is thankful to be able to do what he loves and uses his fame to educate people about the disease			0
with the @entity357 , @entity318 has been raising awareness and funds for diabetes research for several years now			1
@entity329 : what we can do financially is great and i 'm always happy to do that , but if there is something that i can do personally to inspire or encourage somebody , that means the world			0
( @entity369 ) before we go @entity30 : before we go , during a timeout at a women 's college basketball game , one of the school 's officials was randomly chosen from the audience to try a half - court shot			2

there 's no way this is going to work , right ? @entity382 ! nails it ! he won a set of brand new tires in the process			2
