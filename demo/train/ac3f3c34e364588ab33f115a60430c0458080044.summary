the magazine apologized , saying it respected " local culture and traditions " and claiming the article , which was removed from the site , was an " error of judgment on our part			0
" but the apology was not enough to appease some users , who continued to call for staff at the magazine to be fired			0
@entity85 , an @entity37 @entity86 teacher living in @entity87 , described the article as shocking			2
" have they lost their marbles ? do they not remember that , even though this magazine is targeted for expats , they are living in the @entity37 -- an @entity96 country with very strong @entity4 values and beliefs			2

" she said some of the angry tweets she had seen -- that the journalist should burn in hell , or threatening to assault anyone drinking during the holy month -- were " not in the spirit of @entity6 itself , which is about forgiveness and compassion			2
" @entity85 said while the article may have been pointing out something factual , the linkage of the concept of drinking with @entity6 was offensive			1
