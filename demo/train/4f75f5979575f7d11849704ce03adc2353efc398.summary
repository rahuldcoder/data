-- whether a monochromatic yellow or featuring every color in the @entity4 box , these cites are guaranteed to brighten your day			1
the word " pretty " is n't often associated with the shantytowns of @entity8			2
but gazing across the hills toward the notorious @entity11 favela , you might be pleasantly surprised by the burst of colors , the result of a recent social art project launched by @entity17 design duo @entity16			2
pockets of rainbow - bright residences and streets pop up in cities across the globe ; some are contrived , like @entity16 's favela project and the commissioning of a blue - painted town in southern @entity27 by @entity28 to promote the @entity30 3d movie ( no , really )			1
others , like the eclectic homes and murals of @entity34 so , @entity35 , are more organic , inspired by the creative spirits of the residents that inhabit them			2
from a monochromatic @entity43 city painted pink for a visiting @entity45 prince to the candy - colored waterfront of @entity48 's @entity47 , these landscapes bring a new level of vibrancy to austere deserts , mountains , slums and already sparkling aqua waters			1
@entity55 : @entity57 's most beautiful canal cities @entity58 , @entity43 now this is a royal welcome : @entity60 had the whole city daubed in pink for the arrival of @entity64 , the @entity65 , during a diplomatic visit in 1853			1
the @entity68 capital retains its signature rose - tinted hue across broad boulevards and historic buildings like the @entity73 ( @entity73 )			2
@entity74 , @entity75 a four - hour drive from the bustling city of @entity78 brings you to this village high in the @entity81 , known for its labyrinthine medina bathed entirely in @entity84			2
the area was once a refuge for @entity27 jews who , fleeing the @entity88 in the 1500s , found a harmonious haven in @entity74			1
though most have now migrated to @entity94 , the warren of turquoise alleys remains as their legacy			2
@entity55 : @entity57 's strangest towns @entity98 , @entity99 @entity99 's tourism secretary designated @entity98 , in the @entity102 region , a @entity104 ( magical city ) , and it 's easy to see why			0
the colonial buildings are awash in a vivid yellow that gives the monochromatic town a sunny look whatever the weather			1
take a horse - and - buggy ride around the cobblestone streets past marigold churches , government buildings and the city 's centerpiece : the historic 16th - century @entity117 of @entity118 de @entity119			0
@entity120 , @entity121 no , that 's not a rainbow at the foot of @entity125			0
the pops of color making their way up the slopes are typical of @entity121 's historic @entity131 quarter , where the mosques and homes make up a splashy kaleidoscope of aquamarine , fuchsia and lime			1
its cape @entity139 community is descended from slaves brought over by the @entity17 from @entity142 in the 1600s , and residents began painting their homes to celebrate the end of apartheid			1
@entity55 : @entity57 's strangest bridges @entity149 , @entity150 once @entity150 's old jewish quarter , @entity151 has attracted a more diverse range of residents over time			0
yet the architecture takes you back to a lost era ; it 's easy to spend a few hours wandering , preferably with camera in hand , to capture the dilapidated yellow and pink buildings adorned by billowing red or green curtains , all sparkling against the cerulean sky			1
@entity165 , @entity27 among the iconic @entity166 , @entity165 looks so comically out of place that you 'd be forgiven for wondering if it 's out of a cartoon -- in fact , you 'd be correct			1
until recently , it , too , was a whitewashed village ; in 2011 , @entity173 executives inquired whether the residents would paint their homes blue for a promotional blitz surrounding a @entity30 movie			1
afterward , @entity28 offered to paint the town back , but aware of the skyrocketing tourist numbers that resulted from the gimmick , the 220 citizens voted to keep it blue			1
@entity47 , @entity48 neon lights , frothy facades , quirky patterned lifeguard stands , art deco buildings -- driving along @entity186 in @entity48 is a retro trip back to an era when @entity189 was just bursting onto screens			0
@entity192 pinks and tropical greens flank the white sand on one side , with azure waters on the other			0
@entity8 in 2010 , @entity17 artists @entity16 schemed to turn a favela in @entity8 into a giant canvas for their third project in that city 's slums ( favelapainting.com )			0
enlisting the help of local youths , they converted the homes of @entity208 into a rainbow of staggering proportions , composed of rays in myriad shades radiating across the facades			0
@entity214 , @entity215 legend has it that in the 1800s , when the @entity17 ruled @entity215 , the then - governor attributed the migraines that afflicted him to the powerful @entity222 sun reflecting off the colony 's stark walls			0
the result ? an official decree that commanded residents to paint the structures anything but white			0
today , this @entity229 owes its distinctive pastel shades to one man 's maladies			0
@entity233 , @entity234 these postcard - perfect pastel pink , lemon yellow and sea green facades were hit by devastating floods in 2011			1
while the damage to @entity233 and the four other scenic waterfront villages that make up @entity242 was severe , efforts are under way to restore , rebuild -- and repaint			0
