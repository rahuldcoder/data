-- i would like to think that the horrific killings of @entity4 and @entity5 children in recent days -- and the ongoing escalation between @entity4 and @entity7 over @entity8 -- will force a moment of truth , more rational thinking and real options to resolve the @entity4 - @entity5 conflict			1
there is still not enough pain and prospects of gain to warrant that			0
meanwhile , back on planet earth , @entity4 and @entity5 have entered another yet violent cycle of reaction and counterreaction			1
here are five essential elements to keep in mind as we watch another sequel in this tragic and long - running movie : first , we 're not on the verge of a third intifada			1
true , the situation is raw , tense and full of passion , with a kind of " there will be blood " atmosphere			0
but a sustained uprising or military confrontation on the part of @entity38 and @entity39 along the lines of the first or second intifadas is likely not in the cards			0
the @entity5 public 's priorities are economic and social development			1
unlike @entity48 , @entity47 head @entity46 really has given up the gun			0
and @entity4 - @entity5 security cooperation seems to be holding			1
@entity7 ' motives are more suspect , and it may well have a stake in escalation in the @entity54			0
but @entity7 can not provoke a sustained uprising on its own without broad public support			0
@entity4 's success in breaking the second intifada is still a fresh memory			1
moreover , @entity7 suicide attacks badly undermined the @entity5 image , and @entity5 do n't have much stomach for a return to such tactics			2
second , the conflict has become personalized			2
it 's always been characterized by a perverse intimacy driven by the reality of proximity			0
one way to view it is the old chestnut that the lack of peace is because the @entity4 and @entity5 do n't really know one another			1
the other more cynical and real view also applies : they know one another only too well			0
and they do n't like what they see			0
unlike @entity4 and @entity80 or @entity4 and @entity81 , @entity4 and @entity5 are living on top of one another as occupier and occupied			1
and although the murder of innocents , particularly children , makes today 's situation worse , we 've been through grimmer periods : two intifadas ; two @entity4 - @entity7 confrontations over @entity8 in which civilians died , including children ; and many acts of terror and violence			1
indeed , horrific acts have long characterized @entity4 - @entity5 interaction			1
in 1994 , an @entity4 settler massacred some 30 @entity5 at the @entity100 in @entity101			1
in may 2001 , the bodies of two @entity4 teens were discovered in a cave in the @entity54 -- their skulls crushed with rocks , their killers never found			2
third , @entity8 is exploding ( again )			1
the conflict in @entity8 is real and dangerous			2
we 've also seen this movie before			0
in 2008 and 2012 , we watched sustained confrontations with airstrikes , rockets and artillery between @entity4 and @entity7			2
and the results were predictably the same			0
no clear winner and no clear loser			0
@entity4 has never been willing to invade @entity8 , reoccupy it or supplant the @entity7 government there			1
and @entity7 ' high - trajectory weapons have increased in range , lethality and precision , guaranteeing the organization a certain amount of leverage			0
it 's likely @entity4 does not want to mount a serious ground incursion and is hoping that airstrikes in @entity8 and 40,000 troops mobilizing the border will be enough to get @entity7 to back down and restore calm			1
@entity7 ' end game is n't altogether clear			0
they have posited demands for calm that include the release of prisoners arrested during the @entity4 ' recent sweep of the @entity54 and have called upon @entity80 to open up the @entity140 crossing from @entity8 into @entity80			1
no matter how this latest escalation ends , one thing seems pretty certain			0
it will not end in a definitive solution			0
@entity7 is likely to remain ensconced in @entity8 unless the @entity4 are prepared to uproot it			1
and that will require not only a ground invasion but reoccupation			0
the notion that @entity4 could invade @entity8 , kick out @entity7 and then put @entity149 in charge strains credulity to the breaking point			1
it 's highly unlikely , particularly if an @entity4 invasion led to significant @entity5 civilian casualties , that @entity46 could ride to victory on the back of @entity4 tanks			1
@entity157 , the @entity159 role			2
there 's not a great deal that the @entity159 should or could do at this point			2
with @entity4 in the middle of its @entity165 , a mediation effort has no point			2
the problem is n't between prime minister @entity168 and @entity46 ; it 's between @entity4 and @entity7			2
and the @entity80 and @entity4 have a demonstrated track record in finding ways to calm the situation , assuming @entity7 is interested			2
should the situation get to the point where @entity4 and @entity80 need @entity159 secretary of state @entity176 to intervene , the importance of a @entity159 role might grow			1
but the last thing @entity178 needs right now is @entity176 in @entity4 unable to stop @entity4 airstrikes and @entity7 rockets			2
as for the situation in the wake of the killings of @entity4 and @entity5 teens , it 's hard to imagine what the @entity159 could do			1
what is essential is that both @entity4 and the @entity5 work to calm matters -- and they do n't need @entity159 talking points to grasp how dangerous the situation is for them			1
fifth , what happens when this phase of violence passes ? it 's hopeful to think @entity4 and @entity5 would see that it 's urgent to find a way not only to de-escalate , but to resolve their conflict			1
but this is highly unlikely			0
it would be one thing if this were a two - way conflict between @entity4 and the @entity202			1
but it 's three - way , including @entity7			2
and the faux unity deal reached between @entity7 and @entity46 will not survive			0
@entity7 will remain a spoiler , lacking the power to disrupt a real peace process but always a potential troublemaker			0
but even without @entity7 , the upshot of @entity176 's 10 - month peace process effort reveals just how far apart @entity46 and @entity168 are on the core issues , such as @entity212 , refugees and security			0
and so far , little in the current situation indicates that is likely to force a recalculation			0
not enough pain or prospects of gain outweighs the reality -- however inconvenient -- that @entity46 and @entity168 believe that the risk of changing the status quo is more dangerous than maintaining it			0
the peace process is like rock and roll			0
and i 'm certain that sometime before the end of the administration , @entity176 will make another serious run			0
but unless there 's a fundamental change in @entity4 or @entity5 views , it 's highly likely that @entity178 -- and the parties too -- will remain trapped between a two - state solution that 's just too hard to implement and yet too important to abandon .			1

@entity240 : @entity8 is exploding again ; there is not much the @entity159 can do
what will happen next ? @entity240 says it 's unlikely the situation will change
