@entity0 -- three years after that awful day -- the day a teenager accidentally backed his car over their little girl -- @entity6 and @entity7 have forgiven their young neighbor			1
but they 're having a tougher time coming to grips with the actions of the federal government			1
the source of @entity7 's frustration : the government 's failure to implement a law requiring back - up cameras on new motor vehicles			1
enacted in 2008 , the law had a 2011 deadline			1
it is now two years overdue			1
had the @entity25 acted quicker , @entity7 believes , there is a small chance his daughter would be still alive , and a near certainty many other children would have been saved from so - called " backover " accidents			1
according to the @entity35 @entity25 , more than 200 people are killed and 17,000 injured every year in backover crashes , when drivers back over objects in the blind spot behind them			1
bigger cars and @entity42 , the government says , mean bigger blind spots			1
children under the age of 5 account for 44 % of the fatalities			2
and in a high percentage of those cases , the driver is a parent or family member , compounding the emotional trauma			2
in a nation almost numb to tragedies on its highways , tragedies in its driveways still rattle families and communities			2
for the @entity62 , the unthinkable happened on april 11 , 2010			2
@entity63 , a cheerful girl with whispy blonde hair and deep dimples , was playing in the front yard when she chased a ball into the neighbor 's driveway			1
" she was 2 , had just turned 2 , so she was acting like a 2 - year - old and pitched a fit because she fell down and got hurt , " @entity71 said			1
a teenager , unaware that @entity63 was still behind his car , backed up , striking her			1
at the hospital , @entity7 learned that her daughter was dead			2
" i felt like someone opened a tap on my toes , and all of my life just drained out of me into my feet and a puddle on the floor , " @entity7 says			2
" just this complete numbness and darkness , and it was the most awful thing i could imagine			2
" after the accident , the @entity62 learned that a law had been passed in 2008 -- before @entity63 was even born -- to require the @entity91 to develop rules to prevent back - up accidents			1
@entity91 determined that the only technology available to comply with the mandate would be rear - mounted video cameras , with in - vehicle displays			1
in december of 2010 , @entity91 published a proposed rule and set out to meet a february 2011 deadline for enacting it			1
on - board cameras , @entity91 said at the time , could cut in half deaths and injuries due to backing crashes , at a cost of about $ 159 to $ 203 per vehicle , or about $ 1.9 billion to $ 2.7 billion a year for the nation 's 16.6 million fleet of new vehicles			1
( the price has since fallen , advocates say			2
) but the @entity25 twice extended the deadline , first to december of 2011 , and again to february of 2012 , a deadline it has missed			1
the @entity25 said the extensions were necessary because of the " large volume of public comments and the complexity of some of the issues			2
" asked this week about the status of the rule , the @entity25 declined to give specifics , saying only that the " @entity25 remains committed to improving rearview visibility for the nation 's automobiles			2
the rule remains under review			0
" rep. @entity126 , @entity127 , one of the sponsors of the bill , said she was " mystified " by the @entity25 's delays			0
" they might be doing a cost - benefit analysis worrying about the cost , but i think that is not a sound excuse , " she said			1
" how much is it really going to cost to have a camera , some kind of a camera in a car ... we have bells and whistles of all sorts in our automobiles , certainly this safety should be in all automobiles			0
" consumer advocates blame the auto industry for the delays			0
" after all , you must remember , they ( carmakers ) were against seat belts , they were against airbags , they were against rollover protection technology and other safety measures , " said @entity151 , former @entity91 administrator and chair emeritus of the consumer advocacy group @entity153			0
" it 's time for the auto manufacturers ... and the @entity165 ( which ) is bowing to their wishes , to say , ' we 're going to do the right thing			0
we 're going to protect the children of this nation , " she said			0
in a statement , the auto manufacturers lobby said only that manufacturers increasingly are adding cameras , even in the absence of the rule			1
" rearview camera systems are available on 7 in 10 new vehicles , as either standard equipment or an option , " said @entity177 of the @entity178			0
" this provides consumers with many choices when it comes to what type of safety technology is appropriate for their families			0
" the @entity62 , who now drive a car equipped with a rearview camera , say a rule is still needed			0
and they warn others of dangers right outside their homes			0
" i always told my children not to play in the road			0
everyone is aware that is dangerous ; do n't play in the road , " said @entity7			0
" but it just never occurred to me how dangerous driveways were			0
and kids play in driveways all the time			0
" " five years is a long time for any law , " @entity71 said of the government 's unfinished business , " and for me it 's really unacceptable			1
" said @entity7 , " it is just so painful for us to think that everyone was aware of this problem , everyone was aware that something needed to be done before she ( @entity63 ) was even born			1
and even still , this much later , ( the rule ) is n't out			0
that just is n't acceptable			0
it needs to be out			0
" " we still have a small hole in the center of our family where we are missing a person , " says @entity71			0
" and i really do n't want anybody else to have to go through that			0

more than 200 people are killed , 17,000 injured every year when drivers back over objects
