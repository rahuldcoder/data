-- a year is a very long time on @entity1 -- 687 days			1
@entity3 's @entity2 can attest that it 's enough time for some unexpected life changes			1
on tuesday , the rover celebrated the @entity1 one - year anniversary of its touchdown on august 6 , 2012			1
looking back , some things have gone much better than anticipated , in spite of one nasty snag			0
here 's a look at some of @entity2 's accomplishments so far : signs of life its main mission : find out whether @entity1 could have once hosted life -- small stuff like bacteria , viruses and fungus			1
a key ingredient for this would be signs that there was once water on the bone - dry red planet			0
@entity31 ! @entity32 accomplished right off the bat			2
it was supposed to take longer			0
to find the answer , @entity2 was scheduled to take a hike up the slopes of @entity1 ' @entity38 , a peak nearly as high as @entity41 's @entity40 , @entity3 said			1
but right where the rover landed , it stumbled upon an ancient riverbed			2
not long after that , @entity2 's operators back on @entity41 pulled some dirt from @entity49 's @entity48 , which is the rover 's exploration areal			2
the samples revealed that water once on @entity1 had been the right kind to support life			1
it also found traces of chemicals microbes on @entity41 use			0
" if @entity1 had living organisms , this would have been a good home for them , " @entity3 's @entity60 said in a statement			1
wheels keep turning that success did n't make the challenge of @entity69			0
@entity70 -- which is in the middle of @entity48 -- go away			2
and on the way there , @entity2 hit that snag			0
it suffered wheel damage in late 2013 , slowing down the rover 's already tip - toe pace			1
since it landed nearly 700 days ago , it has driven slightly less than five miles , and its operators are adjusting its itinerary to take it over less rugged terrains			2
even with sensitive feet , like a resolute tourist in a foreign land , the rover is snapping lots of pictures			2
by august last year , it had sent more than 70,000 back to @entity41			2
one of its first was a selfie to show it had made it to @entity1			1
artful hobbler and @entity2 continues to poke around to see what it can find			0
it has fired its laser tens of thousands of times to help scientists analyze varieties of dirt and stone			0
and it has drilled for more signs of the previous existence of water			0
scientists are still assessing the samples in hopes of finding out just how habitable @entity1 once was eons ago , @entity3 said			1
in the meantime , @entity2 has found another similarity to @entity41 in its drill bit , a mineral called orthoclase			0
it belongs to a class of minerals that makes up more than half of our planet 's crust , and the rover pulled up a rich sample on @entity1			1
the rover 's drivers have decided to take it easy on @entity69			0
@entity70 , using cameras on @entity3 's @entity121 to map out a path on its lower slopes			0
but that 's also making the paths longer			0
with its two camera eyes and block - shaped head atop a long shaft that looks like a neck , @entity2 has a somewhat humanized appearance akin to that of @entity132 maybe it 's a sign of things to come			0
during its flight to @entity1 and after its landing , it measured radiation levels			1
@entity138 are using the measurements to determine how much protection would be required to send human astronauts to @entity1			1
scientists create a mini @entity1 on @entity41 curiosity rover takes snapshot of @entity41			1

curiosity has been on @entity1 for one @entity1 year -- 687 days
it discovered right off the bat that @entity1 could have hosted life
the rover broke a wheel late last year but is still hobbling along
it has taken thousands of photos and analyzed *numerous* samples
