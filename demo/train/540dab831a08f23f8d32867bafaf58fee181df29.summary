-- mercedes are preparing for a " true test " in sunday 's @entity3 after @entity4 catapulted the @entity5 to the fastest time in practice , with teammate @entity7 a close second			1
the @entity10 driver , who was raised in @entity11 , set the pace around the city 's tight and twisting streets with a leading lap of one minute 14.769 seconds on thursday			2
" it was a very productive day for us , " said @entity4 , who has taken pole position for @entity1 at the last two races in @entity18 and @entity19 but failed to translate that into podium finishes due to the team 's struggles with tire degradation			1
" it seems that we are quick again on one lap but we 've been working hard again to make improvement to our race pace			2
" it will be interesting to see where we are compared to the others over the weekend as it 's not really representative today			0
" @entity1 arrived in the principality as favorites because the street circuit -- the shortest and slowest on the @entity38 calendar -- plays to the strengths of their 2013 car			2
@entity38 interactive : discover the secrets of @entity3 's circuit qualifying is crucial in @entity3 , where there are few overtaking opportunities , and @entity1 will be seeking to win a fourth successive pole position in saturday 's qualifying			1
@entity49 also took pole in @entity3 last season , in a @entity1 car not vastly different to this season 's charger , which will also give @entity4 and @entity7 confidence that they can repeat his feat. the slower circuit should also be advantageous to @entity1 because it is n't as abrasive on the tires			1
tire wear , especially on the rear , has been the team 's achilles heel this season on race days			2
@entity4 and @entity7 completed 97 laps during thursday 's second practice session in @entity3 -- more than any other team -- in an attempt to test their pace and tire performance during long stints on the circuit			1
" i 'm pleased with what we have achieved here in @entity3 , " said @entity7 , who won in the principality in 2008 on his way to winning the world championship for @entity76			2
" i need to improve my one - lap pace			0
the car is almost there , the pace looks good but we 'll work on those areas which can be improved before the weekend			0
" one - stop strategy there were predictions in @entity3 that some teams might try to stop just once during the race -- which would be a marked contrast to the five - stop strategy the majority of teams had to use last time out in @entity19 because of @entity95 's rapidly degrading tires			1
@entity1 team principal @entity96 agreed there are some important decisions to be made if the team can capitalize on their potential pace and win their first race of 2013			1
" the true test will come on sunday , " he said			0
" it 's a pleasing start but now we have to make the right decisions for saturday and sunday			0
" double world champion @entity106 kept the @entity1 pair in his sights , though his @entity109 was just under half a second slower than @entity4 's leading time			1
the @entity111 took some avoiding action to escape a hairy moment in second practice when he came into @entity116 corner to be confronted with @entity118 's @entity117 on a slower lap. @entity106 , winner of the last race in @entity19 , said he had come to @entity11 with even more motivation to be the first driver this season to triumph in successive races -- and also make a bit of history			1
" i could be the first man to win for three different teams and for sure that is a huge motivation to do it , " said @entity106 , who won in @entity3 for @entity127 in 2006 and @entity76 the following year			1
" of course we want to win the championship , but @entity3 is a special race , let 's say the most important race of the championship			1
" because everyone in the world has heard something about @entity3 , @entity139 and @entity140 , the three races that everyone knows about even if they are not motorsport fans			0
" world champions @entity144 admitted they were still looking for answers after their first run around @entity3 's legendary circuit			1
@entity148 , a two - time @entity3 winner including last year , set the fifth fastest time with triple world champion @entity149 recording the ninth quickest lap. when asked if @entity144 could match the pace of the @entity1 , @entity148 responded : " if we could , we would have done it today			1
" one minute and 14.7 seconds round here is not hanging around but let 's see how things go			0
you will never come to @entity11 and have the perfect day			0
" i think traditionally we 're never too electric here on thursdays			0
" unlucky for @entity158 @entity149 missed time on track in second practice while his @entity144 team worked on his car , which the @entity10 later said had a problem with its @entity165 device -- a kinetic energy recovery system which adds a boost of power			1
" it is not completely ideal but that is friday -- or in this case thursday , " he said , referring to @entity3 traditionally having practice a day earlier than the other races , which gives teams more time to prepare for qualifying			2
" we had a @entity165 problem this afternoon , so i did n't use that			0
the guys know what the problem was with that , " @entity149 added			0
" my run on super-soft tires was very poor , so we need to understand why			0
" @entity158 will need to patch up @entity185 's car ahead of qualifying			0
the @entity188 driver was the only man to fall foul of @entity3 's narrow streets as he crunched the front of his car into the barriers at the @entity195 corner			2
his teammate @entity196 , who is second in the championship four points behind @entity149 , was sixth fastest in practice .			0
