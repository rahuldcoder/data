-- the head of the @entity2 has rejected suggestions that the @entity4 has adopted too soft a stance on climate change negotiations with @entity7			1
protesters march through @entity9 , @entity10 on june 13 to urge more government action on climate change			1
@entity2 chairman @entity13 has told @entity0 that the @entity4 is right to absolve @entity7 from setting firm caps for national cuts in carbon emissions			1
his comments came after @entity4 climate change negotiator @entity18 was quoted in @entity20 as saying , " we do n't expect @entity7 to take a national cap at this stage			1
" " i feel that 's a very pragmatic view , " @entity13 told @entity0			2
" i do n't think you 'd expect any of the emerging markets to take an actual cut or even a commitment to reduce the rate of growth			0
" @entity18 was in @entity7 last week for high - level talks with his counterpart , @entity32 , vice chairman of @entity7 's @entity33 ( @entity33 )			1
in a press briefing on friday , @entity18 described the talks as " very constructive , " and emphasized that the while the @entity4 would n't demand specific cuts in @entity7 's carbon emissions , it expected a " considerable " reduction " to where they would otherwise be			1
" @entity13 told @entity0 that developed countries would be best advised to lead by example and promise specific cuts of their own			2
" it does n't make sense to be tough because , let 's face it , the developed world really has not lived up to what was expected of them			0
i think there 's a far more productive strategy , a constructive approach would be to first make a commitment to reduce emissions in the developed world , get the emerging markets to take some fairly ambitious action within their own territories , and then we move from there onwards			0
" " if you just keep pushing the @entity7 that they 've got to make some kind of a commitment for cuts or reductions in emissions intensity , you 're not going to get anywhere , " he added			0
@entity7 has demanded that developing countries cut their emissions by at least 40 percent from 1990 levels by 2020			0
it also wants rich countries to donate up to one percent of their annual gross domestic product to help poorer countries tackle climate change			2
" i think that 's an opening gambit in a set of negotiations which in all will ultimately be decided by compromise from all those that are involved			0
i do n't think it defines what 's going to happen ultimately , " @entity13 said			2
" @entity7 will be certainly be persuaded to accept something lower , i have no doubt about it , " he added			0
last week , @entity87 became the latest developed country to publicly commit to specific cuts in carbon emissions			0
its vow to reduce emissions by 15 percent on 2005 levels by 2020 was lambasted as lacking ambition , and is a fraction of the cut scientists say is necessary to prevent dangerous climate change			2
" i think that 's not going to be the final word , " @entity13 said of the @entity87 commitment			0
" who knows where the developed world as a whole will end , whether it will be 20 percent or 25 percent or more , but all of this is at least in the realm of possibility given the positive direction that i see coming out of @entity111			1
" two weeks of talks in @entity111 ending last friday brought together delegates from 182 countries to lay the groundwork for a global climate change deal to replace the @entity117 , which expires at the end of 2012			1
it 's one of a series of meetings scheduled in the lead up to the @entity123 in @entity124 on december 7 , seen as the most important climate change talks since the @entity127 deal was adopted in 1997			1
@entity13 told @entity0 the progress made at the latest round of talks in @entity111 bodes well for a global deal in december			1
" i think the whole spirit of the discussion it seems to me as being far more productive than one would have anticipated , particularly given the fact that the @entity4 is now engaged fully in this part of these discussions in an active way , " he said .			0

@entity2 chairman noted " positive direction " of climate change talks in @entity111
delegates met in @entity111 last week to lay groundwork for global climate deal
climate talks in @entity124 in december aim to forge *post-kyoto* *agreement*
@entity13 : " i do n't see what a tougher stance ( with @entity7 ) would do "
