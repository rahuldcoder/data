-- by 2023 , hideously powerful technology companies like the @entity2 will rule the world			1
at least that 's the storyline in " @entity8 , " @entity5 's much - anticipated prequel to " aliens , " which will be released next month			1
" we can create cybernetic individuals who are indistinguishable from us , " @entity9 , the hubristic ceo of the @entity2 , boasts in a teaser for the film			0
" we are the gods now			0
" while the roguish @entity15 might be an invention , @entity5 's imaginary 2023 is no longer pure science fiction			1
even today , big tech companies like @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 mimic " the gods " in their acquisition of vast wealth and power			1
@entity20 , with its 900 million members ( only @entity27 and @entity28 now have more residents ) , is on the brink of a $ 100 - billion stock market launch that will be the largest in history			1
co-founder and ceo @entity33 sees this as just the beginning of his company 's transformation of the world			0
@entity33 , who @entity39 ranked this year as the 9th most powerful person in the world , eventually wants to connect everybody -- all 8 billion human beings -- on the planet			0
and he wants @entity20 to not only become the internet 's operating system but also the platform upon which we do all our digital business			2
@entity19 , meanwhile , has become so powerful that it is now investing many millions of dollars not only in futuristic projects like virtual reality glasses and self - driving cars , but it is also proposing to finance space ships designed to mine nearby asteroids that will supposedly " add trillions of dollars to the global gdp			1
" @entity19 has just got its first license to operate its self - driving cars , but will it need and apply for a similar license to finance the exploration of space in its pursuit of " human progress ? " how long , i wonder , before @entity19 also gets into the lucrative business of building robots ( or " cybernetic individuals , " in the parlance of @entity15 ) which , one @entity68 utopian believes , should take all of our jobs in the future			2
then there is @entity21 , the world 's most valuable company , whose products are already beginning to be manufactured in @entity78 's @entity28 factories by intelligent robots			2
late last month , @entity21 's stock " soared " 10 % after the @entity68 company announcing a record quarter in which it sold 35.1 million iphones and earned an astonishing $ 39.2 billion in revenue			2
with its massive reserves of capital , @entity21 's value is now greater than the gdp of @entity89			1
but even though it has amassed the power and influence of a mid-sized economy and could , if it wished , singlehandedly fix the @entity96 financial crisis , @entity21 , like @entity9 , seems to have forsaken its social obligations			1
and so the disturbing vision of life in 2023 portrayed in " @entity8 " might not be quite as fictional as we would like			2
while @entity21 , @entity19 and @entity20 might be evolving into the @entity2 in terms of their godly wealth and power , these companies are n't returning much of their fortune back to society			1
@entity19 , for example , could soon be the subject of @entity109 and @entity111 anti-trust investigations to determine if it is stymieing competition by illegally leveraging the vast power of its technologies and services -- a claim it denies			2
last month , the @entity117 released a disturbing report revealing there was an organized program within to @entity19 to harvest private data such as user emails and passwords			0
@entity20 , meanwhile , has been playing an endless game of cat and mouse with members over its public use of their data			0
with products like " timeline " and " @entity132 , " @entity33 appears determined to erode privacy and package users as data products that add value to his corporation			0
" you have only one identity , " @entity33 once said			0
and , i 'm afraid , the 27 - year - old multi-billionaire wants to own each of our identities so that @entity20 can become the dominant company of our big data age			0
then there is big tech 's not - so - little tax problem			0
taking advantage of industrial - age tax codes , these multinational giants are leveraging the digital realities of today 's global economy to run rings around local tax collectors			0
since may 2010 , the @entity163 reports , the technology companies listed in the @entity158 â € ” a list of 71 leviathans including @entity21 , @entity19 , @entity161 and @entity162 â € ” paid worldwide cash taxes at a rate that , on average , was a third less than companies from other industries			1
@entity21 insists it pays substantial taxes , but in a world still mostly deeply mired in recession , fiscal crisis and high unemployment , its sophisticated accounting practices are , to say the least , troubling			0
read @entity21 's response on its tax practices here " even among tech companies , @entity21 's rates are low , " the @entity163 notes in an article that spotlights the company 's strategy of sidestepping some taxes			1
from setting up central offices in low tax havens such as @entity184 , @entity185 and the @entity186 , to its use of a complex tax structure known as " @entity189 , " @entity21 has relentlessly exploited legal tax loopholes			0
while i ca n't exactly tell you how the movie " @entity8 " ends , i can confidently predict an unhappy real world ending if companies like @entity20 , @entity19 and @entity21 continue to amass such unnatural power and wealth			1
harvesting asteroids , creating a radically transparent virtual world state and replacing workers with intelligent robots are all very well , but unless our big tech companies recognize their social responsibilities , i fear that our real future could be as disturbing as the science fictional one presented in @entity5 's blockbuster			1
â € ¢ follow @ ajkeen on @entity209 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity212			0

tech giants such as @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 *increasingly* *resemble* fictional @entity2 depicted in @entity5 's " @entity8 , " says @entity212
@entity212 : while their value exceeds the gdp of medium - sized countries , these companies *display* scant social concern
@entity212 predicts an " unhappy ending " if firms like @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 " continue to amass such unnatural power and wealth . "
