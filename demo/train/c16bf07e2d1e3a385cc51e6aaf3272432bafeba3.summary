-- if you told me eight years ago i 'd end up writing an article extolling the virtues of @entity5 , i would have laughed			1
i moved to the @entity5 in 2004 reluctantly			1
i had a great job offer for a newly minted position as the supervising producer of @entity0 's @entity9			1
there was just one problem : it was in @entity13 forward to 2012 , and i proudly call @entity5 home			1
but the road to loving my city certainly had its potholes and traffic jams			1
a sage @entity5 resident offered some excellent advice that 's useful for anyone contemplating a move : do n't come to a conclusion about a place before you 've lived there at least a year			1
so i suspended judgment and decided to look at the city with fresh eyes			1
here 's what i saw : in @entity32 , you can view snow - capped mountains from a warm sandy beach			1
you can surf and ski or snowboard in the very same day , should you choose			2
our city is defined and criticized for its car culture , but we have access to the most amazing surfing , biking and hiking trails in the @entity44 and beyond			2
deserts , old growth forests and lakes are all within easy reach			2
when people come to visit , i drop the top on my old convertible and take them up the @entity52 into @entity53 , through @entity54 down the 101 ( immortalized in the @entity56 song " @entity57 " ) into " @entity58 " and then on to @entity59 , where the winding road along a ridgeline provides breathtaking views			2
it 's a trip that offers visitors an immediate snapshot and understanding that @entity5 is not a flat , squalid concrete jungle			1
it has curves , sexy curves			2
photos : the glamour of @entity5 our incredible natural resources are only enhanced by our weather			1
the year - round warm temperatures draw visitors from around the world to our miles of golden , sandy beaches			0
southern californians love their bikes , motorized or otherwise			0
readers of a certain age will remember the opening from the ' 70s sitcom " @entity92 , " where roommates @entity85 , @entity87 and @entity88 ride their bikes down a pathway on the beach in @entity91			0
i live 10 blocks from that very same bike path and love riding my beach cruiser to @entity97 for an icy cold beer at the @entity99 © with good friends			0
@entity5 is criticized for not having a defined city center , but i 'd counter with the assertion that our many different " centers " are a positive			1
each neighborhood has a distinctive flavor and appeal			0
the @entity108 offers homes with little street appeal and amazing views			0
there 's the always - posh @entity113 , and @entity114 and @entity115 are hipster heaven , albeit hipsters with bank accounts			2
@entity119 seems to have its share of agents , psychiatrists and tv producer types			0
the beach vibe is like most coastal communities , relaxed and low - key			0
@entity128 is packed with students , and driving down @entity130 through @entity131 , you 're hard - pressed to find a sign in @entity133			0
on the edge of @entity108 , @entity135 and @entity136 merge and intertwine ; the written languages , to my untrained eye , look similar			0
i shop in the @entity141 and @entity135 markets tucked away behind dazzling gold statues , and get the most amazing hummus and sujuk from an @entity146 restaurant with the worst lighting			0
speaking of food , @entity5 ' ethnically diverse population offers an incredible array of restaurants and eating experiences			1
you can get great bbq in @entity131 , fabulous banh mi from a food truck , a steamy pupusa from a number of tiny strip mall restaurants , and homemade tamales from the guy who rolls his cooler down the street every sunday morning yelling " tamales , tamales here			0
" local food critic @entity165 built his career chronicling @entity5 's diverse cuisine ; he was the first food writer to win a @entity168 for criticism			1
on sundays , the @entity170 takes over two streets and four blocks			0
it 's a great way to spend a morning strolling between stalls , choosing from produce that was picked just days before at the height of ripeness			2
i once heard an @entity178 extolling the virtues of basil from a particular herb stand			0
i turned and realized it was the late @entity183 , with @entity184 , their new baby @entity185 and @entity188			0
the very produce we ship across the nation is at our fingertips , and you can taste the difference			0
not only are the vegetables lush , so is the vegetation			0
outside my kitchen window is a @entity198			0
most people see them in flower arrangements , but here it 's the size of a small palm tree			2
bougainvillea blooms year round , palm trees are everywhere dotting the skyline like enormous chrysanthemums and ficus trees reach the size of old growth oaks , reminding you that @entity32 is a very hospitable place to grow and bloom on many levels			0
photos : @entity108 and beyond if you happen to like sports , we have the @entity219 , and while the team has had its woes , my co-worker @entity222 ( an @entity5 native ) reminds that " they play in a real league without the designated hitter			1
" speaking of baseball , @entity0 reporter @entity227 loves the fact that the @entity230 , the @entity232 manager of the @entity233 , @entity234 and @entity219 , called @entity236 home			1
some will cite our lack of a football team , but if you 're comparing us to @entity239 , just remember that the @entity240 and the @entity241 both play in @entity243			1
oh , and let 's not forget the @entity245 , designated the most valuable @entity247 franchise by @entity248			2
their 16 championships , five of which came in this millennium , do n't hurt either			0
when people judge @entity5 , many criticize it for being plastic and fake			1
if you just scratch the surface of the city that might be all you see , but do n't forget @entity5 is home to an enormously creative population			1
much of your entertainment is generated here			0
the musicians , artists , writers , producers , photographers and directors who call @entity5 home also imbue the city with an incredible energy			1
it 's palpable in our bars , restaurants and on our streets			2
it 's infectious ; we clap during credits at the end of movies because we know how much work goes into making that two - hour film and we applaud the effort			2
in @entity5 , we know hard work , we know how to meet the deadline and we know how to get the job done			1
the difference here is that we just do n't stress the journey			0
it may have a few potholes and traffic jams , but it also comes with a double helping of sun , sand , surf and smiles			0
the @entity5 is a heavenly place , and even though it 's not for everybody , we 're sort of happy to keep it that way			1
