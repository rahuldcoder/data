-- i 'm not an auto mechanic , i 'm an @entity3 wife , a mother and -- when time permits -- a journalist			1
so when my car needs work , i take it to someone with oil on his hands and years of experience looking under hoods			1
the same is true for plumbing problems , legal issues and medical care			1
i do n't assume that i know better than the experts			1
when necessary , i get a second opinion but , ultimately , i always yield to the advice of those who know more than me			2
with that in mind , i am thrilled that president @entity23 has decided to listen to his experts -- the military commanders and strategists -- and is committing more troops to @entity27			1
but as an @entity3 wife at @entity31 whose husband has already done three tours of duty in @entity27 , i ca n't help but close my eyes , grit my teeth and brace myself for the hard days ahead			1
as happy as i am that the president has finally made a move after months of deliberating , i know that this announcement is likely bad news for me			2
deployments are awful -- just awful			1
there is no bright side and no silver lining			1
for most of us in the military community the luster of sacrificing for our country wore off a deployment or two ago and we are now coasting on the fumes of commitment and shared sacrifice			2
many of us who are married to the military are n't even sure why we are willing to endure yet another deployment			2
our spouses see the fight firsthand and are reminded daily of why this battle must be won			2
they get pep talks at work and enjoy the camaraderie of their fellow soldiers			2
we at home just hear the gripes of war - weary @entity65 and see the news reports of waning support			2
we do n't experience the victories , we only see our children developing emotional problems , our marriages falling apart , our careers sidelined , our dependence on antidepressants climbing , even our houses crumbling from years of neglected repairs			2
that 's why a troop surge in @entity27 brings mixed feelings			0
more troops there means more casualties -- a word i do n't take lightly			1
casualties are people , people with names and faces that i know			0
i see their wheelchairs at my kids ' schools and i 've dropped flowers on their freshly dug graves			0
a troop surge may mean that even more of my friends will be widows and more of their children will be fatherless			0
it certainly means more @entity101 teams in my community will be missing a coach , more families here will know each other only on @entity107 and more pets will be abandoned			0
it may very well mean that i will spend more years being both mother and father , and that i 'll have more conversations with my children about why their daddy is always gone when so many daddies never leave			0
these are not things to celebrate			0
but right now , after just hearing our president give an inspiring speech , i 'm going to consider that this plan may mean that my friends who are in @entity27 now will finally have what they need to stay safe			1
maybe it will mean that if and when my husband has to go back there , he will be in a better and safer situation			0
and , more than anything else , maybe it will mean that our nation will succeed in @entity27 and that all of these years that my husband and i have lost together , all of these friends we 've buried , all of these injuries he and others have nursed -- will have been worth it			0
i am not a strategist			0
i do not know what will take us to victory in @entity27			0
i can not say if sending 30,000 more troops is the right or the wrong decision			1
all i know is that the president consulted the experts and then he sought second , third , fourth -- and who knows how many more -- opinions , and this is the solution he has reached			1
i commend him for making a definitive plan			0
i will pray for his wisdom and for the strength and safety of the troops who will be going into harm 's way , just as i pray for those who are already there			1
i will also pray for all the families back home who are about to send their soldier or @entity161 into the fight			0
@entity163 is a battle i know			0
for many of them , their war is just starting			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity171 .			1

@entity171 glad @entity23 listened to experts , knows days ahead may be hard for other @entity3 wives
@entity171 : " there is no bright side and no silver lining " to deployments
@entity3 wife hopes deployments will mean troops will get what they need to stay safe
