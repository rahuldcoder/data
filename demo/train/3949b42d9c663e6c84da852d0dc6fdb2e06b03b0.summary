, it 's round 2 for @entity5 and the @entity6 in this women 's hockey tournament and women 's halfpipe ski makes its debut without one of its pioneers			1
figure skating with expectations nearly as high as the men 's hockey team , two @entity16 figure skaters are in position to medal thursday			1
but instead of @entity23 being the @entity16 in the top 3 after the short program , it was @entity26 who was just behind @entity28 , the current queen of the ice			1
a few @entity6 journalists thought @entity26 was the recipient of some generous scores from the judges , but she said she deserved the 74.64 total			1
" i 'm very happy the first ( technical element score of 39.09 ) mark was so high , " she said			2
" i skated really well , and i got good levels on everything so i think they reflected my skate			2
" @entity23 fell on a triple flip but still sits in fifth position between @entity42 and @entity43			2
" i do n't know what happened			0
my preparation was all fine			0
i did n't feel too much pressure , " she said despite the immense hopes of her countrymen			0
" the marks were n't as low as i expected			0
i can still fight for a medal tomorrow			0
" @entity28 still looks the part of champion despite her absence from many recent competitions			0
she 'll be the final skater of the free skate , which she said will bring " extra pressure			1
" @entity26 , meanwhile , is the third skater of the final group			1
third - place @entity59 of @entity61 is just before the @entity16			0
@entity28 , who is trying to join @entity62 and @entity63 as the only back - to - back female gold medalists in the sport , claims she is not about being a part of history			2
" personally , it 's not my ambition to defend my gold medal			2
it 's meaningful , but not significant , " she said			2
" i did well today but nobody knows what will happen tomorrow			0
" other notable fact : only four times has a female skater won the gold on her home ice			1
this will be the 24th version of the event			0
women 's ice hockey it 's been a long wait			1
for some , since @entity86			0
for others , since they were children			0
after winning the first hockey tournament in 1998 , the @entity6 women have had to look up to the top of the @entity92 podium to see another team get the gold medal			1
it 's been @entity5 every dang time			1
in 2010 , the @entity6 lost 2 - 0 in the final			1
about half of those @entity6 players are back			1
" there are 11 of us who have been training since @entity86 who came up short , " @entity99 said			0
" it 's something that 's motivated us for the last four years			2
it 's something that really sticks with us			2
" three @entity5 players have won three gold medals , including @entity107 , perhaps the greatest women 's player of all - time			1
" it 's where we wanted to be , " @entity107 , 35 , told @entity109 on monday			2
" we 're ready for this , and we had a great run - up to this game ( a semifinal win over pesky @entity117 )			2
but we know we 're going to have to bring our best game ( against the @entity119 )			0
" @entity5 has n't lost an @entity92 game since february 17 , 1998			1
for the @entity6 the @entity121 have brought bronze , silver , then another silver at @entity86			1
@entity6 players still sting from that loss , but winning gold has been a long - time goal			1
" it 's not just about @entity86 , " @entity129 said			2
" some of us have dreamed of this since we were little kids			0
" @entity5 won 3 - 2 when the two teams met in group play			1
the two teams meet again at noon et. women 's curling the @entity92 world officially was introduced to curling in 1998			1
that year , a magnificent skip from @entity5 led her team to a gold medal			1
she was @entity142 -- schmirler the @entity143 -- and for some of us , the first great curler we ever watched			0
and just two years later , she died of cancer , leaving us feeling robbed			0
@entity5 has n't won women 's curling since @entity149 , but that might change thursday when the undefeated @entity5 face @entity151 -- a team they beat 9 - 3 nine days ago -- in the final			1
" all i can ask is that we put it all on the ice , and we have a shot at the win , " @entity5 skip @entity154 said after beating @entity158 in the semifinal			1
@entity151 has won the past two gold medals but has a different skip this time			0
@entity162 has yet to win any big tournaments and has four second - place results from the world championships			0
women 's halfpipe ski if it 's a new discipline with a history rooted at the @entity121 then the @entity6 will have strong medal contenders , right ? in this case , it 's @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175			1
@entity176 of @entity5 , who is dedicating her games to the late @entity178 ( a @entity5 pipe star who died in 2012 during training ) , has responded well to knee surgeries			1
she placed second at a recent x games event won by @entity182			0
according to @entity186 , @entity184 's husband and her parents made the trip to @entity188 to see the @entity92 premiere of the event @entity178 campaigned so much for			1
@entity176 carries a piece of @entity184 's jewelry with her			2
" she was extremely competitive , extremely driven , but that never colored her ability to be compassionate and generous with compliments and stuff like that , " @entity176 told @entity186 of the four - time @entity194 champion			0
who else to watch : @entity202 of @entity203 came out of retirement and earlier this year finished third at the @entity121			0
men 's ski cross ok , let 's try to predict a sport in which six different people won seven @entity211 races			2
one in which some " favorite " is going to be knocked out in an elimination race by another competitor			0
usually we tell you about the defending champion , but @entity219 of @entity117 has raced just six @entity211 events since 2010 due to a bad knee			0
so we 'll be watching @entity222 of @entity203 who , besides the really cool name , has a world title			0
@entity225 of the @entity6 owns one of those @entity211 wins			1
and according to his website , he works in the family garage when he is not skiing			0
now there 's somebody @entity6 can get behind			1
who else to watch : it seems like any of the 32 racers in the eight heats has a podium chance .			0

home ice has not always been kind to female figure skaters
the same ol ' women 's hockey final is a *revenge* match for the @entity6
@entity5 tries to finish *perfect* curling run
@entity178 would have been proud to see halfpipe in the @entity92 finally
