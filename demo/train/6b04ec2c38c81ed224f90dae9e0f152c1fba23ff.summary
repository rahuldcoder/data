-- his trial 's over			2
and now it turns out that @entity4 might need the same thing millions of @entity6 are looking for : a job			1
as @entity4 and his legal team mounted their defense , they convinced people across the country to donate hundreds of thousands of dollars to help him			1
living expenses , bodyguards and expert witnesses were costly , they argued on websites set up to raise money in the case			0
so what 's next , now that a jury has acquitted him ? for the 29 - year - old @entity24 man , the financial picture is cloudy			1
critics have already accused @entity4 of profiting from the case			1
will the donations keep pouring in ? will he win a monetary reward in his defamation lawsuit against @entity31 ? could he cash in on his personal story with a book or movie deal ? beyond the legal costs , @entity4 's attorney says the case has come at a high price			1
fear for his safety has made him live off the grid for months			0
" i do n't know how he gets a job where he is out in public , " @entity4 's lawyer @entity45 said , " without having the fear of somebody finding out where he works			1
" expert to @entity4 : pick a new career path before he shot 17 - year - old @entity51 in february 2012 , @entity4 had studied criminal justice			1
he applied to become a police officer in @entity54 in 2009 , but was rejected due to bad credit , according to testimony in his trial			0
even with more money in his bank account , that career path should n't be on the table anymore , an expert told @entity0			0
" that is the absolute worst thing you can do , " said reputation management counselor @entity63			0
" it might be your old passion ; you need to find a new passion			0
and it needs to be helping people in a very different way -- a way that is much more compassionate , not just involving law enforcement			0
" so far , @entity4 's lawyers and family have been tight - lipped about his next steps			1
@entity45 describes his client as a marked man , arguing that his options are limited due to death threats he faces			0
" the first time that he got out of jail , he slept a lot			0
i think he is going to have to take a lot of time to relax , to center himself , to get used to his new reality , which is a free man , exonerated , " brother @entity86 told @entity0 en @entity88 ol on sunday			0
" and he is going to have to take his own steps as he sees fit , whatever brings him the best result			0
" whatever he does , his brother said , it will have to be under the radar			0
" as he engages the world , as anyone in his situation would , without restrictions , " @entity86 said , " he 's going to have to learn to move about in a very low - profile way and keep to himself			1
" race perhaps simplest disagreement in @entity4 post-trial interviews donations fueled defense , led to wife 's arrest but online , at least , being low - profile has n't exactly been @entity4 's style			1
through websites set up for his defense , he raked in hundreds of thousands of dollars			1
one site , gzdefensefund.com , raised more than $ 330,000 in just over a year , according to a spokesman for @entity4 's lawyer			1
that 's in addition to about $ 200,000 @entity4 raised on his own through a @entity121 account before @entity45 took the case			1
where did that money go ? a summary on the website gives examples of how @entity4 spent some of the donations : $ 95,000 for bail bond , about $ 56,000 for security and a whopping $ 61,747.54 for living expenses over an eight - month period			2
" if $ 61,747.54 sounds like a lot of money for living expenses for 8 months -- you are right , " the website says			0
" it 's more than most people earn in a year			0
most of @entity4 's living expenses for the first several months were allocated to providing a safe , secure place for @entity4 and his wife , @entity144 , to live			1
" at one point after his arrest , the site says , @entity4 was hiding out in a location that was so remote that it cost $ 2,500 to connect a phone line			2
raising hundreds of thousands of dollars from supporters for your case is a good thing , right ? well , it was n't for @entity156 , who now faces a perjury charge			1
prosecutors allege she lied when she told a @entity24 judge during a bail hearing for her husband in april 2012 that the family was indigent			0
in fact , they argue , @entity4 actually had about $ 135,000 at the time			2
she 's pleaded not guilty , and has a court date in the case scheduled for next month			0
even if donations keep pouring in , @entity4 should n't necessarily take all the money he 's offered , said @entity169 , a crisis public relations manager			1
" he 's got to be careful to avoid the appearances of creating more divisions by accepting money or support openly from groups that , maybe , that would create more friction because of the tenor of this case , " he said			0
" he 's got to be careful about who he associates with afterwards , even if they are offering financial support			2
" despite outrage , federal charges uncertain in case what about a book ? a juror in the high - profile case has already inked a deal with an agent for a possible book			0
could a book or a made - for - tv movie be in @entity4 's future ? last week @entity195 's @entity194 said a multimillion - dollar book for @entity4 would probably be in the offing			1
and that possibility is already drawing sharp criticism			0
in an editorial titled " @entity4 's acquittal should n't lead to riches , " the @entity200 argued monday that @entity4 is " likely to be offered millions through lucrative book and movie deals			1
" " it would be a shame , " the newspaper said , " if the unnecessary death of 17 - year - old @entity51 produced more paydays for the man who fatally shot the unarmed black teenager in the heart during a scuffle			2
" civil lawsuits surge to the forefront even with the criminal trial over , @entity4 still is likely to face several legal battles			2
activists are pushing for the federal government to file civil rights charges against him			0
and it 's possible @entity51 's family will file a civil wrongful death case , which could threaten @entity4 's pocketbook			1
they have n't said yet if they will			0
that could be more likely , some analysts say , if it appeared @entity4 was profiting from the case			2
a book or movie deal could make @entity4 more vulnerable to a wrongful death suit , criminal defense attorney @entity232 told @entity237			2
and then there 's another case that @entity4 started , suing @entity240 over edited versions of a 911 call @entity4 made			1
that lawsuit alleges that @entity31 deliberately edited an audio tape of his 911 call to make @entity4 sound racist			2
" because of @entity31 's deceptive and exploitative manipulations , the public wrongly believes that @entity4 ' use ( d ) a racial epithet ' while describing @entity51 during the call to the dispatcher on that fateful night , " the suit says			1
@entity240 has disputed the accusations			2
" there was no intent to portray mr. @entity4 unfairly , " the company said last year			2
" we intend to vigorously defend our position in court			0
" the lawsuit says @entity4 is seeking " damages in excess of the jurisdictional limit , " but does n't specify a dollar figure			1
@entity4 's brother says the family is focusing on getting a fresh start			1
but so far , the verdict has n't put a stop to debate over the controversial case			0
and it 's unclear what that could mean for @entity4 's cash flow			1
@entity0 's @entity277 , @entity278 , @entity279 , @entity280 , @entity281 and @entity282 , @entity195 's @entity283 and in @entity285 's @entity284 contributed to this report .			0
