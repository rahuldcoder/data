-- results for @entity3 candidates in the most high - profile 2013 races this year -- a resounding re-election win by gov. @entity7 in @entity8 and losses for @entity11 governor and @entity13 mayor -- stand as a reminder to party leaders that the civil war in their ranks remains a toxic turnoff to voters			1
a pattern has emerged : @entity3 candidates who wade into the hottest ideological fights -- such as the government shutdown or the attempt to defund @entity25 -- enjoy a burst of publicity and cheers from right - wing think tanks , conservative donors and media celebrities			1
but the same rowdy , combative style that delights audiences at tea party rallies tarnishes the party label among independent voters			1
that makes life politically difficult for middle - of - the - road @entity3			1
the pattern was on display in the recent races for governor			0
in @entity11 , the @entity3 candidate , @entity45 , narrowly lost a winnable race in no small part due to his longstanding affiliation with the tea party and with attempts to crack down on immigration and drastically limit the availability of abortions			1
in a showdown against @entity55 -- a former @entity56 chairman with close ties to corporate leaders and ex-president @entity59 -- @entity45 tried to mute or distance himself from past stances on divisive social issues , but the damage was done			0
women , blacks , latinos , young voters and government workers -- the same coalition that twice delivered @entity11 to @entity69 -- were highly motivated to block @entity45 , who closed out the campaign accompanied by tea party heroes such as radio show host @entity73 and sen. @entity75			1
@entity55 , by contrast , toured with @entity59 and used his corporate ties to raise $ 14 million more than @entity45			0
exit polls showed @entity45 lost women , blacks and voters under 44			0
and finally , when totals rolled in from @entity83 -- home to thousands of federal workers who were n't thrilled by the @entity3 - led government shutdown -- @entity55 pulled ahead and won			1
on the same day , @entity3 @entity7 showed how a different path could lead to victory			2
eschewing hard - line stances on the government shutdown or immigration reform , he reached out to @entity8 's independents , who outnumber @entity3 or @entity93 in the @entity8			1
@entity7 , who automatically becomes a @entity3 presidential contender , romped to a victory of historic proportions with a majority of women voters , half the state 's @entity100 voters and 21 % of black voters -- groups that are usually reliable parts of the @entity56 base			1
in the hours before his victory , @entity7 explained to @entity0 's @entity108 why his efforts should be a model for @entity3			1
" i think the party cares more about winning the argument than winning the election , and if you do n't win elections , you ca n't govern , " he said in words that should be plastered on the door of every state @entity3 headquarters			1
the battle between @entity3 factions is deep - seated : sociologist @entity122 tellingly described it as a fight between country - club and sunday school republicans			2
the country clubbers , according to @entity122 , are mainstream party members concerned about business development and low taxes , while the sunday schoolers care passionately about social issues such as abortion			0
the glue that long held the coalition together -- common opposition to abortion and homosexuality -- has weakened in recent years			0
a number of @entity3 -- looking at polling and voter data -- have become supporters of same - sex marriage and abortion rights			2
thoughtful young conservatives such as @entity146 and @entity147 have been pointing out for years that the party 's future requires moderating its thinking on same - sex marriage and abortion to keep the party relevant to young , live - and - let - live libertarian @entity3			2
now a more aggressive response is coming from a @entity3 group , @entity154 , that is running ads attacking ultra-conservatives who keep losing elections -- and backing moderate @entity3 against them			2
" we want our party back , " says the group 's founder , former @entity161 rep. @entity159 of @entity162 , who left the @entity163 after complaining about the polarizing elements in the @entity3			2
it remains unclear who will win the @entity3 civil war ; not everyone has drawn the same conclusions from this week 's elections			1
@entity174 , for example , a nationally respected conservative who runs @entity174 , an activist group , says the problem in @entity11 is that the candidate and party were n't conservative enough			0
" the moderate branch of the @entity3 turned its back on @entity45 , and that hurt him big time , " he told the @entity179			2
" politics is solidifying and mobilizing your base -- and the hell with the middle			0
" that attitude among many national @entity3 -- the hell with the middle -- helped doom the chances of @entity13 mayoral candidate @entity193			1
as the former deputy mayor under @entity195 , @entity193 tried to run a candidacy similar to @entity197 's -- moderate or liberal on social issues while tough on crime and fiscally conservative			0
@entity193 , in fact , opposed the government shutdown and is pro-same - sex marriage and pro-abortion rights			0
but voters never heard that message : at every turn , @entity193 's @entity56 rival , @entity206 , simply associated him with tea party @entity3			1
in one of their final debates , @entity193 turned to @entity206 in exasperation			0
" where i do n't agree with the @entity212 is long and hard , " he said			0
" do not lump me with the national @entity3			0
" the @entity3 civil war , decades in the making , will come to a head in the next 36 months , as we begin the run - up to the next presidential election			0
expect @entity7 and other moderate candidates to point to @entity11 , @entity13 and other losses as missed opportunities -- the price for choosing to win arguments instead of elections			1
and expect the tea party to respond that pursuing politics without principles is no way to lead a country			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity233 .			0

@entity233 : @entity3 results -- win in @entity8 , losses in @entity11 and @entity13 -- *reflect* pattern
he says red - meat candidates draw big far - right cheers but turn off independent voters
he says @entity7 correctly said that @entity3 wants to win argument but then loses race
louis : @entity3 's " to hell with the middle " ideologues may have principles but will lose elections
