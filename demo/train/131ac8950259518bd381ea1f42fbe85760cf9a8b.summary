-- over the past decade the @entity2 world has witnessed a shifting of not only hard power -- which saw the traditional armies of the @entity2 world in @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 consumed in internal turmoil -- but also of what @entity12 professor @entity11 termed " soft power , " which has moved from these countries to the resource rich @entity16			1
long before their formation into modern states , the cities of the @entity16 were recipients of talent , skill and economic aid from the traditional @entity2 nation states that have today fallen into obscurity			1
for centuries the @entity27 , or black drapes of the holy @entity29 in @entity30 were supplied by @entity31 , @entity32 or @entity33 as well as @entity34 who were locked in protocol battles of soft power over the holy city			2
this is of course no longer the case			0
@entity41 -- the @entity2 world economic superpower and fourth largest spender on military -- is the party that sends aid not only to @entity47 and @entity8 but also to most @entity2 states			1
according to the @entity51 , the @entity16 , perhaps none more so than @entity50 , are today amongst the most generous nations with regards to financial aid , contributing more than twice the @entity56 target of 0.7 % of their combined gross national income during the period between 1973 - 2008			1
since the beginning of the @entity2 uprisings , @entity62 to the @entity2 world has significantly spiked			1
@entity8 , for example , has received billions of dollars from the @entity16 since its january 25 , 2011 , uprising			0
the @entity8 ' loss of influence over @entity30 -- which was then under @entity68 rule -- to @entity41 founder @entity69 in 1925 was an irreparable blow to @entity32 's mechanism of religious soft power and a significant advantage to the @entity74			1
perhaps no other city in the world , save for @entity77 , commands as much global soft power as @entity30			1
for decades , media output in the @entity2 world was produced , recorded , filmed and performed in the traditional leading @entity2 states of @entity9 , @entity7 and @entity8 as well as @entity81			1
today a significant portion of television production , recording and filming -- not to mention financing -- takes place in the @entity16 cities of @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91			0
much of this entertainment is produced in the local dialects of @entity8 and @entity7 , but the @entity16 cities can exercise a large degree of influence on material that is locally filmed and financed			2
the @entity16 states are also home to the most watched tv news channels in the @entity2 world , a significant mechanism of soft power in one of the most politically unstable regions			1
between the @entity91 based @entity105 and the @entity41 owned and @entity89 based @entity106 is a media war for the hearts and minds of the @entity2 public			0
the two leading news channels of the @entity2 world are accused of reflecting the versions of events closest to the politics of their funders			1
even so , the soft power reach of these channels with their tens of millions of @entity2 viewers can not be quantified and has become one of the main levers of soft power of the @entity16			1
flourishing tourism while tourism has come to a standstill in @entity81 , @entity8 , @entity7 and @entity9 it has flourished in the @entity16			2
@entity89 with its infrastructure and attractions that were built over the past half - century today attracts more tourists than any other @entity2 state and is the seventh most visited city in the world			0
this year , @entity133 ranked @entity89 's airport , home of @entity136 , as the world 's busiest -- in terms of passenger numbers -- for the 12 months ending march			2
@entity90 , @entity91 , @entity140 and a number of @entity41 cities are undertaking massive airport and other infrastructure projects that will keep tourists pouring in			0
the @entity16 cities have turned themselves into globally recognized brands , while traditional @entity2 cities such as @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity149 have become synonymous with turmoil and unrest			2
the massive multi billion - dollar nation branding exercise that cities like @entity90 , @entity89 and @entity91 have undertaken has turned into a self - fulfilling prophecy			0
world diplomatic , business and media leaders continuously make visits to these cities attracted by their commercial , political and media clout , this in turn attracts others to be based here			0
for instance , today @entity90 is arguably the de facto political hub of the region having witnessed visits by most foreign ministers of regional and global powers			0
while the traditionally culturally rich powers of the @entity2 world continue to face internal turmoil and fail to invest in cultural projects , the @entity16 continue to thrive			1
@entity90 , @entity89 , @entity91 and @entity171 are investing heavily in museums and education , attracting talent from across the @entity2 world and beyond			2
for the second year running , a survey of young @entity2 found that the @entity176 topped their list of preferred countries to live in , followed by the @entity179 , @entity41 and @entity180			0
the @entity176 at 39 % scored almost twice as high as the @entity179 at 21 % -- a significant show of force for a country that is n't even half a century old			0
barely a week goes by in the @entity16 without them witnessing major international events and meetings			0
the @entity16 states have been on a publicity and nation - branding streak			2
from @entity89 's hosting of the @entity51 and @entity193 meetings in 2003 to the @entity194 in 2020 , the city is abuzz with global conferences such as the @entity197 's @entity196 , sporting championships and media , it and business forums			0
@entity180 's hosting of the @entity202 of talks in 2001 to the @entity204 2022 as well as @entity90 's massive @entity206 and @entity207 museums -- which are scheduled to open in the next few years -- will cement these states ' soft power advantages			1
when the @entity211 decided to withdraw from the @entity16 in the 1960s they left behind fledgling nations , weak and exposed to regional states and the political ambitions of neighbors			0
today -- due to their incredible soft power -- it is these @entity16 states that carry influence over the rest of the @entity2 world .			1

@entity2 soft power has shifted to @entity16 nation states , writes @entity226
the @entity51 lists the @entity2 @entity16 as among the most generous aid *donors* , he says
they are also home to the @entity2 world 's most influential news stations , writes @entity226
@entity16 tourism is thriving , he says , and the @entity16 ' influence is growing
