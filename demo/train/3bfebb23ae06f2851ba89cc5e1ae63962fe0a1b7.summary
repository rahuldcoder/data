-- there are many strange jobs in @entity3			1
seat filler at awards show			1
producer on " @entity7 " who blurs all of the naked bodies			1
" here 's another : person in charge of the subtitles for @entity18 's reality sensation " @entity13 " ( wednesdays , 9 p.m. )			1
imagine trying to decipher everything that comes out of the mouths of seven - year - old beauty pageant contestant @entity13 and the rest of her fast - drawling , " @entity23 " - playing family from @entity25 , @entity26			1
we asked @entity28 — the fearless @entity13 exec producer who counts this task as one of her responsibilities — to take us into her strange world of tv transcription			1
why does the executive producer supervise the subtitles ? does she have a special skill set ? not exactly			1
@entity37 was raised in @entity38 , not the @entity39			1
but she did develop a special ear for the family 's peculiar enunciations while working on " @entity44 , " the show on which @entity13 was discovered			1
" most people think of @entity38 accents as having this drawl that 's really slow and deliberate , but with this family it 's the opposite , " says @entity37			1
" they talk incredibly fast and they just skip over consonants and entire syllables			1
i do n't know if it 's the region they are from or just the family			1
" and for some reason , she 's the one on staff who can best decode their language			1
" i do n't know why i have this gift , but i understand them perfectly , and i do n't think they need to be subtitled			1
it astonishes me when people are like , ' what is she saying ? ' i 'm like , ' you ca n't hear that ? it 's perfectly clear to me ! ' " how do the show 's producers decide what to subtitle ( which seems to be pretty much everything ) ? " we have so many subtitles , it 's like we 're making a foreign film in @entity84 , " she declares with some amount of pride			1
occasionally during the notes process , a network executive will ask for an onscreen translation of a hard - to - decipher line			1
but here 's the true test : " if the [ family is ] delivering information you need to follow the story line , we subtitle it , " she explains			1
" sometimes we subtitle things that we do n't understand and put in the noises			1
they 're not even words			1
we take it seriously and make sure we 're phonetically accurate			1
" reality tv 's most appalling shows ( so far ) what goes into the subtitling process ? the subtitles require 15 to 20 staff hours of labor per episode , estimates @entity37			1
they are typed in and checked for accuracy ; as many as ten co-workers might weigh in on a difficult line			2
lip - reading is also key			2
" sometimes , it will come down to looking at the upper teeth meeting the lower lip and you know it 's an f or a b , and that could be a starting point			2
" ( another trick is to isolate a family member 's microphone on high - quality speakers during the audio mix session			2
) the show 's online editor keeps a collection of post-it notes with spellings of the family 's made - up words , such as " smexy " and " s'mage			2
" @entity37 recalls a particularly healthy discussion over how to spell @entity137 's nickname @entity138			2
" normally you would n't have to think of that , " she says			2
" but when we went to subtitle it , it became this big debate			1
because s - u - g - e - y looks like " soogie			2
" it became this thing : ' how do we spell it ? two g 's ? one g ? do we spell it phonetically ? do we spell it with an @entity152 and an @entity153 ? " is n't it condescending to subtitle people speaking @entity84 ? or pumpkin saying " marannaise " instead of " mayonnaise " ? @entity37 insists that 's not the intention			1
" they make up so many interesting words and mispronounce things in pretty genius ways , and i do n't want to correct them			2
especially if it 's a delightful mistake , " she says			2
" also , it tests your eye if what you 're reading does n't match what you 're hearing			2
if we put ' mayonnaise ' as it 's spelled , your brain has a little stutter			2
we try to put little quirks in the subtitles because that 's part of what makes them so charming			2
the way they handle the @entity84 language is so fascinating			2
if ( the family members ) were sensitive about it , that would be different			2
but part of what makes this show magical to me is that this family embraces their flaws			2
find anyone on the planet who knows how to pronounce everything			2
to me , it 's relatable			2
" in addition , she says that viewers may be leaning on the subtitles more than they think			0
" when people say it 's condescending , it 's because they 're reading the subtitles so they understand everything			0
if we showed it without subtitles they 'd be complaining they could n't understand enough			0
so it 's taken for granted			0
we give them the answers			0
" which family member is the toughest to translate ? @entity37 does n't even pause to think before answering			0
" i 'm fluent in june - ese , " she says			1
" that 's the hardest dialect			1
it 's just this rapid fire of syllables			0
she does these amazing combinations of words like ' beautimous			0
' ' @entity224 ' is this kind of onomatopoetic word			0
in early edits of the show , ' vajiggle ' was spelled ' vagiggle ' which looked like ' va - giggle			0
' we had to change it to a j. i was an @entity84 major and i sometimes do n't know if it 's an advantage or a disadvantage			0
" the 15 worst tv spin - offs who 's the runner - up ? @entity137 claims that honor			0
" he has more of a slow drawl -- like most people think of the @entity38 drawl -- but he mumbles so much that you do n't hear a lot of consonants , " she notes			0
" it 's an entirely different challenge			0
" and the easiest ? it 's that voluble little star , @entity13 , a.k.a. @entity13 " she does n't talk as fast as the older girls and her mom , and she also has this very deliberate delivery that she was just born with , and she sells every line that she says , " says @entity37			1
" but she 's young still and she 'll probably be talking really fast by the time she 's a teenager and will be just as difficult as the rest of them			0
" how often is @entity37 stumped while trying to figure out what @entity262 are saying ? only on the rarest of occasions			0
she recalls a line in a season 1 episode that tormented her : " pumpkin was saying , ' why do we have all this toilet paper ? ' and june turned to pumpkin and said , ' to wipe your ... ' something			1
i could not understand for the life of me			0
it sounded like ' tootay ' and i wrote down so many words			0
i wrote ' tube tape , ' ' toot take			0
' i listened to it a thousand times and i finally just put in the subtitle ' tootay			1
' i was making up a word as a placeholder			0
and i actually sent the clip to june and said , ' what are you saying here ? ' and she wrote back , ' yeah , i think i was saying ' tootay			1
' and i was like , ' what is that ? ' , and she said ' i do n't know , i just made it up as a word for her butt			0
' i had spent hours listening and trying to figure out what combination of words would have those syllables that matched this context , and sure enough it was just some word she 'd made up on the spot			0
i think that was a pretty big moment of realizing , ' oh , she makes up words			0
there are going to be times when there is n't an answer			0
' " did the producers ever tell the family to speak more clearly ? a few feeble and futile attempts were made in the beginning			0
" and then we realized what makes them so great and so great for tv is just letting them be themselves , " says @entity37			0
" if they were to become self - conscious about trying to speak differently than they just naturally speak , it would absolutely ruin the magic of the show			0
it 's the same thing with trying to get them to speak one at a time			0
it would be a losing battle			0
it 's so much better to just embrace them for exactly who they are and let them be themselves and subtitle it , so the rest of the world can enjoy them and understand them			1
" any subtitle spoilers for this season ? " we do have a scene coming up in one of our later episodes that could quite possibly break the world record for the most subtitles ever appearing in a short amount of time , " teases @entity37			1
" it 'll break the record for the world 's fastest subtitles			0
there might not be a record that 's ever been established but we 'll break it anyway			0
" has @entity37 ever considered subtitling the family 's pet animals ? " we toyed with the idea of giving the chicken , @entity357 , some thoughts when he clucks , " says @entity37			1
" we were thinking about subtitling what he thought of the family			1
but we decided we were taking too many liberties with @entity357 's inner world ...			0
we thought about [ subtitling ] @entity364 , the baby , and what her thoughts could be			1
but we want this to be a real world			0
what makes the show awesome is that it 's so real			0
it still is my dream to subtitle nugget someday			1
" and what would nugget say ? " ' save me			0
