@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 staff sgt. @entity3 has been sentenced to life in military prison with eligibility for parole in 10 years			1
a military court - martial thursday found @entity3 guilty of murdering three @entity11 civilians , illegally cutting off pieces of their corpses to keep as " souvenirs " and planting weapons to make the men appear as if they were @entity18 fighters killed in legitimate firefights			1
he was reduced in rank to private and ordered to forfeit all pay and benefits			0
whatever sentence @entity3 serves will be reduced by the 547 days he has already spent in prison			1
" he said they were all dirty savages , " prosecutor maj. @entity26 said at @entity3 ' sentencing hearing			2
" he is the savage , not the innocent @entity11 he murdered			0
what kind of savagery does it take to do this ? to cut a finger off a victim and show it to people ? this is a savage being " @entity3 ' attorney , @entity40 , had asked the court for a sentence of life with parole so @entity3 would have the opportunity to be with his now - 3 - year - old son again			1
" he has a long time to reflect on his life , what he has done and what he wants to do in the future , " @entity40 said			2
@entity3 is the highest ranking of five soldiers charged with being part of a rogue " kill squad " that targeted civilians			1
another seven soldiers also were charged with lesser crimes including abusing drugs , keeping " off the books " weapons and intimidating a fellow soldier not to speak out against the platoon 's alleged killings			2
@entity3 had pleaded not guilty			2
a prosecutor described @entity3 as a " recruiting poster " soldier			2
but the tall , clean - cut @entity3 and the " kill squad " he was convicted of leading turned into a public - relations nightmare for the military			2
" sgt. @entity3 had a charisma , he had a ' follow me ' personality , " maj. @entity71 , a prosecutor in the case , told the court in closing arguments wednesday			1
" but it was all a bunch of crap , he had his own mission : murder and depravity			0
" the murders @entity3 is accused of committing took place over a period of five months last year , while @entity3 led the 3rd platoon of the @entity88 5th @entity87 in @entity89 , @entity11			1
@entity91 ' platoon was tasked with patrolling small villages in the area to build relationships with an @entity11 population wary of the @entity97 presence in their country			0
instead , prosecutors said @entity3 and a small group of rogue soldiers allegedly plotted to murder civilians and then planted weapons on them so they appeared to be @entity18 attackers			1
" selling a fake engagement as a real engagement , that 's what they were doing , " @entity71 told the court			0
in court testimony , @entity3 said he did not execute anyone			2
prosecutors said @entity3 participated in the killings of three unarmed civilians : two farmers and a village cleric			1
@entity3 said he killed one of the men , but he claimed it was in self - defense			1
however , the staff sergeant admitted to ripping and cutting off fingers of all three men he was charged with killing			0
he kept the body parts , he said , to give to soldiers he favored or to intimidate soldiers he disliked			0
" i was numb to the situation , " @entity3 told the court about why he had taken the body parts			0
" i was n't thinking ; it 's sickening			0
" @entity3 also admitted to posing for photos with bodies against military regulations			0
" people wanted to prove they were there , " @entity3 replied when asked by his attorney why the soldiers took the photos			0
the @entity4 later apologized after the photos were leaked to the press			0
@entity3 appeared shocked after the verdict was read , and his wife , @entity4 spec. @entity141 , began to cry			0
according to court records , she filed for divorce from staff sgt. @entity3 in august and asked for custody of their toddler son			1
the panel of three officers and two enlisted soldiers started deliberating in a military courtroom near @entity152 shortly before 10 a.m. ( 1 p.m. et ) and returned its verdict around 3 p.m. ( 6 p.m. et )			0
@entity40 , @entity3 ' defense attorney , had argued other soldiers were framing his client			1
three soldiers pleaded guilty to the killings and agreed to testify against @entity3 as part of plea deals			1
" what if there is no hard evidence other than what you have heard from that witness stand ? " @entity40 said wednesday			0
some witnesses also admitted to smoking hashish they obtained from @entity11 translators			0
their testimony , @entity40 said , " came under a cloud of hash			0
" @entity40 argued @entity3 was n't where other witnesses said he was during the engagements			0
and , according to @entity40 , in february 2010 @entity3 could n't have smuggled an @entity175 in his backpack into a village where prosecutors said he then planted the assault rifle on the body of an @entity11 man he had killed			1
grasping an @entity175 , @entity40 showed the rifle would not fully fit into a soldier 's backpack			0
prosecutors countered that @entity3 had used a model of the rifle that has a shorter muzzle and could be concealed			2
@entity3 remains under investigation for the 2004 shooting death of a family in @entity193 during his tour there , @entity4 spokesman maj. @entity189 told @entity2 thursday			1
the investigation into the family 's killing had been closed but was reopened after @entity3 was charged with the murders of civilians in @entity11			1
during testimony last week , @entity3 said he shot at a car that failed to stop at a checkpoint in @entity193 that he was manning			1
inside the bullet - riddled car , @entity3 testified , were not combatants but an unarmed @entity193 family			1
@entity3 admitted in court that he told his troops in @entity11 about the @entity193 shooting as an example that soldiers would not face consequences for acting aggressively , even if civilians were hurt			1
" if they are put in a tight situation , do n't not pull the trigger , " @entity3 said he advised members of his platoon in @entity11			2
" you wo n't go to jail for it			0
