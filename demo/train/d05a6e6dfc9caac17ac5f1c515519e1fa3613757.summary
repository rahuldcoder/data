@entity0 -- @entity2 , the charismatic journalist - turned - politician who surprisingly vaulted to second place in @entity6 's national election , has long been a familiar face across the jewish state			1
the 49 - year - old leader of the centrist @entity11 party is a former journalist and talk show host , son of a prominent politician , and a one - time amateur boxer with a rep as one of @entity6 's sexiest men			1
@entity2 segued his journalism into politics and emerged as an archetype -- a voice of the middle - class @entity6 striving for success , but anxious about the high cost of living , a voice representing @entity6 who 've had it with the exemptions from mandatory military service for the @entity31 , a voice of everyday optimism			1
opinion : split vote offers options to @entity6 leaders he now has the clout to choose between leading the political opposition or becoming the key partner in a @entity43 - led coalition			1
or , the question has been raised , would @entity6 president @entity45 decide to ask @entity2 to form a government ? members of @entity11 range across the spectrum , @entity2 said after the election in @entity50			1
the bloc has attracted @entity52 from the @entity53 , the @entity54 , and @entity55 , the religious and secular , centrists , leftists , and rightists , men and women			0
" what unites all of them is that they said yes for hope and yes for mutual responsibility and yes to the fact that the truth is not being held in any side , " @entity2 said			1
@entity2 emerged in an election that displayed @entity6 's political polarization , between staunch right - wingers focused on security and centrists focused on a better economy and society			1
prime minister @entity43 remains the front runner to be prime minister , with exit polls reporting his rightist @entity82 gaining 31 seats in the 120 - seat @entity84			2
@entity86 's far - right @entity85 pulled in between 11 seats , according to exit polls numbers from the daily newspaper @entity89			1
@entity90 , a religious party , gained 11 seats			0
but the center and the left showed strength			0
@entity2 's party gained at least 19 seats , onetime powerhouse @entity97 , 15 , former foreign minister @entity99 's @entity98 , 6 , and leftwing @entity100 , 6			1
' there is a future ' the @entity103 @entity11 means ' there is a future			1
' the party 's platform is decidedly domestic : reforming government , seeking affordable housing , improving a " failing " education system , and the biggest hot - button issue , putting an end to the exemption from mandatory military service for @entity31 who have traditionally been legally allowed to avoid military service in order pursue religious study			1
there 's much less from @entity2 on how to resolve the @entity6 - @entity121 conflict			1
but in interviews , @entity2 has proposed @entity6 should give up much of the @entity123 -- while retaining control of @entity0			1
the bio on his party 's website details his career			2
he worked as a newspaper correspondent , hosted talk shows , published seven books , including children 's books , thrillers and a memoir in the voice of his father			0
he wrote a tv drama , and acted in a film			0
he 's a family man , married to a woman he met on reserve duty , and has three children			0
@entity144 : @entity6 coalition difficult to predict @entity2 is the son of the late politician @entity146 , whose one - time anti-religious party @entity147 battled the power and influence of the @entity31			1
when @entity2 transitioned into @entity6 politics , he did n't shy away from dealing with @entity31 military exemptions			1
" we will fight for equality in national responsibilities with everyone serving and everyone working , " he said			0
but he used diplomatic language and persuasion in an effort to forge partnerships and policies with religionists			0
that 's a contrast to his father 's combative stance toward the @entity31			0
his party leadership reflects the championing of the diversity he espouses			0
they include the mayors of @entity171 and @entity172 , a former @entity0 police chief , @entity174 , @entity175 , rabbis and a former personal aide to slain prime minister @entity178			0
voices from the center one of the leaders is rabbi @entity182 , a confidant of @entity2 and an @entity184 immigrant to @entity6			1
he represents the @entity31 , @entity11 's website says , @entity31 who want to combine @entity187 study with national / @entity189 service and participation in the workforce			1
in an interview this month before the election , @entity182 said he was drawn to the outreach to the religious community from @entity2 whom he characterizes as " very much a secular icon of sorts			2
" " he was saying it was time to stop focusing on our own sectors and it was time for us to work together , " @entity182 said			0
" that really spoke to me			0
" @entity2 is optimistic , @entity182 said , " that @entity6 society has reached a point where they are saying ' no more ' to the way things have been handled			1
" " one of our slogans is ' the future of @entity6 is in our hands			2
' with leadership there are two steps , the first is to give people the belief that something can happen , and then to execute it , " @entity182 said			0
" i think @entity219 1 he 's really done			0
it 's a breath of fresh air			1
in @entity6 politics , you do n't really hear people talking about vision and where we can be and setting our sights high			2
he 's really doing that			0
i think he on a certain level has instilled that hope			0
i think he 's optimistic because he 's seen the response to his call for making this change and that we can actually get this done			0
" @entity43 dips into centrists ' playbook for @entity6 's new government @entity241 , a noted @entity6 author , wrote an essay wednesday in @entity243 , an online magazine about @entity85 issues			1
the piece is entitled " why i voted for @entity2			2
" " as a centrist @entity6 , " he said , " i have no other political home			2
" @entity43 tried to make @entity82 more of a center - right movement , " but the ideological right within the @entity82 revolted			0
today 's @entity82 appears more hospitable to the far rightist @entity251 than to centrists like @entity253 , denied a safe seat in the @entity82 primaries , " @entity241 wrote			0
in contrast , @entity2 has an " eclecticism " that " reflects his ability -- alone among today 's leaders -- to define the @entity6 center			1
" " he is a secular @entity6 who has shown increasing interest in @entity263			2
he supports a two - state solution and opposes settlement construction outside the large settlement blocs			0
yet he launched his campaign from the @entity123 city of @entity269 , sending the message that settlers are part of @entity6 too			2
he opposes the wholesale draft exemption of @entity31 young men , but he advocates a gradualist approach and has an @entity31 rabbi on his @entity84 list			2
he emerged as the voice of middle class disaffection , yet included in his list two @entity281 , representatives of one of the country 's poorest constituencies			1
" @entity241 says @entity2 is " frankly , unapologetically , in love with the state of @entity6			1
" " there is nothing complicated about @entity290 's @entity289			0
he is not a hyphenated @entity6 , whose loyalty to the state depends on its fulfillment of an ideological agenda			2
@entity290 conveys the impression of a man comfortable in all parts of @entity6 , " @entity241 wrote			2
@entity1 's @entity298 reported from @entity299			0
@entity1 's @entity300 reported from @entity0			0
