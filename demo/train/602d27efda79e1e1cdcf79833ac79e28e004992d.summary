-- as @entity2 understood it , desperate times call for desperate measures			1
and when your @entity7 mountain dog gobbles up your masters tickets , that means getting out the hydrogen peroxide and getting ready to sift through your canine 's vomit			1
that 's the choice the @entity16 resident made after a fit of panic when he realized saturday night that his beloved canine @entity20 had eaten his and his friends ' four passes to the prestigious @entity23 , @entity24 , golf tournament			0
augusta beyond that exclusive golf club " laying on the hardwood floor was just the strings from ( the tickets ) " as he came in from a short trip outside , @entity2 recalled			2
" with just a few hours to go before he boarded his 6 a.m. sunday flight east , he called his girlfriend , who recommended he give @entity20 some low - concentration hydrogen peroxide solution , which many recognize as a safe way to get a dog to vomit			0
thankfully , it was late in the day and @entity20 had n't eaten much recently			0
so when she threw up , the result was " not as bad as you 'd think , " @entity2 said on thursday			1
still , the tickets were far from whole and far from pristine			0
@entity2 was able to cobble together the tickets into something resembling the four passes he 'd received after the annual @entity48 ticket lottery in august			1
so @entity2 took off , holding the stitched together passes close to the vest			0
he also kept from his three buddies the news that his dog had eaten their perhaps once - in - a - lifetime chance to traverse the greens of @entity55			2
the masters by numbers the foursome had been planning the trip for months , and @entity2 said he did n't want to let his friends down ( until , @entity61 forbid , he had no other choice )			1
so after a traveling day on sunday , the friends played golf for 36 holes in @entity66 , @entity67			0
the fact @entity2 kept darting away for surreptitious phone calls was perhaps the only clue that something was awry			2
equipped with what was left of the tickets , pictures of the originals and an e-mail verification of his purchase , he called @entity23 's ticket office on monday morning in hopes they 'd be " gracious @entity82 folks " and let him and his friends attend the event			1
" about 10 minutes later , they called back and asked if i was the one with the hungry dog , " @entity2 told @entity83			2
" and i said , ' indeed i am			0
' " two days later , he and his since - informed friends picked up their reprinted tickets and watched the final practice round for the masters -- an experience @entity2 described as " incredible , " even after inclement weather shortened their stay			1
photos : masters , @entity95 by thursday , he was back home in @entity98 with @entity20 healthy and happy by his side			0
" she 's just fine , " @entity2 said			2
" she 's as happy as can be , and completely oblivious to the fact that she 's famous			1
" @entity83 's @entity103 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 says his dog ate four masters tickets he 'd gotten months *ago*
the dog threw up the tickets , and @entity2 then pieced them together
authorities at @entity55 heard his tale , allowed him to attend event
his dog is " happy *...* and completely oblivious to the fact that she 's famous "
