-- @entity1 of every military branch told a @entity4 committee tuesday they opposed letting prosecutors , rather than commanders , handle sexual assault investigations , as one senator has introduced legislation aimed at doing just that			1
@entity12 chairman @entity11 said there may be public confusion about the military 's reporting process			2
referring to media reports that there is only one way to report sexual assault , the @entity18 @entity17 asked each of the military heads at a hearing if there currently are multiple options in addition to notifying a unit commander			2
they also told the committee that instances of commanders ignoring their judge advocate generals ' advice in sexual assault cases are extremely rare			1
sen. @entity38 , the top @entity39 member of the @entity12 , earlier called sexual assault in the military " an enemy to morale and readiness " and urged his colleagues to tread carefully in tackling the issue			2
@entity38 said he is opposed to any legislation " removing commanders from their indispensable roles " in the military justice system and noted that military and civilian courts are different animals because members of the military do not enjoy the same rights as civilians			1
" there 's a risk of unintended consequences if we act with haste without thorough and thoughtful review , " the @entity57 lawmaker said			2
representatives knock sen. @entity66 ' comments on sexual assault the congressional committee called the unprecedented hearing , which includes testimony from the @entity1 and top military lawyers , after sen. @entity72 , @entity74 - @entity73 , introduced legislation that would remove the chain of command from the process victims go through to get their claims heard			1
gen. @entity80 , chairman of the @entity1 ; gen. @entity81 , chief of staff of the army ; adm. @entity83 , chief of naval operations ; gen. @entity84 , commandant of the @entity85 ; gen. @entity87 , chief of staff of the @entity89 , and adm. @entity90 , commandant of the @entity91 , each acknowledged that sexual assault is a serious problem but one that commanders are equipped to handle			1
they all used their opening statements to the committee to express opposition to @entity72 's proposal			2
" these crimes cut to the heart of the @entity102 's readiness for war			2
they destroy the very fabric of our force -- soldier and unit morale , " @entity81 said			2
but while there may be derelict commanders , he said , those are anomalous , and the chain of command must be " fully engaged and at the center of any solution " to the issue			1
the general later said that it was a misconception that commanders handle complaints independently of the military justice system			1
" you have a very experienced judge advocate by your side the whole time , " he said			2
" they are taught to rely on their judge advocate generals			2
" @entity130 football players investigated in sex assault complaint @entity72 was undaunted , emphasizing that commanders would be removed from the process only for the most serious crimes , such as rape and murder			1
she said she agreed with the military chiefs that " the chain of command is essential for setting the climate , " but there is a difference between setting a tone and dealing with serious crime , especially when one of the compounding factors in reporting sexual assault is a lack of trust			0
" you have lost the trust of the men and women who rely on you , that you will actually bring justice in these cases , " @entity72 said			0
" they 're afraid to report			0
they think their careers will be over			0
" sen. @entity158 , @entity159 , said 90 % of victims who do n't report said they did n't do so out of fear of retaliation or because they were deterred after witnessing the treatment of other victims who reported sexual assaults			1
@entity72 said there are commanders who are not objective , who do n't want women in the military in the first place , who do n't know the difference between a " slap on the ass and rape			1
" sens. @entity174 , @entity177 - @entity176 ; and @entity178 , @entity179 , also previously expressed concerns about the military lumping all sexual assault and sexual harassment cases under the category of unwanted sexual contact , rather than breaking out the more severe crimes of rape , sodomy and assault			1
@entity72 added that the @entity190 should follow the leads of allies like @entity193 , @entity194 and the @entity195 , all of which , she said , have taken the chain of command out of investigations into serious crimes			0
soldiers and sex : can men evolve ? @entity80 replied that he 'd prefer a " constellation of checks and balances " to help empower commanders and hold them accountable			1
@entity84 said he 'd be open to removing the chain of command if he thought it would work , but he had no proof it would			0
a second panel of military commanders , convened after the military chiefs , followed suit with their superiors , saying not only would removing commanders from the investigative process undermine their troops ' trust in them , but it would also deny them the effective tool of nonjudicial punishment , known as @entity223			1
commanders also must be able to decide whether an allegation should be investigated , or the subject of a court - martial , they said			1
" i need to be able to take action against any perpetrator and hold people accountable , " air force col. @entity232 , commander of the @entity233			0
the commanders ' ability to convene a court - martial acts as a deterrent , and @entity85 col. @entity238 , commander of the @entity239 , said he suspected that an " overwhelming " number of @entity85 would take their chances that an independent prosecutor might be more lenient			1
" if you remove my authority to convene a court - martial , the majority of @entity85 will refuse ( nonjudicial punishment ) , " @entity238 said			0
the colonel said he was unaware of any instances in which a chain of command retaliated against a serviceman or servicewoman for reporting sexual assaults , but he said there is " peer pressure against reporting right now , " an attitude that is changing			0
@entity178 said she was disappointed in the commanders ' testimony			1
" it sounds like you all are very bullish on the status quo , " the senator said , calling the status quo " not acceptable			1
" earlier in the hearing , @entity80 said he has seen numerous proposals that have merit			1
among them : prohibiting people convicted of sexual assault from joining the military , administrative discharges for those convicted while serving , requiring commanders to report all claims up to the next commander , and increasing the transparency of commanders ' actions			1
@entity277 : scourge of sexual assault ' must be stamped out ' " our goal should be to make commanders more accountable , " he said			1
pressed by sen. @entity284 , @entity285 , about whether there are sufficient regulations to prevent convicted sexual predators from joining the military , @entity80 said no. presently , there are " inadequate protections for precluding that from happening , so a sex offender could , in fact , find their way into the armed forces of the @entity190 , " @entity80 said			1
@entity284 , a decorated @entity130 veteran and former prisoner of war , said he could not give a mother " unqualified support " if she asked him whether her daughter should join the military			0
@entity84 said that the @entity85 have tackled scourges in the past -- namely , racism after @entity305 and drug use after the @entity307 -- and prevailed			0
discipline and behavior problems must be handled from the top down , he said			0
" a unit will rise or fall as a direct result of the leadership of its commanding officer , " @entity84 said			0
" they should never be forced to delegate their authority			0
" he further said that in 43 years , he could n't think of an incident in which he opposed a judge advocate general 's recommendation to prosecute , but he recalled many incidents in which he had ordered prosecution when the @entity324 advised against it			1
@entity11 appeared to agree with the military chiefs			0
" the chain of command has achieved cultural change before			0
for example , two generations ago when we faced problems with racial dissension in the military , and more recently , with the change to the ' do n't ask do n't tell ' policy , and the chain of command can do it again , " he said			1
@entity72 wants to give military prosecutors -- rather than commanders -- the power to decide whether cases are investigated because , she asserts , the current system opens the victim up to retaliation			1
@entity72 and others feel commanders can not be impartial figures , especially if both the victims and perpetrators are under their command			1
@entity102 suspends general due to allegations of misconduct speaking on a third and final panel of the day , @entity352 , executive director and co-founder of @entity354 , expressed support for @entity72 's legislation , saying it would help stop retaliation			2
" the first thing it 'll do is restore faith and trust in the system			0
right now victims do n't have any of that			2
they 've lost all hope in the military justice system unfortunately , " she said			0
" i have not met a woman in the military yet who has not experienced some form of discrimination or harassment			0
when that is , sort of , the average experience of a woman in the military , a culture of harassment is created , and sexual predators will thrive in that culture			2
" the military has been hit hard over the issue of sexual assault among its ranks , with the @entity387 reporting an estimated 26,000 cases of unwanted sexual contact , ranging from rape to groping , in 2012			2
that was a 35 % jump from 2010 , the @entity387 said			0
the report prompted president @entity393 , during may 24 commencement exercises at the @entity395 , to tell graduates , " those who commit sexual assault are not only committing a crime , they threaten the trust and discipline that makes our military strong			0
" a handful of recent high - profile incidents have brought this issue to the forefront : -- an @entity102 sergeant first class assigned to the sexual assault prevention unit at @entity409 , @entity410 , is being investigated for alleged sexual assault , pandering , abusive sexual contact and maltreatment of subordinates			0
-- in early may , an @entity89 officer who worked with an assault prevention unit was charged with sexual battery after being accused of grabbing a woman and groping her buttocks and breasts in a parking lot not far from his @entity423 office			0
-- three @entity190 @entity395 football players are under investigation in an alleged sex assault involving a female midshipman at an off - campus " football house " party in april 2012 , according to a @entity387 official			0
the victim says she learned from friends and social media that the players claimed to have had sexual intercourse with her while she was intoxicated , her lawyer said			0
@entity393 : @entity387 leaders ' ashamed ' over sexual assaults plaguing military			0

" it sounds like you all are very bullish on the status quo , " senator tells commanders
senator : some commanders ca n't differentiate between " slap on the ass and rape "
gen. @entity80 : " inadequate protections " to keep predators out of armed services
legislation would allow prosecutors , not commanders , to decide if claims have merit
