in its roster : @entity4 launched to an estimated $ 94 million this weekend in 4,080 theaters , setting a new record for an august debut			1
( the previous winner was 2007 's @entity9 , with $ 69.3 million			1
) that 's the third biggest opening of 2014 so far , behind @entity11 : age of extinction ( $ 100 million ) and @entity1 's @entity13 : the winter soldier ( $ 95 million )			1
it 's also the seventh best opening in history for a non-sequel ( or sixth if you count @entity19 as a mega-sequel ) , outpacing other superhero series debuts such as 2011 's @entity22 ( $ 65.7 million ) and 2011 's @entity13 : the @entity23 ( $ 65.1 million )			2
one more fun stat : guardians is @entity1 's ninth ( ! ) consecutive no. 1 movie , a streak that reaches back to ghost rider : spirit of @entity31 ( 2012 ) , which debuted at no. 3			2
guardians was a $ 170 million gamble for @entity1 that featured unfamiliar characters and an untested lead actor , @entity35 and @entity37 favorite @entity36 , who stars with @entity38 , @entity39 , and the voices of @entity41 and @entity42			2
but a marketing campaign that highlighted the movie 's outer - space action and sarcastic , @entity47 tone ( not to mention @entity36 's newly sculpted physique ) drew early buzz , and the movie 's release brought a wave of critical praise : guardians scored a great 92 percent from reviewers on @entity56 and an a- from @entity0 's @entity58 , who called it " a giddily subversive space opera that runs on self - aware smart - assery			2
" with an @entity63 , the @entity62 adventure looks likely to perform well in the coming weeks — and @entity1 recently announced that a sequel is already in the works			2
the movie also earned $ 66.4 million overseas , bringing its global gross to a stellar $ 160.4 million			0
the weekend 's other new wide release , the @entity71 biopic @entity69 , earned an estimated $ 14 million , coming in at third place			1
directed by @entity74 ( the help ) and starring @entity76 ( 42 ) , the musical drama reportedly cost $ 30 million and received generally favorable reviews from critics , though @entity0 's @entity58 noted that it plays too " safe " for a biopic about the @entity71			0
with an @entity63 , the movie could have legs			0
the film may also be opening too early to get the big - time awards attention that helped past music biopics like @entity85 , which opened to $ 20 million on its way to $ 75.3 million in 2004 , or the genre 's all - time champ , 2005 's @entity90 , which bowed to $ 22.3 million and ultimately grossed $ 119.5 million			0
@entity69 did n't have the box office moves to unseat @entity93 in the no. 2 spot			1
the @entity96 action pic , starring @entity97 as a super-intelligent avenger ( not to be confused with the super-intelligent avenger she plays in the @entity101 ) , grossed $ 18.3 million this weekend , bringing its two - week domestic haul to $ 79.6 million — a hugely impressive performance for a first - time character without a book , comic , or tv series behind her			0
in fourth place , @entity108 bulked up another $ 10.7 million in its second weekend , contributing to a $ 52.4 million total for the @entity112 vehicle			0
and @entity114 , now in its fourth weekend , earned an estimated $ 8.7 million , bringing its domestic cume to $ 189.3 million — the eighth best of 2014 so far			0
@entity4 -- $ 94 million ( new ) 2			1
@entity93 -- $ 18.3 million ( $ 79.6 million total ) 3			1
@entity69 -- $ 14 million ( new ) 4			1
hercules — $ 10.7 million ( $ 52.3 million total ) 5			0
@entity114 -- $ 8.7 million friday ( $ 189.3 million total ) in the specialty market , two critical darlings raised their theater counts with promising results : the @entity125 thriller @entity124 expanded into 729 theaters , earning $ 3.3 million for a total of $ 7.1 million , while @entity129 's time - spanning opus @entity130 grew to 311 theaters and earned $ 2.52 million this weekend , bringing its total to $ 7.57 million			1
