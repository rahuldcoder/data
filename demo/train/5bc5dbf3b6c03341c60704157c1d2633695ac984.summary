-- of the fall television season , it 's probably safe to say , @entity7 's " @entity6 " was not expected to be the breakout hit , or any hit for that matter			1
the time slot was terrible ( friday nights ) , it had no major stars attached to it and the premise -- grimm fairy tales set in modern times around the banner of a police procedural -- sounds like it could be the cheesiest thing ever			2
the show is dark and imaginative , both in rich , lush set designs and writing that puts a spin on the original grimm tales where they come alive and make sense in the context viewers are given ( short answer : the @entity28 were n't writing early kid - lit ; they were writing about real occurrences )			2
" @entity6 " centers around detective @entity32 ( played by @entity33 ) , who in the first episode finds out he 's a long lost descendent of the @entity37 and is starting to see people for who they really are -- in short , evil			1
@entity33 has been a working actor for the past several years , picking up mostly one - off roles on shows like " @entity43 , " " @entity44 " and " @entity45 " before landing the plum role on " @entity6			1
" @entity0 recently spoke with the actor from the " @entity6 " set in @entity47 , @entity48 , about what makes the show such an unlikely hit and the process of bringing fairy tales to the small screen			1
@entity0 : prior to " grimm , " what were you doing for the most part ? @entity33 : i was a working actor for three or four years before i got " @entity6			1
" i was doing what many actors do in @entity61 : i was working gig to gig			2
i would book a lot of pilots for tv shows that were n't picked up			2
i 'd been positioning myself for the last years to get the show , but it takes so many ... just the right mix of circumstances to take place for a show to go			2
but the first two years i lived in @entity73 , i managed an apartment complex in @entity75			2
so i did n't have to pay rent			0
there were more armenians in @entity75 than i think in actual @entity75			0
@entity0 : what 's a " @entity6 " audition like ? do you have to pretend like wolf people are chasing you ? @entity33 : it 's funny how the audition process is			1
so often you 'll get a script that 's completely retooled by the time you get to the series			1
and that 's what happened			1
i was auditioning with scenes that never made it to the final script			0
for example , in one of my first scenes i auditioned was me telling ( my girlfriend ) @entity99 everything i 'd been seeing and admitting everything to her , right away			0
now , we probably wo n't let that happen for a long time			0
but i did n't have to chase anybody			0
@entity0 : the show 's part police procedural , part fantasy			1
why does this mix work ? @entity33 : it caters to several demographics out there			1
something that surprised me : young people really are enjoying this			1
the " @entity116 " crowd are going crazy for it			0
they 're home on friday nights			0
families are watching this together			0
that really helped it become this little ratings hit for @entity7			0
hopefully the procedural people like it , too			1
let the @entity133 diagram overlap everybody			0
@entity0 : you could be the next @entity136			0
@entity33 : if i stop eating , grow and lose that pesky pigment in my skin			1
@entity0 : but what do you think it is ? that viewers had gotten bored of the run - of - the - mill cop dramas , or that fantasy is just so appealing right now			0
@entity33 : [ attracting the " @entity116 " fans ] is something we did n't consider would happen ; it 's only dawning on us now that it 's happening			1
the people that are visiting our sets , the people that are really going crazy are 25 and younger			1
maybe that 's who goes crazy for anything , but that 's what we 're seeing			1
another thing that 's been postulated is the economic downturn and that people flock to fantasy for escapism			1
i do n't know how true that is , i do n't know if that 's any more true now than it ever was , or people are watching tv now because it 's network and it 's free			1
but it makes sense to me			0
@entity0 : what 's the " @entity6 " set like ? @entity33 : we 're not serious at all			1
we are somewhere between good times and grab - a * *			0
i do n't know what that really means ... no , the cast , we all hit it off			0
we 're all actors and we think we 're funny			0
we do about half our work outside			0
i was just in a rainforest , i swear , two hours ago			0
you make one turn down a windy road and it 's sunny , and the next turn you 're in a cloud and there 's ferns all over the place like @entity192			2
we try to use the aesthetic of the woods and the moss and the light precipitation			0
that 's where " @entity6 " lives aesthetically			1
that mossy , dense forest , which is a great substitute for the @entity202 , which is where the originals were largely set			1
@entity0 : at the table readings , or when you get on set -- have you noticed any difficulties in adapting these old narratives into modern times ? @entity33 : no , i have n't			1
our writing staff is really clever and fairly seamlessly adapt the old fairy tales			0
also , they take liberties			0
they pluck what they want from the original @entity6 fairy tales and discard what they do n't want , in a sense			1
it 's tv , it 's creative , they can do whatever they want			2
i think the joy in it is finding the little nuggets of what is from the fairy tales and what is n't			0
@entity0 : people are weary of remakes			2
did you initially think that re-purposing this material was risky ? @entity33 : people do get worked up over remakes , do n't they ? they feel ownership of the first thing			1
people get worked up about anything			2
i did n't worry about taking this or sullying the @entity6 name or anything like that			1
it 's a creative little spin we 're putting on it			2
@entity0 : the series just got a full 22 - episode order			0
what 's in store for @entity32 ? he seems like a nice guy at this stage			2
a guy you 'd trust your daughter to go out on a date with			0
you could trust your daughter to drive cross country with him upon one meeting			0
i hope that i go from nice guy to bad guy , but who knows ? there 's so many places for it to go			2
i think i learn more about the past coming up here soon			0
i think what happens to a @entity6 , over time , they get hardened and mean			1
" @entity6 " airs at 9 p.m. et , 8 p.m. ct fridays on @entity7			1
a special new episode will air at 10 p.m. thursday following " @entity275			0
