-- @entity2 captain @entity1 says he is happy to stay with the @entity4 side after reported interest from @entity7 giants @entity6			1
@entity1 's future was the subject of much speculation after @entity2 finished seventh last season and failed to qualify for the lucrative @entity12			1
the 30 - year - old delayed any decision until after the @entity15 , where he captained @entity16 to a disappointing second round exit at the hands of @entity19			1
he was linked with a move to @entity21 's @entity6 but he has underlined his commitment to @entity2 after a private meeting with manager @entity24 , who took over from @entity25 earlier this month			1
@entity1 told @entity2 's official website : " i made it clear that i simply needed to concentrate on the @entity15 and then have a decent holiday with my family			1
" i wanted the chance to meet @entity24 privately and having done so i 'm very impressed with his plans for the future of the team			0
" i 've only returned to training on tuesday with some of the other @entity15 players , but i ca n't wait for the new season to start			0
" @entity1 's declaration -- just a day after @entity2 announced the capture of @entity16 international @entity40 -- was welcomed by @entity24 , who is also hoping to persuade @entity42 striker @entity41 to remain at the club			1
" it 's a great piece of news , " @entity24 said			0
" there wo n't be anyone in @entity2 who is n't delighted to hear that			0
i 'm really pleased about it because i 've got great respect for @entity1			2
" he 's a player who i was really looking forward to working with when i came to @entity2			2
it seems now with that commitment that this will happen			0
" it gives everyone a boost without question			0
it will be a tough season , with a lot of matches and the disappointment of last season is going to take a while to dissipate , but it is very good that our best player is still going to be playing at this club			0
" hopefully with the signing of @entity40 -- and if we are lucky one or two others , to boost the squad -- we will be going into this season 's competition , maybe stronger on paper than we were last season			0
" @entity1 said @entity40 was a " great signing " for the club			1
" i know @entity40 well through the @entity16 set - up and have seen first hand just how good a player he is			1
" he 's proved his ability over many years in the @entity4 , sometimes against us - so it will be fantastic to play alongside him in a red shirt for @entity2			2
" i 've told him what a great club this is and i 'm sure @entity40 's the sort of exciting talent our fans will love to see			2
