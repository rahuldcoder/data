-- @entity2 president @entity1 , dogged by widespread speculation about his health , appeared chipper and energetic in a television appearance over the weekend			1
" what a lovely breeze , what lovely weather , " @entity1 said saturday as he opened a meeting with a delegation from @entity8 several weeks before president @entity10 's scheduled visit to the @entity12 nation			1
state - run @entity15 showed @entity1 walking down a long hall with the @entity8 delegation before delivering a speech on the front steps of the palace			1
for @entity1 , a year of health struggles facing a row of cameras , the @entity2 president spoke effusively about his @entity26 revolution , football , friends and the weather			1
live television appearances have long been common for the @entity2 president , but have dwindled in recent months as he undergoes cancer treatment			1
on tuesday , the @entity2 president spoke for several hours , making no mention of his health , during a cabinet meeting that was broadcast live ,			1
eleven months after @entity1 first announced his cancer diagnosis , @entity2 officials have released few details about his treatment			2
neither @entity1 nor anyone in his government have publicly discussed what kind of cancer he has or provided a detailed prognosis for the 57 - year - old leader			0

and i am recuperating gradually , " he said in a may 18 telephone interview with @entity15			0
but speculation has continued to swirl about the president 's political future , and for months many have turned to media accounts for information on @entity1 's health			1
last week , a report from veteran @entity61 television journalist @entity60 described @entity1 's health situation as " dire , " citing an unidentified source 's assessment that the @entity2 president may not see the final results of the october elections due to the progression of his cancer			1
" this reporter has been told that @entity2 president @entity1 has metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma , an aggressive cancer that has ' entered the end stage , ' " @entity60 said on the website for his @entity70 show " @entity71			1
" rather , a longtime @entity77 anchor and " @entity78 " correspondent , said the information came from a " highly respected source close to @entity1 and who is in a position to know his medical condition and history			0
" however , @entity60 said that " there is only one source for identifying the cancer and the prognosis quoted in the first part of the story			0
" he did not disclose the source of his report , which has not been confirmed by @entity0			0
the report -- which also referred to @entity1 as a " dictator " -- drew swift ire from the @entity2 government			2
the next day , the nation 's information ministry distributed an editorial from close @entity1 ally @entity100 titled , " shame on you , @entity60			2
" " @entity60 has always emphasized the necessity of ' courage ' in reporting , yet he shows cowardice and sloppy ambition by racing to publish unconfirmed reports on president @entity1 's health , and by touting slanderous epithets to describe the @entity2 head of state , " @entity100 wrote			1
@entity100 said @entity1 was " a far cry from being on his ' death bed , ' as @entity60 implies			2
" " @entity1 has cancer , and he is fighting it hard , with the same strength he has used to propel his nation forward , often against the toughest obstacles , " she wrote			0
@entity1 , who has ruled oil - rich @entity2 since 1999 , is a controversial figure with outspoken , antagonistic views toward the @entity61			2
his pro-cuban , socialist policies are also controversial domestically and have increasingly polarized the nation and national media , according to the @entity126 - based @entity125 , which provided election monitors in the nation 's 2006 presidential elections			0
recent polls have offered different assessments of how @entity1 's health could impact @entity2 voters when they cast their ballots on october 7			1

the pro-government @entity138 reports that 86 % of the population admires how he has handled his illness and 45.7 % said @entity1 's health had n't affected the national political situation			2
@entity0 affiliate @entity142 reported that polling firm @entity143 , which claims to be independent and has no international affiliation , puts @entity1 at a 51.3 % percent lead in the latest polls ahead of his opponent , @entity147 , who registered a 46.5 %			0
