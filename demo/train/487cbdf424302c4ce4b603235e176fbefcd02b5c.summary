" lawmakers in staunchly @entity41 passed the law in july , but it came into force january 1			1
a person breaks the law by saying or publishing anything " grossly abusive or insulting in relation to matters held sacred by any religion , thereby causing outrage among a substantial number of the adherents of that religion			2
