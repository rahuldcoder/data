-- new zealander @entity1 was appointed head coach of the @entity3 tuesday ahead of the rugby team 's tour of @entity6 next year			1
the @entity8 coach , whose confirmation in the role was delayed after breaking both his heels in an accident in april , will start his role with immediate effect -- but has arranged to lead out the @entity15 for two final matches against @entity17 and @entity6 in late 2012			1
the 2013 tour will mark the 125th anniversary of the @entity3 , who are a selection of the best players from the @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity8			1
the tours only take place once every four years , with the destinations rotating between @entity6 , @entity17 and @entity28			2
the 48 - year - old , who has spent over two decades working in @entity31 rugby , is only the second man from outside the @entity31 to be appointed to lead the @entity3 -- following in the footsteps of compatriot @entity33 , who led the team in 2001			1
" i am really honored to have been asked to take the position of head coach for the 2013 @entity38 to @entity6 , " @entity1 told gathered reporters			1
" a @entity3 tour is unique			2
it is the ultimate career pinnacle for coaches and players			0
i want to ensure that we get the tour environment right so that we are hugely competitive and that our fans are proud of their team			0
" @entity1 worked as an assistant coach when the @entity3 last traveled , which ended with a 2 - 1 series defeat to @entity28 in 2009			1
there will once again be three decisive games against @entity6 , taking place in @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 , but the tour will incorporate a total of ten matches in all -- taking in games against regional and clubs sides to warm up for the international tests			2
@entity6 , who have won the @entity63 on two occasions ( in 1991 and 1999 ) , are currently ranked @entity65 in the world behind the @entity67 " @entity17 " , who won last year 's @entity63 on home soil			0
the @entity3 have lost their last three tours to @entity6 and @entity17 and were last successful there back in 1989			2
" there is no question it will be one hell of a challenge , " @entity1 added			0
" playing in the southern hemisphere is one of rugby 's hardest challenges			0
" after winning two @entity81 titles with @entity8 , as well as steering @entity22 club side wasps to @entity84 glory , @entity1 's potential role as @entity3 coach was thrown into doubt when breaking his heels after falling while cleaning windows at his beach house in @entity17			1
he needed reconstructive surgery to repair his right leg , but @entity3 tour manager @entity91 is convinced he will be up to the arduous task			2
" it has been no secret that after the initial selection process @entity1 was our preferred candidate , " @entity91 said			0
" however , his unfortunate accident earlier this year in @entity17 during the selection process did delay the appointment			0
we naturally had to ensure he would be fit to take up the post			0
those concerns have now been addressed			0
" @entity1 's assistant @entity100 will begin his role as @entity8 caretaker coach for november 's tests against @entity104 and @entity105 , ahead of next year 's @entity81 campaign .			1

@entity1 will coach @entity3 for @entity6 2013 tour
@entity110 is only second man from outside @entity31 isles to lead @entity3
