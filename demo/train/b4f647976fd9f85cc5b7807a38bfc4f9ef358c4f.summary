-- when @entity3 's first child was born , she could have never imagined the girl would grow up to become a @entity6 paralympian who competed in @entity7 and trained for @entity8			1
she could n't dream of anything for her daughter because she did n't know if the baby would even live through the night			1
in the weeks leading up to the delivery , excitement was building for the first grandchild on one side of the @entity3 family , and the third on the other : 150 family and friends feted her with a baby shower at @entity21 , a neighborhood bar owned by her husband 's family for three generations			1
@entity3 lives in a tight - knit community in @entity27 called @entity28			0
surrounded by water on three sides , it is as small - town as you can get inside a borough with a population of more than 2 million			0
it is where i grew up ( i knew the @entity3 family growing up , but was n't aware of @entity40 's story until now )			1
the big day finally arrived			0
after three or four normal sonograms , @entity3 , then 27 years old , went into labor			0
" and out comes the baby , and the room goes quiet , " she said during a recent interview			0
the doctors and nurses were stunned			2
in fact , a neonatalogist told @entity3 that he had never seen anything like it in over 20 years of practicing , the mother of five told me			0
her daughter , who would be named @entity40 , was born with no eyelids , underdeveloped ears and other facial deformities			1
her vision was dramatically impacted because amniotic fluid inside the womb damaged her corneas			0
@entity3 , who had to be rushed into the operating room after delivery because she was hemorrhaging , did n't see her baby until 12 hours later			2
she remembers the maternity nurse who took her to see @entity40 for the first time			1
" ' now you stop your crying , you get on your knees and you pray			0
... let 's go mama , ' " @entity3 said the nurse told her			2
" she gave me that smack in the face i needed			0
" the doctors told her @entity40 might die , become mentally challenged or legally blind			1
" they did n't know what to do so they just put her under the jaundice lights , " she said			2
when someone dropped a tray , and @entity40 jumped , she and her husband knew their baby could hear sounds and decided they had to get her into a hospital with more specialized care			1
" it 's been pretty much a miracle ever since			2
" ' she was fully accepted ' when @entity40 was just 3 days old , she had the first of some 70 surgeries she would have over the next 24 years			1
doctors determined she had @entity95 , an extremely rare genetic disorder characterized by various physical abnormalities that could affect the head and facial area , the skin , and fingers , according to the @entity102			1
after nearly 10 weeks in the hospital , @entity40 , who is called @entity103 by her family and friends , came home			1
" and it was like the floodgates of @entity28 opened , " said @entity3 , remembering the love and support she received , especially that first time she walked baby @entity111 in a stroller down the main avenue running throughout the community			0
" she was fully accepted , so that gave us strength to put her out in the world ... and it did n't stop			2
" it did n't stop , indeed			2
@entity40 , who is legally blind and partially hearing impaired , would go on to ski in the @entity123 in @entity7 and get into @entity124 , where she is studying social and cognitive neuroscience			1
she got her @entity124 admissions letter and her nomination letter to the @entity6 ski team in the same week during her senior year in high school			1
" it was just so powerful for me because this was years of work and sacrifice , and to have it all come together in this one , two , three day span , it was like wow , this actually happened			0
this was all worth it , " @entity40 told me during an interview			1
she owes everything to her mom , and her dad @entity146 , a @entity147 firefighter , she said			0
" if it was n't for them ... i would n't be here today because so many other people could have ( broken ) under that kind of pressure and that kind of decision making , " she said			1
" my syndrome is so rare			2
... it was n't even something that they had a plan of action for from previous examples			2
" a passion grows out of tragedy @entity147 communities were hit hard by the september 11 terror attacks , including @entity28 , which is home to many firefighters			0
the inlet community lost residents , including two members of the @entity170			0
charitable offers to firefighters to attend concerts and meet celebrities poured in , and @entity177 , deeply in pain , turned them all down , his wife said			0
@entity179 , a group that tries to help people with disabilities live full lives through sports , offered an all - expenses paid trip to @entity186 , @entity187 , to @entity146 and @entity3 along with 11 - year - old @entity40 and their three other children at the time			1
@entity3 jumped at the chance , but @entity146 was reluctant , thinking it was a scam to commit the family into buying something			0
" @entity195 's like , ' i 'm not going			2
it 's a time - share spiel , ' " said @entity3			2
four years later , @entity146 received a lifetime achievement award from @entity179			0
now he travels to @entity187 every year to volunteer along with his entire family			0
besides inspiring the @entity201 to give back through volunteering , that trip did something else			0
it gave birth to @entity40 's love affair with ski racing			1
at first , @entity40 was a bit of a chicken on the mountain , she said , but over time she got more aggressive , and decided to give racing a try when the @entity212 , a group the family volunteers with in @entity215 , @entity147 , started a race team and asked her to join			1
" i did like the feeling it gave you , like a freedom , " said @entity40			1
" and then i just fell in love with racing because it was a controlled environment to be out of control almost			0
" always reaching higher as a super high - achiever , who took advanced placement courses in high school even while missing up to 10 weeks of classes to train , she set her sights on the next big goal			0
" what 's the next thing i can do , what 's the next thing i can achieve ? " she remembers thinking at the time			2
" i need to make the @entity6 ski team			0
" after her first semester at @entity124 , @entity40 took 2Â½ years off to train for @entity7 , the site of the @entity123			1
@entity235 : @entity237 opening ceremony family , friends and other supporters -- 38 people in all -- traveled to cheer on @entity40 at the games			1
" mostly all of them had known me since i was a baby ... so for them to kind of experience that transition with us was kind of incredible , " said @entity40 , who finished sixth in two races and eighth in another			1
she would gain national exposure when @entity251 , through its " thank you , @entity256 " program , saluting the moms behind the athletes , chose to feature her in a campaign , along with four @entity259 athletes : speedskater @entity260 , moguls skier @entity261 , ice hockey team player @entity262 and snowboarder @entity263			2
" it meant so much that they acknowledged the @entity237 , " said @entity40			1
" i did n't even get a medal in @entity7 , but they thought my story was good enough to include with these other amazing athletes			1
" this year , @entity251 created its first ad specifically for the @entity237 , which @entity40 said is another huge step in putting the @entity259 for athletes with disabilities on the map			1
the @entity237 wrap up sunday in @entity8			0
getting the gold after 2Â½ years at @entity124 , @entity40 decided to make a run for @entity8			1
she took a year and a half off from school , and moved to @entity279			0
@entity280 , @entity281 , along with her 20 - year - old sister @entity282 , who would train to be her guide			0
all visually impaired downhill skiers have a guide , who skis in front of them and helps direct them down the mountain			1
but during a warm - up run in december , when @entity40 said she was giving it her all , her dream of a second @entity296 run came crashing to an end			1
she got a concussion during a wipe out , missed five weeks of training and did not secure a spot on the @entity301			0
the girl who achieved everything she set out to do now faced something she had never faced before			0
" this is the first time @entity40 ever set out for anything and it did n't happen , " said @entity3			1
in an e-mail to family , friends and supporters , @entity40 told them her @entity8 hopes were over , thanked them for their support and then attached an e-mail from the mother of a child who has a disability			1
" the e-mail was inspiring			0
she said i love your story			0
you gave me so much hope , " said @entity40 , who is back home in @entity27 , volunteering with the @entity212 and looking for internships this summer before returning to @entity124 in the fall			1
" i kind of attached a little bit of that e-mail and said , ' listen this is why i want to do it			0
i want to raise awareness			2
' " " and ( if ) you look at it from that way , i won			0
i got the gold medal , " she told her supporters			0
" i do n't need to go to @entity8			2
" what do you think it takes to raise a child with disabilities ? @entity342 in below in the comments or tell @entity344 on @entity345 or @entity346 on @entity347 .			2
