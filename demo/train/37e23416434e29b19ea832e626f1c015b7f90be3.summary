-- it is one place where they wish that business was n't booming			2
" our numbers are way up this year , i 'm sad to say , " said @entity6 , of @entity7 , @entity8			1
@entity6 is the staff member in charge of the program at @entity7 's three elementary schools that , each friday , quietly provides food that will get children through the weekend			1
some of you may have read the report in this column last november that explained the program , and the heart - wrenching need for it			0
in @entity7 , as in many school districts , free or reduced - priced breakfasts and lunches are served during the week to children whose families have hit rough economic times			1
but school officials in @entity7 had noticed that some children were coming to school hungry on monday mornings			1
there had n't been enough food in their homes to feed them on saturdays and sundays -- or the parents , for whatever reason , had not been around to prepare meals			1
so the backpack program was initiated			0
using empty backpacks donated by local merchants , @entity6 and volunteers at the @entity7 elementary schools loaded the packs with enough food to get the boys and girls through the weekends			1
the backpacks were left in the school hallways by the end of the day on fridays ; the idea was that the children who needed them could pick them up to take home and not be embarrassed			1
the backpacks filled with food looked no different from the regular backpacks that children stored in the hallways between classes -- the hungry children could unobtrusively sling them over their shoulders and not feel a stigma about needing the help			1
we are always reading reports about fluctuations in the national economy			0
the numbers can be confusing and contradictory			0
are things getting a little better ? are there new downturns ? the figures coming out of @entity75 and @entity76 are sometimes difficult for those of us who are not financial experts to decipher			0
so , as @entity81 approaches this year , i thought i 'd check back in @entity7			1
last year i was told that 106 children needed the backpacks full of donated food to make it through the weekends			1
@entity7 is just one small town in rural @entity8 , but i thought by asking if that number had gone down , or up , or had stayed about the same , it could provide a different kind of indicator of how the economy is doing in daily - life terms			1
i was hoping that the number of families whose elementary - school children did n't have enough food on the weekends had markedly dropped , signifying that good economic times were reappearing			1
" the number has more than doubled , " @entity6 said			1
" from the 106 children last year , it has grown to 287			2
" she knows the families who are in the program			2
the parents have to apply in order for the children to discreetly be provided the weekly backpacks of food			1
" we 've had people apply who tell us that they 've never had to do anything like this before , " @entity6 said			0
" they never thought that they 'd be having to ask for help			0
" she , like the rest of us , has read the occasional optimistic story about the economy bouncing back			0
" i 'd like to think it was happening , " she said , " but we 're seeing the opposite here			0
it takes a long time for a positive change in the economy to reach the people on the bottom			0
for the people we are asked to help , things have been bad for so long that they will be the last to feel the effects of any recovery			2
" why has the number of children needing food for the weekends increased so dramatically ? " people who were just hanging on by their fingernails last year ca n't hang on any more , " she said			1
" we have families who have had to buddy - up on their homes -- they may have had their own homes , but now two and three families are living in one home , to share expenses			2
people who were too proud to ask for help have said that now they have to swallow their pride and say they ca n't make it on their own			2
they say that it 's more important to make sure their kids get fed. " at the @entity156 in @entity157 , @entity8 , which provides much of the food for the backpack program in @entity7 's schools , the executive director , @entity155 , said that @entity6 's observations were accurate , and that the continuing hard times are not limited to @entity7			1
" i 've been doing this for eighteen - and - a - half years , " @entity163 said			0
" i have never seen the need so high			0
" at this time last year , she said , her food bank was providing help to 3,700 children at 80 schools in her part of @entity8			1
this year , she said , the number is 6,300 children in 112 schools			1
" we always felt we were recession - proof around here , " she said			0
after all , @entity8 is part of @entity180 's breadbasket			1
" but whatever recovery there is has n't gotten to the heartland yet			2
" she said a man came in recently who had at one time been a donor to her food bank			2
" he dropped his head , " she said			0
" he said , ' i have been giving to your program for years			0
but i have n't had a job for 18 months			2
i 'm here as a last resort to ask for your help			0
i need to feed my kids			2
' " in @entity7 , the superintendent of schools , @entity198 , told me that his fondest dream would be if the number of children requiring the backpacks of food each friday would drop to zero			1
" it really affects the learning environment when a child comes to school so hungry after the weekend , " he said			0
" how can you concentrate on trying to learn when your mind is on where your next meal is coming from ? " so , as another @entity81 approaches , the efforts go on			0
i asked @entity155 how she and her staff at the food bank deal with the continuing need			0
" you 're asking a lady who prays all the time , " she said			0
" i believe that @entity219 will provide , and i believe in the goodness of people			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 .			2

children whose families need food are helped discreetly in @entity7 , @entity8
@entity224 says the number of kids picking up backpacks of food has more than doubled
some may talk of an economic *rebound* , but it does n't feel that way in @entity7 , he says
