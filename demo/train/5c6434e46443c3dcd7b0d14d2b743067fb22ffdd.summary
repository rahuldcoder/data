@entity0 , @entity1 -- during @entity6 mayor @entity5 's recent visit to @entity0 on an investment promotion trip , he jokingly declared that he is " mayor of the eighth emirate			1
" though uttered in typical self - deprecating jest , the mayor of the world 's greatest city proclaiming that @entity6 is a mere province of the @entity1 is revealing about how @entity0 's fortunes have revived since the punishing real estate crash and debt restructuring following the financial crisis			1
with the @entity18 economy slumping so severely that the @entity19 has recommended it reconsider its austerity policy , @entity5 has to look abroad to maintain @entity6 's economic dynamism			2
he particularly appealed to the @entity1 's sovereign wealth funds ( such as the @entity23 and @entity24 ) to invest in @entity6 's underground subway upgrades ( not that @entity1 are regulars on the @entity26 , since they often ship their supercharged @entity28 sports cars to @entity6 for the summer months )			2
thirty years ago , when i was a child growing up in the @entity1 , @entity0 's highlights were a cheap revolving restaurant in the creek district of @entity33 and the modest gold souk of nearby @entity35			1
but a revolutionary transformation was also just under way under the visionary leadership of @entity39 , and subsequently carried forward by his third son @entity40 , who currently rules @entity0 while also serving as prime minister and vice president of the @entity1			1
more from @entity44 : is @entity45 ready to take sporting center stage ? decades of heavy infrastructure investment built what is today one of the world 's busiest ports at @entity52 , and the world 's most transited airport			1
at any hour of the day , @entity0 's @entity55 is the single most cosmopolitan building in the world , with every conceivable nationality transiting , visiting , or settling			1
the @entity59 , located at the base of the world 's tallest building , the @entity58 , was visited 65 million times in 2012 , more than any other monument in the world			0
the increasingly populous and built - up corridor connecting @entity67 and @entity0 have inspired many to refer to this core axis as " @entity0 , " the unofficial capital of the entire @entity71			1
in time , all seven emirates -- and all the @entity74 ( @entity74 ) countries -- will be linked by a coastal high - speed rail network			0
led by the largest economy of @entity77 , the @entity74 collectively deserves a place in any conversation about the " @entity80			0
" huge real estate projects , central geography , and reconciliation with its fraternal capital @entity67 made @entity0 resilient to the crisis in ways almost every global analyst missed			1
those who erroneously wrote gloating " @entity0 is finished " headlines are derisively referred to here as " the haters			1
" ironically , they come from the same places -- @entity95 and @entity96 -- that now send officials and out - of - work executives desperately seeking investment and jobs in the @entity1			0
would you rather be in @entity102 right now ? in his penetrating new book " @entity105 , " author @entity106 matter - of - factly declares @entity0 as the center of the world			1
but he also sketches a portrait of a place that is not just a city , but an idea , and a dream			0
in one generation , @entity0 has graduated from a village that people just fly over , to an instant city in the desert , to a destination for migrant workers and expatriates , to a world financial center and demographic microcosm of the planet			1
just a couple of years after its economic crisis it feels like the center of the world again			0
in the traditional but affluent beachfront district of @entity134 , the aesthetic matches the geography of being halfway between @entity95 and @entity131 : patisseries next to sari shops			0
an even further concentric circle of cultures is represented : @entity138 and @entity140 massage parlors			1
more from @entity141 : @entity142 , not revolution , in @entity144 geography plays a major role in @entity0 's rebound			1
the @entity1 's largest trading partners are @entity140 and @entity131			1
@entity131 are the second largest investors in the all - important property market ( behind @entity1 ) ; they flock here as the most convenient meeting point for far - flung diaspora families			0
like anyone else , they also enjoy functioning infrastructure ; hence the saying that @entity0 is @entity131 's best - run city			1
( if only @entity0 were still administered by the @entity155 , when its currency was the rupee			1
) @entity0 has also become a crucial outpost for @entity140 , with more than 2,000 @entity140 companies registered in the @entity1			1
while many have visited the sprawling @entity162 complex where low - cost @entity140 goods are sold wholesale , an estimated 180,000 @entity140 people reside in the country , including senior figures for state - run banks who negotiate joint investment opportunities in @entity170 with @entity172 companies			1
the @entity173 ( @entity173 ) is their neutral meeting ground , offering a one - stop shop for legal , financial , accounting and other services			0
the @entity1 also wisely plays a neutral game of multi-alignment with the superpowers : major arms deals with the @entity182 , massive energy exports to @entity140 , and billions in investment from @entity95			2
whether or not @entity140 is able to avoid the " @entity189 trap " by building pipeline and railways across @entity187 to the @entity71 , it will still need @entity0 as its hub for its growing reach into the @entity71 and @entity170			1
last week 's third consecutive government - sponsored @entity192 ( @entity194 ) in @entity0 featured businessmen and officials from 114 emerging markets , showing how the city is the most convenient meeting point for the globe - spanning webs of commerce forming across @entity96 , @entity170 , and @entity187			1
with its location at the intersection of three continents , @entity0 captures not only the shift in economic power from @entity208 to @entity71 , but also the rise of the @entity210			2
forty percent of the world 's population lives on the @entity214 rim , and @entity0 is the financial crossroads for their growing trade and financial relationships			1
@entity0 is increasingly the hub for companies investing across @entity170 , and home to domestic powerhouses like @entity222 , which is operating ports from @entity224 to @entity225 , and @entity226 , the only airline capable of flying non-stop from @entity0 to every major city in the world			1
when you fly on @entity226 , the pilots need several full breaths to list the languages spoken by the staff , usually including @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity237 , @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity240 and half - dozen others			0
in his forthcoming book @entity243 , veteran tech entrepreneur @entity242 points out that @entity0 is effectively the commercial capital for companies looking to gain access to about 300 million @entity249 consumers			1
according to @entity251 , the @entity1 itself has the highest rate of mobile penetration in the world , with 176 phones per 100 people			0
smart phone penetration is expected to grow to 50 % in @entity258 in the next five years			0
@entity259 argues that @entity172 vcs need to be greater risk takers , the way @entity1 - based ones already are			0
@entity264 , the largest private equity fund in the @entity71 , has investments in 43 countries from @entity268 to @entity269			0
only at conferences in @entity0 does one find billboards advertising @entity269 as " vibrant , " and find investors talking about the " huge opportunities " there			2
perhaps the greatest geopolitical risk to the region is also what will become the @entity1 's next big opportunity : @entity278			0
it is unlikely that @entity278 will spend the rest of the decade as an isolated pariah			0
whether by war or diplomacy , with or without nuclear weapons , the giant @entity283 nation in the region 's heart will be open for business			2
the smuggling business that has thrived for decades between @entity0 and @entity278 will graduate to @entity0 becoming the full - blown staging point for all parties involved in @entity278 's economic rehabilitation			1
with such strong , unchallenged and popular leadership , the @entity1 has wound up a beneficiary of the @entity296			0
free of the troubles of @entity258 , @entity302 , and other @entity249 states , " @entity0 is where you come to forget you 're in the @entity71 , " according to one commentator			2
just as it benefited in the 1970s and ' 80s from @entity306 's descent into civil war , the @entity1 is now absorbing an estimated 15,000 @entity249 a month from @entity308 and @entity302 , but also @entity77 and @entity258			0
the best and the brightest -- and wealthiest -- are hedging their bets , fed - up with civil war or democracy			0
while the country is relatively open , tolerant and progressive , its freedoms come at a price			1
@entity316 has recently reported on crackdowns of free speech , closure of @entity321 affiliates , intimidation and imprisonment of dissidents , continued human trafficking , and poor protection of foreign worker rights			0
and as in countries in @entity208 and @entity71 , security cameras are now ubiquitous , reminding of the underlying securitization that enables the peaceful daily order			0
even as these issues receive growing scrutiny , @entity0 is undeniably the deserving favorite to host the @entity335 ( the winner will be announced in november )			2
the @entity1 biggest long - term challenge is demographic			0
the @entity1 and @entity338 are unique in the world as nations whose indigenous populations are all but disappearing relative to the influx of foreigners			0
the country 's population has tripled in just the past decade to over ten million people , yet @entity1 make up less than 10 % of the entire population			2
the prominent academic @entity349 is a provocative and thoughtful embodiment of the dilemma the @entity1 's success has brought about : on the one hand , he praises his country 's spectacular modernization , but he has also sounded the alarm that @entity357 identity is being extinguished , his tribe becoming extinct			2
at the same time , though @entity0 has by far the highest foreign - born population rate in the world , it is not quite the melting pot @entity363 is			2
to achieve that level of permanent , inter-ethnic integration , the @entity1 will have to transform itself from post-modern feudalism to an innovative stakeholdership model in which foreigners are accorded long - term residency rights , and both citizens and foreigners have meaningful rights as well as responsibilities			0
if it does so , it can be a role model for dozens of other cities that are becoming multi-ethnic global hubs			0
that is exactly what the world expects from the city at its center			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity44 .			2

@entity0 's fortunes have revived since real estate crash and debt restructuring
in a generation , @entity0 has graduated from village to global financial center , demographic microcosm
@entity395 has become crucial outpost for @entity140 ; 2,000 @entity140 companies registered there
country is open and tolerant ; @entity44 says freedom of expression has suffered
