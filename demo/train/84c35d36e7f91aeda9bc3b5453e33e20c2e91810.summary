-- when did conservatives become prisoners to idiotic vulgarity ? i ask that question as someone who self - defines as conservative and who is sick and tired of being embarrassed by @entity9			1
last month the aged rocker called president @entity11 a " subhuman mongrel " in an interview with @entity14			2
that was bad enough , but what was just as shocking was the willingness of @entity19 gubernatorial nominee @entity18 to keep him aboard his campaign			1
@entity21 and @entity22 also failed to rule out appearing with him			2
only @entity23 took to @entity24 to demand an apology , which @entity9 eventually gave			1
he downgraded @entity11 to a " liar , " which is , at least , a more colorblind insult			2
there is a view that @entity9 simply " speaks his mind , " and , yes , he has every constitutionally guaranteed right to do so			1
maybe what he says appeals to some people , those for whom good manners are a bourgeois affectation and correct spelling the preserve of @entity37 pointy - heads			2
@entity9 insists comments not racist , promises to stop ' calling people names ' either way , what is disturbing is that some serious @entity43 politicians think that he matters and are happy to count him among their endorsements -- as though selling records and getting angry make him a spokesman for the masses			1
animal from the @entity49 also speaks his mind , but we 've yet to see him headlining a rally for @entity52			2
this is n't what conservatism is supposed to be about			1
conservatism is the rejection of ideology in favor of common sense and anger in favor of cool rationalism			1
of course , there have always been intemperate voices on the @entity66 right -- from @entity67 to the @entity68			2
( i 'm not including @entity72 @entity71 racists such as @entity73 because their place on the political compass is impossible to plot			0
) but the @entity66 right has an intellectual tradition that has all been forgotten by the media in recent years			1
there were the @entity80 ( @entity81 ) , the anti-communists ( @entity99 ) , the libertarians ( @entity83 , @entity84 ) , the traditionalists ( @entity86 ) , the neo-conservatives ( @entity88 ) , and the sages of the @entity90 ( @entity91 , @entity93 @entity92 , @entity94 ) -- the latter embodied by the urbane , cosmopolitan wit of @entity97			0
most of these groups quietly linger around today , largely ignored in the noisy mess of 21st - century politics but still patiently taught at some colleges and think tanks			0
in modern - day @entity107 , you 'll find all the @entity110 @entity43 interns spending sunday at @entity111 on @entity112 and weekday nights at lectures by bishops on the nature of good and evil			0
not at the assault weapon firing range			0
sometime in the 1970s , the intellectual right made common cause with populism , and historians such as @entity123 tell us that this is when they surrendered their brains to cultural conservatism			1
but @entity127 was neither inarticulate nor rude			0
he was happy , sunny , funny , and his speeches so dense with philosophy and history that they make @entity11 sound like a high school student			0
crucially , he had a faith in the intelligence of the average @entity66 , which meant he did n't resort to meanness or bad syntax to win their vote			0
@entity127 would never call an opponent " subhuman			0
" so how do we explain the rudeness of contemporary politics ? @entity9 's followers might insist that his language reflects the desperate seriousness of his cause , that any conversation about fundamental issues such as guns or @entity151 is bound to cause a loss of temper			1
but in the 1960s the @entity80 were debating urban riots , sex , drugs and @entity157 -- and yet the @entity19 sold itself as a party that could resolve these challenges with calm sensibleness			2
@entity161 ran as an antidote to the chaos caused by the left , offering order over anarchy			0
what has changed is that back then conservative politicians had faith in themselves and their own philosophy , that it would win out because it was right and middle - class @entity66 could see that			0
today 's breed are all too often chasing a " base " that , they imagine , includes yahoos , survivalists and people who think the world is both flat and about to come to an end			1
this pursuit of the base ends with basically intelligent men deferring to those who are rightly socially unacceptable			1
cue @entity185 in 2008 being told by supporters that @entity11 is an @entity187 , or @entity188 nearly paralyzed with socially awkwardness as he courted the @entity190 in 2012			0
and it ends in politicians failing to call @entity9 out for being a @entity193			1
as the midterms approach , conservative presidential aspirants face this challenge : can they elevate rather than reduce the political debate ? @entity23 has made a good start , and it 's probably because he is driven by philosophy and all the self - assurance that brings			2
for the rest , i 'd like to see them defy a few stereotypes			0
rather than being photographed shooting bears or doing pushups with @entity207 , let journalists catch them reading a book			0
@entity86 is a good place to start			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity214 .			1

@entity216 : conservatives mostly let @entity9 's outrageous remarks *slide*
it 's shocking they seem *afraid* to *dissociate* themselves from @entity9 , he says
he asks : what happened to the intellectual tradition of conservatism ?
@entity214 : the pursuit of the party base leads to a surrender of rationality
