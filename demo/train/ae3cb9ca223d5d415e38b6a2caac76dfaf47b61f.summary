-- in @entity3 , getting from point a to @entity2 can be a perilous business			2
towns are remote , the roads that link them are poor and prone to attack , while the coastline is manned by pirates			0
so why are so many airline operators eager to launch routes to @entity12 ? despite @entity3 's many security woes , the aviation industry is experiencing an uptick			1
@entity12 's @entity16 -- which was essentially out of commission prior to 2010 following years of civil war , in - fighting and a reign of terror brought on by @entity21 - backed terrorist group @entity20 -- has been expanding			1
" before 2010 , there was n't really an airport , just a runway			2
now , we have 35 flights a day			1
the airport is booming , " says @entity27 , @entity28 's station manager			1
security in the country is an on - going concern , though it has improved			2
@entity20 was forced out two years ago , allowing some local businesses to reopen and @entity28 to beef up its security , which is currently under the purview of the @entity41 ( @entity41 ) , the @entity33 and @entity34 , the @entity3 police , the @entity36 , and @entity37 -- the consulting firm charged with the airline 's renaissance			1
" the airport is very different from the town			2
there are 17,000 troops protecting it			1
we have four x-ray machines and several security checks passengers have to pass through before boarding a plane , " explains @entity27			2
these measures has given confidence to a range of carriers			0
@entity58 -- @entity3 's unofficial national carrier -- has expanded its network and fleet considerably , and several neighboring outfits , like @entity63 and @entity64 , have daily flights throughout the country			1
last month , @entity67 started flying three times a week to @entity12 , and last year , @entity69 @entity58 became the first major commercial airline to service the @entity3 capital in over 20 years			1
@entity27 envisions more international carriers , particularly some of the @entity74 's heavy hitters , launching routes soon			2
watch : turning around @entity77 aviation still , violence remains an everyday reality			0
last month a car bomb was driven into a convoy of @entity41 troops near the airport			1
if anything , the country 's lack of infrastructure and stability is actually boosting the airline industry			0
" the population is sparsely distributed throughout the territory			0
traveling by land is dangerous -- not just because the roads are bad , but because of highway robbery			0
police checkpoints charge you $ 50 just to pass through			0
for ordinary people , as well as @entity102 peacekeepers , flying domestically is really the best way to go , " says @entity97 , head of business development and start - up airlines at aviation consulting firm @entity100			1
for big carriers , like @entity106 , flying to @entity3 represents a bigger strategy of gaining a foothold in @entity77 as a whole			1
in 2012 , the airline expanded its network to include 15 destinations throughout the continent			0
" the most important geographic part of the world over the next 100 years will be @entity77			0
in this respect , any destination ( we fly to ) in @entity77 will create more effective results than , say , a destination in @entity122 , " says @entity116 , @entity106 ' senior vice president of media relations			1
despite the increase in competition , airfares remain remarkably high			0
even low - cost carriers charge upwards of $ 500 for internal flights			0
" for the airlines operating these routes , the costs are very high -- much higher than they would be flying similar - sized aircraft with the same number of passengers in @entity122 , because you do n't have the infrastructure , plus you 're paying a premium to pilots and crew for being in a place they do n't want to be , " says @entity97			1

" all operators flying to @entity3 have to be given a special permit , because the country is considered a hostile destination			1
we take into account every factor and calculated risk , and have never been involved in any unsafe or unstable situation , " he says			0
surprisingly for a country whose economy is in shambles , there are plenty of passengers willing to pay the fare			0
" @entity3 are very resilient , and they get a lot of money from the diaspora , " explains @entity27 , who adds that @entity102 and @entity167 traffic keeps the demand for seats high			0
@entity63 cites 90 % occupancy , and @entity106 says the load factor is increasing			2
" judging by the amount of traffic the airport is seeing , i 'd say there 's plenty of profits to be had , " says @entity27 .			2

business at @entity12 's airport is " booming " , with up to 35 flights *scheduled* each day .
last year , @entity106 was the the first major carrier to fly to @entity12 *25* years .
airlines are *heartened* by the tight airport security . currently 17,000 troops protect the airport .
pilots and crew are paid more for operating in what is still *classified* as a hostile destination
