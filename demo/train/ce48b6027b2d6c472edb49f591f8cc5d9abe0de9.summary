house speaker @entity0 flatly denied tuesday that congressional @entity1 are moving to impeach president @entity2 , blasting talk about it as " a scam started by @entity6 at the @entity7			1
" " we have no plans to impeach the president			2
we have no future plans , " @entity0 told reporters after a weekly meeting with @entity1 members			1
@entity0 said " this whole talk about impeachment " comes from " the president 's own staff " and from congressional @entity6			1
" why ? because they 're trying to rally their people to give money and to show up in this year 's elections , " he said			0
@entity0 has emphasized several times publicly that he disagrees with former @entity1 vice presidential candidate @entity24 and other conservatives pushing impeachment over their claims @entity2 's grossly exceeded his executive authority			1
a recent @entity31 - @entity30 opinion poll shows that almost two thirds of @entity33 do not believe @entity2 deserves to be impeached			0
in that same poll , however , a partisan split shows that 57 % of @entity1 support such a step , while 86 % of @entity6 and 63 % of @entity37 do n't			1
@entity7 : game on @entity0 's decision to sue @entity2 was designed to address outrage from tea party activists and others within the @entity1 base over a string of @entity2 executive orders they say circumvented @entity47			1
the lawsuit covers his decision last year to defer a health law requirement that businesses provide insurance coverage to their employees			0
but the suit also opened the door to more discussion about impeaching the second - straight @entity6 president by a @entity1 - led @entity7			1
the issue was magnified when incoming @entity7 @entity1 whip @entity59 of @entity60 refused to take the issue off the table during an interview over the weekend			1
@entity64 , a longtime aide and senior @entity2 adviser said last week that impeachment talk should not be considered a long shot			2
" i would not discount that possibility , " @entity64 said			0
@entity64 said that the lawsuit was evidence republicans would consider impeachment down the road			0
congressional democrats have seized on the issue and show no sign of letting up			0
senate majority leader @entity76 raised the subject on the @entity79 floor on tuesday at about the same time @entity0 was ruling it out			0
" look in the papers today , the @entity33 people are totally opposed to this , " @entity76 said			0
" we should n't be off on those tracks of impeachment and suing the president			2
" in the month since @entity0 announced his lawsuit , the @entity87 has raised nearly $ 7.6 million ahead of the november midterms			0
but the campaign arm has pulled in $ 1 million alone since @entity59 's comments on impeachment over the weekend			0
with the resolution to formally authorize the lawsuit expected on the @entity7 floor on wednesday , @entity7 @entity6 are likely to continue to argue , regardless of @entity0 's comments , that that move is simply the first step toward impeachment			1
@entity100 : any attempt to impeach @entity2 would be distraction			2

@entity0 says talk of impeachment coming from @entity6 and @entity7
he says @entity7 @entity1 has no plans to impeach @entity2 over executive actions
@entity24 and other conservatives are pushing for such a step
@entity0 , however , is suing the president over @entity114
