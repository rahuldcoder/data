it began with secret texts to untraceable phones			0
meetings took place in seedy bars , dark alleys , gas stations			0
actual documents came in packages without notes , without return addresses			0
you would think the secrets being passed dealt with national security , organized crime or the corruption of high public officials			0
the secrets these whistleblowers began telling @entity20 last summer dealt with the deplorable treatment , or lack of treatment , of @entity25 veterans			1
but why all that secrecy ? employees of the @entity25 @entity28 , from all across the country , told us people who speak out face retaliation that could end their careers and permanently harm their family 's finances and futures			1
today , the @entity37 announced details from @entity40 whistleblower cases illustrating just how true that fear at the @entity40 has become			1
the @entity37 announced it is now looking into allegations of reprisals against 37 employees from the @entity28			1
the @entity37 said it has received the complaints from employees at @entity40 facilities in 19 states			1
and the complaints run the gamut -- from allegations of retaliation for disclosing improper scheduling practices to retaliation for exposing other threats to patient care			1
" receiving candid information about harmful practices from employees will be critical to the @entity40 's efforts to identify problems and find solutions , " said special counsel @entity57			1
" however , employees will not come forward if they fear retaliation			1
" @entity57 's staff recently blocked disciplinary actions against three @entity40 employees after they " disclosed wrongdoing			1
" @entity57 's staff says the @entity40 agreed to hold off on the proposed discipline			1
this will allow the @entity37 to further investigate the reprisal claims , they said			1
in the just the past fiscal year , the @entity37 has fought the punishment of 14 @entity40 employees who had been retaliated against for being critical of the agency			1
@entity40 doctors scared to talk last fall , six doctors in @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 , @entity82 , came forward to describe to @entity20 how delayed colonoscopies and endoscopies had led to the death of as many as 20 veterans			1
none would appear on camera			0
none would even allow us to quote them			0
but they begged @entity20 to tell the story			1
one doctor would meet only privately in an unpopular , seedy restaurant where he felt certain no one would recognize him			2
another doctor only met with us and spoke in a dark , outside location where no one could see him			0
another doctor asked us to only speak through a third - person intermediary , providing documents that could not be traced but that could be authenticated to provide us reliable sourcing			1
code word : ' @entity107 ' on background , @entity20 began conversing with one of the doctors who was so frightened of retaliation that he asked that we text him on a private , untraceable cell phone using coded language			1
and he asked that any phone calls or e-mails had to start with the words " @entity107 , " as a way to identify it was " safe " to move ahead with him			0
several of the doctors , we were told , had tried to tell administrators of their concerns that patients were being harmed by delays and that some had died or suffered serious injuries			0
but we were told those doctors were treated harshly by administrators who did not want to hear of the complaints			0
all the doctors confirmed to us that @entity40 officials had posted warnings in the hospital 's halls and elevators that no @entity40 employees could speak with the media or divulge details of what went on inside the hospital			1
the warnings , the doctors said , included details about laws that could be violated and penalties that employees could face , including financial reparations and even jail time , if they were to speak out publicly , and if the hospital suffered financial losses as a result			1
in @entity154 , more fear and dread just like the fear in @entity79 and @entity81 , the source in @entity157 was scared to trust us			0
we were told to meet at a bar in a strip mall 20 miles outside of downtown			0
no cameras , no notes and the pounding rock music was so loud , it is doubtful even a hidden microphone would have worked			0
but it was here we heard the entire story of the secret list in @entity157			0
the employee would not allow us to use a name , a position , even a length of service			0
and we are deliberately leaving out his / her gender			0
the @entity40 employee remains scared to this day , but everything said inside the seedy bar has proved to be true			2
a fatal wait : read the original @entity157 story that started it all the secret list , the destruction and the cover - up through intimidation had been in place for more than a year			2
it was n't secret to anyone inside the @entity40			2
but what this employee was telling us was the other " not - so secret " secret -- about what happened to anyone who spoke against the administration			0
@entity196 , the now ex-director of the @entity40 , had a common retort to any naysayer who complained , we were told : " if you do n't like it here , let me buy you a @entity202 bus pass			2
" the bus stop was right under the sixth - floor window of @entity196 's office			0
@entity208 , a whistleblower who worked under @entity196 at the @entity209 outside of @entity210 , says , " there 's a lot of fear , employees are scared to step up when they see things that are negligent ... " @entity208 says when the news broke in @entity154 surrounding secret lists and @entity196 , no one was surprised			2
" it 's something that is regular business , nobody is shocked that it 's in the news , in fact people are relieved that finally people , employees are being heard , that this is a huge problem			2
" we heard the same thing from other whistleblowers as they came forward in @entity228 and @entity229			0
brave doctor goes on the record most of the credit goes to a whistleblower who was n't afraid to speak -- and speak forcibly			1
dr. @entity235 admitted to us back in april , in his first on - camera interview , that the only reason he was coming forward so publicly was because he had finally retired , lined up all his government retirement benefits and felt the @entity40 could not retaliate at that stage			1
he had blown the whistle on the secret list months before , but no one on the inside reacted			0
a token investigation in december by the @entity245 did not end the practice of hiding veterans waiting for care			0
@entity235 had been labeled a troublemaker by the @entity251 administrators			0
and even in the middle of his very public interviews on @entity20 , a whisper campaign tried to discredit his facts and his honor			1
suddenly we were getting calls from inside @entity20 , from fellow reporters , editors and even anchors who had been contacted telling them our reporting was wrong , the numbers were off , @entity235 was a troublemaker and not to be trusted			2
it was always the same : anonymous sources who were trying to discredit @entity235 and discredit @entity20 's reporting			2
now a report has made it official : the @entity37 is investigating the great lengths allegedly taken to silence those who would expose a scandal this @entity28 had been successfully hiding for years			2
political ticker : @entity274 reaches deal on @entity40 bill were bonuses tied to @entity40 wait times ? here 's what we know			2

employees tell @entity20 they wanted to speak out about problems for a long time
they say a management campaign of intimidation and fear kept them silent
a retired doctor from the @entity40 was able to speak -- and blow the lid off the story
@entity37 is looking into allegations of reprisals against 37 people
