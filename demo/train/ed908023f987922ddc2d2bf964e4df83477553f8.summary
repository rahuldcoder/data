@entity1 star running back @entity0 learned tuesday he will be suspended without pay for the rest of the 2014 @entity5 season , according to an @entity5 statement			1
@entity0 will not be reinstated before april 15 because he violated the league 's personal conduct policy " in an incident of abusive discipline that he inflicted on his four - year - old son last may , " the league said			1
@entity0 has been on the exempt / commissioner 's permission list -- which kept him off the field , with pay -- since september after allegations he disciplined his son too harshly with a " switch " or thin stick			1
initially charged with felony child abuse , @entity0 pleaded no contest to misdemeanor reckless assault this month			1
" the timing of your potential reinstatement will be based on the results of the counseling and treatment program set forth in this decision , " @entity5 commissioner @entity26 said in a letter to @entity0			1
" under this two - step approach , the precise length of the suspension will depend on your actions			0
we are prepared to put in place a program that can help you to succeed , but no program can succeed without your genuine and continuing engagement			0
" his reinstatement also hinges on his rehabilitation , how he cares for his children and whether he commits further violations of the law or league policy , the letter stated			1
" we respect the league 's decision and will have no further comment at this time , " the @entity1 said in a statement			0
@entity59 claims ' credibility gap ' @entity0 will appeal the decision , the @entity59 said in a statement			1
the @entity59 further said the discipline imposed on @entity0 is " inconsistent " and it will " demand that a neutral arbitrator oversee the appeal			0
" the @entity5 's decision demonstrates that a " credibility gap ... exists between the agreements they make and the actions they take , " the @entity59 said			2
since @entity0 's case was adjudicated , the league has ignored its obligations and tried to impose an arbitrary form of discipline on the running back , the @entity59 said			1
" the facts are that @entity0 has asked for a meeting with @entity26 , the discipline imposed is inconsistent and an @entity5 executive told @entity0 that his time on the commissioner 's list would be considered as time served , " the statement said			1
@entity0 has not played since september 7 , when the @entity1 took on the @entity86 in the first game of the season			0
as of sunday , when the @entity1 lost to the @entity89 , @entity0 has missed nine games			0
a hearing will now be scheduled and @entity0 -- with the counsel of a lawyer and the @entity59 -- can present evidence in support of his appeal			0
he will remain on the commissioner 's exempt list until the appeal has run its course			0
aggravating circumstances according to the @entity5 , @entity26 has established a " baseline discipline " of six games without pay for first - offense assault , battery or domestic violence , but he cited aggravating circumstances in @entity0 's case : -- the child was only 4 , and while an adult can flee , fight back or call the police when experiencing abuse , those options are n't available to a child ; -- the child suffered psychological trauma stemming from the " criminal physical abuse at the hands of his father " ; -- " the repetitive use of a switch " is tantamount to a weapon in the hands of someone with the strength of a pro athlete ; -- @entity0 showed " no meaningful remorse " and publicly said he would not " eliminate whooping my kids			1
" he also sent text messages to the child 's mother defending his actions , which raises concerns that he does n't understand the seriousness of his conduct and may do it again in the future			0
though @entity0 dodged jail time with his no - contest plea , he received probation , community service and a $ 4,000 fine , but the league said it would still review the case under its personal conduct policy			2
case reviewed ; @entity0 absent the @entity5 met to review his case friday , but @entity0 did not attend , saying in a statement that he " would n't participate in a newly created and non-collectively bargained pre-discipline ' hearing ' that would include outside people i do n't know and who would have roles in the process that the @entity5 would n't disclose			2
" he did , however , attend via teleconference a monday hearing aimed at determining if he could be taken off the commissioner 's exempt list			0
the monday hearing was in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement , @entity0 said			0
the @entity5 says it requested that @entity0 provide information so it could evaluate the case under its personal conduct policy , but the player provided only " some of the court papers relating to his november 4 plea agreement			1
" the league requested the information again from the @entity59 on november 11 , but @entity0 submitted only " the name of a professional with whom @entity0 has consulted during the past two months , " the league said			0
" your plea agreement in @entity177 , and the related violation of the @entity179 , arise out of abusive injuries that you inflicted on your son earlier this year , " @entity26 said in his letter to @entity0			1
" based on public reports of your statements and photographs that were made public at the time of the indictment , you used a ' switch ' -- a flexible tree branch -- to punish your son , striking him in the ankles , limbs , back , buttocks , and genitals , leaving visible swelling , marks , and cuts on his body and risking severe and long - term damage			0
the visible injuries were such that a local pediatrician in @entity200 , upon examining your son , felt obligated to make a child abuse report to the police			1
" lesson not learned ? not only did a grand jury indict @entity0 on a felony charge because he " overstepped the bounds of acceptable corporal punishment , " @entity26 wrote , but it also " appears that this is not the first time that you have punished children in this way			1
public statements attributed to you indicate that you believe that this kind of discipline is appropriate and that you do not intend to stop disciplining your children this way			0
" in explaining his client 's behavior ahead of court proceedings , defense attorney @entity218 told media outlets that his client used a switch to dole out discipline much like @entity0 himself " experienced as a child growing up in @entity177			2
" @entity26 has directed @entity0 to meet with april @entity227 , an instructor in the @entity229 department of psychiatry and a forensic consultant to the @entity234 district attorney 's offices and @entity234 courts , by december 1 , the @entity5 said			1
@entity227 will develop a counseling and therapy program for @entity0 , according to the league statement			2
" dr. @entity227 states that two evidence - based forms of therapy have been shown to contribute to reducing the risk of future abusive behavior in child abuse cases : first , therapy that addresses parenting your children , in particular those who do not live with you , using a modality called parent - child interactive therapy ; and second , cognitive - behavioral therapy that teaches the effects of abusive behavior on children and how it traumatizes them , " the statement said			2
suspension could be longer ? @entity26 told @entity0 he will establish periodic reviews , beginning april 15 , to make sure he is meeting the program requirements and is committed to making sure nothing like this happens again			2
if @entity0 does n't cooperate or follow the plan , the suspension may be extended , @entity26 warned			2
it 's also imperative that he follow the conditions of his plea agreement and avoid any other violations of the law or the league 's personal conduct policy , the commissioner said			1
" the well - being of your children is of paramount concern , " @entity26 wrote			0
" in the absence of speaking to you to understand your current disposition toward child discipline , we can not be sure that this conduct will not be repeated			0
moreover , we are unaware of any effort on your part to acknowledge the seriousness of your conduct and your responsibility to demonstrate a genuine commitment to change			0
