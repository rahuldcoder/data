-- as bloody month after bloody month goes by , the @entity1 grows ever more committed to overthrowing the regime of @entity4 president @entity3			1
the cause is undoubtedly a just one : @entity6 , the human rights group that has been most deeply involved in the @entity8 crisis , reported thursday morning that " 17 civilians were beheaded or partially beheaded by regime security forces " outside of @entity12 , the besieged @entity12 district that will likely soon fall to @entity3 's tanks , if it has n't already			1
last week , @entity4 activists reported that regime soldiers had ambushed and killed 64 men fleeing @entity12 , dumping their bodies outside the city			2
and ousting @entity3 would bring strategic benefits , removing @entity22 's only @entity21 ally at a time when the @entity24 is on its heels , and taking out a patron of hard - line movements like @entity28 and @entity29 that oppose a two - state solution to the @entity33 - @entity32 conflict			1
but the @entity1 has not done all it can to hasten @entity3 's exit			1
@entity8 is unquestionably a hard problem -- vastly more complicated than @entity36 : more ethnically diverse , with a far greater number of outside players involved			1
@entity39 shares a long border with @entity8 and a fear of @entity43 nationalism ; @entity44 sees @entity3 as its last remaining friend in the @entity46 ; @entity47 would like to see the majority @entity48 in power ; @entity52 , @entity33 and @entity51 fear the inevitable chaos that will follow @entity3 's collapse ; and , of course , @entity22 is deeply invested in the regime 's survival			1
all this rightly makes @entity1 policymakers queasy about getting sucked into a potential quagmire just as they are pulling out of two costly wars with little to show for it			1
where advocates of military intervention see in @entity8 another @entity36 , or even a @entity66 , many see another @entity52 in the making			1
it also means the @entity1 has less leeway to pursue its interests ( and values ) unilaterally			1
as long as @entity39 , for instance , opposes safe zones along the @entity4 border , it 's a no go			2
the man responsible for the carnage in @entity8 is @entity3			1
still , the @entity80 administration has made a number of blunders that , in hindsight , have made this problem harder to solve			0
here are six : 1			0
to its credit , the administration was quick to recognize that @entity3 was in serious trouble			0
@entity80 was one of the first world leaders to call explicitly for @entity3 's ouster			0
but in doing so , was the administration too optimistic about his chances of survival , too @entity92 about the depths he would go to remain in power ? 2			0
taking force off the table			1
yes , the @entity97 is reportedly preparing " detailed " contingency options for @entity1 military action in @entity8			1
that 's what militaries do , and it 's only prudent for the @entity1 to monitor chemical weapons sites and eavesdrop on the regime 's communications			1
it 's also a good idea for the president to have a full understanding of what his options are and the risks and costs involved			1
but the administration has been unwilling to make the kind of threats that could make @entity3 think twice about what he 's doing			0
that 's understandable : it 's hard to make a threat credible if it 's obvious to all that you are n't willing to carry it out			0
but earnest denunciations and multilateral conferences do n't seem to be working			0
why undercut your diplomacy ? 3			0
the @entity1 intelligence community is concerned about the presence in @entity8 of fighters from @entity52 's @entity126 branch , who are thought to be behind a spate of bombing attacks in @entity133 and @entity134			1
that 's a reasonable worry			0
but secretary of state @entity136 went beyond caution this week , tarring the @entity4 opposition -- which is overwhelmingly ordinary @entity4 , conservative , yes , but not extremists -- with the same broad brush			0
" we know @entity126 [ leader @entity142 is supporting the opposition in @entity8			1
are we supporting @entity126 in @entity8 ? @entity28 is now supporting the opposition			1
are we supporting @entity28 in @entity8 ? " @entity145 said			1
" if you 're a military planner or if you 're a secretary of state and you 're trying to figure out do you have the elements of an opposition that is actually viable , that we do n't see			0
failing to engage @entity3 's allies			0
if @entity3 is to fall , the pillars that prop up his regime must first be removed			1
@entity22 and @entity44 , both of which continue to send weapons and advice , if not more , must be convinced that a post-al - @entity8 is something they can at least live with			2
both countries have met with members of the @entity4 opposition , indicating they want to explore their options			2
perhaps these are merely insincere efforts to help @entity3 divide and conquer			0
but it 's worth exploring what 's real and what 's not			0
the same goes for @entity3 's internal allies : are we doing enough to convince senior military and security leaders that they 're better off without @entity3 ? 5			0
even if you believe the @entity44 will never dump @entity3 , what about the @entity169 ? @entity169 also vetoed the most recent @entity173 resolution on @entity8 , in tune with its habit of standing with @entity44 against encroachment on the principle of state sovereignty			2
but @entity179 has made little effort to engage @entity181 on this issue , or to enlist @entity21 oil suppliers like @entity47 to lobby on the @entity4 opposition 's behalf			0
@entity169 has few tangible interests in @entity8 , and might be convinced that a post-al - @entity3 world is in its broader interest			2
that would leave @entity44 isolated and uncomfortable			0
focusing exclusively on the @entity190			0
underscoring its skittishness about the growing militarization of what is by now a civil war by any reasonable definition , the @entity80 administration has shied away from dealing with the @entity198 's leadership in @entity39			0
perhaps more is going on behind the scenes , but the @entity1 has clearly put its energies behind the @entity190			2
but it is unclear whether this fractious body of exiles truly represents @entity4 on the ground , and its relationship with the @entity198 is poor			0
the @entity190 on thursday announced it was setting up some kind of " military bureau " to funnel weapons to the @entity198 , but it 's not yet clear the @entity198 is truly on board			0
the @entity190 has also had a hard time attracting support from minorities , who fear that @entity3 's ouster will put their communities at risk			2
these points are not an indictment of @entity80 's @entity8 policy			2
there are no good options here , only bad and worse ones			1
as @entity3 moves to consolidate his brutal victory in @entity12 and put the rebellion down once and for all , there 's still time to rectify our mistakes and shape an outcome that saves lives and protects @entity1 interests			1
but not very much time			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity232			2

@entity232 says @entity234 is likely to fall as @entity8 regime continues brutal *crackdown*
he says @entity1 committed to ousting regime but has not gone all in to end complex conflict
he lists 6 ways the @entity1 *faltered* , *including* taking force off the table ; worrying about @entity126
@entity232 : there are no good options , only bad and worse ; time running short to save lives
