-- time - lapse videos are usually a stationary affair , shot from a fixed location and angle over an extended period of time			1
but now , @entity7 is letting @entity9 users ditch the tripods and take time - lapse videos on the go with its new app , @entity14			1
the key feature of the free app , released tuesday , is a stabilization engine that takes advantage of the @entity9 's built - in gyroscope to keep images from shaking			1
without the jiggling , @entity14 users are free to move around			0
take @entity14 for a walk or a bike ride and explore your surroundings			0
strap your phone to a quadcopter , hold it out the car window , or if you 're feeling old - school , just leave it one spot to watch the world go by			0
unlike @entity7 , @entity14 is more a tool for creating videos than a social sharing app. you do n't need to log in with an @entity7 or @entity38 account to use @entity14 , but there is an option to post clips to the two social networks when you 're done			1
there are n't filters in the @entity14 app , but they can be added through @entity7 ( although the videos will still need to be cut down to 15 seconds )			1
though the videos look professional , the interface is dead simple			0
open the app , tap to focus , and start recording			0
once you 're done , a slider lets you speed up the video as much as 12 times			0
@entity14 videos can run up to 45 minutes on the @entity9 , 10 minutes on the @entity55			1
this is only @entity7 's second stand - alone app. in july , it released @entity59 , a self - destructing photo and video messaging app that is only available in a few countries			2
@entity7 added a 15 - second video function a year ago , a direct challenge to @entity66 's vine feature			2
@entity7 's parent company @entity38 has been more aggressive with pushing out stand - alone apps , including the recent controversial move to spin off messaging			2
@entity14 is only available on the @entity9			2
the company says limitations in @entity74 's api will keep it off that platform for the time being .			0

@entity14 is a new @entity9 app from @entity7 for creating time - lapse videos
it uses the @entity9 's gyroscope to stabilize videos
@entity14 videos can be shot while moving
you do not need an @entity7 or @entity38 account to use the app
