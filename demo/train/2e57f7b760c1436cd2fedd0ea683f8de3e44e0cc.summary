let 's start with a touch of perspective			0
it 's not only @entity4 where sexual minorities suffer discrimination			1
in the @entity10 , that beacon of tolerance , there 's still a huge amount of bigotry			2
some @entity10 states still refuse to recognize same - sex marriage			1
and hate crimes and violence towards @entity18 individuals remain a significant problem			2
@entity4 does not have a monopoly on intolerance			0
however , there is a key difference			0
in the @entity10 , officials go to great lengths to espouse tolerant views and behavior			0
laws have been passed , and are enforced , protecting lgbt rights			0
in @entity4 , that is rarely the case			0
that 's not just my view , it 's the opinion of @entity37 , a @entity38 - based rights group			1
in their latest report on @entity4 , titled license to @entity40 , @entity37 finds the @entity4 authorities have not only " failed in their obligation to prevent and prosecute homophobic violence , " but have also " effectively legalized discrimination against @entity18 people and cast them as second class citizens			1
" the controversial measure the report singles out is , of course , @entity4 's " anti-gay propaganda " legislation			1
the law bans " propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations among minors " and was , according to @entity37 , one of several @entity57 measures adopted or proposed in 2013			2
in their report , @entity37 says the law does n't actually protect anyone , but does give homophobes a reason to believe @entity18 lives matter less to the @entity4 government			1
the report goes on to document various horrific instances of violence and abuse against @entity4 's @entity18 community , including by radical nationalist groups luring gay men on the pretext of a fake date			1
during the @entity79 , homosexuality was a crime punishable by prison and hard labor			0
homosexuals were regarded as pedophiles or fascists , outside normal society			0
laws explicitly banning homosexuality were lifted in 1993 , after the @entity79 collapse -- though there was no amnesty for those jailed for sodomy -- but the attitude appears to have stuck			0
even today , @entity18 activists in @entity4 -- like the couple i met in @entity98 recently -- are regarded as outsiders , sometimes agents of the @entity100 , to be distrusted			2
the @entity98 lawmaker behind the controversial " propaganda " law , @entity103 , underlined this when he told me that any @entity4 who want a same - sex marriage should move to the @entity107 " where they belong			1
" that 's a potent connection in these times of growing tensions between @entity4 and the @entity107			0
linking @entity4 's @entity18 community with the enemy taps into old fears of corrupt outsiders polluting @entity4 purity , and bodes extremely badly for hopes that discrimination in @entity4 will be tackled .			1
