-- the statistics are devastating , but for aid workers like @entity3 and @entity4 , witnessing the despair from the @entity7 flooding was far more tragic than they imagined			1
" you can see 8,000 to 10,000 people in @entity11 in the road , sleeping in the mud , " said @entity3 , a resident of @entity8			1

" roughly 4 million people are homeless from mammoth flooding that covered much of @entity7 for three weeks			1
hundreds of health facilities are damaged or destroyed			1
millions are at risk for deadly waterborne diseases from the filthy flood waters			2
officials estimate the death toll between 1,500 and 1,600 , but @entity3 says he thinks the numbers could skyrocket as water recedes and more bodies and animals surface			1
" everywhere we go we see eight to 10 feet of water , " said @entity3 , who traveled through inundated villages between @entity35 and @entity11			2
" all we see are the tops of houses			2
" just a month ago , @entity3 was a recreational rider in the @entity39 of @entity8			2
he did n't expect to use his off - roading skills to deliver life - saving supplies to flood victims across nearly impassible terrain and waters			2
" we never thought of that , " @entity3 said			0
" but when you see things happen like this , you ca n't just sit on the side and watch thousands of people die			1
" so club members , family and friends raised money for supplies to the neediest survivors			0
so far the @entity39 of @entity8 has distributed 100 tents and about eight truckloads of food			0
in @entity11 , where refugees are arriving en masse , the riders have distributed at least 400 hampers of food			0
each hamper contains 5 kilograms of flour , 5 kilograms of rice , a liter of oil , salt , tea and water			0
but the work has n't been easy			0
the stench of filth permeates the air			0
skin blisters surface from temperatures reaching 48 degrees @entity79 ( 118 degrees @entity80 )			0
@entity3 said he ca n't shake the image in his mind of young children chasing him as he tossed water from a moving truck			0
the truck was moving at least 30 kilometers per hour , but he could n't slow down			0
mobs of hundreds have pounced on aid workers delivering food or water			1
" it somehow gives the impression that these are greedy people , " @entity4 said			1
" but it 's not greed			1
" hundreds of thousands of @entity7 have acquired transmittable ailments such as acute watery diarrhea , scabies and respiratory infections			1

" i think a few weeks ... that 's when the diseases will get worse			1
" prime minister @entity103 has called a tuesday meeting of local and national health officials as well as @entity107 agencies and other international groups to address the mounting health crisis			1
the @entity107 says it still needs about $ 200 million for aid			0
@entity3 said he wonders why some are n't donating as much to @entity7 flood relief as they have to previous natural disasters , such as the @entity115 earthquake in january			1
" maybe it 's donor fatigue , " he said			2
" but that 's no excuse			2
" despite the heat , filth , disease and destruction , @entity4 said he had no regrets about his decision to help			0
" we could have stayed home and watched this happen on tv , " he said			0
" but someone has to take the next step			0
