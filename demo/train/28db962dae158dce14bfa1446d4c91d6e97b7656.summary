the @entity1 writer @entity0 once said an excellent puzzle would be to try to cross @entity4 without walking past a pub. a similar challenge for many cities in the @entity8 would be to drive more than 20 miles on surface streets without hearing your wheels thrum over a perpendicular rail crossing			1
trains and cars must share an uneasy co-existence here in the nation that railroads built , and for many drivers -- especially those who live near active tracks -- the act of crossing them also comes with a brief pause , perhaps mindful of the 3,000 tons of angry steel that could theoretically be barreling toward them			2
the horrendous possibility became a reality in the town of @entity30 , @entity31 , on wednesday evening when a @entity33 train slammed into an suv that apparently got stuck on the tracks after a crossing bar dropped down on it			1
the driver , who apparently had gotten out of her car to investigate , was killed in the crash along with five passengers on the train			1
fatalities such as these are not an aberration			2
an average of about five people each week are killed in train collisions , far more than those who lose their lives in commercial airline crashes			1
the exact cause of the @entity30 gate - lowering wo n't be known until the @entity50 finishes its investigation			1
but the nation 's big railroads usually take the position that careless motorists or daredevils trying to beat the lowering gates are always the cause of the problem			0
evidence indicates , however , that the victims are sometimes not at fault because the gates are malfunctioning or the lights are broken			0
state and local governments are responsible for keeping crossings safe and equipment up to date , but railroads can be complicit in allowing conditions to deteriorate to dangerous levels			0
vegetation sometimes grows around signs without being trimmed , for example			0
a 2004 investigative series from the @entity76 found a persistent pattern of railroad cover - ups in cases of fatal crashes			2
in some cases , records were destroyed and malfunctioning gates were quickly fixed before lawyers could examine the evidence			0
five years later , the freight railroad network @entity87 was fined $ 4 million by a judge for its " staggering " and " egregious " conduct in a lawsuit involving the deaths of four people struck by a train at a crossing with a broken gate			1
the railroad " knowingly advanced lies , misleading facts and / or misrepresentations " in the legal proceedings , judge @entity96 wrote			2
short of running it underground or up on viaducts , there is no way to run a railroad across open land in the @entity8 without crossing multiple surface streets and country lanes , putting the unwary at risk of being flattened by oncoming trains			1
the " bells and bars " safety system designed to prevent this horror emerged in fits and starts through the last 180 years , and there are no current movements to replace it with anything else			1
the early railroaders of the 1830s got around this problem by posting guards at major crossings and instructing them to keep people away with force when a train was on the way			1
the first hand - cranked gate was patented in 1867			0
automatic flashing warning lights were introduced in 1913 , and the familiar @entity134 sign known as a " crossbuck " became ubiquitous through the nation			0
the striped bar called a " boom barrier " that automatically descends across the tracks used to cover two whole lanes of traffic , but it was eventually shortened to one lane to allow motorists trapped inside to find a way to maneuver out before the train plowed into them			0
that appears to have been what the @entity30 driver was attempting to do when she was struck			1
better driver education and the painfully slow attempts by railroads and states to upgrade faulty crossing equipment have shown results over the last four decades			0
total car - versus - train collisions are down from about 12,000 in 1972 to just over 2,000 in 2013			0
but it does not change the fact that most @entity8 cities are seeded with permanent killing zones that can trap inattentive drivers .			2

@entity33 crash killed six people at railroad crossing in @entity30 , @entity31
overall , train fatalities down in @entity8 , @entity168 says
but " bells and bars " system still relies mainly on caution , proper gate maintenance , he says
