@entity0 -- @entity3 traffic will inevitably have gridlocks nationwide , and for the tony @entity6 area in @entity7 , access by car and bus will be no different			1
so why not take to the skies in an @entity12 ? @entity13 , a service that dispatches cars for hire using mobile apps , is offering on - demand helicopters from @entity19 to @entity20			1
the @entity22 - based car service announced tuesday via e-mail and blog that it will branch into helicopters , offering to whisk wealthy clients from the throngs of @entity28 to the relative calm of the @entity6			1
the service begins at midday wednesday			1
how does it work ? @entity12 will be added to the @entity13 transportation options on the company 's mobile app. a car and driver pick up the client , who is driven directly to a helipad			1
users can select from one of three helipads in @entity19 -- on the east and west sides and the @entity43			1
because of the steep price tag -- $ 3,000 for a one - way trip -- uber staff calls clients to verify that they intended to call the chopper			1
then up to six people can pile into the helicopter for a mere 40 - minute ride to the @entity52			2
upon arrival , a second @entity13 - serviced suv will drive clients to their final destination			1
" it 's a lot better than the three to four hours it can take [ to drive ] on a busy weekend , " says @entity56 , general manager of @entity57			0
" this is modeled like our car service			0
we do n't own the cars , we just partner with drivers			0
" for the @entity0 helicopters , @entity13 paired with @entity68 , a private company with several dozen choppers in the area			1
" we have a logistics fabric that we use in the cities that we operate in			0
this is an experiment in extending that , " @entity56 added			0
he says the idea began as a joke around the @entity78 offices , which are known to throw a barbecue and ice cream truck into their mix of available services			0
but the idea morphed into reality for the summer rush to the @entity6			0
the concept of such flights to the @entity6 is not new			0
in 2012 , hotelier @entity89 introduced @entity90 , an amphibious aircraft that leaves from the @entity92 on a 45 - minute flight to the @entity52			2
one - way tickets cost a cool $ 525			2
unlike @entity90 , however , @entity13 is available almost instantaneously , @entity56 says			2
" this is similar to a charter , but the magic here is that you 're pushing a button when you 're ready to go			0
" though the service just began wednesday and flights are not booked far in advance , @entity56 says he expects full flights , judging by the media buzz and feedback from clients			2
since it launched in may 2010 in @entity22 , @entity13 has blossomed from a small technology start - up into a major private automobile presence in 33 cities with drivers around the world			1
now add pilots to that list , too .			0

@entity13 , a service that dispatches cars for hire using mobile apps , adds on - demand helicopters
the service was launched wednesday
it offers a flight from @entity19 to @entity20 , @entity0
three helipads are available in @entity19 , and a one - way trip costs $ 3,000
