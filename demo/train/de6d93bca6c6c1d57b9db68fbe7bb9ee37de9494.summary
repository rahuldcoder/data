@entity0 -- it was a heart - wrenching memorial for victims of the @entity6 killings			1
the fact that three of them were just young children , shot in cold blood , added to the feelings of loss and despair			2
on the outskirts of @entity0 , at the main @entity16 cemetery , ambulances delivered the coffins , as thousands came to pay their respects			1
" in @entity6 and @entity0 , in @entity26 and @entity27 , @entity25 are standing together , " the speaker of the @entity23 parliament , @entity21 , told the mourners			1
" the house of @entity23 weeps at these murders , " he added			1
the atmosphere was acutely sad and subdued , with painful moments of intense grief			0
one came when the mother of a murdered toddler arrived to bid farewell to her child			0
too distraught to walk , she was carried from the ambulance by the crowd			0
the teenaged brother of seven - year - old @entity41 -- the little girl shot at point blank range by the gunman -- captured the distress of the tragedy			0
" @entity41 , i have a last request , never stop crying and pray to god to give us strength to continue and give strength for our parents to overcome this most terrible time			0
" and as a sign of how serious the @entity58 government is taking this attack , the country 's foreign minister , @entity54 , also made an address , vowing to protect @entity58 jews from attack			1
" do n't have any doubts about our steadfast ability to fight anti @entity67 , " he told the crowd			0
" every time a jew is cursed , attacked or killed , the whole nation is in the crosshairs and has to react immediately			0
" many @entity23 , though , may not be convinced by that			2
@entity58 is often identified here as a place where the @entity25 community is vunerable , and there is alarm at what is seen in @entity23 as a rising tide of @entity78 across @entity79			1
" the jews of @entity79 are once again in grave danger , " comments one opinion piece on the popular @entity82 website			0
the article predicts an upsurge in the number of @entity25 abandoning @entity79 for @entity23 , calling it a " tragic but unavoidable process : the @entity79 will be a @entity25 - free continent			2
" that may be alarmist , but the dreadful killings in @entity6 , the standoff , and the emotional burials in @entity0 , have reopened a sensitive debate .			1
