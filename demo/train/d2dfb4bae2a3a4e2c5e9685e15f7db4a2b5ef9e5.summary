@entity0 -- a single leaked document has opened a political @entity3 over intelligence - gathering in the post 9/11 @entity5 , raising questions about what is being done and how the public perceives it almost 12 years after the terrorist attacks that traumatized the nation			1
this week 's disclosure of classified government programs to collect information on phone calls , e-mails and internet use for national security reasons quickly dominated headlines , forcing president @entity21 to reassure @entity5 on friday that " nobody is listening to your telephone calls			1
" his first public comments on the secret programs revealed by the @entity27 and @entity28 touched on a litany of politically volatile issues that have come to shape the @entity21 presidency early in its second term			1
in particular , the president who campaigned in 2007 by criticizing what he called his predecessor 's claim of a " false choice " between civil liberties and national security following the september 11 , 2001 , @entity42 attacks now argues that such a choice was inevitable			1
" you ca n't have 100 % security and also then have 100 % privacy and zero inconvenience , " @entity21 said			1
" we 're going to have to make some choices as a society			0
" the swing in perspective reflects how the @entity5 has changed since 9/11 , when the attacks on @entity54 and @entity0 that killed almost 3,000 people traumatized a nation where many believed global terror could n't threaten the homeland			2
how does it affect me ? ensuing security efforts by president @entity63 's administration included the wars in @entity65 and @entity66 as well as tougher policies such as torturing suspects			1
in the anti-terrorism fervor of the nation , @entity69 easily passed the @entity72 sought by the @entity63 administration in 2001 to expand domestic spying despite opposition by civil liberties groups			1
some provisions of the @entity72 were ruled unconstitutional and @entity69 reauthorized a modified version five years later			2
@entity21 , then a first - term senator from @entity80 , voted for the revised measure after taking part in mostly unsuccessful efforts to further strengthen civil liberties provisions			1
as president in 2011 , @entity21 signed another reauthorization of some @entity72 provisions that allow the clandestine operations made public this week			1
on friday , the president argued that while classified , the programs were known to @entity69 and contained effective oversight from legislators and federal courts			2
he rejected criticism from both the far left and far right of the political spectrum that the data mining of phone records and monitoring of foreign e-mail and internet use overstepped constitutional bounds , but welcomed renewed public debate on the shadowy issue			2
damage assessment over @entity5 intelligence - gathering leaks " in the abstract , you can complain about @entity108 or how this is a potential program run amok , but when you actually look at the details , then i think we 've struck the right balance , " @entity21 concluded			1
leaders of intelligence committees in the @entity115 and @entity116 have publicly backed the secret programs , saying they helped authorities prevent terrorist attacks			1
others in @entity69 argued the secret information - gathering goes too far			2
" i think that we 've overreached , " sen. @entity122 , a @entity124 @entity123 who has long pushed for greater transparency in the government 's counter-terror efforts , told @entity1			2
" i think that we ought to have this discussion and we can find the right balance			0
but if the people do n't know , how do you have the discussion ? " @entity133 , deputy legal director of the @entity134 , also said people have to know what liberties are at stake before they can effectively debate whether the government programs are right or wrong			2
privacy 's already dead " at some point we have to ask that question , what are you willing to give up ? " @entity133 told @entity1			0
" before you ask it , you have to have some information about what is being given up			0
too much of it is secret			0
" a leaked court order published by the @entity27 on wednesday shed the first light on the extent of the government monitoring of information			0
subsequent revelations confirmed by the government disclosed @entity5 intelligence agencies are collecting details on telephone calls and monitoring the online activities of at least some overseas customers of @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 and other providers of popular online services			1
@entity122 and fellow @entity167 sen. @entity166 of @entity168 warned last year that the @entity5 public " would be stunned to learn the details " of how the government was interpreting the @entity72			1
" as we see it , there is now a significant gap between what most @entity5 think the law allows and what the government secretly claims the law allows , " they wrote in a letter to attorney general @entity173			1
to @entity183 , vice president and director of governance studies at the @entity185 , the issue touches on shifts in the terrorism threat as well as how to protect against it			2
a rise in homegrown terrorism and the corresponding need to look internally for possible threats is " how post 9/11 @entity5 has changed , " @entity183 told @entity1 on friday			1
in the aftermath of the 9/11attacks , " people favored the @entity72 because it was going to be directed against terrorists , " he said			0
" it used to be us versus them , but those distinctions have broken down			0
if you want to target terrorists , there are going to be some @entity5 in that category			0
" to handle what he called a " horrible communications challenge " in response to the firestorm created by this week 's revelations , @entity183 said the @entity21 administration needs to explain the difference between outright spying such as listening in on phone calls and the more general data mining of the newly disclosed programs			1
" basically everyone 's doing that these days , both in government and business , " he said of data mining , which essentially is how @entity219 tailors advertisements to specific patterns of activity by its members			2
however , a lack of clarity in rules and regulations under the @entity72 magnifies the problem , according to @entity183			0
for example , he noted that that overseas phone calls from the @entity5 can be subject to greater scrutiny than domestic calls			0
@entity236 laughs about being spied on " it 's actually easy for people to be paranoid , because in some cases there are greater protections , but in other areas there are fewer or no protections , " @entity183 said			0
another change has been the revolution in social media on the @entity236 , with people now able to communicate around the world instantly and for free			0
@entity250 , a political science professor at @entity252 , said the technology advance means a younger generation that is much more experienced and comfortable with publicly sharing details of their lives and also more aware of the threat of terrorism			0
" they 've lived their whole lives on the @entity236 ; everything they are is public , " @entity250 told @entity1 on friday			0
at the same time , she said , " growing up with sort of the threat of random terrorism has created a nation that is more frightened than it used to be and more willing to let the government do what it needs to go to keep them safe			0
" as a result , @entity250 said , the @entity21 administration has to demonstrate it will follow the law in using information collected in order to generate public support for letting it have that information			0
" when it fails , people are less willing to allow you to invade their privacy , " she said			0
for that reason , this week 's disclosures pose a problem for @entity21 at a time when the @entity287 has been cited for targeting conservative groups seeking tax - exempt status for extra scrutiny			1
opinion : the great privacy debate @entity294 opponents seeking to depict a government gone wild lump together the @entity287 controversy , the @entity299 's secret subpoenas for journalist phone records and the newly revealed classified programs to attack the president			1
" this is an all - out assault on the @entity308 , " @entity294 sen. @entity303 of @entity304 said friday in a statement that noted @entity21 formerly fought to protect civil liberties when he was in the @entity116			1
to @entity250 , @entity21 's adoption of much of the @entity63 - era anti-terrorism apparatus was the natural outcome from assuming presidential responsibility for national security			1
" nobody predicted in 2007 that @entity21 would preside over such a massive spying operation , " she said			0
" you never know until you get in there how many threats are out there against the @entity5 and what you have to do is thwart them			0
" it all comes down to being the commander in chief , she said , adding : " i do n't think there 's a president who ever served who would not have done the same thing in the name of security			2
" opinion : where 's the evidence that data mining saves lives ? @entity1 's @entity335 contributed to this report .			0

president @entity21 defends secret programs in the face of questions , criticism
@entity21 's adoption of @entity63 - era security programs is a shift from his @entity116 days
*analyst* : *increased* homegrown terrorism changes @entity5 views of the @entity72
critics say debating the issue requires more details of what the government is doing
