a potentially deadly strain of the flu virus			0
the @entity6 public trusts the @entity7 to handle dangerous biological materials , but recent incidents have put a damper on the agency 's reputation , members of @entity4 said wednesday			1
" what happened was completely unacceptable , " @entity7 director dr. @entity13 said in his testimony before the @entity16 's subcommittee for @entity17			1
" it never should have happened			0
" rep. @entity20 , @entity21 , the subcommittee chairman , opened the hearing by summarizing the troubling incidents that have come to light over the past month			2
in early june , dozens of @entity7 workers were potentially exposed to anthrax after a lab failed to inactivate the dangerous bacteria before transferring it to a lower lab. a subsequent investigation revealed " an alarming series of failures , " according to one of the subcommittee members , including an incident of cross contamination between a relatively safe and a potentially deadly strain of the flu virus			1
an outside investigation by the @entity6 @entity41 found dangerous biological materials stored in unlocked refrigerators and a general lack of lab workers following safety protocols			0
investigators say the anthrax that was believed to be deactivated was transferred in @entity50 bags , which are obviously not approved to carry such materials			0
" this is troubling , and it is completely unacceptable , " @entity20 said			0
" the @entity7 is supposed to be the gold standard ( for lab safety )			2
... this is not sound science , and this will not be tolerated			0
these practices put the health of the @entity6 public at risk			0
" @entity20 said the @entity7 was lucky that no one appears to have been infected during the anthrax incident , but " sooner or later that luck will run out			1
" this is not the first time the subcommittee has heard of safety issues at @entity7 labs , said rep. @entity71 , @entity72			1
multiple hearings over the past decade have shown lapses that together reveal a problem with safety reporting at the agency , she said			0
" what we all need to know is the plan to change the culture at the @entity7 , " @entity71 said			1
" we can do a lot but we ca n't legislate a culture change			2
" @entity13 , who took the @entity7 director job in 2009 , acknowledged that he and other @entity7 managers failed to recognize a " critical pattern			1
" the @entity7 has closed the labs that were involved in the incidents			1
they wo n't reopen until better safety procedures are in place , @entity13 said			2
scientists have also stopped moving any biological material out of its two highest - level labs while their procedures are being re-evaluated			0
this may slow some @entity7 processes -- such as providing materials for companies to create next year 's flu vaccine , @entity13 said -- but safety comes first			1
" we must do that work more safely , and we will , " he said .			0
