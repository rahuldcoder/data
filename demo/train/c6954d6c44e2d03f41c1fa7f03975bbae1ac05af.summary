@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 @entity3 used the latest potential @entity6 case -- this time , a doctor in @entity8 -- to blast president @entity10 's handling of the virus outbreak in a debate against @entity1 @entity14 sen. @entity13 thursday night			1
it was a local debate that turned on national issues as @entity3 called for a ban on travel from the @entity20 epicenter of the outbreak and defended his suggestion that @entity6 could come across the border with @entity24			1
he blasted @entity10 's appointment of @entity26 as the nation 's @entity6 response coordinator as someone " with no experience in his field			2
" he criticized @entity13 for not voting to close the @entity34 border with @entity24			2
and he complained that the @entity8 doctor should have been quarantined when he returned to the @entity34			0
@entity3 even said the @entity6 threat would be minimized if @entity4 @entity36 had been elected president			1
" had he been president , i feel he would have had a clear and concise plan			0
he would have reassured the @entity34 people , " @entity3 said			2
@entity13 , meanwhile , criticized @entity3 for " fear - mongering about this issue , " and said neither she nor @entity3 have medical expertise on the issue			1
but @entity3 shot back that " she calls it fear - mongering ; i call it rational fear			1
" the exchange -- in a debate being moderated by @entity2 's @entity49 and held at the @entity51 studios in @entity1 's capital city of @entity0 -- was the latest demonstration of @entity3 's effort to nationalize the race -- connecting @entity13 to @entity10 and national @entity14 and accusing them of wobbly responses to threats that have emerged this summer and fall			1
@entity3 has focused his campaign on national issues , also blasting president @entity10 for his handling of @entity62 , illegal immigration and a host of other issues -- then latching @entity13 to @entity10 by pointing to her votes for his initiatives			1
@entity13 , meanwhile , has questioned the former @entity70 senator 's move into @entity1 , casting him as a political opportunist and accusing him of being vague on his support for abortion rights , equal pay for women and more			1
the two have both dodged answers about whether they would support their parties ' leaders -- democrat @entity81 and @entity4 @entity82 -- for majority leader			0
entering thursday night 's debate , the race was a dead heat			0
a new @entity2 / @entity88 poll found @entity13 with 49 percent support to @entity3 's 47 percent -- well inside its margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points			1
@entity3 's favorability rating was underwater , with 50 percent of the likely voters surveyed saying they have unfavorable views of him versus 48 percent saying their views are favorable			0
@entity13 , meanwhile , scored a 52 percent favorability rating			0
however , the race could turn on whether @entity13 is able to keep on her side voters who have turned on @entity10			0
his approval rating dropped to 39 percent in @entity1 -- which has driven @entity3 's efforts to connect @entity13 with the president			1

@entity117 , a 64 - year - old environmental lawyer from @entity118 who stopped by to pick up a @entity120 sign before the debate , said some voters are turned off by @entity3 's approach			2
" i think you can talk about the national issues all you want			0
people get that @entity3 is just using us for a national stage , " she said			0
she pointed to @entity13 's support for equal pay and access to health care as issues that will help drive @entity14 - leaning voters to the polls , and praised @entity13 's deep political ties to @entity1 , including her three two - year terms as governor			2
" we who have lived here for a long time -- and i 've lived here since 1976 -- know what she 's done , " she said in a veiled shot at @entity3 , the former @entity70 senator			0
@entity3 supporters said he has more than enough connections to the state			0
" i think anybody that was born in this state has every state to run for @entity154 in the state that they were born in , " said @entity147 , a 59 - year - old mechanical engineer from @entity148 who said he had crossed into @entity70 in 2010 to volunteer for @entity3 's campaign there			0
he said the " biggest issue " in the race is that @entity13 has backed @entity10 's policies in the vast majority of her @entity154 votes , calling her " carte blanche for the president			2

@entity6 was the first issue as candidates *squared* off at a @entity2 / @entity51 debate in @entity1

sen. @entity13 accused him of " *fearmongering* "
