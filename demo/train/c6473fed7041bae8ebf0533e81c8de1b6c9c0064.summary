@entity0 -- in @entity0 , most speeches by representatives of other countries are , well , diplomatic , carefully written to avoid controversy			0
a speech by @entity8 president @entity7 at the @entity9 on wednesday broke that mold			1
speaking off - the - cuff for much of it , @entity7 gave a frank and , at times , sarcastic evaluation of @entity16 - @entity8 relations			1
citing @entity18 disclosures of @entity20 cables , which some @entity8 officials believe show the @entity16 put relations with @entity23 ahead of @entity8 's security interests , @entity7 said : " like in marriage -- from time to time its worth taking your wife for a date			1
" translation : the @entity16 should not take @entity8 for granted			1
" it 's like a mantra that 's mumbled , some slogans are specifically repeated , and quite often there is no practice behind them , " the @entity8 president said			1
" today i spoke with president @entity38 about it			0
perhaps i used slightly different words but i want to repeat the same : i simply believe that very much has gone the wrong way in @entity8 - @entity16 relations			1
and this can be testified to by leaks from different @entity16 cables			2
" @entity7 also complained about the requirement that he submit visa form to visit the @entity16			1
referring to 18th century @entity8 heroes of the @entity49 , he said : " @entity50 and @entity51 today would also have to fill in the visa forms if they wanted to come to the @entity16			2
" @entity7 said , when he filled in his @entity16 visa form , he was asked " whether i am involved in prostitution or if perhaps i was involved in genocide or whether i was a terrorist			1
" " well , i do n't take it as an insult , " the @entity8 president added			2
" i 'm not a prostitute			0
but i have to tell you when i had to answer the question whether i was a terrorist my hand shook a little			0
because i do not want to lie			0
i do not want to lie to the @entity16			2
" but i had some doubt			0
at the time of the @entity66 regime i was considered to be a terrorist			0
it was the language of some of the charges formulated by the prosecutor in the communist state			0
so i did not know : should i write the truth or lie in that form ? so my suggestion is to skip that form			0
... it 's not understandable for us			0
it spoils a lot in @entity8 - @entity16 relations			1
