facial surgery that targets and removes small portions of migraine - triggering muscle or nerve tissue may offer permanent relief for some people with the debilitating headaches , a new study suggests			1
more than 30 million @entity8 experience migraine headaches			2
" other migraine treatments either temporarily prevent the symptoms or they may reduce the symptoms after the migraine headaches start , " says @entity10 , @entity11 , a professor and the chair of the department of plastic surgery at the @entity15 and @entity16			1
" what we are offering is essentially a cure			0
" in a study published in @entity25 , @entity26 and colleagues looked for people who had migraines that started in a specific region on the front , side , or back of the head			2
the researchers injected @entity36 into these trigger points to temporarily paralyze the muscle ; if the injections helped relieve the migraines , the patients were randomly divided into two surgical groups			1
after the @entity36 wore off , one group had a face - lifting surgery combined with the removal of muscle tissue or nerves in the area that triggered the migraines			1
fat or muscle was used to fill in the area after tissue was removed			0
@entity54 : quiz -- surprising migraine causes and cures the second group had a sham procedure , in which incisions were made but all muscles and nerves remained intact			2
a total of 75 patients were involved in the study			2
in the year after the procedure , 57 percent of those who had the actual surgery reported the complete elimination of migraine headaches , compared with just 4 percent in the sham surgery group			1
in addition , 84 percent of those who had the surgery reported at least a 50 percent reduction in migraine pain compared with just 58 percent in the sham group			1

more than 30 million @entity8 experience migraine headaches			0
however , @entity92 , @entity11 , a consultant at the department of neurology at the @entity95 , says this surgery probably wo n't become a common procedure , despite the results			0
@entity54 : knowing your mother 's health history can lower your risks " this may be a technique that will help a small number of migraine patients who have responded to @entity36 , but it 's certainly not a procedure for generally treating migraines , " says @entity92 , who was not involved in the new study			1
he points out that people who had the sham surgery probably suspected that they were in the placebo group , since the face - lift would most likely have reduced wrinkling			1
if a treatment is n't completely blinded , it can skew a study 's results ; if patients suspect they 've had a sham treatment , they may be less likely to say their migraines are cured			1
however , nearly 60 percent of the people who had the sham procedure reported some migraine relief too			1
@entity10 believes this could be related to a placebo effect , or the incisions could have disturbed some of the nerve branches and actually relieved migraines in some way			0
@entity54 : 20 little ways to drop the pounds and keep them off overall , there was a 92 percent success rate , notes @entity10			0
" this study offers powerful evidence to the plastic surgeon , the neurologist , and the insurance companies that this operation is effective , " he says			0
