editor 's note : @entity3 contributor @entity2 is a bestselling author whose new book is " @entity5 : a @entity6			1
" @entity2 says television 's first anchorman took his replacement by @entity10 with grace			1
( @entity3 ) -- if you are a person whose life has been a series of constant triumphs , accompanied by the sound of unending cheers -- a life like that of , say , @entity10 -- then this story is not for you			1
but if your life has had its share of disappointments and setbacks , you may be interested in the tale of a man by the name of @entity29			1
for some of you , the name may be vaguely familiar			2
for most of you , it probably means nothing			2
@entity29 was the anchorman of @entity37 ' evening news broadcasts for 14 years			1
he was , in fact , network television 's first anchorman ; his broadcast -- " @entity29 with the @entity41 , " it was called -- first aired at the dinner hour on @entity37 in 1948 , and continued until 1962 , when @entity29 was told he was being replaced by @entity10			1
for those 14 years , during the so - called @entity45 , @entity29 ' face was the face of @entity41			1
and @entity37 was the most prestigious of the three national networks			2
so what happened to him ? @entity49 and @entity50 happened to him			0
@entity55 's " @entity54 " became wildly popular with the public ; it was clobbering @entity29 in the ratings			1
@entity37 decided that it had to make a move			0
such decisions are common in television , and in the wider world of business			2
what is uncommon -- what is a valuable lesson in grace and dignity -- is how @entity65 dealt with his demotion			2
i sought him out in the early 1980s			0
more than 18 years had passed since he had been pushed aside			0
he was still an employee of @entity37			0
his job was to deliver a one - minute television " newsbreak " each mid-morning			2
he also was assigned to three brief radio reports a day			0
he was as polite a man as i have ever met ; we ended up keeping in touch over the years ( he died at age 73 in 1990 )			0
whatever bitterness he may have felt about losing the job he cherished , whatever anger he may have harbored toward the people who took it away from him , he chose to keep to himself			0
he had the same middle - of - the - country upbringing that @entity10 did ; @entity29 was born in @entity84 , @entity85 , and moved as a teenager with his family to @entity88			1
his journalistic credentials were impeccable ; he worked with @entity90 on @entity93 's storied @entity92 staff toward the end of @entity95 , and his interview subjects included @entity97 and @entity98			2
his on - scene reporting of the sinking of the @entity102 liner @entity103 in 1956 received widespread praise , and he was the recipient of a @entity105 for his television work			2
he told me that after his demotion , he and @entity10 continued to run into each other in the hallways of @entity37			1
@entity10 had become an @entity112 institution			1
@entity29 told me there was no awkwardness , that the two of them liked and respected each other			1
@entity10 , in his autobiography , confirmed this			1
he wrote that on a friday in 1962 , a @entity37 executive told him that he would be taking over the anchor chair on monday			0
@entity29 ' fall was just that abrupt			1
@entity10 wrote : " i was advised that @entity65 had just been told			1
i went straight to his office to try to assure him that i had not lobbied for his job and that the change had surprised me as much as i assumed it had surprised him			0
he must have been in shock , but he greeted me without the slightest touch of rancor			0
we had a short chat and parted with a sincere handshake			0
in this as in all things , @entity65 showed class			0
he was a true gentleman			0
" @entity10 's rise became the stuff of legend			1
and there was @entity65 , doing those daytime newsbreaks in the same building			0
he told me once that he had not given up on getting a bigger job again at the network : " my attitude is , ' let 's play for time here			1
' i 've seen things change			0
" but they did n't			0
when @entity151 launched @entity3 , @entity29 considered asking for work there			1
when @entity154 began its " @entity156 " program , @entity29 held out hope that @entity37 would try to match it late at night			1
" i can do more nighttime television any time they 'd like me to , " he told me			2
" i think i do a pretty fair job on the anchor desk			0
there just are n't that many jobs			0
" he paused , then said : " well , maybe i 'm living in a fool 's paradise			2
the tendency is to give something like that to younger men			0
if the chance came , my wife and i could move back from @entity173 and take an apartment in the city			0
" it had to have hurt , watching @entity10 , and then @entity177 , sit , year after year , in the chair that had been his ; it had to have made him ache over what might have been			1
but on his retirement day in 1988 , delivering his last daytime newsbreak , @entity29 read a few headlines , then paused for the airing of a @entity186 commercial			1
when the live camera came back to him , he could have said anything			0
this is what @entity29 said : " a deep bow of gratitude , love and respect to the men and women of @entity41 and to the company for which they stand			1
to you out there , thank you for honoring me with your presence in our audience , and most of all for your voices -- your most sweet voices			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : @entity29 was network television 's first anchorman
he says @entity29 was replaced by @entity10 to boost ratings
he says @entity29 stayed at @entity41 in a much reduced role
@entity2 : it must have hurt , but @entity29 took it with grace and dedication
