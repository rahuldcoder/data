for any professional woman , finding the right balance between work and family is never any easy task			1
and when your office job is racing @entity11 cars for a living , the leap between the daily grind and bouncing baby feels even wider			2
it 's a juggling act @entity14 will one day tackle -- she 's just got a few things to do on the track first			1
@entity17 became the first female driver in @entity11 in 20 years after joining @entity20 team @entity19 in march in a testing role			2
she now works alongside @entity19 's newly - formed lineup of @entity24 veteran @entity23 and @entity26 rookie @entity25 , and plans to get behind the wheel during the 2012 season			2
the 32 - year - old @entity29 admitted it 's been a hard slog to get there -- and she 's not going to give it up for a baby anytime soon			1
" my family is huge and we are all the time together			2
of course i would like to have the same thing for me			0
if you have a baby , i do n't know how my body , my mind , is going to react , " she told @entity39			0
" if one day i do make that decision i 'll make sure that all my racing goals are achieved			1
i need to make sure of what i 'm thinking -- which is being competitive and not about a little kid waiting at home for me			0
" but @entity50 is proof that kids and the track can mix , having grown up the daughter of former @entity55 driver @entity54			1
" he was a driver in the late ' 70s , early ' 80s and i used to go to see him race			2
i remember the moment when he would tell me , ' please hold my helmet			0
' it was really good having that chance being beside him , " she said			0
" i think he did n't want me to be a racing driver but in the end i just wanted to be like him			1
" considering her racing family , it 's no surprise @entity17 took to the track at an early age -- an experience that gave her a taste of her dream job			1
" my racing career started in @entity78 , where i was born , in a go - kart track , " she said			1
" i remember it was @entity82 time and my brother had a go - kart and i had my first drive that day			1
i was around five and i just went all the way into the front			0
" he was crying and saying , ' you 're crazy , i 'm not going to share with you anymore			0
' " @entity17 is the first woman to be part of the elite motorsport since @entity94 's @entity93 entered three grands prix for @entity96 in 1992 , but failed to qualify for a race			0
just weeks after @entity17 signed with @entity19 , 29 - year - old briton @entity98 joined @entity99 as a test driver			1
@entity98 is just the seventh female @entity55 driver in the 60 - year history of the sport and her recruitment , along with @entity17 , was seen as an important step forward in the gender divide			1
it has n't been an easy ride , though			0
" being a woman did n't stop me			0
i realized i could do it and i could do it good , " @entity17 said			0
" @entity111 has been tough because we 're not as strong as men			0
i had to work really hard in order to make sure i could be strong enough to be driving @entity11			2

@entity55 test driver @entity14 admits she *'d* like a family one day
as a youngster the @entity29 joined racing father @entity54 on the track
her first taste of racing was as a five - year - old beating her brother go - karting
she admits she has had to work hard to compete with men
