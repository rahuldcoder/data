the national controversy over a surge of @entity3 immigrants illegally crossing the @entity5 border established a new battleground this week in a @entity8 small town where angry crowds thwarted detained migrants from entering their community			1
in a faceoff tuesday with three buses carrying the migrants behind screened - off windows , the demonstrators chanted " go back home ! " and " @entity5 " and successfully forced the coaches to leave @entity18 , @entity20 affiliate @entity19 reported			1
the buses instead took the 140 or so undocumented immigrants to @entity5 processing centers at least 80 miles away , in the @entity27 and @entity28 areas , federal officials say			1
counter-protesters squared off with the demonstrators , and a shouting match erupted over the nation 's immigration system , which recently has been overwhelmed with a tide of @entity3 minors illegally entering the @entity5 alone or with other children			1
a mix of poverty , violence and smugglers ' false promises is prompting the @entity3 inflow			1
unlike undocumented @entity45 migrants , who are often immediately deported , the @entity5 government detains and processes the @entity3 , who are eventually released and given a month to report to immigration offices			1
many never show up and join the nation 's 11 million undocumented population , says the @entity50 , the union representing @entity52 agents			2
the @entity54 immigrants rejected by @entity18 protesters were initially held in @entity56 , where @entity5 facilities are so overflowing that detainees are sent to other states for processing			1
the government does n't have the room to shelter the children with adults : there 's only one family immigration detention center , in @entity68			0
to assist the unaccompanied children , president @entity70 's administration opened shelters last month on three military bases because federal facilities more designed for adults were overrun with minors			0
tuesday 's busloads of detained @entity3 immigrants did n't include any unaccompanied minors , said @entity18 police chief @entity79 , who put the number of protesters at 125			1
the children on the buses were apparently in the company of relatives or other adults , said an official with the @entity50			0
' deport ! deport ! ' the protesters , who shouted " @entity89 ! " and " deport ! deport ! " confronted the buses a day after the town posted a notice on its website : " @entity94			2
" " this is a failure to enforce federal law at the federal level , " mayor @entity95 said in a statement monday about the pending arrival of the 140 immigrants to the @entity5 @entity52 station			1
" @entity18 continues to object to the transfer of illegal immigrants to the local border patrol office			1
" @entity95 spoke to @entity20 's " @entity106 " later wednesday			0
" it 's not against the immigrants , " he said			2
" they 're trying to leave a less desirable place and come to the greatest nation in the world			0
we ca n't blame them for that ... no one 's protesting that			0
what we 're protesting is the product of a broken system that finally reached the doorstep of our community			0
" @entity95 said that neither side in the national debate is coming up with a solution : " the problem still is there			2
the problem is in @entity129 " the local controversy was to continue with a town hall meeting scheduled for 6:30 p.m pt wednesday			1
the @entity5 government is scheduled to send another group of undocumented immigrants to @entity18 for processing on friday , the union official for @entity52 agents said			1
chief @entity79 also said he was told to expect 140 immigrants every 72 hours , with the next group scheduled to arrive on friday , the @entity140			1
earlier wednesday , immigration rights advocates denounced the protesters			1
" it is deplorable that people espousing anti-immigrant hate language created unnecessary tension and fear for immigrant mothers and their children , " @entity143 , a community representative of the @entity144 , said in a statement			1
" even more concerning is that elected officials in the @entity154 of @entity18 instigated this tension			1
mothers and their children on these buses have suffered through enough trauma			0
" at a @entity159 meeting tuesday night , @entity95 seemed more conciliatory than his statement posted a day earlier on the city 's website			0
@entity95 thanked police and others			0
" please remember these are human beings that are fleeing the violence in their home countries , " @entity95 said			0
" the problem is that they need to come into this country the legal way			2
" journey from @entity56 the @entity5 government earlier flew the 140 @entity3 immigrants from south @entity56 to @entity27			1
federal agents were busing them to @entity18 for processing at the @entity52 station when the standoff took place tuesday , @entity20 affiliates reported			1
after the buses turned around , the 140 immigrants were taken to the @entity5 @entity52 's @entity185 station in @entity27 , said @entity186 of the @entity50 on wednesday , @entity186 told @entity20 that at least 136 immigrants were fed and screened			1
among the group , 10 children were taken to local hospitals , though it 's unclear why , @entity186 said			0
seven more children were diagnosed with active scabies , an itchy and highly contagious skin disease			0
those children are being kept separate from the others at the @entity185 station , he said			2
seventeen of the immigrants were taken to the @entity202 station in eastern @entity203 , @entity186 said			1
the @entity5 government is struggling to detain and accommodate an influx of undocumented immigrants , particularly a wave of unaccompanied children from the @entity3 countries of @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity211			1
the @entity5 government does n't have enough beds , food or sanitary facilities			0
authorities estimate 60,000 to 80,000 children without parents will cross the border this year in what the @entity219 has called an " immediate humanitarian crisis			0
" to help relieve crowded facilities in @entity56 , undocumented immigrants are now being sent elsewhere to be processed			1
but @entity186 contended that processing immigrants , rather than enforcing the borders , is only making the situation worse			2
" my concern is they are going to be eating in the same holding cells as someone sitting five feet away using the bathroom , " he said			0
intense debate the furor in @entity18 illustrated the conflict between protecting the borders and ensuring the safety of detained immigrants and children			1
protester @entity239 said the country 's identity has eroded with an influx of undocumented immigrants			2
" i just wish @entity54 would be @entity54 again because it 's not , and it 's not just pointed to the @entity244 , " @entity239 said			0
" everybody needs to go through the legal ways			0
" other protesters told @entity20 affiliate @entity248 said they wanted immigrants to follow the legal process to enter the @entity5			2
" everybody that wants to come to this nation is entitled to , but they should come the right way , " @entity251 told the news outlet			0
" you bring in all these children and they 're going to take over our schools , " @entity258 added			0
" what 's going to happen to the kids that were born and raised here ? " but immigration rights advocate @entity266 likened the migration to a refugee crisis and suggested racial antipathy was motivating protesters			1
" if these children were from @entity274 , we would not be having this interview , " @entity266 said			0
" the parents have had enough			0
they are saying , ' if i do n't send my child north , they are going to die			0
' " last month , the @entity70 administration unveiled a plan to spend almost $ 100 million in aid to @entity210 , @entity211 and @entity209 to help reintegrate the undocumented migrants whom the @entity5 will deport , and to help keep them in their home countries			2
the administration also will set aside $ 161.5 million this year for the @entity286 ( @entity286 ) programs in an effort to " help stem migration flows as well as address the root cause of the migration , " the @entity219 said			0
the @entity70 administration has accused syndicates in @entity54 of waging a deliberate campaign of misinformation about relocating to the @entity5 that has caused people in poor @entity3 countries and @entity45 to risk their lives to cross the @entity5 border illegally			2
