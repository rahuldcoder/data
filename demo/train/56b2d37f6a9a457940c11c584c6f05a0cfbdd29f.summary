@entity0 -- just a few days before @entity4 signals the beginning of holiday shopping fury , the @entity3 @entity2 has released its 26th annual " trouble in @entity13 " report , alerting consumers to the dangers and toxins that can still be found in children 's toys			1
the biggest concerns are toys containing chemicals that are potentially toxic , or that contain choking , strangulation or noise hazards			1
while @entity3 @entity21 -- a non-partisan consumer advocacy group -- does not test every toy sold in stores , it takes random samples and has them laboratory tested to check for acceptable levels of toxic substances or other hazards			1
among the key finding in the report is the continued presence of these hazards			0
according to @entity21 , " over 400 children died from toy - related injuries " between 1990 and 2010 , and more than half of those choked			1
" choking on small parts , small balls and balloons is still the leading cause of toy - related injury , " said @entity21 's @entity35 , who presented the report tuesday			1
@entity41 demonstrated the " toilet paper roll test , " a way in which parents can easily determine whether a toy is too small for their infant or toddler			1
if the toy , or pieces from it , can easily pass through the empty roll , the toy can be deemed a potential hazard			2
commissioner @entity54 from the @entity55 , who also spoke at tuesday 's press conference , said it 's been a busy year for his government agency , which works closely with @entity3 pirg			1
@entity54 says this year the produce safety commission has passed the toughest safety standards for cribs , where babies often spend the most unsupervised time			0
in march the commission launched a product - safety database that can be found at @entity67			2
the commission has promulgated rules to reduce the amount of lead in children 's products to among the lowest levels in the world , says @entity54			2
" one of the interesting things about lead and other chemicals we regulate -- they do n't show up in injury reports			1
the problem is , they do affect children , but it 's a chronic cumulative hazard that may not evidence itself until children are involved in later development , " said @entity54			2
he added that lead poisoning can even affect children 's iq levels			0
there are multiple online resources for parents seeking information about the toys they 're purchasing , including www.toysafety.mobi which is an interactive site administered by @entity21 that can be accessed through smart phones			0
@entity3 pirg does n't identify which countries are the biggest culprits with using toxic materials in the manufacture of toys			1
" we do n't think a child or family is all that concerned , if a child chokes on a toy , ( whether the toy is ) made in @entity109 or was made in @entity110			0
all toys that are on the store shelves need to be safe , " the group said			0
both the produce safety commission and @entity21 feel , however , that their agencies are under threat from @entity117 relaxing safety standards , as a result of toy lobbying groups			0
" sadly we 're seeing recurring problems , and what we would argue is that we know what the problems are , and we actually need to fix the problems ... toy manufacturers need to be more vigilant about the products they put out , " said @entity126 , the director of @entity3 @entity21 's federal legislative office			1
with the gift - giving season rapidly approaching , @entity132 -- and parentsâ € ” will be need to use the same guidelines and common sense approach that have been around for the past two decades , before placing gifts under the tree			0
the main rule is to make sure toys are age - appropriate			2
@entity140 , vice president of standards and government affairs for the @entity142 said consumers should feel confident that the toys they purchase are safe			0
" so much has been done in the name of toy safety , from government and industry , so consumers should feel quite comforted that what they find , has been found safe , " said @entity145 .			0
