-- @entity1 does n't want your pity			0
@entity1 says wearing the hijab sometimes interferes with usual @entity6 teenager activities , but that it 's worth it to her faith			1
she does n't want your frosty public stares ; the whispers behind her back ; the lament that she 's been degraded by her father			0
what the @entity15 high school senior wants you to understand is that she does n't wear the hijab , the head scarf worn by @entity15 women , because she is submissive			1
" it represents beauty to me , " says @entity20 , the 17 - year - old daughter of two @entity23 parents living in @entity24 , @entity25			0
" my mom says a girl is like a jewel , " @entity20 says			0
" when you have something precious , you usually hide it			0
you want to make sure you keep it safe until that treasure is ready to be found			0
" the nation has heard plenty of debate over racial profiling			0
but there 's a form of religious profiling that some young @entity15 women in @entity6 say they endure whenever they voluntarily wear the hijab			1
the hijab , also known as the veil , is the headscarf worn by @entity15 women around the globe			1
it 's a simple piece of cloth , but it can place young @entity15 women in @entity53 countries in difficult situations			1
some hijab - wearers say that strangers treat them as if they 're terrorists			1
others ask them if they 're a nun -- or even allergic to the sun. in some cases , their worst critics are not @entity6 , but fellow @entity62			1
the pressure on @entity15 teenagers in the @entity6 who wear the hijab may be even more acute			1
their challenge : how do i fit in when i wear something that makes me stand out ? @entity69 , who has written two novels about this question , says wearing the hijab can " exhaust " some young @entity15 women in the @entity75			1
" you can sometimes feel like you 're in a zoo : locked in the cage of other people 's stereotypes , prejudices and judgments , on parade to be analyzed , deconstructed and reconstructed , " says @entity76 , a @entity15 who has @entity79 and @entity23 parents but was born in @entity80			1
@entity76 says people should not assume that @entity15 women who wear the hijab are being controlled by men			1
she , too , struggled with the choice of wearing a hijab when she was a teenager			1
" when it comes to the hijab -- why to wear it , whether to wear it , how to wear it -- there is theology and then there is practice and there is huge diversity in both , " says @entity76 , author of " @entity105 ? " the surprising history behind the hijab some women say the hijab makes them feel like they 're locked in a cage			1
but others say it leads to personal freedom			0
@entity114 first wore the hijab at age 15 growing up in @entity117 , @entity118			2
she is the daughter of @entity120 parents who left @entity120 in 1979 during the @entity15 revolution			2
@entity114 says the hijab liberated her from some teenage angst : does my hair look good ? am i cute enough ? should i lose weight ? " it gave me a sense of identity , " she says			2
" i really liked the purpose behind the hijab -- a woman covering herself so that a man should know her for her mind , not her body			2
" that purpose can be traced back to the @entity138 , @entity15 's holy text , which encourages women to dress modestly , says @entity140 , author of " @entity141			1
" some @entity142 take the @entity138 's advice as a command for women to wear the hijab , while others disagree , she says			1
" the quran is very ambiguous about whether you have to wear the veil or not , " @entity140 says			2
the hijab , however , actually predates @entity15 , @entity140 explains			1
the first known reference to veiling ( @entity140 uses the term hijab and veil interchangeably ) was made in an @entity156 legal text in the 13th century @entity157 , @entity140 says			2
in the @entity156 , and later , the @entity160 and @entity161 empires , the veil was a symbol of prestige and status , she says			0
by the 12th century , the veil had been imposed on women in the @entity15 world to exclude them from public life , @entity140 says			1
" a sign of distinction had been transformed into a sign of exclusion , " she writes in her book			0
people are still debating the meaning of the hijab today			2
in 2007 , @entity178 @entity15 groups protested when schools were given the right to ban students from wearing full - face veils			1
in 2008 , @entity184 's top court upheld a ban on wearing @entity15 headscarves at the country 's universities			1
that same year , a @entity15 woman was briefly jailed at a suburban @entity190 , @entity191 , courthouse after refusing to remove her hijab in court			1
some moms against hijab wearing the debate over the hijab can literally hit home for some young @entity15 women			1
those that wear the hijab in the @entity6 can befuddle their mothers , who often immigrated to the @entity75 so they could be free from wearing the hijab and other rules imposed on women			1
that 's what happened to @entity114 , the @entity62 from @entity117			0
her mother , @entity209 , was puzzled by her daughter 's decision to wear the hijab			2
@entity213 grew up in @entity120 , where she did not wear the hijab			2
young women who attended college in @entity120 like she did generally did n't wear the hijab , she says			1
@entity213 warned her daughter that wearing the hijab would arouse the suspicion of @entity6			1
" i said @entity114 , when you cover your head here the people think you are political -- they see you differently , " @entity213 says			2
most of the trouble , though , came from @entity120 - @entity6 , who came to the @entity6 to escape the @entity15 fundamentalists who seized power in 1979 , she says			1
" the @entity120 here bother her more than @entity6 , " @entity213 says			2
" they say , ' we got rid of you guys			0
we came here because we did n't want to see you guys anymore			0
' " @entity114 was more concerned as a teenager about more personal issues , like her relations with boys			2
the hijab made it more difficult , she says			2
few asked her on dates			0
guys always seemed to put her in the " friend category			0
" she wondered if she was attractive			0
" i wondered at times : am i always going to be a guy 's friend and nothing more			0
" strangers in public saw her as something else -- a subjugated woman			0
they looked at her with pity , she says			0
" one guy asked me if i was allergic to the sun , " @entity114 says			0
@entity20 , the @entity25 high school senior , also had her tense public encounters : angry looks , people feeling sorry for her or assuming her father ordered her to wear the hijab			1
" it 's not oppression ; it 's not that i 'm accepting degradation -- it 's about self - respect , " she says			0
but it 's more about faith as well			2
she says the hijab affirms " @entity15 in the most respectful and purified way			1
" " when you actually wear it , it opens your eyes , " she says			0
" it makes you want to explore your religious faith			0
" at times , @entity20 says she wonders what it would be like to attend her prom , get a tan at the beach and have a boyfriend			0
but she says her decision to honor her faith is already paying off			0
" it really feels good , " she says			0
" it felt like i was missing something and now i 'm complete			0
i finally understand my purpose			0

the hijab is the head scarf worn by @entity15 women
wearing one as a @entity15 teenager in the @entity6 may offer challenges
some wearers say they get strange looks and sometimes angry *remarks*
but those who voluntarily wear it say it can help them in their faith and teen life
