@entity0 -- nearly all healthy pregnant women who receive a single dose of the h1n1 flu vaccine will be protected from that flu , according to just - released clinical trial data			1
in a news conference monday at the headquarters of the @entity10 @entity9 , dr. @entity11 , director of the @entity12 , said out of about 100 pregnant women who participated in trial studies , over 90 percent showed a robust immune response to a single 15 - microgram dose of the @entity4 vaccine			1
and at this point , there have been no reported side effects , @entity11 said			2
@entity11 stressed that these results should be reassuring for already - vaccinated pregnant women and this is " vital information for those who have not yet been vaccinated			1
" he added that " pregnant women have tolerated the vaccine well , and no safety concerns have arisen			1
" pregnant women are considered to be among the highest at risk for serious complications of this new flu strain			1
since @entity4 , also known as swine flu , first emerged in april , 28 pregnant women reportedly have died from complications of this flu , according to the @entity36 ( @entity36 )			1
despite health officials repeatedly saying the @entity4 vaccine is safe , questions about it persist			2
to reassure those who question the safety of the vaccine , dr. @entity41 , director of the @entity42 , noted that a new independent panel has been formed to review data from all sources on the safety of the vaccine			2
the group will monitor all sources reporting problems with the vaccine			0
" the vast amount of adverse events have been minor , " said @entity41			0
he said there has been one reported death linked to the vaccine , but further investigation showed that the person died from the actual @entity4 flu , not the vaccine			1
@entity41 said the panel was designed to keep an eye on any possible negative consequences and report them immediately			0
according to dr. @entity62 , director of the @entity63 at the @entity36 , who also attended the news conference , 30 million doses of the vaccine are available for states to order			2
she explained that that does not mean 30 million shots are available to the public at this point			0
the vaccines need to be ordered by each state and distributed before they make it to doctor 's offices and clinics			0
@entity62 reassured the public that more vaccines would be made available within the next few weeks , as demand for shots continues to rise			0
@entity11 also noted further studies on children -- youngsters between the ages of 6 months to 35 months , and children from the age of 3 years to 9 years -- found they responded much better to two 15 - microgram doses of the vaccine , than one single dose			1
for children 9 and older , a single 15 - microgram dose gave young people a robust immune reaction that should protect them against the virus			1
when asked how this @entity4 virus differed from the seasonal flu , @entity62 said they were at opposite ends of the spectrum when it came to high - risk patients			0
" with seasonal flu , " said @entity62 , " ninety percent of the deaths every year are in people over the age of 65			0
" she noted , " but with @entity4 , 90 percent of the deaths , thus far , have been in people under the age of 65			0
" and she added , " half of those are under the age of 25 years , in young people			1
so those are the people we want to get our message to			0
children , pregnant women , young people should be getting vaccinated			1
" @entity11 agreed saying , " you need to look at the risk ... right now , the risk of becoming seriously ill , even dying from this virus , outweighs the risk of something happening to you if you take the vaccine			2
it 's really that simple			0
" @entity1 's @entity124 contributed to this report .			0
