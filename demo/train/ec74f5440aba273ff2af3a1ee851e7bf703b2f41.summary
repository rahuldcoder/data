and lead actress ( for @entity14 , who plays @entity1 )			1
all the @entity7 love for " @entity4 's " spectacular first season -- in which @entity19 ' troubled @entity18 agent tried to prove that @entity11 ' returned prisoner of war had been turned by the enemy -- can only help build anticipation for the around - the - corner second season , slated to kick off this coming sunday on @entity24			1
" we 're all wondering what 's next , " said @entity25 , who plays @entity1 's @entity18 mentor , @entity26			1
" what 's going to happen to her ? to him ? to them ? to the world ? we 're all so curious			2
it really is a piece that second - guesses every answer , five or 10 seconds later			2
it 's like , ' whoa ! i did n't see that coming			0
' " when the show returns , six months have lapsed since @entity1 voluntarily started electroshock treatment for her bipolar condition , which caused her to lose a few crucial memories -- including one about @entity12 yelling out the name of a terrorist 's son in his sleep			1
not knowing this , the discredited @entity1 has been able to let go of her obsession to prove @entity12 has been turned by @entity51 and has spent her time away from the @entity18 living with her sister and her father , teaching @entity54 to adult students			1
meanwhile , @entity12 , after deciding not to detonate a bomb to kill the vice president , has further entrenched himself into politics			0
not only has brody been elected to @entity59 , but he 's also being vetted as a potential candidate for the next vice president , which ups the stakes in a number of ways			0
" @entity12 's just everybody 's b * * * * now , " @entity11 says with a laugh			1
" last year , it was all about @entity1 getting squeezed by her illness , her condition , and this year , it 's about @entity12 being caught between the forces , the two sides , " executive producer and writer @entity70 said			1
" he could be more dangerous in a political position			0
he 's asking , ' why kill a person when i can kill an idea ? ' and then we wonder , does he mean that ? or is he now playing both sides ? " although the audience knows now whether @entity12 had in fact been turned and if @entity1 was off - base in her suspicions , season 2 wo n't suffer from any loss of ambiguity , @entity11 said			1
" i was concerned at first , because season 1 presented @entity12 as the threat , the menace of the show , while at the same time , eliciting sympathy from the audience , " the actor said			0
" i enjoyed the confusion of that , too			0
but there is more pressure this season -- more anxiety , more paranoia , more sweaty palms ! " even in @entity1 's absence , the pressure is on the home front because @entity12 's wife , @entity107 , is " no longer in the dark , " said @entity109 , who plays @entity107			1
@entity12 's daughter @entity113 , who made the crucial phone call to stop @entity12 in the act last season , " knows something 's not right , " said actress @entity110 , who portrays the teen			2
" there are things that are going to come out , " @entity110 added			0
" @entity1 definitely planted a seed in her			2
" @entity1 's eventual return to the @entity18 -- even just informally , not as an employee -- also sweats @entity12 's palms as he wonders whether she 's back on his trail			1
( she 's not -- at least not initially )			0
in the first episode of the season , " @entity131 , " a @entity18 source refuses to talk to anyone but @entity1 , which causes the agency to seek her help			1
" there will be things that come out of that meeting , " @entity70 promised			0
" and there will be battles and allegiances within the agency involved in bringing her back			0
there 's sort of a turf war , and it 's sort of incendiary			0
" the operation takes place in @entity145 ( but was shot in @entity146 ) , and to get into the region , @entity1 changes her appearance and travels under a false @entity150			2
" i love @entity1 as a brunette , " @entity24 chairman and ceo @entity152 said			2
" i told @entity154 , ' you 're the only one who can look that hot as a blonde and a brunette in a single hour			0
' " although she 's disguised , her cover at one point gets blown -- and she gets out of the jam with an ingenious technique that signals that the @entity1 is back			1
" she 's been put through the wringer , right ? " @entity14 said			1
" so i think she 's starting to get some validation and the vindication she 's been looking for			1
and i think people are rooting for her			0
i 'm so honored to be playing her			0
" " the first year , we knew we had something special , " @entity25 said			0
" but you have to ask why : ' why do they like it ? ' so in hindsight , i 'd say that it hit a nerve about the longing to understand , and the lost ability to listen and understand like @entity1 does			2
" although @entity1 has spent the past six months of the show not listening , and not understanding , there will come a point when she recognizes that she was n't wrong after all , @entity70 promised			2
" @entity1 reconciled herself to the belief that she was wrong , " he said , " and the pieces realign and take off in a way where there 's a huge reckoning			1
it 's a season - long process , " building , perhaps , to a moment when @entity1 and @entity12 finally meet up again			1
( or so it seems from the previews , which also suggest a blood - covered @entity12 burying a body			0
but as everyone involved with the show cautions , " it 's not what you think it is			0
" ) " the season really is about how does the @entity202 story pan out , " @entity70 said			0
" there 's a lot more to come , but those two , whenever @entity1 and @entity12 are on - screen together , it 's amazing			1

anticipation is *sky* - high for the return of @entity7 - winning @entity212 '
star @entity11 said there will be " more pressure this season "
the first episode sees @entity14 ' @entity1 disguise herself for a *mission*
@entity19 : @entity1 starts to get the validation and vindication she 's been looking for
