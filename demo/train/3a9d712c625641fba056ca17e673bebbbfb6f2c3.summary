-- @entity1 traveled from @entity2 to @entity3 before testing positive for @entity4			1
the first @entity4 case diagnosed in the @entity6 has raised many questions and concerns , which @entity0 has been responding to on social media using the hashtag # @entity10			1
you can check out the latest updates on the story at @entity15			0
we 'll continue to answer them online and on tv , but here are some of your most frequently asked questions : how long can @entity4 live on a surface ? in one study by the @entity25 , the ebola virus lived on a surface in a perfectly controlled environment for up to six days			1
but the environment at an airport , for example , or a school is not perfectly suited to support viruses			2
studies done in @entity35 in @entity36 , @entity25 spokeswoman @entity33 says , show the virus can live on surfaces for a few hours at most			1
" @entity4 is a vicious virus inside the body , but it dies very quickly on surfaces , " she said			1
" it ' s not a hardy virus			2
it 's a very wimpy virus			2
" @entity4 is easily destroyed outside of the body , experts say			1
uv light , heat and exposure to oxygen all deactivate the virus over time			0
@entity25 director dr. @entity50 said that while it 's theoretically possible for someone to catch @entity4 by touching a surface that an infected patient sneezed on , for example , past outbreaks have shown that direct contact with a patient 's bodily fluids is the way the virus is spread			1
what kills the virus ? health care workers -- and @entity0 's reporters -- in @entity36 rely on bleach			1
but the @entity25 says any @entity68 - approved disinfectant -- @entity69 , @entity70 , etc. -- will work on a nonporous surface			1
a dishwasher or washing machine will also kill it , @entity33 says			0
would any bodily fluids this patient flushed contaminate the water system ? the virus would n't survive long in water , @entity79 - @entity78 at @entity80 , a company that tracks global infectious diseases , told @entity84			1
the virus depends heavily , he said , on its host -- either a human or animal -- to stay active			0
@entity6 sanitary sewers and our waste water treatment system will kill the virus , @entity89 agrees			1
" there 's no concern there			0
" could the virus become airborne ? right now , " common sense and observation tell us that spread of the virus via coughing or sneezing is rare , if it happens at all , " the @entity98 says			0
it 's possible @entity4 could eventually be transmitted through the air			1
experts say the chances are relatively small that @entity4 will make that jump			2
but every time a new person gets @entity4 , the virus gets another chance to develop new capabilities			1
@entity4 is an rna virus , which means every time it copies itself , it makes one or two mutations			1
yet @entity98 says , " speculation that ebola virus disease might mutate into a form that could easily spread among humans through the air is just that : speculation , unsubstantiated by any evidence			1
" will @entity1 receive an experimental drug ? maybe			0
dr. @entity50 , director of the @entity25 , said tuesday the @entity124 hospital was discussing all treatment options with the patient and his family			1
there is no approved drug or vaccine for @entity4			2
the experimental drug given to dr. @entity132 and @entity133 , the first @entity4 patients flown to the @entity6 , is called @entity135			2
the company that produces @entity135 has said it is out of doses , though it is working to create more			0
dr. @entity139 , the @entity6 doctor treated for @entity4 in @entity140 , was given another experimental drug called @entity4			2
there are reportedly still doses of this drug available			0
only the facts : @entity4 experimental drugs are the people who were on his flights at risk ? no. the ebola virus spreads only when someone is exhibiting symptoms			1
this patient arrived in the @entity6 on september 20 , according to the @entity25 , and did n't get sick until several days later			1
so he was n't contagious on the flight			0
he was put in isolation at @entity157 on september 28 and will not be released until he is free of the virus			0
but how can they be sure he was n't sick earlier ? that 's a fair question			0
they ca n't be 100 % sure			0
but the first sign of @entity4 is generally a high fever			2
and everyone leaving @entity2 has their temperature checked before they 're allowed to board a plane			0
plus , health experts have said that anyone who is sick enough to be contagious probably does n't feel well enough to travel in the first place			0
why did n't the hospital release @entity1 's name and photo earlier ? the @entity176 's @entity175 prevents hospitals or medical providers from releasing identifiable patient information without the patient 's permission			0
when do @entity4 symptoms start , and what are they ? ebola symptoms typically appear eight to 10 days after infection			1
but they can start anywhere from two to 21 days after infection			2
early symptoms include a high fever , muscle aches and chills -- similar to early symptoms of the flu			0
the virus then progresses to severe vomiting and diarrhea , with a possible rash and painful cough			0
patients near death sometimes bleed from their eyes , mouth or other orifices as they begin to bleed internally			0
why are n't @entity6 borders being closed to travelers from this region ? the easiest way to prevent an @entity4 outbreak in the @entity6 is to prevent travelers from the region from flying here in the first place , right ? " we can not make the [ @entity4 ] risk zero until the outbreak is controlled in west africa , " @entity50 said thursday			1
he says isolating those countries completely through travel restrictions would make it more difficult to assist in controlling the outbreak and would eventually put the @entity6 at greater risk			0
think about all the health care workers , volunteers and military personnel who are selflessly going to @entity36 to offer assistance			2
should they be forced to stay overseas until the outbreak is over ? would as many go if they knew they would n't be allowed back ? " the international community is really asking us to continue operations , " said @entity229 , a spokesman for @entity230			0
" we are a vital link for logistics and all kinds of material that need to go into ( @entity2 )			0
" the @entity25 has warned against any nonessential travel to the region			2
@entity241 agents have been trained to spot common @entity4 symptoms			1
temperatures are not checked on arrival , but if a passenger arrives who is exhibiting symptoms , major international airports have the ability to quarantine him or her immediately			0
customs agents have also begun distributing a @entity25 fact sheet on @entity4 to travelers at major international airports			1
how the ebola virus spreads i 'm traveling to @entity124 soon			1
should i be worried ? not really			0
the @entity25 and local health departments are working to find anyone @entity1 came in contact with while he was contagious , and monitor them for symptoms			1
if any of them become contagious , they will be placed in isolation as well			0
but just to be safe , follow the basic rules of infection prevention : avoid people who are sick and wash your hands frequently			2

people on the same flights with @entity4 patient are not at risk , @entity25 says
ebola symptoms typically appear eight to 10 days after infection
the ebola virus can live for up to six days on a surface in a perfect environment
bleach is the method used in @entity36 to kill it
