@entity0 -- lawyers for former @entity4 chief @entity3 urged a judge on wednesday to dismiss a civil suit brought against him by the @entity0 hotel housekeeper who accused him of assaulting her last year			1
the case " must be dismissed , " asserted lawyer @entity9 , because @entity3 enjoyed diplomatic immunity as an " executive of a multilateral organization			1
" judge @entity14 told the @entity16 courtroom that he would " expeditiously issue a decision " deciding whether the case could proceed			0

he resigned his position soon after his arrest by @entity0 police in may 2011 , when he was charged with criminally assaulting a housekeeper in a @entity30 hotel suite			2

lawyer @entity55 told the court wednesday that @entity3 " brutally sexually assaulted " @entity31 , arguing that @entity3 does not enjoy blanket diplomatic immunity from civil action			1
as head of the @entity4 , @entity3 did enjoy some immunity , but a key sticking point is whether it extended to situations beyond his official duties			1

" absolute immunity does not apply to all situations			0
" @entity3 's lawyers did not invoke his immunity from prosecution during the criminal case			1
