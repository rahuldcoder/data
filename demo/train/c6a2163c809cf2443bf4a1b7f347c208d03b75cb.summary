-- president @entity1 is in @entity2 today			1
@entity2 is the center of the current crisis at the border			1
from @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 , thousands upon thousands of children are pouring into the @entity10			0
this flood of foreign children is not a problem of border security			2
they are not sneaking across the border illegally			2
under the @entity19 of 2008 , unaccompanied minors from these countries can present themselves at a legal border crossing , claim to be political refugees and seek asylum			2
the argument on the left is that these three countries have violent gangs and therefore we have a moral obligation to take in their children			0
one @entity32 senator told me that the real key was to end violence in those three countries			0
given last weekend 's 82 shot and 16 killed in @entity37 , i wanted to ask that senator how he thought his policies would be more successful in @entity40 than they have been in our third - largest city			1
it is in this context of the liberal fantasy -- that we owe the world everything , we can do nothing to protect ourselves and everyone else is innocent while we @entity10 somehow have an extra burden to take care of their problems -- that you have to view the president 's current actions			1
the president 's trip highlights vividly the failure of @entity1 - ism			1
it is clear he wants our money			0
he is doing two big @entity32 fundraisers in @entity2 this week to get political money			0
he has just sent up a request to @entity65 for an additional $ 3.7 billion to address the immigration crisis on the southern border -- the majority of which would go toward caring for the unaccompanied minors crossing the border			1
still , this request is larger than the entire @entity10 @entity74 budget in 2013			0
sen. @entity75 of @entity76 , on @entity0 's " crossfire " tuesday night , demolished the president 's proposal			1
" that 's $ 60,000 per child that we 're going to spend , in emergency money , " he pointed out			1
( parents and students trying to get through college should contemplate that number			0
) " that shows just how incompetent we [ are ] -- we ca n't do that for three or four thousand per child ? ... if we ca n't do that , the @entity74 is as bad as the @entity92			0
" " for $ 8 million , " he pointed out later in the show , " we can put them all on a first - class seat back to their homes			1
" actually , he exaggerated a little bit			0
a business class flight from @entity101 to @entity102 is about $ 450			2
lowest economy ticket is $ 318			0
for the 60,000 young people entering the @entity10 this year under the @entity19 , flying home commercially would be in the range of $ 18 to $ 26 million plus the cost of staffing etc. so the @entity75 plan might cost ( once staff , etc. is included ) in the $ 40 million to $ 80 million range			1
that means , of course , that the @entity75 plan would save at least $ 3.62 billion over the @entity1 plan			1
why is the @entity1 plan so expensive ? simple			1
left - wing @entity32 wake up every morning knowing the answer is bigger government and more money			0
they just do n't know what the question is			0
the border crisis is a new opportunity for @entity1 to create even bigger government , spending even more of our children 's money			1
in a rational world it would be an absurdity , but this is the world of @entity1 and sen. @entity131 , and nothing involving more spending and bigger government is absurd to them			2
@entity75 also noted that the current scale of the border crisis would disappear if @entity65 would simply repeal the @entity19			2
chairman @entity137 of the @entity138 also notes that there are a number of executive actions the president could take which would end the open borders for foreign children policy			0
the @entity1 administration policy of " @entity146 " was an executive decision to begin with ( and one of questionable legality )			2
the president certainly has the authority to enforce immigration law			2
the @entity1 policy instead assumes the border will remain open and he wants to use taxpayer money to fund the lengthy process of getting children from @entity40 involved in the @entity10 legal system			1
it is a great excuse to have the government hire even more lawyers			0
@entity138 @entity162 should immediately repeal the @entity19 and call on the president to do everything within his power to stop this rush on our borders			1
let 's see how long @entity32 senators up for reelection can allow @entity131 to bottle up a solution to the flood of foreign children coming into our country			0
three cheers for senator @entity75 and a loud " no " to president @entity1 is the right response to this mess			1
join us on @entity183 / @entity182 .			0

@entity185 warns that president @entity1 's border plan spends too much and does little
@entity1 proposed an additional $ 3.7 billion for the immigration crisis on the southern border
for a *fraction* of that , one @entity162 senator said , he could fly every immigrant back home , first class
