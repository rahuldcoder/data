-- when @entity4 's @entity3 smartphone went on sale in the @entity6 in february , two things made it , um , noteworthy			2
at 5.3â € ³ , its display was the largest one ever offered on a phone			2
and the note came with @entity4 's @entity3 , a precision stylus which let you jot notes and sketch pictures without jabbing at the screen with your finger			1
let 's face it , though -- that humongous screen completely overshadowed the @entity3			0
everyone had a strong opinion about it			0
many people found the notion of a phone with a screen that edges in on tablet territory alluring : @entity4 says it 's shipped ten million @entity29 to date			1
others , however , considered that same notion to be comical rather than practical			0
( held to the ear , the jumbo - sized @entity3 tends to throw off proportions and make it look like your skull has shrunk by a size or two			0
) now @entity4 is releasing its second @entity3 device , the @entity38 , which goes on sale in the @entity6 thursday			0
this note , unlike its smartphone sibling , should n't be an object of controversy			0
the @entity44 for 2012 there 's nothing startling about its form factor : it 's an @entity49 tablet with a 10.1â € ³ display , a size that 's comfortably familiar in the @entity49 world , and not radically dissimilar from the 9.7 - incher on @entity54 's @entity53			1
but it 's a solid , straightforward @entity49 tablet that comes with an @entity3 , a suite of pen - friendly apps and some productivity - oriented software enhancements which give it a more businesslike flavor than @entity4 's @entity62 2 10.1			1
the @entity38 with @entity63 of storage lists for $ 499 , the same price as a @entity53			1
but the @entity66 is $ 549 , $ 50 less than a @entity67			1
and while there 's no @entity72 model , the tablet 's microsd slot lets you add a @entity75 memory card for $ 20 or less , bringing capacity up to @entity72 for a grand total of about $ 570 -- a steep discount off the @entity80 's $ 699 sticker price			1
both the @entity63 and @entity75 variants offer wi - fi but no cellular option and come with @entity84 of @entity86 online storage for two years			0
if the @entity38 sells well , it wo n't be on the strength of the bang it delivers for your buck			0
it 'll be because it 's one of the relatively few @entity49 tablets with a snappy answer to the bottom - line question " why should somebody buy this instead of an @entity53 ? " the @entity53 does n't come with a pen and may never do so , given @entity101 ' famous declaration that " if you see a stylus , they blew it			1
" scads of companies have stepped in to fill the gap -- my favorite @entity53 stylus is @entity111 's @entity110 -- but all of their designs suffer from the fact that they 're designed to work with a tablet that was engineered for fingertips			1
@entity4 , however , built the @entity38 from the ground up for pen use			1
and when it decided to add pens to some of its devices , it made the eminently sensible decision to work with @entity123 , the company which dominates the market for graphics tablets used by artists			0
the @entity3 , which stows in a slot on tablet 's side when not in use , is based on @entity123 's technology			1
that means that it 's pressure - sensitive and extremely precise , and does n't use a battery			0
using it feels like writing with a slightly stubby ballpoint ; @entity4 also sells a larger pen , as well as one with an " eraser " on the opposite end from the nib			1
tech companies make progress on ' blood phones ' @entity49 does n't come with any apps meant expressly for pen use			1
so @entity4 created some of its own , including @entity147 , a highly capable note - taking program which lets you write and draw on simulated lined pages , graph paper and blank sheets			2
you can use a fine - line pen , a pencil , a paintbrush or a highlighter ; pressure sensitivity lets you vary your pen strokes or lay down a thicker coat of paint by pressing harder			2
@entity147 can also convert your block - letter or cursive input into editable text			0
it did a surprisingly accurate job of deciphering my chicken scratchings			0
but as with every other device i 've ever used with handwriting recognition , the payoff did n't seem worth the effort required : you need to write words a few at a time , then pause while the tablet interprets them			2
except for brief notes , if you want to see your words in a crisp , legible typeface rather than your own handwriting , you 're probably best off using the on - screen keyboard			2
( @entity4 sells a case , obviously inspired by the @entity53 's @entity181 , which lets you angle the tablet for comfy typing			2
) unlike the @entity53 , the @entity38 is designed to let you rest your palm on the screen as you write or draw without getting confused by the fact that two parts of your hand are in contact with the display at once			2
despite this , i found myself occasionally triggering actions unintentionally as i worked			0
i suspect that the fact i 'm a southpaw does n't help : when i begin to write on the left - hand side of the screen , my palm rests on top of @entity49 's on - screen buttons for tasks such as going back one screen and returning to the home screen			1
a righty 's palm would fall in a less critical spot			0
the @entity3 works in other apps besides @entity147 , of course			2
i liked using it to crop photos and perform touch - up work in @entity212 , which @entity4 throws in for free			0
the tablet includes a program that points you towards pen - friendly programs in @entity218 's play store ; most of the ones i tried did n't support pressure sensitivity , but the @entity3 is still a plus in any program that involves handwritten note - taking , sketching or any gesture that 's tough to perform accurately with a fingertip			1
pen aside , this is one of the best big - screen @entity49 tablets i 've tried , a nicely - styled 1.3 - pound package that 's a skosh lighter than an @entity53 and does n't look too much like an @entity53 clone			1
( @entity4 , presumably , would like to minimize the future time it spends squabbling with @entity54 in court			0
) trial gives sneak peek into @entity54 's inner workings			0

on the @entity238 tablet , the stylus pen is the key
@entity49 tablet has apps specifically designed for the pen
a 32gb version , with card bringing it to @entity72 , is $ 570 ; @entity80 is $ 699
pen app still not *convenient* for taking notes , *reviewer* says
