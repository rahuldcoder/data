the @entity9 government released @entity6 just over a year ago on the grounds that he had cancer and was not likely to live more than three more months			1
@entity6 is the only person convicted in the bombing of @entity7 , which exploded over @entity14 , @entity9 , in december 1988 , killing 259 people on the plane and 11 on the ground			1
most of the dead were @entity2			0
the flight was heading to @entity21 from @entity22 , @entity23 , via @entity24 , @entity25 , when it blew up			0
a special @entity9 court in the @entity27 convicted @entity6 in 2001			1
@entity6 is " a very sick man , " but there is no way to tell how long he will live , according to the father of one of the people who died in the 1988 bombing			1
@entity34 , whose daughter @entity35 died in the terror attack , said earlier this month that he recently saw @entity6 in @entity37			1
@entity34 criticized @entity2 senators who tried to hold hearings this summer into questions surrounding the release of @entity6			1
he said he had written to them to say it was more important to let @entity9 legal proceedings run their course , because a review commission had found possible miscarriages of justice in the case			1
" they did n't want to know about that , " he said of the senators			0
@entity34 , who said he does not think that @entity6 is guilty , defended the decision			1
" at three months , just over half [ of people with his cancer ] would be dead , " @entity34 said			1
doctors have said @entity6 has terminal prostate cancer			2
but after three months , mortality rates level off , and there is no way to predict how long cancer patients will live , said @entity34 , a retired general practitioner			2
" he can walk a few steps , " @entity34 said of @entity6			2
he did not ask @entity6 or his doctors about the @entity37 's medical condition out of respect for his privacy , he said			2
but he said the fullness of his face suggested that he was on steroids to slow the cancer			0
@entity6 was appealing his conviction when he was freed on compassionate grounds in august 2009			1
he then dropped the appeal			0
@entity34 said he thinks @entity6 feels guilty about having withdrawn his appeal , because it leaves him with no way to clear his name and no way for those -- like @entity82 -- who think he is innocent , to have the case reviewed			1
but @entity6 's death could change the legal playing field , @entity34 speculated			2
" if he were to die , the the situation would change , " and @entity82 might be able to get the case reopened , he said			0
@entity82 is in the minority among victims ' families in thinking that @entity6 is innocent			2
@entity2 officials have blasted officials for releasing @entity6			2
" as we have expressed repeatedly to @entity9 authorities , we maintain that @entity6 should serve out the entirety of his sentence in prison in @entity9 , " secretary of state @entity93 said in a written statement			1
president @entity100 's assistant on homeland security and counter-terrorism , @entity103 , called the release " unfortunate and inappropriate			0
" @entity106 sens. @entity105 and @entity107 noted that @entity6 was given three months to live when he was released , but is still alive			1
@entity105 noted that on august 20 , 2009 , @entity6 stepped off a plane into the arms of a cheering throng in @entity37			0
" a mass murderer tasted freedom , experiencing joy , " @entity105 said			0
" it was a scene that made the stomach turn ... that made old wounds fresh again in the hearts of those whose family members died at the hands of that man			0
" " @entity6 ... is very much free , living in the lap of luxury by all accounts , " @entity105 said			0
@entity107 said : " it is the families of those victims who deserve compassion , not this terrorist			0
" the case has outraged many on both sides of the @entity134 and led @entity2 senators to demand answers from @entity9 about the details of his release			0
