the @entity0 caught the man accused of creating @entity2 -- the shadowy e-commerce site it describes as " the most sophisticated and extensive criminal marketplace on the @entity5 today " -- after he allegedly posted his @entity7 address online , according to court documents			1
federal agents swooped on @entity10 in a @entity12 public library tuesday afternoon , charging the 29 - year - old @entity13 with narcotics trafficking , computer hacking and money laundering			1
they allege he is " the @entity10 , " the @entity2 's mysterious founder , who drew his pseudonym from the feared , fictitious character in the film @entity22			2
the @entity0 claims the former physics and engineering student even publicly alluded to his alleged criminal enterprise on his @entity27 profile , with a statement describing how his goals had " shifted " in accordance with his libertarian economic views since leaving grad school at @entity34			1
@entity10 's @entity27 profile states that , since completing his studies in 2010 , he has focused on " creating an economic simulation to give people a first - hand experience of what it would be like to live in a world without the systemic use of force " of the kind imposed by " institutions and governments			1
" " i want to use economic theory as a means to abolish the use of coercion and agression ( sic ) amongst mankind , " he wrote			0
in the indictment against @entity10 , filed in a @entity58 court , the @entity0 cyber-crime specialist who led the investigation , @entity55 , stated that he believed " that this ' economic simulation ' referred to by @entity10 is @entity2			1
" the @entity60 of vice the @entity0 swiftly shuttered the site , an underground digital marketplace that , since its inception in 2011 , has allowed users to anonymously trade illegal goods and services in near total secrecy , using the digital currency bitcoin , and an encryption network called @entity71 that routes traffic through a " hidden " area of the internet known as " the dark web			1
" time.com : online drug markets alive and thriving @entity55 said the site " sought to make conducting illegal transactions on the internet as easy and frictionless as shopping online at mainstream e-commerce websites , " and carried listings for hard drugs , hackers , counterfeit cash , forged @entity87 documents , firearms , ammunition , even hitmen -- one of whom @entity10 is alleged to have enlisted to kill a blackmailer			1
according to the indictment , @entity2 had acquired nearly a million registered users worldwide -- about 30 % of whom were based in the @entity13 -- in its two and a half years of operation , providing them guidance on how to encrypt their communications and vacuum - pack their wares before shipping through the postal service to avoid detection by law enforcement			1
last year , it said , the site added a " stealth mode " for users who considered themselves " at risk of becoming a target for law enforcement			2
" the indictment said the site had generated over 9.5 million bitcoins in sales revenue and over 600,000 bitcoins in commissions for its owner , allowing the site to employ a team of administrators			2
the value of bitcoins has fluctuated dramatically since the digital currency was created -- it plummeted after @entity10 's arrest -- but @entity55 estimated @entity2 's turnover to be worth about $ 1.2 billion in sales , and $ 80 million in commissions			1
in february , an @entity126 drug dealer became the first person to be convicted in connection to @entity2 after using the site to import cocaine and mdma from @entity132			0
catching the @entity10 in the section of the indictment outlining how the link between @entity10 and @entity10 was established , @entity55 detailed how an @entity0 expert codenamed agent - 1 had located an early online mention of @entity2 dating to january 27 , 2011 , when a user under the handle " altoid " made a post on a forum for users of magic mushrooms			1
" i came across this website called @entity2 , " wrote @entity145 , in a post which linked to the site			0
" i 'm thinking of buying off it ... let me know what you think			0
" two days later , someone using the handle " altoid " made a similar post on a forum called @entity156 , recommending @entity2 and providing a link			0
" has anyone seen @entity2 yet ? it 's kind of like an anonymous @entity60			0
i do n't think they have heroin on there , but they are selling other stuff , " it read			0
the posts , said @entity55 , were an attempt to drum up interest in @entity2 , employing the online marketing tactic of " astroturfing			0
" investigators were given a major break when , eight months later , " altoid " made another posting on @entity156 , stating he was looking for " an it pro in the @entity175 community " to hire in connection with " a venture backed @entity175 startup company			0
" the posting asked interested parties to contact rossulbricht@gmail.com			0
the indictment also noted that @entity10 and @entity10 were both vocal adherents of the libertarian theories of @entity185 economist @entity184 , with @entity10 's public @entity187 account linking to @entity189 videos posted by the @entity190 , and @entity10 repeatedly crediting @entity184 with " providing the philosophical underpinnings for @entity2			2
" from a @entity12 internet cafe @entity55 said that while @entity10 used a " virtual private network , " or @entity194 , to create a " false " ip address , the vpn server 's records indicated a user had accessed it from a @entity12 internet café near the home of a friend @entity10 had gone to live with around september last year			2
records obtained from @entity202 showed @entity10 had regularly logged into his @entity7 account from the internet café , he said -- including on the same day in june that the @entity194 was accessed			2
in july , @entity10 was visited in @entity12 by @entity206 agents who had intercepted a package from @entity208 containing fake id documents in nine different names , each bearing a photograph of @entity10			0
according to the indictment , @entity10 -- whose roommates knew him as " @entity215 , " and said he was always at home on his computer -- refused to answer questions about the @entity220 , but told the agents that " hypothetically " anyone could go on the @entity2 and purchase them			0
in the weeks prior to the encounter , said @entity55 , @entity10 had been inquiring with @entity2 users about buying fake ids , saying he needed them in order to rent extra servers for the site			1
a killing for hire ? it was not the only time @entity10 is alleged to have used the site to procure illegal services			1
@entity55 claimed that in march , @entity10 solicited the killing of a @entity2 user who was attempting to blackmail him by threatening to release the identities of thousands of users of the site			1
the @entity0 alleges that the @entity208 - based extortionist , known as @entity239 , demanded $ 500,000 to prevent the release of the information , prompting @entity10 to contact another user and order a hit on @entity239			1
" in my eyes , @entity239 is a liability and i would n't mind if he was executed , " he is alleged to have written , before attempting to haggle down the price			0
" do n't want to be a pain here , but the price seems high			0
not long ago , i had a clean hit done for $ 80k			0
" the @entity0 claims the hitman later sent a picture of the victim after the job was done -- for approximately $ 150,000 in bitcoins -- although @entity55 said @entity208 authorities had no record of a @entity208 resident with the name passed to the alleged hitman , nor any record of a homicide around that location and time			1
@entity10 's lawyer , @entity266 , declined to comment on the case			2
@entity2 's closure is unlikely to bring an end to the trade of illegal goods on the " dark web , " as similar sites operate on the @entity71 .			0
