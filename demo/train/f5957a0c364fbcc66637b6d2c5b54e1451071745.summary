@entity0 -- whether it 's an @entity5 helmet with a thicker shell and better padding , or underwear that can protect a @entity11 private 's privates , the @entity3 military is looking at sending the latest gear to @entity13 so the troops can come home safe and sound			1
next month , the @entity5 is going to start sending the " ballistic boxers " to soldiers in @entity13 , and the @entity11 intend for each of their troops there to have four pairs of the " protective undergarments , " as they are formally known , before the end of the year			1
the heavy silk boxers , which look like shorts that professional cyclists wear , wo n't stop a bullet or shrapnel from an ied			1
but the silk can stop small projectiles like those kicked up by an explosion			1
" it is expected to prevent fine sands and particles that are thrown up by explosives , so that the tissue wounds are cleaner , less ragged and easier to treat , " said lt. @entity34 , a @entity35 spokesperson			0
and since the silk is treated with antimicrobial agents , the boxers help protect injured troops from wound infections			1
while it may not sound like it affords much protection , silk is actually a very strong fiber , said @entity48			1
gen. @entity49 , who heads the army office that tests and develops new protective gear			0
he noted that silk was used by medieval knights " under the mail armor " to protect against wounds from swords and other weapons			2
the @entity11 have n't actually started buying the boxers yet , but the @entity5 has chosen boxers from a company in @entity61 called @entity62 that is already making them for the @entity64 military in @entity13			1
@entity66 boxers are n't the only step the military is taking to protect the groin			0
they are testing various cups that a male soldier will wear over his genitals			0
one of the cups being considered is made of stainless steel ; another is made from high - molecular - weight polyethylene , a plastic that is lighter than @entity77 but better at stopping bullets			1
" they all basically work to slow down the fragments			0
we are looking to prevent penetration of the genitals , " said col. @entity81 , an army officer overseeing projects aimed at better protecting soldiers			0
in addition , the @entity5 and @entity11 are looking at undershorts that will have pockets that will hold @entity77 pads to protect the wearer 's femoral artery , the main blood vessel to the legs			1
while @entity77 may be the answer to protecting arteries and groins , @entity77 helmets may soon be history			0
@entity77 is a fabric that can , when arranged in multiple layers , stop most bullets			0
the @entity5 and @entity11 are working on upgrading their head protection to the @entity104 ( @entity104 )			1
the outer shell is made from the same high - molecular - weight polyethylene plastic being investigated for groin protection			2
the thicker protective shell would make the helmet lighter than the current @entity77 model			2
the @entity5 hopes to start giving those to soldiers in @entity13 by november			1
@entity5 officials recently met with counterparts from the @entity115 and @entity116 to study ways to design helmets that provide better protection from blunt force contact			1
they came away with an understanding that @entity3 military helmets are already very good			0
" @entity124 helmets and football pads are good for football ; combat helmets and combat pads are good for combat			0
and so we 're not saying anything about deficiencies in the @entity115 system , " @entity130 , a physicist who studied the helmets , said tuesday at a briefing in the @entity133			2
but a study by @entity130 at the @entity139 in @entity140 found the military helmets could be better , especially the foam padding inside the helmet			1
" we decided to change the thickness of the foams and look at the results , " @entity130 said			0
currently , @entity77 helmets come with 3/4 - inch foam pads inside			2
in recent months , the @entity5 has provided some soldiers with 1 - inch pads to make the helmet fit better			2
by adding a quarter - inch of padding , or even an eighth of an inch , " there is a very big effect " -- a 24 % reduction in force to the skull , to be exact , @entity130 said			2
but that discovery spawned other concerns			0
the @entity5 does n't have any pads that add even one - eighth - inch of padding to the current helmet , according to @entity48			2
adding even that much padding may force soldiers to move up to a larger - size helmet			1
right now about half of all soldiers wear large helmets			2
an extra-large weighs a half - pound more , and according to @entity81 , when @entity5 soldiers were asked about wearing a heavier helmet they said they do n't want it " if it 's even an ounce heavier			1
" another project in development to help protect soldiers ' heads is a sensor that keeps track of sudden shocks to the helmet			0
the wireless sensor is about the size of a silver dollar that fits inside the helmet , under the pads , and works similar to a flight data recorder in a passenger jet			0
the @entity5 plans to use the data from the sensors to help better understand what happens to a human brain exposed to sudden blunt force			0
one day , doctors in a combat hospital may be able to take the sensor for a soldier who is being treated for @entity201 injuries and download the data on the sensor and better understand what exactly the soldier was exposed to and how strong the explosion was			0
but that , like much of the other technology being tested and developed , will not be helping the troops in danger today in @entity13			1
and the @entity5 ca n't say when , if ever , some of this gear might make it to the battlefield .			0

so - called ballistic boxers to be shipped to soldiers and @entity11 in @entity13
heavy silk shorts provide better protection from *debris* kicked up by explosions
head protection also goes hi - tech to provide lighter helmets for ground troops
physicist 's study finds significant boost in head protection with thicker padding
