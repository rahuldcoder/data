@entity0 , award - winning science journalist and former @entity2 correspondent and anchor , revealed in a blog post that his left arm was amputated recently after an accident			1
" i wish i had a better story to tell you about why i am typing this with one hand ( and some help from @entity12 ) , " he wrote			0
the story is not , he wrote with bittersweet humor , as " entertaining " as an " out - of - control quad copter that turns on its master , " or perhaps a shark attack or assassination attempt			0
what led to the loss of @entity0 's arm was a case of tv gear			1
on february 12 , he was stacking cases onto a cart after a reporting trip to @entity26 and the @entity27 , and one of them fell on his left forearm			2
" it hurt , but i was n't all ' 911 ' about it			0
it was painful and swollen but i figured it would be okay without any medical intervention			0
maybe a little bit of denial ? " @entity0 wrote			1
his arm seemed sore and swollen the next day , but did n't appear worse			2
that night , though , he experienced greater pain and swelling , and the next day asked the hotel where he was to refer him to a doctor			2
the doctor told @entity0 he may be experiencing acute compartment syndrome			1
this condition involves increased pressure in a muscle compartment , according to the @entity48			1
muscles in the arms and legs are separated from each other by thick layers of tissue called fascia , and each fascia has space in it , called a compartment , with muscle tissue , nerves and blood vessels			2
when there is swelling in a compartment , pressure in that area will increase and press on the muscles , blood vessels and nerves			0
" if this pressure is high enough , blood flow to the compartment will be blocked , " according to the @entity48 's @entity74 resource			1
" this can lead to permanent injury to the muscle and nerves			0
if the pressure lasts long enough , the muscles may die and the arm or leg will not work any more			0
it may need to be amputated			0
" symptoms of severe cases of compartment syndrome include skin paleness , numbness , tingling , decreased sensation , weakness and severe worsening pain			1
early diagnosis and treatment are key for a good recovery			1
amputee pilot : @entity0 could return to flying ' in no time ' patients need immediate surgery , which involves making long cuts through the muscle tissue to relieve pressure			1
@entity0 's doctor recommended this procedure , also known as a fasciotomy			1
after entering surgery , @entity0 woke up to learn that his blood pressure had dropped during the procedure			1
to save him , the doctor had made the decision to amputate just above the elbow			1
" he later told me it all boiled down to a choice ... between a life and a limb , " @entity0 wrote			2
since then , @entity0 has dealt with " phantom pain , the vicissitudes of daily life with one hand and the worries about what lies ahead , " he wrote			2
but he says he is grateful to be alive and urged readers not to worry			0
@entity0 , who covered the @entity121 space program for @entity2 , currently lives in @entity122 and focuses on science , technology and aerospace in his journalistic work , which includes being the science correspondent for @entity128			2
his website says he frequently pilots his own airplane to assignments			0
he ended his blog post poignantly : " life is all about playing the hand that is dealt you			0
actually , i would love somebody to deal me another hand right about now -- in more ways than one			0
" artificial hand lets amputee feel objects			0
