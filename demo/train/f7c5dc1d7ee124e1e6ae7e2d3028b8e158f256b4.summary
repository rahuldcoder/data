-- conservationists have found a new population of orangutans in a steep , mountainous corner of @entity5 -- a discovery that significantly adds to the number of the endangered red - haired primates			1
the orangutans were discovered in a mountainous corner of @entity5			1
about 65,000 orangutans are thought to remain in the wild , limited to rain forests on two islands in @entity15 and @entity5 : @entity16 and @entity17			1
the latest population was found in the eastern edge of @entity16 , with conservationists counting 219 nests			1
even by conservative estimates , that raises the total number of the orangutan population by at least a couple of hundred , maybe thousands			1
" we rarely have something positive to report in the conservation world			0
most of the stories are about declining population or animals dying			2
it 's all pretty negative , " said @entity33 , a senior ecologist with the @entity35 - based @entity34			2
" so to find a substantial population of potentially several hundred to several thousand animals is very exciting			0
" locals in the area had long spoken of an orangutan population in the hard - to - access limestone mountains of the @entity45 province			1
a group of conservationists reached the area in december after driving for a day , taking a boat for another , and then hiking across steep mountainous terrain for two , @entity33 said			0
the remoteness of the area has meant that the animals have been undisturbed by development			0
elsewhere , the orangutan 's forest habitat has been cut down for timber extraction and palm oil , used in food and cosmetics			0
orangutans , a species of great apes , with hair that is usually reddish - brown instead of the black or brown			1
the name is derived from the @entity68 and @entity69 words for " orang " ( person ) and " hutan " ( forest )			0
they spend most of their time on trees , subsisting on fruit and leading a solitary existence except to mate			0
the expedition in december found the nests crammed into just a few miles in the 2 million - acre forest			2
" the immediate steps include going back to the area to see how far the population ranges and to put better protection in place , " @entity33 said .			0
