-- inspirational music has long served to focus the mind of some of the world 's greatest sporting stars			2
retired swimming champion @entity6 swore by the grizzly bark of rapper @entity8 , while former @entity10 footballer @entity9 was known to crank out the snarling punk of the @entity12			1
for giant judo champion @entity15 , however , the motivational music of choice is something altogether more sensitive			1
" the moments before the fight , i put my headphones on to enter into the zone , " @entity17 told @entity0 's human to @entity19			2
and on his @entity28 , alongside a dollop of rap and dance music , the @entity24 confesses to getting pumped up on the power ballads of @entity30			1

but the tuneful preparation has already helped the man nicknamed the " @entity44 " shape up for spectacular success -- a long way from his early days , when he admits to being " a bit useless			2
" the 23 - year - old -- who measures in at an imposing 6 feet , 8 inches tall and weighs 282 pounds ( 128 kg ) -- is already a five - time world champion and the olympic gold medal winner at @entity48			1
he also picked up a bronze at the @entity50 of 2008 and has twice been crowned @entity51 's best			0
@entity53 roots born in the @entity24 @entity53 island of @entity55 , @entity17 was raised by his parents in @entity57			1
a self - confessed bundle of energy as a child , he was encouraged to hit the tatami ( judo mats ) at a small club in the city			1
given his sheer size and athleticism , he was a natural and soon fell in love with the sport			1
the goal of achieving " ippon " -- the fight - ending maximum score a judoka receives when a move that flips or throws an opponent onto their back is executed -- was a source of particular pleasure for the young @entity17 " before judo i did many other sports , " he explains			1
" i did tennis , basketball , swimming , golf ... squash , football			0
i stuck with judo because of the call to score ippon			1
" to win a fight there are rules , a technique			0
the two shoulders of the opponent must touch the tatami			0
if the two shoulders touch with speed and impact on the floor , it 's ippon ( and ) it 's won			1
" disciplined approach like any athlete operating at the elite level of their chosen sport , @entity17 adheres to a strict training program that requires unwavering discipline and a robust frame of mind			1
in judo , more so than other sports , these qualities are especially valuable			1
the philosophy of self - control and respect for one 's opponent outside the arena is just as critical to master as the physical conditioning for when the fight begins			1

" ( there is ) a moral code which is similar to that which you learn from your parents			0
" you need to be strong up here , " @entity17 adds , tapping his head			0
" the opponent in front of you may be strong , tall , thin -- you have to work hard to get ippon			1
" it 's this that makes the difference , you ca n't let anything go			0
" while an array of medals and championship - winning performances suggest @entity17 has mastered both the mental and muscular side of his sport , he is quick to point out that his path to the top was far from smooth			1
" i do n't think i have a gift			0
you should have seen me when i first started , i was n't the great judoka i have become , " he says			0
" i was a bit useless			0
" " today it is true that with a lot of work and a lot of assiduousness i have succeeded in forging a good judo , a good character and an intelligence for the fight , " he adds			2
" my secret to winning , i think , is the fact that i am so determined in my training , to put myself in the red , always pushing the limits			0
" judo calling this desire to constantly improve is undoubtedly made easier with a genuine enjoyment and appreciation of the intricacies of his sport			1
@entity17 's daily training schedule consists of five hours ' intense cardio and meticulous judo work			2
but while some athletes look for distractions once away from competitive arena or training field , @entity17 remains firmly attuned to his sport			2

" sometimes we finish a training session and i 'm tired , but a few hours later i already feel like playing again			0
" for me it 's not a work or a sacrifice , it 's a game and it 's a pleasure			0
the day i no longer feel like playing on the tatami ... i 'll stop			0
" for now , the day that @entity17 hangs up his kimono seems a long way off			0
still very much in his youth and operating at a level few of his peers can match , there seems little capable of subduing this @entity189 of the mats or his hunger for success			0
" what motivates me is winning medals , reaching the top of my sport , " he says			2
" i have my mentality , i have my way of being , i have my personality which makes me a fighter			0
i am a real fighter , and i love that			0
