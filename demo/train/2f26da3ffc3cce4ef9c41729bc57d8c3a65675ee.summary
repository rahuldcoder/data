@entity0 -- several unions endorsed the two - week - old @entity5 movement and plan to join the protesters ' street theater in @entity0 on wednesday , labor leaders said			1
" it 's really simple			2
these young people on @entity15 are giving voice to many of the problems that working people in @entity20 have been confronting over the last several years , " @entity9 , international president of the @entity10 , which has 20,000 member in the @entity0 area , told @entity1			1
" these young people are speaking for the vast majority of @entity20 who are frustrated by the bankers and brokers who have profited on the backs of hard - working people , " @entity9 added in a statement			0
" while we battle it out day after day , month after month , the millionaires and billionaires on @entity15 sit by -- untouched -- and lecture us on the level of our sacrifice			0
" contribute your images , video and words to @entity1 's coverage @entity41 local 100 spokesman @entity40 said the @entity5 movement , which denounces social inequities in the financial system and draws inspiration from the @entity47 revolutions in @entity48 and the @entity49 , has advanced issues that unions typically support			1
" their goals are our goals , " @entity40 said			0
" they brought a spotlight on issues that we 've believed in for quite some time now ...			2
@entity15 caused the implosion in the first place and is getting away @entity60 - free while workers , transit workers , everybody , is forced to pay for their excesses			0
" these young folks have brought a pretty bright spotlight , " @entity40 added			0
" it 's kind of a natural alliance			2
" just who are these people ? president @entity70 of the @entity71 , the sole bargaining agent for most non-supervisory @entity0 public teachers with 200,000 members , said he was " proud " to support the occupy demonstrators , who have been camping out in @entity0 and elsewhere across the nation			1
" the way our society is now headed it does not work for 99 % of people , so when @entity5 started ... they kept to it and they 've been able to create a national conversation that we think should have been going on for years , " @entity70 said			1
the labor officials could n't provide a projection on how many of their members will take the day off from work wednesday and join the protests			1
the demonstrators have bivouacked in the park in @entity0 's @entity93 , calling for 20,000 people to flood the area for a " few months			1
" the protest campaign -- which uses the hashtag # occupywallstreet on the microblogging site @entity99 -- began in july with the launch of a simple campaign website calling for a march and a sit - in at the @entity104			0
over the past two weeks , demonstrations have addressed various issues , including police brutality , union busting and the economy , the group said			1
occupy @entity15 is a leaderless movement made largely of twentysomethings upset with the state of the economy , the state of the war in @entity117 , the state of the environment , and the state of @entity20 and the world in general			2
view a gallery of high - resolution photos from the protests in less than three weeks , the movement has become a magnet for countless disaffected americans at a time when an overwhelming majority of @entity20 adults say the country 's on the wrong track			1
occupy protests have been held in @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136			0
@entity5 and its offshoots have clear strains of liberal economic populism -- a powerful force in @entity20 history during various times characterized by growing economic stress			1
that said , it could be a mistake to label or tie the movement to a specific agenda , said @entity148 , a @entity149 sociology professor			2
" it 's difficult to classify a social protest movement early on in its history , " @entity148 told @entity1			1
" clearer goals could eventually emerge , but there 's no guarantee			2
" " many movements fizzle out			0
others become more organized , " she said			0
but " i think we run a risk ( by ) taking a snapshot at any one point in time , and trying to categorize the movement in any one way based on that snapshot			0
the only way to study these protest movements is to follow them over time			0
