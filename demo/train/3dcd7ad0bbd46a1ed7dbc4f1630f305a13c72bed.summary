for more than two decades , @entity0 kept silent about his role as one of the original @entity5 code talkers responsible for developing an unbreakable code during @entity7 his death wednesday at his home in @entity10 , @entity11 , at age 93 was lamented by the @entity13 as the end of an era -- for both the country and its armed forces			1
" we mourn his passing but honor and celebrate the indomitable spirit and dedication of those @entity13 who became known as the @entity5 code talkers , " the @entity13 said in a statement			1
@entity24 was the last remaining of the original 29 @entity5 recruited by the @entity13 to develop the legendary code that was used for vital communications during battle			1
he was a teenager when he was recruited in 1942 and assigned with the other code talkers to the @entity13 ' 382nd platoon at @entity31			2
together , they created a code , including developing a dictionary			0
military authorities chose @entity5 as a code language because its syntax and tonal qualities were almost impossible for a non-navajo to learn , and it had no written form			1
the ranks of the @entity5 code talkers swelled to more than 300 by the end of the war in 1945			1
the code talkers were forbidden from telling anyone about it -- not their fellow @entity13 , not their families -- until their work was declassified in 1968			0
the original 29 were presented with the @entity50 in 2001 by president @entity51			0
" in developing our code , we were careful to use everyday @entity5 words , so that we could memorize and retain the words easily , " @entity24 told @entity52 in 2011 while promoting his book " @entity54			1
" " i think that made our job easier , and i think it helped us to be successful in the heat of battle			0
" still , @entity24 said he worried every day that an error might cost the life of an @entity67 military service member			2
@entity24 was among the code talkers who were shipped out to @entity70 in 1942 , where the code talkers worked in teams of two , with one relaying and receiving messages while the other cranked the portable radio and listened for errors in transmission			1
" that was my first combat experience , and there was a lot of suffering and a lot of the condition was real bad out there , " he told @entity52 's @entity80 in 2002			0
@entity24 also fought in @entity88 and @entity89			1
" when bombs dropped , generally we code talkers could n't just curl up in a shelter , " @entity24 wrote in his book			1
" we were almost always needed to transmit information , to ask for supplies and ammunition , and to communicate strategies			0
and after each transmission , to avoid @entity101 fire , we had to move			0
" the code talkers faced initial resistance from fellow @entity13 who did not understand who they were and what they were doing			0
that changed once they understood the importance of the code , @entity24 said			1
the @entity5 code baffled the @entity101 , who had successfuly deciphered codes used by the @entity114			1
after the war , the @entity101 chief of intelligence , lt. general @entity117 , admitted they were never able to crack the @entity5 code used by the @entity13 and @entity121 , according to the @entity121			2
@entity0 was discharged in 1945 , but later volunteered to fight in the @entity122			0
after the code talkers ' exploits were declassified by the military , the group gained legendary status with books and , ultimately , a movie that was inspired by their stories			0
" the recognition of the code talkers came late , but it has been good for my @entity5 people			1
i hope that this type of recognition continues across cultures , " @entity24 said			2
the 2002 film " @entity141 , " starring @entity139 and @entity140 , followed the fictional account of two @entity13 assigned to protect two code talkers during the battle of @entity145			0
" i could understand when they sent the message and received on the other end , " @entity24 said			2
" i could understand , and i could sit there and write it down myself			0
" it was a far cry from his childhood , when he was forced to attend a boarding school and punished by the teachers for speaking @entity5 , according to his book			1
it 's a language , though , that appears lost even to many members of his own family			0
" my own children do not speak @entity5 , although my daughter - in - law ... speaks it well , " he said			2
@entity24 said he decided to tell his story because he wanted to share the contributions and sacrifices of the @entity5 during @entity7 " our @entity5 code was one of the most important military secrets of @entity7 the fact that the @entity13 did not tell us @entity5 men how to develop that code indicated their trust in us and in our abilities , " he said			1
" the feeling that i could make it in both the white world and the @entity5 world began there , and it has stayed with me all of my life			2
for that i am grateful			0
" the @entity183 's flags have been ordered lowered in @entity24 's honor , president @entity181 said			2
people we have lost in 2014			0

as a child , @entity24 was punished for speaking @entity5
@entity24 says recognition as a code talker came late , but was good when it did
@entity24 was one of 29 @entity5 recruited to develop the code
@entity24 served as a code talker in the battles of @entity70 , @entity88 and @entity89
