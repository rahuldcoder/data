@entity0 -- when @entity3 says he once hit rock bottom , he means it			1
" i had a heroin overdose			1
i stopped breathing for too long , and i died			1
my heartbeat stopped and brain waves stopped , " he said			1
" they had to jump - start me with the paddles			2
" the 2006 episode finally persuaded @entity3 to kick his deadly drug habit			2
but getting clean -- and staying clean -- was a daunting proposition			2
" i 'd tried to get sober many times , " the 34 - year - old said			1
" i tried the methadone clinic , i tried just cold turkey			2
but ... you need to fill the void with something			2
" he tried 12 - step meetings , but they depressed him			2
so when his girlfriend told him about @entity24 , a sober support community that offers free athletic activities , he agreed to check it out			1
" i reluctantly went , thinking it was just going to be a big waste of time , " he said			2
" turns out it was the best move i ever made in my life			2
" @entity24 , named after the mythical bird that rises from its ashes , helped @entity3 rediscover his love of biking			1
it also connected him with other recovering addicts who wanted to be active			1
" they just make sure that you 're staying sober and having fun doing it , " he said			1
" it 's the best support crew i could imagine having			1
" more than 4,700 people have participated in @entity42 , which @entity43 started in 2007			2
most join the group because they 've struggled with drug or alcohol addiction			2
" life should be better once you get sober , " said @entity43 , 38			1
" ( we want to ) help people build a new life , a new self - image and have fun without getting high			2
" @entity43 developed his approach through hard - won personal experience			2
he started drinking when he was just 10 years old			2
by 15 , he was using cocaine			2
his addictions intensified after college			1
one night , after a bender , he woke up on the bathroom floor			2
" suddenly it dawned on me that if i did n't change things , i was going to overdose and that was going to be how my mother would find me , " he said			0
he decided to give it all up for good			0
but that meant abandoning his entire social network , as everyone he knew was involved in drinking and drugs			0
" overnight , your friends are gone , you 're alone , " he remembers			0
" it was a depressing first three months of recovery			0
" eventually @entity43 started working out at a boxing gym , and he later got involved with triathlons and climbing			0
these new activities kept him busy , and they also made him feel good			0
" you start to believe you can succeed in whatever you do , whether that 's your sobriety or ... crossing the finish line , " he said			0
but for @entity43 , the most important factor was that many of the people he met through these activities were sober			1
with these friendships , he built a new support system			1
" it was surrounding myself with a group of people that would rather get up at 7 in the morning to climb a mountain than to stay up until 7 in the morning drinking and using , " he said			1
" with influences like that , i just moved further away from the darkness of my addiction			0
" do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2013 @entity103 in 2005 , during a climbing trip , @entity43 realized that @entity105 had passed and he had n't given so much as a thought to drugs or alcohol			1
he decided he wanted to share what he 'd learned with others			0
a year later , @entity24 began offering programs in @entity112 , @entity113			1
@entity24 offers around 50 programs every week , ranging from casual walks and yoga to mountain biking and ice climbing			1
activities are led by field instructors , all of whom are in recovery and happy to show beginners the ropes			0
the organization provides the gear and also offers grants to help people purchase their own equipment			0
nearly all events -- with the exception of overnight activities or ski trips -- are free			0
" it 's a great way to introduce people into something that then later becomes ... sort of their coping mechanism , as opposed to picking up a drink or a drug , " @entity43 said			0
he notes that @entity24 is n't a substitute for any other recovery support program ; in fact , many in the group are also in 12 - step programs			1
but @entity43 believes the natural " high " that people get from @entity24 activities can be transformative			1
" just getting the blood pumping again -- for a lot of our folks , it 's been a long time since that 's happened , " he said			0
" the physical effects of exercise translate to your work , your family life , your belief in yourself			0
" anyone who has been sober for 48 hours is welcome to come to one of @entity24 's open sessions to participate in an activity and learn about the group			1
after attending several events , individuals are invited to join , provided they sign a pledge to treat everyone respectfully and stay sober			1
some members are hard - core athletes , but the group welcomes people of all fitness levels			0
most participants have never been active			1
@entity24 is now in four locations in @entity113 : @entity112 , @entity177 , @entity0 and @entity178 , where the organization does outreach with veterans and active - duty military personnel			1
@entity43 would like to expand beyond @entity113 later this year , and he hopes @entity24 will one day become a national program			1
already , members can often be seen in their red - and - black @entity24 jerseys at competitions around the country			1
by being open about their sobriety , @entity43 hopes they 're helping to reduce the stigma of addiction			1
" there 's so much camaraderie , people often come up and ask us how they can join our club , " he said			0
" we 're having fun , and we 're proud of being sober			1
" @entity3 's pride in his sobriety is easy to spot			0
he sports tattoos on each finger to spell out " @entity202			0
" " i was proud to be @entity3 the heroin addict , " he said			0
" when i stopped , i was just plain old boring @entity3 , i thought			0
... now i get my self - confidence by being able to go out and run a marathon or riding my bike for 100 miles			0
i like having that identity , as the guy that can do endurance sports			0
" now married , @entity3 wants to set a good example for his 10 - month - old son old by graduating from college			0
just recently , he got a new tattoo to cover up one that he got when he was using			0
the design ? a colorful phoenix			0
for him , the symbolism means a lot			0
" anytime i look down and see ( it ) , it 's rising , so ... no more muttering around , " he said			0
" life is way too short to waste it doing drugs			0
