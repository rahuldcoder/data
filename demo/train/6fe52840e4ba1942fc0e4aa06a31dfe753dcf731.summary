-- a racially - charged word with many meanings may be at the root of a dispute between two sports rivals that reaches far beyond the soccer field , analysts say			1
@entity9 's @entity8 , who is black , says the word @entity12 @entity11 shouted repeatedly during a match last month was a racial slur			1
@entity8 demanded that @entity11 be held accountable for the controversial exchange , which erupted as authorities investigate other accusations of racism in soccer			1
@entity11 , a striker for @entity20 , has n't specified what he said , but he argues that it was n't offensive			1
" i did n't insult him			0
it was only a form of expressing myself			0
i called him something his own teammates from @entity28 call him , " @entity11 said , according to the @entity12 newspaper @entity29			1
@entity31 media reports have suggested @entity11 used the @entity33 word " negrito			1
" if that 's the case , whether @entity11 's remark was racist is a complicated question that does n't have a black - and - white answer , according to scholars who 've studied race issues in @entity40			1
leading figures call on soccer chief to step down " it 's about questions of translation or context , " said @entity43 , director of the @entity44 at the @entity45			1
the word 's literal translation is " little black man			1
" but generally , negrito is not considered a racial slur in @entity40 , @entity43 said			1
in fact , it frequently has a positive meaning			0
" it 's often a term of endearment , " he said			1
but what the word means also depends on where -- and how -- it 's said			1
" in @entity65 , it has one meaning			0
in @entity72 it has a slightly different connotation and in the @entity74 it has a slightly different connotation , " said @entity67 , director of the @entity68 at @entity69 in @entity70			0
blatter a controversial figure @entity67 said his mother and stepfather , both of whom were light - skinned , frequently used the word			1
" when they talked as a couple , my mother would say , ' negrito , i love you			1
' ... i grew up listening to those expressions commonly being used by a lot of people in my community in @entity65			0
and it was never associated with any color , " he said			0
after he moved to the @entity93 in the 1960s , @entity67 said , the word took on a different meaning			2
many of his acquaintances used racial nicknames , he said , but there was no harm intended			2
" it was always more like a quick way of acknowledging the distinctiveness of that person in a very friendly way , " he said			0
but @entity67 said one of his @entity72 colleagues in graduate school who employed the word drew criticism			2
" when he used it and other people heard it , people came to me to complain			0
... in the @entity93 , it sounds offensive to some people , " @entity67 said			0
in @entity12 , the meaning is clear , said @entity93 radio talk show host @entity119 , who originally hails from the @entity122 country			0
" it 's not a slur whatsoever , " said @entity119 , whose show often addresses racism in the @entity126 community			1
" it 's a term of endearment			1
you definitely would not use that if you were angry			0
" @entity134 comments spark @entity136 storm several scholars said the word 's meaning could be connected with complicated racial politics in different @entity40 countries , which each had unique historical experiences with colonization and the slave trade			1
@entity12 , @entity67 noted , has a smaller population of @entity147 descendants than some other @entity40 nations			0
in 2006 , about 9 % of the population declared " afro or black " roots , according to @entity12 's @entity151			2
" if i were of @entity147 descent and someone from that part of the world was to use the word toward me , i would probably think twice about what the intentions are , whereas if the person who was saying it was from @entity72 you 'd probably take it as a joke			2
and if you said it to a @entity65 , they 'd just love it , " @entity67 said			0
using the word negrito to describe @entity93 president @entity169 got a @entity171 government official into hot water in 2009			1
then - foreign minister @entity173 was forced to resign after he called @entity169 a " negrito who does not know where ( the @entity171 capital of ) @entity177 is			2
" but analysts said without hearing exactly what @entity11 shouted in the october football match , or how he said it , it 's impossible to know what he meant			1
" it 's a very interesting case			2
it will be interesting to see if the @entity187 actually consults experts on this , " @entity43 said			2
" if you want to charge someone with racism or making a racial slur , the person should at least have the intent of making a slur			1
it 's not necessarily clear that @entity11 had that intent			1
" the association said wednesday that it was charging @entity11 , but did not provide details about what transpired			1
" it is alleged that @entity11 used abusive and / or insulting words and / or behavior towards @entity9 's @entity8 contrary to @entity187 rules , " the association said in a statement			1
" it is further alleged that this included a reference to the ethnic origin and / or color and / or race of @entity8 , " the statement said			1
@entity20 said in a statement that the club expects @entity11 to request a personal hearing on the issue and " remains determined to clear his name of the allegation made against him by @entity8			1
" in a post on his @entity221 page shortly after the october match , @entity11 said the accusations of racism upset him			1
" i can only say that i have always respected and respect everybody , " he said			0
" we are all the same			0
i go to the field with the maximum ( enthusiasm ) of a little child who enjoys what he does , not to create conflicts			0
" @entity8 , in an interview with @entity236 's @entity235 , said evidence would support his claim			1
you can see him say a certain word to me at least 10 times			2
there is no place for that in 2011 , " he said			0
issues of racism have repeatedly surged on the soccer field in recent years , despite efforts to combat it			0
@entity253 and @entity255 captain @entity254 is at the center of a investigation by @entity259 's @entity258 and the @entity187 after allegedly making racist remarks to @entity262 defender @entity261 during an october game			2
former @entity265 defender @entity264 walked off the field during a @entity268 league match in june after a banana was thrown at him from the stands , while the @entity271 @entity187 was forced to apologize to @entity253 in july when their @entity273 midfielder @entity272 was subject to racial slurs during a pre-season encounter			2
but @entity277 president @entity134 told @entity0 this week that he believes there is no on - field racism in the sport			0
" maybe one of the players towards the other , he has a word or a gesture which is not the correct one			2
but also , the one who is affected by that , he should say , ' it 's a game			2
' we are in a game			0
at the end of the game , we shake hands , this can happen , because we have worked so hard against racism and discrimination , " he said			0
@entity134 's comments provoked an immediate response from some players , including @entity9 's @entity299 , @entity261 's brother			2
" your comments on racism are so condescending ( it 's ) almost laughable			0
if fans shout racist chants but shake our hands is that ok ? " he wrote in a @entity136 post			0
@entity134 later took to @entity136 to explain his comments , posting : " sometimes , in the heat of the moment , things are said and done on the field of play which are wrong			0
this does not mean that , in general , there is racism on the field of play			0
football unites people more than it divides them			0
" @entity0 's @entity321 contributed to this report .			0
