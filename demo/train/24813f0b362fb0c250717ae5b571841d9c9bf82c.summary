@entity0 the scandal enmeshing @entity4 president @entity3 already had a plot as twisted as a @entity7 novel			1
but this week , it contorted again , when the country 's former spy chief disappeared			1
@entity11 was supposed to testify thursday about the mysterious death of a special prosecutor , who had leveled scathing accusations at @entity16			1
authorities have not been able to find the ex-director of the secretary of intelligence , let alone notify him that he has been called to testify			1
the intrigue surrounding him , the dead prosecutor and the president dates back to 1994 -- when a car bomb demolished a @entity25 center in @entity0 , killing 85 people			1
special prosecutor @entity27 implicated @entity28 in the attack , in his nearly 300 - page investigation report			1
then he accused @entity16 of covering up @entity32 's involvement to sweeten a trade deal			1
cash - strapped @entity4 would allegedly get @entity28 oil in exchange for meat and grain			2
shortly after filing his report and one day before he was to testify before lawmakers about his allegations in january , @entity27 was found dead in his apartment with a gunshot wound to the head			1
in his trash can , investigators found a draft warrant for @entity16 's arrest			0
the president was quick to call it a suicide but changed her story a few days later			2
a test found no gunpowder residue on @entity27 's hands , as would have been expected if he had pulled the trigger			0
@entity16 's government blamed the intelligence agency for his death , and the president filed a bill for the agency to be dissolved and replaced by the new @entity62			1
the @entity63 took up debate on the bill on wednesday			0
supporters hope to have it on @entity69 's desk to sign by february 25			0
and she pointed the finger at @entity72 , accusing him of feeding @entity27 false information and having a hand in his death			2
@entity11 was using @entity27 to discredit her for firing @entity11 last year , she claimed			0
but @entity11 's replacement , @entity77 , reeled him back in -- not as an agent , but as a witness			0
on thursday , the director said @entity16 would relieve @entity11 of his pledge of secrecy			0
" the president of the nation has given us the directive and now we are going to work on preparing the authorization to relieve mr. @entity11 of the obligation to keep secrets , " @entity77 said			2
though now allowed to testify , @entity11 ca n't been found			2
@entity90 reported from @entity0 ; and @entity91 from @entity92			0
@entity1 's @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 contributed to this report			0
