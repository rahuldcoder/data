@entity0 , @entity1 -- it was not a quiet weekend for the prime minister of @entity1 , facing a diplomatic test abroad from @entity6 and questions at home about his leadership			1
sitting down with @entity2 -- his first interview with an international television network -- prime minister @entity14 answered wide - ranging questions from pressing economic issues leading up to the upcoming @entity18 ( @entity18 ) summit , to the diplomatic challenges from economic superpower @entity6			1
@entity14 is a leader looking for a path out of a maze of domestic and international hurdles			1
he faces the monetary monster that is the sharply rising yen , that 's prompting corporations like @entity26 and @entity27 to push production and jobs outside of @entity1			1
diplomatically , he is in the middle of a major test with @entity6 , a country wielding growing strength in the world economy , and a superpower that 's just surpassed @entity1 in economic might			2
@entity1 is in an ongoing dispute with @entity6 over islands in the @entity38			2
the islands , called @entity40 in @entity1 and @entity40 in @entity6 , are claimed as territories by both countries			2
" as far as @entity1 is concerned , " said @entity14 , " there is no territorial issue connected to the @entity40 islands			2
in fact , the @entity40 islands are the inherent territory of @entity1			0
that is recognized in our history and also by international law			0
" on september 7 , the @entity1 coast guard encountered a @entity6 fishing crew in the islands ' waters			0
the @entity6 fishing vessel collided with two of the coast guard ships			0
@entity1 arrested the @entity6 crew , quickly releasing the fishermen , but detaining the captain			0
his detention drew diplomatic fire from @entity6 , resulting in the cancellation of high - level ministerial meetings , most recently the abrupt cancellation of a scheduled meeting between @entity14 and @entity6 prime minister @entity68 at the @entity69			1
@entity1 eventually released the captain , but relations continue to be strained			0
at the time of the september 7 incident , the @entity1 coast guard captured both collisions on video			0
the video , deemed highly sensitive by the prime minister 's office as it sought a smooth diplomatic out with @entity6 , was not released to the public , but shown to a select group of parliamentary lawmakers			1
last friday , the video appeared on @entity83 and quickly went viral , sending prime minister @entity14 's office on the diplomatic defensive			1
members of the prime minister 's own party publicly began to question his handling of the matter			1
" the fact that the video was leaked is a big mistake for the government , " said legislator @entity92 , of the prime minister 's ruling @entity93			1
" it is totally different from presenting it to the public in an official manner , and it leads ( to ) the people 's further erosion of faith in @entity1 's government			2
" in the weekend interview with @entity2 , the prime minister defended his actions			1
" i believe in any country that matters that relate to its territory provoke strong sentiments among people of that country			0
but i trust five years , 10 years down the road , people then will appreciate my cabinet dealt with the issue in a calm manner			0
" while the prime minister must try to contain the diplomatic damage with @entity6 , the most pressing matter in the week leading up to the @entity18 will be economic issues			1
@entity14 strongly defended his government 's right to intervene in the currency market , in attempts to weaken the yen 's sharp rise against the @entity134 dollar			1
@entity1 had little choice , he suggested , since @entity134 policy has been to boost the @entity134 economy			0
" with regard to the strong yen , the basic cause is the @entity134 economy was undergoing changes with everything being skewed to a weak dollar , " said @entity149 " should there be excessive fluctuations in exchange markets , then we need to take resolute actions			0
in fact , we 've already intervened in the market once			0
this remains an option we can take again			0
" how long @entity14 remains in his job is a constant question lobbed publicly by many pundits in @entity1			2
the topic is a natural one , as there have been five @entity1 prime ministers in four years			1
prime minister @entity14 asserted he 's shown leadership and results , producing a rare - earth minerals partnership with @entity164 and the deepening of an economic pact with @entity167			1
" as we move forward by achieving concrete results , one after another , these will become more visible to the @entity1 people			0
i still have three more years in my term in office			0
if i firmly implement policies , i trust i will be able to have the support of the @entity1 people , " @entity14 said .			2
