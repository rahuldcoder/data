-- @entity1 struck a major blow in the @entity4 title race with a controversial 2 - 1 victory over champions @entity6 on saturday that put the @entity8 club two points clear at the top of the table with five matches to play			1
@entity14 's team traveled to @entity15 to face a side reeling from the loss of injured @entity19 star @entity18 following the midweek @entity21 defeat by @entity22			2
the @entity24 coach opted to leave his own key forward @entity25 on the substitutes ' bench , but the @entity29 international scored a decisive goal with 11 minutes to play despite being clearly offside			2
@entity6 boss @entity31 was left fuming at the decision			0
" what i ca n't understand is the linesman 's directly in front of it			0
he has no - one near him and he gets it wrong , " the @entity37 told @entity38			0
" a game of that magnitude , you really need quality officials and we did n't get them today			0
it was a poor , poor performance			0
" five games left , they 're two points ahead and four goals better than us -- they 're in the driving seat			0
@entity1 are favorites now , there 's no question			2
i 'm certain we 'll respond but we could win the next five games and not win it			0
" @entity6 hit back with a late bundled goal from young substitute @entity58 , which television replays showed came off the @entity24 's arm , but @entity63 striker @entity62 could not convert a chance to equalize in time added on			1
@entity1 , who had scored 12 goals in the two previous matches and did not have to play in midweek following last month 's @entity21 exit against @entity70 , started the game in dominant form			2
man of the match @entity73 set up the opening goal in the 20th minute , with the @entity76 winger surging past @entity77 into the penalty area and providing a low cross that @entity19 midfielder @entity80 cheekily backheeled past goalkeeper @entity81			0
both teams had penalty claims turned down before halftime , and @entity62 missed @entity6 's first real chance with a header after an hour			2
@entity25 replaced @entity87 in the 69th minute , and 10 minutes later he had the ball in the net after collecting a pass from fellow substitute @entity91 despite being further forward than @entity6 's last two defenders			1
@entity6 pulled a goal back with nine minutes to play as substitute @entity94 broke down the left and his cross rebounded off goalkeeper @entity97 , onto @entity58 and into the @entity1 net , with visiting captain @entity99 appealing in vain for handball			1
@entity62 , who started on his own up front in place of @entity18 , then tamely volleyed @entity105 's cross into the arms of @entity97 as @entity1 held on for a deserved victory			2
third - placed @entity108 kept their title hopes alive with a last - gasp 1 - 0 victory at 10 - man @entity111 which left @entity113 's team three points behind @entity8 rivals @entity1			1
wolves had captain @entity117 sent off for a foul on @entity119 in the 66th minute , but @entity108 could not take advantage until deep into injury - time when substitute striker @entity121 headed in @entity123 's cross			1
@entity124 moved up to fourth place above @entity126 with a 6 - 1 thrashing of @entity128 in saturday 's late match that left their near neighbors deep in relegation trouble			2
@entity133 's team were 4 - 0 up after 20 minutes , and led 6 - 0 before an hour had been played as @entity134 scored twice along with goals from fellow strikers @entity136 and @entity138			1
@entity139 and @entity140 were also on target before @entity143 's 71st - minute consolation for the home side			0
@entity126 's hopes of qualifying for the @entity21 took a big blow with a 3 - 1 defeat at @entity148 , for whom the @entity8 club 's former striker @entity149 scored twice -- the first after only 36 seconds and the second from the penalty spot			1
@entity19 @entity155 hopeful @entity149 also had two spot - kicks saved by @entity126 goalkeeper @entity157 as he took his tally to 23 for the season			0
@entity148 also had a goal disallowed as @entity162 's team consolidated 13th place , a comfortable 11 points clear of the bottom three			1
@entity166 bounced back from the 7 - 1 thrashing at @entity1 with a 1 - 0 win at @entity169 to join sixth - placed @entity170 -- who travel to @entity172 on sunday -- on 54 points			1
@entity19 international @entity174 fired an 11th - minute winner to leave @entity169 five points above the relegation zone			0
@entity178 moved up to 10th with a 2 - 0 victory that left @entity180 in the bottom three , equal on points with @entity182 , who travel to @entity184 on sunday			1
@entity186 forward @entity185 gave @entity178 a sixth - minute lead , and @entity180 were reduced to 10 minutes after @entity189 midfielder @entity188 was carried off after being kicked in the head before @entity191 scored a late second			0
bottom club @entity193 delayed their inevitable relegation with a 0 - 0 draw at home to @entity197 despite having defender @entity198 sent off with half an hour to play			1
@entity200 's team would have gone down if they had lost and @entity180 had won .			0
