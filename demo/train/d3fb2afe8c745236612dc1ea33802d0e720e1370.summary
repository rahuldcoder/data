-- that 's the argument @entity3 made in the @entity4 on thursday : that our hypermetabolic , @entity6 - fueled media culture allowed the remarks from @entity11 's crew to spread so far and so fast , @entity1 had almost no choice but to relieve him			1
think of it as information blitzkrieg			1
" fast , overwhelming , decisive : it 's a case study in how tightly connected 21st - century media can whip a story into a full - on tsunami , with startling consequences for individual careers and national policy ... @entity22 , a nonresident fellow at the @entity23 and a blogger at @entity0 , says : ' the fact so many of us are networked together enabled the information to spread speed - of - light fast			1
that turned what might have been a slower - burning flame into an instant conflagration			1
' [ okay , okay			1
that sounds a little pretentious			2
but you get the idea -- ed. ] how fast ? the @entity37 article that started it all ... does n't hits newsstands until today			2
" obviously , the content of the story -- and the progress of the @entity43 campaign , and the political environment back home -- mattered more than the speed of the news			1
the story tapped into a lot of latent anxiety and hostility about the war in @entity43 that had n't been given an outlet yet			1
combine that with the 24 - second news cycle , and ... well , you see the results			2
update : @entity61 ace and @entity6 fanatic @entity58 does n't buy the @entity4 's argument			2
" every reporter in the @entity65 news room , and many beyond , had a copy of the @entity37 article by late monday night			2
i had it about 6 p.m. , which from what i read is before even @entity1 saw it , yes ? then at about 10 p.m. i got a copy of the @entity11 apology from @entity76 which was even more stunning than the article for its total lack of a denial			0
so before most of @entity81 went to bed not knowing anything of it , we were already doing reporting on it , and writing -- with a few posting it , obviously			0
before i finished my morning joe ( lowercase ) i saw @entity91 news ' @entity89 's @entity6 that the @entity92 had summoned @entity93 to the flagpole , which hit every cable station about a millisecond later			0
then the story went viral , " he e-mails @entity97			1
" i love @entity6 , but it was n't the golden goose this time			0
" @entity101 contends the troops ' connectivity -- not just the civilians ' -- played heavily into @entity11 's fall			1
" frontline troops nowadays are also online troops			1
they are plugged in to the @entity108 , to @entity109 , to blogs , to e-mail and @entity112			0
they talk to each other in chat rooms with little or no supervision from the brass			0
it 's all instant and it 's all in their face			0
and that , i hasten to add , is not a bad thing			0
it 's a good thing			0
but it makes the morale of the troops that much more fragile , that much more apt to be affected by relative trivialities			1
the fact that @entity11 , along with his ' @entity130 ' posse of adjutants , understood none of this was reason enough to send him packing			0
his ' conduct ' was n't just a disservice to his president ; it was a disservice to the men and women under his command			0
