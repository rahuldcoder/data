-- he can saw himself in half , sing a selection of @entity5 showtunes and swing on a flying trapeze			1
@entity7 says he 'll try to make viewers feel like they 're in good hands with him as @entity11 host			1
when @entity7 , one of the stars of the hit @entity14 sitcom " @entity15 , " is n't dabbling in the extraordinary , well , he 's probably hosting an awards show			1
in the late ' 80s , @entity7 -- known as @entity7 to his fans -- landed the starring role on " @entity19 , @entity20 " after years of child stardom and teen heartthrob status , @entity7 left the small screen for the stage			1
he became a respected @entity5 actor , starring in shows like " @entity28 , " " cabaret " and " @entity30 , " before returning to television			1
now , millions know @entity7 as @entity32 , the womanizing , slap - happy sidekick on " @entity15 , " which begins its fifth season september 21			1
like @entity36 and @entity37 before him , this man - of - many - talents is also making his mark as an awards show host			1
on sunday , september 20 , @entity7 will host the @entity43			1
he shares his thoughts on fate , finding balance and making out with his co-star			1
@entity48 : how are you preparing for @entity11 night ? @entity7 : i 'm just trying to make sure all the comedy host elements are in place			1
we 'll have a good opening bit and a couple surprise things throughout			1
we want to balance respecting the show and the doling out of the awards with the sort of random things that will keep the audience 's attention in other ways			1
so that 's kind of been my job			1
you want to make it unique and , yet , classic			2
that 's a tricky dynamic			2
@entity0 : planning an @entity11 party ? get 4 entertaining solutions @entity72 : i can imagine			2
how often are you rehearsing ? @entity7 : well , it 's sort of a litany of e-mails and phone calls all day with the producers			1
we had a great opening short film we are going to shoot , and it would be the first thing you shot			2
that was going to be with @entity86 , and he withdrew at the last minute			2
so that got scrapped , and we 're off to plan @entity88 , @entity89 or @entity90 it 's sort of like now you go : " that 's fantastic , great			2
we 've got that person , " or " oh , that person did n't work			2
now what do we do ? " a lot of " now what do we do ? " questions			2
@entity72 : now at the @entity99 , you sang a , may i say , legendary closing number			2
will you be singing at the @entity11 , or is dancing more the focus ? @entity7 : i suspect you wo n't see me dancing very much			1
that 's not my forte			2
but yeah , i might throw some sort of singing into it			1
i have n't quite decided			2
i sort of feel like the @entity11 are so classy and glamorous and black tie , the host really needs to respect his job title			1
i think too much " look at me ! look at me ! " as the host of a show that big is counterproductive			2
so long as i make you feel confident that you 're in good hands with me as the host , then it 's my real responsibility to introduce you to a lot of other people and elements -- other presenters who are then going to talk to you or other introductions of next sections			2
it 's not really to be a song - and - dance man			2
@entity72 : did you look back at past @entity11 hosts for inspiration ? @entity7 : very much			1
@entity131 hosted the first televised awards , which was the 7th @entity133 , in , i think , 1955 , and he was great			0
that was sort of my inspiration for all of this			0
he just had such a dry wit , a commanding voice , a great presence			0
you knew when you were watching it that if something went wrong , you could look to him , and he would steer you through it			0
it was always with great dignity and a dry sense of humor , and he was sort of out there all the time			0
he was definitely the " host			0
" he definitely helped the show , so i like that			0
@entity37 , too , was great			0
@entity72 : hypothetically , what would you do if your name was called for @entity158 this year ? @entity7 : oh my , i would graciously accept , try to keep my speech to a minimum , and then quickly set it backstage , because i have a lot more to do for the next couple hours			1
@entity72 : is the award given out early on in the show ? @entity7 : i think it will be within the first hour			1
it 's a nice and refreshing win - win for me , because if i do happen to win , it will be awesome - tastic , and oddly , a bit of a distraction			0
and if i do n't win , it just provides lots of comedy fodder for the rest of the show			0
so i 'm pretty safe either way			0
it 's a tough category , for sure			0
@entity72 : so the day after the @entity11 , a new season of " @entity15 " premieres			1
last season 's finale left us wondering if your character , @entity32 , will finally settle down and start dating @entity182			1
@entity7 : they certainly take a stab at it			1
i know there will be lots of necking and making out			0
lots of canoodling between @entity182 and i. my lips are chapped			1
they have strong physical chemistry , apparently			1
@entity72 : " @entity15 " puts a lot of stake in fate			1
are you a believer in fate ? @entity7 : i do n't know what to make of fate			1
i certainly do n't think you can predetermine things			0
it feels like if you go out of your way to try to make something happen , it rarely does			0
but if you allow for good things to happen , they seem to			0
i think a lot of that is more perception , you know ? a lot of people would take getting rear - ended in their car as an example of why their life continues to be one road block after another , and i think a different person can see that same fender bender and be grateful it was n't worse			0
that allows them an opportunity to learn something from it -- sort of take some sort of positive elements from that			0
i think if you try to angle your life in those ways , then fate , destiny , karma opens itself up to you and allows for more growth			0
@entity0 : how to get lucky in love and life @entity72 : i 'm curious , how did your father meet your mother ? @entity7 : they were college , fraternity and sorority sweethearts			1
and he was in , something @entity246 ? they did the whole , you know , he gave her his pin			0
she was pinned , and they were a couple			0
then , they were married , and they 've only been with each other			0
i 'm very extraordinarily lucky with my parents			0
... we did n't have a lot of money growing up , but we were never made to feel poor			0
they had amazing senses of humor , senses of music and really treated us like regular people when we were kids			0
@entity72 : did your parents help you survive child stardom ? @entity7 : they were definitely grounding forces during years in my life that were very tumultuous			1
they 're remarkably grounded and were not at all blinded by the light of stardom and fame			0
their main concern was just my well - being and my brother 's well - being during all of our crazy times , whether they be intimate or very public			0
