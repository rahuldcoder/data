a three - speed global economy faces risks from a currency crisis in emerging markets or unsustainable debt in the @entity5 and @entity6 , @entity8 managing director @entity7 has warned			1
speaking ahead of the @entity8 's spring meeting in @entity10 next week , ms @entity7 said that the world was dividing into three groups -- some countries doing well , some on the mend and some still in trouble			1
her speech highlights a new phase for the global economy in which the uneven pace of growth around the world is creating new financial imbalances that could sow the seeds of a future crisis			1
" we do not expect global growth to be much higher this year than last			0
we are seeing new risks as well as old risks , " ms @entity7 told an audience in @entity29 on wednesday			1
" in far too many countries , improvements in financial markets have not translated into improvements in the real economy			1
" emerging economies were growing fast , she said , but low interest rates in advanced economies were prompting them to build up debt and foreign exchange exposure that could cause trouble			2
" over the past five years , foreign currency borrowing by firms in emerging markets has risen by about 50 per cent , " said ms @entity7			1
" over the past year , bank credit has increased by 13 per cent in @entity47 and 11 per cent in @entity48			0
" she said that developing countries needed to respond by beefing up bank supervision , restricting credit to fast - growing areas , imposing capital requirements that changed with the economic cycle and monitoring their foreign exchange exposures			2
ms @entity7 endorsed quantitative easing by central banks such as the @entity59 and @entity60 , but said that rich economies should use fiscal policy more aggressively so there was less pressure for interest rates to stay low			2
countries on the mend included the @entity5 , @entity68 and @entity69 , she said			1
but she warned that the @entity5 was cutting its deficit too fast in the short term , harming growth , but tackling its long - run deficit too slowly			1
she criticised sequestration under which the @entity5 is lopping off $ 85bn from public spending this year			1
" this risks throwing away needed growth , especially at a time when too many people are still out of work , " she said			0
but she said that , despite progress on fiscal policy , government debt would hit 108 per cent of gross domestic product this year			0
" this is the major policy challenge facing the @entity5 today and it must be met			0
otherwise , the substantial gains that have been made can be too easily lost			0
" countries that still had work to do included the euro area and @entity6 , said ms @entity7			2
in the euro area , the main problem is the banking system			0
in keeping with the @entity8 's imposition of a restructuring on @entity95 banks , she said " the priority must be to continue to clean up the banking system by recapitalising , restructuring or -- where necessary -- shutting down banks			0
" in @entity6 , she warned that the public debt of 245 per cent of gdp " looks increasingly unsustainable " and that a clear plan to tackle it was an " urgent priority "			0
but @entity6 must also act " to finally break free of the deflation trap " and it needed to " rely more on monetary policy to kick - start growth " .			0
