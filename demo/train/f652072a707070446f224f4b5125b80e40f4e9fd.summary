-- thirty days of signs and signals have revealed to the world in @entity4 , a pope who seems eager to earn the title pontiff , or bridge - builder			1
beginning with his choice of a name , which evokes the beloved image of @entity10 , the former cardinal of @entity12 , @entity4 , put the world on notice that change was afoot by forgoing the fancy red slippers and ermine stole favored by other popes			1
since then he has shown a remarkable common touch in his encounters with the public and greater sensitivity to others than the man who came before him			1
try as he did , @entity4 ' immediate predecessor , @entity25 , never looked comfortable in his own skin , let alone in pastoral contact with others			1
clad in his ornate robes , he seemed to keep the world at arm 's length in a way that betrayed his long service as @entity36 's " rottweiler " ( a nickname he received from the press ) in charge of disciplining those who deviated from doctrine			0
while personally warmer , the pope before @entity25 , @entity44 , was stern when it came to religious matters and approached the world with an @entity48 mindset			2
as the church was rocked by a seemingly endless number of sex abuse scandals -- thousands of child victims and systematic cover - ups by the hierarchy -- he blamed secular society , especially the media , and capitalistic materialism			1
pope francis tasks cardinals with studying reform of @entity61 in contrast with @entity44 and @entity25 , @entity4 does n't seem capable of greeting anyone without a big , sincere smile and whenever given the choice between clerical privilege and everyday human experience , he opts for the human			1
this was demonstrated most clearly as he visited a jail during @entity71 to symbolically wash the feet of a dozen people who represented the apostles			2
among them were two women and two muslims			0
their presence , and @entity4 's ease with them , dismayed traditionalists who recoiled at the sight of females and non-catholics being included in the ritual			1
it thrilled those who hunger for a more accessible and inclusive church			2
the survivors of clerical abuse , who i have come to know during three years of writing my book " @entity96 , " hope that @entity4 will bring real change			1
however , they have been discouraged by 30 years of church evasions and counterattacks and are understandably wary			2
tough - minded evaluators , they criticize @entity4 ' record on abuse in @entity103			1
there he was among many of the world 's catholic bishops -- fully 25 % -- who failed to meet a deadline for establishing policies to deal with complaints and priests who were accused , according to the @entity113			0
victims also wait for @entity4 to demonstrate that he will discipline offenders and reveal their records			1
" we do n't think statements make kids any safer , " @entity118 leader @entity117 told me this week			0
" unless he makes kids safer , he 's not doing his job			0
" @entity125 's " show - me " attitude is echoed by her @entity118 colleague @entity127 , who was sexually abused when he attended a @entity61 boarding school in @entity130			0
@entity127 said he admires the new man 's style and sees , in his personality , reason for hope			0
@entity136 seeks to rebrand its relationship with science " @entity10 was the single greatest reformer in the history of the @entity61 , " ' noted @entity127			0
" my favorite quote by @entity10 is , ` start by doing what 's necessary ; then do what 's possible ; and suddenly you are doing the impossible			0
' confronting and reforming the church 's global system of child sex abuse and cover - up , that is doing what is necessary			1
if @entity4 does that , who knows what 's possible ? better yet , what 's impossible			1
" @entity154 , the attorney most responsible for the waves of litigation that have revealed the church 's secrets on abusive priests , is even more optimistic			2
regarded by some as the most dreaded enemy of institutional @entity162 , @entity154 told me , " this pope has already demonstrated in action and words a humility we have n't seen before			2
i see that as revolutionary and it is in direct contrast with the hubris that was the source of the abuse crisis			1
it gives me hope that he can , if he chooses to , go against the power structure and fundamentally change things			0
for today i have hope like i never had			0
" although i am also skeptical of church leaders and well aware of the hierarchy 's long - standing failure on the abuse issue , @entity4 ' first 30 days have led me to agree with @entity154 when it comes to the new pope 's personality			1
this is a shift for me , and i make it tentatively , because like all @entity61 and former @entity61 , i know we are susceptible to the influence of church stagecraft			2
we want to believe , and that desire has been exploited too often in the past			0
if @entity4 makes the changes that the church must make to end the sex abuse crisis , it will happen because he grasps and wields the power of his office			1
as a cardinal , he was bound by his oath of obedience to " go along			0
" as pope , he is the one who makes the rules and requires others to obey			0
what if one of those requirements included an open , transparent and serious program to make children safe and heal the trauma of the past 30 years ? @entity4 to @entity136 : ' act decisively ' on sex abuse cases many of history 's transformational figures have been men who , when they finally achieved power , used it in surprising ways			1
@entity217 , son of wealth and privilege , became the trust - busting enemy of corporate monopolists			0
southerner @entity222 used his considerable skills to champion civil rights			0
@entity225 , @entity226 friend of industrialists , created the @entity228			0
@entity4 has his chance now			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity232 .			2

@entity232 : pope @entity4 ' first month has shown a remarkable common touch
he says the @entity4 *connects* with people on a human level
even those leading cause of church abuse victims like what they see , he says
@entity232 : @entity4 has great opportunity to end the sex abuse crisis
