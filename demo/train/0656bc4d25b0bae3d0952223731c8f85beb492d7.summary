@entity0 -- military officials from @entity3 and its 28 member states descended on @entity0 last week for a series of discussions about rethinking how the alliance should transform itself in an era when its scope has expanded beyond traditional @entity11 boundaries			1
the seminar was hosted by former secretary of state @entity13 , who is chairing a group of experts appointed by the @entity3 secretary - general to recommend a new " @entity20 " for the alliance , governing how it perceives and responds to threats			2
the group heard from some pretty heavy hitters : @entity24 secretary of defense @entity23 and secretary of state @entity25 , and @entity3 secretary - general @entity26 , all of whom aptly acknowledged the alliance is facing a new strategic landscape with new enemies , ideologies and battle tactics that threaten its collective security			2
none of these threats were on the table 61 years ago when the @entity41 was founded			1
" security " no longer means merely fighting the enemy on a @entity44 battlefield			0
today it also means fighting the @entity47 in @entity48 , battling pirates off the coast of @entity51 , and combating cybersoldiers seeking to wreak havoc on world economies			2
@entity48 is the largest example of @entity3 undertaking such an " out of area " mission , an operation beyond the borders of its member states			1
here the track record is mixed : although @entity3 did assume control of the @entity64 in 2003 , the @entity24 has continued to complain that some @entity44 members are not pulling their weight by providing enough military support for the mission			2
the recent fall of the @entity71 government over its @entity3 troop commitments shows what a tough sell this is			0
many @entity44 are war - weary after suffering casualties and in some cases are more concerned about homegrown terrorism than about the war in @entity48			2
the @entity24 has argued that a failure by @entity3 to provide enough troops for the mission in @entity48 would call into question the alliance 's ability to tackle @entity86 security challenges			1
yet this soul - searching comes in a time of financial and budget constraints for all member countries			0
and the widening of @entity3 's scope to respond to challenges like terrorism , nuclear proliferation , piracy and cyberwarfare requires new capabilities , which means even more resources			1
since the end of the @entity11 , @entity3 has forged new partnerships which can help it share this new burden			0
in addition to the 50 - nation @entity104 and the @entity106 , where the alliance cooperates with countries in its own neighborhood , @entity3 is developing relationships with countries in the @entity112 and broader @entity113			0
and it is also strengthening ties with countries in @entity116 , like @entity117 and @entity118			0
the rise of @entity120 and @entity121 also has @entity3 thinking about partnerships with those countries			0
@entity3 's growing , though often uneasy , relationship with @entity126 could benefit its widening worldview			1
although the original tenets of @entity3 's mission -- defending member nations , strengthening trans - @entity133 ties , and fostering @entity44 integration -- still apply , @entity128 said , shared threats such as terrorism and proliferation could foster even greater cooperation with @entity126			1
as @entity3 seeks to combat threats beyond its borders , the hope is that @entity126 concerns about a missile defense shield could be eased within this new framework of " shared security " against countries like @entity148 and @entity149			1
this re-examination will call into question the invoking of @entity153 of the @entity41 , which states that an attack on one member is an attack on all members			0
the alliance invoked it for the first and only time after 9/11 -- declaring the attacks on @entity160 and @entity0 an attack against the entire alliance -- and all @entity3 countries contributed in some way to the initial @entity24 invasion of @entity48			2
and as the alliance redefines the nature of security , it is also redefining the nature of an attack			0
a few years ago @entity170 , a @entity3 ally , suffered a sustained cyberattack that shut down many of the country 's essential services			1
@entity3 was called upon to help , and now has a cyberteam that can deploy to support any @entity3 ally engaged in cyberwarfare			0
but despite the importance -- and even the necessity -- of @entity3 's " @entity20 , " its immediate future will be determined by the outcome of the war in @entity48			1
failure could cause @entity3 members to be skittish about these new " out - of - area " missions , which will more and more mean confronting the enemy on its own turf .			0

@entity3 officials rethink the alliance 's role in a world of terrorists and cyberwarfare
founded 61 years ago , @entity3 dealt with cold war era threats for most of those years
@entity48 war is @entity3 's largest " out of area " mission to date
@entity3 could benefit from its growing , but still uneasy , relationship with @entity126
