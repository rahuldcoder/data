@entity0 -- with a few masterful strokes , @entity2 turns the cuddly panda into a menacing state security agent , creating another wildly popular cartoon image across @entity8 cyberspace			1
donning an olive - green military coat and shooting red flames out of his eyes , @entity2 's character delivers a powerful kick to a subdued @entity15 superhero , who hopelessly lies on the ground with his camcorder knocked over			1
the headline screams above : " @entity19 vs. @entity21 premiere in @entity8 ; cast : @entity22 , @entity23			1
" the 38 - year - old @entity8 political cartoonist first drew the creature in december after learning of the " @entity21 " movie star 's failed attempt to visit a prominent blind @entity8 activist whose nearly 15 - months of house arrest has drawn international criticism			1
a @entity1 camera captured the scene of guards roughing up @entity22 and stopping him from entering the activist 's village			1
" it just came naturally to me when i saw footage of those guards in military coats , " @entity2 said , explaining the birth of @entity19 to @entity1 over the phone from his home in central @entity40			1
" @entity45 is a national treasure , and ' national treasure ' and ' state security ' sound the same in @entity50			0
" an instant hit with @entity8 netizens , @entity19 went viral online within a few hours , generating countless comments and inspiring colorful imitations			1
before long , however , censors -- who act on orders from government propaganda officials -- removed the image from the public feed of @entity62 , @entity8 's equivalent of @entity63			1
for @entity2 , who signs his work as " @entity68 , " such a fate for his drawing is hardly unexpected			1
the advertising illustrator - turned - political cartoonist switched careers only two years ago but already knows well the daily battle faced by what he says is a " rare breed " in @entity8			2
" i 'm a news junkie who loves drawing , and my advertising background trained me well to work under tight deadlines , " he said			0
" i do this out of passion -- and i do n't think you 'll see many people join the few of us anytime soon because of all the limits and risks			0
" @entity2 jokingly labels himself a " hardcore reincarnationist " on @entity62 , which he says has deleted his account for more than 180 times thanks to the sensitive nature of his posts			2
although his pseudonym on the site was not accessible for a while , he managed to keep signing up with different names			0
despite the censors ' best effort , @entity68 continues to thrive in cyberspace , lampooning everything ranging from @entity0 's pollution , what he sees as @entity8 's limits on religious freedom to @entity108 leader @entity107 's untimely death			1
calling any @entity110 restrictions doomed to fail , @entity2 especially enjoys interacting with like - minded peers online			2
when someone commented on the @entity22 story by tweeting , " now that @entity21 has been beaten up , the only way forward is to organize @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 and the @entity118 for a group visit , " @entity2 quickly drew a second @entity113 cartoon			1
titled " @entity19 2 : @entity131 , " the evil bear character -- still sporting his signature military coat -- strikes a classic kung fu pose while facing off against a slew of fighters for justice , including @entity21 , @entity128 and v from " @entity130			2
" " people do feel more comfortable commenting using humor rather than direct criticism , " said @entity132 , founder of @entity8 media - monitoring website danwei.org and a leading commentator on @entity8 's social media			1
" i think it 's also an expression of many absurd things that happen in @entity8 -- in some way , the only rational reaction is to laugh			2
" with more than 130,000 followers on just one of his several websites , @entity2 's rising fame online has opened doors for him to traditional media			1
a newspaper in @entity151 has hired him as a cartoonist and several liberal @entity8 publications also print his regular contributions			2
ultimately , though , he aspires to become not just a satirist but also an iconoclast			0
" sometimes my cartoons give me a sense of accomplishment , " he said			0
" but what i really want is to wake up my fellow countrymen by injecting a sense of civil society in their minds			0
@entity8 will change one day and i hope my work will help reduce the number of brainwashed citizens in the meantime			2
" this kind of lofty goal has already brought @entity2 a harsh reality check			0
after he created cartoons last year for a group of independent candidates who defied government warnings to run for seats in local legislatures , he says state security agents showed up at his door -- twice			0
" i know their bottom line , " he said			0
" if you draw mostly as a hobby , they leave you alone			0
but if you draw to rally people around a political cause , you 're crossing the line			0
" recounting his initial fear of official reprisals , @entity2 says he 's since moved on and now feels undeterred by the potential consequences of his work -- and @entity19 has n't prompted another " @entity192 " visit , yet			1
" getting such visits -- it 's like how a virgin feels about having sex , " he deadpanned			0
" you 're scared before the first time , but after that you 're just not nervous anymore			0
