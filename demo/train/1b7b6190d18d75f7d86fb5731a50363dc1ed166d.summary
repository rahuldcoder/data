-- it is the scenario @entity2 had always feared -- the $ 11 billion party where the neighbors come round and trash your newly spruced up home			0
anybody but @entity9 , that is the message which is heard loudest in @entity2 ahead of sunday 's final against @entity10 in @entity11 at the @entity12			1
not since 1986 has @entity9 triumphed in the @entity13 , but that wait could be over should @entity15 and co. see off the @entity17			1
@entity2 was humiliated by @entity10 7 - 1 in the semifinal -- but an @entity20 @entity13 final victory might just trump that as an exercise in despair			1
after defeating the @entity24 on penalties , @entity9 is targeting its a third @entity13 win after reaching its fifth final			1
in 1978 , @entity9 , which hosted the tournament , defeated the @entity24 3 - 1 after extra time in the final in @entity30 to spark spectacular scenes of celebration			1
@entity33 was the hero , scoring twice against a @entity35 side which had lost at the same stage four years earlier against the @entity17			0
eight years later , @entity9 , led by @entity37 , reached the final once again where @entity39 was the opposition			1
in a tight game , @entity37 's wonderful pass released @entity43 to fire home a dramatic 84th minute winner as @entity9 prevailed 3 - 2			1
the @entity17 side , coached by @entity47 , got its revenge four years late when it won 1 - 0 in the final at @entity50			2
@entity52 's late penalty won a game marred by @entity9 's ill - discipline and the sending off of two of its players			1
@entity37 , who was then playing at @entity58 club side @entity57 , was left in tears as the @entity17 danced on the field of @entity62 's @entity61 with the trophy it had so badly coveted for a third time			2
it would be 20 years until the two teams met again in the quarterfinals of the @entity69 in @entity70			1
@entity37 , in his role as coach , watched on in horror as his side was thrashed 4 - 0 and star player @entity15 failed to sparkle			0
@entity76 opened the scoring with @entity78 , now the @entity13 's all - time leading goalscorer , adding two and @entity81 the fourth			1
it is @entity76 which @entity9 will have to watch at the @entity12 on sunday with the @entity85 star enjoying another impressive tournament			1
the 24 - year - old has already scored five goals in @entity2 and is one away from joining @entity90 's @entity89 as the top scorer on six			2
@entity10 , which was beaten in the semifinals in 2006 and 2010 , last reached the final in 2002 where it was beaten by @entity2			1
" we 've got to give our all on sunday , " @entity78 told reporters			0
" i know how it feels to lose a final			0
i want to lift that trophy into the air			0
" many of this current crop have grown up together with the likes of goalkeeper @entity105 , midfielders @entity101 , @entity106 all progressing from the youth setup			0
six of the team which won the @entity110 in 2009 are set to start against @entity9 with @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 all in the defense			1
while @entity117 's side produced a spectacular performance to dismantle @entity2 , it has not had a particularly easy ride to the final			2
after thrashing @entity122 4 - 0 in the opening fixture , it was forced to come from behind to secure a 2 - 2 draw against @entity125			0
a nervy 1 - 0 win over the @entity127 ensured it finished top of @entity129 and booked a last - 16 tie against @entity131			0
while @entity10 was widely expected to win , it was only after extra time that it managed to find a breakthrough			1
substitute @entity135 and @entity106 scored the goals and although @entity131 got one back late on , the @entity17 held out for a tense victory			0
the quarterfinal against @entity139 , played in the heat of @entity11 , was a rather turgid affair with @entity113 ' early header enough to secure a 1 - 0 win			0
the 7 - 1 win over @entity2 was achieved after @entity10 raced into a 5 - 0 lead by the interval following a mediocre defensive display from the host nation			2
so poor was @entity2 's performance that @entity76 revealed how the @entity17 players made a decision to ease off in the second half so not to embarrass its opponent			0
" with the score the way it was , we said we should avoid being arrogant and to refrain from humiliating the opponent , " he told reporters			0
" but that 's something obvious			0
yes , there was this agreement and it came from the players themselves			0
" there 's little chance of @entity10 letting up against @entity9 when the tournament 's top two go head - to - head			1
@entity169 , who will leave his role as coach after the final , has led his side through to the final following a hard - fought campaign			0
in all of its three group games , only one goal separated @entity9 from its rivals			2
after beginning with a 2 - 1 win over @entity180 , @entity9 was made to sweat until the very last minute against @entity181 before @entity15 curled home a stunning winner			2
against @entity184 , it was given a real fright before edging home 3 - 2 courtesy of @entity188 's close - range effort			0
having topped @entity189 , @entity9 progressed to face @entity190 which was defeated by a goal just two minutes before the end of extra-time			2
another 1 - 0 victory secured a semifinal place as @entity197 's strike ensured @entity198 was put to the sword			2
the semifinal showdown against the @entity35 was a dull affair with neither side managing to produce its best football			0
@entity204 , the @entity20 goalkeeper , became the hero after saving two penalties in the shootout before @entity208 struck the winning kick			0
it sparked wild scenes of jubilation , not just in @entity213 but across @entity9 where 40 million people celebrated the nation 's @entity215 with extra fervor			1
" @entity224 , @entity223 " — translated to " @entity2 , @entity225 " -- is the song that has been sung throughout the tournament by @entity20 fans confident of their team 's success			2
much of @entity9 's success will depend on @entity15 -- a man who has already scored four goals in the tournament and will captain the side in his 93rd international appearance			1
@entity15 's achievements are well known -- 381 goals in 466 matches for @entity233 , three @entity235 titles and six @entity238 @entity237 triumphs only tell half the story			0
now he is aiming to add to his 42 international goals by inspiring @entity9 to the biggest prize of all -- and the one which will surely make him one of the greatest players of all time			1
no @entity247 country has ever won the @entity13 in @entity248 -- if @entity15 gets his own way , that statistic wo n't change any time soon			1
as for millions of @entity224 football fans , who had so desperately sought a sixth world crown , sunday is the party invitation they had could have done without			0
@entity255 to referee final when it comes to famous football referees , @entity258 -- now retired -- might be the most famous of them all			0
@entity259 chose another @entity58 , @entity255 , to take charge of sunday 's final			1
the 42 - year - old architect from @entity263 refereed three games prior to the final , including two involving @entity9 , as well as the 2013 @entity235 final .			1
