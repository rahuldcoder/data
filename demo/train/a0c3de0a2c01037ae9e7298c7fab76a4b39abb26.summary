@entity0 -- here 's the best way to understand the new @entity3 in 30 seconds			1
watch this commercial — or better yet , if you do n't understand @entity5 , read on			0
a smarmy - looking politician addresses a rural gathering , promising to give the people access to water			2
his speech is interrupted by a boyish young man , a villager , who pulls out his smartphone and plays a @entity15 video for all to see : it 's the same politician , making the same promises at the last election , years ago			1
" i might be from the village , " cries out the young man , " but do n't think you can fool me ! " the commercial — marketing an @entity3 mobile service provider — cuts to its familiar @entity5 jingle , loosely translated as " no making fools of us anymore , no making fools of us			1
" the story struck me because it weaves together some important trends and forces in @entity3 as the nation undertakes the biggest elections in world history			1
the first trend is the immense proliferation of @entity39 - enabled smartphones			0
in most @entity42 countries , people have discovered the @entity39 and grown with it in stages : from painfully slow dial - up connections , to broadband , to @entity45 , to @entity47 mobile internet			0
@entity3 's story has been very different			1
until recently only a small elite — about a tenth of the population — could access the @entity39 , mostly through pcs. even today , there are only 57 million broadband subscribers in the country , according to the @entity56 , or @entity56			0
by comparison , there are about 900 million mobile subscribers — a recent boom			0
many of these mobile users are buying cheap smartphones and data packages to access the @entity39			0
the offshoot is the opposite of what happens in the @entity68 : hundreds of millions of @entity3 have never used a pc — and likely never will — but they can now begin to access the internet on their phones			2
the @entity39 is aspirational in @entity3 ; it 's the new motorbike or washing machine			1
the second trend is the rise of rural @entity3			1
again , according to @entity56 , 40 % of mobile subscribers are now in villages and small towns			0
even with the recent boom , rural subscriptions are still growing at more than twice the rate of urban ones			0
these rural subscribers , as the commercial shows , often do n't speak @entity86			1
but there 's no longer a great shame in being unable to speak the language of their colonial masters ; instead , there 's a new pride and confidence in @entity3 's many regional dialects and languages			1
there 's new rural money , and a yearning to be stakeholders in their futures and to fight for more accountable government			2
the third trend is @entity3 's youth bulge			1
more than 100 million voters in @entity3 's elections are first - timers who turned 18 in the last five years			1
half of all @entity3 are under age 30 ; the average age in @entity3 is 28			2
many of these young , brash @entity3 have cast off the fatalism of their forefathers			1
growing up in an @entity3 of fast growth and development , they have more confidence in their culture , identity and language			2
put that together with trends no. 1 and no. 2 , and the result is amplified			0
for the first time in @entity3 's history , a majority of @entity3 are connected and engaged			1
they know about the skeletons in every politician 's closet — and that information is power			1
some suggest that these trends mean @entity3 's elections will be fought and decided on social media			1
politicians have taken their cue , rushing to every platform available : @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143			0
the numbers seem staggering at first			0
@entity142 says @entity145 , the front - runner to be @entity3 's next prime minister , is the second most " liked " politician in the world ( 13 million likes ) , after @entity152 president @entity151 ( 40 million likes )			1
according to @entity141 , there has been a 600 % increase in political tweets from @entity3 in the last year			2
since january the two biggest parties , the @entity157 and the @entity158 , have grown their @entity141 followings by 55 % and 351 % respectively			0
@entity3 's @entity160 says a strong social media campaign could swing up to 4 % of votes			1
commentators have cited that data to brand @entity3 's elections the country 's first - ever " social media election			1
" for now , i 'm skeptical			0
some of the outreach attempts have been amateur at best : as @entity170 pointed out , the @entity157 's @entity141 handle last week auto - tweeted anyone who mentioned the party on @entity141 , including me and hundreds of others			0
in any case , the number of actual social media users represents a tiny percentage of the @entity3 electorate			2
@entity142 says it has 100 million users in @entity3 : it sounds like a lot but it accounts for less than a tenth of @entity3			2
one reason for this -- apart from limits to internet access -- could be that @entity141 and @entity142 remain @entity86 language services , relatable to a small subset of @entity3			2
unlike @entity189 , which has a @entity189 - language microblogging service called @entity191 , with hundreds of millions of users , @entity3 for now has no such indigenous , umbrella platform			0
why ? @entity3 is no monolith			0
there are dozens of languages , and an equal number of different @entity198			0
despite @entity3 's growth and increased connectivity , which suggests a more unified nation , the country may actually be becoming more regional - focused , with more pride in local languages , trends and politicians			1
this is also why i think it 's far too early to call @entity3 's elections for any one politician or party			1
the three trends of mobile reach , the rural rise and the youth bulge are each combustible forces bubbling in a cauldron of uncertainty			2
@entity3 may want accountability and change , but it 's too soon to tell which way that will manifest itself			2
it remains unclear whether @entity3 will vote for their regional interests , or cast their ballot thinking about a macro national picture			0
watch @entity3 's elections very closely			1
they 're immensely consequential — for @entity3 , and the world			0
but placing too much importance on social media chatter could be misleading			0
calling these elections too early could be embarrassing , too			0
it is , as the ad - jingle goes , a fool 's errand .			0

a commercial shows @entity3 voter catching a politician *recycling* old , *unfulfilled* promises
@entity244 : the power of mobile *technology* is helping shape @entity3 's elections
he says other key trends include the new prominence of rural areas and of young voters
@entity244 : it 's a mistake to try to predict the outcome based on these trends
