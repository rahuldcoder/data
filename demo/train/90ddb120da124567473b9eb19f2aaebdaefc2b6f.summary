-- party of no ? when it comes to @entity5 nominations , the @entity2 is a flock of baby lambs compared with their opposites on the @entity10 side			1
the past two @entity10 presidents have named three justices between them : @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16			2
all glided painlessly to confirmation			0
compare that with the mayhem inflicted on @entity2 choices			1
two of president @entity23 's nominees were rejected by the @entity24			1
ditto for one of @entity28 's choices ( another withdrew shortly after he was nominated )			1
one of president @entity31 's choices , @entity32 , was confirmed after a fight that still ranks as perhaps the most vicious in confirmation history			1
it 's hard to argue that the difference is due to the superior quality of the @entity10 choices			1
@entity16 's views were and are at least as controversial as @entity40 's			0
not only @entity40 , but two other @entity2 nominees ( @entity42 and @entity43 ) could show legal credentials that brightly outshone @entity14 's			1
nor is it just a matter of clout : although @entity2 lacked the votes to defeat @entity16 , @entity15 and @entity14 , they could have filibustered either of the first two			2
no , the difference is not in the nominees			0
it is in the parties			0
on judges , @entity2 have played by softer rules than @entity10			1
there 's no @entity2 equivalent of the notoriously scurrilous 1987 speech of sen. @entity59 's against @entity40 : " @entity40 's @entity63 is a land in which women would be forced into back - alley abortions , blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters , rogue police could break down citizens ' doors in midnight raids , schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution , writers and artists would be censored at the whim of government , and the doors of the federal courts would be shut on the fingers of millions of citizens for whom the judiciary is often the only protector of the individual rights that are the heart of our democracy			1
" it 's not as if republicans do not know how to play rough when they wish to do so			2
but on judges , @entity2 have not wished to play rough			2
why not ? @entity2 have won seven of the 11 presidential elections since 1968			2
over those same years , @entity2 presidents made a total of 11 appointments to the high court , with the nominees becoming steadily more conservative over time			1
democrats fought back , using every weapon at hand , including the very nasty weapons deployed against @entity40 and @entity32			0
and @entity2 counterattacked , by emphasizing the legitimate right of election winners to choose judges who reflected majority values			2
there 's an old saying : " where you stand depends on where you sit			0
" it 's also true however that parties take some time to realize that they are sitting in a new place			0
the @entity2 senators who deferred to president @entity112 's nominations had argued for years that it was inappropriate for senators to vote against a judge merely because they disagreed with a judge 's legal philosophy			1
those senators would not and could not abruptly reverse themselves			0
but what people can not do immediately , they can learn to do after a time			0
republicans voted for @entity16 and @entity15 to send a message about how @entity32 and @entity40 should have been treated -- and to lay down markers for how @entity2 judges should be treated in the future			1
but those votes , like the @entity14 vote , occurred in the immediate aftermath of a @entity10 presidential victory following many years of @entity2 administration			1
they do not necessarily foretell the future			0
as @entity2 settle into opposition , they may begin to think and feel like an opposition			0
they may lose the practice of deference , forget their objections to the filibuster of judicial nominations			0
president @entity142 's next nominee can probably expect the same easy time that @entity16 and @entity15 enjoyed			2
but if there are more nominations in a hypothetical @entity142 second term , they may discover themselves haunted by @entity59 's malign precedent and @entity32 ' brutal ordeal			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity152 .			0

@entity152 : @entity2 have *n't* been nearly as tough on court nominees as democrats have
@entity152 says last three @entity10 choices for the court have had relatively easy confirmations
@entity152 says republicans have shown greater deference to a president 's choices for the court
he says the @entity2 may adopt a harsher stance in the future
