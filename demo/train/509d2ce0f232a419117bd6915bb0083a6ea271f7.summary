the @entity1 's decision thursday to uphold the @entity2 means that the predictions about how it will affect @entity5 remain in place			0
@entity7 : @entity1 ruling on health care a victory for all @entity5 the court did rule that a part of the law involving @entity14 must change			1
the law calls for an expansion of eligibility for @entity14 , which involves spending by the federal government and the states			1
the law threatens to remove existing @entity14 funding from states that do n't participate in the expansion			1
the high court said the government must remove that threat			0
several groups that follow the health care law closely said they were concerned about the high court 's ruling on the @entity14 portion of the law			1
read the court ruling (			0
@entity36 ) here are some highlights : the uninsured the decision leaves in place the so - called individual mandate -- the requirement on @entity5 to have or buy health insurance beginning in 2014 or face a penalty -- although many are exempt from that provision			1
in 2014 , the penalty will be $ 285 per family or 1 % of income , whichever is greater			0
by 2016 , it goes up to $ 2,085 per family or 2.5 % of income			0
health care exchanges , which are designed to offer cheaper health care plans , remain in place as well			2
@entity56 ceo @entity55 said his organization was looking at the ruling on @entity14 , and is " concerned that the decision may limit the expansion of quality coverage to some of our nation 's most vulnerable citizens			1
" the group @entity66 , which spent tens of millions of dollars on ads supporting the health care plan , said it was " disappointed " and will work to make sure no states " choose to exclude the lowest - income uninsured adults from their @entity14 programs			1
" @entity76 , the trade group representing @entity14 health plans , praised the court " for keeping in place key elements of this historic legislation " and said it remains " committed to a strong partnership with the states and @entity80 ( @entity80 ) to find a way to cover this population in need			1
" rep. @entity87 , @entity88 , a physician who staunchly opposed the health care law , told @entity90 he believes many who would have received @entity14 will now enter the health care exchanges , which offer subsidized plans			1
that , he argued , could cost taxpayers billions of dollars across the country			0
breaking down the court 's decision the insured because the requirement remains for people to have or buy insurance , the revenue stream designed to help pay for the law remains in place			1
so insured @entity5 may be avoiding a spike in premiums that could have resulted if the high court had tossed out the individual mandate but left other requirements on insurers in place			0
young adults millions of young adults up to age 26 who have gained health insurance due to the law will be able to keep it			1
the law requires insurers to cover the children of those they insure up to age 26			2
about 2.5 million young adults from age 19 to 25 obtained health coverage as a result of the @entity2 , according to the @entity5 @entity125			0
two of the nation 's largest insurers , @entity129 and @entity130 , recently announced they would voluntarily maintain some aspects of health care reform , including coverage of adult dependents up to age 26 , even if the law was scrapped			2
people with pre-existing conditions since the law remains in place , the requirement that insurers cover people with pre-existing medical conditions remains active			1
the law also established that children under the age of 19 could no longer have limited benefits or be denied benefits because they had a pre-existing condition			2
starting in 2014 , the law makes it illegal for any health insurance plan to use pre-existing conditions to exclude , limit or set unrealistic rates on coverage			1
it also established national high - risk pools that people with such conditions could join sooner to get health insurance			1
as of april , a total of only about 67,000 people were enrolled in federally - funded pools established by the health care law , according to the @entity166			2
more than 13 million @entity5 non-elderly adults have been denied insurance specifically because of their medical conditions , according to the @entity171			2
the @entity172 says 21 % of people who apply for health insurance on their own get turned down , are charged a higher price , or offered a plan that excludes coverage for their pre-existing condition			1
photos : who is @entity183 ? all taxpayers no matter what the @entity1 had decided , it would have been a mixed bag for all @entity5 when it comes to federal spending			0
there is heated dispute over what impact the health care law will have on the country over the long term			2
the federal government is set to spend more than $ 1 trillion over the next decade to subsidize coverage and expand eligibility for @entity14			2
it is not immediately clear how the high court 's ruling on the part of the law dealing with the expansion of @entity14 eligibility could affect spending			1
the nonpartisan @entity206 estimated that the law could reduce deficits modestly in the first 10 years and then much more significantly in the second decade			0
the @entity206 said a repeal of the mandate could reduce deficits by $ 282 billion over 10 years , because the government would be subsidizing insurance for fewer people			0
but the nation faces costs in various ways for having people who are uninsured			0
the @entity220 's @entity219 estimated that without a mandate , 40 million @entity5 would remain uninsured			0
meanwhile , the @entity222 that millions of @entity5 use to save money tax - free for medical expenses will be sliced under the law			0
fsas often allow people to put aside up to $ 5,000 pre-tax ; as of 2013 , they were to face an annual limit of $ 2,500			0
opinion : are voters ready to move on ? small business owners the rules and benefits small business owners face as a result of the health care law remain in place			1
as @entity90 has chronicled , the law brought a mix of both			0
the director of the @entity243 is one of the plaintiffs who pushed the court to strike down the law			0
meanwhile , a group called @entity248 fought to protect the law , saying its loss could be a nightmare			0
as of 2014 , under the law , small firms with more than 50 full - time employees would have to provide coverage or face expensive fines			2
all @entity5 , in lesser known ways the massive health care law requires doctors to report goodies they get from medical supply companies ; demands more breastfeeding rooms ; requires all chain restaurants to list calories under every menu item , and includes numerous other provisions , which now remain in place			1
doctors and other health care providers health care providers have already begun making changes based on the 2010 law , and in preparation for what will go into effect in 2014			2
in the short term , doctors avoid " chaos " that may have resulted from the law suddenly being dropped or changed , according to @entity281 , senior vice president of governmental affairs at the @entity282 , who wrote a blog post on the website kevinmd.com this spring			0
medical groups have disagreed over the law			1
how the @entity1 justices voted opinion : a health care victory that 's only a start ruling plays into campaign narrative for both sides			0

groups express concerns about the @entity14 ruling
the requirement to have health insurance by 2014 remains in place
insurance companies must cover people with pre-existing conditions
small business owners and medical groups disagree over the impacts of the law
