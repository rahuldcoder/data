@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity1 government in @entity0 estimates the grinding conflict that has been tearing the country apart for the past five months has cost the national economy some $ 50 billion			1
" the cost is colossal , " said @entity7 , planning and finance minister for the @entity0 government			1
in an interview with @entity2 , @entity7 said the suspension of oil and gas exports had accounted for a huge chunk of the losses			1
" the income foregone because of the stoppage of the export of oil is something like $ 20 billion , " he said			2
this has brought an end to what had been a surge in prosperity for the @entity28 country			0
last year , @entity1 's economy was booming , with gross domestic product surging 10.3 % , according to the @entity31			1
and in a report published february 15 , the @entity31 's executive board concluded , " the outlook for @entity1 's economy remains favorable			1
" but two days later , protests against col. @entity37 's 41 - year rule erupted in the eastern city of @entity39			2
as protests spread to other cities and towns across the country , the @entity37 regime embarked on a bloody crackdown			0
today , the country is split into territories controlled by loyalists and opposition rebels			0
a @entity49 military alliance is now into the fourth month of a campaign of airstrikes against government targets after the @entity53 passed a resolution authorizing the use of force to protect civilian lives			0
the civil war has all but shattered ambitious plans to upgrade transport , housing and infrastructure in a country that had long been isolated from the international community			0
" the main objective was to create capacity for the economy to stand on its feet away from oil and gas production , " recalled @entity7 somewhat wistfully , as he described a five - year , $ 170 billion plan to modernize @entity1			1
in march , the legions of foreign workers who had been contracted to build railroads , airports , apartment buildings and telecommunications networks began fleeing the rapidly escalating conflict by the tens of thousands			0
the exodus included large numbers of engineers , construction and oil workers from @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , and the @entity87 , who crossed the western border with @entity90 on foot			1
at the time , many of them told @entity2 stories of being robbed at gunpoint by @entity1 security forces who took their cell phones , laptops and money			1
left behind were mammoth construction projects that still dot the @entity1 landscape			1
many of these unfinished structures were apartment buildings being built for an estimated 50,000 families across the country			0
" so many infrastructure projects ... were carried out by international companies , " @entity7 said			1
" yet the stoppage of these projects could be felt in the economy			2
particularly in the building sectors , the transportation sectors , the communication sectors			0
" more ominous for the @entity1 economy has been the @entity0 government 's growing isolation			1
@entity49 is enforcing a no - fly zone over @entity37 - controlled territory as well as a virtual blockade of @entity1 ports			1
the sanctions have created huge fuel shortages			0
long lines of cars now wait at service stations			0
this week , the government in @entity0 announced it was intervening to control rising prices of basic commodities			0
" in a crisis situation like this traders tend to profit more than they should , and therefore there is an intervention by the ministry of foreign trade for the prices of consumer goods , " @entity7 said			1
the minister said the government was fixing prices of rice , flour , meat , eggs , sugar and edible oils to prevent hardship among lower - income families			0
" we subsidize , basically , " @entity7 said , " with large amount of funds			1
" but @entity7 warned it was growing increasingly difficult for the embattled @entity37 regime to pay for these types of subsidies			2
he pointed out that foreign countries have frozen tens of billions of dollars in @entity1 government assets that had been carefully invested overseas in " treasury bills , bonds , stocks and investments in various international markets , whether in @entity166 , the @entity167 or @entity168			2
" @entity7 compared @entity1 's dwindling government coffers to the edible meat on an animal			1
" this should n't last long , otherwise we 'll be eating the fat and meat			0
and we 'll very soon arrive to the bones			0
" throughout the hour - long interview , @entity7 made no mention of the fact that last month , the @entity53 added his name to a list of high - ranking officials in the @entity37 regime now facing an international travel ban			2
he did , however , declare @entity0 's opposition to proposals to hand over frozen @entity1 government bank accounts to the opposition @entity188 headquartered in @entity39			1
last week , @entity167 secretary of state @entity189 announced @entity190 formally recognized the council in @entity39 as @entity1 's legitimate governing authority			1
state department officials said this could potentially give @entity39 access to some $ 30 billion in frozen @entity1 funds in the @entity167			2
" this is against international rules			0
the international monetary system can not withstand action in this manner , " @entity7 said			2
" if you are freezing through @entity204 @entity53 action funds for any country , then you ca n't confiscate it			0
there are legal obligations of the banks			0
" but when asked what recourse @entity0 would have if the @entity167 government went through with its threat , @entity7 conceded there are few options			2
" we should file litigation against them , " he said .			0

" the cost is colossal , " says @entity7 , @entity1 's planning and finance minister
the suspension of oil and gas exports accounts for a huge chunk of that , he says
@entity229 construction projects , now *abandoned* , still dot the @entity1 landscape
