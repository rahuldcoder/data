-- when i was at @entity3 10 years ago , there was a story of a history professor who began his lecture series with this piece of advice : " we all know that @entity10 was evil , but do n't write that in the exam			1
" the sweep of his judgment -- including the presumption that his students all thought the same -- articulates the way that @entity10 's legacy divides @entity21			1
the things she did may have been necessary , but the way that she did them cleaved the country in two			2
@entity28 was a paradoxical figure : a radical conservative			1
conservatives traditionally want to uphold the social order that they inherit , but she wanted to upend the postwar @entity21 consensus and return the country to what she regarded as its older glory			1
when she became prime minister in 1979 , she inherited a country in which public services were nationalized , unions were all - powerful and @entity21 power was in retreat overseas			1
her time in office proved revolutionary : the top rate of tax fell from 83 % to 40 % , major industries and services were privatized , the unions were reformed and their influence diminished and the @entity21 successfully liberated the @entity53 from @entity55 occupation			1
@entity21 owes its present wealth and global reputation to @entity28 , a woman who saw accepting decline as an immoral affront to patriotism			1
opinion : how ' @entity10 ' built transatlantic bridges there were many winners			1
people such as my parents were permitted to buy the house that they rented from the local government and so gained a stake in the property market			0
share ownership blossomed and the size of the banking industry broke 100 % of the gdp for the first time			2
average earnings increased 181 %			2
aspiration became fashionable in a land where people had always been taught that they were defined by the class in which they were born			2
i 'm very much one of " @entity28 's children " -- education and hard work have given me opportunities that were , for my parents , the stuff of dreams			2
but there were also losers			0
@entity28 insisted that her policies were about uniting the country by giving the working class an investment in capitalism			1
but she also demonized her opponents and spoke of the organized left as an " enemy within			1
" class conflict worsened as some felt that the government was prioritizing the needs of the southern middle class over the northern working class			2
there were riots in major cities , particularly among ethnic minorities , and the coal miners took @entity21 into a yearlong strike that sometimes felt like a civil war			1
opinion : why @entity28 was the ' @entity114 ' the conflict was motored as much by @entity28 's personality as her policies			2
i suspect that any government running @entity21 in the 1980s would have been forced to accept some degree of economic liberalization			1
left - wing governments in @entity122 and @entity123 also experimented with deregulation -- because the economic circumstances of the time demanded it , regardless of the political character of the government			0
what made @entity129 was its hard - headedness			2
there were episodes of compromise			0
@entity28 caved into one threat of a coal strike before refusing to cooperate with the second , and she held back from overhauling the welfare state , pouring money into the @entity140			0
but the tone of her administration was aggressive			0
when confronted by moderates within her own party , she famously said , " u-turn if you want to			0
the lady 's not for turning			2
" such rhetorical ferocity was common			0
@entity28 on consensus politics : " to me , consensus seems to be the process of abandoning all beliefs , principles , values and policies			0
so it is something in which no one believes and to which no one objects			0
" on society : " there is no such thing as society			0
there are individual men and women , and there are families			0
" @entity28 is compared to president @entity174 , and there are philosophical similarities			0
but a key difference is that @entity174 rhetorically always tried to find common ground between @entity179 and could be loved even by those who disagreed with him			0
@entity28 -- perhaps because of the scale of the challenges she faced -- almost always divided			0
today , you can instantly tell the politics of a @entity187 by the face they pull when you mention her name			0
opinion : why @entity21 needs another @entity28 however controversial her legacy it might be , her importance remains beyond dispute			1
@entity28 destroyed socialism in @entity21 , turned outdated public services into effective enterprises , broke the dead grip of militant unionism on everyday life and restored confidence to @entity21 on the global stage			1
imitation is the sincerest form of flattery , and the very @entity210 opposition that fought her so bitterly in the 1980s stole most of her policies in the 1990s -- and won themselves three elections as a result			0
former prime minister @entity221 of the @entity210 said on hearing the news of @entity28 's death , " i always thought my job was to build on some of the things she had done rather than reverse them			0
" and for a younger generation without clearer memories of the past , she can be admired as a woman from a humble background who broke through the ceiling of gender prejudice to transform her country			1
in an age when we seem to be led in the @entity21 by gray men from privileged backgrounds with a habit of chasing poll numbers rather than dreams , her ambition and zeal are truly missed			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity244 .			1

@entity244 says @entity10 was a paradox as a radical conservative
he says she upended @entity21 's *post-war* *trajectory* , cut taxes and increased privatization
she made country aspirational but demonized opponents and stoked class warfare , he says
@entity244 : as woman , she broke ground ; as @entity263 , she was important but divisive figure
