-- yes --- @entity1 posed for @entity2			1
her skin is creamy , her hair perfect			0
it 's not surprising ; it 's @entity2			1
it 's also not surprising that the conversation about @entity9 's @entity2 piece -- the first major profile she agreed to since becoming ceo of @entity13 -- has remained squarely focused on how she looks in the accompanying photograph			1
most criticisms , my own included , have examined @entity9 's role in this : at a time when women in the workplace desperately need role models , why did she allow herself to be depicted in a manner so far removed from most women 's realities ? on @entity0 , @entity28 writes that " a significant number of women ... were less than thrilled at the idea of one of the few women of real power still needing the affirmation of a @entity2 fashion shoot , " and " here 's a woman who has made it to the top because of her brains , does she still need to self - validate by having a beautiful fashion gig ? " but what 's so inexcusable about a woman wanting to look her best ? how is it self - validating to let a respectable magazine profile you in the way they know how ? or is the issue more about the audacity of a powerful woman sitting for a portrait that might be -- gasp -- flattering ? the truth is that we ca n't blame @entity9 , or @entity2 , for society 's obsession with , and response to , appearance			1
women , especially women who happen to be both beautiful and brilliant like @entity9 , are very often reduced to , or at least measured by , their looks			2
this was a reality before @entity9 's @entity2 spread , and it will be a reality after			1
the debate over @entity9 's culpability in agreeing to be sexed up for a fashion magazine implies that she has some power over the fact , some ability to change the truth , that looks matter , and that pretty people succeed more			1
because they do , with or without the " affirmation of a @entity2 fashion shoot			0
" according to a 2007 paper from the @entity81 @entity80 , overweight and obese white women face a significant " wage penalty			0
" according to research by @entity86 , author of " @entity84 : why attractive people are more successful , " the top one - third of attractive females earn about 10 % more annually than those in the bottom sixth of the genetic pool			0
and in her groundbreaking 1999 book , " @entity99 , " @entity93 psychologist @entity92 argues that good - looking people get better jobs , are better paid , and have an easier time in life			0
the evidence is in : evolutionarily speaking , pretty people win			2
@entity9 's looks likely helped her get ahead in some manner throughout her career ; as such , it 's unreasonable to expect that she 'd do anything but agree to play them up for a national audience			2
for women , who are faced with any number of disadvantages in the workplace , why not use what you can ? that 's not to say @entity9 is n't brilliant or hardworking ; it 's not an either / or in business or in life			2
but it 's unrealistic , and unfair , to expect that @entity9 would n't sit for a photo that was n't expected to turn out at least somewhat flattering			1
that 's not self - validation , or even narcissism			0
it 's nothing more than completely human			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity129 .			0

@entity129 : talk of @entity1 's @entity2 piece focused on her appearance
@entity129 : we ca n't blame @entity9 , or @entity2 , for society 's obsession with appearance .
she says @entity9 has no say over the fact that looks matter , pretty people succeed more
but it 's unfair , she says , to expect @entity9 to sit for a photo that was n't going to be flattering
