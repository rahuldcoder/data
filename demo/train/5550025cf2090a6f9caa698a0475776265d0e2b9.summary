-- the co-founder of the popular social news site @entity2 has called on the leaders of @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 to help defeat a controversial cybersecurity bill that would compromise the privacy of their users if passed by lawmakers			1
" i 'm hoping that all of these tech companies take the stand that their privacy policies matter , their users ' privacy matters , and no legislation like @entity23 should take that away , " @entity12 , former owner of @entity2 ( @entity14 's parent company @entity13 currently owns @entity2 ) , said in a video posted last week			1
" if someone wants access to our private home or to our mail we would say , well go get a warrant			0
right ? @entity23 basically says , uh , not necessary			0
your digital privacy is irrelevant			0
" the video shows @entity12 trying to call @entity4 ceo @entity34 to urge him to oppose the @entity23 ( @entity23 )			1
but when he reaches the company — through the switchboard — the operator tells him that no one by that name works at @entity4			0
" i am pretty sure there 's a @entity34 at @entity4 , " he replies			2
@entity12 , who is on the steering committee for the @entity42 and is very active in the fight to preserve internet freedom , also called on the public to sign a petition to defeat @entity23 in the way users helped defeat the @entity49 and @entity50 in 2011			1
" since we could n't get in touch with the deciders , maybe you can , " he says			0
" sign the petition , get on social media , because this is what defeated @entity49 and @entity50 and this is what will defeat @entity23 and this is what will defeat whatever they throw at us			1
internet freedom , internet privacy matters			0
" the bill opens the way for government agencies and the private sector to share information about cyberattack threats , but critics say it lacks protections to preserve the privacy of users and gives companies immunity for repercussions that might come as a result of sharing information			1
the @entity79 announced this week that president @entity80 planned to veto the bill if passed without protections that would force companies to anonymize and minimize data they provide the government and other companies			1
in a statement the @entity79 said it remained " concerned that the bill does not require private entities to take reasonable steps to remove irrelevant personal information when sending cybersecurity data to the government or other private sector entities			1
citizens have a right to know that corporations will be held accountable — and not granted immunity — for failing to safeguard personal information adequately			0
" despite @entity12 's plea and the @entity79 veto threat , the @entity79 passed the @entity23 bill on thursday by a vote of 288 to 127			1
a companion bill is planned for the @entity104			2
the @entity105 said today , following the passage of @entity23 in the @entity79 , that it will continue working to correct the problems with @entity23			2
" @entity23 is an extreme proposal that allows companies that hold our very sensitive information to share it with any company or government entity they choose , even directly with military agencies like the @entity119 , without first stripping out personally identifiable information , " @entity108 , legislative counsel at the @entity105 's @entity109 , said in a statement			2
" we will work with @entity122 to make sure that the next version of information sharing legislation unequivocally resolves this issue , as well as tightens immunity provisions and protects personal information			0
cybersecurity can be done without sacrificing @entity130 ' privacy online			0
