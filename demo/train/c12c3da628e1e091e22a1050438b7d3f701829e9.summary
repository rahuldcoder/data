-- a revolution squeezed into its margins -- but that 's where it started			1
it is february 11 , 2014			0
three years ago today , i walked to @entity7 to celebrate the fall of a dictator			0
in that square , we felt everything was possible , after @entity14 's 30 - year rule			1
it 's that feeling a recent film , " @entity17 " tried to capture			1
i resisted watching this @entity19 - nominated film for weeks			1
i was in @entity20 for many of the events it portrayed , and i knew i 'd be emotionally riven if the film were even partially accurate			1
indeed , it was painful to watch a film that captured so many of the core emotions of the past three years , and did it so well			2
the film did not portray my own memories : it mediated the emotional history of the revolution through the subjective experiences of certain key characters			2
they were all archetypes of the revolution			2
i wondered -- would the filmmakers do what so many writers on @entity20 have done , and go for the easy way out , focusing on spoiled rich kids , playing revolutionary ? they did n't -- the first revolutionary character , @entity43 , is hardly rich -- he 's a young , middle class , average @entity20			1
another central character is @entity46 -- a loyal member of the @entity47 , the political @entity48 group			1
@entity43 has struggled economically his whole short life -- @entity46 has spent time imprisoned for his political beliefs			0
it began with @entity14 himself , addressing the youth of @entity7 with such tenderness -- only to try to crush them			0
it continued with the military 's leadership saluting the revolution 's martyrs after @entity14 was forced from office -- only to be shown , unsympathetically , displaying singular disinterest in revolutionary reforms			1
it lingered with the @entity47 's leadership insisting on revolutionary intentions -- only to be seen deserting the revolutionary struggle for partisan power			1
the hope that all of @entity20 would become @entity7 of the 18 days : a place of respect , pluralism , and freedom			1
those that had hope now strive to ensure the hope itself does n't die			2
there was anger , as we see the potential of the revolution squandered -- and the anger remains			0
there was @entity91 -- the @entity91 © of the revolutionaries to understand where their power was , and where it was n't			0
on the second anniversary of the uprising , i was near @entity7 trying to convince some activists that , actually , they 'd lost the public 's support for protests some time before			0
the protest , for too many of them , had become the strategy itself , as opposed to a tactic for a better - defined goal			0
considering the film 's partiality to the ideals of revolution , i was pleasantly surprised to see the idealism of one of the characters , @entity20 - @entity117 @entity115 , challenged , more than once			1
@entity43 shows an innocent unwariness about the june 30 protests against then - president @entity120 : the film would have benefited from showing a counter to his exceedingly ill - placed confidence that the military of 2013 would be more restrained than the military of 2011			0
there was the killing of largely @entity131 protesters at @entity132 by the military in late 2011 -- a tragedy the film crew witnessed , and which turned a sizeable number against the military			0
there have now been more than a dozen " mass protester killings , " as the @entity140 put it -- and no acknowledgement or justice for them			0
the single worst incident was the clearing of the @entity148 sit - in -- a scene insufficiently covered in the film , though mentioned			0
the film is not the story of every @entity20 , or even every revolutionary			1
it 's a mediation of the revolutionary experience through these specific characters			2
the film is a story of the relationships of these individual characters with the revolution , and with each other			0
even though this is a deeply political film , political parties are rarely shown			0
@entity167 , nevertheless , to the film 's development , is the persona of @entity169 , a loyal @entity47 member			1
he humanizes ordinary @entity47 members , and of all the central characters , we know @entity46 as the most tortured , who suffered the most under @entity14 's regime			1
@entity46 's story is a profoundly conflicted one , as he struggles between his loyalty to an organization that supported him his whole life , and his ideals			2
his story causes others to be conflicted as well -- we see that although @entity43 opposes the @entity47 deeply , he wants to come to the @entity148 sit - in towards the end , to stand by @entity46			1
a deeply sympathetic and gallant character , @entity46 survives the clearing of the sit - in , unlike the many hundreds who did not			2
the film certainly prioritizes a revolutionary lens , rather than pretending to be a bland chronicle , for these tragic revolutionary heroes provided the context of the square and the revolution			2
watching it now reminds us that in the past few months and years , many who would have been in that square would have been killed , or imprisoned			0
the film reminds us of a revolution that has been squeezed into the margins -- but also reminds us that , indeed , is where the revolution itself started			0
read : how @entity207 abandoned @entity20 's @entity208 read : @entity20 's revolution on the margins the views expressed in this piece are solely those of @entity213 .			1

@entity19 - nominated ' @entity17 ' traces @entity20 's revolution through revolutionaries
different experiences portrayed *including* working class @entity220 revolutionary
a gallant , loyal @entity47 member conflicted about his leaders , writes @entity213
emotions of hope , idealism , pain , and betrayal shine through - @entity213
