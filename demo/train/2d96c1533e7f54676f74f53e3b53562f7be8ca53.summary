-- here we go again			0
just as in the 1980 's , some conservative moralists and pundits are trying to blame @entity5 's current economic insecurity , joblessness and social inequality on the very people most victimized by these socioeconomic trends			0
once again , they are telling us that people can make it if they just pull themselves up by their own bootstraps , keep their shoulders to the grindstone and cross their legs until marriage			2
a paper from the @entity19 last week week recycles the 1992 election slogan that the best antidote to poverty is marriage			1
this theme was also sounded by @entity26 at the @entity27 , who claimed that the cure for poverty and economic insecurity is within anyone 's grasp : " graduate from high school , work hard and get married before you have children , " he exhorted his listeners to thunderous applause , " and the chance you will ever be in poverty is just 2 %			1
" seriously ? have any of these pundits and politicians talked to any people who have lost their jobs in the past 15 years ? graduating from high school is certainly a good idea , but it 's no longer much protection against poverty			1
in fact , 70 % of working - age adults who live in poverty do have high school diplomas , and many have even attended college , according to calculations prepared for a forthcoming paper by economist @entity58 , senior research associate at the @entity59			1
over the past three years , indeed , @entity5 with some college under their belts have experienced sharper declines in income than any other group			2
working hard is also good advice , but a majority of @entity5 families have seen their real wages stagnate or decline over the past 30 years , even as they increased their involvement in paid labor			0
by 2007 -- before the start of the recession -- the average employed 25 - to 29 - year - old man with a high school degree made almost $ 4 less per hour ( in constant dollars ) than his counterpart in 1979			1
and that 's if he could find work in the first place			0
the likelihood that such a man would experience a job loss , reduction in pay and benefits , or financial emergency he could not meet out of savings has increased threefold since the 1970s			2
in an era when two incomes are increasingly necessary to raise a family , getting married makes excellent economic sense for a woman who wants to have a child			0
but first she needs to find a man who can actually make a financial contribution to the marriage -- an increasingly difficult task , especially for working - class @entity102 - @entity5 women			1
@entity104 sociologist @entity103 reports in his forthcoming book , " @entity106 : diversity , inequality and @entity109 , " that in big cities , there are often fewer than 50 single , employed black men for every 100 unmarried black women in the same age range , because of poor employment opportunities , high incarceration rates and disproportionate mortality rates			1
white working - class women , with or without high school degrees , also increasingly face a shortage of marriageable men			1
and they have good reason to approach marriage cautiously , even if they get pregnant , because economic insecurity is strongly associated with marital distress			2
this is one reason that high school graduates are twice as likely to divorce as more economically secure college graduates			1
getting married and then divorcing often leaves a woman worse off than if she had remained single , with or without children , and had focused on improving her own earning power			1
it is true that single parenthood is associated with poverty , especially in the @entity5 , where single mothers find it hard to work full time or further their education because they lack affordable child care			1
but nonmarriage is often a result of poverty and economic insecurity rather than a cause			2
unemployment , low wages and poverty discourage family formation and erode family stability , making it less likely that individuals will marry in the first place and more likely that their marriages will dissolve			0
the claim that single motherhood is currently the biggest obstacle to success in @entity5 is particularly wrong - headed , because the claim is almost 30 years out of date			0
rising rates of unwed motherhood did contribute to increases in the percentage of low - income and poverty - level families in @entity5 from 1975 to 1995			0
but since then , the majority of the increase in family inequality has been because of growing economic insecurity in groups of people who have the same family structure			0
almost 36 % of @entity5 's impoverished children -- 5.9 million kids -- live with married parents			0
if we include low - income families -- people who are just one missed pay check , one illness or one divorce away from poverty -- the figure rises to nearly 50 %			1
another claim being recycled in this campaign season -- that our social and economic ills come from people depending too much on government -- is equally divorced from reality			0
one of the biggest myths promulgated over the past two decades has been the insistence that government support systems inevitably perpetuate dependency			0
but history tells a different story			0
from the 1950s to the mid- 1970s , the @entity5 greatly increased government support systems for workers , expanding @entity196 , enlarging the safety net and investing in school construction and infrastructure that created jobs for blue collar workers while improving housing and educational access for the middle class			1
the result ? more @entity5 were able to work their way into economic security and to invest in education and training that enabled their children to do even better			0
over that period , the poverty rate was halved , falling from 22 % to 11 %			2
it is not the expansion but the erosion of government support and job creation over the past three decades , in combination with the decline of labor unions and employers ' benefits , that largely accounts for the setbacks @entity5 families are experiencing and for the decline in social mobility since the 1980s			1
investing in living - wage jobs and reducing the inequities between local school districts would give young people more , not less , incentive to postpone childbearing and more possibilities for independence			0
and here 's one more thing to ponder for anyone truly interested in helping young people avoid early parenthood : since the majority of unwed births , especially among youths , are unintended , government should also provide more widespread access to comprehensive sex education programs and contraception , not throw up barriers to such access			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity251 .			2

@entity251 : chorus of conservatives says marriage , high school diploma fight poverty
she says that *misleads* : 70 % in poverty have diploma ; there is a *scarcity* of *breadwinning* men
she says divorce often leaves women worse off than if they *'d* stayed single , *pursued* college
@entity251 : historically , government investment in safety net , job creation , education cuts poverty
