@entity0 , @entity1 -- on the edge of the world 's biggest salt desert , villagers optimistically scrawl " salt for sale " signs on their mud brick homes			1
in backyards , mountains of the stuff are heaped like year - round snow drifts			2
the sparse beauty of @entity1 's @entity15 is attracting growing numbers of tourists			1
but mining salt is no longer the only way to survive in this cold , arid corner of southwestern @entity1			1
the @entity21 is becoming a must - see for adventurous visitors to @entity23 , changing at least some fortunes in the poor village of @entity26			0
" there 's nothing here apart from salt ... tourists used to arrive and they would n't buy anything , so we thought , ' how can we improve things ? " ' said @entity31 , who now sells ashtrays and llama figurines carved from salt stone			1
stretched between distant @entity40 peaks like a shimmering white carpet , the @entity21 is home to pink flamingos , 1,000 - year - old cacti , rare hummingbirds and hotels built entirely from blocks of salt			1
earlier this year , leading travel publisher @entity48 listed the @entity15 as one of its top 25 wonders of the world , alongside far better - known attractions such as the @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55			1
at least 60,000 tourists visited the roughly 4,250 - square - mile salt flat last year , and local officials say their numbers are steadily rising			1
apart from freezing night temperatures and fierce desert sun , visitors have to brave a grueling journey on unpaved roads to reach the @entity15 , which lies about 185 miles south of the capital @entity67 near the @entity69 border			0
some 40,000 years ago , it was part of a lake that covered a large swath of the @entity40 highlands			2
the moon - like landscapes of the salt desert are part of what was left when it dried up			0
in the nearby town of @entity21 , residents and local officials have ambitious plans for its future as a hub for tourism , which has fast overtaken llama - herding and quinua - farming as the impoverished region 's main economic activity			0
at the recent start of a road - building scheme to link @entity96 with the city of @entity98 , the provincial governor said he wanted @entity96 to be " the world 's top tourist city " with the help of the highway and new attractions such as a llama museum			1
even before the road has been paved , some officials have also proposed the construction of a high - speed railway using profits from the region 's revitalized silver - mining industry			0
but with frequent power cuts , a lack of drinking water and only basic hotels , they admit they have a long way to go			0
" there 's no center to deal with the garbage			0
the wind blows and all the garbage ends up back in town , " said @entity120 from the non-governmental organization @entity122 , which is trying to promote better practice in tourism			0
for tourists who want to stay on the @entity15 itself , there are several hotels made from salt bricks -- beds , chairs and cocktail bars included			1
" people want to test it 's really made of salt by licking the walls , " said @entity136 , a workmen building a new salt hotel , as he crammed coca leaves into mouth			1
" they 're very impressed when they see that it 's all made from salt			2
" the view from the hotel 's windows is flat whiteness , fringed by the peaks of mountains on the horizon beneath a bright blue sky			2
the silence of the @entity15 is only broken by the occasional tour group speeding by in a four - wheel - drive vehicle			0
@entity15 tourism director @entity159 expects twice as many tourists to be visiting the @entity15 within five years as word of its otherworldly beauty gets out			2
" the @entity15 has the ability to captivate people with its silence and tranquility , " he said , sitting before the towering cacti of one of the salt flat 's islands			1
" its intrinsic beauty is the attraction			0
