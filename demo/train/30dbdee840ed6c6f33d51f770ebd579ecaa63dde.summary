@entity0 , @entity1 -- her ankles and wrists are shackled			1
she 's wearing used sweats in the bright colors of the jailhouse , orange , blue and yellow			2
she shuffles to the courtroom to face the judge , her mother , and an uncertain future			2
@entity15 is a 13 - year - old who was sold for sex			1
she wants to go home to her house in the suburbs and the baby sister she hardly knows			2
and now , facing a sympathetic judge and a loving mother who wants to make sure she 's safe , @entity15 is being told she ca n't go home			1
" i want to go home and i want to be with my family , that 's all i want , " she tells @entity27 judge @entity26 , her face bathed in tears			2
" this is n't making me any better in here			2
" @entity15 was arrested by undercover police on the vegas strip on prostitution charges			1
but although she exchanged sex for money , in the eyes of the law , she 's a victim , by virtue of her age and the circumstances under which she was sold : by a pimp on the website backpage.com , a pimp who used drugs to entice her , and took everything she earned			1
" it made me feel so nasty , i always just want a shower and get it off			2
i was like , oh , it 's so disgusting , " she said			2
" and it never made me feel pretty , not one time , not one time			2
" she told us she was seeing four or five men a day , at the standard rate of $ 300 for an hour , $ 150 for a half			2
she may be a victim , but she ca n't go home , because no one trusts that she wo n't run again , back into the arms of a pimp			2
like so many other underage trafficking victims , @entity15 is a chronic runaway , picked up by a pimp after she took off from home			1
" i was at the bus stop and he said ' oh , do you need a ride ? ' and i was like ' yeah i do			2
' i liked him a lot			2
i was straight up obsessed			2
i was like ' wow , he 's so cute , ' " she says from an interview room at the @entity72 , where she 's being held			2
" it was n't just at first like ' oh bitch , go get me money , ' it was n't like that at first -- but then it got like that			0
" home for @entity15 is a nice single - family house in a new development on the outskirts of @entity0			1
@entity15 's mother shows us her room			1
it looks like any other 13 - year - old girl 's , except for the lipstick scrawl on her bedroom mirror spelling out the names of boys her mother has never met : boys , or maybe men			1
" i do n't know			0
i mean , honestly , i do n't know what 's happening , " her mother says			0
" i only knows what she tells me			0
and she does n't really tell me anything			0
so i do n't know			0
" @entity15 and her mother agreed to speak with us on camera			1
their names have been changed so that any future internet searches do n't link her back to this story			0
but speaking on camera under these circumstances is a mark of bravery , and also of desperation			0
" people say , ' oh , @entity0 , ' but it 's not just @entity0 , " says @entity15 's mother , who is a schoolteacher			1
" you hear everywhere of kids , you know , being picked up and you never ever see them again			0
so it 's a horrible feeling			0
and no matter how many times that i talk to her about it , it 's just like she 's just not getting it			0
" she 's not alone			0
according to the @entity124 , there are at least 100,000 underage girls being sex trafficked in @entity127 today			1
that 's a conservative estimate based on what little hard data currently exists ; @entity124 believes the real number could be as high as 300,000			0
most are runaways , suffering from psychological problems or drug dependence , picked up and sold by pimps for staggering profits			1
according to studies , pimps can make up to half a million dollars a year , and they frequently prey on the young and the vulnerable			0
the pimps ply their trade on the web , the new marketplace for underage sex trafficking			1
last year , victims ' advocates called the internet classified site @entity145 the " @entity146 of child sex trafficking			1
" @entity2 investigated @entity145 , posting an ad and receiving numerous calls from men seeking sex			1
that investigation helped spark a national conversation and outrage , as well as a call from 17 attorneys general around the country for @entity145 to shut down its adult services section			0
video : confronting @entity145 but when @entity145 shut down its section , the escort ads migrated to another site , backpage.com			1
we decided to investigate @entity164 after advocacy groups accused the website , which is owned by the @entity167 , of facilitating the trafficking of underage girls			1
according to the @entity171 , an internet consulting firm , @entity164 's escort site earned an estimated $ 20 million in 2010			1
its profits soared after @entity145 decided to pull the plug on its adult services section			0
we found cases all over the country of underage girls being sold for sex on @entity164 : @entity15 in @entity0 , a 12 - year - old in suburban @entity182 , and a 14 - year - old in @entity184			1
for months , @entity2 has requested an interview with @entity164 and @entity167 executives to talk about the accusations , but the company has refused			1
last fall , @entity164 hired internet security advisor @entity189 to implement " a holistic plan centered around preventing criminal activity on our site			1
" we wanted to know what that " holistic plan " was , but @entity197 would n't talk to us either			0
full nudity appears to have disappeared from the site , but suspect ads with tag lines such as " @entity202 " are common			0
we posted our own ad , using a photo of @entity2 correspondent @entity205 when she was 14 years old			0
she told the men who called that she was underage ; most did n't care			1
video : @entity2 's @entity205 posts @entity164 ad one man offered @entity211 $ 30,000 to travel to another state and meet a wealthy friend of his to have sex in an expensive hotel			1
we went to the hotel , confirmed the offer was genuine , but stopped before accepting the money			0
but the point where we stopped is the start for many underage prostitutes , like @entity15			1
@entity15 desperately wants to return home , but the judge and her mother fear she will run away again and fall into the hands of another pimp			1
so they came up with a short - term solution : to send her to a facility in @entity229 that can at least deal with her drug problems			0
a private foundation is standing by to assist with long - term care when she gets out			0
but there are no guarantees			0
her mother remembers @entity15 when she was 11 , getting good grades , a happy kid , before it all went wrong			1
she sometimes wishes her daughter would be like other kids , just for a day			0
" you know , just to have a kid that actually just goes to school and comes home and does their homework and watches tv , you know			0
but that 's not the case , " she says			0
" i do n't want to take anything away from her because she 's great , in her own way			0
it 's just , i do n't know , i feel like she 's lost -- to be honest , i do			0

@entity15 , 13 , was sold for sex on @entity164
advocacy groups have accused the website of facilitating the trafficking of underage girls
neither backpage.com nor its owner would comment on those accusations
