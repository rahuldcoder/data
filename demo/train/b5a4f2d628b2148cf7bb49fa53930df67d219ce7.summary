-- a new one - volume guide to virtually every rumor , controversy , assertion and accusation about @entity6 -- scurrilous or otherwise -- is about to hit the stands , and it 's already generating a storm of controversy			1
" the rogue : searching for @entity20 @entity6 " by @entity21 is a merciless review of @entity6 's personal life and meteoric rise from the mayor of a small @entity16 town to the center of @entity19 's political universe			1
@entity0 obtained a copy of the book -- which relies heavily on unnamed sources -- earlier this week			0
@entity6 critics will find some of their worst assumptions about the former governor reinforced by @entity21 ; @entity6 defenders will be outraged			1
the book portrays @entity6 as an image - obsessed governor who was ill - prepared for the burdens of @entity34 's town hall -- much less for the @entity36 presidential ticket			1
if that 's not enough for you , how about charges of racism , adultery , and cocaine abuse ? her parenting skills also leave something to be desired , if @entity21 is to be believed			1
needless to say , those closest to the former governor are not amused			0
the @entity6 family has had a rocky relationship with @entity21 since he moved in next door to their home in @entity34 last summer to research the book			1
@entity6 's husband , @entity54 , accused @entity21 this week of " relentlessly stalking my family to the point of moving in right next door to us to harass us and spy on us to satisfy his creepy obsession with my wife			1
" " his book is full of disgusting lies , innuendo , and smears , " @entity54 asserted			1
the former governor told @entity67 that @entity21 " needs to get a life			2
" the @entity6 circle is not alone in its criticism of @entity21			1
@entity72 reviewer @entity71 called most of the book " dated , petty and easily available to anyone with internet access			0
" @entity71 accused @entity21 of using his time living near the @entity77 " to chase caustic , unsubstantiated gossip , " often attributed to unnamed sources such as " a friend " or " one resident			2
" in an interview broadcast thursday on @entity84 's " today " show , @entity21 said : " i think i was as fair as i could possibly have been given the fact that ( @entity6 ) told all the people who were closest to her not to talk to me			1
" @entity6 " overreacts , " @entity21 said			1
" she has no modulation in her responses to stress			0
" @entity21 ' other notable books include " @entity90 " in 1969 -- a critical review of @entity93 's first successful presidential campaign -- and " @entity94 " in 1983 about dr. @entity95 , a military physician who was convicted of murdering his wife and children			2
he also wrote a book about @entity16 -- " @entity99 " in 1980			0
@entity21 ' website calls his latest work " an extraordinary double narrative that alternately traces @entity6 's curious rise to political prominence and worldwide celebrity status and then recounts the author 's day - to - day experiences as he uncovers the messy reality beneath the glossy @entity6 myth			1
" among other things , the book cites an unnamed friend who claims @entity6 once snorted cocaine off an overturned 55 - gallon oil drum while on a snowmobiling trip			1
as for @entity54 , he " did coke with us all , " former friend @entity116 says in the book			0
" he was on the end of the straw plenty			0
" " i 'm not saying @entity54 and @entity6 today abuse cocaine or even use it , but there is no question they both did at one point in their lives , " @entity21 told @entity84			1
@entity116 was fired from his position as gov. @entity6 's legislative director because he " dared to embark on a romantic relationship with the estranged wife of a friend of @entity54 's , " @entity21 writes in the book			1
@entity21 also repeats an allegation that @entity6 had an affair with @entity137 , one of her husband 's former business partners			1
@entity137 denied the charge in a statement thursday , calling it " a complete and outright lie			0
" one gossipy tidbit : @entity6 had a sexual encounter with former @entity146 star @entity145 in 1987 , before she was married			2
@entity145 played for the @entity147 at the time			0
" she freaked out afterward , " @entity21 quotes a source in the book as saying			2
" the thing that people remember is ... how completely crazy she got " over the fact that she had sex with an @entity155			0
" she was just horrified			0
she could n't believe that she 'd done it			0
" @entity145 , according to @entity21 , remembers @entity6 as " a sweetheart			1
" @entity21 states that , as governor , @entity6 fired roughly two dozen state employees who had formed a coalition known as the @entity161			1
" her distaste for people of color ... became manifest , " @entity21 asserts			2
" @entity6 just is n't comfortable in the presence of dark - skinned people , " @entity116 says in the book			2
@entity21 also cites unnamed friends in characterizing @entity6 as a subpar mother			2
" from the start ... @entity54 was the parent , " one source says in the book			0
" when he was home , he changed the diapers			0
@entity6 never lifted a finger			0
" in her @entity72 review , @entity71 complained that @entity21 spent too much time writing about his own day - to - day experiences and not enough on detailed research			2
noting that @entity21 ' book includes a comment by one source on the condition of the @entity186 ' toilet , @entity71 wrote : " a journalist as seasoned as mr. @entity21 surely knows what these details will do to his credibility regarding the book 's more serious claims			1
" right or wrong , the book has thrust @entity21 into a media spotlight that continues to follow @entity6 despite the fact that she is no longer in public office and has not announced any campaign for the @entity198 in 2012			1
there is even a " @entity202 " connection to the latest @entity6 drama			0
@entity203 , the celebrated creator of the long - running comic strip , last summer developed a story line with one of his stock characters -- @entity209 journalist @entity208 -- moving next door to @entity21 in @entity34 to spy on his spying on the @entity186			2
@entity21 subsequently contacted @entity203 and the pair came up with a way to release tweet - sized advance excerpts of the book in " @entity202 " -- this time via a pre-publication copy of the manuscript of " @entity218 " that lands in the fictional @entity208 's hands			1
the " @entity202 " story line has @entity222 's boss at @entity67 warning him to protect fellow @entity223 in his coverage of the book , and @entity222 tweeting misleading depictions of the real excerpts			0
several newspapers , including the @entity229 and the @entity230 , have decided against running the installments of " doonesbury " that involve the @entity6 book			2
" this week we are not publishing ' @entity202 ' comic strips because they do not meet our standards of fairness , " said a published note by @entity235			0
the @entity229 noted that copies of the book were unavailable for review			0
@entity71 wondered in her review what was stopping the @entity229 and others from publishing the cited strips			0
" is it the book 's intrepid reporting , or its questionable tone ? " she asked			0
" mr. @entity21 's most quotable , inflammatory lines call ms. @entity6 a clown , a nitwit , a rabid wolf and a lap dancer -- and those are n't the parts that assail her as a wife and parent			1
" @entity0 's @entity259 and @entity260 contributed to this report			0

" @entity218 " by @entity21 comes out next *tuesday*
