-- when @entity2 won her first grand slam title and the season - ending championships in 2011 , big things were expected of the @entity6 tennis player			1
it 's been a bumpy ride since , as the @entity6 struggled to live up to expectations last year , but saturday 's victory in the @entity12 final is evidence that the 22 - year - old is getting back on track			1
@entity2 overcame a mid-match scare to beat last year 's @entity18 finalist @entity17 6 - 2 1 - 6 6 - 1 to become the first player from her country to win the $ 2 million tournament			1
" i 'm glad how i 'm playing right now -- that 's the important thing for me , " said @entity2 , who had not won two matches in a row at a @entity25 event since august before last week 's @entity27 tournament			0
" i 'm not thinking this is a turning point for me			0
yes , it was a lot of great players here and it was hard to beat them , but i 'm still just thinking about my game			0
" it was the former @entity39 champion 's first title in six months , and her biggest since the @entity41 in @entity42 , as the world no. 8 took home the $ 442,000 first prize			1
it capped a big week for @entity2 , who beat former world no. 1 and 2011 @entity50 champion @entity49 in the semifinals after ending the title defense of fourth - ranked @entity53 following a straight - sets win over @entity55			1
she has bounced back from a shock second - round loss to @entity59 teenager @entity58 at january 's @entity60 and a surprise defeat by @entity64 wild - card entry @entity62 at the @entity65 , winning both matches as the @entity6 thrashed @entity67 in the first match of their @entity70 title defense			2
fifth seed @entity17 , ranked one place higher than @entity2 , was blown away in the first set but bounced back to take the second as she adopted a more aggressive game and won six games in a row			2
however , the @entity77 was unable to maintain that momentum and win her first title this year , and seventh of her career			2
" i knew i had to keep fighting for every ball , because she was really on fire in the second set and continued that in the third too , " said @entity2 , whose coach missed the tournament to go on holiday			0
" i was just thinking to not give up and just fight for every point			0
when it was 2 - 1 and she missed a volley , i think that was a turning point for me			0
" i was quite down after the second set			0
i just tried to stay positive and just play			0
" both players had reached the quarterfinals of the previous tournament in @entity98 , where @entity2 lost to new world no. 1 @entity100 and @entity17 was beaten by her predecessor @entity101			1
" this court is very fast , so it 's not my favorite court and it 's tough for me to play on this court , so making the final is a very good tournament for me , " @entity17 said			0
@entity108 and runner - up @entity100 both pulled out of @entity50 due to injuries -- the @entity111 before the tournament , and the @entity113 just ahead of her opening match			0
on the men 's @entity116 @entity116 , sixth - ranked @entity115 will play no. 8 @entity118 in sunday 's final of the @entity121			1
@entity2 's compatriot @entity115 beat @entity124 qualifier @entity125 6 - 2 6 - 1 , while @entity118 was similarly dominant as he defeated fellow @entity64 @entity126 6 - 2 6 - 2			1
world no. 4 @entity127 has reached the final of the @entity130 in @entity131 , where he is defending his title			2
the @entity60 semifinalist beat compatriot @entity134 6 - 3 6 - 2 on saturday , while @entity135 beat yet another @entity136 in @entity137 , winning 6 - 3 7 - 5			1
the @entity139 third seed reached his first final since january 2011 , and has a 3 - 6 record in title matches .			2
