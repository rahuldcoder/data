on the sunday after the @entity2 massacre , president @entity0 traveled to @entity3 to comfort the grieving community			2
as the president offered what he could to the town , other @entity8 communities , in less visible ways , were grappling with their own menace of violence			2
in @entity13 -- a city that has already suffered 65 violent deaths in 2012 , surpassing the previous record of 58 violent deaths set in 1995 -- 50 people turned out , some bearing white crosses , to mourn a homeless woman known affectionately as the " cat lady " who was stabbed to death ( 50 of the deaths so far this year resulted from gunshot wounds			0
) in @entity28 , on the same sunday , city leaders came together at a roundtable to discuss their own epidemic of gun violence ; the year - to - date total of homicides is 322			2
last year , 324 were killed			0
of those victims , 154 were 25 or younger			0
a councilman at the roundtable asked , " how come as a city we 're not in an outrage ? how come we 're not approaching this from a crisis standpoint ? " the concerns go beyond @entity28			0
in the week following the @entity2 massacre , there were at least a dozen gun homicides in @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 alone			0
in a year of highly publicized mass shootings , inner - city neighborhoods that are plagued by gun violence have continued to be neglected and ignored			1
according to the @entity54 , large metropolitan areas account for more than two - thirds of deaths by gun violence each year , with inner cities most affected			2
the majority of the victims are young , ranging in age from their early teens to mid- 20s , and black			0
to track these violent deaths , many communities and media organizations have set up agonizing online trackers -- homicide watches or interactive maps -- that show each subsequent victim as just another data point			0
these maps are representative of a set of issues far larger than the nameless dots suggest			0
in the immediate aftermath of @entity2 , as politicians and public figures across @entity8 grapple with the horrible truths of gun violence , far less visible from the national spotlight is the steady stream of inner - city victims			1
the media is fixated , and with justification , on the string of high - profile massacres that have rocked the nation in @entity89 , @entity90 ; @entity91 , @entity92 ; @entity93 ; and now in @entity2			2
yet in many of @entity8 's neighborhoods most affected by the calamity of gun violence , there is a warranted exasperation -- residents are tired , tired of the ubiquity of guns , tired of fearing for their children 's safety , tired of being forgotten			1
critiquing a narrow media focus does n't deny the horrible , tragic nature of the massacre at @entity2 ; mass shootings , however , make up only a small fraction of @entity8 's shockingly high level of gun crime			1
in his study " @entity118 , " @entity112 showed that while the overall risk of being murdered is higher in @entity8 than it is in any other first - world democracy , homicide rates vary drastically among groups			0
according to @entity112 , if current trends are maintained , one out of every 158 white males born today will be murdered , but for nonwhite males it is likely one of every 27 born today will be murdered			0
the stark difference in these racial trends can be traced to the high levels of racial segregation in @entity8 's cities , which have created a spatial barrier between poor inner - city youths of color and more mainstream @entity8 -- a barrier that is often responsible for the lack of media and political attention paid to inner - city problems			1
many experts claim that actually it is the spectacular nature of mass shootings that naturally magnifies media coverage and explains the resonance of these tragedies to the broader public			1
inner - city violence on its own , however , does not suffer from a lack of awful , spectacular violence and calamity			0
in fact , the gruesome nature of violence in inner cities has contributed to widespread social desensitization to gun violence			0
how then do we explain the differing public responses ? an indicator of the difference of attention levels lies in the tone of the public rhetoric in the wake of mass shootings : " this was supposed to be a safe community , " and " this kind of thing was n't supposed to happen here			2
" these statements imply that in @entity8 's leafy - green small towns and suburbs , gun violence is a shocking travesty ; it strikes against @entity8 's perception of what is acceptable			1
in contrast , gun violence in the @entity8 metropolis has been normalized , and the public and media display a passive indifference toward the lives of inner - city youths			1
this normalization of inner - city violence is due in part , to the isolation and segregation of @entity8 's ghettos from wider @entity8 , but it is also due to a sense that the victims of inner - city violence are responsible for their own condition			1
as @entity197 , a professor at @entity198 , has highlighted , the gun violence in @entity8 cities is born out of neighborhood characteristics such as poverty , racial segregation and lack of economic opportunity			1
this shortened explanation for the high levels of inner - city violence has often been mistaken to imply that it is the direct choice of inner - city residents to remain either in poverty or in their segregated community that leads to their victimization			0
in reality , the victims of inner - city gun violence are the victims of a dual tragedy			2
the first is that the poverty and segregation , which play a crucial role in spurring the downward cycle of crime , are the result of social arrangements predicated on longstanding oppression and prejudice			0
through a complex mix of violence , institutional arrangements and exploitation , black @entity8 were pressured into ghettos , which are the hotbeds of contemporary gun violence			2
their inability to escape their conditions is not a choice but rather the byproduct of continued structural discrimination			0
slowing the tide of inner - city deaths through gun control is therefore a modern - day civil rights issue			1
if the refusal of @entity8 's national politicians to move on gun control before @entity2 represents a political failure and a paucity of @entity8 will , then the disregard for the lives of inner - city youths stricken by gun violence on a daily basis is an illustration of the limits of @entity8 compassion			1
the slaughter of young children en masse should be a moment of reckoning for any society , but there is a day - by - day , child - by - child slaughter occurring in @entity8 that has gone on too long and is yet to be reckoned with			1
if @entity2 should teach us anything , it is that all of us in @entity8 share this same short moment of life , and that we all seek to ensure safety , security and prosperity for our children			1
as vice president @entity274 and the presidential task force meet to negotiate about what new gun laws to recommend , they must look to @entity2 and beyond			0
we need to protect the children of @entity2 from the threat of future gun violence , but the children of @entity46 and @entity13 and @entity47 deserve the same long - term security			1
we may not be able to ensure absolute security for @entity8 's children , but through smarter policy @entity8 can surely save more of its children from gun violence			1
follow @ @entity288 on @entity289 .			0

while @entity8 was mourning @entity2 victims , guns were claiming lives elsewhere in @entity8
**authors** : media focus on mass shootings , but continuing violence also needs coverage
they say inner cities suffer an epidemic of gun killings , and young are particularly *vulnerable*
**authors** : there is a day - by - day slaughter of children that must be stopped
