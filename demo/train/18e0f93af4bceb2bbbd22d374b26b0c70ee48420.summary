@entity21 said the new standards would " prevent 91 % of mercury in coal from being released in the air			0
" the @entity37 ordered the @entity2 to make the rules final by november			1
companies have three years to comply , but some could get a one - year extension if the technology can not be installed in time			1
the @entity43 and @entity44 are expected to have broad health benefits , according to the @entity2			1
