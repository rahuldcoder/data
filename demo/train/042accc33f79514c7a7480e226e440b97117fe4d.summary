-- i was working at my desk in @entity3 , following race reports from @entity6 on @entity7 , wondering as i do every year if i 'll ever be fast enough to qualify			1
the elite runners had long ago crossed the finish line and the back of the pack was ambling along when the door burst open and several colleagues rushed in			1
" there 's been a bomb at the marathon ! " my heart sank			2
i knew they were telling me as a journalist , but i heard it as a runner			2
new details , new questions in @entity6 for well over a century , @entity6 has been hallowed ground for those of us who run			1
@entity6 is where the endless miles of training -- in rain , heat and snow -- lead			1
@entity6 is where the agony of the hills and the brutality of the stopwatch are pounded into submission by 26.2 miles of glory			1
it does not matter if you finish first or last			2
simply being in that legendary race is the goal			2
forever dreaming of it is the reality for most of us			2
and then , in 12 horrific seconds , a sporting event that has inspired , challenged and rewarded @entity46 for more than a century was turned into something awful , ugly and painful			1
5 viral stories that are n't true make no mistake : any decent runner in the land will tell you that nothing about the race even slightly matters compared to the suffering and grief of those people caught in the blasts			1
some runners who had just covered nearly the whole course were among the first to rush over and offer aid			1
no matter how many years of effort they 'd spent to reach the race , they knew there were real victims here , and the finish line did n't matter anymore			0
i have covered many explosions , massacres , wars , natural disasters and horrific accidents			0
i know that human loss should always trump all else			0
but i 've also learned that sometimes other things are lost , as well , and even if they do n't matter as much as the human suffering , they matter just the same			0
take the pledge to run for @entity6 and for so many of us who take to the roads , paths and trails , the essence of running is freedom ; our freedom to step outside , stretch our legs and fly along the ground wherever we choose for as long as we please			1
it is a celebration of human ability and excellence			0
and this was an attack on all of that			0
the point of terrorism is to terrify , to drive us all away from the open roads , to force us into hiding , to make us shrink from each other and from public spaces , to make us run ... away			1
the human spirit is still alive i worked all day covering the blasts			0
i collected information on the victims , the investigation and the hunt for suspects			0
i checked in on friends who 'd been at the race			0
the phone rang late as i was finally wrapping up			0
it was my older daughter at @entity117 we marathoned together a few years back , and we still join each other for races whenever we can			0
" how are you , " i asked			0
" not great , " she said			0
" it 's all so sad			0
i went for a run			1
and i know she was not alone			0
i know as sure as i breathe that in all the depressing , bewildering hours since the attacks , that this has been the answer from runners all across our land			1
they have strapped on their shoes , stepped outside and in silent tribute they have run			1
they have run in defiance of those who would presume upon our freedom			2
they have run in respect for those who died or who were hurt cheering on this silly sport we love			2
they have run as we 've always run , to test the limits of human possibility ; not to defeat others , but to improve ourselves			2
they have run as i will run ... for @entity6 .			1

for many runners , the bombings in @entity6 have left a unique wound
the peace of the road was *shattered* in 12 seconds of horror
" the point of terrorism is to terrify ... to make us run ... away . "
