-- @entity1 may have voted no on independence , but 16 - and 17 - year - olds offered a resounding yes to the question of whether young people can be motivated to take part in the political process after being allowed to vote for the first time			1
with voter turnout reportedly edging close to a remarkable 90 % in some areas , many are pondering what we can expect from the youth vote in the upcoming @entity18 midterm elections			1
as members of @entity18 's largest generation , the millennials , young voters certainly made their mark on @entity18 politics when they turned out in force and paved the way for @entity27 to win the @entity29 caucuses in 2008			1
in fact , if that vote had taken place only among caucus - goers over 30 , @entity30 would have won @entity29 ( and likely would be president today )			1
six years later , however , a different picture emerges			0
rather than being empowered to remain active in politics after making history in 2008 , young voters are sadly becoming more disillusioned and distrustful of all things @entity41			1
in our most recent @entity45 survey , only 23 % of 18 - to 29 - year - olds indicated they would " definitely " be voting in november -- a number that has grown smaller as the election nears and that trails the benchmark from 2010			1
meanwhile , trust in almost every institution tested annually in our survey has also fallen since the last midterm campaign : trust in the presidency is down 12 percentage points to less than one - third , trust in both @entity54 and the federal government is also down -- to 14 % and 20 % , respectively			1
meanwhile , the number of young voters who believe that elected officials seemed to be motivated by selfish reasons has increased from 54 % in 2010 to 62 % today			1
the factors leading up to @entity27 's runaway victory against @entity65 in 2008 were clear			2
the older millennials were raised in the shadows of the patriotism @entity18 felt after 9/11 ; they felt let down by president @entity70 's handling of @entity71 and the march to @entity73 , had witnessed two razor - thin presidential wins in 2000 and 2004 and quickly connected with the first - term senator 's powerful combination of message and media			2
young voters came out in force then , turning red states to blue because in their mind , in this one instant , politics mattered			2
for millions , the election of 2008 was their chance to become an active participant in an unfolding chapter in @entity18 's proud history			0
the same went for @entity1 on thursday , with the vast majority of teenagers over 16 voting because it mattered to them as well			0
like their cousins in @entity18 , they imagined a time telling their grandchildren what it was like the day everyone voted			0
the problem today is that through word and deed , it seems like every elected member of our government is going out of his or her way to illustrate to young people that government does not matter , that the fundamental challenges of our time are better left for others			0
this is why youth turnout has fallen in every election since @entity27 's first			2
in a poll we released a few days ago for @entity122 , for example , we found that millennials are less likely than every other age group to vote in november , they are less enthusiastic about the election , and more than 60 % disapprove of the way that each party is doing its job in @entity54			2
it is impossible to have an election without choices , even bad ones			0
this week @entity1 chose to remain part of the union rather than forge its independence , a choice with real consequences			0
unfortunately , young @entity18 voters by and large just do not see the midterm elections offering legitimate choices because , in their eyes , @entity54 has proven to be largely ineffectual , and worse uncaring			1
by eschewing regular participation in electoral politics , young people are making the choice to serve their community and country in other ways , namely through volunteerism			0
it is now up to the president and members of the @entity152 and @entity153 to take heed of this disillusionment and make a choice to inspire our largest generation to be civic - minded , to participate in the debate and process of politics working together to make our country a better place			0
in fact , when you step back and think about it , it really should n't be a choice at all .			0
