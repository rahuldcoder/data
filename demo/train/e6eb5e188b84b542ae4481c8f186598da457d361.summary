-- @entity1 can trace her @entity3 awakening to february 11 , 1990 , when she sat on the kitchen counter of the governor 's mansion in @entity7 and watched with her parents as @entity9 walked out of prison in @entity11			1
just shy of her 10th birthday , @entity12 knew then that history was being made and even more , " that the future was being born , " she told @entity0 before leaving this week on a nine - day , six - stop @entity3 trip with her father , former president @entity12			1
now she is part of that future she envisioned more than 23 years ago			0
the @entity12 , @entity20 and @entity21 is involved in myriad projects in @entity11 intended to help historically disadvantaged people get a chance to realize their human potential on a continent known mostly for squalor and conflict			0
changing both the reality of @entity11 and the perception of its failed progress are important to @entity12 , a self - proclaimed child of advantage raised by wildly successful and famous parents			0
she credits both with helping her better understand the world , quoting her father 's maxim that " intelligence is equally distributed ; opportunity and resources are n't , " while citing travels around the world with her mother -- former @entity45 sen. and secretary of state @entity20 -- that always included time with women and girls in far - flung places such as @entity49			1
" i always got to meet girls who very much were my age and very much were experiencing different things and very similar things that i was experiencing in the @entity45 , " she said , describing encounters that helped her realize " how many more advantages i had by being born in late - 20th century @entity45			2
" it resulted in a simple but profound question that inspires her today : " how could i not have thought about what i could do in my life to try to close the gaps that happened just by accident of where i was born ? " the answer is reflected in her work with the foundation and its various initiatives focused on health care , economic empowerment , climate change and other issues			2
this week 's trip begins in @entity72 , where @entity12 and her father will meet with president @entity74 and tour a @entity76 clinic to visit @entity78 - infected patients being helped by access to less - expensive medicine			1
other stops include @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity11 , a regular destination on her @entity3 travels			2
she spent time there in 1997 with her mother on a trip that preceded her father 's historic visit a year later as the first sitting @entity45 president to go to the country			1
@entity12 and her father also visited @entity11 last year as part of a similar @entity3 swing to visit foundation sites there and in @entity99 , @entity85 and @entity100			2
many of the projects result from work of the @entity104 , a kind of facilitating arm of the foundation that brings together philanthropists , corporations and others seeking to do good with projects and partners that need help			0
" one of the things that we see over and over again is that so often the right constituent parts are n't really that far from one another , " she said			0
" they 're just not connected or organized			0
" so far , @entity104 members have committed to projects and other participation in @entity11 worth $ 27.8 billion , more than a third of the initiative 's total member commitment worth $ 73 billion			0
@entity12 will visit one of the @entity104 projects on friday in @entity82 , where the @entity45 - based @entity127 will work with local authorities to fit hearing aids for people who need them			1
it is part of the @entity135 foundation 's plan to " to give 1 million people hearing aids this decade to restore the gift of hearing , and to make a difference in people 's lives in new ways , " according to its website			1
" it 's not giving a gift of hearing for a moment ; it 's giving the gift of hearing for a lifetime , " @entity12 said of the project , which also supplies batteries and teaches people how to use and maintain the devices to " totally transform the trajectory " of their lives			0
for much of the work of the foundation and the initiatives , success generally means that at some point , their help no longer will be needed , @entity12 explained			0
for example , a coffee roasting plant in @entity85 , which she and her father will visit with @entity85 president @entity168 , will eventually process 3,000 tons a day to create 40 jobs while boosting the income of tens of thousands of farmers , according to the @entity174 website			1
given the nation 's troubled history , with the 1994 genocide still resonant as a symbol of @entity3 upheaval and misery , the coffee plant represents " the next chapter in what 's been really exciting to watch unfold in @entity85 , " @entity12 said .			2

the former president and his daughter will make six stops on a nine - day trip
@entity1 's @entity3 awakening : @entity9 's release from prison in 1990
foundation work closes gaps between her @entity45 *upbringing* , rest of the world
the itinerary includes @entity78 patients , hearing aids and a coffee - roasting plant
