@entity0 -- @entity3 lawmakers investigating a phone hacking scandal tuesday asked media baron @entity6 , his son @entity6 and former @entity8 editor @entity7 to testify before them , hours after former @entity3 prime minister @entity2 accused their newspaper group of illegally obtaining private information about him			1
@entity14 's @entity13 asked the three to appear in a week , on july 19 , a representative told @entity1			2
" senior executives " of @entity6 's @entity3 newspaper company " will cooperate , " @entity15 said in a statement , without specifying who			1
if the @entity22 and @entity23 do not answer the summons , @entity14 can compel them to do so , @entity21 lawmaker @entity20 said on @entity25			2
he added that he believes he too is a hacking victim			0
the chairman of the committee , @entity26 , told @entity1 that he has plenty of questions to ask			0
" the first thing is that @entity31 has said he has discovered that @entity14 , and that means my committee , was misled by some of the executives who have given us evidence in the past , " he said			0
" so we will obviously want to know who has misled @entity14 and what it was they said which was untrue			0
" meanwhile , a @entity43 source told @entity1 the @entity3 coalition government will vote in favor of a parliamentary motion by the @entity21 opposition calling on @entity48 to withdraw its bid for satellite broadcaster @entity50			1
@entity26 predicted any vote would be lopsided , if not unanimous , against the elder @entity6			1
" i would have thought that , if @entity14 sends a signal as strong as is likely , he would be very foolish to ignore it			0
" officials must first establish who authorized the " very serious criminal activities " under scrutiny , @entity26 said			0
" anybody who was complicit in that , who knew about them , potentially is vulnerable			1
" the news represents a further threat to @entity6 's plans to create @entity3 's largest media company by acquiring the satellite broadcaster			1
@entity48 has been seeking to buy the 60.9 % of the @entity50 shares it does not already own			1
labour leader @entity67 and deputy prime minister @entity68 are among lawmakers who have already urged @entity6 to reconsider the bid			1
@entity2 , speaking tuesday to the @entity71 about allegations that @entity73 illegally obtained private information about him , accused @entity6 's newspapers of having " links with criminals			1
" @entity2 said the paper appeared to have gotten access to his legal files			1
he said he was " genuinely shocked " by its methods			0
the @entity73 denied @entity2 's allegations and said it pursued the story about him in the public interest			1
" we were told that mr. @entity2 had bought a flat cheaper than any normal valuation and that he obtained it through a company in which @entity91 , a close ally , had been a director , " it said tuesday in a statement			1
" we had reasonable grounds to investigate this matter ... we believe no law was broken in the process of this investigation , and contrary to mr. @entity2 's assertion , no criminal was used and the story was published giving all sides a fair hearing			1
" @entity2 's allegations , however , widen the scandal that brought down @entity3 's best - selling newspaper , @entity8 , to other newspapers also owned by @entity6 's @entity15 media group			1
suspicions that @entity15 would fill the sunday tabloid gap by publishing its six - day - a - week tabloid @entity107 on sundays were reinforced by the company 's acquisition on monday of the domain name thesunonsunday.co.uk			0
@entity15 's parent company , @entity48 , announced tuesday it would buy back $ 5 billion of its own shares over the coming year , after a fall in its share price since the phone hacking scandal exploded last week			2
@entity117 officers testified before lawmakers tuesday about their investigation into illegal breaches of privacy by @entity8 , following accusations police did not probe deeply enough when they first looked into matter			1
assistant commissioner @entity124 , who concluded in 2009 that there was not enough evidence to pursue an investigation , admitted to the @entity128 that his decision was " crap			0
" and he said he believed his own phone had been hacked " in the period 2005 - 2006			0
" he blamed @entity15 for not handing over all the documents they had			0
but lawmakers hammered his decision			0
" why did you not look at the information that was sitting in bags at @entity139 ? " demanded conservative lawmaker @entity135			0
@entity124 insisted he had " never , ever , ever " received a payment from a journalist , but said it was " highly probable " that there were some corrupt officers among the 50,000 in the @entity117			0
@entity15 is accused of attempting to bribe police officers for information -- including personal contact details for members of the royal family -- in addition to the violation of privacy allegations			0
@entity124 said he did not see @entity2 's name on a list of potential hacking victims when he examined the evidence police had in 2009			1
the accusations that journalists working for @entity15 papers went after @entity2 were published monday by rival outlet the @entity160			1
the @entity160 said the tabloid @entity107 -- the country 's best - selling daily newspaper -- obtained details about @entity2 's son 's health and published a story about him , while people working for the broadsheet @entity73 tricked the former @entity21 leader 's accountants into handing over financial details			1
both papers are part of the @entity15 stable			0
the company denied that @entity107 illegally obtained information about @entity2 's son			1
" we are able to assure the @entity2 family that we did not access the medical records of their son , nor did we commission anyone to do so , " @entity15 said in a statement			1
it said its story about @entity2 's son " originated from a member of the public whose family has also experienced cystic fibrosis " and wanted to highlight the plight of those afflicted with the disease			1
" the individual has provided a written affidavit this afternoon to a lawyer confirming this , " the statement said			0
the efforts to obtain information about @entity2 and his family dated back some 10 years , and include periods when @entity2 was prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer , according to the @entity160			1
@entity2 declined several @entity1 requests for an interview about the allegations			2
the latest allegations follow sunday 's closure of the @entity8 over other allegations of illegal breach of privacy			2
the decision to pull the plug on the 168 - year - old paper came amid accusations that its reporters illegally eavesdropped on the phone messages of murder and terrorist victims , politicians and celebrities , as well as claims it may have bribed police officers			0
police said thursday they had identified almost 4,000 potential targets of phone - hacking			0
@entity0 's @entity117 monday angrily blasted leaks from its investigation into illegal eavesdropping by @entity8 , shortly after @entity3 media reported that the paper tried to bribe royal protection officers to get private phone numbers for members of the royal family			2
police said @entity15 had shared information about alleged efforts by reporters to bribe police , and that both sides had agreed to keep the information confidential			0
police said they were " extremely concerned and disappointed " at the leaks , which they said " could have a significant impact on the corruption investigation			0
" police , the royal family and @entity15 all refused to answer @entity1 questions about allegations that a reporter sought company money to pay a royal protection officer for the confidential details about the royal family			0
the controversy over phone hacking has continued despite the shuttering of @entity8			2
@entity6 has not apologized to the family of a murdered @entity3 teenage girl whose phone messages were illegally intercepted , a lawyer for 13 - year - old murder victim @entity263 's family said monday			2
@entity23 has been promoted to chief executive of @entity15 , and @entity6 has stood by her			2
@entity6 flew sunday to @entity0 , hours after the final edition of @entity8 hit the stands			1
the publication was the first @entity3 national paper murdoch bought , in 1969 , as he began to propel himself from @entity271 newspaper proprietor to international media magnate			0
with its closure , @entity15 now owns the @entity107 , @entity274 and the @entity73 in @entity3			2
@entity6 's @entity48 also encompasses @entity275 , @entity276 , the @entity277 and @entity279 publishers			2
@entity1 's @entity280 , @entity281 and @entity282 contributed to this report .			0
