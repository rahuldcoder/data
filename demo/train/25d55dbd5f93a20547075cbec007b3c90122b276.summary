-- hundreds of white supremacist groups are active in the @entity3 today and are experiencing a kind of resurgence , experts say			1
they are in the spotlight this week in the wake of a deadly shooting at a @entity10 temple outside @entity11			2
authorities have said they are looking into whether the gunman , who was killed , had ties to such a group			1
who are @entity10 ? " i know they 're out there			0
i try not to alarm the public too much , but it 's something that really needs to be taken a hold of now because more and more we see facts coming out that this is happening more often and more often , and it 's not going to stop anytime soon , " said @entity18 , who worked as an undercover informant on extremist groups for the @entity21			1
currently , there are more than 1,000 hate groups in the @entity3 , according to the @entity32 , which tracks them and says it was tracking the @entity35 gunman for years before the attack			1
@entity38 @entity37 , 40 , was a " frustrated neo-nazi , " said the center			0
his tattoos included the @entity44 cross adopted by white supremacist groups , and he was a member of two " racist skinhead " bands , it said			1
in addition , he was associated with @entity49 , according to @entity50 , director of the center			1
" hammerskins are the scariest , most violent skinhead group out there			1
so @entity37 was in the middle of a scene that really was very violent , hyperpolitical			1
and he was not on the fringes of this scene			0
he was really in the thick of it			0
" on its website , @entity49 says it is " a leaderless group of men and women who have adopted the @entity64 lifestyle			1
" it adds , " we must secure the existence of our people and a future for @entity69			0
" @entity70 , a professor of sociology and criminology at @entity73 in @entity74 , pointed to several factors behind the strength of white supremacist groups , including a flagging economy and the election of the country 's first black president			1
" during tough economic times , the credibility of mainstream , conventional institutions and leaders declines dramatically and what happens is that more and more @entity3 have given up resolving their problems in the middle and have gone to the extremes , " he said			1
remembering the shooting victims but there 's a twist			0
while the number of white supremacist groups is rising , the overall impact on membership is not clear , said @entity70			1
that 's because the groups , while there are more of them , are smaller , he said , adding that their splintering makes the cells more dangerous and difficult to disrupt			1
" it 's harder for the @entity21 to find an informant			0
it 's more difficult for them to infiltrate			0
a small number of good friends can do incredible damage , " said @entity70			0
@entity110 , director of investigative research at the @entity111 , said right - wing extremism is experiencing a resurgence			1
but to grow , white supremacist groups have to buck a long - term trend toward inclusion , he said			2
" for the white supremacist movement to expand , that 's swimming upstream			0
" a kinder , gentler @entity120 ? and that 's hard			0
according to @entity70 and @entity18 , one of the principal ways the groups recruit is through far - right music			1
" the music is a very creative tool and a very important tool for bringing in the youth			2
they bring in these kids that are on the outskirts of society that feel rejected by society ... they brainwash them into believing that hate is the way to go and following them is the only way to go , " said @entity18			2
" there are many teenagers who commit what i would call thrill hate crimes , " said @entity70			2
" often , they 're inspired by the white power rock lyrics and the literature of white power groups			2
they may not themselves be members of these organizations , but they are influenced by them			0
" in such a way , white supremacist groups can have an impact greater than their numbers			2
" we have 300 million ( people ) in this country , so even the fringe of the fringe is a lot of folks , " said @entity110			0
@entity50 said he believes that in the coming months and years , " we are looking at the very real possibility of more domestic terrorism along these lines			0
we 've seen it in @entity166 as well as here			0
i think this is accelerating , not decelerating			0
