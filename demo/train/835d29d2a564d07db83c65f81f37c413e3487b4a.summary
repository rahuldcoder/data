@entity2 @entity0 is again up against the wire on a bill to avoid a government shutdown			2
but last - minute brinkmanship , which has become the norm on @entity8 , could be in the rear view mirror by thursday afternoon if @entity10 can find enough @entity11 to help them approve a mammoth spending bill			1
@entity14 battles among @entity15 on spending bills are nothing new			0
house speaker @entity17 routinely needs @entity11 to help him pass funding bills			1
but this time house speaker @entity19 does n't seem in the mood to help			0
" if we do n't finish this today , we 're going to be hear ' til @entity24 , " @entity17 threatened at a @entity8 press conference			0
@entity11 and @entity15 leaders brokered a deal on a $ 1.1 trillion spending package to fund the government through september and head off a government shutdown , but many liberal democrats are bailing on the package			1
eleventh hour additions of two policy provisions on campaign finance and banking rules have enraged those on the left who now say the bill is a special interest boondoggle			0
related : surprises hidden in spending bill the final gasp of the lame duck session is also a pivotal moment for @entity19 , who has publicly criticized the bill and called for those two items to be removed			1
@entity15 leaders have refused to make any changes			0
the top @entity10 @entity49 has sent strong signals she 's vote against the bill , but @entity11 leaders were n't officially urging no votes from their members			1
" these provisions are destructive to middle class families and to the practice of our democracy , " @entity19 said wednesday , making it clear the bill was unacceptable			0
securing support from a significant chunk of @entity11 is critical for @entity10 speaker @entity17 because many of the conservatives in his party - as many as 60 -- will likely oppose it			1
they have insisted the spending bill should try to reverse president @entity70 's recent executive actions on immigration			1
@entity15 leaders opted to postpone the immigration fight until next year , leading members on the right say they 'll vote no. related : @entity11 backlash threatens spending deal it 's a gamble for @entity10 @entity11 if they join unhappy @entity10 and take the spending bill down			1
if it fails to pass @entity15 leaders , who have no appetite for a government shutdown , will move quickly to pass a three - month extension of current funding levels for federal agencies			1
those items that @entity11 negotiators fought to get included in this legislation -- and the @entity15 policy changes to gun laws and environmental policies they opposed and blocked -- will be lost			2
democrats would lose any leverage they had on any new deal early next year when both the @entity10 and @entity96 are controlled by @entity15			1
we fought , " said sen. @entity98 , @entity99 , the chair of the @entity100 and one of the chief negotiators on the spending bill			1
" you know - sometimes you give a little , you take a little			0
" many @entity10 @entity11 emphasize they were initially concerned with the spending deal because it only funds the @entity108 through february			1
@entity108 includes immigration and border control agencies			0
a new funding battle for @entity108 in february would tee up a fight over president @entity70 's immigration action early next year			0
the other policy provisions added to the spending bill - one increasing the limit rich donors can give to national party committees , and one rolling back a key financial reform barring banks from using taxpayer - insured money for derivatives trades - have made it even more unpalatable			1
" at this point i do n't see many @entity11 votes at all for a bill that is so antithetical to the middle class , " rep. @entity126 , @entity128 - @entity127 , told @entity1 before heading into a meeting on the measure on thursday morning			2
other democrats are taking a more pragmatic approach , stressing they are weighing the good with the bad			0
" this may be a hold your nose vote , " @entity138 told reporters , suggesting he could ultimately back the measure and any deal next year would only get worse for the programs he cares about			0
@entity138 's district is home to tens of thousands of federal workers who got a small pay raise as part of the deal			0
related : lawmakers chip away at campaign finance rules in spending bill the number two @entity10 @entity49 , @entity156 , who is in charge of whipping votes , would n't say how he would vote			1
" we 're holding our powder dry , " @entity156 said			0
@entity10 @entity15 aides feel comfortable that even with large opposition in @entity11 ranks they can get enough votes for the measure to eke out its passage			2
if it passes , the bill will be sent to the @entity96 , where many of the same divisions exist			2
while the debate over the measure will echo the bitter partisan tone that 's been the marker of this @entity0 , one thing unites virtually everyone on @entity8			0
they all hate the name of the bill -- dubbed the " @entity183 " for a combination of a " continuing resolution " and an " omnibus " spending bill			2
" it sounds like a horrible disease , " said one @entity10 @entity15			2
a @entity49 called it the " @entity187			0

government funding is set to run out at *midnight*
*republicans* and @entity96 @entity11 leaders want to pass a *catchall* spending bill to fund the government until september
@entity11 in the @entity10 have *balked* at *language* *tucked* in the bill that would roll out some @entity199 reforms
