-- it 's a first - world problem of epic proportions , and the couch potatoes of the @entity4 are n't pleased			1
just before midnight tuesday , a dispute between satellite provider @entity7 and mass - media company @entity5 led to nearly 20 million customers losing access to 26 channels @entity5 owns			1
on social media wednesday , it seemed like a good chunk of those millions were lashing out , telling the world that they want their @entity18 ... or @entity19 ... or @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23			1
" when my son cant watch ' the @entity28 ' tomorrow he might call @entity7 himself , " @entity25 all - pro cornerback @entity24 posted on @entity26 , referring to the @entity19 animated series			1
some less - famous @entity26 users turned to humor , and @entity33 lyrics , to address the situation			2
" if you got @entity7 i feel bad for you son , i got 999 channels and you just lost some ! " tweeted user " @entity38 from friday			1
" and like any good dispute in the @entity26 - and - @entity42 age , the two principals cranked up an online fight of their own			2
@entity5 retweeted several posts blaming @entity7 for the blackout , many from stars of shows that air on the affected channels			1
it also used the site to accuse @entity7 of refusing to negotiate			1
@entity7 , in turn , hammered home its case , saying @entity5 wants to raise the price of the channels , which would in turn create more expensive service for subscribers			1
it shared a link to its own version of the dispute and a post saying it hopes " to reach an agreement soon & keep your bill low			0
" both companies also were sharing their side with fans on @entity42 , where customers were responding with hundreds of often - angry comments			0
" this is ridiculous , i 've only had @entity7 for 6 months and this is the second time that we 've lost channels that we watch on a regular basis , " one fan of @entity7 's facebook page wrote			1
" get your stuff together and get it settled before it affects us as customers			0
i will be canceling once my contract is up			0
" on its own page , @entity5 took a bit of a cheap shot wednesday afternoon , posting an image of @entity19 cartoon favorite @entity87 with this text : " who lives in a pineapple under the sea ? i do n't know			1
" more than a few @entity42 fans were n't amused by the stunt			0
" @entity94 , @entity5 ! you win the crown for @entity98 of corporate [ expletive ] s ! " one of them wrote			2
" my kids are upset because they ca n't watch @entity87 anymore after you rubbed it in their faces with that lousy commercial you came up with to hurt their feelings and make @entity7 look like a bunch of [ expletive ] s and now here you are making a joke about it			2
you suck ! ! ! ! ! " of course , neither company has the chops to talk smack like a pro wrestler			0
grappling legend @entity111 appears on " @entity112 , " which airs on @entity21			0
he took to @entity113 in a video that makes up in intensity what it lacks in nuance			0
" i 've had a world of piledriving punishment dished out to me , brother , but i 've never been hurt like i am right now since i heard that @entity7 dropped @entity21 , " he says in the video , which had only a modest 3,200 views as of midday wednesday			2
some complaints , of course , were perhaps more self - aware than others			0
" @entity128 ... i want my expensive service to include all the channels i once had			0
thanks , " read one tweet			0
who was that complaining about having to pay so much for blacked - out satellite service ? reality - tv star , @entity136 wife and millionaire heiress @entity134			1
so , what are subscribers to do while the two entertainment titans hash out the dispute ? here are a few alternatives : web services like @entity144 offer the current seasons of many tv offerings , with episodes appearing shortly after they air			1
@entity23 's " @entity152 " and " @entity153 " and the @entity155 's " @entity154 " are just a few of the top offerings listed under @entity144 's " @entity151 " feature			0
and right now , @entity144 is offering a free one - week trial -- so if you get lucky , you might be able to ride out the spat without paying anything extra ( @entity134 , take note )			2
@entity161 , @entity162 and other providers offer current tv series as well			0
so , worst - case scenario , even if you ca n't get the latest episode of your current favorites , you can review past seasons or catch up on those shows you 've been meaning to check out .			2

subscribers take to @entity4 to *bemoan* @entity7 @entity5 blackout

stars of shows on the networks led the social - media charge complaining
