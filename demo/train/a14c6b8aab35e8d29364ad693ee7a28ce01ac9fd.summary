-- taking the devilish element out of one of @entity4 's most iconic but endangered animals could save it from extinction			0
evolving to be less aggressive could be the best hope for saving @entity7 in the wild , suggest scientists from the @entity10 , in a new study			1
the species is facing extinction from @entity14 ( @entity14 ) , an infectious cancer that is spread by the animals biting each other			1
it is believed that the cancer has wiped out over 60 % of the animals since it was first discovered in 1996			1
while the animals are solitary they are social and meet regularly either during mating , establishing social hierarchies , or when feeding around carcasses			0
on all occasions they bite each other			0
however , the recent study led by @entity28 , published in the @entity30 's @entity29 , led to the surprising discovery that the less a @entity7 gets bitten the more likely it is to become infected with the cancer			1
" our results --- that devils with fewer bites are more likely to develop @entity14 --- were very surprising and counter-intuitive , " he said			2
" in most infectious diseases there are so - called super-spreaders , a few individuals responsible for most of the transmission			0
but we found the more aggressive devils , rather than being super-spreaders are super-receivers			2
" over a period of four years , @entity28 and his research team studied the animal at two locations in @entity50 and discovered that most of the tumors found on @entity7 were located in their mouths			1
" this means that more aggressive devils do not get bitten as often , but they bite the tumors of the less aggressive devils and become infected , " explained @entity28			0
there is currently no vaccine or treatment for @entity14 and once infected @entity7 do not live much longer than six months			1
one of the study sites -- @entity60 in western @entity50 -- was less badly hit by the disease , leading @entity28 to feel hopeful that further research there could aid the survival of the species			0
" firstly , we need to explore the genetic differences that might be lessening the impact of @entity14 in the @entity70 population , " said @entity28			2
" second , we need more detailed data on devil behavior to define ' shy ' or ' bold ' types			0
we could then use this information to develop a management strategy to reduce the spread of the disease by boosting natural selection of less aggressive , and therefore more resilient , devils			2

cancer spread through biting is threatening wild population of @entity7
new study found most aggressive were most likely to contract disease
currently no treatment for @entity14 ( @entity14 )
*estimates* of 60 % *decline* of wild population since @entity14 discovered
