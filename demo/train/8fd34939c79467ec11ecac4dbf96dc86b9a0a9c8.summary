@entity0 , @entity1 -- as our car moved closer to this tiny village in eastern @entity1 , our driver became visibly nervous , looking around for any signs of trouble			1
" they spotted us , " he said , hitting the gas			0
in the rear - view mirror , an unmarked black sedan appeared out of nowhere , trailing us as we drove past the main entrance to @entity0			0
that 's the hometown of @entity16 , a prominent human rights activist whose escape here last week from house arrest has set off diplomatic reverberations worldwide			1
who is @entity16 ? @entity22 traffic cones blocked the narrow path off the main road ; a half - dozen burly men stood guard with numerous vehicles parked behind them			1
despite the green trees and fields , the tight security around @entity0 looked no different from what it looked like during the past two winters , when we previously had tried to enter the village			0
in february and december of last year , we had come here to visit @entity16 after he recounted in a video posted online the abuse he and his family suffered during their confinement at the hands of local officials			1
each time we were turned back at checkpoints , where plainclothes guards hurled rocks or or threw punches at us			2
@entity16 , 40 , a blind and self - taught legal advocate for alleged forced - abortion victims , escaped last week after being imprisoned at home for more than 18 months			1
he is now believed to be in the @entity52 in @entity53 , creating a burgeoning diplomatic dilemma between @entity1 and the @entity55 that coincides with a visit by @entity55 secretary of state @entity57			1
she arrived wednesday morning in @entity53			1
@entity16 affair could overshadow @entity55 - @entity1 talks @entity16 's wife , mother and daughter , who were incarcerated with him but did not escape , have vanished from public view			1
in a video released online friday , @entity16 expressed his deepening worry for the safety of his family			1
" they have been persecuting my family for a long time and my escape would only prompt them into a mode of revenge , " he said			0
we had come here again on tuesday to find @entity16 's family -- but could n't get close			1
with the black sedan tailing us , our driver refused to slow down			2
he overtook trucks on the wrong side of the main road and raced through open - air markets on bumpy dirt paths			0
we had hired him in a nearby town -- and it had taken a lot of cajoling to persuade him to take the job			2
" it 's too risky , " he protested en route to @entity90			1
" i 've heard of @entity16 -- he campaigned against the family - planning policy and was under house arrest			1
" " i do n't know too much , " he added quickly			0
" you should ask people from his town -- they know all about him			2
" after an hour 's high - speed car chase , during which our driver failed to shake our tail , he decided he 'd had enough			1
he dropped us off near a gas station , then he sped off as three policemen approached his car			2
while waiting for a new car , we chatted with a trucker who had told us he was from @entity16 's town , but offered little news			1
" @entity16 ? " he asked , appearing uncomfortable hearing the name			1
" i spend a lot of time away and do n't know much about what 's going on here			0
" as we started driving in a new car , our tail resumed its close surveillance			0
this time , instead of trying to lose them , we decided to try to discover their intention			0
we stopped at a roadside farmer 's stall , where i bought a watermelon			0
then , @entity2 's @entity121 and @entity122 -- each of us carrying a slice of watermelon as a sort of peace offering -- approached the @entity128 carrying our pursuers as cameraman @entity130 shot video of the scene that was unfolding			1
the two men seated in the front of the car covered their faces with their hands and ignored my knocking on the driver 's window			1
i then knocked on the backseat passenger window			0
a man sporting a white shirt and sunglasses rolled down the tinted window slightly			0
he refused to identify himself , but denied following us			0
" we were just driving around for fun , " he said			0
" is this about @entity16 ? " @entity121 asked in @entity148 and i translated			2
" i do n't know who @entity16 is , " he replied			2
" do you want a slice of watermelon ? " i offered			0
" no. " he looked awkward , rolling up the window			0
as we walked away , someone yelled " stop ! " from behind			0
turning around , we saw that all three men had gotten out of the car and were rushing toward us			2
scuffling ensued as they tried to grab @entity130 's camera from his hands			0
amid the chaos , we broke free with our camera and jumped into our car			0
one of the men picked up the watermelon i had bought and launched it at our car			2
with pink juice splashed across the rear window and the black car behind us again , we sped off toward the expressway back to @entity53 -- wondering about @entity16 's escape and his family 's fate .			1

a @entity2 team attempts to visit @entity16 's hometown of @entity90
the mention of @entity16 's name seems to *provoke* awkward and *evasive* *reactions*
their driver fails to elude men following them in a car , finally gives up and *abandons* them
the team 's attempt to question their followers ends in a scuffle -- and a retreat back to @entity53
