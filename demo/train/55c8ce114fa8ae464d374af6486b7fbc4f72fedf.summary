@entity0 , @entity1 -- the mood around @entity4 in @entity1 's capital was very somber sunday as thousands gathered , mourning the dozens of people killed in demonstrations during the past week and wondering who will take charge of the politically divided nation			1
they wondered where president @entity13 , who reportedly tried to leave the country saturday night , had gone			1
no one in the government appeared to know			0
there was a great uncertainty in the country after the rapidly moving events of the past 24 hours , which saw @entity22 oust @entity13 , free his political rival @entity23 from prison and schedule elections for may			1
it appeared that two political forces were trying to establish control of the country : the opposition and @entity13 , who maintains that he is still president and still in control despite fleeing to the eastern part of the country			1
clearly , though , his power has been greatly diminished @entity37 , parliamentary leader of @entity13 's @entity38 , condemned the ousted president on sunday in a video statement , blaming him for the " robbery and deception " of the nation			1
the former ruling party blamed @entity13 for illegal orders that led to casualties , financial debt and shame in the eyes of the world , @entity37 said			2
it also remains to be seen how @entity52 -- @entity13 's ally -- will respond with the @entity54 in @entity55 closing on sunday			1
@entity56 changes to political scene @entity23 , the former prime minister , was freed after 2Â½ years in prison saturday and returned to the capital in a development many could n't have imagined as dawn broke that day			1
she went to @entity4 and had strong words for @entity13			2
" today , @entity1 has finished with this terrible dictator , " @entity23 told the cheering crowd			1
she served as prime minister from 2007 until she was forced out of office in 2010 after losing the election to @entity13			1
a year later , she was sentenced to seven years in prison after being convicted of abuse of authority over a natural gas deal negotiated with @entity52			2
the @entity72 considers her case politically motivated and has called her " a political prisoner			0
" she is considered a hero of a 2004 revolution that forced the results of a presidential election won by @entity13 to be thrown out			2
where is the @entity80 ? last we heard , @entity13 was in @entity82 , a @entity83 stronghold near @entity1 's border with that nation			1
he tried to leave the country by plane but was turned away , authorities said			0
the country 's acting interior minister said sunday that government officials in @entity0 do n't know the whereabouts of @entity13 and two of his top ministers			1
on saturday , the president and his entourage attempted to board a charter flight without proper documentation in the eastern city of @entity100 , according to the head of @entity1 's @entity102 , @entity103			1
he was on the tarmac when he was turned back by security forces , @entity103 said			0
but the president took to television airwaves , saying he 's still the legitimate leader			2
he said he was forced to leave @entity0 because of " vandalism , crime and a coup			0
" " i do n't plan to leave the country			0
i do n't plan to resign			0
i am the legitimate president , " he said from @entity82			0
may elections @entity22 voted to oust the president and hold new elections on may 25			0
it also appointed @entity115 , the speaker , to take on @entity13 's duties until then			1
lawmakers also fired several ministers , including the foreign and education chiefs			0
but who will lead the nation is still a big question			0
@entity23 announced sunday that she does n't want to be considered for the nomination for prime minister , according to a statement posted on the @entity128 website			1
the opposition coalition is a chaotic mix of voices , each working to assert dominance			0
former world champion boxer @entity133 has been the most well - known opposition figure during the crisis			0
he heads the @entity136 party			0
but the opposition bloc goes well beyond @entity133 and his party			0
then there 's @entity140 , another opposition figure and former foreign minister			0
last month , the president offered a package of concessions under which @entity140 would have become the prime minister and @entity133 deputy prime minister on humanitarian issues			1
@entity52 's influence the series of concessions started friday with @entity22 overwhelmingly approving the return of the nation 's 2004 constitution			2
reinstating it gives the president less power -- a key demand of protesters who 'd taken over @entity160 for weeks -- and paves the way for lawmakers to appoint key ministers			0
close ally @entity52 has been busy hosting the @entity54 , which end sunday			0
but it 's closely linked to the crisis , which started in november , when @entity13 scrapped a @entity167 trade deal and turned toward @entity52			1
@entity52 offered to lend money to @entity1 in a deal worth billions of dollars and lower its gas prices			2
the deal sent protesters to the streets as @entity52 pressured @entity13 to crack down on demonstrators			2
on saturday , @entity52 's ambassador to the @entity176 , @entity175 , condemned what he called @entity72 attempts to influence the outcome of the tumult in @entity1			1
" either they do n't understand the consequences of what they 're doing , or they 're engaged in a very provocative game of destabilizing @entity1 and therefore @entity189 , " @entity175 said in a post on his official @entity183 account			2
@entity175 has accused the opposition of wanting to take power by force			0
" if those so - called democratic opposition leaders come to power on the shoulders of thugs , that will not produce democracy in @entity1 , " he said			0
on sunday , @entity200 secretary of state @entity199 and @entity52 foreign minister @entity201 spoke about the situation in @entity1			1
according to written statement from a senior @entity206 official , @entity203 strongly prodded @entity207 to accept the results of the @entity22 's decisions			2
@entity199 also asked @entity52 to work with the @entity200 and the @entity167 on enabling " critically needed reforms " and to not use military force in the country , which shares a border with western @entity52			1
