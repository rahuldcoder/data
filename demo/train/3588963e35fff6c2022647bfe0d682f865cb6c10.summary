the campaign of airstrikes against @entity2 in @entity3 has pitted several @entity5 countries into action alongside the @entity7			1
analysts say the involvement of leading @entity11 nations in a fight against the @entity11 extremism of @entity2 is crucial			0
" i think that 's very important going forward as it does show that we 've got some regional buy - in , it shows that there are @entity5 countries willing to put their reputations on the line , " said retired lt. col. @entity14 , an @entity15 veteran intelligence officer and @entity17 military analyst			0
but there are also some @entity7 allies and regional powers that are conspicuous by their absence from the new phase of the conflict with @entity2			1
here 's the lowdown on who 's taking part and why -- and who 's staying on the sidelines			0
who 's in @entity40 : the largest and most influential @entity42 nation has fought with @entity7 forces in previous conflicts , including @entity45 in the 1990s			1
@entity2 ' rapid gains in @entity3 and @entity47 have raised alarm in the oil - rich kingdom			1

it has received large numbers of refugees across its borders with both countries			0
@entity55 's involvement in the airstrikes is part of its " position on combating terrorism and protecting its security and borders , " @entity55 government spokesman @entity66 told @entity74			2
the country also claims to have strong intelligence resources on @entity2			0
@entity77 : the country was previously reported to have offered to support the @entity7 attacks against @entity2			1
it is also hosting @entity82 combat jets on its soil			0
the @entity77 contributed aircraft to the international coalition that intervened in @entity86 in 2011			2
@entity87 : a key @entity7 ally in the region , the island nation of @entity87 houses the @entity92 's @entity91			1
as a regularly participant in @entity7 - led coalitions , its involvement in the airstrikes is n't surprising			2
@entity96 : the @entity42 nation had already flown a number of humanitarian flights to help @entity101 efforts in @entity47			1
but its involvement in the military strikes in @entity3 significantly raises its commitment			2
@entity96 has strained relations with @entity40 and the @entity77 over its willingness to provide refuge for members of the @entity110 , which espouses a political islam feared by several other governments in the region			1
who 's not @entity115 : a @entity120 member and one of the hardest - hit countries by shock waves from the @entity3 civil war , @entity115 's absence from the first wave of airstrikes will raise some eyebrows			1
the country is absorbing vast numbers of refugees from the conflict and is seen as a major transit point for foreign fighters joining @entity2 and other armed groups			0
until recently , the country had one strong reason to stay out of military action against @entity2 : 49 of its citizens , including senior diplomats and their families , were being held hostage by the militants			0

@entity157 : the @entity158 is a hugely influential player in both @entity3 and @entity47 , where it supports the @entity161 - led governments			1
@entity2 ' @entity11 extremism is a fierce challenge to @entity157 's sway in the region , but @entity167 's long - standing tensions with @entity168 make any link to the coalition extremely tricky			0
earlier this month , supreme leader @entity171 rejected the idea of cooperation , accusing the @entity7 of planning to use military action against @entity2 to " dominate the region			2
" @entity176 : a close ally to the @entity7 in recent conflicts in the @entity148 , the @entity176 says it is n't involved in the airstrikes on @entity2 in @entity3			1

@entity191 : the @entity191 military began airstrikes against @entity2 in @entity47 last week , using @entity194 fighter jets to attack a logistics warehouse			2
