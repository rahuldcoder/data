-- @entity1 will not play in next week 's masters after undergoing successful back surgery , the world no. 1 announced tuesday			1
the 14 - time major winner will miss the tournament for the first time since making his debut at @entity9 as an amateur in 1995			1
on monday , he had an operation on a pinched nerve " that has been hurting him for several months			1
" " after attempting to get ready for the masters , and failing to make the necessary progress , i decided , in consultation with my doctors , to have this procedure done , " @entity14 , who has donned the green jacket on four occasions , said in a statement			1
although the surgery was successfully performed in @entity24 by neurosurgeon dr @entity25 , @entity1 now needs to rest and rehabilitate for " the next several weeks			1
" " i 'd like to express my disappointment to the @entity9 membership , staff , volunteers and patrons that i will not be at the masters , " the 38 - year - old added			1
" it 's a week that 's very special to me			0
" it also looks like i 'll be forced to miss several upcoming tournaments to focus on my rehabilitation and getting healthy			2
" i 'd also like to thank the fans for their support and concern			0
it 's very kind and greatly appreciated			0
this is frustrating , but it 's something my doctors advised me to do for my immediate and long - term health			0
" @entity1 has been struggling since last year with the back injury , which has severely hampered his game in the opening months of 2014			1
in early march , the condition forced him to stop playing after 13 holes of his final round at the @entity51			0
when he tried to return to action the following week at the @entity53 in @entity54 , he aggravated the injury when tweaking his back			2
on march 18 , he withdrew from the @entity57 , explaining that neither the back spasms nor pain had subsided and telephoning @entity60 personally to apologize for his absence			2
this year 's masters begins on thursday april 10			2
the course is a special place for @entity1 , who won his maiden major at @entity9 in 1997			1
beating the field by an astonishing 12 strokes , the then 21 - year - old announced his arrival in imperious fashion			0
he has won the coveted green jacket another three times since : in 2001 , 2002 and 2005			0
an indication of @entity1 ' devotion to the masters is that he made his long - awaited return to golf in 2010 at @entity9 following the well - documented breakdown of his marriage			1
the tournament had been the only major he had never missed , with a succession of injuries ruling him out of the @entity84 , the @entity85 and the @entity86 at various times since 2008			0
' @entity88 ' in a statement on his website , it was suggested @entity1 will " begin intensive rehabilitation and soft - tissue treatment within a week			1
" the aim is for one of the game 's most legendary figures to return in the summer , with the press release stating that " @entity14 could have sustained further damage if he had continued to play			0
" despite the disappointment of missing one of his favorite tournaments , @entity1 remains focused on cementing his place in the golfing firmament			1
" it 's tough right now , but i 'm absolutely optimistic about the future , " said @entity1 , whose last major came in 2008			2
" there are a couple [ of ] records by two outstanding individuals and players that i hope one day to break			0
" as i 've said many times , @entity115 and @entity116 reached their milestones over an entire career			0
i plan to have a lot of years left in mine			0
" nicknamed ' the @entity124 ' , 70 - year - old @entity124 ' record of 18 career majors is the main target in @entity1 ' sights			2
meanwhile , @entity128 , who died in 2002 at the age of 89 , won more @entity131 titles than any other golfer but his 82 victories are just three ahead of @entity1 ' tally			1
both players ' careers spanned at least 25 years , so allowing @entity14 -- who turned professional 18 years ago -- plenty of time to chase his targets .			0
