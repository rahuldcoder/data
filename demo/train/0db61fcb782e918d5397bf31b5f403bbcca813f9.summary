@entity7 's maneuver did n't appear to temper @entity3 's outrage			1
" the last - minute statement by mr. @entity7 's representative put out late yesterday only confuses the issue , " she said			1
" instead of stating clearly that @entity29 will be allowed to compete , mr. @entity7 qualifies it by adding conditions that are ambiguous			1
" she asked @entity7 for " a clear answer -- not a wimpy , wishy - washy type of answer -- but something that we can take to the bank			2
" @entity3 did n't know it then , but @entity7 gave a clearer statement to @entity1 in @entity92 two hours earlier			2
