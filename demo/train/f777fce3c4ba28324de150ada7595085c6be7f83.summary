@entity0 -- @entity3 winner @entity2 has pretty much got this acting thing down			1
after all , he started acting at the age of 15 and , well , he 's got that @entity3			2
@entity2 says that @entity3 are " not as important as children and making them happy			1
" so he does n't really need to deliver another gut - wrenching performance to demonstrate his chops			0
in fact , he can deviate from a traditional film and venture into animated territory			0
he 's voiced animated characters in the past , but in @entity15 's new 3 - d tale " @entity13 , " @entity2 lends his voice to a mole			1
speckles the star - nosed mole comes to life thanks to the film 's impressive digital animation and @entity2 's voice			1
at first it 's unclear that @entity2 is the voice behind @entity25 , because he changes his sound for the critter , er , character			1
@entity1 talked to @entity2 about playing a mole , animated films and his taking walks in the forest			1
the following is an edited version of that interview : @entity1 : what do you play in this film ? @entity2 : i 'm playing @entity25 , the mole , and he 's an outsider			1
he 's an iconoclast -- he does n't fit in			2
he does n't get into the fray with the " @entity13 , " the other guinea pigs			1
but his iq is off the charts , and he 's a technological wizard			2
@entity1 : so , you 're an @entity3 - winning actor , and you decided to play ( this role )			2
how did this come about ? @entity2 : to me , nothing 's more sacred than the magical world of children , and with everything that 's going on in the world , it gets increasingly more challenging to keep our kids smiling -- people are losing their jobs , families are tense			1
so anything i can do to give families something to look forward to and to put a smile back on children 's faces -- i 'm gon na do			2
@entity15 has a great tradition of enchanting children and giving them something to behold			1
i mean , you mention @entity3 -- i mean , that 's not as important as children and making them happy			2
@entity1 : tell me about your voice : why did you decide to really change it when you read the script ? @entity2 : @entity79 is a hero because of what he could do with his voice for all the @entity82 , the @entity84 cartoons , to be the voice of @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89			1
to me , he 's a great actor			2
i mean , one of the great character actors , and i knew that if i was gon na be in this movie , i 'd want to do something like that and transform my voice			2
@entity1 : so you 're clearly comfortable playing a mole ? @entity2 : i 'm comfortable with the mole , yeah			1
i mean , yeah , he 's different , he 's got issues , you know ? i do n't want a perfect character , i want a character who has , as strange as it sounds , some humanity , some flaws , some needs			1
but to be fair , i 'm not in a lot of this movie			0
this is @entity110 's movie , um @entity111 and @entity113 's movie -- they 're the stars			1
i 'm only in it at the beginning and the end			0
@entity1 : you seem to be a big fan of animated films			0
@entity2 : i do enjoy animated movies			1
i really love anime and movies like " @entity124 " and " @entity125			0
" i like movies where you feel like you 're going into another world , and no matter how many times you watch it , you 're gon na see something new in that world			1
that level of detail really inspires me			0
@entity1 : is there less pressure doing an animated film and lending your voice to a character as opposed to a traditional film ? @entity2 : well , you do n't have the pressure of the camera			1
and that 's -- that 's very liberating			0
and you do n't have the pressure of other actors trying to remember their dialogue or not being in rhythm with you			0
the challenge though is , these movies take years to make , and i may not be in the same state of mind i was in a year ago or two years ago , and then they tend to pull you out of wherever you are and put you back in a box , and then try to get the voice out of you again , so that 's the rub			1
@entity1 : have you gotten pretty good at honing your skills when it comes to choosing roles , or is it always a risk ? @entity2 : i mean it is always a gamble			1
you never know what 's gon na happen with a movie			0
but i think it 's more of a matter of , am i doing something that i believe in on any level ? like , am i going to entertain children , or am i going to make a movie that i can stand by because it means well on some level ? that 's becoming more and more a part of the criteria			0
@entity1 : how do you think you 've changed as an actor throughout your career ? @entity2 : i think i 've become more relaxed			2
i do n't feel the need to jump up and down and make a big noise to get people to pay attention to me			0
i do n't need to um , you know , do punk rock gestures or eat a cockroach or do something weird to say i exist			0
i feel like i 'm hearing a different kind of sound now			0
it 's a much more subtle sound , but it 's still a truthful sound , that i can express myself in , in roles that are much more relaxed and seasoned as opposed to boisterous and rock and roll			0
@entity1 : what 's inspiring to you , in every day			0
@entity2 : well , i find children inspiring			2
the way they look at the world			0
the magical world they live in , to me , is inspiring			0
i like -- i mean , i 'm afraid i 'm gon na answer your questions and sound like a complete nature addict here , but uh , i like nature , i enjoy going for walks , i like the ocean , i like the forest			0
@entity1 : is that what you do when you 're not working , that 's important to you in your life ? @entity2 : yes			1
yes , i like to go for walks in the forest .			0
