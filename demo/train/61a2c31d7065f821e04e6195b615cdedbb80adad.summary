-- bedevilled by a series of corruption scandals , football 's world governing body @entity3 has come to an " historical crossroad			1
" that 's the verdict of @entity3 vice president @entity7 , ahead of a meeting of the governing body 's executive committee in @entity11 next week			1
@entity12 , the former head of the @entity13 , wants a key report into alleged corruption into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 @entity17 made available to the public with names redacted			1
@entity7 , who is also president of the @entity20 , says @entity3 has a " responsibility " to ensure reform is carried out			2
" as a self - regulated body , the world of football finds itself at a historical crossroad , " @entity7 told @entity0			1
" following the @entity20 independent investigative report , made public in april of 2013 , the mandate of openness and transparency became a reality			0
" the regulations that govern the @entity34 should be aligned with the premise of safeguarding its current reform process			0
" i support the publishing of the @entity42 , appropriately redacting to respect prior witness confidentiality agreements , " added @entity7 , referring to @entity37 , the @entity38 lawyer who investigated the 2018 and @entity40 bidding process for @entity3			1
" we have a responsibility and an opportunity to manifest the promise of reform			0
" @entity7 is not the only senior football figure to call for the report to be published with names redacted			1
@entity52 , the head of @entity54 football , has also called for such measures as has @entity56 , president of @entity57			0
according to @entity3 's agenda for next week 's meeting , @entity12 's proposal will be discussed as point 13.1.3			1
the @entity61 wants his colleagues to agree to a change of the ethics code which currently prohibits the publication via @entity66			0
@entity61 press agency @entity67 quoted @entity12 as saying : " i would like to see this ban relaxed so that the @entity3 executive committee , as well as the public , in an appropriate form , can be informed of the contents of the investigation			1
" a @entity3 spokesman told @entity0 that the matter would most likely be carried out by a vote but would depend on the proposal made by @entity12			2
last month , @entity3 judge @entity78 released a 42 - page summary in which he cleared @entity80 and @entity81 of any wrongdoing in their winning bids to host the 2018 and 2022 @entity17 respectively			2
but within hours of the announcement , @entity37 made known his displeasure with the findings by labeling them both " incomplete and erroneous			0
" with both men unable to decide how much information should be made public , the matter has been passed onto @entity92 , the independent chairman of @entity3 's audit and compliance committee			0
according to the @entity3 agenda for next week 's meeting , he will address members on how much of the 430 - page report should be made public			1
earlier this year , @entity99 , @entity3 's legal director , told reporters that it would be difficult to sustain witness confidentiality if the report was published			2
" the code of ethics is based on certain principles , one of which is confidentiality , " said @entity99			0
" cooperation between witnesses and the ethics committee is based on confidentiality -- if not perhaps certain witnesses , whistle - blowers or other parties might not cooperate to such an extent			0
" however , two whistle - blowers were subsequently identified following the publication of @entity78 's summary			0
since @entity78 's findings were made public , @entity3 has faced a barrage of criticism over the way the entire episode has been handled			0
@entity125 , president of the @entity126 , warned that @entity128 's 54 member nations could leave @entity3 if the report into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 was not published in full			2
his remarks came just before the @entity132 demanded @entity3 hand over a copy of the report , while @entity136 , chairman of the @entity137 warned that " urgent action " must be taken to restore confidence in the world governing body .			1
