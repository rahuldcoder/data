the @entity0 on thursday approved a waiver provision that gives a student athlete with @entity3 a chance to continue participating in sports despite being 19 years old			1
under the new provision , @entity6 , who will be a senior in the fall , could be approved to play as early as august if the @entity9 formally seeks a waiver for him , said @entity11 , spokesman for the athletic association			1
" i just want to say thank you for everybody to support me through all of this , " the rising senior told @entity15 affiliate @entity14 , a smile spread across his face			0
@entity6 's father , @entity21 , told @entity15 that he hopes other states will follow @entity0 's lead in offering an exception to sports age limits for students with disabilities			1
" i feel relieved , " @entity21 told @entity15 in a telephone interview thursday afternoon			0
" it 's been two and a half years			2
we 've been petitioning and working with the association			2
" he said he 's looking forward to " just watching @entity6 run down onto the field in the first football game this fall			1
if he can contribute to the team , even better			0
the same goes for basketball season			0
" " the hardest part has been the stress of not knowing whether or not it 's going to be @entity6 's last season , " he added			1
he said he is " almost positive " that his son will be granted a waiver in august			0
" it was just a matter of keeping the faith and believing in what you 're doing , " @entity21 told @entity14			0
" i think things are meant to happen , and this was just meant to happen			0
that 's all we wanted -- was just a shot at letting the schools actually decide for themselves as to how they want to run their sports programs , and this was how they want their sports programs run			1
" " he 's doing it because he loves me , because he just wants to watch me play sports in my last year , " @entity6 said			1
the student 's underdog quest to keep playing sports in @entity0 's @entity63 garnered widespread attention because he has shown flashes of athletic prowess despite his @entity3 , such as when he hit a three - point shot in the basketball playoffs to help his team maintain a comfortable lead			1
in football , he also kicked an extra point near the end of a game a couple of years ago			0
however , the athletic association 's executive committee must first set up a waiver process , which is scheduled to be finalized in june , @entity11 said			1
once the process is established , @entity78 can apply for the waiver for @entity6 in august , @entity11 said			1
without the waiver , @entity6 would n't be able to play sports next school year , he said			1
" we fully expect @entity78 will apply for a waiver , " @entity11 told @entity15			0
the waiver provision is an amendment to the association 's constitution			1
it allows student athletes who turn 19 before september to play sports under " narrowly defined " circumstances			1
@entity94 required a two - thirds majority of votes cast , and 94 % of the 701 senior and junior high schools and middle schools that cast legal ballots approved the change , the association said			1
there are 1,535 schools in the association			1
under the new waiver rule , a student " must have a defined disability documented to diminish both physical and either intellectual or emotional capabilities , does not create a health or safety risk to participants , and does not create a competitive advantage for the team			0
the burden of proof rests with the school seeking the waiver , " the association said in a statement			2
said @entity120 , the association 's executive director , in a statement : " our challenge now is to demonstrate to the negative voters and to those many schools which did n't cast a vote at all , that this is a narrow gate that preserves the integrity of the program as effectively as the previous rule that was so well understood and respected			1
" the age restriction is intended to prevent the possibility of injury or competitive advantage from an older , more developed athlete playing against younger students			0
@entity6 turned 19 in january			1
he was held back in kindergarten because of his disability			0
the athletic association did not mention @entity6 by name , but it had recently released a statement that appeared intended to deflect criticism over the way it has handled the question of his participation			1
an online petition on @entity149 that was started on march 24 now has more than 80,000 signatures			0
@entity151 , a t - shirt store in @entity153 , is selling shirts that say " let ' em play			2
" the basement in the @entity158 home was transformed into a mini gym and is what the student refers to as his " man - cave			0
" it contains a weight room , a net for him to practice kicking field goals , and a basketball hoop			0
@entity6 has played sports with other children in @entity153 since he was in elementary school			2
" we did n't know how far he 'd go , how many coaches would keep him on the team , " @entity21 said earlier this month			0
when he got to high school , @entity6 was invited to keep playing			2
as a junior , he was on the school football and basketball teams			0
he attended every practice , worked out with the other players and sometimes played a few minutes at the end of a game			0
during this season 's basketball playoffs , @entity6 brought the house down			2
with the team maintaining a nice lead over rival @entity189 , the coach put @entity6 in the game and he hit a three - point shot			2
" i was on the left side behind the three - point line and they passed me the ball , " @entity6 said , smiling as he recounted the game in a recent interview			1
" i heard the fans , including my mom crying			0
" @entity6 's father was in the stands with his camera and captured the reaction			2
" i videotaped the crowd on the other side and it was made up of mostly @entity208 fans , including their student section , and they were all on their feet cheering for @entity6			2
" @entity6 got a similar reaction two years ago when he kicked his first extra point for the football team toward the end of a game			2
" i was amazed that he even had the opportunity to kick , and then when he did it , i thought woo - hoo ! and then watching the kids react , they carried him off the field ; it was just one of the best moments , " @entity6 's mother , @entity220 , recalled			1
for the past two years , the @entity228 , with the support of the @entity9 , have tried to get the rule changed so @entity6 could play during his senior year			1
" the rule is 100 years old , " said @entity21			0
" we 've come a long way in those 100 years in this country in the way that we involve and include people with disabilities			0
and i think it 's time that the rule catches up with that			0
