@entity0 , @entity1 -- four years ago this village was the center of " @entity6 mania			1
" the celebration of 2008 " was exceptional , it is something not any of us would have imagined to have happened because we were at the brink of history being made , " said village resident @entity6 , half - brother of the president			1
in 2008 , @entity6 peered into a tiny tv with a flickering @entity2 signal for an all - night vigil watching results come in			1
after a rain - soaked night that stranded more than a few reporters who had come to the village , @entity6 emerged bleary - eyed but dancing			1
a crowd of supporters chanted his name			0
@entity0 is the birthplace of @entity23 's father , @entity24 then - sen. @entity23 visited in 2006 and paid special homage to his grandmother , @entity28 ( now universally known as @entity29 )			1
it 's not just @entity29 and @entity6 , there is a whole wing of the @entity6 clan here : cousins , aunts and half - cousins			1
if 2006 was the start of the love affair , in 2008 it went full - blown			0
everywhere there were @entity6 t - shirts , dvds and cakes ( a black forest cake with an edible picture of the president - to - be and @entity29 was a favorite )			2
things have certainly cooled down since then			0
to many @entity53 ( and @entity54 , if polls are correct ) , @entity23 's presidential campaign of " hope " and " change " hit a wall of reality when he came into office			1
@entity53 , in particular , saw great hope in the new @entity54 president with @entity53 roots			0
but after just one brief swing through @entity64 in four years at the @entity65 , many feel let down by @entity53 's " favorite son			0
" the administration contends that @entity53 is a priority , and secretary of state @entity69 has been a regular fixture in @entity53			0
but to @entity53 , and especially to @entity1 , it is not the same			0
" under the circumstances with what he has had to deal with we understand , " said @entity6 , " and we hope that circumstances will change			2
we hope he has the opportunity to come here and say hello			0
" even without a visit from president @entity6 , @entity0 is still trying to make good use of the connection			1
where there was once just a dirt track running through town , now a paved road is nearing completion			0
electricity is connected to many houses			0
simply put , president @entity6 's win put @entity0 on the map			1
locals here say that charities flooded into @entity0 to get a bit of the " @entity6 cache			1
" with a tight race looming in 2012 , many here are nervous			2
" i donÂ¹t know the other person who is contesting , " said pastor @entity101 of the @entity102 in @entity0 , " but we know @entity23 is the son of this land			1
" @entity101 , a fiery preacher who delivers sermons with a translator in a staccato double act , said his congregation has been praying for " peace , the economy , and @entity23			2
" everyone a @entity2 crew spoke to in @entity0 is for @entity6 : the fruit vendors ; the commuters streaming by in matatu , or minibus , vehicles ; and even the opinionated boda boda , or bicycle and motorcycle , drivers			1
many just refer to @entity122 as " the other guy			0
" while @entity0 has changed , with a new recreation center and lodge for foreign tourists , it is still just a rural village some 260 miles ( 418 kilometers ) west of @entity129 , the capital			2
the flood of foreign visitors predicted by the government has n't materialized , and the much - touted road is n't quite finished			0
" @entity134 , is the capital of the @entity54 , but @entity0 is the capital of the world , because everybody comes to visit , " he said .			2

the village of @entity0 was the birthplace of president @entity6 's father
in 2008 the village celebrated " @entity6 mania "
@entity23 's win put @entity0 on the map
now , with a close election looming , many are nervous
