-- @entity1 wants to take you back in time			1
the nominees for the 84th annual @entity1 were announced tuesday morning , and if there 's a theme , it 's how many nominations hearken back to previous eras in film history			1
among the best picture nominees alone , there 's a silent film ( " @entity21 " ) , an @entity23 throwback ( " @entity24 " ) , a film that pays tribute to film 's early days ( " @entity16 " ) and even that most distinctive of comedy types , a @entity19 film ( " @entity20 " )			1
if either " @entity16 " or " @entity21 " -- two films - about - films -- wins , it would be a groundbreaker , says longtime @entity1 watcher @entity30 of @entity31			1
" no film about @entity37 has ever won best picture , " he says , observing that classics such as " @entity33 " and " @entity34 " could n't pull off the trick			0
( " @entity34 , " in fact , lost to a film about @entity41 -- " @entity42			2
" ) " @entity16 , " the story of a young boy and his adventures among clocks , trains and interesting people , led all nominees with 11 nods			1
" @entity21 , " a silent film that borrows a plot from " @entity33 " and images from a host of movie classics , was second with 10			0
complete list of @entity1 nominees the sheer number of nominations makes the pair front - runners for best picture : in the last 20 years , the film with the most nominations has won 15 times , observes @entity30			1
but neither has created much heat with audiences -- or the @entity1 , says @entity68 reporter @entity67			1
" everyone 's been waiting for the one film to really catch them and they can all get behind , and that never seemed to happen , " she says			0
" you see that reflected in the nominations			2
it feels diluted in a sense			0
even though ' @entity21 ' and ' @entity16 ' are leading the pack , i do n't think anyone would call ' @entity16 ' a front - runner			1
" old hands and snubs the @entity1 also paid tribute to its own past			1
some of the names behind the best picture nominees -- @entity19 , " @entity16 's " @entity89 , " @entity24 's " @entity90 , " @entity96 's " @entity97 -- evoke the 1970s , when @entity37 was energized by the arrival of a new breed of filmmaker , one raised on genre classics and foreign films			1
except for @entity97 , who 's been nominated only twice before , the rest have become @entity1 veterans			1
other nominees are also old hands at the game			2
@entity103 added a couple more nominations -- one for acting ( " @entity107 " ) and one for writing ( " @entity106 " ) -- to his haul			1
@entity109 ( " @entity110 " ) and @entity19 are well into double digits for @entity1 nominations			1
on the other hand , one of the most renowned filmmakers of recent years -- the music - video - and - tv - commercial bred @entity116 -- was overlooked for both best picture ( " @entity119 " ) and best director			2
indeed , @entity1 did n't smile on everyone			1
@entity121 -- another 1970s - era name -- was widely touted for a supporting actor pick for his performance as a brutal mobster in " drive , " but came up empty , no doubt providing more material for his neurotic comedy			1
@entity128 , who gave two of the best - reviewed performances of the year in " @entity131 " and " @entity132 , " was also overlooked , as was @entity133 ( " drive , " " @entity106 " )			0
@entity134 , who has adapted all but one of @entity139 's @entity138 novels for the screen -- and been widely hailed for capturing the books ' detail and humor -- did n't get a nomination , either			2
to date , @entity134 ' only nomination has been for his adaptation of @entity148 's novel " @entity149			0
" and perhaps most shockingly , @entity150 was shut out of best animated feature for " @entity152 " -- the first time the famed animation studio has been snubbed in the category			1
" that sends a powerful message that they need to up their creativity in their movies , " says @entity30			0
" they 're rubber - stamping their past successes with things like ' @entity152 , ' and they 're being punished at the @entity1 today			2
" audiences felt the same way : of @entity150 's 12 features , " @entity152 " is 11th in total box office , and dead last if the take is adjusted for inflation			1
in recent years the @entity1 has n't cared about box office as much , anyway			1
" the @entity171 , " which won best picture two years ago , topped out at $ 17 million domestically			0
of this year 's best picture nominees , only " @entity178 " was a blockbuster , topping $ 100 million ; " @entity21 , " despite its reviews and honors , has yet to make $ 15 million domestically			0
the wide net indicates the power of the " screener , " says @entity30			0
@entity183 members had to catch all the movies in theaters			0
now they receive dvds -- or screeners -- at their homes and can see a broader range of possibilities			0
" there 's a very noticeable trend , " says @entity30			0
" lately they 've been paying attention to these screeners , and the box office does n't matter			1
they 're trying to send another statement			0
" such nominees as @entity200 , who picked up a best actor nomination for " @entity202 , " probably owe their slots to these marketing efforts			2
the @entity1 glow which is one reason the @entity1 still matter			2
audiences at home might ask , " who is @entity210 ? " but to agents , casting directors and promotion execs , the words " @entity1 nominee " can make a difference			2
there 's a reason you now see @entity220 ( " the @entity171 " ) and @entity222 ( " @entity223 " ) in bigger roles			0
this year , the talents to watch include @entity225 ( " @entity119 " ) , @entity226 ( " @entity178 " ) and the two stars of " @entity21 , " @entity228 and @entity229			0
and @entity230 , who nabbed a best supporting actress nomination for " bridesmaids , " has certainly gotten a career boost			0
the actress already has an emmy for " @entity236			0
" the @entity1 nomination was a " pleasant surprise , " says @entity67			1
still , the major nominees ' low box office could hurt the ratings for the @entity1 broadcast , scheduled for february 26			1
traditionally , audiences like to have a rooting interest , and it 's hard to root for films that most people have n't seen			0
in the last five years , the @entity1 ' best rating came in 2010 , when box office champ " avatar " was up for best picture			1
( host @entity252 , always a popular figure , could help			0
) will the nominations boost the box office ? if " @entity16 " and " @entity21 " ca n't build on their grosses now , they probably never will , says @entity67			1
her @entity260 tv critic colleague , @entity259 , finds @entity1 bait wanting			2
" film is suffering from ' who cares syndrome , ' " she said last week			0
" ' @entity21 ' -- the seven people who saw it liked it			0
yet the @entity1 rejects ' @entity138			2
' that should win best picture , i think			0
" unless the boy who lived can pull the ultimate wizard 's trick , that 's not going to happen .			0

@entity1 nominations reference old films , old names
" @entity16 " and " the *artist* , " leading nominees , look back at @entity282 era
no nomination for @entity150 -- a first for the animation studio
box office for major nominees has been low -- will nods help ?
