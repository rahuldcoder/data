-- five purported @entity2 splinter group members , who are suspected in a string of hair - cutting attacks on @entity2 men and women in their community , are scheduled to be back in court wednesday morning for arraignment , said the sheriff of @entity11 , @entity12			1
four separate incidents are being investigated in the eastern @entity12 counties of @entity11 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 , said @entity18 , the @entity11 sheriff			2
officials report the first assault happened on september 6			0
the last attack was on october 4 , just days before three of the five suspects were arrested			0
the men are accused of breaking into multiple homes and holding the victims down before using scissors or battery operated clippers to forcibly cut off women 's hair and men 's beards			1
@entity34 , 26 , @entity35 , 38 , and @entity36 , 53 , were arrested last friday in @entity11 , @entity18 said			0
@entity37 and @entity38 turned themselves in to @entity15 authorities a few days later			0
all five men are charged with kidnapping and burglary			1
they were released on $ 50,000 bond , which was paid by bishop @entity45 , who , according to @entity18 , is the leader of an extreme @entity2 splinter group			1
three of the suspects are @entity35 's sons ; a third is his nephew			1
@entity18 is not the only one who believes @entity35 may be behind the attacks			0
" this renegade leader is like a cult , " said @entity53 , an @entity2 scholar at @entity54			1
" he ( @entity35 ) masquerades under the @entity2 name , using religion as a way to create a kind of barrier between him and law enforcement			1
" " nothing moves in this ( particular ) @entity2 community unless ( @entity66 ) says it moves , " @entity18 said			1
according to the sheriff , @entity35 instigated the attacks after being " shunned from his faith some years ago			2
" " his behavior contradicts all the standard @entity2 expectation for behavior , " @entity53 said			2
the assaults are considered a particularly egregious offense in the @entity2 society , and can be considered an attack on the @entity2 identity			1
" it 's very shameful , " said @entity53			0
as a symbol of adulthood , @entity2 men typically grow beards after they get married and @entity2 women do not cut their hair , said @entity53			1
the practices are based on biblical teachings , @entity53 said			0
" i do n't know of any other cases like this , " said @entity53			0
" @entity2 - on - @entity2 violence is very rare			2
" @entity53 also pointed out that it 's not correct to call the attacks @entity2 - on - @entity2 violence because @entity35 is not recognized by the mainstream group			1
both @entity15 and @entity11 counties have large @entity2 populations			2
it is rare for the deeply private religious group to involve outsiders in their internal and religious problems			0
but @entity53 said when it becomes serious or involves some kind of violence , they will turn to outside agencies for help			0
this " is a difficult , terrible crime , " @entity18 said			0
" we are doing everything we can do			0

the five @entity2 men face kidnapping and burglary charges
the suspects belong to an extremist splinter group , *local* sheriff says
suspects related to splinter group 's leader , bishop @entity45
attacks were directed against @entity2 identity , notably custom of letting hair grow
