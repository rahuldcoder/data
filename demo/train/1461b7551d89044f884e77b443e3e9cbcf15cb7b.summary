@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity2 demolished @entity1 's dreams of a place in the @entity6 finals with a dramatic 3 - 2 triumph at @entity8 that sent @entity9 through as @entity11 runners - up			1
@entity2 players celebrate their astonishing victory at @entity8 which sent @entity1 crashing out			1
@entity1 coach @entity14 saw his selection gamble backfire in a big way when rookie goalkeeper @entity17 handed @entity2 a crucial early goal			1
and @entity14 paid for the multi-million pound defeat with his job after @entity1 proved second best on the night in almost every department			1
@entity22 sent on @entity23 for his 99th cap along with @entity25 at the start of the second half and they briefly featured in a revival that saw @entity1 draw level			0
at that point they were back on course for the finals with only a point required , but @entity2 struck again -- and @entity9 confirmed their qualification with a slender 1 - 0 victory in @entity36			1
@entity37 scored the all - important goal just before the break to give @entity41 's side victory			1
but the @entity42 survived a missed penalty from @entity44 and the late sending - off of @entity46 to secure their ticket to the @entity48			0
there was an expectant atmosphere inside @entity8 following the life - line thrown to @entity1 by @entity52 after their win over @entity9 on saturday			1
but all that changed after eight minutes when a glaring error by 22 - year - old keeper @entity17 handed @entity2 the lead on a pitch left partly waterlogged by a torrential pre-match downpour			2
@entity60 tried his luck on the unpredictable surface with a speculative 25 - yard effort and @entity64 's @entity17 allowed the dipping drive to bounce in front of him and skid into the net			0
@entity17 was surprisingly thrown into the deep end by @entity14 in place of regular keeper @entity70 having only made his debut in last friday 's friendly international in @entity73			2
the home fans were stunned by @entity17 's howler but @entity1 tried to retaliate in a positive manner			2
@entity77 set up a great chance @entity79 but his angled drive from 10 yards was straight at keeper @entity81			0
the wasted opportunity was put into sharp focus after 14 minutes when another breakaway saw @entity85 double @entity2 's lead			2
@entity87 made a weaving run to the edge of the @entity1 box and the @entity92 player timed his pass to perfection as @entity85 beat the offside trap			0
he kept his cool and calmly rounded @entity17 before sidefooting the ball into the left - hand corner			0
@entity14 sat shell - shocked in his dug - out as @entity1 looked to be throwing away the life - line handed to them by @entity52 after their win over @entity9 -- and they left the field at half - time to a chorus of boos			1
@entity1 's plight became more desperate with the news that @entity9 were leading in @entity36 and @entity14 made a double substitution , bringing on @entity23 and @entity25			1
@entity79 and @entity108 were the men replaced			0
and @entity25 was quickly into the thick of the action , earning @entity1 a penalty after 56 minutes when he had his shirt tugged by @entity113 inside the box			0
@entity115 kept his cool and sent @entity81 the wrong way as he steered his spot kick into the left hand corner to spark an unlikely comeback			0
@entity2 twice came close to regaining their two - goal advantage in the space of 60 seconds			2
@entity124 was relieved when his attempted clearance under pressure from @entity85 went over the head of @entity17 and clipped the top of the crossbar			0
then @entity17 partially atoned for his earlier error with a fine save from point - blank range to keep out a header from @entity85			0
@entity1 were again fortunate when @entity85 got the better of @entity124 but this time @entity17 was able to cling on to his low drive away to his right			0
after 65 minutes , @entity8 erupted when @entity77 brought @entity1 back on level terms with his 14th goal for his country , superbly chesting down a superb cross from @entity23 drilling past the keeper			1
a draw was enough to put @entity1 through , but back came @entity2 to cruelly smash their dreams with a long - range third goal from substitute @entity146 after 77 minutes , which @entity17 got a hand to but failed to keep out			1

@entity1 fail to make @entity6 finals after 3 - 2 loss to @entity2 at @entity8
@entity9 qualified as group runners - up after their slender 1 - 0 victory in @entity36
@entity1 's failure cost @entity14 his job as manager
