@entity0 -- @entity2 choked up with emotion as he read aloud an e-mail he wrote days before @entity6 's death			1
" he was like a lost boy , " @entity2 read			2
" there still may be a chance he can rise to the occasion if we get him the help he needs			0
" the director of @entity6 's comeback concerts testified for a third day wednesday in the wrongful death trial of @entity17 , the promoter and producer of the @entity20 tour			1
" i 'm not ok right now , " @entity2 told the judge			2
" can i have a second ? " judge @entity24 allowed @entity2 to go alone into the jury room for several minutes before returning for more testimony			2
it was one of several times that @entity2 shed tears during testimony that described a weak and paranoid @entity6 six days before his death , but a revived @entity6 in his last two days			1
@entity6 's mother , who is suing @entity17 , also cried as she listened to @entity2			1
the @entity33 contend that @entity17 executives hired , retained or supervised dr. @entity35 , who admitted to police he was giving the singer nightly infusions of propofol			1
the coroner ruled @entity6 's june 25 , 2009 , death was the result of an overdose of the surgical anesthetic , which @entity35 said he was using to treat @entity6 's insomnia			1
@entity35 was convicted of involuntary manslaughter			2
@entity17 lawyers argue @entity6 chose and controlled @entity35 , and their executives had no way of knowing about the dangerous treatments he was giving @entity6 in the privacy of the entertainer 's bedroom			1
but , according to testimony and e-mails , @entity17 execs put @entity35 in charge of @entity6 's rehearsal schedule after @entity2 complained that @entity6 had been missing so many rehearsals that the tour was in danger			1
@entity6 lawyers argued that @entity35 was influenced by a conflict of interest -- created by his arrangement with @entity17 -- to continue dangerous propofol infusions to help @entity6 rest for rehearsals			1
he was $ 1 million in debt and had abandoned his medical practice two months earlier to serve as @entity6 's personal physician for the tour			1
if he failed to get @entity6 to rehearsals , the shows might be postponed or canceled and he would be out of a job , they argue			2
@entity2 : " i felt that we should stop " after a poor rehearsal on june 13 , 2009 , and a missed rehearsal the next day , @entity2 expressed his concern in an e-mail to @entity17 co-ceo @entity77 : " were you aware that @entity6 's doctor did n't permit him to attend rehearsals yesterday ? are @entity80 and @entity81 ( @entity82 , another @entity6 manager ) aware of this ? please have them stay on top of his health situation without invading @entity6 's privacy			1
it might be a good idea to talk with his doctor to make sure everything @entity6 requires is in place			0
" the @entity17 executives later told him they met with @entity35 and put him in charge of getting @entity6 to rehearsals , @entity2 said			1
the director said he was told that if he needed to know whether @entity6 was coming to a rehearsal , he should call the doctor			0
@entity2 was given @entity35 's cell phone number , which he said he programmed into his own phone			1
@entity35 : fast facts after @entity6 was a no - show for another week , @entity2 had a 30 - minute conversation with @entity35			1
" i was told he was creating the schedule and the schedule was n't working , " @entity2 testified			1
" he was my lifeline , so to speak			0
" @entity2 said he was venting his frustrations with @entity6 and was " crying out			2
" while @entity6 showed up on june 19 , " he appeared lost , cold , afraid , " @entity2 said			1
" i saw a @entity6 that frightened me , a @entity6 that was shivering and cold , " @entity2 testified			1
" i thought there was something emotional going on , deeply emotional , and something physical going on			0
" he persuaded @entity6 not to go onstage that night because he was afraid he would hurt himself , he testified			2
instead , @entity6 agreed to watch the rehearsal with choreographer @entity116 dancing his parts			0
@entity6 appeared paranoid and afraid , he said			1
" he was repeating for me not to quit or to leave him			0
he was afraid that i was going to quit or leave him			0
" with just a dozen days left for rehearsals before the touring company moved to @entity121 for the opening , @entity2 testified , he was worried " that all that we had worked for together , @entity6 and i -- this dream , this desire -- was going to fall away			1
" @entity2 testified that on june 19 , he " felt that we should stop " the production , but he was " torn because i did not want to break @entity6 's heart			1
" @entity2 sent a series of e-mails that night and the next morning to @entity17 executives warning that they needed professional help for @entity6			2
promoter grilled about ' smoking gun ' e-mail in @entity6 death trial " there are strong signs of paranoia , anxiety and obsessive - like behavior , " @entity2 wrote			1
" i think the very best thing we can do is get a top psychiatrist in to evaluate him asap			0
it 's like there are two people there			0
one ( deep inside ) trying to hold on to what he was and still can be and not waiting us to quit him , the other in this weakened and troubled state			0
" @entity2 testified that he was called to a meeting with @entity17 ceo @entity17 , @entity6 and @entity35 at @entity6 's home on june 20 , hours after he sent those e-mails			1
@entity35 angrily confronted him , @entity2 testified			1
" he said i had no right to not let @entity6 rehearse , that @entity6 was physically and emotionally capable of handling all his responsibility as a performer and i should be a director and not an amateur doctor or psychologist			0
i should stick to my job and leave the rest to him			0
" @entity6 died while under @entity35 's care five days later , in a bedroom just upstairs from the parlor where the meeting took place			1
" a metamorphosis " a much different @entity6 appeared at the next scheduled rehearsal on june 23			1
" it was miraculous , " @entity2 testified			1
" i was overjoyed at his energy , his state of mind , his enthusiasm , " he said			0
" he had a metamorphosis			0
" @entity35 told investigators he stopped using propofol to induce @entity6 's sleep for the two previous nights -- after 60 nights of it			1
@entity6 lawyers contend that is why @entity6 was revitalized			0
@entity2 said @entity6 appeared to have gotten " real sleep , organic sleep			1
" a sleep expert testified last month that someone can recover quickly from heavy use of propofol , which interrupts the normal sleep cycles			0
all of the symptoms that @entity2 saw in @entity6 on june 19 suggested @entity6 had been deprived of real sleep for weeks , the expert said			2
expert : @entity6 went 60 days without real sleep jurors watched a video of " @entity196 , " the final song @entity6 performed at the june 24 rehearsal -- his last			2
" i love this piece , " @entity2 said as he watched			0
" our boy is gone " @entity2 was standing on the @entity203 in @entity0 the next day when he got a call from @entity17 co-ceo @entity77 telling him @entity6 was dead			2
" our boy is gone " @entity77 told him , he said			0
" i think i was in shock , " @entity2 said			0
" i wanted to believe that it was some weirdo on the phone			0
" @entity2 , who had worked with @entity6 on other tours and projects , testified tuesday that he would have been less likely to agree to direct @entity20 if he had known what happened the day @entity6 was to appear in @entity121 to announce the tour			1
@entity17 ceo @entity17 testified last month that he " slapped " and " screamed " at @entity6 because he was " nerve - racked " on that day , march 5 , 2009			2
@entity17 recounted that it was " a miracle " that a " drunk and despondent " @entity6 finally appeared at the @entity121 event			2
@entity17 was hosting thousands of @entity6 fans and hundreds of journalists for the anticipated announcement , which was to be seen live around the world			0
" i screamed at him so loud the walls were shaking , " @entity17 wrote to @entity17 parent company ceo @entity218			0
" @entity221 ( @entity6 's manager ) and i have dressed him , and they are finishing his hair , and then we are rushing to the @entity226			2
this is the scariest thing i have ever seen			0
he 's an emotionally paralyzed mess , filled with self - loathing and doubt now that it is show time			0
he is scared to death			0
right now i just want to get through this press conference			0
" @entity17 exec feared @entity6 would sabotage his comeback tour @entity17 executives did not tell @entity2 about the incident when they approached him days later to direct the show , he said			2
he would have been " less likely " to accept the job had he known , because of his concern about how the preparation for the tour would affect @entity6 emotionally and physically , he said			0
