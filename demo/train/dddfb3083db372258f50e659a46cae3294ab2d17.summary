@entity2 , the 24 - year - old @entity3 woman who lost both hands and feet to a bacterial infection , is now breathing on her own , her father said			1
" @entity2 is being @entity2			1
she 's cracking jokes , speaking frankly , displaying her usual early morning grumpiness and she has been off of the ventilator for over 10 hours , " @entity6 said in a blog post sunday night			1
though the @entity15 student is still receiving an oxygen " mask , " @entity6 wrote , " the important thing is that she is getting zero breath per minute ( bpm ) assists			1
in other words , she is breathing completely on her own ! how cool is that ? " " bottom line : @entity2 is doing great today			1
" the progress came after a harrowing week , in which @entity6 's remaining foot and both hands were amputated			1
prior to the surgery , a website posting by @entity6 's friend and fellow psychology student @entity28 explained the reason : " @entity2 's fingers and remaining foot will have to be amputated because of dead blood vessels , not because of necrotizing fasciitis , " he wrote			1
surgeons had already amputated a leg and cut out soft tissue from her torso			1
on a @entity40 page dedicated to his daughter 's recovery , @entity6 described speaking with the surgeons before the latest amputations			1
" the hands were endangering @entity2 's progress , " he writes			1
" as always , my decision was simple			0
do whatever it takes to give us the best chance to save @entity2 's life			1
" he then broke the news to his daughter			2
" i took @entity2 's hands and held them up to her face			1
she did n't draw back in horror			0
she knew the condition she was in , " he writes			2
she nodded as he explained the diagnosis given by her doctors			0
asked whether she had any questions , his daughter mouthed , " i 'm a little confused , but i 'll figure it out , " he writes			1
the patient then listened as her father , mother @entity68 and sister @entity69 explained how she would eventually be fitted with prosthetic limbs			2
" she smiled and raised her hands up , carefully examining them			2
she then looked at us			0
we all understood her next three words , " he writes			2
" ' let 's do this			0
' " @entity6 then pays tribute to the strength of his daughter , who has spent days in intensive care at @entity81 in @entity82 , @entity3			1
" a tear rolled down my face as i walked out of her room			0
i was n't crying because @entity2 was going to lose her hands and foot , i was crying because , in all my 53 years of existence , i have never seen such a strong display of courage			1
@entity2 shed no tears , she never batted an eyelash			1
i was crying because i am a proud father of an incredibly courageous young lady			2
" @entity6 's struggle has been followed by many @entity96 , as her family has shared the ups and downs of her battle against the " flesh - eating " bacteria			1
she was with friends may 1 near the @entity103 , about 50 miles west of @entity104 , when she grabbed onto a zip line			2
it snapped , and she fell			0
the accident left a gash in her left calf that took 22 staples to close			2
three days later , still in pain , she went to an emergency room , where doctors determined she had necrotizing fasciitis caused by the flesh - devouring bacteria @entity117			1
she was flown to @entity82 for the first of what has turned into a series of surgical procedures			0
among them has been a tracheotomy			0
her father recounted how her loved ones saw the inevitability of the amputations in the changing color of her hands from day to day			1
" some people may criticize my decision and say we should have prayed over @entity2 and asked @entity133 to heal her hands			1
trust me , this we have done every day , " he writes			2
there is uncertainty about how common such infections are , since no clearinghouse compiles statistics on their incidence			0
but dr. @entity143 , chairman of the @entity144 at the @entity145 , estimates there are fewer than 250 cases every year in the @entity96			0
the reporting of such cases is not required by law			0
the infection is fatal in about one in four cases , the @entity151 says on its website			2
the bacteria are " remarkably common in the water and in the environment , " according to dr. @entity156 , assistant professor of pediatric infectious diseases at @entity145			0
" when it gets into those deeper tissues , it has a remarkable ability to destroy the tissues that surround it in sort of this hunt for nutrition , " he said			0
" when it does that , those tissues die , and you see the inflammation and the swelling and the destruction that can be very difficult to control			0
" meanwhile , a @entity175 woman undergoing treatment for the same condition continues to recover			0
after seven surgeries , @entity179 's family realizes she " still has a long road ahead			0
" " we do n't know what the next day is going to bring , so we 're just trusting the @entity185 , " her brother @entity182 said sunday			0
" we 're taking it one day at a time			0
" @entity179 was healthy when she gave birth to twins on may 7 in @entity104 but went to the hospital near her home in @entity175 a few days later after noticing a rapidly expanding bruise on her leg			0
the twins are healthy , he said .			0
