-- @entity1 may not be the father of @entity3 , but maybe at 63 he can be labeled the grandfather of @entity3 , the @entity5			1
on the eve of the reboot of the franchise , with a younger and more realistic @entity3 , the life president of @entity10 told me about that snowy night in march of 1995 when he reluctantly decided to travel to @entity11 via car from @entity13			2
he is forever grateful that he did			0
@entity1 was being shown around the offices of @entity15 as he was doing due diligence ahead of a possible takeover by @entity10			1
" in the very last room , " @entity1 recalled , " i think you could say it was love at first sight			1
there was this amazing character , on screen			2
it was the very first character with 3 - d model , in a 3 - d that was a female character			2
" for a generation , video games had been 2 - d worlds with the action moving across the screen			1
" here is one with the character moving into the screen			1
and there she was , @entity3			0
and we had to have her			0
up to then , games were played mainly by teenage boys and the games were made were also men , so they tended to make male heroes			2
" @entity10 bought @entity15 and in 1996 @entity3 , with her short trousers and large bust , hit computer screens			0
since then , 30 million copies of @entity5 have been sold , before the launch of the new tomb raider monday			1
but before you think @entity1 lucked into finding @entity3 quietly being designed by @entity54 at @entity15 , this was 20 years in the making			1
@entity1 and his school friend @entity57 enjoyed playing board games , especially role - playing games			1
they started to write role - playing books and eventually discovered the @entity64 game @entity62			2
they got the exclusive @entity67 distribution rights to the board game on the back of ordering just six copies of @entity62 , according to @entity1 , and the set about trying to sell the games to stores			1
" we had to live in a van for three months as we tried to get people to understand this strange role - playing game , " @entity1 told me			1
however , he added , " we never shied away from the challenge			0
we ended up opening our own shops because other people were reluctant to stock the games			0
" that string of stores , known as @entity86 , set them on their way			0
and board games to video games was a natural progression			1
now , with a cbe in the pocket and the honor title of life president for @entity10 -- a brand name now owned by @entity98 -- @entity1 is more of a advocate for the @entity101 video games and film graphics business			1
the @entity101 was once in the top three in terms of games and graphics business , but has slipped to six			1
@entity1 says he knows why			1
" the curriculum was simply teaching children how to use technology , not how to make technology , " @entity1 told me			1
" so it was making digital users , not digital makers			0
" @entity1 and @entity116 , of @entity117 , were asked to make recommendations to the government to transform the school curriculum to teach people how to program , and not just use , video games			1
as @entity1 likes to point out , the @entity101 games and graphics business is bigger than the film industry			1
and the industry supplies the film industry but also the military , among other customers			1
as for the new @entity5 , the reset is a chance to introduce @entity3 to a new audience and make her a more realistic role model			2
" back in the 90s , it was more of a sort of cartoon character , " @entity1 said			2
" and now it 's a realistic character			0
and realism goes to looks , behavior , and everything about the woman is real			0
" that includes @entity3 being younger and with a smaller bust size			0
" in past @entity147 , the combat had not been as real as it might have been			0
so , the decision was made to give it that gritty realism			0
and she was no longer that armor - plated @entity153 - coated hero			0
here was this character that you played as @entity3 , who could sustain damage			0
" but not be raped , @entity1 told me , recalling a misstep by an employee who said last year that one scene could be seen as the prelude to a sexual assault			2
" there was no rape implication			0
there was a threat which she survived by throwing off her adversary			0
" the player has the tools to overcome the man and kill him within seconds , @entity1 said			2
with the reboot now out , it ca n't be long before we read of a new @entity3 film with a new , younger , actress to set the mark for a new franchise			0
then , more games must be on the cards			0

thirty million copies of @entity5 had been sold before the launch of the new @entity5 on march 4
