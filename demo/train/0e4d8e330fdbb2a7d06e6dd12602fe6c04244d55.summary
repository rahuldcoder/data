-- @entity1 and @entity2 may be facing the most tense and delicate moment in their bilateral relationship since the 1989 @entity7 crackdown			1
the reported escape from house arrest of dissident lawyer @entity10 and his apparent flight to the @entity12 in @entity2 , while not yet officially confirmed , would greatly complicate the @entity15 administration 's efforts to keep relations on an even keel in a year already fraught with bilateral irritants			1
both leaderships want stability in the relationship , given the confluence of a @entity12 presidential election and the once - in - a - decade leadership transition in @entity2 scheduled for this fall			2
but this desire has been put to the test			0
there have been tiffs over @entity30 's early support for the @entity32 regime in @entity33 and @entity35 's failed satellite launch and presumed follow - on nuclear test			1
and there was the bungled attempt by the erstwhile security chief of a senior @entity30 @entity41 member to seek refuge in a @entity12 diplomatic facility on the eve of a visit to @entity1 by @entity30 's putative next leader			1
on many levels , the parallels to 1989 are striking			0
after the june 4 bloody crackdown on student demonstrators in @entity52 , another famous @entity30 dissident , @entity53 , became a living symbol of the bilateral conflict over human rights by spending a year in the @entity12 embassy before finally being allowed to leave the country			1
today 's top @entity30 leadership , though not yet as deeply divided as its 1989 antecedent , is struggling to maintain unity following the purge of one of its rising @entity41 stars for his connections to the security chief 's botched flight and lurid allegations of the murder of a @entity71 national			1
recent apparent leaks and counter-leaks to the @entity75 media detailing leadership infighting underscore the charged political atmosphere in @entity2 as party heavyweights jockey for advantage in the wake of the scandal			2
another wrinkle now is the absence of a revolutionary - credentialed paramount leader — manifest in the personage of @entity87 in 1989 — to arbitrate among the competing leadership constituencies			0
add to this cauldron the scheduled arrival in @entity2 next week of a @entity92 - level @entity12 delegation — led by secretary of state @entity93 and treasury secretary @entity94 — for the fourth round of the @entity96 ( @entity96 )			2
if @entity10 is holed up in the @entity12 embassy , it is hard to fathom how the two sides will stay focused on the many pressing geostrategic and economic challenges in the relationship -- especially as they will undoubtedly face a frenzy among accompanying media over @entity10 's status			1
moreover , the @entity30 leadership certainly will view the visit through the prism of another pivotal moment in the @entity7 drama , the state visit to @entity30 of then - @entity112 leader @entity111 , which emboldened the demonstrators and deepened divisions among the leadership			2
of course a game changer from 1989 , and one that seems to constantly surprise the @entity30 leadership , is the power of social media and the @entity119			0
despite a large contingent of foreign media in @entity2 to cover @entity111 's visit in 1989 , the regime still was largely able to pull the plug on the world 's ability to witness the ensuing massacre in real time			0
it is learning in recent weeks that such control is virtually impossible now			0
but this challenge can be a two - way street			0
if media accounts are accurate that @entity10 entered the @entity12 embassy on thursday evening , then @entity12 diplomats had less than 24 hours between his arrival and the story 's explosion on the @entity119			2
this hardly left sufficient time to seek instructions from @entity1 and to approach @entity30 officials about the possibility of orchestrating a face - saving way to end the potential standoff			1
the problem is made worse by the likelihood that many in the @entity30 elite will assume the @entity149 deliberately leaked the information to embarrass the @entity30 government on the eve of the @entity96			2
the @entity154 's liberal wing also is trying to exploit the downfall of its @entity41 archenemy to revive its long - diminished fortunes and push for a new wave of economic and political change			0
their hard - line opponents , however , will see an opportunity in the @entity10 affair to blunt any reformist tide			0
coming on the same day the @entity165 will have tweaked @entity2 's neuralgia about @entity167 by advising @entity168 that it will take a second look at potential sales of new fighter aircraft to the island			0
the news about @entity10 completes the circle for those eager to paint the @entity149 as bent on stifling @entity30 's rise			1
in the past , such cries of " hostile foreign forces " meddling in @entity30 's internal affairs frequently have taken the wind out of the reformists ' sail			1
against this backdrop , the stage is set for a sudden increase in bilateral tension			0
initially presumed to be largely inconsequential , next week 's @entity96 meetings may prove the most critical test of @entity12 - @entity30 relations the @entity15 administration has faced to date			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 .			0
