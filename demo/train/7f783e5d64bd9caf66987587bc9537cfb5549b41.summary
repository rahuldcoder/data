like many small inns in @entity3 , the riverside @entity1 has been run by the same family for multiple generations			1
but few can lay claim to a stretch like this			2
the @entity10 family has been operating this historic @entity12 inn in the @entity10 village in mountainous @entity14 since 1658 , when it was constructed for an ancient samurai ruler as a holiday retreat			1
twenty - nine generations later , the @entity10 family remains in charge			1
there 's a key reason this beautiful property is still going strong after more than 350 years : beautifying baths			1
high quality @entity24 in hot spring - mad @entity3 , this ryokan has earned a reputation for its indoor and outdoor bathing pools , the water for which , pumped in from nearby onsens , is high in sodium bicarbonate			1
devotees refer to this type of onsen water as " @entity35 " -- or beauty bath -- and say it also helps with cuts , burns and chronic skin disease			2
but as i can attest , there 's no denying the waters leave a silky , soft film on the skin post dip , so perhaps there 's something to those claims			0
do they reverse the ravages laid upon us by the cruel hands of time ? inconclusive			0
however , when most anti-aging promises come out of a jar or a needle , @entity1 ( or " @entity54 " ) has the closest thing you 'll find to a fountain of youth			2
guests have two options -- a gorgeous private outdoor landscaped open - air rock bath overlooking the @entity65 or the enclosed shared wooden baths -- one for men , one for women			2
a remarkable history @entity1 is a two - story property that was registered as a " tangible @entity3 cultural asset " in 1999			1
@entity72 , the current owner , says this means they 're allowed to modernize the property to ensure it remains pleasing for visitors ( i.e. improve the sound proofing on the walls ) but the overall structure of the building must not be touched			0
with its dark brown wood floors and staircases , @entity84 rice paper screens and @entity3 antiques throughout , it 's exactly the type of ryokan travelers looking for that quintessential @entity92 experience will love			1
meals -- another excellent feature of the ryokan -- are included in the room rates			0
guests are served traditional multi-course kaiseki dinners and breakfast in their rooms			0
every dish is made from locally grown produce sourced from the neighboring mountains , some cooked in the onsen mineral waters			0
fish is caught from the nearby river			0
all the rooms , which start from ¥ 16,200 ( $ 159 ) per person , are traditional @entity3 - style suites with futons that the staff lay out in the evening			1
the elevated @entity114 ( room built for the ruler ) is where the feudal lord , @entity116 , used to stay and is the top suite in the building			0
a town of samurai descendants there 's an interesting back - story to the @entity10 hot spring village			1
@entity10 was founded by @entity125 ( 774 - 835 ) , the man credited with introducing the @entity127 school of @entity128 to @entity3			1
legend has it he had a dream about a water god , who told him the location of the @entity10 hot spring			2
when @entity125 visited the site that appeared in his dream , he enshrined a statue of @entity139 , the medicine buddha			0
later , a monk named @entity142 came to the village and claimed his skin disease was miraculously cured after bathing in the onsen waters			2
to show his thanks , he rebuilt the hut where the @entity148 was enshrined and named it @entity149			0
a few hundred years on , during the first battle of the @entity154 outside @entity155 in 1180 , famed @entity3 poet - cum - warrior @entity151 no @entity152 was defeated and his troops fled into the @entity14 mountains			1
they settled in the @entity10 area and renamed themselves in honor of the village			1
the owners of @entity163 are descendants of these fighters			0
as @entity3 moved into the @entity92 ( 1600 - 1868 ) , @entity72 became a popular retreat for top samurai warriors , who were drawn to its thermal waters			1
it was during this time that @entity1 was built			2
getting there many travelers visit @entity10 village as an overnight stop on their journey between @entity12 's sacred @entity177 and @entity178 areas , which are linked by the beautiful @entity180 highway			1
there 's a daily bus that runs all year round from @entity183 to @entity10			1
the travel time is 90 minutes , tickets ¥ 1,700 ( $ 16.70 )			0
seasonal buses run from @entity187 , with visitors needing to transfer at @entity189 to the @entity190			0
@entity187 ( @entity192 - bashi bus stop ) to @entity189 is ¥ 1,690 , the @entity193 to @entity194 is ¥ 1,140			0
there 's more info on bus timetable number 7			0
travelers can also book a taxi from @entity187 to @entity10 for ¥ 16,500 ( taxi holds 1 - 4 people ) or ¥ 19,800 ( jumbo taxi for 5 - 9 people )			2
