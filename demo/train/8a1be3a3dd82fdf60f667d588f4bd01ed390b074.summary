@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is a man on a mission -- a mission to find his all time favorite pirate			1
the highly successful businessman , who rose from being a trainer in the locker room to president of one of the most storied franchises of the @entity13 , is on a quest to find the body of @entity1 explorer sir @entity16 , who was buried out at sea more than 400 years ago			1
sir @entity16 was an adventurer and a true pirate of the 16th century			1
@entity16 is credited with being the first @entity1 to circumnavigate the globe			2
he led several voyages , many of them aimed at capturing @entity25 territories and taking their treasure			0
while he made enemies with @entity25 , he enchanted queen elizabeth i , who is believed to have fondly called him " my pirate "			0
but the @entity25 got their revenge			0
@entity16 's voyage to the @entity32 was disastrous , with the @entity25 fleets prepared for the @entity1			1
the adventure was to be his last and in 1596 he fell ill with dysentery			0
dressed in armor , @entity16 's body was placed in a lead casket and thrown overboard off the coast of @entity41			2
days later two ships in the fleet were scuttled nearby , ensuring they would n't get into the hands of @entity16 's enemy , the @entity25			1
now , centuries after he was laid to rest , @entity3 is on a quest to locate @entity16 's coffin			1
" i 'm a businessman with a passion for pirates and i 'm all about taking action on your passion , " @entity3 enthuses			2
@entity3 has invested a great deal of time and money -- somewhere in the region of hundreds of thousands of dollars according to some experts -- into finding @entity16 's final resting place			1
last month he had a major breakthrough			0
armed with high - tech equipment , a team of archeologists and divers and using the information given to him by a researcher he has hired -- @entity3 set about combing the seabed in an area off the @entity41 coast			0
what they came across @entity75 describes as a tremendous find			0
they uncovered two ships that appeared to be burnt out , lying perpendicular to one another , in an area which @entity3 now likes to call ' @entity16 's alcove '			1
they did n't find a name on either ships , or the ships ' bells , yet @entity3 and experts are quite convinced the ships are the " delight " and " @entity90 " -- the two ships in @entity16 's final voyage that were scuttled			1
@entity3 's passion for pirates is colossal			2
what started as a hobby as a child has exploded into a business empire , with books and a @entity101 movie project in the pipeline			0
the @entity104 businessman has even established ' the @entity105 and @entity106 ' to share all the treasures he 's collected over the years			2
but it is @entity16 that he admires and relates to the most			0
" he was an entrepreneur of his day , " explains @entity3			0
" he talked investors into investing into his adventures and then brought back a return on the investment			0
" it 's not just @entity16 's business brain that @entity3 has a high regard for , but also his rise from commoner to knighthood -- a journey not too distant from @entity3 's own			1
" i was a trainer who eventually owned a basketball team			0
that 's unheard of ! " @entity3 , a physiotherapist by trade , made his fortune by building up , and eventually selling , a successful sports medicine business			2
his term as president of the @entity129 will go down in folklore , with the side going from last place to first in @entity13 standings			0
it is @entity3 's dream to one day see @entity16 's body eventually returned to @entity137 and buried in @entity138 with drums sounding and overseen by @entity90 , the monarch who shares the same name as the royal who thought of @entity16 as her own private			1
for the moment though , another mission will require a permit from the @entity41 government to continue diving off its coast			0
however @entity3 believes they ca n't be far off locating @entity16 's coffin			1
while @entity16 would return to @entity1 with stolen @entity25 treasure , for @entity75 he says his lost treasure is @entity16 's coffin and the history behind it			1
" all i can say to my man sir @entity16 is : i 'll be back , " he says .			2
