-- at some 7 billion people , the world can sometimes seem like a crowded place			1
but if the latest estimates are to be believed , then in less than a century it is going to feel even more so -- about 50 % more crowded , in fact			2
such dizzying numbers understandably raise an important question , one that we have been wrestling with at least since @entity11 famously predicted that rising populations would create a food crunch : can the world 's supply of food continue to meet demand ? @entity18 , being marked thursday , seems as good a time as any to wrestle with this question			1
and for once , it looks like there is actually some good news in the fight against global hunger			0
but any attempt to fully understand the magnitude of the challenge -- and to formulate ways we can meet it -- should begin with five key numbers : 805 million : the number of people who suffer from chronic hunger			0
while this number is down about 11 % over the last decade , it still represents an unacceptable proportion of the world 's population			1
10.95 billion : how many people the @entity39 thinks the world is going to have to support by the year 2100			1
this represents a significant upward revision from previous estimates that had pegged the human population as leveling off around 2050 at about 9.5 billion			1
much of this new growth is occurring in @entity47 , where family size remains high and mortality from @entity50 is down			0
33 : the percentage of the world 's food that is wasted before it is consumed by a human being			1
in the @entity56 , this waste occurs thanks to inefficient processing and storage facilities			0
in the @entity56 , consumers and retailers are to blame			0
the @entity39 estimates that global food waste costs $ 2.6 trillion annually			1
2.512 billion : how many tons of food the @entity39 ' @entity65 expects the world 's farmers to harvest this year			1
if this projection comes true , we will be within .50 % of the world 's most bountiful year on record			1
2,868 : the number of dietary calories available on our planet per person per day in 2011 , the last year for which data is available			0
this number has actually been growing , suggesting that the amount of food produced per person has been steadily rising ( in 1990 there were 2,619 dietary calories per person per day )			2
this growth in productivity is especially remarkable considering that the @entity85 's population grew by about 2 billion people over this time			1
most importantly , the number of calories per person per day tells us that there is enough food on the planet for us all			0
of course , the first two numbers paint a sobering picture of the potential food security and sustainability challenges the world faces			2
and when we add in the uncertainties over climate change , then the task of planning and effectively implementing systems and policies that will ensure everyone in the future receives an adequate diet seems a daunting one			0
but the other figures tell a different story , and allow room for some optimism			2
why ? because fundamentally , the data show us that we have enough food			0
we are not up against some irrefutable @entity114 monster			0
what 's more , these numbers prove that hunger is a matter of public policy and everyday behavior and suggest that social collapse , widespread famine and destitution should never be seen as inevitable in a world that wastes one - third of its food			1
ultimately , these five numbers tell us that hunger is a solvable problem			0
yes , famines , droughts and food riots will be an increasing feature of the headlines in the decades ahead			0
but this should not distract from the underlying : the world can have a well - fed future , one where everyone has enough to eat .			2

@entity85 's population set to grow to almost 11 billion by 2100 , @entity39 estimates
about one - third of the world 's food is wasted
there is room for optimism over whether world can feed growing population , says @entity149
