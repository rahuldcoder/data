@entity0 , @entity1 -- the fact that @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 bought more than $ 150 billion worth of commercial planes on the first day of the @entity8 has surprised no one , but at the same time worried just about everyone in the airline industry -- well , everyone who 's not working for the @entity14 airlines			1
the sheer number of aircraft being purchased at this year 's show is outstanding , amazing and a little bit disconcerting			1
the headline deal is @entity20 's eye - popping , jaw - dropping deals for 150 @entity23 airliners and 50 @entity24 , which comes at a time when other airlines are shunning the superjumbo			1
@entity24 risked ending the year without any @entity29 sales until the @entity4 ' order arrived			0
the industry wondered whether @entity24 was going to slow down the @entity29 production line because of a lack of orders , as @entity23 has done with its 747 - 800 assembly line			0
emirates saved the day -- which , i confidently predict , means @entity4 boss @entity38 got a very good price for his new planes , way below the $ 403.9 million list price			2
with this order @entity4 is the @entity29 fleet , owning more than 50 % of all orders of the airliner			0
then there 's the sheer number of @entity23 planes being ordered			0
of the 259 planes announced at the @entity0 launch of @entity23 's revamped long haul aircraft , @entity4 , @entity5 & @entity6 bought 225 of them ! poor @entity54 's @entity53 snapped up 34 to be a launch customer , but no one is in any doubt : it will be the " @entity58 " who will be back in the years ahead to take more by the dozen			1
it sends a very strong message			1
the @entity58 's position as global carriers is established and will only grow stronger			1
emirates are already the largest airline in the world , after the @entity68 carriers , as defined by @entity69 ( the number of paying passengers multiplied by the number of kilometers flown			0
) all those wide - bodied planes with lots of seats mean they have the capacity to shift large numbers of people			0
the @entity68 carriers only maintain the top spots in the rankings because of their big domestic route network -- but internationally @entity4 are number one and widening the gap over the competition			0
take @entity85 , where @entity4 sends 2 @entity86 and a 777 every day to connect to their @entity0 headquarters -- and there are plans to upgrade to 3 @entity86 as soon as possible			1
so why is this worrying ? capacity ! all these big planes have to be filled and there is a saying in the industry -- old planes never die , they just go into someone else 's fleet			1
many of the planes being ordered today in @entity0 will replace aging planes in existing fleets			1
those older aircraft wo n't be scrapped ; they will be sold to secondary airlines at a cheaper price , and those airlines will often slash fares to fill the seats			1
capacity is the biggest killer of the industry in a downturn			0
it happened in 2001 where slowing demand turned the overcapacity into a crisis after the 9/11 terror attacks in @entity85			0
it happened again during the financial crises of 2008			0
airlines found themselves with too many seats and too few passengers and had to mothball planes and slim down			0
for the moment , the industry is enjoying growth of around 5 % a year -- and with new markets emerging , the strong growth in aviation is continuing in front of our eyes			1
the worry is what happens when that slows and who gets hurt			0
i guarantee you it wo n't be the @entity58			1
forget arguments about subsidies , unfair competition , state - controlled airlines : today 's orders in @entity0 are further evidence that the shift in aviation is happening even faster than most had believed likely			1
there may be much fuss made over the soon to - be - merged @entity151 & @entity152 and the fight in the brutal skies of the @entity68 domestic market , but globally , the @entity58 are hoovering up the passengers			2
none of these points will worry the @entity58			2
capacity issues are someone else 's problem for the time being			0
they are sitting pretty in the sweet spot of the new - world order in aviation			0
they have billion dollar brand - new airport hubs , sit at the crossroads of the world 's growing markets and are able to connect any two points on the globe using the dozens of wide - bodied long - haul jets they have just bought			2
most important of all , the @entity58 have their own individual strategies for growth			2
it 's everyone else that 's worried , and they should be .			2

@entity14 airlines strike more than $ 150 billion in commercial plane deals in @entity0
@entity2 's @entity186 : huge deals by " @entity58 " send strong message to rivals
big deals in @entity0 show that power shift in aviation to @entity14 airlines happening fast
