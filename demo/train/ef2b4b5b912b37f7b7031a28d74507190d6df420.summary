-- @entity1 is preparing to conquer a new dimension : the stratosphere			2
the internet giant is releasing 30 high - tech balloons in a trial of technology designed to bring the internet to places where people are not yet connected			1
the balloons are being sent up into the sky from @entity14 's @entity13 this month in the first trial of a pioneering system dubbed @entity17			1
according to @entity1 , " @entity17 is a network of balloons traveling on the edge of space , designed to connect people in rural and remote areas , help fill coverage gaps , and bring people back online after disasters			1
" @entity1 estimates that two - thirds of the global population is without fast , affordable internet access			2
so while it sounds like something from the realms of science fiction , if successful , the project could make a difference to many people around the world			0

@entity14 prime minister @entity45 was in @entity40 on saturday to help unveil the project , according to local media reports			0
residents have also been invited to a special event at the local air force museum sunday to find out more			0
images of a test balloon launch on @entity53 show one floating , eerie and translucent , above snow - capped mountains			0
once released , the balloons will float in the stratosphere above 60,000 feet ( 18,300 meters ) , twice as high as airplanes and the weather , @entity1 says			1
their altitude will be controlled from " @entity61 " using special software to allow them to pick up layers of wind traveling in the right direction and form a balloon network			1
if all goes to plan , about 60 people who 've had a special antenna fixed on their homes for the trial should be able to connect to the balloon network			1
the signal will bounce from balloon to balloon , then to the internet back on @entity77			0
hundreds of people will be able to connect to one balloon at a time			0

they are designed to maintain a constant volume and be longer - lasting than weather balloons			0
the balloons are equipped with antennas with specialized radio frequency technology , @entity1 says , and each one can provide connectivity to a ground area about 25 miles ( 40 kilometers ) in diameter at speeds comparable to @entity95			1
they also carry instruments to monitor weather conditions and allow them to be tracked by gps , powered by solar panels that will store excess energy for nighttime operation			2
each has a parachute in case they need to be brought down			0
it will be very difficult to see the balloons with the naked eye , except during launch , @entity1 says			2
in any case , it may be a while before would - be @entity76 users elsewhere start connecting via balloon			0
according to the @entity17 website , the technology is still being tested to see if it 's viable and what problems would have to be overcome to make it more widely available .			0

the balloons are designed to bring the internet to remote places , @entity1 says
30 balloons are being released in @entity14 for a trial of the technology
the superpressure balloons carry radio *transmitters* and gps , use solar power
homes fitted with a special antenna should be able to connect to the balloon network
