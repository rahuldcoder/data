@entity0 -- @entity3 authorities are investigating after various female journalists got bomb threats via @entity6 amid escalating calls for action to prevent abuse against women on social media			1

a @entity20 spokesman said thursday the force had " received a number of allegations relating to threats sent to a number of female journalists on @entity6 and inquiries are being made			2

it will go off at 10:47			0
" " we 've gone from rape to bomb threats , i see , " she said			1
another tweet by @entity31 said , " thanks all for your concern			0
the police have been round and are now investigating this ' arrestable offense			0
' " @entity31 had written a column tuesday titled " how to use the internet without being a total loser , " which looked at online misogyny , abuse and freedom of speech issues			2
another columnist , @entity56 who writes for @entity57 and others , received the same bomb threat via @entity6			2
she shared a screen grab of the message , saying " well , this is a new low			0
" other women to be sent it include @entity67 's @entity66 editor , @entity65 , who described it on @entity6 as a " not very credible - sounding bomb threat addressed to me			1
" women 's editor @entity69 of @entity72 newspaper said she had also received the threat but , rather than report it , had headed to the pub to meet a contact as planned			1
explaining her reaction , she said it was in part due to having had " years of abuse on @entity6 and in the comment box beneath my @entity72 articles , " and in part a lack of faith in the ability of the police to do anything about it			2
the account from which the bomb threats were sent has been suspended			1
arrests after onslaught of rape threats @entity13 , a freelance journalist as well as a feminist campaigner , attracted the attention of @entity97 " trolls " by petitioning to have women displayed on @entity3 banknotes			1

@entity13 contacted police after a daylong onslaught in which she received around 50 sexually abusive tweets an hour			0
the feminist champion , whose campaign resulted in the @entity107 agreeing to picture " @entity109 " author @entity108 on every 10 - pound bill , tweeted throughout the abuse : " i actually ca n't keep up with the screen - capping & reporting -- rape threats thick and fast now			1
if anyone wants to report the tweets to @entity6			2
" @entity6 @entity3 's general manager @entity117 said the social networking company takes online abuse very seriously , offering to suspend accounts , and called on people to report any " violation of @entity6 rules			1

" a 25 - year - old man was arrested in northeastern @entity135 on tuesday on suspicion of harassment , the @entity20 said , in connection with " allegations made to police by two separate victims , who made reports of malicious communication to police on 25 and 29 july			0
" an online petition set up on @entity145 calling for @entity6 to add a " report abuse " button to tweets has garnered more than 110,000 signatures			1

backlash over rape - threat tweets widespread ' women - hating ' @entity158 , chief executive of the @entity0 - based @entity159 , a national umbrella group for women 's charities , said the online abuse directed against women is " extremely concerning			1
" " you have to ask the question , where does this come from ... and why do some people think it 's acceptable to do that ? " she said			0
@entity158 suggests that the way that women 's worth is commonly assessed in the media by their " physicalness , sexuality and availability to men " is sending the wrong message to men and women			2
the @entity6 threats are " one of the more serious manifestations of what appears an unacceptable level of women - hating , " she said , adding that it points to a society - wide issue that is fairly deep - rooted			1
education is key to changing attitudes and making clear that the denigration of women and violence against them are unacceptable , she said			0
