-- last year , the bus in which a young @entity3 woman we met named @entity5 was riding was stopped by a militia			2
" they wanted to all have me , to rape me , " she related haltingly to us			0
" i told them no , and then they took off my shirt and beat me			0
i have terrible marks now			0
" @entity5 's story is similar to hundreds of thousands of women 's experiences in the eastern @entity3 , where rape is routinely " deployed " as a weapon of war by the armed groups fighting over a nation that has some of the richest nonpetroleum natural resource deposits in the world			1
@entity3 holds the numbing distinction of being home to the deadliest war in the world since @entity26 -- with more than 5.4 million people killed during the past 15 years			2
" this war is caused by the minerals , " @entity5 told us			2
" those [ armed groups ] control the minerals			0
i hear that they are used in mobile phones			0
... if you talk to @entity36 or the phone companies , tell them what happens here			1
" armed groups in eastern @entity3 that control minerals , mines and trading routes generate an estimated $ 180 million each year by trading four main minerals : tin , tantalum , tungsten , and gold			2
this money enables the armed groups to purchase large numbers of weapons and continue their campaign of brutal violence against civilians			0
conflict minerals are key components in the manufacture of cell phones , laptops , digital cameras , video games and portable music players			1
because of increasing awareness of the links between electronics products and the worst sexual violence in the world , change is afoot			0
during @entity73 secretary of state @entity72 's visit to eastern @entity3 in august , she said : " with respect to companies that are responsible for what are now being called conflict minerals , i think the international community must start looking at steps we can take to try to prevent the mineral wealth from the @entity3 ending up in the hands of those who fund the violence here			1
" the @entity84 has also initiated a strong bipartisan effort to curb the conflict minerals trade			1
@entity88 and @entity89 bills on this issue represent a significant step toward having conflict - free cell phones and laptops by setting up a system of audits and minerals - tracing mechanisms			1
this would reveal which phones and laptops contain conflict minerals and which ones do not			1
introduced by sens. @entity104 ( @entity105 ) , @entity106 ( @entity107 ) and @entity108 ( @entity109 ) on the @entity88 side , and @entity111			0
@entity119 ( @entity120 ) , @entity114 ( @entity115 ) , @entity116 ( @entity117 ) and @entity118 ( @entity113 ) on the @entity89 side , the bills already have the support of powerful committee chairmen but still must be moved through committee			0
with the @entity36 administration and @entity84 taking a strong interest in this issue , and activist campaigning building some momentum , companies have begun to react			1
the tin industry has gone the furthest by introducing an initiative to increase due diligence and trace minerals on the ground in @entity3			2
electronics companies also have a project under way to map out supply chains			0
and @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , and @entity143 are hosting a meeting with activists on conflict minerals in @entity147 , @entity148 , this month			1
but it is not enough			0
campus activists -- from @entity151 ; to @entity152 , @entity153 ; to @entity154 -- are taking up this issue with increased vigor , along with major faith - based groups , from the @entity158 to @entity159			0
are the government and company actions taken to date enough to stop the conflict minerals trade from continuing ? the answer is no. electronics companies must invest in a system to certify that the minerals used in their products are verifiably conflict - free			1
they must work with their suppliers to trace the minerals back to their mines of origin and have independent audits conducted of these supply chains so that we know with verified proof that none has passed through the hands of armed groups			0
the @entity36 administration should help companies develop a certification process for conflict minerals , built on the lessons of the @entity187 for blood diamonds			1
the administration can also help devise a public - private partnership to work with companies , the @entity3 government and other key donor countries to help miners in eastern @entity3 and improve mining inspection and tracing on the ground			2
companies and the government can take steps today			0
for a start , electronics companies should have audits conducted of their supply chains for the minerals			2
and @entity84 should pass the conflict minerals legislation , to get tracing started			1
if you have a cell phone , you can also have an impact			0
ask your senator and representative to sign the @entity212 ( @entity213 891 ) and @entity214 ( @entity215 4128 ) , and find a creative way to reach your cell phone manufacturer to tell it you want a conflict - free cell phone			1
the minerals supply chain involves multiple companies , and the war in @entity3 will not be resolved overnight			1
but if companies and consumers take a stand and say " give us conflict - free products , " we can stop this deadly trade and put real pressure on the armed groups that rape women on a mass scale in eastern @entity3			1
let @entity5 's request not be forgotten			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity235 and @entity236 .			2

@entity235 , @entity236 : @entity3 " conflict minerals " fund deadly war in which rape is routine
authors : gunmen sell minerals used in cell phones , laptops , games to buy weapons
*victim* : " if you talk to @entity36 or the phone companies , tell them what happens here "
they say electronics firms must certify minerals are conflict - free , @entity84 must pass bills
