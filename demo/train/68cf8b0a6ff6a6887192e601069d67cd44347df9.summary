-- there is a phrase that has long been used in discussing nuclear warfare : @entity4 assured destruction			1
what it means is that if various enemies develop and use the most powerful and harmful weapons available , everyone will lose			0
national politics is not literal warfare , although its practitioners like to use the language of combat : war rooms			2
attack ads. and as the political world shifts its focus from one national convention to the other , a sentiment has been building that this year 's presidential campaign may turn out to be the dirtiest ever			1
you 've already seen it in the wall - to - wall television commercials during the primary season ; with the fall campaign shifting into overdrive , you can expect the tone of the advertising to make sewage seem pristine by comparison			2
as @entity39 wrote in @entity40 : " with all the pac money floating around , we 've entered the @entity37 of mudslinging			0
" it 's not that the candidates are incapable of high - mindedness ; they are extraordinarily bright			1
but in recent years the mantra of high - octane campaigns has been that below - the - belt tactics work , and the rationalization has been that a candidate ca n't accomplish anything worthy if he or she does n't get elected in the first place			1
@entity57 , in the @entity56 , under the headline " the @entity53 and the @entity54 for president , " wrote last month : " the thinking was that the two presidential candidates , both with @entity60 degrees , would finally use their intellectual prowess to discuss the nation 's challenges seriously			1
" that , he wrote , is looking like an unrealistic expectation , and thus " strategists on both sides are pondering which campaign is best served by the vitriol			0
" from time to time there are public calls for a truce in the invective			0
it never seems to stick			0
@entity77 , writing in @entity40 : " neither side shows any signs of curtailing the negativity			0
... one effect of such early negativity is that both candidates figure to be battered by november , and voters could become fatigued earlier			2
" why does this matter ? with politics more of a spectator sport than ever , what is the real harm in its devolving into an only slightly more refined version of mud wrestling ? the harm is that it 's a difficult shift to go from mud wrestler to statesman once the votes are counted			2
the metaphorical eye - gouging and groin - kicking of take - no - prisoners campaigns may be effective in grabbing voters ' attention -- increasingly , watching a presidential campaign play out is like slowing down to gape at a particularly ugly auto accident			1
but there are indications that the voters are getting wise to the game , and becoming disillusioned with it			0
in a front - page story in @entity108 before the conventions began , @entity106 reported that a @entity108 / @entity115 " finds @entity110 taking a decidedly more negative view of the presidential candidates and the tenor of their campaigns than they did four years ago			1
" some of the findings of the poll : voters are critical of both candidates for making unfair attacks on each other			1
to an extent not seen in at least the last six election seasons , voters say that they view both the @entity126 and @entity127 parties unfavorably			2
when , in 2008 , potential voters were asked if both candidates would make good presidents , 25 % said yes			2
this year , asked the same question , only 12 % said yes			0
and that is the danger of mutual assured destruction , politics - style			1
in warfare , the hoped - for impact of the knowledge that either side could annihilate the other was to preserve a state of peace , however strained or uneasy -- it was , and is , a doctrine of deterrence			1
in politics , it does n't seem to inhibit the combatants			0
a willingness to use any means to win an election will inevitably , in the end , produce a president			2
but then the president will have to lead a nation that has turned darkly cynical about the entire process			0
there is a publication that has none of the glitz or dinner - party cachet of the national newspapers or television news networks , but it reaches an audience that dwarfs theirs			2
the publication is the @entity166 -- circulation 22 million -- and its editor , @entity168 , recently wrote an editorial that puts all of this in measured perspective			0
under the headline " leaders , try greatness , @entity189 , " @entity168 said that strategists for the opposing sides are displaying " no interest in compromise , " and quoted @entity177 president @entity176 in characterizing the current process as " a disgraceful stew of invective ... a continuing contest in which each side of the partisan divide sees itself as right and the other as evil , uncaring or , worst of all , unpatriotic			0
" does it have to be this way ? the editorial recalls @entity194 , who " could just as easily have been talking about today when he wrote in 1776 of his fears that the @entity198 ' decisions would be dictated ' by noise , not sense ; by meanness , not greatness ; by ignorance , not learning ; by contracted hearts , not large souls			0
' " @entity194 wrote , " there must be decency and respect and veneration introduced for persons of authority of every rank or we are undone			1
in popular government , this is our only way			0
' " when the country loses that , it loses something essential			1
just what is it that we are throwing away ? @entity168 's editorial concludes : " decency , respect and veneration produced compromise and a foundation that has endured for 236 years			1
we are surrounded by noise , meanness and ignorance			0
the measure for our leaders must be their ability to rediscover that proven formula of sense , greatness and learning			0
" but what political consultant would waste his client 's money trying to fit those sentiments into a 30 - second commercial ? meanwhile , @entity241 is less than 10 weeks away			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity244 .			1

@entity244 : political campaigns *resemble* warfare 's mutually assured destruction
he says politicians believe the only way to win is by using below - the - belt tactics
a poll showed that @entity110 take an increasingly dim view of negative campaigns , candidates
@entity244 : when the country loses decency , respect , it loses something essential
