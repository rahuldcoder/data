@entity0 -- over the last 15 years , i 've been lucky enough to work in the industry of tech - driven start - ups , and i 've watched as revolutions have taken place			1
technologies we now take for granted -- wifi , the @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 , for example -- have transformed the way we communicate , do business and even facilitate political upheavals			1
yet they remain youthful technologies			2
@entity19 had its earliest start around 1991 , and did n't hit the mainstream until the early 2000s			2
it 's now in every decent coffee shop and threatening to infiltrate the last bastion of un-connectivity -- the @entity27			2
the @entity28 is integral in this narrative of global upheaval			1
but , unlike its @entity33 peers , it 's shy of celebrating its success			1
but without the ground - breaking work of @entity28 companies , this brave new world would not be possible			1
@entity40 , a spin - off of the loved but now - defunct @entity42 , pioneered the high - speed , low - energy brains that power this revolution			2
without @entity40 's " reduced instruction set computing " your laptop would barely last a few hours , and would be too hot to keep on			0
this relatively small company has created such huge opportunity and promise , but the @entity28 barely celebrates them , let alone acknowledge the huge impact they 've had on the future of computing			1
ever heard of @entity57 ? they create bluetooth platforms , a technology which is now emerging as a potential way of securing mobile to mobile transactions , revolutionizing advertising and making sure that you 're still connected to your phone even when driving			0
@entity28 brains are also behind many of the greatest innovations			1
@entity71 invented the world wide web , while @entity73 is the design guru at @entity75			0
and it is these @entity28 visionaries who are as central to our new world , if not more so , than the social platforms that are part of our everyday conversations			1
consumer technology is all very attractive and tangible : @entity9 is immediate ; @entity10 is ubiquitous			1
in contrast , @entity40 , @entity57 and their peers , like @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 , are technical , complex and powerful			0
and hard to make sexy			0
in these times of instant gratification , sexy is a necessary condition			0
however such companies are all products of long - term vision , backed with massive intellectual prowess , creating cutting edge technologies that will remain a core part of the technological future for many , many years			1
this stands them apart from @entity10 and @entity9			1
these things are , by their very nature , faddy , nascent , fast to grow and fast to die			0
@entity106 , @entity107 and countless others became " also - rans " who did n't keep the consumer 's attention beyond a few years			1
so , the @entity28 needs to celebrate its vital role in our new , connected world			1
we 're ambitious , dedicated , passionate , diligent and intellectually capable			0
but we 're also refined , genteel and not one to brag about new riches			0
that attitude stands in stark contrast to our @entity33 peers , who are incredible at creating and monetizing opportunities , then playing to consumers of the digital age -- just as @entity121 did with the silver screen			2
they talk themselves up , they champion their industries , and they invest in each other , both financially and in spirit			0
in short , they are the noisy cousins bragging about their new riches			0
we need to stop being distracted by this hype , and instead invest in and recognize our nation of incredible promise and intellectual capacity			0
we do n't invest enough in academia -- which is why i have established a free school , the @entity138 , to nurture the new generation of entrepreneurs			0
without such investment , we are at risk of failing subsequent generations with an endemic short - termism that does n't set the stage for the next @entity40 , @entity57 , @entity87 or @entity86 to emerge from this green and pleasant land			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity149 .			0

technologies we take for granted such as @entity9 and @entity10 are still young
they 've transformed the way we operate , but social platforms can end up as " has - beens "
@entity28 minds are behind some of the most vital innovations in tech 's brave new world
however , they are complex and we do n't celebrate our success like the @entity33 do
