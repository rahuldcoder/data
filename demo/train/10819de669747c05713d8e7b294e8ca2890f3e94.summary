-- most of those killed on the helicopter that crashed in eastern @entity5 overnight were a part of the fighting force known as the @entity8 , two @entity2 government officials said			1
the men who died were not the ones who killed @entity13 in may , but they belonged to the same unit , a military official said			1
the group has its origins in @entity18 , when the @entity2 realized that to invade @entity19 , it needed savvy , quick - thinking fighters who could perform reconnaissance at sea			0
beyond tactical expertise , the @entity8 -- short for @entity23 , @entity24 and land teams -- needed to have extraordinary physical strength			1
according to the @entity8 web site , they became known as jack - of - all - trade troops , able to survey @entity31 's @entity30 disguised as @entity31 nationals in 1945 or conduct demolition raids on railroad tunnels and bridges along the @entity37 coast during the @entity38			1
it was the @entity8 who were sent to kill @entity13 in @entity40 , ending a decade - long manhunt			1
the @entity8 did not get their name until after president @entity43 spoke about his admiration for special forces troops and his hope that the @entity2 military would better enhance its capacity for unconventional warfare , counter guerrilla and clandestine operations			1
there was a new and pressing need for more advanced military techniques during the time			0
among other missions , the @entity8 were deployed to act as advisers and train @entity59 commandos			1
@entity60 was the first @entity2 war to be broadcast widely on television and media , and woven into popular culture for mainstream consumption			0
it solidified the image of the seals as the ultimate tough guy , a reputation burnished by reports of @entity8 ' ability to do face - to - face combat with @entity74 and stories of their work with the @entity77			1
the relationship between @entity2 's spy agency and its elite troops was crucial to gaining real - time intelligence for missions sometimes carried out at the last minute -- perhaps an asset more important now than ever , experts have said			1
the war against @entity86 is just as much about obtaining reliable intelligence as it is winning on the battlefield			0
@entity8 victories have been many			1
during @entity60 , they performed a covert operation called the @entity92 which captured @entity74 sympathizers			0
in the @entity95 , @entity8 teams conducted missions to counter @entity98 mine - laying boats			1
the first military flag officer to set foot in @entity5 after september 11 , 2001 , was a seal in charge of all special operations for @entity103 , according to the @entity8 history page on its web site			1
the site says @entity8 commanded @entity107 which oversaw the @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 at the beginning of @entity112 which carried out more than 75 special reconnaissance and direct action missions , destroyed more than 500,000 pounds of explosives and weapons , identified enemy personnel and conducted operations that searched for terrorists trying to flee the country by sea			1
the largest deployment of seals in the group 's history came during the @entity126 , with @entity8 directing missions that included securing all of the southern oil infrastructures of the @entity129 and the off - shore gas and oil terminals , clearing critical waterways so that aid could flow into the country			1
several high - value terrorist targets were captured by the @entity8 , including @entity136 , the alleged mastermind of the murder and mutilation of four @entity140 guards in @entity141 , @entity142 , in 2004			2
another recent high - profile mission came in 2009 when a seal team rescued the @entity2 captain of the cargo ship @entity147 , which had been hijacked by @entity149 pirates off @entity149 's coast			2
@entity8 snipers were on the deck of a ship and fired simultaneously three times , hitting three pirates who were holding the captain			2
ultimate test seal training is " the ultimate test for a guy , " said @entity161 , a former seal with 10 years of experience carrying out missions in @entity164 , the @entity165 and @entity5			1
it 's social , physical and psychological and tests how well the man can work with others given intense pressure and pain			2
seals train between 18 and 24 months , with the pinnacle of training coming during @entity177 , five days in which trainees are constantly cold , hungry , sleep deprived and wet			2
during @entity180 week , instructors deprive the participants of sleep , then let them hit the rack just long enough for @entity184 to begin , said @entity185 , a former seal who ran the sniper program at the @entity188 and was part of combat missions in @entity142 and @entity5			1
instructors are constantly yelling , " go ahead , quit if you like ! " many do			0
the attrition rate for @entity8 training is about 90 percent , @entity161 and @entity185 said			2
most recruits drop out long before @entity177 because they ca n't take the training , which involves running 15 miles , topped with a 2 - mile open water swim and other intense physical conditioning , @entity185 said			2
" every day is like climbing @entity198 , " @entity161 said			0
" you just keep doing what 's in front of you			2
you do n't look up			2
" training instructors make you feel like " you 're part of an @entity204 tribe , " @entity161 said			0
" there 's a lot of back patting and verbal reinforcement			0
you feel like you 're part of something and you 're doing great things			0
but they definitely let you know when you 're not doing something right			0
" the discipline from seal training was intensely satisfying to @entity217 in his early 20s			0
he had gone to college , and though he was very bright , he was spending more time working out than on his class work			0
four walls and books just were n't his thing			0
despite unimpressive grades , at 23 he got a job working in home mortgages making $ 63,000 a year			0
then one day he read an article about the seals in @entity230			0
" i enlisted in the @entity108 immediately , " @entity161 said			0
" i asked the recruiter , ' what is the fastest track to becoming a seal ? i 'll take that			0
' " though he wo n't discuss specific areas of countries where he 's carried out missions , he said that he normally trained for missions on exact mock - ups of a targeted location .			1

most of those killed in @entity5 helicopter crash were @entity8 , officials say
men killed were not @entity13 's killers but belonged to same unit
seals are not @entity254 *wannabes* , said a former *member*
keeping quiet is a seal code ; they do n't brag about their missions
