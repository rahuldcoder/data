-- the @entity1 may have started out as an idealistic showcase of amateur sporting prowess , but now it 's a very big business			1
in fact , it 's one of the biggest brands in the world , claims a new report			1
the four - yearly sporting spectacular -- rated second in scale behind soccer 's @entity12 -- is worth just over $ 47.5 billion according to valuation specialist @entity14			0
that leaves it behind only @entity18 ( $ 70.6 billion ) and above the corporate world 's next biggest brand , @entity21 ( $ 47.4 billion )			1
these figures , based on the @entity24 's financial statements , put the legacy of @entity26 well above major sponsors such as @entity28 ( $ 38.2 billion ) , @entity29 ( $ 33.2 billion ) and @entity30 ( $ 31.1 billion )			1
the @entity31 -- who believed in the right for everyone to take part -- revived the @entity35 in the late 1800s			0
some 116 years after the first modern olympics took place in @entity39 , the event is apparently now worth 134 times the @entity40 ( $ 354 million )			0
@entity41 : send us your pictures and videos while the @entity49 economy is all but crippled in these difficult economic times , the @entity1 -- originally dedicated to the gods , but now seemingly devoted to the dollar -- is experiencing significant financial growth			1
in the four years since the @entity53 , total revenue has increased 38 % to $ 5.1 billion			0
of that amount , broadcast revenue has boomed by 51 % to $ 3.9 billion ( compared to just $ 1.2 million in 1960 ) with the largest spend by continent in @entity58 ( $ 2.3 billion )			2
these numbers are expected to go up again as the @entity1 cycle moves from @entity61 to @entity62 in 2016 , with @entity14 -- which has yet to rate soccer 's @entity12 or @entity63 -- reporting that revenue will pass the $ 6 billion mark			1
in fact , another report -- by @entity68 -- states that this four - year cycle will be worth $ 8 billion overall , covering @entity71 and @entity73 's @entity72			2
as the @entity24 retains only 10 % of its income to cover operating costs , this represents a healthy profit -- much of which is plowed back into developing sport worldwide			0
" there is no doubt that the @entity83 ' is a formidable revenue generator and has huge value , " says @entity14 chief executive @entity80			0
" it has recently been criticized for heavy - handed brand control , but it should not be forgotten that in the current four - year cycle $ 4.6 billion has been generated for initiatives to develop sport worldwide			2
it is also expected to produce a net benefit to the @entity93 economy of more than $ 25 billion			0
" however , @entity93 sports business expert @entity94 argues that these figures do not show the whole picture -- and he insists that brand value is more complex than mere numbers can portray			1
" while it can not be denied that the @entity24 contributes to the funding and development of sport across the world , many of the costs associated with running the @entity1 are covered by host nations which , in turn , can divert resources away from investment in other sporting projects that might normally be pursued , " @entity94 , of @entity100 's @entity99 , told @entity0			1
" moreover , the @entity35 often inflict economic costs upon countries ( such as increased congestion , increased crime , resource inflation etc. ) that are not accounted for by the financial figures quoted here			2
" the @entity24 has created value for the brand on the back of unprecedented protection ; there can be few corporations across the world that oblige governments to pass legislation aimed at protecting the @entity35 ' interests			1
as such , the @entity24 is afforded competitive and commercial benefits that are essentially unique and highly distinctive			0
" such restrictions mean that the likes of @entity132 's ( valued at $ 22.2 billion ) have an almost free reign in the supply of food on the @entity137 site			0
and sponsorship deals can ensure a hefty return on investment for the corporations who sign @entity1 partnership deals , known as the top program			1
" @entity146 expects to generate an extra $ 500 million in sales from @entity71 , having already generated $ 100 million from @entity73 2010 , " states the @entity14 report			2
" @entity29 , which reportedly paid $ 200 million for @entity144 sponsorship rights covering @entity61 and @entity73 , already believes it has earned back its investment			0
" @entity29 uses its @entity1 links to win big contracts in the host nations , particularly in developing nations such as @entity155 ( after @entity156 2008 ) and the upcoming @entity72 in @entity157 , @entity158 for 2014			1
" however , @entity94 believes sponsorship is only one factor in measuring brand value			2
" all the sponsorship figure does is to tell us something about the value of the @entity35 brand to a sponsor , rather than to consumers , " he said			2
" this sense of corporatism is further amplified by the geographic figures , which are heavily skewed towards @entity58			0
the implication is that there is little value in the @entity1 brand in @entity176 ( which provides just 1 % of the broadcast revenue )			1
" as well as raising the issue of who the @entity1 actually benefits , @entity94 believes the report gives a limited picture of the @entity35 ' brand value			1
" it highlights the willingness of broadcasters and sponsors to pay for the right to be associated with the @entity35			0
the figures are therefore not necessarily an accurate indicator of true global worth in that there is no clear link to the peoples ' purchase intentions and behavior in relation to the brand , " he said			2
" what the precise nature of that value might be is open to question			0
it is also somewhat worrying that a significant part of the brand value attributed by this study emanates from only two sources : broadcasting and sponsorship			0
" the domination of broadcasting revenues is an especially worrying point as it implies that the majority of brand value is delivered by media spectacle alone			0
" this casts some doubt on the extent to which consumers and fans value the brand , but also implies that the generation of brand value is delivered by broadcasters and sponsors , and not by the @entity24 or the inherent or intrinsic qualities of the products it delivers			0
" @entity94 argues that it is wrong to compare the @entity1 with corporations such as @entity18 and @entity21 , who operate on different timeframes and in a different business environment			1
" the methodology used to value a brand like @entity18 will be entirely different to that employed to value the @entity1 -- it is therefore scientifically unsound to make any such sort of comparison , " he said .			1

report says the @entity1 is the second biggest brand in the world
games lags well behind leader @entity18 but is above @entity21
however , sports business *analyst* says they can not be compared
he argues that brand value is more than just a financial *concept*
