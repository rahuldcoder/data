barely 20 minutes into our 4wd trip and a leopard nonchalantly crosses the sand road some 10 meters ahead of our vehicle			2
any more carefree and it 'd have walked up to the jeep and casually asked for the time of day and a cigarette			2
the leopard is the latest surprise on a surprise - filled long weekend in @entity11			1
the encounter is eyebrow - raising because our guide , @entity15 , has passed @entity16 101 with high honors			2
" there is a good leopard population at @entity20 , " @entity15 said , " but it 's hard to see them as they tend to want to keep away from us			1
" i ca n't promise you 'll see any on this safari			2
" rack one up for the guide			0
rack up another for the leopard			0
the cat 's appearance temporarily silences the far - too - frequent coos from the couple sharing the @entity34 with me			1
they congratulate themselves over every bird we spot in @entity20			1
that 's a lot of congratulating			1
call me fussy , but unless a bird is remarkably colorful or remarkably massive or doing something massively colorful , i fail to get as interested as i probably should			0
lions , tigers , bears -- big stuff , that 's what i want to see			1
even if they 're just lying about scratching themselves			0
biodiversity hotspot one of the biggest surprises of the day is the layout of @entity20			1
located about 300 kilometers southeast of @entity55 , @entity20 is packed with dense scrub , bushes and forest broken up by watering holes and crisscrossed by sand and dirt roads that might render a lot of gps systems useless			1
the park is divided into five blocks ; three of them lack basic infrastructure for visitors and are under development			0
the main block for visitors , @entity71 1 , spans some 20,000 hectares			1
into this area @entity20 packs an impressive list of inhabitants			1
there are no lions or tigers , but there are about 130 bird species ( including six species endemic to @entity11 ) , as well as leopards , elephants , crocodiles , deer , mongoose , macaque monkeys , wild buffalo and the sloth bear			1
other parks in @entity11 , such as the north - central @entity91 , are better known for higher asian elephant populations			1
elephant herds can also be seen at nearby @entity94			0
@entity20 gets its reputation for its leopards , something @entity98 , owner of @entity99 , says is both good and bad			1
" our leopard subspecies is completely unique to @entity11 and marketing of the park is often too heavily focused on the leopard , " he says , echoing the false warning @entity15 had given us			1
" that means some visitors are disappointed if they do n't see one			0
" but the true value of @entity20 is the diversity			1
it is a biodiversity hotspot			0
" eventually i begin reaching for the bird book to study the @entity115 and @entity116 -- even this non-birder can be turned and that 's saying something for the colorful birds here -- but it 's the leopard that wins the day			1
soon after the leopard crosses our path -- on a section of road that resembles the parking lot at the end of a rodeo -- a traffic jam of @entity130 packed with clicking cameras forms			0
time to hand over our prime leopard - watching real estate to other safari goers			0
the beast turns out to be the first of several we spot on the day			0
( for other highlights and more information on the park , see the gallery above			0
) curry for breakfast , lunch and dinner back at the camp on the outskirts of the park , dinner is followed by a well timed gin and tonic that helps wash away the layer of park dust that has attached itself to our faces and throats like a bad souvenir			1
like the safari , @entity11 curry is highly photogenic , though considerably less dusty			1
a @entity11 curry meal is a combination of many curries and dishes , which may or may not consist of plates of things like chicken black curry , prawn curry , lady 's finger curry , dhal , beetroot curry , sambol rice and papadum			1
according to @entity175 chef @entity174 , the options are endless			1
" potato , pumpkin , beetroot , jackfruit , breadfruit , cashew nuts , mukenwela , gotukola , banana blossom , mango , pineapple to name a few , " @entity174 says			0
" of course , never forget dhal , which is always included			0
" in addition , there are various spice combinations			0
chili , curry leaves and cinnamon are the most commonly used , along with coconut milk and freshly grated coconut			1
" there 's generally one protein - based curry of either fish or chicken , and a range of vegetable curries			1
" there 's a combination of wet and dry vegetable curries and a range of vegetables and herbs from potato and pumpkin to the more exotic gotukola and mukunwela			2
" the result of all this is a kaleidoscope of color , a mighty large food coma and dinner clothes that need a vigorous washing afterward			0
@entity220 is eaten at every meal , though the accompaniments vary			0
breakfast features one or two curries , eaten with egg , plain or string hoppers or pittu			0
( see the gallery for images			0
) for the inexperienced , eating three square curries a day is a journey in itself			0
the many variations allows locals to eat curry every day and brand each a different meal -- not unlike @entity237 food in this respect			2
resort break @entity174 's employers run @entity241 in the fishing village of @entity243 on the south edge of the island			2
the resort , 30 luxurious suites -- each with a plunge pool and terrace -- is the beach - side choice for accommodation			0
about 90 minutes from @entity254 ( to the west of @entity243 ) and a similar distance from @entity20 to the east , it 's a perfect location to either stick about or explore the coast			1
connecting all these spots are new smooth roads that make traveling ( either in a rental car or by hiring a driver and car ) and navigating traffic surprisingly easy -- quite a different experience from nearby countries like @entity267 , @entity268 , @entity269 and @entity270			0
the southern edge of the island , between @entity254 and @entity243 , is full of beaches , good surf and at the right season , whale watching			2
( see @entity278 's @entity11 episode for more on whale watching			1
) about a 15 - minute drive inland from the @entity243 shoreline is @entity282 , a 19th - century manor house turned five - suite villa with a large garden that backs onto a rice paddy and is surrounded by forest			0
dinner ( surprise , @entity11 curry ) and a look - see visit are highly recommended			1
surfing @entity11 's southern coast while @entity241 has a private beach ( and serves a private candlelit dinner on its beach ) , nearby @entity293 is more surf friendly			1
with so many other beaches within reach , this bay is rarely crowded -- good news for uncoordinated and curry - induced flabby surfers			2
shallow and with little to no rip , it 's great for beginners who like to stay closer to shore ; advanced surfers paddle further out			2
" @entity11 is a good destination for surfing , with many hidden surfing spots , " says local surfing instructor @entity306			1
" the temperature of the sea is ideal all year and there are no shark or jellyfish threats			0
" diminutive and patient , @entity315 , 40 , began surfing in 1991 and describes himself as the first professional surfer in @entity243			0
" there is only one person who surfed in @entity243 before me and he was my teacher , " he says			0
" now he is too old			0
" @entity315 recommends @entity322 and @entity323 as top surf spots in @entity243			2
further afield he lists @entity325 , @entity326 , @entity327 and @entity328 as must - surf spots			2
like the tourism industry , @entity11 's surf scene is in its relative infancy			1
but with clean beaches , good transport infrastructure and few others to drop in on your wave , the coastline is gaining popularity not only as a surf destination but for its other natural offerings			2
and hey , even its bird life			0
getting there many international air arrivals and departures at @entity55 's @entity346 come between 8 p.m. and 3:30 a.m. sea planes from @entity55 serve @entity243			2
if you 're dealing with an inconvenient arrival time , you may want to spend one or two nights in the @entity254 upon arrival			0
the city 's fort area is well worth a day at least			2
@entity241 's sister hotel , the @entity355 , occupies the historic building that once housed the @entity355 in @entity357			2
the colonial - era building makes for an ideal base for exploring the 17th - century fort			0
@entity355 , 10 church st. , @entity357 , @entity11 ; +94 91 223 3388 ; rooms from $ 500 per night ( rates depend on season )			1

more information on @entity376 is located here ; lessons can be booked directly or via @entity241 and other hotels .			0

leopards are the main draw at @entity20
*traditional* @entity11 dinners have *seemingly* endless curry options
like its tourism industry , @entity11 's surf scene is in its relative infancy
