editor 's note : @entity2 is the author of " the @entity3 : lessons for @entity5 from the people who 've lived the @entity7			1
" he spoke at the @entity9 at the @entity10 in september , 2009			0
his web site is @entity12 / for more @entity13 , click here in the same way organisms select for characteristics that favor the survival and well - being of its species over successive generations , so too do cultures			0
with organisms , we call this process evolution and it represents a sort of accumulated wisdom			0
there is no word for this process in cultures , but there is one for the result			0
and that word is tradition			0
for that past eight years , my team of scientists and @entity39 researchers have explored five parts of the world -- " @entity3 " -- where people live measurably longer lives			1
compared to @entity45 averages , we found a bronze - age culture in @entity48 's interior that produces about 10 times more male centenarians ; a remote peninsula in @entity51 where 50 year - olds have a three-fold better chance or reaching age 90 ; a @entity56 island completely free of @entity59 's ( about 50 percent of @entity45 over age 90 suffer from dementia ) ; and islands in southern @entity63 where people suffer one - sixth the rate of heart disease			1
how do they do it ? the @entity67 established that only about 20 percent of average lifespan ( within certain biological limits ) is dictated by genes			0
lifestyle explains most of the rest of the longevity formula			0
we found that all five @entity3 possessed the same nine lifestyle characteristics			1
among them : a low - meat , plant - based diet ( all of them ate a lot of beans ) and a ritual of " downshifting " each day			0
they experience the same stresses we do -- kids , health , finances -- but they managed it through daily prayer , meditation , ancestor veneration or city - wide happy hours ( like the @entity93 )			0
the secret to longevity , as i see it , has less to do with diet , or even exercise , and more to do with the environment in which a person lives : social and physical			1
what do i mean by this ? they live rewardingly inconvenient lives			1
they walk to the store and to their friends ' homes and they live in houses set up with opportunities to move mindlessly			2
they do their own yard work , hand - knead their own bread dough , and , in the case of @entity116 , get up and down off the floor several dozen times a day			0
they live in strong families that keep them motivated to support loved ones			2
centenarians are still living near their children and feel loved and the expectation to love			0
instead of being mere recipients of care , they are contributors to the lives of their families			2
they grow gardens to contribute vegetables , they continue to cook and clean			0
this has a powerful two-fold effect : children and grandchildren in these families benefit from their grandparents ' wisdom and care while the centenarians feel the motivation to stay active , to get out of bed in the morning , and live for a purpose			1
they live in cities where it is easy to walk to their friends ' houses , to the store or to church			2
so , we figured they get about 105 minutes of physical activity everyday -- and no health club membership ! we know from the @entity158 studies that happiness , smoking and obesity are all " contagious			2
" if your three best friends are obese , there 's a 70 percent better chance that you 'll be overweight			0
people in the @entity3 either proactively surround themselves with people who practice the right behaviors or are born into communities of people who do -- or people whose idea of fun is gardening , or bocce ball or swimming ; people who eat meat sparingly , who have faith , who are trusting and trust - worthy			1
why is this so important ? no supplement , hormone , antioxidant or pill of any sort has been shown to reverse , stop or even slow aging			2
the problem is two-fold : to do the study properly , you 'd need to follow two groups of people for life : one who takes the pill , the other that does n't			1
then you 'd have to control for all other factors and compare the average age of death for each group			0
no such study has ever been done on a " longevity " supplement			0
the second problem is adherence			0
people in general just do n't stick to doing anything for very long			1
are you taking supplements ? how long have you been taking them ? i 'll bet not more than a few years			2
@entity10 ( and hucksters ) have offered us countless diets but research done by the @entity214 's dr. @entity213 has shown that fewer than 2 percent of people adhere to diets for more than two years			1
for anything to really impact your life expectancy positively , you need to do it for most of your life			2
friends , unlike pills or diets , are much more likely to be much longer - term undertakings			1
the secret to solving much of @entity45 's health care crisis and battle with chronic diseases lies in emulating the environment in @entity3			1
is it possible ? last year , my partners and i made @entity3 - inspired changes to the environment of an entire @entity45 town -- @entity234 , @entity214 , ( see @entity236 article )			1
we made the town more walkable and bikeable , dug public gardens , made it easier for kids to walk to school and people to expand their face - to - face social networks to include more people motivated to change their health habits			1
if the trends continue , life expectancy for the average participant would rise about three years and health care costs for city workers would decrease by 48 percent			0
the wisdom of the world 's @entity3 represents centuries or even millennia of observed human experience			1
as @entity257 and @entity258 argue over how to solve the health care crisis , perhaps they should take a moment to consider the wisdom of their grandmothers			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

researchers looked at regions where people live long lives
@entity2 says they found common practices in these " @entity3 " regions
people live longer when they have active physical and social lives , he says
@entity2 : pills , diets are n't as important as having purpose in life
