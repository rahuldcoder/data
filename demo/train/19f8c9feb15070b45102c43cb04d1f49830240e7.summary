it 's easy to write off @entity2 's largest city as just another congested , chaotic @entity4 metropolis			1
as more international travelers discover @entity2 for its biodiversity , where they can explore the @entity8 , the @entity10 basin and the world 's largest salt lake in one visit , @entity5 is their most likely point of entry			1
but to most , it 's little more than that -- a place to spend a day or two sipping coca tea and adjust to life at 10,000 feet while planning adventures			2
the congestion and chaos quickly become apparent as you descend the @entity25 to the " bowl " of the downtown core , a tangled maze of steep and winding streets			2
the cultural legacy of @entity2 's largest indigenous groups , the @entity32 and @entity33 , permeate the busy urban landscape , where vehicles compete with pedestrians and sidewalk vendors			1
with elevations ranging from 9,800 to 13,450 feet , " the city that touches the sky " has plenty of distinctions that come in handy in bar trivia : home of the world 's highest international airport and highest seat of government			1
its elevation also makes for extreme temperature : sunny , hot days and cold , windy nights			0
but a closer look reveals some unexpected surprises that are n't spelled out in tour guides			0
@entity56 flanked by the @entity57 , a noisy thoroughfare and a busy side street , @entity56 is not the prettiest public space @entity5 has to offer , but it 's a great place to people - watch			1
women dressed in traditional indigenous style of bowler hats and poofy petticoats , babies slung over their shoulders in colorful wraps , wait for buses alongside teens in skinny jeans and heavy eye makeup			1
vendors in blue jumpsuits push around carts of ice cream which everyone seems to be eating			0
the @entity56 church is worth a visit in itself			0
its stone - carved facade is in the intricate style of 16 - century baroque and mestizo architecture			0
a tour of the basilica and cloister offers an overview of @entity5 's founding and fight for independence , along with an opportunity to glimpse the city from the bell tower			1
@entity95 the city 's last remaining example of what a street looked like in colonial times could be considered one of the most touristy parts of @entity5 , owing to the polish of its refurbished structures			1
but in a busy metropolis that does n't go out of its way to cater to tourists , it 's a peaceful stretch of cobblestone and colorful buildings that brings to mind other colonial cities like @entity113 , @entity114 , or @entity115 , @entity116			0
step inside one of the dimly - lit bars or restaurants and you 'll find quiet courtyards shielded from the bustle of the city			2
the street is home to four museums in colonial homes , noteworthy for their architecture as much as their exhibits			0
@entity130 -- former home of @entity131 , one of the martyrs of the @entity5 @entity134 movement of july 16 , 1809 -- features paintings , furniture and clothing from an era when @entity5 was torn between loyalty to the @entity141 viceroy and support for indigenous rights			1
at the @entity147 , also a school and meeting place for aspiring musicians , visitors are likely to stumble upon a jam session of charango players or pan flutists			1
students of the school often put on saturday night performances , where you might catch a guitar duet performed by a 7 - year - old prodigy and his @entity158 instructor			2
@entity159 if you 're in @entity2 long enough , chances are you 'll stumble on a parade or celebration where traditional @entity2 song and dance is the centerpiece ( yet another reason to stick around @entity5 on the weekend )			1
the colorful costumes and masks , representative of dances from different regions and evocative of the film , " return to @entity169 , " might leave the uninitiated wondering what the heck is going on			0
the @entity159 offers some explanation for why horned devil masks and caricatures of african slaves figure prominently in folklore in an impressive display of masks and costumes			2
for extra trivia , check out the exhibit on the participation of transvestites in cultural celebrations of the late 20th century			0
most wednesdays , the museum keeps its doors open late for a show by the renowned @entity194 , in which dancers decked out in full garb demonstrate customs from various regions , minus the drunken revelry of the street			0
local markets , witches market , @entity202 and @entity203 most @entity205 tourists will have little use for items at local markets			1
but they 're good for getting a sense of how @entity2 shop and what seems to be popular : puffy corn resembling @entity211 , exotic seeds , reams of multi-colored fabric , shoes and underwear , cell phone chips , kitchen accessories , a shoe shine , keys made by hand			1
those who 've never seen a dried llama or alpaca fetus would do well to check out @entity201 , which also offers charms and herbs that purport to prolong sexual encounters or attract secret crushes			2
vendors down the street on @entity203 down to @entity231 sell the traditional goods that tourists tend to look for in @entity234 -- colorful hats and scarves made of alpaca and llama wool bearing images of alpacas and llamas , colorful rugs and textiles , jewelry with indigenous designs , all cheaper than you 'll find similar items in @entity248 or @entity249			2
street food at the local markets , tucked among the stalls of clothes and housekeeping products , foreigners can eat like a local at the same prices as a local , $ 1 to $ 2 on average			1
eating in the street is not for everyone , especially those with sensitive stomachs , but it 's worth for the risk for those willing to try			0
@entity2 is a meat and potatoes kind of country , with a knack for throwing fried eggs on the side and a few pieces of yucca if you 're lucky			1
women push around carts that double as kitchen counters from which they prepare full course meals , from lechon to empanadas to roasted pork sandwiches			0
at night , more roving carts appear , offering tripe or hamburgers and hot dogs and salchipapas ( sausages and french fries )			0
fresh fruit juice stands are abundant , but should also be approached with caution			0
cups of pear juice with a fuzzy pit resting at the bottom may remind you of the llama fetus at @entity201 , but drink it and you 'll be treated to one of the sweetest drinks without artificial sweetener you 'll ever try			0
do n't forget to suck on the pit when you 're done !			0
