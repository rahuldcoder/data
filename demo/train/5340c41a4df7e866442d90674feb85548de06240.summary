-- with all the @entity2 news lately -- the flat ipo , the regulatory interest , the @entity6 wedding -- it 's highly possibly you 've forgotten all about @entity8			1
if so , you 'd be like most @entity9			1
only 8 % of online @entity9 check their @entity8 feeds on an average day , according to survey results released thursday by the @entity11			1
that 's up from 2 % in november 2010 and 5 % in august , the group says , but it 's nowhere near the numbers @entity15 tallies when it asks about online social networks in general			1
in february , the group asked @entity9 if they " use social networking sites like @entity2 , @entity19 or @entity20			1
" sixty - six percent said yes			0
that 's not an apples - to - apples comparison , since the questions were asked in different ways and since @entity15 did n't ask about just @entity2 specifically			1
but it 's fair to assume the vast majority of those respondents use @entity2 , or @entity2 in combination with some other social networks , said @entity30 , a senior research specialist at @entity15			1
that means @entity2 appears to be reaching a much broader chunk of the population			0
perhaps confusingly , @entity8 continues to make news for other reasons than popularity			2
the service was recently the basis for live question - answer - sessions with the @entity9 president ; it played a role in coordinating protests during the @entity43 ; and a @entity45 man inadvertently alerted the world to last year 's raid that killed @entity48 when he live tweeted it			2
it 's also given consumers , including famous people such as director @entity52 , a way to complain about poor customer service			0
and it can create conversations between wildly different groups of people : witness this exchange between @entity61 rapper @entity60 and the billionaire oil tycoon @entity62			0
a @entity64 writer described the dichotomy -- that @entity8 seems essential to some forms of communication but , apparently , is n't all that mainstream -- in this way : " @entity8 is growing in all sorts of ways : in the number of tweets sent per day , in the ad revenue it 's taking in , in the number of celebrities and brands using it in ways they quickly come to regret			1
but in terms of the overall proportion of the population engaging with the social messaging service , it might be in a bit of a lull			2
" user numbers also tell the story of @entity2 's rise and @entity8 's relative stagnation			2
@entity2 says it has 901 million active users at this point , and the site is widely expected to cross the 1 billion mark this year			0
@entity8 , meanwhile , says it has 140 million monthly active users			1
the site went through meteoric growth in its early years			0
but it 's been six years since @entity8 launched , and by some metrics that growth appears to have slowed			2
unsurprisingly , a @entity8 spokesperson saw things differently			2
" growth is extremely strong			0
we announced that we have more than 140 million active users in march			0
the previous number we shared was 100 million active users just last september , " @entity106 told @entity0 in an e-mail			0
" to add to that , it took us 3 years , 2 months and 1 day to reach 1 billion tweets			0
now , we see more than 1 billion tweets every 3 days			0
" in its survey , conducted in two chunks between january and april , @entity15 found that the percentage of online @entity9 who use @entity8 has leveled off			1
only 15 % of online adults in february said they used @entity8 -- and that 's " similar to " the 13 % who said they used the micro-blogging platform in may 2011 , according to @entity15 's report			1
while the overall popularity of @entity8 may be about the same , the subset of people who use @entity8 frequently appears to be growing , according to the report			2
" the proportion of online adults who use @entity8 on a typical day has doubled since may 2011 and has quadrupled since late 2010 , " @entity15 writes			1
so it would appear that @entity8 does matter quite a lot for some people			2
@entity30 , the @entity15 researcher , said in a phone interview that much of the growth in @entity8 is driven by younger people who use the mobile web or apps to access @entity8 's services			1
it 's part of the trend of " constant access " to data , which " really pulls people more deeply into the ( technological ) tools they use , " he said			0
and maybe that 's the trend to underscore , rather than pitting social networks at each other			0
some tech pundits argue @entity2 and @entity8 serve very different purposes -- with @entity8 becoming more of a news feed and @entity2 becoming an online hub for friendships			0
what do you think ? is @entity8 falling behind ? or , at a time when the network is democratizing the spread of information , at least for some people , does @entity8 still have an important role to play on the @entity161 ? if you 're part of the elite , @entity8 - addicted 8 % , we 'll await your responses on @entity8			1
and if not , @entity165 also has a @entity2 page .			0

@entity15 survey finds 8 % of @entity9 internet users go on @entity8 daily
@entity64 writer says @entity8 " might be in a bit of a lull "
