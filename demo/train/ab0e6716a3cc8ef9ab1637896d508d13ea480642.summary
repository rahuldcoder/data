-- @entity0 lost a much loved and respected colleague monday with the sudden passing of photojournalist @entity3			1
a longtime member of @entity0 's @entity6 bureau , @entity3 had to flee his country in 2006 after death threats , eventually settling in the @entity9 and continuing his work for @entity0 based out of @entity11			1
* * * in the darkest days of war and amid the chaos and despair it wrought , @entity0 staffers in @entity13 could always count on @entity3 to bring some light -- even humor -- to the worst of situations			1
he was unflappable , committed to the job and yet , at the same time , a goofball who could provide endless laughter when it was least expected and most needed			2
and perhaps above all , he had empathy and compassion for those who suffered most from the war			2
his sudden death on monday has rocked his @entity0 family and a loving circle of friends and family , all of whom are trying to process how @entity3 could be taken so soon , and with so much more to conquer			1
from @entity34 to @entity0 after a childhood spent under @entity34 's rule , @entity3 used the dictator 's overthrow as a springboard into a life incredibly well - lived			1
he came to @entity0 early in the war , a young cameraman recommended by his uncle @entity43 , himself a @entity0 staff member in @entity6			1
@entity0 's @entity45 hired him in january 2003 , just before the war began , mentoring a nervous , shy young man who knew not a word of @entity48			1
" he was , in many ways , shell - shocked by life under @entity34 , but was obviously keen to be working for @entity0 , " @entity45 said			1
" in the beginning , we had to try to bring him out of that shell -- something made more difficult because we had to use a translator just to give him the basics of what we needed			0
" when the war started a few months later , he had already picked up some @entity48 and his true personality started shining through and it was n't long before he was out in the field shooting stories for us			0
" @entity3 was our personification of the @entity13 dream : work hard , get out alive , take the ones you love with you if you can , find success in @entity9 and charm people along the way			1
" like so many @entity13 who worked with the @entity71 , @entity3 risked his life doing so			1
eventually , after a very specific death threat , he was forced to leave			2
but he did take one special person with him : his invalid mother , @entity74			0
he brought her to the @entity9 and spent his own money initially to have her cared for in his apartment 24/7			1
he talked endlessly to her , not knowing whether she could hear or understand			0
even when he was away on assignment , he would call or @entity78 and have @entity74 's nurses hold the phone or laptop next to her			2
you should have heard his @entity84 impression @entity3 had a wicked ( and sometimes ribald ) sense of humor			1
his usual greeting to me , an @entity89 , was a full - throated " @entity90 ! ! ! ! " often , in the middle of editing a story , he was inclined to do his @entity84 impersonation : " happening noowwww ! " his other signature phrase was an enthusiastic " @entity96 ! ! ! " which could be used in @entity3 's world for just about any occasion			1
he was a fixture in our @entity6 operation , ever cheerful and brimming with talent , and legendary for his ability to fall asleep just about anywhere , anytime			1
equally legendary was the volume of his snoring ; no one could , or would , share a room with @entity3 during @entity6 assignments			1
within hours of the news of his passing , my @entity111 feed and email in - box were inundated by photographs and recollections , anecdotes and tributes			0
' a bright light ' in a war zone former @entity123 @entity122 put it well : " war zones sharpen edges			0
which makes it all the more remarkable that those of us who met @entity3 in @entity6 remember him as such a bright light			1
" he had many -- so many -- close friends in the @entity0 family			1
correspondent @entity137 described years of working alongside him			0
" from @entity6 to @entity138 , @entity139 to @entity140 , @entity141 to @entity142 , he really made some of the toughest assignments so memorable , " she said			1
" he captured every story so beautifully , his pictures told it so brilliantly			0
@entity0 lost a gift today , but we all lost the man			1
" senior international correspondent @entity150 , who spent much of the war living in @entity6 alongside @entity3 , echoed those thoughts in recalling his work covering the 2012 attack on the @entity9 consulate in @entity156 , @entity157			1
" he was the one who somehow saw and noticed things that we did n't , " @entity158 said			0
" a piece of paper fluttering amid the ashes with ' @entity157 is sooooo important ' scrawled on it			0
the remnants of the last meal in the kitchen			0
a flower that somehow survived the carnage			0
" @entity158 and @entity3 won an @entity170 for their coverage of the attack			2
@entity173 , a regular bureau chief for @entity0 in @entity6 during the war and now chief of @entity0 's @entity177 bureau , recalled going on a police patrol in @entity179 with @entity3 and correspondent @entity180			1
" we were zipping through a dark , windy residential neighborhood when an ied went off , " he said			0
" it felt like a mule kicked me in the chest			0
" @entity173 , in the aftermath of the explosion , could n't hear or see			0
" when my eyes did refocus , the air was so full of sand and dust i could no longer see @entity3 's truck in front of me			1
i was convinced it had been hit			0
" @entity173 jumped from the truck and ran into the road			0
standing there was @entity3 , a camera on his shoulder			2
" we asked each other frantically if the other was hurt			0
then he looked at me and said , ' @entity205 , i am so sorry , ' " @entity173 recalled			0
when asked why , @entity3 replied : " i do n't think i was rolling			2
" " later that night we got back to the safe house , covered with dust and a little blood			0
and we watched the tape			0
... he was rolling , " @entity173 said			0
just weeks from @entity9 citizenship @entity3 worked for many years for @entity0 in @entity13 , but more recently he covered many other stories , both " good news " assignments and conflicts , too			1
correspondent @entity216 remembered a funny moment with @entity3 while covering the uprising in @entity219			2
" i 'm a good foot taller than @entity3 , " she said			2
" so it made a lot of @entity219 laugh to see him dragging a camera case along to stand on when he was filming me			0
" when it kicked off inside @entity227 and we 'd been separated he -- all 5 - foot - nothing of him -- fought his way through to find me			0
we used to joke it was our ' @entity231 ' moment , shouting each other 's names through the crowd			2
we eventually took shelter in the @entity236 overlooking @entity227 , and as the mob swarmed outside the now - barricaded glass doors he calmly ordered combo meals for both of us			0
" another longtime @entity242 bureau chief , @entity241 , described @entity3 's passing as a loss not only for friends and family , but for journalism as well			1
" he will be forever remembered for the infectious sense of humor and smile , but he should be remembered as a journalist 's journalist			2
he was a true professional in every sense of the word , who brought a whole lot of important stories to the world			0
with @entity3 , @entity0 was a better news organization			1
" @entity3 was taken far too soon			2
his @entity9 dream was still unfolding and he had so much more to give , as a professional and a man			2
@entity3 was to become an @entity9 citizen in the next few weeks , something he had been waiting for for so long			1

@entity3 died suddenly monday at age 42
an @entity13 native , he was a longtime member of @entity0 's @entity6 bureau
he fled the country in 2006 after getting death threats
he was just weeks away from @entity9 citizenship
