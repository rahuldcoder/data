@entity0 -- the @entity2 released a tough ad friday that links the @entity5 challenger in a competitive @entity7 race in @entity8 to a convicted serial killer			1
the ad , which comes weeks before voters will decide the fate of incumbent rep. @entity12 , slams democrat @entity13 for supporting a " good time " law that released convicted robber @entity15 from prison after he served half his sentence			1
@entity15 killed four people shortly after his release , a case that was highly publicized in @entity8			1
the tv spot opens with a news clip of a shackled @entity15 angrily shouting in the direction of news cameras before a picture of @entity15 ' heavily tattooed face next to a shotgun appears on screen			0
responding to the ad @entity13 's campaign manager , @entity30 , said , " it 's clear that congressman @entity12 is fearing for his political life and will say and do anything to keep his $ 174,000 salary			1
" the @entity7 @entity5 campaign arm immediately condemned the spot and called on the @entity38 to apologize and pull the ad , which is expected to run for the next week , from the airwaves			2
" this repellent , race - baiting ad has no place in @entity45 , " @entity41 spokeswoman @entity40 said			0
" republicans should be ashamed that they have resorted to divisive rhetoric , playing up racial stereotypes and fear - mongering to save their sinking candidate			0
" @entity15 is black , and the ad drew immediate comparisons to the 1988 @entity53 attack ad , which overtly tied @entity5 presidential nominee @entity54 to the crimes convicted murderer @entity53 committed while on weekend furlough under @entity54 ' governorship			0
the ad was believed to be wildly effective in compounding claims that @entity54 was soft on crime , but has since been widely repudiated by both the left and right			0
@entity46 do n't appear ready to condemn this ad , and @entity38 spokesman @entity62 said the committee has no plans to cancel the ad buy			0
" @entity13 's record on crime is fair game , " @entity62 said , noting that @entity13 still defends the law			1
" @entity8 voters deserve to know that @entity13 supports policies that have made them less safe			1
" @entity12 campaign manager @entity72 attempted to slightly distance the campaign from the ad , but would not condemn it			2
" there 's no denying the ad is factual			2
however , our campaign has made it a point in our advertising not to invoke the names of specific criminals or victims , " @entity72 said			0
" still , the ad reflects the issues of this campaign , one of which is why does @entity13 still support the good time law ? " the @entity38 expects to spend about $ 1 million in the contentious @entity8 race			1
about $ 170,000 will keep this ad on air for a week .			0
