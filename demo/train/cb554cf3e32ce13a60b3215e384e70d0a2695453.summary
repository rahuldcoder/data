-- the @entity1 relinquished his crown yesterday			1
so did the country 's football dynasty			1
goals were scored aplenty , and one mighty underdog lifted its nation 's spirits even in loss			2
here 's what we 'll be talking about and looking forward to today at the @entity12 : 1			2
@entity13 vs. uruguay third time 's the charm : second guessing is second nature for fans , but @entity19 's taken it to a whole another level			1
we swear they 're overly obsessed over @entity25			1
( somewhere @entity29 is going , " @entity25 , i know			1
boy , do i know			2
" ) we 're talking about a guy who 's scored 39 goals for his country , but not a single one at a @entity12			2
and this is his third one			2
@entity32 should fare better than it did in its 1 - 3 loss to @entity34			2
its star forward , @entity35 , recovering from knee surgery , is ready to play			2
it 's not just that he can score -- and do so spectacularly -- it 's the confidence that his presence will infuse in the team			1
other @entity40 lord of the dance : it sure would be nice to see @entity44 score against the @entity45 -- just to enjoy another one of its goal celebrations			1
imagine how the players would dance if they won this match and virtually assured their passage into the next round ? clean sweep : in the last match of the day , @entity53 plays @entity55			1
@entity53 , while far from dazzling , played much better in its opener than the final score reflected ( a 3 - 0 loss to @entity44 )			1
@entity55 , too , was pretty good against the @entity45 until the @entity59 nabbed two late goals			1
fans of the @entity55 clean up after themselves in the stands			1
here 's hoping the team does so too on the field			1
@entity66 's @entity65 spanish inquisition : there 's going to be an anguished inquest in @entity66 today			2
its players came into the tournament singing " @entity73			0
" they leave red - faced , losing not just to the @entity74 1 - 5 last week , but also to @entity75 0 - 2			0
they lost to @entity75 -- a team that 's never beaten them , ever ! here 's how hard the rain fell on @entity66			1
in 2010 , it conceded only two goals the entire tournament			0
in just two games this year , it swallowed seven ! @entity75 , on the other hand , was still singing up a storm in @entity87 early this morning			0
its team was a joy to watch : cohesive , clever , confident			0
the @entity90 call and response : it was the soccer equivalent of that musical form			0
one team scored ; the other equalized mere minutes later			0
and although @entity98 was the huge underdog to the @entity101 behemoth yesterday , this was no @entity74 rout			0
the @entity74 move on to the round of 16 after beating the @entity103 3 - 2			0
but what we 'll remember is the @entity98 ' never - say - die fight -- and @entity108 's thunderstruck volley			1
@entity110 tear down this wall : at first , it seemed kind of humorous : ticketless fans marauding through a tunnel underneath the stadium looking for their dream destination -- seats at the @entity12			1
then it turned into something like the running of the bulls			0
the fans knocked down temporary walls as they herded down the corridor , swarming past stunned journalists inside the maracana stadium an hour before the @entity75 - @entity66 kickoff yesterday			0
cops detained at least 85			0
just for kicks while you wait for the games to begin , here is some soccer - related stuff that 's making waves this thursday : if not ronaldo , then @entity137 ? : the @entity138 is loose and ready to produce rhymes in times that strike and score , that you 'll adore , that take their toll , until he reaches his goooooooooooooooal			1
sorry , we 'll leave the rapping to @entity148 , aka @entity138 ( his preferred uniform number ) , who according to @entity150 will release a new album after the @entity12			0
it 's not his first rap effort , as fans of the 2006 @entity157 team will recall			0
and we shall call it golfball : a game that combines the two			0
why not ? soccer in a minion nutshell : also known as haters gon na hate			0

@entity19 is hoping for a win -- and for @entity25 to score
@entity44 takes on the @entity45
@entity55 is *deceptively* good
