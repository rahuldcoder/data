here 's a roundup of five medical studies published this week that might give you new insights into your health			2
remember , correlation is not causation -- so if a study finds a connection between two things , it does n't mean that one causes the other			1
dream on and it 'll get weird at the beginning of your sleep cycle , you may be dreaming about grocery shopping or your favorite tv show			2
but by the end of the night , you more likely will be dreaming about doing that shopping in your underwear with a murderous clown following you			2
in a study in the @entity27 journal , scientists followed the dream patterns of 16 people over two nights			2
the dreamers were awakened four times a night and asked to describe their dreams			2
the researchers found the longer someone slept the stranger and more emotional and in - depth their dreams got			2
scientists concluded that a particular time of night may affect the content of dreams			0
a new way to detect depression currently , a doctor or social worker will ask you a standard set of questions to determine if you are depressed			0
@entity48 is often underdiagnosed because studies have shown patients frequently underreport their symptoms			0
scientists at @entity53 have come up with an alternative way to diagnose depression that uses a blood test , according to a study from @entity58			0
the blood test looks at nine genetic markers in the blood that have been linked to depression			0
scientists tried the test on 32 adults who were diagnosed as depressed and 32 who were not			0
after 18 weeks of therapy , those who were considered depressed were tested again			0
those who improved through therapy showed a change in their genetic markers			0
the accuracy of the blood test showed similar results to people who were diagnosed through diagnostic interviews			0
could a blood test predict suicides ? @entity80 beer bellies are getting bigger @entity80 are getting bigger around the middle , according to a study in the @entity83			1
that 's considered the most dangerous place on the body to gain weight			0
studies have shown that people whose weight settles in their midsections have a higher risk for diabetes , heart disease and other serious conditions			1
in this study , the @entity96 looked at adults over a period of 12 years			0
they found that the average waist size went up nearly an inch for men , to almost 40 inches			1
for women , the average waistline was about 38 inches , which is up nearly an inch and a half from 2000			1
by the @entity96 's estimates , 54 % of @entity80 adults are heavier in their midsections			1
that 's up from 46 % in 1999 - 2000			0
the average body mass index , or @entity111 , has stayed steady			1
illicit drug use among teens is down slightly fewer teens are using illicit drugs and binge drinking , according to the @entity117 on @entity118 and @entity119 , which was released in full this week			1
about 8.8 % of teens 12 to 17 reported using illegal drugs in the survey , a decrease of 13 % from 2009 and 24 % from 2002			1
fewer teens also reported drinking in the month before completing the survey			1
around 6.2 % reported binge drinking			0
even marijuana use among teens was down slightly			2
researchers did not see a change in the number of people over 12 who were using pain relievers for nonmedical purposes			0
around 4.5 million @entity80 admitted to doing so , a rate similar to those in 2011 and 2012			1
@entity135 : how we created the heroin problem a link between artificial sweeteners and diabetes artificial sweeteners may be messing with our gut bacteria and , in turn , with our ability to tolerate glucose			1
glucose intolerance is a condition that can lead to diabetes			1
the series of studies appeared this week in the journal @entity151			0
scientists found that when mice ate or drank liquid or food made from aspartame , saccharin or sucralose , many of them became glucose intolerant			1
researchers then tested the same thing out in seven human volunteers			0
four of the seven developed glucose intolerance after consuming a regular dose of saccharin for a week			1
these individuals were not regular users of artificial sweeteners before the experiment			1
in a separate study of 400 humans , the scientists noticed the gut bacteria in study participants changed after they consumed artificial sweeteners			1
gut bacteria are different in everyone			0
but some experts believe our gut bacteria can affect how our body processes food and burns calories			0
they theorize that the way sweeteners react with gut bacteria may affect whether someone gains or loses weight .			2

average @entity111 has stayed the same for @entity80 , but our waist size is *expanding*
consuming artificial sweeteners make some mice glucose intolerant , leading to diabetes
teens are doing fewer illicit drugs , a national survey finds
