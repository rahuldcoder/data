@entity0 -- promises are an inherent part of campaigning			2
but in a time where distrust of government is at an all - time high , 2012 @entity10 candidates are using promises of action on day 1 of their administrations to convince voters of the seriousness of the problems facing the nation and their seriousness about taking immediate action to fix them			1
for the most part , the campaigns have focused on using executive orders as a means to do something on the first day			1
former house speaker @entity26 outlines on his website the content of the executive order he would sign in his first day in office			2
he promises to eliminate all @entity32 " czar " positions , reauthorize a policy to stop " taxpayer dollars from being used to fund or promote abortions in foreign countries " and to move the @entity39 embassy in @entity40 from @entity41 to @entity42 , among other things			1
@entity44 says all of these would be done using executive orders -- and promises they will all be online by october			1
former @entity49 gov. @entity48 has also been specific with what he would do through executive orders , laying out a plan for five of them to be signed on his first day in the @entity32			1
@entity48 pledges to " return maximum possibly authority to states , " in regard to health care and " immediately initiate the elimination of @entity61 - era regulations that unduly burden the economy			1
" additionally , @entity48 has said he would use an executive order to direct the @entity64 to increase the number of drilling permits issued in the @entity39			1
there is a certain level of vagueness , however , from both @entity44 and @entity48 about their plans			1
in january , @entity44 promised a crowd in @entity73 to " repeal every @entity61 attack on religion			1
" additionally , @entity48 does not say how he will return power to the states or what level of scrutiny these new drilling permits will receive			2
" these types of promises can be very specific , " said @entity81 , @entity1 senior legal analyst			0
" this is a good thing if you believe the politicians should make accountable promises			0
" first - day use of executive orders has become the norm in modern politics			1
" most presidents have a list of executive orders that they want to have ready for signature on the first day of office , " @entity81 said			1
on january 21 , 2009 , president @entity61 issued two executive orders and three presidential memorandums aimed at government transparency and ethics			1
in his first full day in office the new president froze the salaries of his senior aides , demanded the government disclose more information and authorized new limits on lobbyists ' access to lawmakers			0
@entity112 congressman @entity111 has said in interviews that the country 's problems are currently too large to be fixed in one day , but he has said he would start with foreign policy and " bring the troops home , " so they can spend their money here			2
former sen. @entity120 of @entity121 said in july that his first action as president would be to " sign an executive order to repeal @entity125			0
" additionally , @entity120 has outlined executive orders to reverse regulations on business and reinstitute the @entity129 to stop taxpayer funding or promotion of abortions overseas			1
for all candidates , it is important to note that an executive order can not overrule a law passed by the @entity137 and @entity32 and signed by a former president			1
therefore , though a candidate may want to abolish the @entity125 with the stroke of a pen , it would take a full - fledged bill to do that			0
and that stipulation has not been overlooked by some campaigns			0
" i will ask members of @entity149 to stay in session			0
on january 3rd , i will ask them first repeal @entity125 , " @entity44 said at a @entity152 event in january			2
" i will also ask them to stay in session and repeal the @entity157 bill , which is killing banks			0
third â € ” i will ask them to repeal the @entity161 bill , " which was enacted in the wake of the @entity163 , @entity164 and other corporate scandals			0
in conjunction with his first day executive orders , @entity44 says that by the time @entity61 " arrives back in @entity170 , " the @entity44 administration would have dismantled 40 % of @entity61 's government			1
not to be outdone , @entity48 has pledged , via congressional bill , to reduce the corporate income tax by 25 % and would cut non-security discretionary spending by 5 %			2
additionally he would " consolidate the sprawl of federal retraining programs and return funding and responsibility for these programs to the states			0
" all of these promises begs the question -- is there even enough time on day 1 to get this much done ? in short , yes , says @entity186 , former adviser to president @entity187 and chief of staff to first lady @entity189			1
but @entity186 cautioned about how busy @entity190 can be			0
it takes an effective transition team to make consequential first day orders a reality , said @entity186			2
@entity186 , who helped with multiple transitions while working for three presidents , says the day starts with an early morning briefing on national security that lays out the responsibilities that fall on the then president - elect once he is sworn in			2
following that , the president - elect has coffee with the sitting president			0
then there are the more notable events -- the inauguration speech , lunch in the @entity208 and the parade down @entity210			0
it is n't all pomp and circumstance , however			0
after being sworn in , the president will have an opportunity to tend to critical business			0
" there is a room at the @entity208 that is behind the cloak room on the @entity32 floor that is used only on the day that presidents are inaugurated , " @entity186 said			2
" what happens immediately after being sworn in is the president signs @entity225 appointments that have to happen right away			0
" @entity186 went on to say that if a transition team had prepared the executive orders , this would be the perfect time for the new president to make his first decisions in office			1
so could a president sign five bills and pass five executive orders in a day ? " it is perfectly within reason , " concluded @entity81			1
" it just depends on how motivated they are to do these things			0
" " this is the next four to eight years of their life -- they have to do it all , " said @entity186			0
" absolutely it is possible			0
