-- while some architects compete over height , others compete with shape			0
after @entity9 's " @entity8 ( aka the @entity7 ) hit monitors earlier this month , another eye - opening hotel design has just been announced -- also with a massive hole in the middle of the building			1
designed by @entity15 architecture firm @entity14 , the @entity16 ( the project 's working title ) resembles a tilted photo frame at the edge of a high cliff in @entity22 , @entity23			1
" @entity22 hasn ´ t got a representative iconic building that brings the more than 8 million inhabitants of the city to be well known worldwide , " @entity14 director @entity24 tells @entity0			1
" we wanted to create something radical , strong			0
a landmark , a building that makes you think , a shape that shakes your imagination			2
" we know that as soon as you do something that radical on such a dominant location there are going to be a lot of people hating it			0
and some of them also loving it			0
" this is what we want -- make people talk about architecture , and what to do and not to do with @entity22 's urban landscape			2
" bold purchase hugging a space between the @entity52 and the city , the unique shape of " @entity16 " ensures people behind the building wo n't have their views out to the ocean blocked			1
the bold dream , however , will be fulfilled only with the help of an equally bold investor			0
fortunately for @entity14 , a private @entity61 investor , who the company wo n't name , is said to be pleased with the design			1
" we were not sure if he was going to react ok to such a strong proposal , " says @entity24			0
" actually we had a b option ready just in case , but we never had to show it			0
" after a long silence he started to say nice things about the project , and he sees the economic potential of such a building design			2
now he is in love with it ! " the design is still in its development stage and nothing has been confirmed , so no construction or opening dates were given			2
if approved , the " @entity16 " is meant to serve as both a hotel and congress center , consisting of 125 rooms , restaurants , conference rooms and an exhibition space			1
the interior design will include " some spaces with non-vertical facades , and very spectacular hall and rooftop restaurants , " says @entity24			0
other outrageous designs from @entity14 include @entity96 , a spiky footbridge that looks like @entity23 crystal , and @entity99 , a wooden church that doubles as a public space in a small @entity102 village .			1

@entity15 design firm @entity14 has an imaginative design for its *upcoming* hotel project in @entity23
called " @entity16 , " the design resembles a tilted photo frame by the cliff
the design will avoid blocking sea views and aims to become a landmark for @entity22
