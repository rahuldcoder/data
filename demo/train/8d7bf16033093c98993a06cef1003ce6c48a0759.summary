-- @entity1 sent police reinforcements to its enclave of @entity4 , on @entity6 's north coast , on wednesday , after more than a thousand would - be immigrants to @entity8 from @entity9 and @entity10 rushed en masse to try to illegally enter @entity1			1
under cover of dense fog , on tuesday just before 8 a.m. , the young men climbed a section of the six - meter - tall , chain - link fence that had not been reinforced , while @entity6 and @entity1 security forces tried desperately to prevent them			1
about 500 made it in , and they were soon running toward an overcrowded immigrant holding center in @entity4 , shouting " bosa , bosa , " which means " victory , victory			1
" it was the biggest " assault " in nearly decade , surpassing the 350 immigrants who scampered inside @entity4 on a single day back in october 2005 , authorities said			2
on wednesday , @entity28 sent 120 additional police and civil guards to @entity4			1
the @entity1 government estimates there are 40,000 @entity34 migrants gathered in northern @entity6 who want to enter @entity4 or the other @entity1 enclave , @entity36 , hundreds of miles to the east and close to the @entity38			2
the government estimates an additional 40,000 migrants are gathered close to the border of @entity41 and @entity6 , with the intention of moving north to try to enter @entity1			1
on march 6 , @entity1 's interior minister @entity43 , on a visit to @entity36 , said the mass influx of immigrants was not just @entity1 's problem , but @entity8 's , and he called for more @entity49 cooperation			2
the immigrant - holding center in @entity4 now has about 1,800 residents -- more than triple its capacity			1
after tuesday 's latest influx , the @entity1 @entity54 and the army hastily erected 26 tents and expanded the perimeter of the center , where the migrants get meals , showers and medical care , said @entity64 of the @entity54			0
@entity1 media reported on wednesday that the government would soon need to transfer dozens or hundreds of the immigrants to the @entity1 mainland			2
that would put them closer to other @entity49 countries , like @entity73 , which have minimized controls at many internal @entity49 borders such as the @entity1 - @entity73 crossings			0
but the government had no immediate comment about potential transfers of migrants			0
the latest influx in @entity4 comes as controversy swirls around the events of last february 6 , when some 15 migrants drowned while trying to swim from @entity6 past a retaining wall and into @entity36			0
@entity1 police fired rubber bullets on that occasion , and rights groups allege this may have contributed to the deaths			0
the government says the rubber bullets were not aimed directly at the migrants			0
later on wednesday , a top @entity94 official is due to offer further explanations before @entity1 's parliament .			0
