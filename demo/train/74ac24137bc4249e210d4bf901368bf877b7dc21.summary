-- at dinner tables throughout the @entity3 , there are tough conversations about the exploding cost of college , the rough job market , the pain of debt			1
for parents and students , it adds up to the same question : is college worth it ? but @entity15 economics professor @entity14 is asking something different : if college is n't worth it , what else is out there ? @entity14 , an @entity19 fellow , has studied youth unemployment for decades , and thinks the @entity3 ought to try an updated version of an old technique for education and employment : apprenticeships			1
they 're not the same as an after - school fast food job or a summer internship at dad 's office , he said			1
apprenticeships require skill development in a workplace over a number of years			1
the education , which might be supplemented by classroom training , leads to a credential -- maybe a title , certification or diploma -- that proves mastery of a skill			1
during that time , apprentices are paid , and employers are getting another worker			0
" in many countries , apprenticeship training and mastery is thought of as a big advantage in innovation -- you have people seeing things , but have skills to understand them , make adjustments and achieve high quality , " @entity14 said			1
it 's been a long time since apprenticeship dominated in the @entity3			1
despite the @entity62 administration 's focus on community colleges , which often house workplace - learning programs , apprenticeship programs draw few government resources , and reach relatively few fields , mostly construction and manufacturing			0
in a paper published last year , @entity14 said about 468,000 people were in 27,000 apprenticeship programs registered with the @entity3 @entity72 in 2008			1
that was about .3 % of the workforce at the time			0
up to 1 million more were in unregistered programs , the report said			0
but in @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 , 50 % to 70 % of young people are trained through apprentice programs , according to " @entity82			1
" @entity14 suggests the @entity3 follow the example of countries that developed apprenticeships in fields including health care , information technology , finance , advanced manufacturing and maritime occupations			1
but that means getting through to politicians , educators , students and parents first			0
a @entity98 study published in may said 94 % of parents who responded expected their kids to go to college			1
the @entity98 study " @entity102 ? " pointed out that the median gap in yearly earnings between those with only a high school diploma and those who have a college degree is nearly $ 20,000 , according @entity110 data from 2010			1
but students doing poorly in high school are n't likely to thrive in a college classroom , @entity14 said , at least not right away			1
more options that do n't require a traditional college education might help lead people to higher - paying jobs , he said			1
" the fact is that no matter how quickly we move on expanding apprenticeship , college and academics are still going to have a big draw , and that 's fine , " he said			2
" but i think what we want to see is that diversification of routes to rewarding careers			0
" former auto worker : ' bypassing ' college a mistake here 's what @entity14 had to say about changing the way we think about paths for students after high school			1
@entity0 : what is apprenticeship , and how is it different than an after - school job or a summer internship ? @entity14 : it is far more in - depth than any internship and far more structured than a standard job			1
it involves in - depth learning on the job , as well as related instruction in classroom work			1
the employer has obligation to train the individual ; employers are getting production out of the apprentice			0
the apprentice is also being paid , and usually , almost always , there is an upward trajectory of pay over a two - to four - year period			2
@entity164 's @entity163 : cooking classes @entity0 : how did apprenticeships play a larger role in our past in the @entity3 , and why did it fade away ? @entity14 : i do n't think we ever had the scale of apprenticeship training that existed in other countries			1
we have become so academic - based in our thinking that we do n't take seriously the workplace learning component and occupational component			0
the whole field of vocational education is a very contested one			0
some people see vocational education as something to divert people away from higher goals of education			2
we went through a period when school - based vocational education , people argued , was used to discourage minority groups from going to college			1
@entity0 : how could we implement programs that would avoid tracking certain classes , races or ethnicities into non-college programs ? @entity14 : i 'm personally not worried			1
if you look at the college graduation rate of @entity200 males , it 's well under 20 %			2
let 's say we can double that , which is not easy to do -- the other people ( who do n't graduate ) should not be doomed to bad careers , nor should people be pushed only one way			1
i see entering apprenticeship as entirely voluntarily			0
you can have career - focused education and training that provides education at very high levels with outlets for people to move back into a purely academic programs if they so choose			2
some of the very good programs , it 's harder to get into an apprenticeship than to get into elite colleges			0
we need more good options			0
( with paid apprenticeships , ) there 's incentive			2
that reward would come much faster than trying to stay in school for 16 , 18 years and then maybe getting a good job			2
i am a professor of economics and i do not discourage people from taking higher education courses , but there are so many opportunities to do that over time			1
i met , for example , in @entity79 , a sales person in a steel mill. before he went to college , he went through a three - year apprenticeship at the steel mill in sales management			2
when we went to college , college was a lot easier			2
he had all that background			0
he was probably more mature then			0
he could recognize which things were going to be helpful to him			0
study : for grads of color , it 's prison or unemployment @entity0 : is part of the issue the word apprentice ? it 's tied to certain professions -- manufacturing , construction -- even if it describes work - based learning in fields like medicine and teaching			1
@entity14 : it does n't have as good a connotation as in other countries			1
the current administration is using " career pathways			0
" the problem is that " career pathways " is a vague term			0
it is n't clear you 're doing something in a serious and concerted way			0
an apprentice who completes a program , they have genuine expertise			0
that gives people a sense that , ' if i mastered this field , i can continue learning			2
i can learn other things as well			0
' to me , one of the great advantages is the sense of confidence it can give			0
ideally , we should try to make more and more fields have that high quality of productivity , but also a sense of pride			0
people in the welding field should have that same sense			2
laser welding , the design of welding , all of that can be very complicated , technical , advanced , productive and rewarding			0
maybe we should have a contest			0
what name would capture the full notion , and perhaps be considered snazzier than apprenticeship ? community colleges step in to fill ' skills gap ' @entity0 : is there an opening for apprenticeship programs now that has n't existed in the recent past ? @entity14 : college costs are rising dramatically , not only for individual families , but for governments			1
we 're seeing increasing concern that many people are not doing well at high school levels			2
there is starting to be an openness to these kinds of initiatives , but you can not understate the purely academic bias that is existing in policymakers and a strong education lobby			0
a public initiative has to recognize it 's a very different model than supporting slots in community college or training program			2
what apprenticeship investments require is marketing and technical assistance to get employers to adopt apprenticeship programs			0
that 's where government investment needs to be			0
i 'm not trying to knock college , especially for the broader learning you can get if you devote yourself to it ... but we have to create a wider range of options for people .			1

as college costs rise and job *hunts* get tougher , some question : why go to college ?
@entity363 professor says @entity3 should develop more apprenticeships
apprenticeships teach people a skill -- and pay them -- as they work toward certification
@entity14 says apprenticeships have been *valuable* in other countries
