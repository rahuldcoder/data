" if you talk to the citrus farmers whose citrus rotted on the port , that 's damage that has been done			2
" @entity0 added , however , that he believes the conflict was resolved before it could do more permanent damage to country 's 2015 economic outlook			1
" 2014 was the best year since the late 90s in terms of job growth and we see a real hop in the step of this economy , " he said			2
" i think in the grand scheme , i 'm confident that we can recover quickly			1

the two parties were unable to come to an agreement and have been without a contract since july			0
the standoff has been a nightmare for @entity3 businesses that use the @entity6 ports to import and export their goods			0
