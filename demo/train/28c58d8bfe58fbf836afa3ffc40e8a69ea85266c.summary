-- users have one week to vote on the proposed changes to @entity4 's policy , including the ability of users to vote on future privacy changes			1
voting opened on monday , and users have until monday , december 10 , at noon @entity10 to make their opinions heard			0
@entity4 has put up a custom voting app powered by a third - party company for this vote , and the results will be tallied by an independent auditor			1
" this feedback allows us to respond to your questions and make substantive changes to our proposals before they are implemented , " @entity18 , @entity4 's vice president of communications and public policy , said in a blog post announcing the vote			1
@entity4 proposed the latest changes to its @entity29 and @entity30 on november 21			1
users and privacy groups immediately expressed concerns over the modifications			0
in addition to a proposed end to public voting on these types of issues , @entity4 wanted to change to how users control who can send them messages			1
also , an addition to the @entity29 would allow @entity4 to share data with affiliated business , such as @entity46			1
on friday , two privacy groups , the @entity47 and the @entity48 , sent an open letter to @entity4 ceo @entity50 objecting to the proposal			2
" because these proposed changes raise privacy risks for users , may be contrary to law , and violate your previous commitments to users about site governance , we urge you to withdraw the proposed changes , " read the letter			2
they also say the changes could violate @entity4 's settlement with the @entity68 , in which the social network said it would obtain consent from users before sharing their personal data with third parties , and provide users with clear notice when that information is shared			1
@entity4 has a rocky history with privacy changes and resulting backlash from members			2
in 2009 , the site made previously private data such as friend lists and profile photos public by default			0
the following year , users were automatically oped into a new " @entity90 " feature that shared private information with outside companies such as @entity89			0
the outpouring of comments on the @entity4 post announcing the proposed policy updates was huge			2
more than 20,000 people commented on the post , voicing concerns over the company 's proposed updates			0
" i do n't want advertisers to have my information			0
i made this account back in 2005 as a way to keep in touch with friends , not be bombarded by ever increasing advertisements , " commented user @entity103			0
in that post , @entity4 also proposed to end public voting on changes to site governance			1
the voting option was first rolled out in 2009 in response to privacy complaints over a chance to the sites term of use			1
at the time , @entity4 had just 175 million users			2
this voting app is a improvement over the previous system			0
past votes just required 7,000 users to comment on an official @entity4 post			2
@entity4 said the reason it wanted to do away with votes was that the comment system valued " quantity over quality , " a problem the new system already seems to address			0
there are about 1 billion people on @entity4 , not including bots or fake accounts			0
@entity4 will require 30 % of those active registered users to take part in the vote for the outcome to be binding			1
if less than that percent vote , the company will take the results under advisement			0
getting 300 million @entity4 users to vote could be difficult , especially with the lack of viral appeal such as a fake lottery ticket			1
in addition to voting and commenting , @entity4 users can join a live webcast on tuesday , during which @entity4 officials will answer questions			1
fake lottery winner may be @entity4 's most shared image some irked by @entity4 's new pages for couples opinion : does @entity4 hurt your college chances ?			0
