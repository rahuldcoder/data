-- inside the @entity2 workshop on the outskirts of @entity4 , @entity5 's capital , a group of women sit side by side against a brightly - painted wall			1
using natural fibers and grasses , they pool their weaving skills to create exquisite hand - made baskets , inspired by the eastern @entity18 country 's art and tradition			0
seeing these women talking , laughing and working together , it 's hard to imagine that many of them were once enemies , belonging to warring tribes during the 1994 @entity5 genocide			1
" [ it 's ] really amazing to see how a small piece of work , how culture can restore values in people , how healing comes through a small basket , " says @entity27 , co-founder of @entity28 , the company that has made @entity5 's hand - woven baskets internationally famous			1
" and then people open up , forgive one another and get back together			0
they say hello , they interact , they visit , they share what they used to share before , " adds @entity27 , a master weaver herself			2

" if you just meet someone on the streets and go - you do n't really heal from what you went through , " says one of the women at the workshop			0

" an estimated 800,000 @entity75 and politically - moderate @entity76 were murdered in just 100 days during the @entity5 genocide nearly two decades ago			2
after the violence ended , many @entity5 women whose husbands , fathers and sons were killed found themselves thrust into the unfamiliar role of being sole breadwinners for their families			1
at the same time , @entity5 who had fled the genocide and earlier internal conflicts started returning in droves from neighboring countries			2
one of them was @entity27 -- decades ago , she had fled to @entity91 where she grew up in a refugee camp			2
upon her return to the country , @entity27 opened a hotel with her elder sister in @entity4			2
many traumatized women and children would often come to the hotel to beg for food			0

" a lady walked in with a basket and said , ' can you take this basket and give me something to eat			0
' " that prompted @entity27 to start encouraging the distressed women to bring their woven baskets to the hotel so they could sell them to the hotel guests			1
" we started organizing women and we started trying to make the baskets so fine so that they suit in the market , " says @entity27			1
" and in that sense , they restored their dignity			0
" @entity27 's efforts to empower the underprivileged women of @entity5 cultivated to the creation of @entity2 -- the company started operations in 2004 with only 27 women			1

" once you earn an income , " says @entity27 , " you are economically empowered			2
you are given a voice , you can argue your values , you can argue your point , you can argue your rights			0

" when you look at what women are doing , it is like what men used to do			0
