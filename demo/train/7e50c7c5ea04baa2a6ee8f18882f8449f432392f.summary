-- is anybody out there ? for millennia , humans have gazed at the night sky , asking this question			2
that 's why scientists and @entity9 are eagerly searching for " exoplanets " -- that is , planets that orbit around stars other than our sun. last week @entity9 's @entity17 satellite reported the discovery of three @entity20 - sized exoplanets within the so - called " habitable zone , " defined as the neighborhood of a star where liquid water -- essential for life as we know it -- can exist			1
in our solar system , only three planets lie in the sun 's habitable zone -- @entity32 , @entity20 and @entity33			1
planets too close to the star they orbit , like @entity37 , are too hot for liquid water			2
even @entity32 turns out to be too hot , thanks to a runaway greenhouse effect caused by its carbon dioxide - rich atmosphere			2
planets farther from their star , like @entity43 , are too cold , at least on its surface -- although @entity48 , one of @entity43 's moons , may have oceans of liquid water beneath an icy crust			1
3 new planets could host life say hello to the three new exoplanets : @entity57 and @entity17 62f orbit are the fifth and sixth planets orbiting the star @entity61 , and @entity62 is the third planet orbiting -- you guessed it -- @entity17 69			1
all three are nearly the same size as our @entity20			0
@entity68 has a diameter 40 % larger than the @entity20 's			2
it orbits its star once every 267 days , very similar to the 225 - day period of @entity32			2
we do not know what @entity68 is made of but other exoplanets of a similar size are known to be rocky , so that 's the best guess for now			2
@entity57 is about 60 % larger than the @entity20 and is probably hotter because it lies at the inner edge of the habitable zone , in a 122 - day orbit -- slightly longer than @entity37 's 88 - day orbit			1
you can see a pattern : the shorter the orbital period , the closer the planet is to its star			0
for physics lovers , this follows directly from @entity88 's law of gravity -- but that 's a lesson for another time			2
for now , i can tell you that one @entity37 - year is 88 @entity20 - days , one @entity32 - year is 225 @entity20 - days , one @entity20 - year is 365 days , and one @entity43 year is about 12 @entity20 - years			2
( by " year " i mean the time that a planet takes to orbit its star			0
by " day " i mean the rotation period of the planet			0
what a " day " or " year " means clearly depends on the planet ! ) since @entity61 is a cooler star than our sun , planets can orbit closer to it than the @entity20 can to our sun before overheating			2
in contrast , the third @entity20 - like planet , @entity62 , orbits a star very similar to our sun ( that is , hotter than @entity61 )			2
it is 70 % larger than the @entity20 and orbits @entity17 69 once every 242 days -- very like @entity32			0
@entity109 , noted exoplanet hunter and my colleague at @entity112 , explained the significance of the discovery : " the radii of these planets makes them the smallest ever detected outside the solar system			0
the host star is about a billion years older than our @entity120 , so it is intriguing to speculate about whether life might inhabit these planets			1
" we know from scientific studies on @entity20 that , given the right chemical elements and some energy , organic compounds form			0
living organisms have been found even in apparently inhospitable regions of the @entity20 , like the driest deserts or @entity132 , or near thermal vents in the black depths of the ocean			0
with the right ingredients , it seems , life is nearly impossible to prevent			0
we do n't know for sure whether there is life on @entity32 or @entity33			1
if there is , it 's unlikely to look like @entity142 , canal - building aliens , or any other science fiction - type fantasy			1
walking , talking aliens would have been visible decades ago to telescopes and rovers			0
but could there be intelligent life in another planetary system , in orbit around one of the 100 billion other stars in our @entity156 galaxy ? could we communicate with them ? could we visit them ? the @entity17 satellite was designed to look for planets around each of about 100,000 stars			1
as of april 19 , 2013 , the @entity166 's @entity165 website reports 851 confirmed planets and 2781 candidates , totaling as many as 3,632 exoplanets			1
most were discovered by scientists using @entity17 data -- and a few were found by ordinary citizens analyzing @entity17 data at @entity175			0
we ca n't travel to the nearest stars in a human lifetime -- such a journey would take tens of thousands of years with current technology			1
but we do have the technology to speak to distant civilizations			0
in fact , we 've been broadcasting television signals to the cosmos for more than 80 years			0
we have had the technology to explore space and to communicate over long distances for less than 100 years -- a tiny fraction of the few million years since the first humans , much less the 4.5 billion years since the @entity20 formed			1
so it is likely that any other technologically sophisticated civilization would be far more advanced than we			0
that means they probably could let us know they were here , if they wanted to			0
for now , we can keep sending our tv broadcasts , listening for their broadcasts and studying exoplanets for signs of life			0
thursday , at a meeting of the @entity9 science advisory committee i serve on , @entity9 associate administrator for @entity201 and astronaut @entity202 finished his presentation by giving us a heads up about the exciting @entity17 exoplanet discoveries			1
as he said in the press release , we are " a bit closer to finding a place like home			0
it is only a matter of time before we know if the galaxy is home to a multitude of planets like @entity20 , or if we are a rarity			0
" after our committee meeting ended today , i asked one of the @entity9 audio - visual staff whether he had heard about the new exoplanets			1
" oh yes , " he answered , " the ones in the habitable zone			0
" he asked whether life might exist on one of these planets , and whether we could visit them			1
such ideas are why he is thrilled to work at @entity9			1
people want to learn about life elsewhere in the universe			1
we want to visit those planets , to see what creatures live there , to compare to our own world -- to learn what is out there			0
thanks to @entity17 , @entity9 , dedicated scientists and curious citizens , we are that much closer to finding out			1
more space and science news from @entity0 @entity246 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity249 .			1

people have always wondered whether there 's life in outer space
@entity249 says last week 's *announcement* by @entity9 shed new light on the question
*kepler* satellite found three planets in zones capable of supporting life , she says
@entity249 : we ca n't journey to such far off planets but we can try to communicate with far - away life
