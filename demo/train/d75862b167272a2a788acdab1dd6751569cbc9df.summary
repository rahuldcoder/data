@entity1 , @entity0 -- who : @entity4 of @entity1 , @entity0 what 's with the nickname : it 's an abbreviation of his name and the title of his personal blog			1
why you might know him : he worked in research and development at @entity16 and @entity17 , owns a handful of patents and is considered an influential tech thinker			2
his mobile - app company , @entity22 , built the interactive " @entity28 and the monster at the @entity30 " for " @entity31 " and recently launched the @entity24 application for @entity26 's tablet publication , @entity27			1
he likes the @entity33 festival , where we caught up with him : @entity22 launched last year at @entity33			1
@entity4 , one of its co-founders , has been attending the festival since 1993			2
how @entity22 develops products : " we 're actually designing the app in our imaginations now and then backing that up and going out to these manufacturers with what we need			1
we 're starting to see things progress at such a fast pace			2
literally every year there 's a new @entity47 , there 's a new thing , and that gives us -- with the proper planning -- time to think about the limitations of the device , build out something and know that the devices will eventually catch up			0
or possibly we could even influence to catch up to it sooner			0
" his thoughts on innovation : " if you think about the progress of technology , at what point do we hit that glass ceiling ? there are people i know that would have said @entity68 is a wall , and now we 've broken past that			0
it 's our job as technologists to drive forward past those walls , and that requires something that is close to me , which is better education of people , " he said			0
" that is what prevents us from hitting that wall			0
" why he favors an online resource where app developers could access and share information : " why not take and open source some of that and make it a communal process ? instead of rewriting 80 % of the software that is the same on all of those applications , why not focus on the 20 % that makes it different and really worthwhile to the user ? " why he thinks mobile computing will be even bigger in 2012 : " when we were here ( at @entity33 ) last year , we heard it was going to be the year of the tablet			1
you expected to see not just tablets , but customized tablets for verticals , medical and restaurants and all these different things , and that really has n't happened			0
" so next year i think you 're going to see yet another increase in mobile , because for computing to become ubiquitous and pervasive , clearly we have to take it with us			2
and everyone wants to be new and novel by doing mobile stuff , but the reality is that everything will eventually be mobile or at least have a mobile competent			0
" @entity4 also hopes to see more applications that allow you to share information across devices , such as an app for your tv that syncs with your tablet and your phone .			1
