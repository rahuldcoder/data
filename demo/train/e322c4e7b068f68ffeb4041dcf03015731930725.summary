-- climbing up the spiral stairs and through a stone tower to our room , we notice a passageway			2
" where do you suppose it goes ? " asks my wife , @entity6 , as she signals me to follow her			2
stop for coffee and cake at the 11th - century @entity14 hotel - restaurant in @entity15			1
we emerge atop a medieval parapet			2
on our left is the steeply banked @entity18 and the vineyards that line the winding @entity20 ; to our right is a medieval inner courtyard with a multilevel patchwork of romanesque arches , half - timbered chambers and tumbledown stonework			2
i 'd first stumbled upon the @entity27 while traveling through @entity29 's @entity28 four years earlier			1
the 13th - century fortress had struck me as one of the most hauntingly romantic places in @entity33			1
and so here we are on our honeymoon , the first leg of a two - week journey through the @entity18 : south along the @entity37 ( " @entity37 " ) , to the @entity38 ( appropriately , " @entity38 " ) , then north toward the vibrant city of @entity40			1
@entity41 to @entity42 : 90 miles from the @entity43 , we drive an hour northwest to the town of @entity41 , contending with jet lag and a torrential downpour			1
as the @entity27 comes into view , however , the unforgiving weather subsides and we forget our desperate need for sleep			1
@entity0 : guide to @entity29 's @entity52 darkened by storm clouds , the crumbling fortress commands the valley with a sphinxlike gravitas			1
its stones have survived countless histories : throughout the @entity61 wealthy nobles lived here , accumulating monies from river traffic tolls ; during the 17th - century @entity66 , the @entity65 set the castle on fire ; it was abandoned for more than two centuries until , in the late 1800 's , an @entity70 of @entity29 descent purchased the property and sold it to another family , who turned it into a hotel in the 1950 's			1
our wood - paneled room , an octagonal chamber at the top of the highest tower in the hotel , resembles an officer 's quarters on a sailing ship : the bed is built into a windowed alcove , high off the floor , so we have to climb a semicircular stepladder to reach it			1
a doorway leads to a tiny stone balcony overlooking the valley			2
i ca n't help thinking of @entity92 locked away in her belfry			2
with the castle as our base , we explore the @entity28 , stopping at small villages along the valley floor and amid the forests on the plateau above the river			0
at the @entity101 ( " @entity102 " ) , a stone - walled restaurant with a wood - beamed ceiling , dogs and children run around freely , popping up every so often at our table , which had been made from an old wooden bed			0
the place strikes me as the very essence of @entity111 , the peculiarly @entity29 nostalgia for connection with home and homeland			1
the notion is reflected in the food we eat -- the ingredients of our sauerbraten have been raised a literal stone 's throw away -- and the welcoming , laid - back staff are locals			1
the road heading south of @entity41 takes us to the university town of @entity42 , with its stone - arched bridges spanning the @entity127 and the grand , 12th - century @entity128 perched above the town on a high promontory			1
@entity6 and i trek up a narrow cobblestoned alley , past gabled stone houses with ancient doorways , and through a lush green park until we reach the castle			0
what was once a thick - walled tower now stands torn in half , the remnants of centuries of warfare			0
but as old ruins always do , the broken masonry now radiates calm in the cool autumn sunlight			0
@entity42 to @entity145 : 100 miles east of @entity42 , the @entity37 follows the course of the @entity127 , along which castles emerge from the crests of hills like capped mushrooms			1
we excitedly count each one , like kids on a road trip spotting license plates			0
at the town of @entity15 , in the @entity156 , we pull a hard left to @entity14 , an 11th - century keep , where we stop for coffee and cake on the castle 's terrace , with a view of the red - roofed village below			1
the walled city of @entity145 is one of the few towns in the @entity156 that has remained virtually untouched since the 17th century			1
and for the next couple of days , we stay on its main street in a storied old pile called the @entity169			0
@entity0 : the world 's best hotels once among the most prosperous towns in @entity29 , @entity145 suffered an outbreak of the plague in the early 1600s and was sacked soon after in the @entity175			1
the town never recovered , and as a consequence , little was built ; the city is a medieval time capsule of half - timbered houses and arched gateways that pass through the bases of stone towers			2
despite being a picture - perfect town full of tourists , @entity145 , truth be told , is not the most exciting place			1
it is , however , known for the @entity189			0
in the busy basement enoteca , decidedly less pricey and formal than the fine - dining room upstairs , dark walnut tables are full of hip young locals ; it 's like being back in the 21st century			1
the owner , 42 - year - old @entity195 , is a voluble , bearlike man who apprenticed as a butcher as a teenager , before managing a small hotel just outside of town			2
after a glass of red wine and some goat ragoût , we ask his advice on the best vineyard in the region to visit			0
" mine ! " he says			0
" meet me at nine tomorrow morning and i 'll take you myself			0
" @entity208 der @entity209 to @entity40 : 165 miles true to his word , @entity195 shows up the next morning , and together we drive north through pastureland and orchards brimming with apples and pears -- it 's no wonder the @entity29 call this the @entity38			1
up the side of a steep ridge sits @entity195 's winery , @entity220 , where we try the @entity222 grapes and take in the valley below			2
@entity0 : 10 unexpected @entity70 wine trails " there is the @entity209 , which means fish ; the mill , which means grain and bread ; the fields with sheep , which means meat and wool ; and beyond , the village , " he says			0
" from this one spot , i can see everything that is important to me , and no factory in sight			0
it must have been like this 500 years ago			0
" on the way back , @entity195 insists we stop at @entity242 , where his cousin owns a hotel - restaurant called @entity245			0
it 's a thursday , one of the two days each week when his cousin , @entity248 , makes fresh bratwurst from pork butchered in town			1
@entity248 serves each of us a pair of perfectly grilled sausages over sauerkraut , with a glass of local @entity222 , before we head out			0
after dropping @entity195 back in @entity145 , we drive north on the @entity38 toward @entity40 , a town of an altogether different provenance			1
if @entity145 is a time machine to the @entity61 , then @entity40 is a portal to the @entity259 ; @entity260 and @entity261 both lived in the city center during some of their most productive years			1
as we cruise down the tree - lined streets , the country 's genteel past comes to life , with stately slate - roofed houses rising from walled - in yards			2
the @entity274 movement was founded here in 1919			0
judging by its modern interiors , you would never suspect that our hotel , the 313 - year - old @entity280 , was once the preferred meeting spot for intellectuals like @entity283			0
for dinner , we head to the nearby @entity285 , a @entity287 - style pavilion jutting out from the side of the historic hotel @entity289			0
@entity291 lived in the hotel building in 1912 , as did his longtime friend @entity293			0
outside , the weather has turned cool and crisp			0
i pull @entity6 close and together we set off , our footfalls echoing off the cobblestones			0
