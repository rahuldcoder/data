-- nearly 12 years after @entity4 debated and subsequently voted for @entity6 military action in @entity7 , another debate over that @entity3 country is roiling @entity8			1
this debate is not taking place on the floors of the @entity12 or @entity13 ; it is taking place in the media			0
members of @entity4 and even the former vice president who helped plan the @entity6 invasion of @entity7 more than a decade ago took to the sunday political talk shows to voice their positions			2
as militants , which president @entity22 said sunday on @entity25 ' " @entity24 " poses a " medium and long - term threat			2
" continue to gain ground in @entity7 , we 'll get you up to speed on what top officials in @entity8 said in the sunday political shows			2
lacking intelligence now that @entity22 has announced his plans for @entity7 , which includes sending up to 300 military " advisers " to the country , the blame game on how @entity7 dissolved into chaos continues			1
sen. @entity40 , @entity41 and chairwoman of the @entity43 , said the intelligence community was not fully aware of the scope of the @entity46 in @entity7 and @entity47			1
she said intelligence did " know about " @entity48 in @entity47 , but it did not adequately account for the possibility that the group could overtake a third of @entity7 so quickly			1
" this is a difficult culture , " @entity40 said on @entity0 's " @entity53			2
" " it is very difficult to pierce			0
" she added that @entity6 intelligence has holes in places other than @entity7 , including @entity60 and @entity61			1
" the world is a big place , " she said , " and this is extraordinarily difficult to do			0
" her counterpart in the @entity12 , chairman @entity64 , disagreed , insisting intelligence gathering did not fail			1
in @entity7 , militants press on toward @entity67 view from @entity67 : answering your questions about @entity7 crisis the blame game everyone points fingers			1
and they 're all pointed in a different direction			0
it " was a policy failure , " @entity64 said on @entity25 ' " @entity24			2
" @entity64 said @entity22 's inaction is what led to the quick rise of @entity48 in @entity7 , insisting that not " dealing with " @entity48 earlier " has got us a bigger problem			1
" " we did n't do anything in @entity47 ; we did n't do anything when they took @entity85 ; we did n't do anything when they took @entity88 ; they got into @entity90 and said , ' hey this is a problem , ' " he said			0
4 western @entity7 towns fall to advancing @entity48 militants that 's a sentiment expressed by former vice president @entity95			1
after writing a scathing op - ed slamming @entity22 for " being " so wrong about so much , " @entity95 came out swinging again , this time on @entity97 's " @entity98			1
" " i think he 's dead wrong in terms of the course he 's taken this nation , and i think we 're in for big trouble in the years ahead because of his refusal to recognize reality and because of his continual emphasis upon getting the @entity6 basically to withdraw from that part of the world , " @entity95 said			1
during the @entity112 administration , @entity95 played a key role in urging the @entity6 - led invasion of @entity7 in 2003 to search for weapons of mass destruction , a hunt that ultimately proved fruitless			1
@entity95 has remained a supporter of the war in @entity7			1
he said @entity22 " left a big vacuum " by not agreeing to a deal with the @entity7 government to leave @entity6 troops behind after the war ended			1
like @entity95 , @entity125 sen. @entity124 also said the @entity6 has " created a vacuum			1
" but that 's where their agreement ends			0
@entity124 said , " i do blame the @entity130 on the chaos that is in the @entity3			1
i also blame those who are for the @entity130 for emboldening @entity133			2
" he said @entity133 has benefited from @entity135 and @entity136 conflict in the region			0
" what 's going on now , i do n't blame on president @entity22 , " he added on @entity139 's " @entity138			1
" sen. @entity142 , @entity41 , who was one of 23 senators who voted against going to war with @entity7 in 2002 , said on @entity25 ' " @entity24 " that @entity95 's vocal input is " a nightmare come back to haunt me			1
" " the fact is what you 're seeing now is an outgrowth of that bad policy the neocons got us in -- that crowd on false pretense that said , ' go in there			0
' " as @entity48 advances toward @entity67 , a call for fighting volunteers is answered the role of @entity47 as @entity48 gained strength and clout by fighting in @entity47 's civil war against president @entity163 , @entity142 dismissed argument made by many in the @entity166 that a hands - off approach in @entity47 is what emboldened @entity48			2
" the hawks are saying the president knew that @entity48 was in @entity47 and did n't want them to get control of the weapons , " @entity142 said			2
but @entity124 said the limited @entity6 role in @entity47 was too much and that 's what emboldened @entity48			1
he said the minimal weapons , vehicles and communications equipment the @entity6 sent to @entity48 gave them greater capability			0
" here 's the anomaly			0
we 're with isis in @entity47			0
we 're on the same side of the war			0
so , those who want to get involved to stop @entity48 in @entity7 are allied with @entity48 in @entity47			1
that is the real contradiction to this whole policy , " @entity124 said on @entity0 's " @entity53			2
" @entity7 history facts @entity3 borders will never be the same @entity6 action @entity22 has received a mixed response from those in @entity4 as well as outside observers for his measured response to the crisis , including sending military advisers who " will be prepared to take targeted and precise military action if and when we determine that the situation on the ground requires it			1
" he also sent secretary of state @entity202 to @entity203 and the @entity3 to engage allies and interested parties in the crisis			0
emphasizing @entity202 's diplomatic trip , @entity22 said in a portion of an interview aired sunday that the @entity6 is not going to deal with @entity7 unilaterally			1
he also said the @entity6 has to have a " more focused , more targeted strategy " as extremist groups are active throughout the @entity3 and @entity60			0
" [ @entity213 ] we ca n't do is think that we 're just going to play @entity215 and send @entity6 troops occupying various countries wherever these organizations pop up , " @entity22 said on @entity25 ' " @entity24 , " echoing remarks he made in a news conference thursday			2
@entity95 , however , wants troops -- and more of them			0
" when we 're arguing over 300 advisers when the request had been for 20,000 in order to do the job right , i 'm not sure we 've really addressed the problem , " he said on " @entity98			0
" and @entity95 said if it were up to him , he would assist the @entity7 army with training and provide @entity136 with weapons " to be able to do a more effective job			1
" @entity64 criticized the president 's overall philosophy on the region			2
" and it 's not @entity235 , this is in our national security interest			0
bumper sticker phrases are n't gon na win this thing , " @entity64 said			2
" we 've got ta be dug in for the long haul because they 're dug in for the long haul			0
" opinion : @entity22 's sensible @entity7 plan is likely doomed opinion : can @entity22 avoid mission creep ? @entity22 , however , has his supporters			1
" i think the president is doing the right thing , " @entity40 said			0
" he 's being a bit circumspect			0
" rep. @entity252 of @entity253 , chairman of the @entity254 , said the president 's actions are " a little late , " but he added , " i do think they 're on the right track now in terms of this dual strategy			0
" @entity142 said she agrees with the president			0
" we 're not going to go back into that war again , ever , " she said on @entity25 ' " @entity24			0
" @entity124 , who does n't believe @entity48 is an immediate threat to the @entity6 , said he 'd be cautious about any further action , wanting to see whether the @entity136 are going to stand up and fight			1
" [ am ] i willing to send my son to retake back a city , @entity88 , that they were n't willing to defend themselves ? i 'm not willing to send my son into that mess , " @entity124 said on " @entity53			2
" @entity269 sen. @entity268 , a member of the @entity271 committees but also a potential contender for the 2016 presidential race , differentiated himself from @entity124 , a possible presidential challenger			2
he said on " @entity24 " that he hopes @entity22 's plan is " not simply a symbolic measure " but " the first step in a multistep process			0
" @entity268 advocated for a plan similar to @entity95 's that included airstrikes to cut off @entity48 's supply lines from @entity47 and to " potentially " hit @entity48 's command structure			1
" the reason that @entity283 was able to carry out the 9/11 attacks is because they had a safe operating space in @entity286 that the @entity287 had given them			0
and now history is trying to repeat itself here , " @entity268 said			0
@entity22 said @entity48 fighting " could spill over into some of our , you know , allies like @entity293			1
" @entity64 was more direct : " it 's not that they may have designs on @entity293 , they do have designs on @entity293			0
" @entity202 : @entity6 would communicate with @entity133 , not work with it , against @entity48			0

sen. @entity40 said intelligence was n't fully aware of the swift capabilities of @entity48 .
rep. @entity64 said intelligence is n't to blame , policy is .
former *vp* @entity95 said @entity22 is " dead wrong " on @entity7
sen. @entity124 blamed the @entity130 for creating chaos in the region
