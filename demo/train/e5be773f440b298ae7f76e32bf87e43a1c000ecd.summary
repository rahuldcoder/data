-- the deal ending the shutdown may not have put a dent in @entity4 , but the battle over implementing the health coverage law is not over			0
@entity0 @entity7 : @entity4 one venue that @entity9 are turning to for leverage , starting next week : oversight hearings , beginning with some tough questions about why the rollout of the website for enrolling in health care exchanges is having so many problems			1
" the @entity21 people deserve to know what caused this mess , " said rep. @entity17 , @entity18 , chairman of the @entity19			1
" delays and technical failures have reached epidemic proportions			2
" @entity27 : website glitches unacceptable @entity17 has already asked officials from the @entity30 to brief his committee on the problems at a hearing scheduled for next thursday			1
he also is asking them to turn over records of their communications with website contractors about the preparations for the site 's launch , and the problems people have had trying to use it			2
logging into @entity44 tough for some early registrants additionally , the chair of the @entity47 , rep. @entity48 , last week wrote to @entity30 secretary @entity49 demanding information about the rollout problems			1
joining him was sen. @entity52 , ranking @entity9 on the @entity54 committee on health , education , labor and pensions			1
@entity30 official : @entity49 not available to testify thursday one issue has been the ability to log in to @entity44			1
a senior administration official told @entity0 some users , especially those who signed up " early on , " have been having trouble logging in , but the administration is working on a fix			0
there also was conflicting word on whether some passwords were deleted if they were created in the first week or so after the launch			0
@entity49 concedes there have been implementation difficulties			0
" i 'll be the first to tell you that the website launch was rockier than we would have liked , " she told an audience in @entity74 on wednesday , during her tour to promote @entity4			0
but , she told @entity0 affiliate @entity79 , " there are constant improvements under way , so that we are getting people in much more quickly			0
" nevertheless , a couple of @entity9 have called on @entity49 to resign			1
" enough is enough , " said sen. @entity86 , who has called for her to step down in spite of being a longtime friend of her family			2
" @entity92 has had three and a half years to launch @entity4 , and she has failed			0
" rep. @entity93 of @entity94 tells @entity0 he is working to collect signatures calling for @entity49 to leave			0
@entity97 spokesman @entity96 pushed back on tuesday			1
" the secretary does have the full confidence of the president , " he told reporters			2
and when he was asked thursday who would be held accountable for the problems with the website , @entity96 replied , " the people who are responsible for making it work are hard at work , fixing the problems that need to be fixed			1
" he focused instead on the benefits the uninsured @entity21 are now entitled to			1
" the result will be millions of @entity21 who have insurance who did not have it before			1
and the goal is not about the website			0
the goal is that the @entity21 people who have been shut out of affordable health care options in the past have those options available to them			2
" but former @entity97 spokesman @entity124 , while not naming names , said of the website on @entity126 , " when they get it fixed , i hope they fire some people that were in charge			1
" @entity124 : fire those who botched website public attention may have been focused more on the shutdown fight this month than the problems with enrolling in the exchanges			0
but with the shutdown ended , part of the emerging @entity9 message is that the problems with the @entity4 website reflect broader problems with the law overall			1
" i think this is emblematic of how problematic this is going to be in the future , " said @entity93			0
at a minimum , the implementation of the individual mandate , requiring people to get health care , should be delayed , he said			0
but a spokeswoman for @entity49 said the online enrollment process is proceeding			0
" while traffic is down somewhat from its peak on day one , it remains high as @entity21 continue to seek to learn more about their new coverage options , " said spokeswoman @entity156			2
how many have signed up for health care ? well , it depends			0
