-- with each day , the hunt for @entity2 becomes one of the most baffling mysteries of the modern era , but history offers many great quests in which mankind searched for something or someone lost			1
these are epic searches , based on legend or fact , ending successfully , tragically , or sometimes not at all : the @entity14 there are many great biblical searches : @entity18 's @entity17			1
but there 's nothing like the @entity14			1
indeed , it 's a metaphor for any monumental search			1
it 's not clear what the @entity14 exactly was , but it 's said to be the shallow cup from @entity28 's @entity27 and from his crucifixion , where the vessel took blood flowing from his side			1
some believe @entity34 brought the grail to @entity36 , where it lies hidden			1
not even legendary @entity38 and his knights could find it , though their crusade inspired lore and romance			1
the @entity44 @entity44 was a @entity36 luxury passenger ship that sank in 1912 during its maiden voyage from @entity47 , @entity48 , to @entity49			1
the ocean liner was touted as " unsinkable " -- until it met an iceberg in the @entity52 around midnight on april 14 - 15 , 1912			1
about 1,500 of the more than 2,200 people aboard the @entity44 died			1
for decades , the ship was considered forever lost at the bottom of the ocean -- until 1985 , when scientists found the wreckage on the seabed			1
its story inspired director @entity62 to make the @entity64 tragic love tale " titanic " in 1997			1
@entity66 447 a long search for a commercial airliner like @entity2 is n't unprecedented			1
in 2009 , @entity69 plunged into the @entity52 during a storm , killing all 228 people aboard			2
the precise location of the wreckage remained a mystery for almost two years			2
then the plane and its dead were found in a mountain range deep on the ocean floor			1
miniature submersible vehicles retrieved the @entity69 's voice and flight data recorders			2
that allowed investigators to blame the crash on a series of errors by the pilots and a failure to react effectively to technical problems			2
nine aviation mysteries highlight long history of plane disappearances @entity93 the disappearance of @entity95 leader @entity93 remains a subject of relentless speculation and macabre jokes			2
he vanished on july 30 , 1975 , after he stood outside the @entity100 restaurant in @entity101 and made a phone call			2
he was never heard from again			2
his name makes news anytime @entity105 agents and police are seen holding shovels			2
lore holds that @entity93 was killed and buried			2
but where ? @entity110 the swashbuckling aviatrix and pioneering woman embarked on the first around - the - world flight at the @entity114 in june 1937			2
after completing about two - thirds of the flight , she and navigator @entity116 disappeared after their plane took off from @entity120 , @entity121			2
they were heading to the @entity124 outpost of @entity125 -- a distance equaling a transcontinental @entity128 flight			2
a search never found any trace of her , @entity132 or their plane			1
some believe they ran out of fuel and crashed into the sea -- similar to one theory of what happened to the @entity141 plane			2
@entity142 in the fourth century @entity144 , the philosopher @entity143 spoke of an ancient utopia that existed 9,000 years before , a place called @entity142			0
made of concentric islands rich with gold , silver and exotic life , @entity142 descended into depravity , @entity143 said , until earthquakes and tsunamis ultimately destroyed it			0
over time , thinkers and writers began trying to place @entity142 in real countries and lands , even @entity128			0
at a minimum , @entity142 lives on in the imagination , thanks to one of @entity164 civilization 's greatest philosophers			1
seven cities of gold it 's one thing to imagine of a paradise like @entity142			0
it 's quite another to actually voyage into a strange new world in search of one			1
that 's what the @entity175 explorers did in the 1500s , driven by a tall tale told by natives of how the @entity180 held seven cities of gold			0
in their lust for wealth , the @entity175 traveled through modern @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186 in search of @entity188			1
when they arrived in @entity189 , they finally quit			0
they never found the seven lost cities of gold			1
tomb of @entity194 and @entity195 @entity194 , the great queen of @entity196 , died in 30 b.c. and was buried with her lover , @entity195			1
the couple 's great passion has been captured in theater and film , thanks to @entity203 on stage and @entity205 in film			1
but for some adventurers , that 's not enough			0
in 2009 , flamboyant archeologist @entity209 of @entity196 and his colleagues began a new search for @entity194 's tomb -- " in hopes of removing some of the great mystery that hangs thick around this famous queen , " @entity209 wrote in @entity216			1
" many have searched for the tomb of @entity219 , but no one had searched for that missing piece of ancient @entity196 's story -- the tomb of @entity194 , who took her own life rather than surrender her homeland to the @entity227 , " @entity209 wrote			0
" it occurred to me that we had before us an opportunity to recover the last page in the book of ancient @entity196 civilization , an opportunity we could not pass by			0
" so far , he 's had no luck			0
then again , no one has found the tomb of @entity219 , either			1
@entity238 many ships , planes and people have disappeared in the @entity238 , a section of the @entity52 in a " triangle " marked by the points of @entity238 , @entity245 and @entity246 , @entity247			0
speculation runs wild on what caused the boats and aircraft to vanish			0
sound familiar ? the disappearance of flight 370 has nothing on the @entity238			0
some even blame the triangle disasters on supernatural forces , including influences from lost @entity142 or another time - space dimension			0
the @entity128 government devotes a web page to the @entity238 and rebuts fringe theories			0
@entity128 officials cite hurricanes , sudden storms , the powerful @entity265 and shallow @entity267 waters as reasonable explanations for the lost vessels			0
" the @entity270 and @entity271 contend that there are no supernatural explanations for disasters at sea			0
their experience suggests that the combined forces of nature and human fallibility outdo even the most incredulous science fiction , " the @entity128 @entity276 says on its website			0
" the ocean has always been a mysterious place to humans , and when foul weather or poor navigation is involved , it can be a very deadly place			1
this is true all over the world			0
" by the way , no official mapping exists for triangle 's boundaries , @entity276 says			0
life out there call them aliens			0
call them what you want			0
but let 's face it : do n't we all wonder what 's out there , especially when we launch spacecraft to another planet ? sure , astronomers study the heavens and find new planets , but what we 're privately searching for is whether we are alone			0
among the organizations advancing this pursuit is the @entity318 for the @entity319 , named after the late @entity128 astronomer who championed exploration of the cosmos			0
" the significance of a finding that there are other beings who share this universe with us would be absolutely phenomenal , it would be an epochal event in human history , " @entity323 once declared .			0

the hunt for @entity2 *conjures* up other great searches by mankind
the @entity14 , never found , is a metaphor for all monumental quests
the ocean searches for the @entity44 , @entity66 447 ended with success
is our greatest search the one to know whether we are alone ?
