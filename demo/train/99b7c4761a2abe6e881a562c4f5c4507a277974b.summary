-- a @entity2 - based commercial pilot says the @entity3 retaliated against him after he posted videos online showing what he described as shortcomings in airport security			1
the series of videos showed scenes from inside the @entity10 and were narrated by the pilot , who pointed out the contrast between the passengers who were heavily scrutinized , while a single door separated employees who worked on the airfield from the airport			1
" i was trying to bring up the obvious , ludicrous @entity3 - type of security , " the pilot said , referring to the cell phone videos he posted , and later removed , from the popular video - sharing website @entity20			1
the pilot requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue			0
he said he did n't think much about posting his videos online in late november , but that within a matter of days , his chief pilot called him to ask him to remove the videos because they were " stirring a commotion			1
" a few days after that , the pilot was informed by the @entity3 that he was being suspended from a program in which he participated , the @entity34 program			1
as an officer in the program , he was deputized by @entity3 to carry a handgun in the cockpit			2
" basically , an air marshal in the sky , " the pilot said of the volunteer program			0
after his suspension , four air marshals and two local deputies showed up at his home near @entity46 , @entity2 , to personally confiscate his weapon			0
the only answer he could get from the @entity3 as to why he was suspended from the program was that he may have violated a regulation , he said			1
the @entity3 said that it holds those serving as federal flight deck officers to " the highest ethical standards , " and said it took action because the pilot was in the program			1
" @entity59 must be able to maintain sensitive security information as a condition of the @entity34 program , " @entity3 spokeswoman @entity58 said			1
" as the issuing authority of credentials and firearms , @entity3 reviews each possible violation of those standards and acts accordingly up to and including removing an individual from the assigned role			0
" @entity58 also defended security measures at the @entity10 airport , saying that there are " measures in place that are both seen and unseen			1
" in the aftermath of the incident , the pilot said he resigned from the program			0
in the age of @entity81 , where divulging sensitive information can be so controversial , why did this pilot decide to share his videos so publicly ? " i did n't think anything would come of it , " said the 50 - year - old pilot , a veteran who was a maintenance test pilot			2
" this is really about getting the message out and demanding intelligent security , " @entity88 , the pilot 's attorney , said			0
" no state secrets are being shown here			0
what 's being shown here is a lack of security			0
" beyond the @entity3 action , the pilot 's airline had not taken any action against him , and he counts on the support of his union			2
however , when the sheriff 's deputies showed up at his house with the air marshals , they also took his @entity2 concealed weapons permit			0
the pilot said this permit was unrelated to his work for the @entity3			2
@entity0 's @entity112 contributed to this report .			0

" i was trying to bring up the obvious , ludicrous @entity3 - type of security , " the pilot says
