-- @entity1 have booked their place in the semifinals of the @entity5 with an emphatic 10 - wicket win over @entity7 in @entity8			1
openers @entity9 and @entity11 both made centuries as they overcame @entity7 's total of 229 for six with more than 10 overs to spare			1
earlier , @entity7 won the toss and elected to bat and got off to a steady start as @entity18 joined captain @entity19 at the top of the order			2
but both were out in quick succession			0
@entity19 bowled by @entity9 for five with the score on 29 , while @entity18 fell two runs later for 25 , caught by @entity26 off the bowling of @entity28			2
@entity29 and @entity30 put on 64 for the third wicket , but by the time @entity30 was trapped lbw by @entity32 for 31 in the 27th over @entity7 had only made 95 runs			0
@entity35 hurried things along a little scoring a brisk half century , but when he fell with the score on 186 any momentum that had been gained quickly dissipated			0
@entity29 battled on until the penultimate over of the innings scoring 86 from 115 balls before becoming @entity32 's second victim			0
@entity45 shock @entity43 @entity46 tried to swing the willow at the death but could only muster one boundary in the final over -- @entity7 only scored 12 fours in the entire innings -- to give @entity7 a score of 229 , and an outside chance of victory			1
but any hopes they might have harbored were quickly snuffed out as @entity1 took total control of the match			2
none of @entity7 's six bowlers ever really troubled @entity9 or @entity11 and the game progressed to a predictable and rather anti-climactic conclusion			1
afterwards , @entity7 captain , @entity19 conceded his team 's total was always going to be difficult to defend			1
" i think we were 30 light and at the end it felt like 50 light			0
i thought if we took early wickets we 'd be in with a chance but fair play to @entity1 , the opening batsmen were outstanding , " @entity19 said			0
@entity1 's victory sets up a meeting with @entity45 next tuesday for a place in the final which takes place in @entity81 on april 2 .			1
