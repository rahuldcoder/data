-- if you 're taking a strict view on the world 's most bike - friendly cities , the eventual list would mainly take in a smallish patch of northwest @entity7			1
one such rating table , produced by the @entity10 - based cycling advocacy group @entity11 , has more than half its top 20 bike - friendly places clustered around the @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity10			1
instead , we 'll spread our net more widely , rewarding aspiration , ambition and progress , as well as just endless ranks of smiling cyclists pedaling sensible bikes on segregated paths			0
@entity25 , @entity13 lists such as this one traditionally begin with @entity27 , but while the @entity13 ' most populous city is definitely bike friendly , we 're marking it down for the hordes of wobbling tourists on bright - red rental machines			1
instead we 're heading southeast to @entity25 , a city that has a fair claim to being the globe 's most pro-two - wheel destination			1
in its center , up to 50 % of all journeys take place in the saddle and local authorities are building a 12,500 - space cycle parking facility billed as the world 's biggest			1
as in all @entity13 cities , visitors from places with a more belligerent traffic culture might be struck at how normal it all feels			1
cycling in @entity25 is treated on par with walking , with helmets and high - visibility garments rarely used , not least because of the protection offered by segregated cycle lanes			1
one well known @entity56 cycle blogger , @entity57 , was struck by the range in ages on a visit to @entity25			1
" i find it hard to imagine children this young cycling into the center of any @entity66 city at all , let alone cycling in and looking so happy and relaxed , and so ordinary , " he writes			2
" yet in @entity25 , families cycling around together is commonplace			1
" @entity69 , @entity70 @entity69 is the answer to those who say promoting urban bike use is too ambitious and takes decades			2
in 2006 , the @entity77 capital 's government , vexed by the city 's four daily rush hours ( yes , four ! this is siesta - taking southern @entity70 ) decided to take action			1
there was plenty of naysaying			0
critics pointed out @entity70 has scant tradition of commuter cycling			0
some questioned who would ride in midsummer through @entity7 's hottest regions and risk arriving at work as damp as if they 'd just pedaled through a mechanical car wash			2
undaunted , the city established about 50 miles of cycle lanes within a year ( there 's now about 80 miles ) and commissioned a municipal bike rental plan called @entity97			1
the result ? within about six years , journeys made by bike shot from less than 0.5 % to about 7 % , and city transportation chiefs from around the world suddenly had the perfect excuse to arrange week - long fact - finding trips in the sun. @entity106 by long tradition one of the few @entity109 cities in these sort of lists , @entity106 began constructing bike paths in the 1980s and now has almost 400 miles of them			1
the addition of its popular and pioneering @entity118 municipal bike - share plan , the model for those later rolled out in @entity119 and @entity120 , has meant a remarkable amount of cycle use , especially for a place where daytime winter temperature above 10 @entity125 ) is viewed as dangerously tropical			2
cycling stats for @entity106 indicate the city still has work to do and cycle groups say too many riders are nudged onto busy roads			2
one survey says nearly half the city 's adult population rides a bike at least once a week , yet little more than 2 % of commutes are made on two wheels			1
" the challenge is that we have asked people to start using their bicycles and they 've done it so much faster than we 've been able to change the city , " @entity138 , the person in charge of mass transit on @entity106 's executive committee , told the @entity142 recently			2
@entity149 , @entity10 much like ignoring @entity14 on a roster of great cheese countries , a list of top cycling cities excluding @entity149 just would n't be right			0
more than half the locals in the @entity10 capital cycle to work or school , and with an estimated bike population of 650,000 there are slightly more cycles than people			0
enough of these are available to rent to tourists , and @entity149 's compact dimensions and tolerant traffic make it perfect to explore by bike			1
city leaders are intent not just on increasing bike use further , but exporting the @entity149 doctrine of a segregated and safe bike infrastructure that features bike lanes of up to three meters ( about 10 feet ) in width			2
there 's an official @entity174 of @entity10 to spread the word , while the founder of the aforementioned @entity178 group , @entity179 , spends much of his working life telling other cities how to copy the @entity10 model			0
@entity183 @entity184 shouted about than the @entity13 or @entity10 examples , @entity15 has nonetheless been quietly getting on with boosting bike use in many of its cities			1
@entity183 is the standout example			0
about 13 % of all trips in the city are made by bike , nearly twice the rate of 20 years ago			1
in some inner suburbs this hits 20 %			0
this is particularly impressive given the city 's long , freezing winters , abundant public transport and status as capital of a nation with a long tradition of manufacturing cars and driving them at absurd speeds on autobahns			1
aside from clever and consistent public policy designed to boost bike use , @entity183 has a number of inbuilt advantages			0
streets are often hugely wide , in part a consequence of the devastation of @entity216 and grandiose postwar @entity218 planning , and the terrain is largely flat			0
while many @entity223 live in apartments , often a difficulty for those using bikes , the city 's traditional @entity221 tenement blocks tend to be built around a central courtyard , giving space for secure storage			1
what 's most impressive is the sheer scale -- @entity183 has a population of about 3.5 million people , far bigger than the relatively small likes of @entity27 and @entity149			0
@entity236 , @entity237 " the groundwork for the city 's bike infrastructure was laid over 20 years ago , " says @entity238 , bike manager of @entity236 's @entity239			1
" it has built upon itself over the years and bicycling has become somewhat ingrained in the culture of the city			0
" in some ways , @entity236 now has the feel of a @entity7 city			0
" that infrastructure includes more than 65 miles of bike paths , 30 miles of low - traffic bike boulevards and 175 miles of bike lanes , all of which are used with gusto by the 8 % of citizens who claim that biking is their primary form of transportation , and 10 % who say a bike is their secondary vehicle			1
all of those numbers are climbing annually , thanks to the city 's grand @entity268 for 2030 , unanimously adopted by the @entity270 in 2010			1
the plan calls for attracting new riders by forming a denser bike network , reducing vehicle speed limits on designated streets ( thus increasing safety for riders ) and increasing bicycle parking , among other measures			1
the most exciting development for @entity236 bikers is the planned 2015 opening of the @entity283 , @entity283 spanning the @entity284 , which divides the east and west sides of the city			0
the first span built over the river since 1973 , " the bridge will be distinctive in the @entity288 , designed to carry light rail trains , buses , cyclists , pedestrians and streetcars , but not private vehicles , " according to @entity297 , the local public agency that operates mass transit			0
the bridge will feature two 14 - foot - wide pedestrian and bike lanes			2
according to the @entity302 , an estimated 2,100 races , rides and other biking events are held in @entity236 each year			0
@entity306 wait , @entity306 ? the one with more than 13 million inhabitants covering 800 - plus square miles			2
in this vast , crammed capital city , an amazing 14 % of all trips are made by bike			1
there are practical reasons many @entity306 residents prefer a bike to a car for shorter journeys			1
before you can even buy a car in the city you must prove you possess a ( rare and usually expensive ) off - street parking spot			2
few people cycle to work -- distances tend to be long and the mass transit system is hugely efficient			0
instead , rides tend to be around the countless neighborhoods that make up the city			0
also , a lot of cycling takes place -- legally -- on footpaths and sidewalks			0
these are n't the @entity338 - clad speedsters of @entity120 or @entity339			0
@entity306 cyclists use practical " mamachari " bikes with sturdy frames , baskets for shopping and seats containing one or two small children			2
they pedal about the pavement on these weighty behemoths , rarely reaching the pace of a jog , keeping out of the way of each other and pedestrians with ample use of the so - called " gaman " attitude , a sort of stoic tolerance for others which makes life in such a vast , packed city more or less work			0
@entity363 , @entity364 call this one an honorable mention			2
@entity364 's capital is by no means as obviously cycle - friendly as others on this list , with fewer than 5 % of @entity363 's journeys involving bikes , increasing car numbers and choking smog			1
nonetheless , it merits its place for effort , not least for tempting so many citizens of an often deprived and hugely packed city -- the population is fast nearing 9 million -- onto two wheels			0
did we mention it 's located 2,600 meters ( 8,500 feet ) above sea level ? anyone thinking of pedaling around as a tourist should be prepared for some undignified wheezing the first day or so			0
credit is due to the city 's former mayor , @entity387 , who on taking office in 1998 canceled a planned highway through the city center and kick - started a process that 's seen @entity363 acquire nearly 200 miles of protected bike lanes and , soon , its own bike - rental plan			1
the best way to try two - wheeled life in @entity363 is a weekly sunday ritual known as @entity398 that sees 70 miles of streets closed to vehicles and given over to bikes and pedestrians			2
@entity403 is a journalist based in the @entity66 who regularly contributes to cycling publications			0
he once rode a bike most of the way from @entity407 to @entity120			0
@entity0 's series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries and regions we profile			0
however @entity0 retains full editorial control over all of its reports			0

@entity13 city of @entity25 is building the world 's biggest bike parking facility
@entity363 may be cursed by smog and heavy traffic , but the city 's mayor is credited with *dramatically* boosting bike use
in @entity306 , nearly 14 % of all journeys are made by bicycle
