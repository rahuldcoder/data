@entity0 -- a @entity0 street cleaners strike that has left trash piling up for two weeks appears headed for a pivotal point on saturday , when city hall aims to enforce minimum trash pickup services by using national -- not municipal -- workers , city and union representatives said			1
pressure has been building on mayor @entity11 from hotel and shop owners , who have been outspoken in saying the strike is hurting the city 's image and their businesses , and from neighborhood associations who complain that trash and broken glass are littering the streets			1
the human cost of @entity25 's financial crisis about the only respite for the @entity25 capital has been that workers who pick up garbage from homes and restaurants are not on strike			2
but the street cleaners are very much on strike , so that trash receptacles on the street are overflowing , especially the large bins for glass and paper recycling			1
and the autumn leaves are n't being swept up either			0
@entity41 businessman @entity40 was visiting the emblematic plaza mayor this week and told @entity1 , " it 's impossible not to notice it			1
the city looks absolutely dirty			1
" his wife , @entity46 , added , " it looks horrible ... everywhere you walk			0
" there are concerns about potential health hazards			0
the city says it has not reached that point but is monitoring the situation closely			0
six thousand street and parks cleaners went on strike on november 5 , after three large private services companies that share the city concession for street cleaning announced 1,134 job cuts -- an 18 % reduction of the workforce -- and threatened salary reductions for those remaining			1
mayor @entity11 initially said that since these services are outsourced , it was up to those companies and the workers ' unions to resolve the issue			0
minimum services were stipulated : that 40 % of the normal cleanup would occur on the streets , and 25 % in the parks			0
but that 's not happening , and the few cleaning crews that are working -- in the city 's main tourist areas -- do so under police protection			2
companies blame union pickets for the lack of minimum services but the unions blame the companies			0
@entity25 turning back the clock on siestas " the situation will get worse if the strike continues , " the @entity0 shop owners association said in a prepared statement , " because we 're just ahead of the @entity97 holidays , a sales period that is vital for stores			1
" on november 13 , @entity11 announced a 48 - hour deadline , warning that minimum services would have to be carried out or the city would impose them , using workers from a company that 's part of the national @entity107			2
but unions representing the @entity110 cleaning workers , from a company called @entity112 , issued a statement saying they would n't comply because they also are facing sharp job cuts			2
@entity25 's unemployment rate climbs to record high the street cleaners strike is another example of how hard it is for @entity25 to get out of its long economic crisis			1
many @entity25 cities , like @entity0 , are in debt and have outsourced services , trying to cut costs			2
and the companies with the concessions say that , for efficiency 's sake , they need to hold workers ' costs in line			0
the unions for @entity0 's street cleaners vow to stand firm and said city hall 's attempt to use a national workforce for minimum services could lead to " disagreeable scenes " confronting workers against workers , said @entity143 , of the @entity144			1
the unions vow to stand firm , but acknowledge that saturday is also the deadline when negotiations expire on the strike issues			0
it means , @entity150 said , that the companies could begin to carry out all 1,134 job cuts , even though in negotiations the two sides had discussed formulas to reduce the cuts to around 600 jobs in exchange for other concessions from the remaining workers			1
there was no agreement on that formula either			0
and the trash keeps piling up .			0

hotel , shop owners calling for *intervention* in @entity0 street cleaners strike
the city may call in national workers to do the job municipal workers have not
@entity41 businessman : " it 's very sad . the city looks absolutely dirty "
the strike *erupted* after word of 1,134 jobs cuts , with salary reductions for those remaining
