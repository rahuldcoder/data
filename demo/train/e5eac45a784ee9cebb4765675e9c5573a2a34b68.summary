@entity0 -- @entity2 acting like @entity3			1
the 2016 presidential contest is shaping up to be the political equivalent of gender - bending			2
@entity2 are coalescing early around a front - runner who certainly will be lavishly funded , @entity8			1
she 's campaigning on the familiar @entity3 platform : " next in line			2
" meanwhile , a twice - beaten @entity3 finds itself doing as @entity2 often did in the @entity14 era , surveying a field of little - knowns and hoping for magic			1
the @entity3 field is led by two freshman senators : @entity20 of @entity21 and @entity22 of @entity23 , plus a member of the @entity25 and the party 's 2012 vice presidential nominee , @entity28			1
three things are immediately striking about the top of the @entity3 field : 1 ) it 's not only @entity0 - based , but it 's all congressionally based			1
there is no governor in the top three , no general , no former cabinet secretary , nobody with any notable private - sector accomplishment			0
2 ) it 's light on accomplishment			0
@entity28 has to date been the most productive of the top three , but none of his famous budgets have been passed into law			0
@entity20 can cite no legislative accomplishments at all , only a stunt filibuster against the entirely imaginary menace of drone strikes against @entity48 citizens on @entity48 soil			2
@entity22 has taken a lead role in immigration reform but must make some tough decisions about whether his future is best secured by negotiating a deal or scuttling one			2
none of the three @entity3 front - runners has any administrative experience to speak of			1
3 ) it 's intensely doctrinaire			0
@entity28 was the author of much of the @entity3 's post- 2009 tea party program			1
@entity22 has to date shown himself an undeviating follower of that program			0
@entity20 dissents from some aspects of that program but in the direction of even greater extremism			0
a party rebuilding from back - to - back presidential defeats has to face the possibility that the problem may be bigger than its candidate , bigger than its campaign tactics			1
there are a couple of obvious ways to address that possibility : the party might look for an outsider nominee , a candidate so attractive in his or her own right as to offset the party 's own unpopularity			0
this is what @entity3 did by nominating @entity84 in 1952 after five consecutive defeats by @entity86 @entity2			0
or the party might allow an insider some latitude to edge back toward the political center			0
this is what @entity2 did in 1992 when they nominated a pro-death penalty , pro-welfare reform , pro-free trade governor of @entity94 after losses under the party - line liberals , @entity97 and @entity98			2
in 2016 , however , @entity3 as yet show no inclination to try either remedy			2
no independent superstar ; no deviation from party line orthodoxy			0
the one @entity3 with the highest cross-partisan appeal , @entity106 gov. @entity105 , has been consigned to fourth place			1
as the saying goes , the first step toward recovery is to acknowledge the problem			0
the problem in 2012 -- as in 2008 , as in the near - death experience of 2004 , as in the popular vote loss of 2000 , as in the loss of 1996 , as in the loss of 1992 -- was the @entity3 's failure to offer an economic program relevant to the problems of middle - class @entity48			1
the party 's present three front - runners would not only repeat that failure , but double down on that failure			1
the @entity3 desperately needs renewal , its early presidential front - runners are characterized by their rejection of change			1
at a time when voters reject generic @entity132 , @entity3 themselves are rallying to two of the most generic @entity3 in the party -- and a third , @entity20 , who diverges from generic @entity132 only by offering voters even more of what they most dislike about today 's @entity3			1
the party talks about learning from its mistakes			0
thus far , the main thing the party seems to have learned from those mistakes is how to repeat them			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity143 .			0

@entity143 : *democrats* could pick 2008 also - ran @entity8 for 2016
he says @entity3 front - runners seem unlikely to measure up
despite losses , @entity3 could pick long shots such as @entity22 or @entity20 , he says
@entity153 : one candidate who appeals across party lines is @entity105
