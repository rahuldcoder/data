he is very frustrated and apparently now a bit nauseous			0
the " liberal elite " media are getting under his skin with their incessant questions about his views on social issues such as same - sex marriage , abortion and birth control			1
( @entity1 's opposition to birth control seems a bit disingenuous since he loves to wear a sweater vest -- which i view as a form of birth control			2
) this frustration was bad enough , but his emotional state recently took a turn for the worse			0
on sunday , @entity1 reiterated that he " almost threw up " after reading @entity24 's famous 1960 speech that declared a president 's religious views were private and should not be " imposed by him upon the nation			1
" it appears that @entity1 is an irritated , woozy wreck of a presidential candidate			2
maybe that is why this week he requested @entity34 protection			0
( my question is : who is going to protect us from @entity1 ? ) the joking and nausea aside , i ca n't comprehend how @entity1 could be distraught when the media inquire about topics he raised ? is he confused about how this whole running for president thing works ? or does he not understand the words coming out of his mouth ? @entity1 was so distressed by the " liberal " media that he took off time from campaigning last week in @entity47 and @entity48 and headed to @entity49 seeking refuge with the least liberal elitist media person he could find : @entity52			1
there , @entity52 and @entity1 sat on couches directly across from each other , making it look less like a political interview and more like a session with " dr. @entity59 " it was n't long before @entity1 opened up to " dr. @entity52 " about his feelings regarding the " bad " media : " they ask the question , ' why are you always talking about contraception ? ' i said , ' because that 's all you want to ask me about			1
' i mean , it is frustrating			0
... you can get a little frustrated			0
" i was hoping @entity52 would offer @entity1 one of @entity59 's famed lines of advice such as : " no dog ever peed on a moving car			2
" despite all @entity1 's talk that our nation 's and @entity80 's laws must agree and that biblical truths are the basis for his views on social issues such as same - sex marriage , he assured us during last week 's @entity0 debate in @entity48 that he does not intend to transform his religious beliefs into public policy : " just because i 'm talking about it does n't mean i want a government program to fix it			1
" sorry , you ca n't have it both ways			0
you ca n't try to win conservative voters by telling them that the @entity95 -- not our @entity96 -- is the standard our laws must agree with and then try to assure mainstream @entity99 that you do n't mean it			2
in the words of @entity59 : " that dog do n't hunt			0
" @entity1 needs to come clean with the @entity99 people			0
is his allegiance to the @entity95 or the @entity96 ? will he publicly recognize there is a separation of church and state in @entity99 ? does he believe the @entity99 does not have an official religion ? @entity24 -- a @entity108 like @entity1 -- was dogged by these same issues when he was running for president			1
@entity24 addressed this matter head - on in that 1960 speech to a group of @entity115 ministers : " i am the @entity116 's candidate for president who happens also to be a @entity108			1
... i believe in an @entity99 where the separation of church and state is absolute			2
" to say @entity1 is no @entity24 is too easy			1
it 's like comparing @entity121 to the @entity122			0
but @entity1 has a chance to follow @entity24 's example despite his feeling that the 35th president 's sentiments in that speech almost made him want to " throw up			1
" to be honest , however , even if @entity1 would make such a speech , it would be more challenging for him to put this issue behind him than it was for @entity24			1
after all , it was not @entity24 who raised these issues but his opponents , who claimed that he would be more loyal to the pope and @entity108 law than the @entity96			1
in contrast , @entity1 intentionally made these subjects a central theme in his campaign , often sounding less like a person running to be the leader of a democratic nation and more like someone seeking the position of pastor or the leader of a province in @entity152			2
i believe most @entity99 -- including myself -- suspect that a president 's faith could color his decisions on some @entity157 but i hope that most @entity99 would , too , agree that a president 's religious beliefs should be subservient to our @entity96			1
even @entity161 stated clearly that : " @entity162 are , and must remain , separate			0
" we now need to hear that from @entity1			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity167 .			0

@entity167 : @entity1 annoyed the media ask for his stance on social issues
@entity167 : but does n't he get how running for president works if he raises those issues ?
@entity1 says he almost threw up at @entity24 's stand on separation of church and state
@entity167 : @entity1 must clarify he will not put religion over @entity96
