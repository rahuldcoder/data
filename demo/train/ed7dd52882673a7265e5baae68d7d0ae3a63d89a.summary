-- dear cicada friends , we know you probably do n't speak @entity4 , but we humans ca n't really buzz that well , so this letter will have to do			1
the last time we saw your cicada variety , known as @entity8 , emerge was in 1996			1
other broods have come and gone since then , but we 're still glad to see you			2
you were still in your larval stage in ' 96 , so you probably do n't remember			2
now , you 're rising to the surface and having a grand ol ' party			2
so much so that @entity0 is tracking readers ' reports of your locations and listening to recordings of your buzz			0
we humans have a hard time imagining what it must be like to go into hiding for years on end and leave your fate in the hands of the world			1
who knows what the world will be like when you next emerge 17 years from now ? will it be a mundane place or a strange post-apocalyptic scene ? that 's why we 're so in awe of you			1
you are like living time capsules , and you take it in stride			0
life is one big , buzzing party for you			0
@entity37 : see where readers are finding cicadas but all good things must come to an end , and before you go , we 'd like to bring you up to speed on the things you 've missed since you were last here			1
it 's probably not pleasant to think about , but we want to reach you in time			1
we were inspired to write you this letter because of a heartfelt @entity48 we received from @entity49 of @entity50 , @entity51			1
she talked about many events that have happened in the past 17 years			1
like your species , her family has hatched a new generation of offspring during this time			0
your buggy brains are n't really geared for philosophy , but here 's a grub of an idea : the tragedy of your lives is a metaphor for our own			1
it 's too bad you barely missed @entity72 's " @entity71 , " with @entity68 and @entity69 in the leading roles			1
it came out in fall 1996 -- well after you would have ducked into the ground			1
and do n't forget about " @entity75 , " which also came out around that time			0
bet you would have related to @entity77 's infamous star - crossed lovers , who were destined to shack up and then die while still in their teens			1
we think you would also have a special appreciation for the " @entity85 " movie trilogy , which kicked off in 1997			0
it features a @entity88 spy who is cryogenically frozen in the 1960s and then emerges in the 1990s with a strong mating instinct			0
@entity91 away the bad teeth and @entity94 decor , and your stories are much the same			0
read about cicada life cycles and other broods culture shock was a big part of the " @entity101 " films , and you 're probably feeling like a @entity103 as well			1
surely you must be wondering where you can get some pogs , or the latest dramatic twists and turns in the @entity108 line - up			1
@entity109 released several acclaimed albums ( including " @entity111 " and " @entity112 " ) as well			0
@entity114 , there was even a @entity116 anniversary concert in 1999			0
a few years later , an electronic band called @entity118 formed in the @entity88			1
their self - titled debut album ( 2006 ) will make your feelers twitch			1
it includes a song called " @entity118 " that intermingles rhythmic buggy noises with sweet synthetic sounds			0
you skipped most of the boy / girl bands -- just barely			0
the @entity128 put out their self - titled album in june 1996 and * @entity130 rose soon thereafter			1
the @entity131 released their debut album " spice " worldwide by 1997 , and @entity133 reached stardom status in the late 1990s			0
the @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 ... there 's so many			1
the brothers @entity142 mmmbopped their way onto the charts in 1997 when they were just nymphs			0
they continued to put out albums after they finished molting , and now generate almost as much buzz as you do -- and have produced nearly as many larvae			0
oh , and we almost forgot to mention " @entity150 " ! there are now three prequels to come before the first " @entity150 " ( that was really @entity154 ) , and there 's this character called @entity157 and ... never mind			2
you 've had to digest so much already			0
if you 're still unsure about what happened in the 1990s , @entity159 is totally on it			0
any relation ? they 're about as cicada - like as humans get , constantly searching for whatever happens to be buzzing at any given time			1
the writers are in their laboratories concocting nostalgia for the 2000s as we speak			0
but we do n't want to bug you with too much popular culture			0
there 's also plenty of serious history that you 've missed			1
we 've been through five presidential elections now , and three presidents			0
the truth is , maybe you 're better off not having seen footage of the september 11 terror attacks , or the wars that began afterward			0
you also conveniently missed the biggest burst of the housing bubble , or running the risk of getting laid off during the @entity185			2
you ca n't bring most liquids through airport security anymore , and the @entity190 space shuttle program as we knew it has ended			0
in 1999 , the technology world fretted over the @entity194 bug , in which a date - formatting issue threatened to bring down computer programs everywhere			2
concerns about serious problems seemed largely unfounded when 2000 finally rolled around			0
cicadas should also be aware that the " @entity201 " was released by @entity200 in 1998 , which in turn renewed humans ' desire to drive a bug			2
in the world of devices , the @entity207 device is still consumed in its addictive @entity207 form , but plenty of two - leggers are using smartphones and tablets with touchscreens			2
( you do n't have hands , so you might need a keyboard that you can tap with your legs			0
) you fast - forwarded through the meteoric rise of the @entity220 , and the spider - like reach of social media			2
you missed complaining about several @entity225 layout iterations and being friends with that guy named @entity228 on @entity229 in the 2000s			2
you can still be friends with him now , but it 's just not the same			2
the predictable backlash toward spending too much time online works to your advantage , because you 're well - equipped for it			2
you spend just about all your time in the out - of - doors , happily buzzing away and doing your thing until your time comes			2
dying cicadas spotted in @entity244 you 're probably not worried about all these things that bipeds are always fussing about , but we just thought we 'd let you know			1
maybe there 's a few things we 're missing out on , as well			1
if there 's any consolation , it 's that other broods will return in the coming years , albeit in varying places and at different intervals			1
@entity257 , @entity258 , you name it			0
but there 's only one @entity8 until we meet again with your descendants 17 years from now , let 's all say goodbye and farewell			1
buzzing off , the people of @entity267 " bzzz zzzzz zzzzzz zzzz bzzzzz bzz " what would you add to this letter ? are there any important events that stand out to you ? share your thoughts in the comments area below			1
follow @ @entity275 on @entity276 for more science news			0
