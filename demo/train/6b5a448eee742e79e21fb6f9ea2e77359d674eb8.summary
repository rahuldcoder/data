-- i was six months pregnant when a smiling stranger on a bus asked where i was delivering			2
within minutes , this woman was sharing intimate details of her own birthing experience -- the water breaking , the contractions that failed to get closer together , and the way her doctor deftly sewed up the four - inch incision from her caesarean section			2
" i 'm telling you , this guy was good , " she said			0
" next time , i 'm just scheduling my c - section			1
none of this pushing stuff			0
" i reached my stop before i could probe her for more specifics			0
but , i have to admit , her ringing endorsement made c - sections seem pretty appealing			1
after all , for most of us , the thought of pushing a baby through a centimeters - wide opening is at least daunting , if not downright terrifying			0
and , the fact is , a c - section is so routine these days that many regard it as simply an alternative to vaginal delivery , not major abdominal surgery			1
except that 's exactly what it is			0
and today , one in three babies is born via c - section , according to the most recent data -- a 50 percent increase over the previous decade			1
" we think the rate is going to go up even more , " says @entity43 , @entity44 , associate professor of obstetrics , gynecology , and reproductive biology at @entity48 in @entity49 , @entity50			0
when the procedure is needed -- when the mother or baby is in distress or other factors make a vaginal delivery hazardous -- it can be a lifesaver			2
but only about 5 percent of c - sections are true emergencies , estimates @entity63 , @entity44 , chairman of the depart Â­ ment of obstetrics and gynecology at the @entity68 in @entity69 , in @entity70			1
around 3 percent are completely elective , meaning there 's no medical reason whatsoever , but the vast majority of c - sections actually fall into a gray zone : the baby looks big , mom is past her due date , labor is n't progressing well			1
a growing number of critics are now questioning whether so many of these healthy pregnancies should end with surgery			0
" there 's no question that there 's a basic , irreducible number of c - sections we need to do for women 's health , " @entity43 says			1
" but there 's also no question that we 're doing too many in the @entity95			2
" @entity0 : how to sooth heartburn during pregnancy it takes at least four weeks to recover from a caesarean section -- which involves cutting through the skin , tissue , and uterine wall , extracting the baby and placenta , and sewing the incision -- compared with one or two weeks for vaginal deliveries			1
the surgery carries with it the risk of infection , blood loss , and blood clots , as well as other potentially fatal complications			0
while we 've all heard that type a moms and profit - seeking doctors are fueling this trend , the truth is far more complex			2
here 's the real story , and what every woman needs to know before she gets pregnant			0
why c - sections are so hot reason # 1 : better technology is picking up more potential problems from third - trimester ultrasounds that predict the size of the baby to monitors that check the baby 's heart rate during labor and delivery , obstetricians and hospitals rely on technology more than ever to flag potential problems during pregnancy , labor , and delivery			1
if there 's a hint of trouble , they 're more likely to play it safe and do a @entity140 , @entity63 says			0
" continuous recording of the fetal heart rate came into being in the 1970s and is likely a big contributor to the increase in c - sections , " he says			1
" doctors today are more inclined to do a c - section if there is anything of concern			1
" @entity156 : the curious history in birth control reason # 2 : moms are older more women are waiting later to have children , and " c - sections increase with [ maternal ] age , " @entity63 says			1
older women have more medical problems that can complicate delivery , have a more difficult time pushing a baby out , and are more likely to ask for c - sections , he notes			1
@entity156 : is your fertility window closing ? on top of that , the fertility treatments that many older women use to get pregnant lead to more twins , triplets , etc. -- and multiples often demand a surgical delivery			2
" it 's very hard to predict how the second baby will come out , " says @entity183 , @entity44 , assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the @entity186 , noting that complicated positions are more common among multiples			0
plus , after a trial published in @entity191 in 2002 found that delivering a breech baby ( one whose head is up high and feet or butt are positioned to come out first ) by c - section is safer for the fetus , the surgery became the default method for delivering multiples , regardless of the position of the babies			1
reason # 3 : more of today 's moms - to - be are overweight pregnant women with body mass indexes of 30 or higher are more likely to require c - sections			1
and today , 34 percent of women over the age of 20 fit into this " clinically obese " category , compared with 26 percent a decade or so ago , according to the @entity211			2
" heavier women have bigger babies , " which are tougher to push out , @entity43 says			2
what 's more , too much fatty tissue can prevent the baby from moving smoothly through the birth canal and keep the body from absorbing medications designed to speed labor along			0
obese women also have more medical problems , like diabetes and high blood pressure , which might require induction of labor , setting them up for unwanted c - sections ( see below )			1
reason # 4 : more inductions mean more c - sections what 's the problem with inducing labor ? the process does n't always work as well as natural labor , so in those cases there 's a 35 to 50 percent chance that you 'll need a @entity140 , @entity183 estimates			1
inducing with drugs , manually stripping the membranes connecting the amniotic sac to the uterine walls , or rupturing the amniotic sac to cause contractions does n't always do the job			0
and with inductions at an all - time high , making up more than 22 percent of births , according to the @entity250 ( @entity250 ) , it follows that @entity140 have spiked , too			2
reason # 5 : one c - section leads to another once you have a c - section , doctors generally advise that you have one with subsequent deliveries			1
vaginal birth after a @entity140 ( @entity258 ) , which used to be widely available , is rarely performed these days , after a 1999 study showed a slight chance that the scar could give way , posing " a catastrophic risk to the mother and baby , " @entity43 says			0
around that time , @entity250 recommended that doctors perform @entity268 only in centers that can provide emergency c - sections , explains @entity271 , @entity44 , a fetal - medicine specialist at the @entity273 in @entity274 , @entity275			1
plus , there are liability concerns for doctors if a @entity258 goes wrong			0
@entity156 : the risks of having babies after 40 this trend may reverse itself , however			0
" multiple c - sections have risks as well , such as injury due to hardened scar tissue and a greater risk that [ in subsequent pregnancies ] the placenta will implant abnormally , " @entity63 says			1
in march , the @entity289 will re-evaluate whether @entity268 should be more widely available			0
are c - sections really riskier ? there 's really no way to 100 percent know which is a safer way to deliver			1
" unequivocally , i can state that the safest method is an uncomplicated vaginal delivery , " says @entity295 , @entity44 , chief of the pregnancy and perinatology branch of the @entity298 in @entity299 , @entity275			0
" that said , we do n't know who will wind up having an uncomplicated vaginal delivery			0
" @entity156 : the tricky business of scheduling a c - section @entity63 , who led a large study on @entity309 last year that found it was impossible to determine whether a vaginal delivery would be safe for women who had had a prior @entity140 , seconds @entity315 's assessment			1
" it is hard to get a great comparison of vaginal versus @entity140 , mainly because there are so many factors that go into the decision to have one or the other , " he explains			0
scientists have batted around the idea of conducting a study that would compare a planned vaginal birth with a planned c - section			1
but such a trial would have to control for all sorts of variables , and , even more daunting , @entity295 says , " you 'd need people who 'd be willing to have their birth method chosen for them randomly by a computer			0
" that , experts say , may not happen anytime soon			0
what every woman needs to know when a normal pregnancy takes a turn for the worse , few procedures work better or are easier for doctors to master than a c - section			1
and that has helped the in - case - of - emergency route become a safe route at the first sign of any trouble , says @entity347 , @entity44 , a general and endocrine surgeon at @entity49 's @entity348 and author of " @entity350 : a surgeon 's notes on performance			0
" @entity354 , a 34 - year - old literary agent in @entity355 , is grateful to have had a @entity140			0
when her doctor found that her baby had stopped growing three weeks before her due date , she delivered via c - section			1
" i just feel so lucky to live at a time when c - sections are relatively simple procedures , " says @entity354 , whose daughter @entity360 is now a healthy 2 - year - old			2
" i did n't care how she arrived in the world as long as she was safe			0
" @entity156 : fertility success rates in your 30s and 40s that 's what every mom - to - be wants : a healthy baby			0
so if you 're pregnant , schedule a conversation with your @entity372 and ask , " what 's your philosophy about c - sections ? " @entity183 advises			2
get your doctor 's opinion on what 's safe and within your control , because you may be asked to ok a gray - area c - section at the eleventh hour			2
the more informed you are , the better and safer delivery you 'll have -- whether it 's via caesarean section or not			2

one third of @entity95 babies are born via c - section -- a 50 percent jump over the previous decade
expert : 5 percent of c - sections are true emergencies ; 3 percent are *purely* elective
some health professionals believe the rate is still on the rise
older moms , heavier moms , fewer *vbacs* and more multiples are all factors
