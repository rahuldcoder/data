@entity0 , @entity1 -- at least one miner is fighting acute pneumonia , two will need dental surgery , and others have skin problems or lesions in their eyes			1
yet for all the 33 miners ' challenges the past 69 days , trapped a half - mile underground in the @entity17 mine without light , health care and other basics , those who have emerged appear surprisingly healthy , @entity1 's health minister said			1
" things are extraordinarily well , better than expected , " @entity21 said wednesday			1
" they really are in good condition -- emotional condition and physical condition			1
" after getting out of the capsule , each miner stood up and reconnected with loved ones			1
some of them engaged the throngs nearby			2
within minutes , though , all were placed on stretchers and whisked away to get medical care			2
while @entity21 said " no major problems " have been found , all the rescued miners will be carefully monitored at a nearby hospital in the coming hours and days			2
experts said some of the aftereffects of the long stay underground and quick trip to the surface -- especially mental effects , such as post-traumatic stress disorder or restless nights -- may be felt for years to come			1
the miners do not have to be flown to @entity47 , @entity21 said			2
however , officials strongly recommended it , and the miners have agreed to go , he said			2
many of the miners rescued by late wednesday afternoon had few evident medical problems , @entity21 said , and dizziness was not a problem because the rescue capsule did not rotate as much as officials feared			0
even so , all of the miners will be evaluated by specialists , including ophthalmologists , dermatologists and psychologists			0
they are being housed in a brand - new ward that was completed two months before the august 5 collapse at the @entity17 mine			1
the hospital has spent weeks preparing for the miners , said hospital director @entity68			0
" we 've been ready since @entity70 of this disaster , " he said last month			0
some miners may be released as early as thursday afternoon , @entity21 said , while others will stay longer at the hospital			0
that includes at least two men who need dental surgery and one miner , whom @entity21 would not identify , who is expected to remain hospitalized through the weekend			1
that miner 's symptoms emerged four days ago , and he was already being treated with antibiotics and improving about 24 hours before being brought to the surface , @entity21 said			1
besides physical maladies , in the coming days doctors will keep an eye out for nightmares , panic attacks , anxiety and claustrophobia , among other potential issues			1
they must be reintegrated with their families and society and deal with their sudden celebrity status and media attention			0
one expert has said the specter of post-traumatic stress disorder looms large			0
dr. @entity98 , the deputy chief medical officer at @entity99 in @entity100 , @entity101 , told @entity2 , " the work is just beginning when the miners get out of the mine			0
" if the miners are given a clean bill of health , they will be released to their families			1
some concerns linger due to their lack of sunlight , nutrition questions , the effects of their confinement , lack of sleep and sanitation issues			1
because they have been isolated for so long , they could be more susceptible to the common cold or other viruses			1
extensive precautions were taken to minimize health risks before the miners were rescued			1
two @entity126 nurses were sent down to the mine ahead of all the miners ' rescue to help them prepare for their trip to the surface , @entity21 said			0
one of them focused exclusively on the miner with pneumonia , who had an oxygen mask on his face when he came up			1
" they have an anemic condition , and right now they have been sleeping less these last few days , " @entity21 said earlier wednesday			0
" they 're tired and they still have long hours of waiting in order to be able to come up to the surface and to meet with their families			2
" the miners were switched to a liquid diet six hours before their rescue in case they vomit on the way up			0
because @entity1 mining minister @entity152 was concerned about the miners being reintroduced to sunlight abruptly , special sunglasses were sent down for the men to wear to make sure they do n't suffer damage to their retinas			1
while underground , they were given special clothing that pulls sweat away from the body because of concern about skin infections , as well as special socks to help prevent infections like athlete 's foot			2
they also had a series of vaccinations including a tetanus booster and flu shot			0
they have been exercising daily , and one miner , @entity174 , is a paramedic who has been weighing his colleagues daily and taking blood tests and daily urine samples			2
@entity180 astronaut @entity179 knows something about isolation and confinement			0
he says his five months in space aboard the @entity186 space station @entity187 left him weak and with bone loss			0
" down in the mines you have gravity pulling you down			0
there will be disorientation -- turning your head will feel like doing 100 backflips in a row , " he said			0
the miners that have come up are showing slight increases in blood pressure and cardiac activity during the trip , but they recovered satisfactorily after a few minutes of rest and have not required medication , @entity21 said			0
the health minister added later that , emotionally , he was surprised by how well the men were doing			1
still , experts warn that psychological adjustments may remain a hurdle for the miners			1
" these men spent 20 days totally cut off in the dark until the first bore hole was made , " @entity179 said			0
" so they were in survival mode , which is tough psychologically because you are in a life - and - death situation			2
" @entity2 's @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 and @entity219 contributed to this report .			0

one miner suffering from pneumonia , two need dental surgery
@entity1 health minister says things went " extraordinarily well "
experts warn of possible long - term effects from the ordeal
their psychological health is a concern as well as their physical health
