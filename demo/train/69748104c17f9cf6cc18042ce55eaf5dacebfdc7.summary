-- health care reform is proceeding toward the president 's desk , likely to become law in the new year			1
supporters promise the bill will cut costs and extend coverage			0
but here 's the real test : what will the trillion - dollar expense of this bill actually buy ? will it improve @entity16 's health ? my guess : no. for all the money @entity16 spend on health care ( 60 percent more per person than any other advanced country ) , @entity16 are not an especially healthy people			1
life expectancy at 50 in the @entity16 ranks 29th in the world , three years behind world leader @entity26 , one and a half years behind @entity29			1
other indicators -- infant mortality , life expectancy at birth -- look even worse			1
this poor performance is often blamed on the fact that millions of @entity16 lack health insurance			1
but as a recent paper for the @entity39 found , the @entity16 -- despite its kludgy health insurance system -- does a remarkably good job of extending disease - fighting treatment to all			1
authors @entity43 and @entity45 observe : the @entity16 screens a higher percentage of women for cervical cancer than any other country in a sample of 15 advanced countries			1
@entity16 have the highest survival rates for breast , lung , colon or rectal cancer in a sample of 20 advanced countries			1
compared with @entity59 , @entity29 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 , the @entity16 had the third - lowest fatality rate for male heart attack victims ages 40 - 64 , the second - lowest for men ages 85 - 89 and the best for women aged 85 - 89			2
@entity16 50 and older with heart disease are more likely to receive medication than similarly aged @entity71			2
cancer and heart disease are not any old ailments			0
these are the leading causes of death for people 50 and older			0
so if the @entity16 health system does such a good job saving its middle - aged and elderly sick , why do @entity16 die comparatively young ? answer : because @entity16 are much more likely to get sick in the first place			1
and that likelihood owes very little to the health care system and a great deal to the bad choices @entity16 individuals make			1
if you eat too much , exercise too little , drink too much , smoke , take drugs , fail to wear a seat belt or ignore gun safety , there is only so much a doctor or hospital can do for you			0
and @entity16 do all those things , more than other people			2
one - third of @entity16 are overweight			2
that one single fact accounts for almost 10 percent of all health care spending			0
at any given moment , one out of six motorists is unbelted			0
@entity16 children are nine times more likely to be injured in a gun accident than children in other developed countries			1
if all @entity16 quit smoking , if everybody wore a seat belt , if gun owners consistently secured their weapons , if we all drank in moderation and abjured illegal drugs and if the one - third of the country that is overweight would drop the extra pounds , those individual actions would do more to improve health and extend lives than any contemplated by @entity120 or the president			1
acting on this information wo n't be easy : it violates too many taboos			0
@entity16 understandably treasure their right to make their own choices , including the choice to super-size it			1
and many are uncomfortably aware that self - destructive behavior is most often found among the poor and among minorities : black women are more than three times as likely as white women to be severely obese			0
in the near term , public policy can achieve only a limited impact against these problems			0
there is evidence that youth obesity can be reduced by zoning rules that forbid fast - food restaurants to be sited within 200 yards of a school			0
more and better gym classes , better cafeteria menus and a ban on soda in schools would all help too			0
over the longer term , we will have to rethink the deeper structure of @entity16 food policy : subsidies to corn and soybean growers , the paving over of exurban land that might provide nearby cities with less expensive fruits and vegetables			2
ultimately , though , these are decisions that individuals must make for themselves			0
in this respect , the present concept of medicalized health care sends some unwelcome messages			0
by " outsourcing " the concept of health as something that doctors , hospitals and now government do for you -- rather than something that depends considerably on your own choices and efforts -- we ask the medical system to do more than any medical system can do			2
as you consider your new year 's resolutions , remember : better habits will benefit not only your family and yourself -- but all your neighbors and countrymen as well			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .			0

@entity16 ' poor health , relative to other countries , is cited as a reason for health reform
@entity191 says there 's little evidence health bill will improve @entity16 life expectancy
he says *research* shows *unhealthy* habits *explain* why @entity16 get sick more often
individual choices to adopt healthy *lifestyles* would have more impact , he says
