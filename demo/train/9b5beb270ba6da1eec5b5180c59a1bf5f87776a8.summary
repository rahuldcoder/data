-- a video surfaces threatening the @entity2			1
@entity4 's president vows the @entity5 will be safe			1
some @entity7 lawmakers warn that they wo n't be			1
one thing was clear as debate over the situation surged on sunday : security is a top concern , less than three weeks away from the competition			2
" it 's a very serious fear , " sen. @entity14 , @entity15 , told @entity0 's @entity16 sunday			0
@entity4 president @entity18 acknowledged that the @entity5 , like any high - profile event , could be a target for terrorists			1
but , he said , @entity4 has a " perfect understanding " of the threat and how to stop it			2
as a transcript of his interview with half a dozen national and international broadcasters was posted on the @entity30 website sunday , a video that surfaced online again highlighted the security situation			1
in the video , posted on a well - known @entity40 forum website , two young men believed to have been suicide bombers in last month 's back - to - back bombings in the @entity4 city of @entity37 speak of those attacks and make an ominous promise			1
" we 've prepared a present for you and all tourists who 'll come over , " the video says			2
" if you will hold the @entity2 , you 'll get a present from us for the @entity49 blood that 's been spilled			2
" attack on transit hub fuels concerns in the video , the men are dressed in black and standing in front of a black banner with religious verse that is typically associated with @entity59 - linked extremists			2
last month 's attacks in @entity37 , a major transit hub about 650 kilometers ( 400 miles ) away from @entity62 , sparked concerns over security as the @entity2 approach			1
the explosions targeted a train station and a trolley bus and claimed the lives of more than 30 people			0
in addition to the @entity37 attacks , there has also been violence in recent days in the southern republic of @entity76 -- the latest unrest linked to a long - running @entity79 insurgency in the @entity81 region			0
@entity18 pledges stepped up security @entity18 has pledged that visitors to @entity62 for the @entity2 will be kept safe			1
" we will try to make certain that the security measures are not intrusive or too conspicuous , so they are not too noticeable for the athletes , the @entity2 ' guests or journalists , " @entity18 said , according to the interview transcript			1
" but at the same time , we will do our utmost to ensure that they are effective			0
" @entity4 has plenty of experience in keeping international events secure , @entity18 said , pointing to the @entity98 and @entity99 summits as examples			1
" security is to be ensured by some 40,000 law enforcement and special services officers , " he said			0
" of course , we will draw on the experience acquired during similar events held in other regions of the world and in other countries			0
it means that we will protect our air and sea space , as well as the mountain cluster			0
" @entity7 lawmakers : games are n't safe but several @entity7 lawmakers offered a different take sunday on @entity0 's @entity16			1
@entity14 , a member of the @entity116 , said he would n't go to the games himself , " and i do n't think i would send my family			0
" rep. @entity119 , chairman of the @entity120 , also called on the @entity4 government to be more cooperative with the @entity7 on intelligence sharing ahead of the games			1
" their level of concern is great , but we do n't seem to be getting all of the information we need to protect our athletes in the @entity5			0
i think this needs to change , and it should change soon , " @entity119 said			0
when asked whether he thought @entity7 would be safe at the @entity5 , former @entity133 and @entity134 director @entity132 said he trusts @entity4 's ability to provide security			1
" i think @entity7 will be quite safe , " he said			1
@entity18 : ' no danger ' for gay visitors @entity4 's stance on gay rights has been another area of concern for many visitors			1
@entity4 has come under international pressure since its parliament passed a law last summer outlawing " gay propaganda			2
" the legislation makes it illegal to tell children about gay equality and has been widely criticized by @entity153 leaders , who have called it archaic and discriminatory			0
but @entity18 defended it before journalists friday , saying that the law was about protecting children			2
" we have just recently passed a law prohibiting propaganda , and not of homosexuality , but of homosexuality and child abuse , child sexual abuse			0
but this has nothing to do with persecuting individuals for their sexual orientation , " he said			0
" so there is no danger for people of such nontraditional sexual orientation who are planning to come to the @entity5 as guests or participants			0
" @entity4 has also been criticized over the limitations placed on freedom of speech at @entity62			1
the official protest site is about a 30 - minute drive from the @entity180 village and is difficult to find			0
but @entity18 said no visitors should fear problems if they protest , for example , over gay rights			2
@entity18 says gays ' can feel safe ' at @entity186 @entity18 : no corruption the @entity4 leader also dismissed claims that corruption has pushed up the cost of the games , saying there was no proof that had occurred			1
when it won the bid in 2007 , @entity4 said the @entity2 would cost $ 12 billion , but the government 's website now cites the total cost as 1.5 trillion rubles ( $ 45 billion			1
) " i do not see serious corruption instances for the moment , but there is a problem with overestimation of construction volumes , " @entity18 said			2
he suggested the problem was a universal one , where companies underestimate costs in the tendering process in order to win the project , and then push the price back up			0
but , he said , there was no evidence of anything that could be considered corruption , or " theft of public funds with the help of state officials in whose hands these funds fall , " in @entity62			2
" if anyone has such information , give it to us , please			0
i repeat once again , we will be grateful			0
but so far there was nothing but talks , " he said			0
@entity18 put the cost of preparations for the @entity2 at only 214 billion rubles ( $ 6.4 billion ) but acknowledged that the total sum , including the cost of major infrastructure projects , was much higher			1
the total price tag of $ 45 billion outstrips the $ 40 billion @entity234 is thought to have spent on the @entity5 and is more than three times the cost of the @entity236 in 2012			0
@entity237 , former deputy prime minister of @entity4 and a vocal critic of @entity18 , published a report last year describing the @entity62 games as one of the most " outrageous swindles " in recent @entity4 history			1
he claimed that up to 60 % of the final cost -- or $ 30 billion -- has been embezzled			0
@entity0 's @entity245 in @entity62 , @entity246 in @entity247 and @entity248 in @entity249 contributed to this report .			2
