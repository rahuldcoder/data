-- the @entity1 says it 's " ready to go " if it gets orders to carry out a military strike in response to @entity7 's suspected use of chemical weapons against its own people			1
most people know @entity7 's civil war has been raging for more than two years			1
but the situation is so complicated that it 's hard for even the biggest news junkie to keep track			0
now that @entity17 is seriously thinking about ordering limited missile strikes in one of the most volatile regions of the world , it 's a good time to retrace events and remember how we got here			0
here 's a quick - read cheat sheet about the @entity7 civil war			1
it 's not intended to be an all - encompassing encyclopedia , but it will bring you up to date on what 's really important about a scary situation in an already volatile part of the world			0
who wants what after chemical weapons horror ? 1			1
what did @entity7 look like before the conflict ? even before the uprising in @entity7 , things were n't peaceful there			1
in 1982 , president @entity41 clamped down on a @entity43 uprising			0
in one attack , his iron fist left tens of thousands dead			0
when @entity41 died in 2000 , his son @entity46 took over the presidency			0
he promised to build a more modern and democratic nation			0
but reforms did n't come fast enough for activists , who called for change and slammed @entity7 's government as an " authoritarian , totalitarian and cliquish regime			1
" sectarian and ethnic unrest shook @entity7 over the past decade , too			1
a @entity57 uprising flared in 2000 , and a @entity59 rebellion erupted in 2004			0
how did the civil war begin ? it all started in february 2011 in the city of @entity63 , when authorities arrested 15 schoolchildren for painting anti-government graffiti on the walls of a school			1
the children did n't mince words with the message they painted : " the people want to topple the regime			2
" @entity74 spread that the children were allegedly mistreated while in custody			2
outrage over their arrest grew , fueling protests			1
security forces opened fire , activists say , killing at least four protesters			0
these four , activists say , were the first deaths in @entity7 's civil war			2
within days , according to @entity88 , protests grew into massive rallies made up of thousands			0
their rallying cry : " @entity63 ! " the city whose children sparked a national movement			2
@entity95 : @entity97 military action in @entity7 would spark ' disaster ' 3			2
how did the unrest turn into a call for an end to @entity41 's rule ? it did n't take long for @entity41 to criticize protesters in @entity63			0
in a march 2011 speech before lawmakers , he said " conspirators " started out there and wanted to spread unrest			2
his dismissive remarks , and the way lawmakers applauded afterward , only further fueled protests			2
" that speech had a catastrophic impact , " the @entity115 's @entity114 said last year			0
" people who wanted to support the regime at the time were shocked			0
" two days later , weekly anti-government protests began across @entity7			1
calls for reforms soon escalated into calls for the removal of the entire @entity41 regime			0
now , armed rebels have vowed to accept nothing less than @entity41 's ouster , while the @entity7 government has labeled them terrorists and vowed not to back down			2
the @entity131 estimates that the fighting has claimed more than 100,000 lives			0
ok , but that all started more than two years ago			0
why do some people think the @entity97 needs to take action now ? talking about @entity7 last year , president @entity137 said " a red line for us is , we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized			1
" the implication was clear			0
if @entity7 uses chemical weapons in the civil war , the @entity97 will have to do something			1
now , the @entity145 says it looks like @entity7 has used chemical weapons against its own people			1
what will @entity137 do in response ? whatever it is , it 's time to sit up and take notice , because this news story is moving to another level			0
what justifies intervening if @entity7 uses chemical weapons ? 5			1
what makes chemical weapons a game changer ? some argue that conventional weapons like guns or bombs also have a massive human toll			1
they say chemical weapons should n't be a turning point for the world to act			1
but the @entity145 maintains that they 're a game - changer			1
" the use of chemical weapons is contrary to the standards adopted by the vast majority of nations and international efforts since @entity173 to eliminate the use of such weapons			1
... the use of these weapons on a mass scale and a threat of proliferation is a threat to our national interests and a concern to the entire world , " @entity145 spokesman @entity176 said this week			1
why did n't the @entity97 just send a bunch of weapons to the opposition when it had the chance ? in june , the @entity97 said it would send the rebels small arms , ammunition and potentially anti-tank weapons			2
but that was long after the unrest started			2
why the delay ? some argue that sending weapons to a region of the world that also contains @entity204 extremists is risky business			0
many of the rebel fighters are militants with pro-al @entity209 sympathies , the same stripe of militants @entity97 has battled in @entity212 and @entity213			0
the @entity7 rebels have promised @entity97 and @entity216 officials that any military weaponry they get wo n't end up in extremists ' hands			2
but that has n't quelled criticism from some quarters that arming the rebels is a dangerous risk			0
@entity226 president @entity225 has slammed the decision to arm the opposition			1
at an economic forum in june , he cautioned , " where will those weapons end up ? " 7			0
what 's the deal with @entity226 ? why are they criticizing the @entity97 ? @entity225 has made it clear that @entity226 and the @entity97 do n't see eye to eye when it comes to @entity7			1
@entity226 and @entity7 are longtime allies			1
for one , just take a look at their weapons deals			0
between 2007 and 2010 , @entity226 firms selling weapons to @entity7 made almost $ 5 billion			1
it would be costly for @entity226 to end that relationship , analyst @entity243 said this year " @entity226 's leadership still sees much to lose economically and strategically from cutting @entity7 loose , " @entity243 wrote			1
" @entity226 sees @entity7 as another test case for the @entity249 's appetite for intervention and views the danger of @entity97 involvement as a direct threat to its own interests			1
" there are other reasons to suspect that @entity226 will keep supporting @entity7			1
@entity226 's only naval base in the @entity258 is on the @entity7 coast , and @entity225 is still upset about @entity261 's bombing in @entity262 two years ago that removed @entity226 ally @entity264 from power			1
' red line ' debate : chemical weapons worse than attacks ? 8			1
what 's religion got to do with it ? the @entity273 is @entity274 , a @entity276 offshoot that 's one of the minorities in a country that is nearly three - quarters @entity280			0
@entity281 has filled key positions in his government with extended family members , and many of his supporters are @entity274 and other minorities who fear what might happen if the @entity280 were to gain power			0
because the @entity7 regime is @entity274 and the majority of the country is @entity280 , there are concerns that @entity7 could spiral into even more violence			2
what 's the worst that could happen ? in a worst - case scenario , experts say , the fighting could spill over and make trouble for @entity7 's neighbors , threatening stability in a part of the world that 's already known to be volatile			2
surrounding @entity7 are @entity306 , @entity212 and @entity307 , @entity308 and @entity309			2
the violence has been prompting war refugees to seek safety in some of these nations			0
in @entity309 , there are ethnic tensions involving @entity59 who live along its southern border with @entity7			2
all of these countries have a lot of religious , cultural and historical issues between them that add countless layers of complexity to the crisis			0
and when an entire region of the world loses stability , that worries the international community as a whole			0
@entity0 's @entity334 , @entity335 , @entity336 , @entity337 , @entity338 and @entity339 contributed to this report .			0
