-- @entity1 will make their defense of the @entity4 title without gifted batsman @entity5 , who was omitted from their 15 - man squad tuesday			1
@entity5 was man of the tournament in their triumph in the @entity11 two years ago , but is at odds with teammates and the @entity1 management for " provocative " texts sent to opposition @entity17 players			1
the 32 - year - old was left out of the third test against @entity21 at @entity22 , which ended in a 51 - run defeat , despite scoring a superb century in the previous match of the series			0
he has apologized for the text messages , which allegedly criticized @entity1 captain @entity27 , but it has not been enough to earn him a recall to the @entity1 fold			0
" @entity5 's future involvement is still being determined and he was therefore not considered for selection in either squad , " national selector @entity31 told the official @entity1 website			1
@entity17 born @entity5 averages nearly 50 runs per innings in test cricket and is renowned for his ability to score quickly in one day internationals and the @entity4 format			1
but earlier this year he made a shock announcement to retire from one - day internationals and @entity4 matches for @entity1			2
after his superb 149 in the second test against @entity21 , @entity5 cast further doubt on his future by saying " obstacles " must be overcome for him to continue playing			0
he was believed to be referring to a fake @entity51 account which portrayed him in unflattering terms and was being followed by several of his teammates			0
but @entity5 was soon using @entity54 to announce that he was available again for @entity1 in all forms of cricket			2
it was not enough to earn him selection for the final test where @entity1 lost their @entity61 status and his exile has now continued			0
@entity5 's close friend , the @entity64 cricket legend @entity63 , said tuesday that it was a " tragedy " that he would not be playing for @entity1			1
" there 's a bit too much ego at the @entity1 ( @entity1 ) , there 's no give or take or compromise , " @entity63 told a press conference in @entity67			1
" if he does n't sign his @entity1 contract , if he does n't play for @entity1 again , i just think that 's a tragedy			2
" but @entity63 added : " @entity5 has to put his hand up and say ' i 've conducted myself in a pretty ordinary fashion , too '			0
" @entity1 's squad contained few surprises , with eight survivors of the squad which won the trophy two years ago			1
@entity83 , who scored 95 and 54 in stepping in for @entity5 at @entity22 , is included			0
" we are very much looking forward to beginning the defence of our @entity86 next month , " said @entity31 .			0
