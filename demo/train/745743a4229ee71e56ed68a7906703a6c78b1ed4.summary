for those who would give almost anything for a chance at superstardom , " @entity8 " might be the entertainment industry 's version of a faustian bargain : through 14 seasons , the very successful @entity10 show has exploited the fact that there are millions of singers who are willing to sign onerous deals for the chance to compete			2
but season 11 winner @entity17 is n't going to let the deals he made as a precursor to his fame go unchallenged			1
on january 22 , @entity17 lodged a bombshell petition with the @entity22 that asserts that @entity8 producer @entity23 and its affiliated companies have " manipulated " him into accepting jobs since he hit it big			1
in a filing that reveals some of @entity17 ' post-show tribulations , including being forced to perform for free for one of " @entity8 's " sponsors and not even knowing the title of his last album before it was announced publicly , the singer is seeking to void his various agreements with 19 , said by the star 's lawyer to be " oppressive , fatally conflicted			1

" the value that the fans and the show have given to my career is not lost on me			2
however , i have not felt that i have been free to conduct my career in a way that i am comfortable with			2
i look forward to being able to make my own choices about my career and to being able to make great music and play it for my fans			0
" the petition to determine controversy is grounded on the @entity51 , the @entity53 law that says only licensed talent agents can procure employment for clients			0
in the past , the law has been used as a cudgel by @entity60 artists from @entity61 to @entity62 who wished to escape paying commissions to their managers			0
@entity17 now hopes to have the @entity51 applied to an entertainment company			1
read more : @entity10 's first ' @entity67 ' trailer released before " idol " viewers voted him the winner that year , @entity17 signed a series of contracts governing his management , merchandising , recording and publishing			1
the deals are quite favorable to @entity23 , a company founded by @entity78 that also produces other shows such as " @entity80			2
" for example , according to the complaint , when @entity17 does endorsements , 19 gets as much as a 40 % cut			1
nevertheless , @entity17 tells the @entity22 that 19 has a fiduciary duty to him , and that the company has breached such duty by compelling him to take jobs that are of benefit to the company and its affiliates rather than to him			1
in the time since he 's been on the show , his managers at 19 have lined up gigs like performing at the @entity95 all - star game , singing " @entity98 " at a @entity97 game , and appearing on such shows as @entity100 , the " @entity101 , " " @entity102 " and " @entity103			0
" the appearances are said to have been " procured " by 19 despite not being licensed as an agent			0
this , the petition argues , amounts to a " pattern and practice of flagrant violations of the ( @entity51 )			0
" while some of these gigs boosted @entity116 ' profile and are arguably in his interest , some other appearances by the singer may have done little to boost his career			0
for example , the petition says he did a live show without compensation promoting @entity123 in 2013			0
" in response to @entity127 's questions about why this deal would make sense , 19 admitted the deal was being entered into in exchange for @entity123 's support for the 2013 @entity133 , " says the petition			0
" since @entity127 was not performing on the @entity134 , the only conceivable purpose for @entity136 booking the performance was to help the struggling finances of @entity136 's @entity134			0
" similarly , @entity17 says he performed at a corporate event for an insurance company — only it was labeled an endorsement deal			1
raising a problem with this gig , he says 19 took the position that it was subject to the @entity146 , with a 40 % commission			0
@entity17 argues , " if @entity136 was truly putting @entity127 's best interest above their interests , @entity136 should have taken the position that the performances should be commissioned at the 20 % commission rate provided for in the @entity153			1
" the petition also chronicles other indignities that @entity17 has faced in the past couple of years			1
he says that 19 lined up a producer for his first two albums that compromised his interests			0
he says 19 lied to him , saying that the producer would n't receive greater mechanical royalty rates than he would			0
he adds that 19 has repeatedly withheld information regarding his career , including the title of his " @entity165 " album released last year			0
it 's not unusual for those successful on reality tv shows to renegotiate deals at some point in their career			2
@entity17 says that he " frequently requested " this , but suggests that the relationship between his management company and recording company frustrated any hope of doing so			1
according to the petition , " because 19 recordings , @entity178 is also @entity127 's record company , 19 , as @entity127 's management company , failed to secure even a single improvement to the terms of the @entity183 , in breach of @entity136 's fiduciary obligations to @entity127			0
" represented by attorney @entity187 at @entity188 & @entity189 , @entity17 is making a bold and ambitious attempt to bring entertainment companies like 19 within the scope of the @entity51 , a law that has been controversial since it was added to the books in 1978			1
@entity17 ' attempt to challenge his " idol " deals figures to spark jurisdictional challenges and raise issues about the corporate structure of 19 , which is owned by @entity201			1
@entity116 will likely also have to get around a notable exemption in the @entity51 for the procurement of recording contracts			0
read more : @entity206 ' @entity205 but if @entity17 is successful in voiding his deals as a violation of the @entity51 , the ramifications would be huge — potentially impacting other successful competitors on " idol " as well as perhaps other reality tv competition shows			1
the adjudication of @entity51 disputes also tends to be a very , very slow process , with rulings often happening many years after the initial filing of a petition			0
the result of the creeping pace could put a number of deals in legal limbo , undoubtedly a concern as " idol " and other shows move forward			1
a spokesperson for @entity23 tells the @entity0 , " we 're very proud of everything we 've accomplished together with @entity17 , working closely to help nurture his extraordinary talent and advance his career			2
we have always acted in the best interest of @entity17			2
we will vigorously defend ourselves from any baseless claims to the contrary and from any attempt to interfere with our rights and relationships			2

" idol " winner @entity17 *unhappy* with his deals
@entity17 claims deals are " oppressive "
