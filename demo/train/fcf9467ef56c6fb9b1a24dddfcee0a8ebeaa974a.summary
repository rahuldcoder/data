-- @entity1 marked his 80th and 85th birthdays with parachute jumps			1
he said after the second jump : " just because you 're an old guy , you do n't have to sit around drooling in the corner			2
get out and do something			0
get out and enjoy life			2
" now 88 , @entity1 has been struggling with serious health concerns , including bronchitis			1
we need him to recover , to set an example for the world of how a man can mark his 90th			2
the son of a @entity19 senator , @entity1 has been a naval aviator hero , oil millionaire , member of @entity21 , ambassador to @entity22 , @entity24 director , vice president of the @entity19 and then the president who managed the end of the @entity28			1
he has lived more life than seems possible for any single human being			2
the achievements of that remarkable life are overshadowed by one negative fact : along with @entity34 and @entity35 , @entity1 is only one of three 20th - century presidents to have lost re-election			1
yet while @entity34 's presidency and @entity35 's are largely regarded as failures by posterity , the judgment on @entity1 's has become more forgiving over time			1
eighteen months ago , former president @entity42 paid this tribute to his predecessor in office : " @entity46 did me one of the great favors of my life			1
he asked me , not once , but twice , to work with his father to help people in need : first in @entity52 in the tsunami and then in the @entity54 after @entity55			0
@entity56 told , we took seven trips together			0
it was an amazing experience			0
this man , whom i 'd always liked and respected and then run against in a painful campaign in some ways , i literally came to love			0
" in the years ahead , we will hear more such tributes -- tributes that may at last do justice to a president whose most important accomplishment has been persistently undervalued and misattributed			2
in the summer of 1987 , president @entity68 visited divided @entity69 and urged , " mr. @entity70 , tear down this wall			2
" it was a stirring moment , a stunning speech			0
in documentaries about the end of the @entity28 , that speech always gets prominent attention , as it should			1
yet it is also true that after @entity68 spoke his words ... nothing much happened			0
nothing much happened for a year			0
nothing much happened for a second year			0
not until deep in 1989 , two years later , did the communist system in central @entity81 begin its implosion : first in @entity83 , then in @entity84 and only in november of 1989 in eastern @entity85			0
in one ecstatic night , the @entity88 regime 's border guards did nothing as local protesters overwhelmed the dividing wall			0
then morning came , and @entity81 confronted the same question it had confronted for half a century : what would @entity92 do ? since 1945 , the @entity95 rulers had made clear they would plunge the world into war rather than accept a reunited @entity85			2
in november 1989 , they still commanded the power to do just that			0
over the next few months , the @entity95 changed their minds			0
they acquiesced to the surrender of their single most fundamental geopolitical claim			0
they acquiesced without violence and without getting much of anything in return			0
in the history of world diplomacy , there has never been a negotiation like this one			0
that work of negotiation fell not to the eloquent @entity68 but to @entity1 , who never saw a speech he did n't mangle			1
there is no " tear down this wall " clip by @entity1			1
but it was during his presidency that the wall was in fact demolished -- and not by some lucky accident but after months of agonizing work by @entity85 and @entity19 together			1
there 's a saying in @entity126 : " he who will not toot his own horn , his horn shall not be tooted			1
" @entity1 is an inveterate non-horn - tooter			1
he did not toot his horn over the end of the @entity28			1
he did not toot his own horn over his deficit reductions			1
he believed that horn - tooting risked alienating the very people whose cooperation had made the accomplishment possible in the first place			2
very likely , he was right , too			0
as the former president fights off the illness that sent him to the hospital , though , perhaps it would be well if he did hear a few toots from other people 's horns : the @entity85 and other @entity145 @entity81 whose progress to freedom his diplomacy assisted ; the @entity149 who owe their country to him ; and too - neglectful @entity19 , to whom he bequeathed a world more peaceful , more stable and more free			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity155 .			1

@entity155 : @entity1 , 88 , must recover to continue to inspire on way to 90
@entity1 has *packed* much into life : war hero , ambassador , @entity24 chief , *vp* , president
he says elder @entity1 not given enough *credit* for role in *shepherding* end of @entity28
