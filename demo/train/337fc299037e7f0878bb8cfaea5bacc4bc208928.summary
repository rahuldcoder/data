-- using a new " @entity2 " game mechanic , " starhawk " offers more than your typical third - person shooter , tapping ino the player 's strategic thinking while creating an enjoyable ride			1
@entity9 founder @entity9 wanted to take one of their old titles , " @entity13 , " and make it into something more enjoyable and more complete			1
" @entity13 , " released in 2007 , was widely praised for its multiplayer action , but it had no single - player campaign			1
@entity20 and his team took the best ideas from " @entity13 , " combined them with a new setting and single - player campaign , then added his a new mechanic that effectively creates what can be considered a new way to think about shooters			1
" @entity33 " allows players to call down hardware from a ship circling high above the planet			1
when i say hardware , i do n't mean a weapons cache full of ammo and guns			2
i mean large , physical structures and buildings that allow players to defend , attack and punish the enemy			1
@entity44 with turrets on top , garages with jet cycles inside , buggies , tanks and tall sniper towers complete with rifles -- all are at the players ' command			1
these items and many more can be called down and placed on the battlefield for maximum damage or protection			2
ground and air vehicles can also be called down and used			2
jet bikes and @entity63 ( three - player combat buggies ) handle a lot of the ground transportation			0
ox tanks can bring the pain with artillery shells and cannons			0
( as their name implies , they can take a lot of punishment but are slow to move )			0
if you are looking for more speed and maneuverability , the @entity74 is a transformer - like vehicle that switches from armored robot to nimble aircraft quickly			0
on the ground , a " mech stomp " wipes out scores of troops , while in the air , the jet has a range of specialized missiles and bombs at its disposal			0
each one of these vehicles can be spawned from a garage summoned with the " @entity97 " mechanic			1
as with the other buildings , planning must be utilized to determine prime placement as well as how each garage can be defended			2
the " @entity33 " concept works seamlessley within combat and adds a strategic element to each battle			0
no longer do players have to think only about conserving ammunition			2
now , they need create the environment around themselves while taking on waves of enemies			0
do you use walls to block routes into your area ? or do you arrange them to funnel the enemy into a gauntlet of beam turrets ? it is this flexibility of gameplay that makes " starhawk " enjoyable and interesting			2
plus , if a particularly large group of scabs ( the enemy grunts ) are headed your way , you can always just drop a building on them			0
each structure costs " rift energy , " a universal source of power harvested from different planets , much like oil on @entity132			0
indeed , the single - player campaign has a @entity138 feel and motif that could remind gamers of the great @entity141 in the @entity142			0
rifters want to capture the rift energy to sell it , while outcasts believe the rift energy to be their lifeblood and want to destroy all who would take it			0
@entity147 , the main character in the campaign , goes into the disputed areas to reclaim the rift from the @entity144			0
the storyline is told through cinematic videos rather than actual gameplay and merely acts as rather weak glue between the combat set pieces			0
despite trying to inject some connection between @entity147 and the leader of the @entity144 , characters in the story come across as emotionless and uncaring about anything other than getting the job done			0
but it 's multiplayer mode where the game really shines			1
up to 32 players can battle in four different scenarios and five different environments across two maps			1
more maps are planned as downloadable content ( @entity172 ) , which @entity20 says will be free to all			0
the " @entity2 " mechanic is at its best in the @entity178 and @entity179 modes			1
teammates work together to build walls , turrets and repair arms to defend their areas while others take vehicles out to seek and destroy the opposing side			2
coordination is key and many battles have been won due to the combined efforts of teammates defending or attacking en masse			0
the more players per side , the more action and organized chaos there is across the battlefield			1
it truly is some of the best and most enjoyable gameplay i 've experienced on the @entity202			0
overall , the combat in " starhawk " is refreshing , thoughtful and very well done			2
the environments are as beautiful as the " @entity2 " mechanic is unique			1
the breadth of weapons , vehicles and buildings make each playthrough different , and the multiplayer highlights the best of all that is available			1
while the campaign story is disappointing , " starhawk " ends up being a game that shines in spite of its weak characters			1
in some ways , the " @entity2 " system is the true star of the action , and that 's just fine for gamers who enjoy thinking their way through a battle as much , if not more , than shooting their way through one			1
" starhawk " is available now worldwide exclusively for the @entity202			2
it is rated t for teens due to blood , language , and violence			0
this review was done with a provided copy for the @entity202 and multiplayer action done on public servers .			1

unique " @entity2 " mechanic sets " starhawk " apart from other shooters
players can select buildings , vehicles and other tools to place and use in fights
multiplayer action gets intense , with up to 32 players at a time
the game is an *offshoot* of the 2007 game " @entity13 "
