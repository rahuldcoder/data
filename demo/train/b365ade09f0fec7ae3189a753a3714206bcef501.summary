-- that was a pretty catchy , sing - songy version of @entity3 's rap hit " @entity4 " in thursday night 's episode of " @entity6			2
" it was also very familiar to fans of indie singer - songwriter @entity9			1
as angry @entity9 fans are clamoring on @entity11 , @entity9 arranged and recorded an eerily similar " @entity4 " cover			1
so similar , in fact , that the " @entity6 " version included @entity9 's line " @entity19 's in trouble , " replacing the lyric " @entity3 's in trouble " in the original song			1
@entity9 said he was not informed beforehand , nor was he given any credit or compensation for having arranged the melody of the cover song			1
what 's more , he says , @entity26 representatives told @entity9 's representatives that " they 're within their legal rights to do this , and that i should be happy for the exposure , " he wrote on his blog , " even though they do not credit me , and have not even publicly acknowledged that it 's my version -- so you know , it 's kind of secret exposure			2
" a representative from @entity39 told @entity0 friday the network is not commenting on the matter			0
@entity9 , known for nerdy and humorous songs such as " @entity43 , " said friday that he is " mystified " about why the show went about using the cover song in this way			1
" glee has a reputation for being a show that celebrates the underdog , " he said , before catching a plane to @entity48			0
" it 's the anti-bullying show			0
but this is a bullying way to approach this			0
" when it comes to copyright protection , however , there 's a distinction between what might seem ethical and what is legal , lawyers say			0
the rights to " @entity4 " belong with songwriter @entity64 , also known as sir @entity3 , and his music publisher , @entity67 , who have apparently given proper licenses to @entity26 and " @entity6 , " said @entity69 , a copyright attorney with the @entity71 law firm in @entity72 who does not represent any party involved in what @entity11 users are calling # @entity77			1
because @entity9 's cover is derivative of the original work by @entity3 , @entity9 does not have a copyright claim against " @entity6 " for using the @entity9 version , @entity69 said			1
covers do n't get their own copyright protection as far as the underlying musical composition , @entity69 said			0
but @entity9 might have legal footing if the show used @entity9 's audio track			2
" if ' glee ' used parts of @entity9 's actual recording , there would be a copyright claim for him to pursue , " @entity69 said			1
" if not , @entity9 's gripe may have moral weight , but not the force of law			2
" fans of @entity9 are not taking this lightly			2
some are undertaking sophisticated audio analyses of both song versions , @entity9 said			1
one called " alacrion " created a side - by - side comparison of the two songs on @entity104 , demonstrating a remarkable resemblance			0
a fan named @entity108 posted his own investigation into the similarities of the audio , which he called " pretty convincing			0
" " hilariously , for me , it comes down to the sound of a duck quacking , which is a sound effect that was in my version , used as a bleep noise to cover up an expletive , " @entity9 said			2
" while it is very hard to hear , if i at home mess with the equalizer settings and some filters , i can actually hear that quack is in that mix. " from this , @entity9 believes at least some of his audio was used by the show , although he is unsure how much			2
@entity108 explored this quack issue as well , but wrote on his blog that he identified the " ghost of the quack			0
" there have been infringement cases involving rap songs that sampled even four to eight seconds of other songs , and that was deemed illegal , said @entity136 , director of the @entity138 program in law , science & technology who is also not representing anyone in this controversy			0
it may seem like an artist should get paid if his song , whether a cover or something else , is imitated elsewhere , but this is " one of those holes in the law that just does n't end up giving the owner of the sound recording copyright much in the way of rights , " @entity136 said			1
@entity9 said his lawyer is in touch with " the people at ' @entity6			1
' " geek celebrities such as the band @entity159 and podcaster @entity162 came out in support of @entity9 on @entity11			1
astronomer @entity164 , author of @entity166 's " @entity167 " column , tweeted with a link to another story about the debacle : " i 'll admit it : i used to watch and enjoy @entity6			0
it 's dead to me			0
" as of this writing , sir @entity3 has not responded on his own @entity11 account .			0

indie artist @entity9 says ' glee ' used his cover song
lawyer : for a cover song , the copyright remains with the original artist , not the cover artist
@entity9 is exploring whether his actual audio was used by ' @entity6 '
many @entity9 fans are expressing anger on @entity11
