-- a man on trial for gunning down a @entity4 abortion provider in church said he had no regrets because " abortion is murder			1
" @entity9 , 51 , said he shot and killed dr. @entity10 as services began on may 31 to save the lives of the unborn			1
" there was nothing being done and the legal process had been exhausted , and these babies were dying every day , " @entity9 said			2
" i did what i thought was needed to be done to protect the children			0
" @entity9 is charged with one count of first - degree murder for the death of @entity10 , who ran a women 's clinic in @entity24 where abortions were performed , including the controversial late - term procedure			1
@entity9 was the only witness for the defense , which rested its case thursday			2
@entity31 district judge @entity30 told jurors closing arguments will be held friday morning , depending on the weather			0
after the jury left , @entity30 ruled that the jury could not consider convicting @entity9 of the lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter , which is defined as " an unreasonable but honest belief that circumstances existed that justified deadly force " under @entity4 statute			1
@entity30 said testimony did not support the defense claim that @entity9 's beliefs on abortion justified the use of deadly force against @entity10			1
@entity10 , 67 , was one of the few @entity49 doctors who performed late - term abortions			1
he had already survived one attempt on his life and a clinic bombing before he was slain			0
during @entity9 's testimony thursday , @entity10 's widow , @entity55 , and other family members sat in the gallery			1
initially stoic , they began to dab at tears as @entity9 described putting a gun to @entity10 's head			1
asked if he regretted what he did , @entity9 said , " no , i do n't			2
" upon learning that @entity10 's clinic was shut down after his death , he said he felt " a sense of relief			1
" dressed in a dark suit , white shirt and a red patterned tie , @entity9 calmly testified that he had a long - standing belief that @entity10 should die			1
he thought about different ways to kill the doctor -- driving a car into him , perhaps , or shooting him with a rifle			1
his main concern , @entity9 said , was that he might harm others			2
under cross-examination by @entity31 district attorney @entity79 , he said he also considered cutting @entity10 's hands off with a sword , but decided that would not be effective , as @entity10 would still be able to train others			2
@entity9 said that through the anti-abortion group @entity84 he learned that @entity10 took measures to protect himself -- traveling in an armored car , using a security escort , wearing a bulletproof vest and living in a gated community			1
he decided to kill @entity10 at his church , he said , because " i felt that actually if he was to be stopped , that was probably the only place he could have been stopped			1
... it was the only window of opportunity i saw			0
" @entity9 said he visited the church four or five times before @entity10 's death			1
the week before the shooting , on may 24 , he carried a .22 - caliber handgun with him , he testified , but @entity10 did not attend church that day			1
on may 31 , though , the doctor was greeting congregants in the foyer of @entity103 before @entity9 walked up to him and shot him at point blank range			0
" the lives of those children were in imminent danger if someone did not stop @entity10 , " @entity9 said			1
" under questioning from @entity79 , @entity9 acknowledged that he " somewhat " admired those who previously had committed violence against abortion providers			2
he said his anti-abortion beliefs " go hand in hand " with his religious beliefs			0
he said he became born again in 1992 after watching an episode of " the @entity116			0
" asked if there are any circumstances in which he believes abortion is acceptable , @entity9 said he thought it could be if the mother 's life was in " absolute " danger			1
" i struggle with that decision , " he said , " because i believe that ultimately , it is up to our heavenly father			0
but if there was a time , that would be it			0
" he said he did not believe abortion was justified in the case of rape			0
" you are taking the life of the innocent			0
you 're punishing the innocent life for the sin of the father			0
two wrongs do n't make a right			0
" asked about incest , he said his beliefs were the same : " it is n't our duty to take life , it 's our heavenly father 's			0
" @entity9 's testimony was peppered with objections from prosecutors			2
many objections were sustained by @entity30 , who has maintained he does not want the trial to become a forum on abortion			0
in a conference out of the presence of jurors , @entity30 cautioned @entity9 , saying specifics on medical procedures would not be allowed			0
@entity9 's testimony would proceed , @entity30 said , " on a question - by - question basis			2
" @entity9 recounted conducting what he called " sidewalk counseling " at @entity164 abortion clinics , handing pamphlets and other literature to women as they went inside			1
" some of them did ultimately change their mind , " he said			0
in opening statements thursday , defense attorney @entity171 told jurors @entity9 " killed dr. @entity10 because he believed that was the only way , necessary to save the lives of the unborn			1
" defense attorneys claim @entity9 was also motivated by authorities ' failure to punish him through the judicial system			0
@entity30 refused to allow former @entity4 attorney general @entity182 to testify on behalf of the defense			0
on wednesday , he refused to allow testimony from current deputy attorney general @entity185			0
@entity182 unsuccessfully attempted to prosecute @entity10 in 2006			0
@entity185 charged @entity10 with 19 misdemeanor counts , but a jury acquitted the doctor			2
@entity30 said @entity9 can testify about the cases and how they affected his beliefs , but to allow testimony from @entity182 would " get into legal matters that do not concern this jury			2
" and , the judge said , the cases do not give @entity9 a basis to state absolutely that @entity10 's actions were illegal , since the doctor had never been convicted			1
@entity9 testified he was " very frustrated " by @entity10 's acquittal , saying it " seemed like that was the last attempt by the state of @entity4 to find if there was anything at all going on illegally in @entity10 's clinic			1
" @entity210 , founder of @entity84 , told reporters outside the courtroom the trial is " a railroad , a kangaroo court , where they are denying critical evidence about what was on @entity9 's mind when he pulled the trigger			2
" " perhaps if the @entity31 prosecutors had done a better job prosecuting @entity10 for how he illegally killed babies , he would still be alive , " @entity210 said .			0
