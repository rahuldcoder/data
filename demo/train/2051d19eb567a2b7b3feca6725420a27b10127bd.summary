-- in @entity3 's picturesque @entity2 , life moves at a gentle pace			1
tractors trundle along narrow country roads while sleepy vineyards blossom beneath the pleasant glare of the mid-afternoon sun. it 's here , amidst this green and fertile hinterland , that the roots of @entity3 's modern wine making industry have borne fruit			1
but conflict across the wider @entity17 region has disrupted this idyllic country scene in recent years			1
according to @entity20 , managing director of local winemaker @entity21 , tourists have been put off from traveling the @entity2 because of the violence unfolding nearby			1
visitors from neighboring @entity25 were once among @entity21 's best customers , he says , but that 's changed dramatically since that country 's devastating civil war began three years ago			1
" we used to have 70,000 visitors per year , " @entity20 says			0
" the @entity31 and the @entity32 and @entity33 used to come to @entity25 and then to visit @entity3			1
" " it ( also ) affected us because we used to export 300,000 bottles to @entity25 per year			2
now we 're exporting around 50,000 only			0
" @entity21 has been forced to look towards new markets to make up for this shortfall			0
along with @entity3 's other wine makers they are rallying to promote their goods and produce collectively			1
" when we go to international fairs , we go under a @entity3 pavilion , " says @entity20			1
" before every participant used to go and to have his own booth			0
" @entity20 explains that the group is looking to sell the story and history of @entity3 and not just its wines			1
he points to a group of ancient cellars discovered beneath land owned by @entity21 in 1898 as an example of @entity3 's rich wine producing past			1
" there are a million bottles of wine , stored in these cellars that date back to the @entity59 era , " he says			2
" walls of wine , steeped in history			2
" winemaking dates back thousands of years in @entity3 but modern day production really did n't start until the 20th century			1
according to wine writer @entity65 , this puts @entity3 behind other wine - producing nations in terms of marketing its global reputation			1
" we [ @entity3 ] produce eight million bottles of wine a year which may sound like a lot but if we compare that to @entity74 , which produces 70 million , @entity75 around 35 to 40 million			1
@entity76 produce about 50 million -- so even on a regional scale we 're tiny			0
global scale ? we 're a dot			0
" " i mean @entity81 the biggest producer in the world probably produces on average around four billion bottles a year			0
" but bigger is n't always better			0
the rarity of @entity3 wine is a distinguishing factor that businesses can capitalize on to help their product stand out , @entity65 believes			1
" the message they should be sending consumers is we only make eight million bottles a year , " he says			2
" come and get them while you can			0
" " there 's no reason why @entity3 wine can not be the sexiest wine on the planet			1
" to that end , it 's not just the large - scale wineries capping every bottle with a personal touch			0
smaller family - run wine businesses like @entity108 are getting in on the act as well			0
" the message behind this winery is to produce quality wines , products from this land made by people working in this land , " says company co-owner , @entity110			0
@entity108 produces a not inconsiderable 250,000 bottles of wine each year			0
but the company 's specialty remains arak , a @entity3 spirit made from aniseed			1
" we 're a leader now in the local market for the arak , " says @entity110			0
" ( our arak product is sold ) in around 15 to 17 countries , a bit everywhere where the @entity3 people are			2
" with the arak market well - tapped , @entity110 says he wants to expand the company 's wine business to achieve his ultimate dream			2
" my target is more ... global			0
to show @entity3 everywhere , to have @entity3 wine in the list of each and every restaurant in the whole world			1
" @entity110 is acutely aware , however , that @entity3 still has to overcome negative images abroad			2
the country remains divided along religious lines and a number of suicide - bomb attacks have rocked the country this year			0
@entity20 says he could n't agree more with @entity110 's sentiment			0
" the message that we want to forward to the world is that @entity3 is not an exporter of terrorism , @entity3 is an exporter of culture and good wines , " @entity20 says			2
getting out and showing the very best of what his country has to offer is a key method of doing just that .			0

wine has been produced in @entity3 's @entity2 for thousands of years
@entity3 winemakers hope to play on that history when selling to international consumers
