-- if you frequent the pistes of the @entity3 , you may see more than just skiers and snowmen scattered around the trails below			2
for the last 10 years , @entity8 artist @entity7 has been decorating snow - covered lakes and mountainsides with massive geometric designs , often based on fractal patterns , using his footsteps as his implement			1
@entity7 's snow drawings have attracted attention and opportunity beyond the @entity19 ski resort in @entity20 where he got his start			1
this year alone , he 's delivered @entity22 in @entity23 and @entity24 , collaborated with @entity27 clothing brand @entity25 on a series of garments , and has seen his international @entity30 following grow to 280,000			2
now he adds @entity31 , a book of over 200 photos he has taken of his work , to his list of accomplishments			1
from engineering , to orienteering , to art @entity7 's journey to art was unconventional			1
he was working as an orienteering cartographer when he made his first snow drawing , and before that the @entity45 graduate was an engineer			1
he created his first snow drawing , a star on a lake near his apartment at @entity19 , to pass the time after a day of skiing in 2004			1
" when i did my first drawing , i had no idea how good it was going to look , " he says			2
" it 's just so unusual and unique			0
no one else is doing anything like it			0
" but it was n't until five years ago , when he recognized the toll that his frequent orienteering trips had taken on his feet , that he started to take his drawings seriously			1
" i realized that it would probably be better to do something a bit easier than orienteering , and do something less painful , " he says			1
snow drawing went from an occasional hobby to his primary form of exercise during the winter months			2
one hundred and fifty snow drawings later , quite a few things have changed			2
where he was once restricted to scouting locations and photographing his work from mountain tops and ski lifts , he can now afford to work out of an aircraft if he chooses ; instead of winter boots , he now wears snowshoes			0
his work has gone from a fairly solitary pleasure to something enjoyed by thousands online			0
however , his techniques have remained the same			0
@entity7 still walks as many as 30 km across distances as large as six soccer fields , counting each pace as he would while orienteering , armed with nothing but a compass and a map he designed himself			1
a single drawing can still take as long as 12 hours to realize			0
but he now has his art down to science			0
@entity7 knows the best terrain ( thoroughly frozen lakes ) , the best time to shoot ( just before the drawing goes into shadow at the end of the day ) , and the best conditions ( sunny , at least one foot of snow )			1
he can now shift his focus from creating the perfect drawing to pushing himself creatively			0
exploring new territory earlier this year , @entity7 spent time in @entity27 and @entity105 in the @entity8 creating sand drawings , raking complex designs into the sand to be washed away by encroaching tides			1
fans have suggested that he try his hand at working in mud or deserts , or even try mowing a lawn , but he 'd most like to try his hand at creating crop formations			0
he 'd also like to start exploring more remote lakes in the towns surrounding the @entity3 , like @entity119 , @entity120			0
" and there are other places i 'd just like to ( try ) because of the location , like @entity124 in @entity125			0
i 'd love to do a drawing there , or on the grounds of the @entity129 , @entity131 gardens , or the parks in @entity133 , " he adds			0
" if you ever got the conditions to be right , it would be fantastic to go and do something like that , and get famous buildings in the background			0
" @entity31 by @entity7 ( @entity141 ) is available for purchase online at snowart.gallery			1
when art , design and a whole load of plants collide art works that mess with your sense of scale @entity153 's ' most complicated ' watch sells for record $ 24.4 million			2

@entity7 creates geometric shapes in the snow with his footsteps
the designs are often *inspired* by fractals and other *mathematical* patterns
@entity7 *previously* worked as an orienteering map - maker , and as an engineer
his new book , @entity31 , *includes* over 200 images of his best works
