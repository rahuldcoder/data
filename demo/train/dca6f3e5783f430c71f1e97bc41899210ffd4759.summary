the police chief in @entity1 , @entity2 , is expected to step down as part of the effort by city officials to reform the police department , according to government officials familiar with the ongoing discussions between local , state and federal officials			1
but chief @entity12 and the city 's mayor say the reports are n't true			1
under the proposed plan , after @entity12 leaves , city leadership would ask the @entity19 police chief to take over management of @entity1 's police force			1
the announcement could come as soon as next week			0
it would be one step in what local officials hope will help reduce tensions in the city as the public awaits a decision on whether the @entity19 grand jury will bring charges against officer @entity33 in the fatal shooting of @entity35			1
" the animosity that existed in @entity1 were way before @entity39 's shooting , justified or not			1
so , unfortunately , the leadership in the police department has to change , " said @entity3 legal analyst @entity40			2
" and if he 's sort of a sacrificial lamb to get this started , it 's going to have to be			2
@entity1 's going to have to more forward			1
and it does n't seem they can move forward with this police chief in place			1
" @entity12 said tuesday he is not being pushed out			2
" nobody in my chain of command has asked me to resign , nor have i been terminated , " he said on the phone to @entity3			2
and @entity1 mayor @entity54 said there is no plan in place for the police chief to step down			1
when asked whether the federal government was pressuring the city to force out the police chief , he told @entity3 : " people have been saying that for months , i mean for him to step down			1
but we 've stood by him this entire time			0
so there is no change on that			0
" the @entity19 suburb drew national attention after protests erupted following @entity33 's shooting of @entity35 , an 18 - year - old unarmed @entity72			1
@entity33 , who is white , has n't been charged in the case , though a grand jury is hearing evidence that could lead to an indictment			2
@entity3 analyst @entity77 think @entity12 's removal , if true , is indication that the grand jury may decide not to indict the officer			1
" to me this is all calibrated and intended to take the temperature down of the community , " @entity77 said			0
" i 'm absolutely convinced we 're headed for no indictment in this case			2
@entity12 had faced criticism over his department 's handling of the @entity35 shooting and the protests in its aftermath			1
last month , weeks after the @entity93 announced it was investigating @entity1 police , @entity12 told @entity3 he would not step down despite calls for his ouster			1
" i 've talked to a lot of people who have initially called for that and then changed their mind after having meetings and discussions about moving forward , " he said			0
" realistically , i 'm going to stay here and see this through			0
" speaking about his job and the fallout over the @entity35 shooting , he said , " this is mine , and i 'm taking ownership of it			2
" @entity93 investigators are looking at the @entity115 's use of force , analyzing stops , searches and arrests and examining the treatment of individuals detained at @entity1 's city jail , @entity112 attorney general @entity111 has said			1
that complicates plans expressed by some officials who want to dissolve the entire @entity115 and turn over law enforcement to county police			0
in an interview with @entity3 last week , @entity111 said the @entity93 was looking at the leadership of the @entity130 as part of its ongoing investigation of the department 's practices			1
" we have an ongoing -- having a practice investigation into the @entity115			0
and we 're looking at a whole variety of things , including the leadership of that department , the practices that the department engages in , the nature of the interaction between the department and the community that it is supposed to serve , " @entity111 said			0
" so i think it 's a little premature for me at this point to comment on the leadership of the @entity115			0
that is certainly something that we are looking at			0
" last month , @entity12 released a video apology he said was directed at @entity35 's parents and the peaceful demonstrators who took to @entity1 's streets to protest the teen 's death			1
" the right of the people to peacefully assemble is what the police are here to protect			0
if anyone who was peacefully exercising that right is upset and angry , i feel responsible and i 'm sorry , " he said			0
he also acknowledged that the incident had sparked a larger conversation about societal issues			0
" overnight i went from being a small - town police chief to being part of a conversation about racism , equality and the role of policing in that conversation			1
as chief of police , i want to be part of that conversation			2
i also want to be part of the solution , " he said			0
he conceded that @entity1 and the surrounding areas have " much work to do			2
" " for any mistakes i 've made , i take full responsibility			0
it 's an honor to serve the city of @entity1 and the people who live there			1
i look forward to working with you in the future to solve our problems , and once again , i deeply apologize to the @entity35 family , " he said			2
later that day , he waded into the crowd at a protest and apologized again			0
some people seemed satisfied by his apologies			0
but not everyone was anxious to hear from him			0
one man shouted into a bullhorn : " if you are not resigning tonight , go home			0
