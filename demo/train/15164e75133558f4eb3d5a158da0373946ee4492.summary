-- the year 2012 was a historic one for @entity1			2
it was the first time two women from the country competed at an @entity5			0
a month earlier , ten @entity1 women climbed to @entity8 base camp , headed by princess @entity9 to raise awareness of breast cancer and to promote physical activity			2
however the situation for sports women from the country was different at the recently completed @entity16 in @entity17			1
western media and various international organizations including @entity20 commented that not one of the 199 athletes from @entity1 was a woman			2
@entity23 , the secretary general of @entity1 's @entity24 said that @entity1 was committed to sending female athletes to the next @entity5 , but " they were not yet competitive enough for the @entity16			1
" " technically , we were n't ready to introduce any ladies and the new president of our @entity5 committee ( prince @entity31 ) rejected sending women to only participate , as he wanted them to compete , " said @entity23			0
@entity34 is a women 's basketball team started in 2003			1
in 2006 it evolved into a sports company that trains both girls and boys in team sports with the aim of promoting sports in the @entity43 and developing potential @entity5 talents			0
since the company was established , an elite team for both girls and boys has been training hard for possible international competition and to lay the foundation for a potential girls national team			0
over the years there have been many statements by high - ranking officials in the local media in @entity1 that supported integrating girl sports in public schools , opening private clubs , allowing female participation in neighborhood centers , and setting the stage for more @entity5 participation			1
however , logistical challenges remain , as there are no local sports professionals and no space is being made available in these public schools			0
in addition to that , very limited private facilities are available for similar activities , and there are no female members of @entity1 's various sporting federations with the exception of @entity77 in the @entity78			1
finally , the absence of physical education departments in colleges and universities is another major hindrance to seeing more girls and women in sports			0
however , and in accordance with prince @entity89 's vision , @entity34 believes that , in international competitions , female athletes should be at a level to compete and not just participate symbolically			1
@entity1 athletes need to train and be ready physically , mentally , and emotionally			2
government and private sectors need to collaborate to make this a reality			0
public funds need to be allocated , as the private sector alone will not be able to nurture sports women to a level so they can compete against others from countries that have supported women sports for decades			1
the good news is that the government can rely on existing teams , athletes and initiatives that have been running for years on their own that will be the foundation for women sports in @entity1			1
