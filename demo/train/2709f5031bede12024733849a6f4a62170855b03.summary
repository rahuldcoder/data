for many kids , a trip to @entity1 is a dream come true			1
but for some of those kids and their families who visited " the happiest place on @entity10 " a few weeks ago , that dream has become a nightmare			0
in the past month , 36 people have come down with measles traced to an exposure at the theme park , including five employees of @entity1			1
prior to the introduction of a vaccine in 1967 , nearly every @entity17 got the measles ; but since 2000 , it has effectively been eradicated in this country , with the only sources of exposure being foreign visitors or @entity17 who traveled and brought it back			1
the threat is growing , however , because not enough people are getting vaccinated and even for those who have gotten vaccinated , the overall trend is a problem for all of us			1
vaccine rates in the @entity17 have been in steady decline since the late ' 90s			0
seventeen states now have fewer than 90 % of children vaccinated for measles			1
often times , like - minded people who have unvaccinated children tend to cluster in the same communities , thus creating pockets with very low vaccination rates			1
the reduction in vaccination rates reveals one of the quirks of vaccines ; they only protect a population if nearly everyone is vaccinated			1
this is the concept of herd immunity			0
the magic number for measles is 95 , which means if at least 95 % of people in a community are vaccinated , everyone is protected			1
this is because the chance of the virus finding the individuals in the group who have little or no protection is very low			0
if a vaccinated , and protected , person gets measles they may not even know it , but the virus will be stopped in its tracks by their immune response before they can make more people sick			1
however , the more poorly protected , or unprotected , people there are , the easier it is for the virus to find them , make them sick and spread			1
for those of you who are vaccinated and might be thinking you 're protected from infection even in communities with vaccination rates lower than 95 % , you still need to worry			1
adults can be affected , too			0
in fact , 13 of the 18 confirmed cases of measles in @entity85 were adults			1
while the measles vaccine is extremely effective -- the best we have -- effectiveness can reduce over time , leaving both children and adults vulnerable , even if they were vaccinated			1
therefore , the risk of any one of us coming down with a completely preventable childhood disease like measles will increase if vaccination rates continue to decline			2
@entity98 officials have recognized the importance of vaccination			0
after learning of the exposure , they offered vaccination and immunity tests to their employees , according to a statement issued by the @entity106 chief medical officer , dr. @entity107			2
of the five employees affected , three have been medically cleared to return to work , a spokesman said , and others are on paid leave until medically cleared			0
to be sure , there are valid medical reasons that some children ca n't be vaccinated , such as allergies to components of the vaccine , underlying diseases that compromise the immune system , or because they are simply too young			2
but these children vitally depend on herd immunity to protect them from childhood diseases			0
the unfortunate reality , however , is that more and more parents are choosing not to vaccinate their children for nonmedical reasons			0
some refuse vaccines on the grounds of religious beliefs ; others refuse on the repeatedly disproved argument that vaccines contribute to autism			0
their high - risk decision not to vaccinate endangers not only their children , but also those who ca n't receive the vaccines , and even those of us who have had the vaccine a long time ago , and depend on herd immunity			0
5 things to know about measles regardless of the reason why parents choose not to vaccinate their children , it is important for the rest of us to realize they are making the choice for all of us , too			2
by not vaccinating their own children , they increase everyone else 's chance of getting a preventable childhood disease like measles , whooping cough or even polio			2
just last week , a 25 - day - old baby died of whooping cough , which , like measles , is also spreading unnecessarily in the @entity17 due to the decrease in vaccine rates			2
just like the drunk driver who makes a socially irresponsible decision that can endanger not only his life , but also the lives of the other drivers and passengers on the road , parents who choose not to vaccinate their children put everyone else at risk			0
we can each play a part in protecting children by making sure parents understand their responsibility to vaccinate their children and the potential consequences on all of society if they do n't			0
it 's a small world after all , and the actions of the few can , and do , affect the many .			0

a measles *outbreak* resulted after exposure at @entity1 ; 36 became ill
@entity192 : fewer people getting vaccinated , raising risks for all of us
