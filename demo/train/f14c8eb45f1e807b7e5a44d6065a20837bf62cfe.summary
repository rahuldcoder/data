-- unbeaten in 18 races , @entity1 has already entered horse racing 's history books and become a sprinting superstar in her native @entity6			1
but will the mare be able to translate that to international success this year ? @entity1 's annihilation of the rest of the field in saturday 's @entity13 in @entity14 matched the feats of legendary 18th century racehorse @entity16 , putting them joint third in the all - time list of undefeated thoroughbreds			1
her trainer @entity20 will now be hoping that history repeats when she defends her @entity24 crown at @entity25 this saturday			2
but the bigger tests , and larger plaudits , will rest in overseas challenges			0
her 18th successive win , at the @entity30 course , was a step up in distance to seven furlongs , or 1,400 meters , but it proved no obstacle for @entity36 's mount as she pulled away from the field in the closing stages of the race			0
foaled in 2006 , the five - year - old bay had only been lightly - raced in her two , three and four - year - old seasons , but she has been busier this campaign with connections now aiming for the glamor @entity45 at @entity46 for her first foray on @entity49 soil			1
although a specialist over the shorter distances of 1,000 and 1,200 meters , the step up for the @entity13 was thought to be an attempt to prepare her for the undulating @entity46 turf , although the @entity45 will be contested over six -- not seven -- furlongs			0
the presence of the world 's top - rated sprinter at @entity46 's showpiece event -- renamed , in 2012 , in honor of the @entity62 's landmark jubilee -- is a mouth - watering prospect for @entity49 's most prestigious race course			0
" running the race with the world 's top - rated sprinter , @entity1 , representing @entity6 in what is historically @entity72 's most international race would be a wonderful way to begin a new era for the @entity45 , " said an @entity46 spokesman			1
@entity1 is something of a celebrity in her native @entity6 , where thousands of punters regularly pack the stands to see her race , many wearing her traditional salmon and black colors in tribute			1
her success has sparked a media frenzy in the sports - mad nation , with the country regularly grinding to a halt when her races are shown on tv -- local networks even broke into coverage of last month 's @entity95 tennis championships to broadcast her 17th race			2
the trip to @entity98 raises the prospect of a future showdown with top - rated colt @entity101 , also unbeaten in all nine of his starts			0
the four - year - old is the only horse in the world with a higher official rating than @entity1			1
the sir @entity109 - trained powerhouse out of champion sire @entity107 is almost as big a star in @entity49 as @entity1 is @entity112			2
however , connections for both horses remain tight - tipped about the possibility of a match race			0
@entity101 aside , all eyes in the @entity1 camp are surely trained on the ultimate prize of @entity46 , with a possible stopover in the @entity121 en route for the @entity123 also thought to be on the cards			0
but first @entity1 must overcome her next immediate challenge : saturday 's meet could pit her once again against her principal rival , @entity129 -- the only horse who has given her a run for her money so far in @entity6 , and a top sprinter in his own right			1
in addition to @entity129 , a clutch of exciting three - year - olds entered for the @entity24 will also be looking to stop the @entity1 juggernaut in its tracks			1
just do n't bet against lightning striking twice			0
with @entity1 proving herself over seven furlongs , do you think a clash with @entity101 could be on the cards ? who would win ?			2

@entity6 racehorse @entity1 is a sensation in her *homeland*
the five - year - old mare has won all 18 races she has entered
@entity1 's latest win came at the @entity13 in @entity14 on saturday
this *weekend* she will try to make it *19* wins in the @entity24
