@entity0 -- @entity1 has reported president @entity2 has personally met with four leading candidates for the upcoming @entity5 vacancy			2
the president is expected to announce his nominee in coming days so the @entity8 can complete the confirmation process in time for the new @entity5 session in the fall			1
justice @entity12 , who turned 90 last month , announced that he will retire shortly after the @entity5 's term ends in late june			2
here are summaries of the four people believed to be finalists for the @entity12 seat , and a list of arguments for and against their nominations : @entity21 @entity23 solicitor general year born : 1960 hometown : @entity24 ( @entity25 ) experience : solicitor general ; @entity28 dean ; @entity30 associate counsel education : @entity33 ; @entity34 ; @entity35 , @entity28 fun fact : former law clerk for @entity38 , who nicknamed her " shorty " top cases argued as solicitor general ( in support of federal laws or executive action ) : campaign finance reform ( @entity46 v. @entity47 , 2009 ) : congressional efforts to restrict " independent spending " by corporations and unions in federal political campaigns			1
@entity5 ruled against the government in january			2
terror support ( @entity55 , 2010 ) : whether the government 's power to criminalize " material support " of a terrorist organization goes too far in restricting civil liberties			0
religious monuments ( @entity63 v. @entity64 , 2009 ) : can a war memorial shaped like a cross remain on government parkland , or does it violate the constitutional separation of church and state ? justices ruled for the government , saying the cross should remain			0
why she may be chosen : her lack of a substantive paper trail on hot - button issues may blunt initial conservative criticism over where she stands on these topics			0
she has a reputation as a political pragmatist and consensus - builder who enjoys the support of liberal and conservative academics			1
that perceived ability to reach across the aisle could help @entity21 on a divided high court			1
her relative youth ( she would be the youngest member of the court ) could give @entity2 a longer judicial legacy			1
she also would provide greater gender diversity to the bench			1
why she may be passed over : that lack of judicial experience may raise concerns about whether she would be a " reliable " vote on the left			2
some liberal groups have also raised concerns that @entity21 -- as solicitor general -- has articulated a more robust defense of executive power by the @entity30 than many civil rights and human rights groups would like			1
judge @entity105 7th @entity23 @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 year born : 1950 hometowns : @entity110 , @entity111 ; @entity112 , @entity113 experience : @entity115 appeals judge ; @entity118 law professor ; government lawyer in the @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 administrations education : @entity125 , @entity35 , @entity126 fun fact : talented oboe player who plays in local orchestras top cases as federal appeals judge : abortion protests ( @entity133 , 2001 ) : wrote the opinion allowing extortion and anti-racketeering ( @entity136 ) laws to be used against a group of anti-abortion protesters			1
the case was reversed twice by the @entity5 , 8 - 1 and 8 - 0			0
@entity142 ( @entity143 v. @entity144 , 2004 ) -- dissented in a case that ruled a convicted sex offender could be banned from an @entity149 city 's parks			0
the offender admitted observing minors there but left without molesting them			0
religious displays ( @entity154 v. @entity155 and @entity156 , 2008 ) : disagreed in a ruling allowing a condominium association to prevent a @entity107 family from putting up a @entity161 decoration on their doorpost			0
her strong dissent prompted @entity167 's entire court to reconsider , which then reversed and adopted her views on the issue			2
why she may be chosen : @entity173 intellect and consensus - building skills have served her well on a court dominated by conservative judges			2
her gender , @entity178 base , non-ivy league education and long academic record would bring diversity to the high court			1
she also would be the only protestant on the bench			0
@entity167 's working mother status would be seen as a political plus for a @entity30 courting female voters			2
why she may be passed over : her judicial record on abortion , religion and immigration cases could present serious roadblocks			1
conservatives have privately said she would be the least acceptable of the top contenders , and vow a political fight over her nomination			2
her age ( she turns 60 on july 4 ) also could hurt her chances			0
judge @entity200 @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity0 year born : 1952 hometown : @entity107 experience : @entity115 appeals judge ; @entity206 lawyer in the @entity208 and @entity122 administrations education : @entity125 , @entity35 , @entity28 fun facts : @entity212 president @entity211 as a 17 - year - old high school student as part of @entity215			1
later , as a top government lawyer , supervised the prosecution of the @entity219 bombing and @entity221 defendants			0
top cases as federal appeals judge : terror detentions ( @entity225 v. @entity226 , 2008 ) : wrote opinion that concluded the government improperly classified a @entity230 detainee as an enemy combatant			0
discrimination ( @entity233 v. @entity234 , 2004 ) : allowed a @entity0 , government worker to sue for disability discrimination			0
he was supported in the ruling by then - colleague and good friend @entity239 , now chief justice			0
@entity242 ( @entity241 v. @entity243 , 2003 ) : parted ways with @entity239 by refusing to rehear a case over federal protection for the rare arroyo toad , and sided against a @entity249 developer who challenged the @entity250			0
why he may be chosen : little controversy is noted in his personal and professional lives			0
colleagues call him a brilliant legal mind , well - respected by nearly everyone			0
he is viewed as a liberal moderate , and many conservative activists say they could support his nomination			1
that tacit endorsement could erase any protracted political fight , if the @entity30 seeks a smooth , swift confirmation			1
why he may be passed over : many liberals question his ideological credentials , and fear that as the replacement for the left - leaning @entity12 , @entity200 could move the court incrementally to the right on a number of key issues			1
he would add little diversity to the court , being a white male with an @entity274 background			1
judge @entity275 @entity276 , @entity277 , @entity249 ; he is based in @entity278 , @entity279 year born : 1953 hometown : @entity280 , @entity279 experience : @entity115 appeals judge ; private attorney education : @entity285 ; @entity35 , @entity286 fun fact : enjoys skiing and hiking with his wife and two sons , friends say top cases as federal appeals judge : strip searches ( @entity296 and @entity277 , 2006 ) : wrote opinion striking down @entity277 's body - cavity strip search policy for all newly arrested inmates			1
full appeals court later reversed			2
student rights ( @entity302 v. @entity301 , 2006 ) : supported a @entity305 high school that banned a student from wearing a t - shirt reading " homosexuality is shameful , " saying such expressions are disruptive and that gay students and school personnel have a right to be free of such messages , especially in school campus settings			0
terror prevention ( @entity316 v. @entity317 , 2009 ) : dissented in this national security case , where the majority said federal regulators could not be ordered to require greater safety measures at nuclear power plants			0
the commission " owes the public a rational and reasonable explanation why it would exclude from its [ safety ] rule consideration of terrorist air attacks , " @entity275 said			1
why he may be chosen : @entity331 roots would add real regional diversity to the court , and his home - state education may be seen as a plus for a bench dominated by @entity338 leaguers			1
@entity339 is known about him inside the @entity340 , but colleagues praise his low - key demeanor , plain - talking intelligence and quiet sense of humor			0
why he may be passed over : on a court with a majority of five white males , @entity275 would not add much diversity , if the president deems that an important quality			1
his low profile may not give him many strong supporters among the president 's closest aides			0
friends privately say @entity275 himself is downplaying his chances , and that he is surprised just to be considered among the finalists and to have had a personal meeting with @entity2 on the vacancy			1
@entity1 political research director @entity362 contributed to this report .			2

@entity21 known as a political pragmatist , but lacks judicial record
confirmation battle for @entity105 might be tough
@entity200 viewed as a liberal moderate
@entity275 ' @entity331 roots would add regional diversity to the court
