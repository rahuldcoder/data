@entity0 -- predictions of super @entity4 - fueled campaign ugliness seemed to come to reality on thursday when reports broke of a potential conservative group 's ad campaign aimed at tying president @entity9 to a controversy many thought put to rest nearly four years ago			1
but conservative billionaire @entity12 decided against a recommendation from @entity15 strategists that would bring up once again @entity9 's association with the controversial rev. @entity17 , a super pac director said			1
@entity17 , who once ran the church that @entity9 attended in @entity19 , became a central figure in the 2008 election when videos emerged showing some of the pastor 's provocative statements involving race relations in the @entity26			1
@entity9 was eventually forced to distance himself from @entity17 to help spare his political image			1
the proposal to bring @entity17 back into campaign dialogue , a plan first reported by the @entity31 , quickly became the story of the day			2
after hours of backlash from both @entity15 and @entity34 , @entity12 , commissioner of the ad campaign and founder of the brokerage firm @entity38 -- and whose family owns the @entity41 baseball team -- said the plan was merely one of several proposals his group was considering			1
@entity45 , who heads the conservative super pac supported by @entity12 , said @entity12 would not approve the scheme , as it " reflects an approach to politics that mr. @entity12 rejects			1
" " mr. @entity12 intends to work hard to help elect a president this fall who shares his commitment to economic responsibility , but his efforts are and will continue to be focused entirely on questions of fiscal policy , not attacks that seek to divide us socially or culturally , " @entity45 said in a written statement			2
if the super pac , @entity4 , had taken up the plan , it would have attempted to link the president with @entity17 's philosophy , the @entity31 reported			1
titled " the defeat of @entity9 : the @entity70 to end his spending for @entity72 , " the ad campaign was to play off racial undertones and called for what the proposal described as an " extremely literate conservative @entity68 " as its spokesman , according to the @entity31			1
the spokesman would make the case that @entity9 misleadingly portrayed himself in 2008 as a " metrosexual , black @entity75			2
" the campaign would " do exactly what ( sen. ) @entity77 would not let us do , " the @entity31 reported the strategists writing			2
when @entity77 ran against @entity9 in 2008 , the @entity15 nominee famously refrained from pursuing the @entity17 angle and called out supporters at campaign events who mocked @entity9 's middle name , " @entity86			1
" on thursday , @entity77 's former campaign manager , @entity87 , told @entity1 he was " never prouder " to work for @entity77 than when the senator refused to go after @entity9 over @entity17 's comments			1
" it was n't useful			0
and more importantly it 's wrong , " @entity87 said			0
@entity1 contributor @entity93 agreed , saying thursday such an attack would open up a can of worms for @entity15			0
" if the @entity15 , if they want to do that , then guess what , you 're now putting @entity107 on the table , " he said , referring to @entity99 's @entity98 faith -- a factor that has largely remained on the sidelines of this year 's election			0
the presumptive @entity15 nominee 's campaign also came out against such attacks when asked to respond to the report			2
@entity113 argued the economy should remain the primary issue in the race			0
" unlike the @entity9 campaign , gov. @entity99 is running a campaign based on jobs and the economy , and we encourage everyone else to do the same , " @entity99 's campaign manager @entity117 said in a written statement			2
in a press conference later thursday , @entity99 said he " repudiates " any efforts of " character assassination , " arguing @entity9 's campaign has already attempted to take on such tactics			1
hitting back , @entity131 blasted @entity99 's camp for not releasing a stronger statement about the proposed ad campaign			1
" once again , governor @entity99 has fallen short of the standard that @entity77 set , reacting tepidly in a moment that required moral leadership in standing up to the very extreme wing of his own party , " @entity9 campaign manager @entity135 said in a written statement			1
@entity144 spokesman @entity143 later pointed to comments , not only from @entity34 but also @entity15 , suggesting that " to launch a multimillion - dollar divisive attack campaign is not what the @entity26 people want , and i think there are moments when you have to stand up and say that is not the right way to go			0
" thursday 's super pac dust - up calls to mind some of the more nasty campaign tactics used in the @entity15 primaries earlier this year and poses the question of just how involved outside groups will be in stoking the already - heated fight between the @entity99 and @entity9 camps			1
a relatively new addition the political game , super pacs were made possible by a 2010 @entity165 case , known as @entity166 , that ruled in favor of allowing corporations and unions to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money so long as they do not coordinate with the campaigns they support			0
this cycle , super pacs have quickly become one of the defining markers of 2012 , as the groups have played a pivotal role in doing the so - called dirty work for campaigns			0
groups supporting @entity99 and former presidential candidate @entity182 especially made waves in the @entity15 primaries and caucuses			0
the @entity187 super pac @entity186 released a flood of scathing attack ads against @entity190 ahead of the @entity192 primary in late january , less than two weeks after the former @entity144 speaker won the @entity195 primary			2
@entity190 blamed the super @entity4 blitz and the @entity99 campaign ads for his eventual loss in the @entity192			2
the @entity200 group , however , had performed its own share of heavy - hitting when it produced a 30 - minute special about @entity99 's history at @entity203			0
@entity204 , chairman of the political science department at @entity206 in @entity207 , wrote in a @entity1 op - ed this week that while most commentary about @entity166 has been focused on conservative groups , @entity34 will also reap benefits from the gorge of spending			1
" @entity166 also freed up unions to spend unlimited amounts of their money to directly advocate for the election of labor - friendly candidates , usually @entity34 , " @entity204 wrote			0
he added : " whereas conservative leaning groups have so far mainly used their money to fund campaign advertising , the @entity219 and other unions have made it clear that their money will be spent on grass - roots get - out - the - vote activities			0
" indeed , @entity9 's campaign also realized it could benefit from super pac money , despite the president 's vocal opposition to the 2010 @entity165 decision			1
the campaign made headlines when it announced in february that it would begin encouraging donors to give to @entity234 , a super pac supporting @entity9 's re-election bid			1
" this decision was not made overnight , " one campaign official said			0
" the money raised and spent by @entity15 super pacs is very telling			0
we will not unilaterally disarm			0
" @entity234 has reported spending $ 2.1 million this cycle , according to @entity243 reports , and co-purchased an ad buy last week on a negative spot tying @entity99 to big oil			0
while the presidential candidates themselves have been relatively quiet about the role of super pacs this year , former candidate @entity77 has railed hard against outside spending			1
calling @entity166 the " worst decision in the last 50 years , " @entity77 said the @entity165 " basically unleashed -- without transparency and without accountability -- huge amounts of money from these so - called ' independent campaigns			0
' " and earlier this year on @entity1 's " @entity258 with @entity259 , " @entity77 said , " now it 's the system under which we operate , which leads to this kind of campaigning and will lead to corruption and scandals			2
" @entity1 's @entity267 , @entity268 , @entity269 and @entity270 contributed to this report .			0
