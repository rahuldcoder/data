@entity0 -- @entity3 @entity2 are bracing for a rough election night next tuesday , and top leaders are making a major push for rank and file members to open their wallets to help save those vulnerable @entity2 who are in danger of losing their seats			1
@entity16 @entity15 and rep @entity17 , @entity20 - @entity19 , chairman of the @entity22 , held a conference call tuesday afternoon with @entity3 @entity2 and told them it was time to pony up -- and gave them a friday deadline			1
according to a source on the call , a dozen @entity3 members and two @entity22 candidates pledged almost $ 500,000 during the session			1
several @entity22 sources told @entity1 that members are expecting republicans to pick up some seats , but they still believe that many @entity3 @entity2 in competitive districts are positioned to survive if they get support			1
the @entity22 has invested heavily in field operations with 950 staff in 40 districts			1
but the surge of outside money from @entity34 groups on new television and radio spots , combined with contributions from several wealthy @entity34 candidates , has @entity2 concerned			1
in a memo circulated to @entity2 , the @entity22 chairman argued that the uptick in @entity34 spending by outside groups was something the committee was prepared to counter			1
@entity55 wrote that despite the effort by @entity34 and their allies , " not a single @entity22 incumbent is out of contention			2
this is a stark contrast from 2010 , where many incumbents were already down and out despite our best efforts			0
" but @entity55 also said , " this climate is incredibly challenging and only getting harder			0
" so , with seven days left before the midterms , the leaders stepped up the pressure on members to give now			2
the @entity22 has consistently out - raised its @entity34 counterpart over the course of the 2014 election cycle			2
according to the @entity73 , @entity3 @entity2 have raised over $ 172 million for the midterms , while @entity3 @entity34 have raised about $ 131 million			2
for @entity2 , much of the money has been brought in by top leaders like @entity15 , @entity55 and rep @entity76 , the no. 2 @entity3 @entity78			1
the purpose of the call on tuesday was to make it clear that they expect others , especially those who were given plum committee posts by their leaders , to lend a hand			0
there are always members in both parties who sit on money in their campaign accounts at the end of an election cycle			0
some of these members might be considering a bid for the @entity96 or governor , or may be reluctant to share the cash with their colleagues			0
but the ones who spent hours hosting fundraisers and trekking over to the @entity22 headquarters to dial donors for dollars are frustrated with colleagues who do n't reach their targets and do n't seem to suffer major repercussions			2
according to a @entity22 dues sheet obtained by @entity1 , about 90 % of @entity3 @entity2 have contributed to the campaign committee , but 77 -- less than half of the @entity112 -- have paid the full amount of dues for the 2014 midterms			1
leaders were expected to raise between $ 450,000 and $ 800,000 for this cycle , and data from the @entity22 shows 37 @entity3 @entity2 exceeded their goals			1
democrats on key committees overseeing banks , telecommunications companies , and other industries who donate to campaigns are also expected to raise significant money -- between $ 200,000 and $ 500,000 per election cycle , depending on their committee and seniority			0
but the 2013 - 2014 dues sheet shows many of those committee leaders fell short on their fundraising goals			0
for example , @entity134 , who is the top @entity78 on the tax writing committee , gave $ 525,000 -- more than his assigned $ 500,000			0
but @entity138 @entity137 , who is the most senior @entity78 on the @entity140 panel , and a close ally of @entity15 's , has sent in $ 10,000 of his $ 500,000 in dues			0
@entity137 's office did not respond to an inquiry from @entity1			0
@entity146 tallies of members ' campaign contributions are regularly shared among @entity3 democrats			0
making sure fellow @entity2 see the spreadsheets that show who is paying up and who is n't is a tool leaders hope will shame those who have n't given significant amounts yet to write checks			1
but it 's also a list leaders keep in mind when they decide who gets to keep slots on powerful committees in the next @entity162 .			0

@entity22 leaders seek campaign donations from rank and file representatives
