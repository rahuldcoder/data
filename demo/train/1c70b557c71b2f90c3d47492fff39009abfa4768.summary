-- some analysts have attributed the recent downing of a @entity5 @entity4 high - altitude reconnaissance drone in @entity6 to that nation 's increasingly sophisticated capability to launch cyber attacks			1
others have dismissed the idea that @entity6 was capable of bringing down an @entity4 , arguing that @entity6 air defenses do not have the capability to track an aircraft with radar - evading technology			0
either way , the incident clearly demonstrates @entity5 concerns regarding @entity6 's nuclear capacity , as the drone was likely sent over @entity6 territory to spy on its nuclear program			1
i find the argument that @entity6 is engaged in developing a nuclear weapons program credible			2
i am also convinced that @entity6 will not test a device , but rather will acquire the capability to produce a weapon quickly if its strategic environment deteriorates to such an extent that it feels it must			2
i am further convinced that an @entity32 or @entity5 strike or strikes against its nuclear facilities would put @entity6 's nuclear program back by a few years but would not be able to terminate it			1
in fact , such strikes would provide @entity39 with the legitimacy to go ahead and acquire nuclear weapons capability in full view of the world and with international sympathy			1
it is time for world leaders to recognize the inevitability of @entity6 acquiring nuclear weapons capability , even if it remains untested , with @entity39 following the policy and adopting the rhetoric of deliberate ambiguity			1
moreover , the major powers that act as the self - appointed guardians of the current international nuclear order need to recognize that treaties and other legal documents are not the primary determinants when it comes to state decisions regarding acquisition of nuclear capability			0
it is a country 's strategic environment that principally determines such a decision			0
@entity6 's strategic environment is such that it makes the decision by @entity6 's policy makers to acquire nuclear weapons appear rational both to themselves and to the wider @entity6 public			1
this is why leading opposition figures are as opposed to suspending uranium enrichment as regime hard - liners			1
the foremost opposition presidential candidate , @entity72 , in an interview with the @entity74 in the run - up to the elections in 2009 , stated categorically : " no one in @entity6 would accept suspension			0
" the strategic rationality of such a policy was recognized in a candid moment by none other than @entity32 's defense minister , @entity83			0
in an appearance on " @entity85 " last month , @entity83 was asked whether he would want to acquire nuclear weapons if he were an @entity6 government minister			1
@entity83 responded very candidly : " probably , probably			0
i know it 's not -- i mean i do n't delude myself that they are doing it just because of @entity32			0
they look around , they see the @entity92 are nuclear , the @entity91 are nuclear , @entity90 is nuclear , not to mention the @entity93			0
" while downplaying the @entity32 nuclear weapons capability , @entity83 neglected to mention that @entity6 's policy makers perceive the @entity5 nuclear and non-nuclear armada in the @entity99 and the @entity100 as the greatest threat to their security			1
all this obviously makes for a dangerous strategic environment as far as @entity39 is concerned , regardless of the nature of the @entity6 regime			0
the @entity5 decision to invade non-nuclear @entity108 while desisting from militarily confronting a nuclear @entity109 surely tells @entity6 's rulers that even rudimentary nuclear capability can deter potential @entity5 and allied designs to attack @entity6 , whether to topple its regime or impair its nuclear capacity			1
given the near - certainty that @entity6 is launched on an irreversible course for nuclear weapons capacity , there are only two strategies that can be used -- if not to stop the nuclear program , then at least to make it less threatening to @entity5 interests			2
the first is for the @entity5 to actively promote the idea of a nuclear weapon - free zone ( @entity125 ) for the @entity126 that would include both @entity32 and @entity6			2
@entity6 has supported calls for a @entity125 for several years , most recently at a @entity128 it hosted in april 2010 , as long as it included @entity32 as well as @entity6			0
however , promoting a @entity125 in the @entity126 does not appear realistic for the @entity5 in the short run because @entity32 is stubbornly opposed to it before a permanent solution is found to the @entity32 - @entity132 conflict			2
furthermore , domestic constraints , including a highly @entity134 , would not allow the @entity5 administration to seriously pursue this course			0
the other option is to accept @entity6 's status as a near - nuclear power and engage it in substantive discussions about the future architecture of regional security in the broader @entity126 , and more specifically in the @entity99 , where @entity6 is the indispensable power			1
this would entail a drastic revision of the current @entity5 strategy of isolating and quarantining @entity6 , and replacing it with one that accommodates @entity6 's regional aspirations and attempts to find areas of convergence rather than confrontation with @entity39			2
the @entity5 approach to @entity92 in the 1990s and the 2000s could form the model for such a policy			0
such a change of course is likely to pose a major but not insuperable challenge to @entity5 policy makers , given the current atmosphere of mutual hostility surrounding @entity164 's relations with @entity39			1
it would require creative diplomacy on the part of the @entity168 and the @entity169 , including signaling @entity6 that the @entity5 recognizes its pre-eminent status in the @entity99 ( much as @entity164 did with @entity92 in @entity171 ) and the legitimate role that goes with it			0
it will also mean reducing the paranoia currently afflicting @entity6 's policy makers because of their fear of encirclement by nuclear powers			1
if this means that the international community has to learn to live with a near - nuclear @entity6 , then this is the price it must be willing to pay for stability and security in this crucial region			0
as recent experience has demonstrated , economic sanctions and military threats are only likely to stiffen the @entity6 resolve to acquire nuclear weapons as well as to act as the " spoiler " not only in the energy - rich @entity99 but also in the strategically important broader @entity126 region			1
furthermore , @entity5 hostility toward @entity6 reinforces the domestic legitimacy of the @entity6 regime and discredits the democratic opposition , an outcome that is not in the long - term interest of the @entity5			2
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity199 .			0

@entity199 : @entity6 inevitably will acquire nuclear weapons capability
even @entity6 's opposition leaders oppose suspending uranium enrichment , he says
@entity199 : @entity5 must engage @entity6 in discussions about security in the @entity126
such a change of course would pose a challenge to @entity5 policy makers , he says
