the tense , high - stakes standoff between @entity1 and @entity2 continued tuesday , with both sides insisting they do n't want war but publicly offering little evidence of their willingness to budge			1
@entity7 , a @entity1 parliamentarian who has been charged with leading negotiations with the new government of @entity10 -- a disputed region thought to be threatened by a @entity2 takeover -- told @entity14 's @entity13 that " today we ( had ) the first sign of contact between our minister of defense and @entity2 's minister of defense , " as well as talks involving other ministers			1
" but it is not a negotiation , unfortunately , " said @entity7 , a billionaire businessman and former @entity1 foreign minister			0
" we try to do our best to use any opportunity for peaceful negotiation			0
but ... we do n't have any sign of hope ... from the @entity2 side			0
" the comments are the latest indicating @entity1 officials ' attempts to peacefully prevent a full - scale war over the @entity10 peninsula , which had been part of @entity2 until it was ceded to @entity1 in 1954 by @entity37 leader @entity36			1
@entity38 , @entity1 's @entity39 ambassador , claimed @entity2 used planes , boats and helicopters to flood the peninsula with 16,000 troops			1
and @entity1 officials say disguised @entity2 troops have laid siege to military installations			1
yet @entity2 president @entity48 on tuesday denied sending members of his military into @entity10 or that any of the up to 25,000 @entity2 troops already stationed in the country had any role in the standoff , according to the state - run @entity56 news agency			1
he insisted his military is n't planning to seize the @entity10 peninsula -- but did n't close the door on action " to protect local people			2
" should @entity2 troops intervene , @entity48 said , " it will be legitimate and correspond to international law because we have a direct request from a legitimate president and it corresponds to our interests in protecting people who are close to us			1
" @entity7 said ousted @entity1 president @entity68 , who fled to @entity2 last week after months of public unrest against his government that ultimately boiled over into violence , has no legitimacy			2
that includes having no right to ask @entity2 to send troops into @entity1 to restore him to what he feels is his rightful post as president , according to @entity7 , who insisted only @entity81 can invite foreign troops			1
" his ( political tenure ) is finished , and he is a criminal , " said @entity7 , " especially after yesterday 's appeal to have foreign troops come here and start a war			0
" tension , uncertainty in @entity10 while no blood has been spilled between the @entity1 and @entity2 militaries , no one is breathing easy -- especially amid reports of @entity1 military facilities in @entity10 being under siege			1
on sunday , a @entity96 official said @entity2 forces have " complete operational control " of @entity10			1
and @entity48 said tuesday " local militias " -- who , he insisted , do n't answer to @entity103 -- control up to 22,000 @entity1 army troops and their heavy military equipment			1
@entity7 , the @entity1 official , said that while military units have been " blocked , " they have not relinquished control			1
" our soldiers ( are ) demonstrating a strong spirit , " he added , commending them for not opening fire			0
sounds and images from the ground showcase the tension -- and confusion			0
several hundred men wearing dark green camouflage uniforms without insignias surrounded @entity1 's @entity121 base sunday near the @entity10 capital of @entity123			2
but rather than the standoff , they walked peacefully near 15 @entity1 troops standing guard			2
by tuesday , the situation remained tense , and the base was still surrounded			0
but the base commander moved in and out , and troops outside were n't stopping anyone			0
but not every scene was so calm			0
@entity133 showed more than 100 unarmed @entity1 troops trying tuesday morning to return to @entity136 air base north of @entity137 , only to have @entity2 forces fire warning shots over their heads			2
a @entity2 voice tells the @entity1 he has orders to shoot them in the legs if they advance			2
the @entity1 commander reports they have no weapons , and the @entity2 are in control			2
after some negotiations , 15 @entity1 troops are let in			2
by contrast , about 12 miles ( 20 kilometers ) southeast of @entity123 , about 100 @entity2 troops on tuesday parked their vehicles at a @entity1 military base , excavated mini-trenches and erected mess tents -- all while having civil conversations with @entity1 troops and moving about freely			2
what 's happening on the @entity2 side of the @entity1 border , though , may end up being more significant			2
@entity48 ordered about 150,000 @entity2 troops who had been taking part in military exercises near the border back to their barracks			2
but that order did n't involve troops already in @entity10 , nor did it reassure @entity1 's new interim leadership based in the capital of @entity170			1
@entity2 troops and vehicles remain near the country 's eastern border , according to @entity1 officials			1
@entity176 , head of @entity1 's @entity177 , told @entity81 that @entity1 doubled its security presence at checkpoints along the border			0
as the governments jostle , @entity1 citizens are in limbo			0
@entity184 , from the coastal city of @entity186 , said he is worried about being cut off from gas , electricity or the @entity189 , as well as the prospect of living under @entity2 rule			0
but he admits not everyone shares his opinion ; even in his own family , one of his sisters wants a plan to get out while another sister sides completely with @entity2			0
" the worst feeling is that i feel unsure about what will be tomorrow , " @entity184 said			0
" my thoughts are : this wo n't end fast			0
" @entity204 : @entity96 ' will stand by the @entity1 people ' diplomatic efforts to end the crisis bore little fruit tuesday			1
@entity7 , who is heading @entity1 's efforts to forge a peaceful resolution over @entity10 , said his government is " constantly trying to " have conversations with @entity103			2
" we think that , without any negotiating ... the escalation process and the temperature on the @entity10 is rising up , " he added			0
@entity218 chancellor @entity217 is trying to construct what a senior @entity96 administration official characterized as an " off - ramp " for @entity48 by having international observers in @entity10 to ensure ethnic @entity2 ' rights are n't violated			1
president @entity224 floated this idea in a call saturday with @entity48 , and he and @entity217 talked about it tuesday			0
@entity229 members are set to meet wednesday with @entity2 's ambassador to the alliance , which gathered in emergency session amid @entity234 's fears that any potential conflict could spread around the region			1
@entity229 secretary general @entity237 said tuesday that despite repeated calls by the international community , " @entity2 continues to violate @entity1 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and continues to violate its international commitments			1
" there 's no indication yet @entity229 will intervene militarily , but its members may take action other ways			0
that includes actions targeting @entity103 ( like @entity255 prime minister @entity254 announcing the cancellation of military activities involving his and @entity2 's militaries ) , punitive measures like sanctions against @entity1 individuals or groups or helping prop up that nation 's shaky economy			1
to that latter point , @entity1 's @entity81 ratified a deal tuesday to receive loans from the @entity264 worth 610 million euros , the equivalent of nearly $ 839 million			0
representatives of the @entity267 were headed to the country to begin inspections ahead of a possible financial deal			0
and @entity96 secretary of state @entity204 has announced a $ 1 billion loan guarantee for @entity1			1
@entity204 visited @entity170 on tuesday , laying flowers in honor of slain protesters at @entity275 , or @entity275 , and accusing @entity2 of making up reasons to intervene militarily			1
" not a single piece of credible evidence " supports @entity2 explanations for its move into @entity10 , said the top @entity96 diplomat			1
he added , " @entity2 has talked about @entity2 - speaking citizens being under siege			0
" @entity285 prefers a peaceful resolution to this crisis , @entity204 said			0
but if that does n't happen -- and @entity2 steps up its military involvement -- " our partners will have absolutely no choice ( but ) to join us to continue to expand on steps we have taken in recent days to isolate @entity2 diplomatically , politically and economically			0
" " the @entity96 will stand by the @entity1 people as they build the strong democratic country they deserve , " @entity204 said			1
" ... we must all step up and answer their call			0
