@entity1 , @entity0 -- if you had to describe one @entity6 actress as " heavyweight " @entity3 would be a pretty strong contender for the title			1
pulling no punches : streep as fiercely caustic nun , @entity12 in @entity14 's 1960s morality drama " doubt			2
" over 30 years in the movie business the actress has pulled no punches , receiving an incredible 15 @entity20 nominations , and winning twice , for " @entity21 " in 1982 and " @entity22 " in 1979			2
even so , " @entity15 " director @entity14 says was knocked sideways by @entity3 's " tooth and nail " performance in his @entity20 - nominated drama , " doubt , " describing himself as " quite astonished			1
" streep , who has been nominated for a @entity27 at this year 's @entity20 for her role , stars as fiercely caustic nun , @entity12 , the iron - gloved principal of a religious school in a working class @entity36 neighborhood in the 1960s			1
" @entity3 really wanted to do the role because , i think , she thought it was really right for her , " @entity14 told @entity2 in a recent interview , adding , " i have to say i was quite astonished at her amazing facility			1
" but it was the rapport between @entity3 and oscar - winner @entity44 who plays @entity45 that was central to getting the story across			1
@entity14 says their relationship was electric			2
all he had to do was put them on set and wait for the sparks to fly			0
" the set became like the ring that prizefighters go into , " recalls @entity14			1
" they would just sit in their respective corners when they were n't shooting , with their heads hanging down , in some private universe of some very , very tormented place , and get ready to do that scene			0
" and then when they were called to do it , they would get in there and the walls would shake			0
" @entity14 approached @entity3 first when he was casting the film , but knew he would need to find a formidable actor to play the @entity45 , which is why he chose @entity44 -- " the smartest guy that chose to become an actor that i 've ever met			1
" " i knew that when i closed my eyes , i did n't know what he would do with the role , " @entity14 told @entity2 , " i knew that if i did n't know then @entity3 would n't know and that would keep her on her toes			2
" @entity44 's portrayal of @entity45 , the modern - thinking humanist whose progressive sermons and personal habits -- like an enjoyment of three sugars in his tea -- rankle austere @entity12 , has won him an @entity20 nomination for best supporting actor			1
the story is set in the @entity92 , @entity36 in 1964 just after the @entity94 assassination and on the cusp of the civil rights movement -- a time of social flux			0
it centers on a moral crusade sister @entity12 launches against @entity45 who she suspects of taking an unhealthy interest in @entity102 , his altar boy and the school 's only black student			0
the film begins with a simple question : did he or did n't he ? the ensuing battle between @entity12 and @entity45 is old against new with religious , ethical , political , gender and racial elements all thrown into the mix. the power of the drama is all in the dialogue , especially the confrontations between @entity12 and @entity45			0
the beauty of the story is that it does not answer any of the questions			0
ireport.com : @entity119 thinks @entity3 will win @entity14 's mantra during filming was to never lead the audience to any one conclusion , allowing people to view the tale through the reflection of their own biases			1
it was hard to get this delicate balance in emotionally intense scenes but , says @entity14 , with actors of @entity3 and @entity44 's caliber his approach was to use a very light touch			1
" it 's often just nuance , " he told @entity2 , explaining how he and @entity3 worked together while filming one of the film 's confrontations			2
" we were in the middle of it and @entity3 was going with @entity44 tooth and nail and she got very sarcastic with him			2
" and i said ' cut ' and said ' ok , we have that			0
now let 's do it again and this time take the high road			0
' " " and she did every single thing differently and yet within character and she took the high road at every turn			0
" he says @entity44 takes direction in a completely different way			0
" with @entity44 , you give him information and it goes through a pipeline about a quarter mile long and then it shows up , and how it shows up , i do n't know			0
" i do n't know what that process is exactly			0
he 's a very internalized actor but he hears everything you say and he makes his adjustments accordingly			0
" " @entity15 " is based on a @entity167 - winning and @entity166 - winning play also written by @entity14 , which the director adapted for the big screen			1
@entity14 , who won an @entity20 for @entity171 in 1988 for " @entity172 , " has been nominated for @entity173			1
as well as @entity3 and @entity44 's , there are best supporting actress nominations for @entity176 who plays a mouse - like , innocent nun who teaches at the school , @entity179 , and stage actress @entity180 who plays @entity102 's mother .			1
