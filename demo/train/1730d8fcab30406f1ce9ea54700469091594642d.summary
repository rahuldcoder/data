" the two presidents agreed to hold combined military exercises and enhanced training in the days ahead to continue the close security cooperation between our two countries , and to underscore the strength of our alliance and commitment to peace and security in the region , " the statement said			0
@entity1 's @entity11 said " indiscriminate attacks on civilians are a grave matter			1
" he said that , since " @entity4 maintains an offensive posture , " @entity1 's military forces -- the army , air force and navy -- " should unite and retaliate against [ the @entity4 's ] provocation with multiple-fold firepower			1

after the incident , @entity16 said the @entity0 government " banned its nationals from entering the communist state , indefinitely postponed scheduled @entity118 talks and began looking at ways to push the @entity120 to condemn @entity7			2
" @entity1 also suspended promised flood aid to @entity4 , @entity16 reported , citing an unnamed official			1
@entity4 said the incident stemmed from @entity1 maritime military exercises , code named @entity126 , and called the exercises " war maneuvers for a war of aggression			1
" the " @entity1 puppet group " engaged in " reckless military provocation " by firing " dozens of shells " inside its territorial waters " despite the repeated warnings of the @entity4 " or @entity4 , the @entity4 's military said in a statement			1
" the revolutionary armed forces of the @entity4 standing guard over the inviolable territorial waters of the country took such a decisive military step as reacting to the military provocation of the puppet group with a prompt powerful physical strike , " the statement said			1

" the subject did , of course , come up in my meetings with the @entity168 @entity176			0
i think we both share the view that such conflict is very undesirable			0
i expressed to them the desire that restraint be exercised on all sides , and i think we agree on that			0
" " we call on all members of the international community to condemn the @entity4 's acts and to make clear that they expect the @entity4 to cease all provocations and implement its denuclearization commitments , " @entity161 told reporters in @entity165 on wednesday			2
the incident comes a few days after a @entity43 scientist reported that @entity4 has built a new uranium enrichment facility			2
@entity4 officials said the facility is producing low - enriched uranium , said @entity196 , co-director of the @entity197 at @entity198			0
the enrichment facility contains 2,000 centrifuges and appears to be designed for nuclear power production , " not to boost @entity4 's military capability , " @entity196 said			1
but @entity43 and @entity1 diplomats said the revelation confirms the country 's long - term deceit			1
sanctions have been progressively placed on @entity4 in response to a succession of nuclear and missile tests and the sinking of the @entity1 warship in march			2
the @entity43 said it would not dismiss restarting six - party talks aimed at denuclearizing the @entity4			2

" the secretary and the minister agreed their departments should consult closely and coordinate on any response to this act of aggression by the @entity4 , " he added			0
@entity43 rep. @entity248 , the @entity85 @entity249 leader who 's in line to become the next speaker , said he joined @entity67 in condemning @entity4 's " hostile action			1
" @entity254 deputy spokesman @entity253 said the @entity43 would work with its partners in the six - party talks " to take a deliberate , slow approach to responding to this latest provocation			2
" he would n't respond to criticism that the current policy is a failure , or at the very least , not working well			0
" it 's hard ; it 's another setback , " he said			0
" i think that everybody involved is stunned by @entity4 's provocative actions			2

" " relevant facts need to be verified , and we hope both parties make more contributions to the stability of the peninsula , " he said			0
a @entity43 official with knowledge of @entity43 strategy on @entity4 says it may be time to adjust @entity43 military policy in the region			1
while the exercises " are designed to deter further provocative behavior by @entity4 , obviously it 's not working , " the official said			2
" when we announced joint military exercises in the @entity34 , it only angered @entity168			2
and in other waters , it does n't seem to be effective deterrence against the @entity4			0
" @entity290 , director of the @entity291 , the @entity292 , called the act a " very serious provocation			0
" " it also signals dissatisfaction with the @entity297 relationship and an apparent willingness to keep @entity297 tensions high			0
the incident could reflect a more aggressive view of what a nuclear @entity4 thinks it can do without facing a broader escalation of tensions			0
" journalist @entity304 and @entity2 's @entity305 , @entity306 and @entity307 contributed to this report .			0
