-- a couple with fish bowls instead of heads			2
a magician who can make cards fly in a perfect spiral			0
these images have to be real , our brains tell us			0
that 's the amazing thing about photography , says @entity12 : if the light falls on the object just the right way , if the shadows line up naturally , our brains allow us to believe the unbelievable			1
it 's the guiding concept that drives 32 - year - old @entity18 , a conceptual photographer in @entity20 , @entity21 , who has been recreating his dream fragments in a six - year series called the " @entity25			1
the project has appeared in the @entity27 in several cities			0
@entity18 considers himself more of a photographer than a manipulator			1
he shoots all the elements of his photos on location at the same time under the same lighting to achieve the best optic effects			1
he then uses @entity38 's photoshop editing program to layer the images together and mask objects as needed to create the illusions			1
analyzing the dream and figuring out how to execute the vision in the real world takes much longer than the photo editing , though that part of the process can also take many days , he says			1
" surrealism in my view is not simply @entity51 or photographic technique , " he says			0
" the most important in my mind is the intention , or the concept you want to convey			0
it 's not about levitation or multiplication of objects -- those are just tools i happen to use to convey deeper concepts i find to be interesting			1
" sharing his work and deconstructing it for other photographers is a key part of his art. @entity18 , who studied script writing at @entity70 , learned about photography while on reserve duty for the @entity21 army			1
art photography : when ' reality is n't good enough ' " most of what i know today i learned from @entity78 resources , starting from shutter speeds and apertures , basic functions of the camera , to composition and @entity51 techniques			1
i bought my first camera and lens with the help from a guy i have never met , " he said			0
" i basically look at hundreds of photos every day from around the world and try to learn what i like			2
" @entity18 uses his blog to take the audience behind the scenes of his photos , deconstructing the image or explaining where the props came from			2
he made a music video from the shoot where a woman is lying on a bed surrounded by iguanas , one of his favorite images from the series			0
that one , which represents a fear of relationships , was shot in his bedroom in @entity20			0
there was actually only one iguana , and the girl really is in bed with the lizard			0
" i did all the lighting preparation beforehand and we just went along and placed the iguana on different spots on the bed			0
it started moving and that was kind of scary for her , but it was fine , and he got very relaxed afterward , " @entity12 said			1
" then i layered those photos , like 30 different layers , and made that image			2
" this week @entity18 posted a batch of his photos on @entity133 , the social news site where members create and run their own forums on topics of their choice and user clicks determine the popularity of posts			2
he agreed to post them on @entity142			0
the surreal photos were a hit on @entity133 -- his link made it onto the site 's front page -- and @entity18 stayed up all night answering questions about where his ideas come from , how he remembers them , and his techniques for composing certain images			1
what the brain draws from : art and neuroscience some photos , like his depiction of a woman lying upside down on a staircase , and a man rappelling down the wall , require little editing -- just creative angles and a discretely positioned step - stool , he explained			1
" i do n't love telling everything , just for the reason of the effect on people -- like when a magician does something , you really do n't want to know -- but if it helps an actual photographer to go out and do cool stuff , i 'm for it , " he says			2
" it 's not like it 's a big secret about what i 'm doing			2
" want to try ? @entity12 has an assignment for you : take a photo of yourself using one element you can recall from a dream , using any type of camera or phone			1
the photo needs to tell the story of the dream , or part of it			2
in the caption , write what you remember from the dream			0
" if you do n't like the result , do it again until you do , " @entity12 says			1
" be prepared for the possibility of it being misunderstood or deemed a failure			0
it might just turn out to be the best thing you have ever done , and interest a whole bunch of people			0
" upload your photo to @entity142 and it could be featured on @entity0 .			0

photographer @entity12 recreates his dreams through photos
he 's *inspired* by surrealist *painters* @entity213 and others
sharing the process is a key part of his art
