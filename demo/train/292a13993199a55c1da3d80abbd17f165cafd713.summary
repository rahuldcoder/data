@entity0 -- a cruise ship attendant claimed in a federal lawsuit that @entity4 sexually assaulted him during a @entity7 cruise in 2009 , according to court documents filed last week			1
@entity10 , who said he was assigned to be @entity4 's personal attendant , accused the actor of " harmful and offensive contact " by " removing his bath robe , grabbing plaintiff 's hand , and forcing his naked person and erect penis against plaintiff 's person , " the complaint said			1
" this is another ludicrous lawsuit with inane claims , " @entity4 lawyer @entity22 said			1
" it is obvious that mr. @entity10 and his lawyers are looking for their 15 minutes of fame			0
" another lawsuit , filed by two male massage therapists in april , accused @entity4 of sexual assault at hotels in @entity0 and @entity32			1
those plaintiffs withdrew their suit after firing their lawyer and hiring @entity0 attorney @entity36 to handle their case			2
@entity36 said at the time she was considering refiling their complaints in another court			0
@entity36 sued over @entity4 accusers @entity22 called those charges " ridiculous " and denied media reports the actor had considered paying to settle the lawsuit			1
@entity10 's suit , filed thursday in @entity47 in @entity0 , claims the sexual assault happened on board the @entity51 ship @entity52 in june 2009			1
the actor came on to the personal room attendant after he delivered food to his room , the suit said			2
@entity4 complained of a pain in his neck and asked @entity10 to touch it			2
as @entity10 approached , @entity4 dropped his bathrobe and " became completely naked , " the suit said			1
" @entity4 proceeded to forcefully embrace plaintiff , " it said , " causing plaintiff to continue to experience pain , shock , embarrassment , distress and fear			2
" he then told @entity10 " that he was beautiful and asked plaintiff to ' take me , i will take care of you , please , ' " the complaint said			0
when @entity10 asked to be released from the embrace , " @entity4 maintained a hard and painful grasp on plaintiff 's hands , " the suit said			1
the suit described the contact as " nonconsensual , inappropriate , extreme , and outrageous			0
" @entity4 offered @entity10 $ 12,000 for his " discretion and silence , " telling him to return to the suite later that night to collect the money , the suit said			2
instead , @entity10 -- " in a state of pain , shock , embarrassment , distress and fear " -- immediately reported the incident the the ship 's director , human resources manager and a staff captain , the suit said			2
the human resources manager told him to fill out a report , but she " refused to allow plaintiff to write down any information regarding the nudity and / or sexual contact " with @entity4 , the suit said			1
she told him " unless he was bleeding and bruised , he did not suffer any injuries and thus could not obtain treatment or any other type of attention , " it said			0
instead of taking action against @entity4 , the cruise line ordered @entity10 " restrained " in " a segregated room " for five days , until @entity4 was off the ship , the suit said			1
@entity10 claimed he was " persistent " in contacting the cruise line to file a claim against @entity4 for the next two years , but he was repeatedly told it was being filed and to check back later			0
he has since filed an arbitration claim against the company , the suit said			0
a spokesman for the cruise company declined comment			0
@entity10 is seeking unspecified monetary damages to be determined at a trial			0
@entity4 's lawyer said the actor is confident he will " prevail on the merits and that he will be completely vindicated in court			1
" " the lawsuit 's ridiculous claims are completely contradicted by what mr. @entity10 told his employer back in 2009 when he was being disciplined for his own violations of company policy , " @entity22 said			1
" in his handwritten report three years ago , the only physical contact he claimed occurred was allegedly touching my client 's neck			0
the inappropriate conduct he alleges in his lawsuit is absent from his written report he submitted at the time			0
that glaring omission speaks volumes			0
" the fact that @entity10 continued to work for the cruise line for years after " his employer supposedly restrained him in a room on the cruise ship for five days " calls his credibility into question , @entity22 said			0
" now , after waiting three years , and after getting paid to tell his story to the media , mr. @entity10 has filed this absurd lawsuit , " he said			0
@entity10 told his story in tabloid reports published in may , soon after the suit was filed by the two massage therapists			1
@entity4 sexual battery lawsuit withdrawn , but case may go on			2
