-- it 's the elephant in the room of @entity3			1
will @entity4 ever recover from the serious head injury he suffered in a skiing accident six months ago ? the sport has continued its relentless rhythm unsure of what the future holds for its record - breaking former world champion , with the most recent update on his condition on the eve of june 's @entity15 travelling round the @entity3 community like @entity18 whispers			1
" @entity4 has left the [ hospital in ] @entity24 to continue his long phase of rehabilitation , " read the june 16 statement from @entity4 's long - time manager and the family 's spokeswoman @entity21			1
" he is not in a coma anymore , " added the statement , which was oblique enough to be left open to interpretation			1
as the months have stretched on since the accident , so has the reluctance to openly discuss the state of @entity4 's health within the sport 's inner circle			1
@entity37 , who drove alongside @entity4 at @entity38 , has been to visit his former teammate in hospital on more than one occasion			2
he found the news , as limited as it was , encouraging : " it 's definitely positive that he 's moved from the hospital and that he 's going to another place that is specific for the recovery , " the @entity43 driver told @entity0 ahead of this weekend 's @entity51 @entity15 " i keep hoping that everything will be better and better all the time			1
the only thing i want is that the recovery takes as quick as possible and to see him here with us			0
" @entity58 's four - time world champion @entity57 has been cautious about making public statements on the health of his former mentor			1
in @entity63 , the @entity62 broke his silence to reflect on the conflicting feelings of continuing his day job in @entity3 while the sport 's seven - time world champion faces an even bigger challenge than the high - risk world of motor racing			1
" it 's been a long time and you try to follow as much as you can , " @entity57 told the media with an audible sigh as he searched to find the right words			1
" it 's very positive to hear but , like i said , it 's been many , many weeks and months since the incident and obviously you find yourself busy in @entity3 thinking about a lot of things			2
" sometimes it 's crazy to imagine or realize that @entity4 is still in hospital and still fighting , " therefore it 's good to finally have some good news and i hope that there will be more good news coming -- but i think it will still take a long time for his recovery			1
" in a sport of strategy , where risk and outcome are calculated in hundredths of seconds , the uncertainty and lack of knowledge about @entity4 , a global star , has hung like a pall over the sport			2
interest in @entity4 's state of health is so intense that stolen medical files that may belong to the @entity62 have been offered for sale			1
" even people in the paddock who should be quite close have the feeling that we do n't know what 's going on , " @entity4 's biographer and respected @entity3 journalist @entity110 told @entity0			1
" the policy of the family is to keep everything very , very private			0
perhaps @entity119 [ @entity4 's wife ] maybe does n't realize is that by this policy speculation is growing			1
" there is a lot of public interest , they are concerned			0
a bit more information about what his current state of health is would be welcomed			0
" the difficulty with complex head injuries is that there is no predictable prognosis or timeline for recovery			2
in the immediate aftermath of the accident at the @entity141 resort of @entity142 , neurosurgeons operated on @entity4 twice to remove blood clots and reduce swelling on his brain before placing him in a medically induced coma			2
in april , a statement from the family said the 45 - year - old had shown " moments of consciousness and awakening			2
" last month , it was announced he was out of the coma and would continue his recovery at the @entity155 in @entity156 close to the family home in @entity158			2
" what tortures the public is the same thing that tortures the family -- progress is slow , progress is uncertain , " said @entity159 , a consultant neurological and spinal surgeon and expert in the field of head injuries in sport			2
" if you look at severe head injury victims who go on to make a good recovery -- and i 'm not saying all do -- it will always be a story of years			1
" the first months are dominated by questions of survival			0
gradually as the weeks and months go by those questions of survival turn into questions of the quality of survival			0
" it 's a rollercoaster and if @entity4 's rollercoaster takes him and his family somewhere happy then they will have been to places that will have been pretty unhappy on the way there			1
" but i know they will have been buoyed by all the support that has been voiced			0
" @entity159 speaks from a very public , personal experience following his successful high - profile treatment of brain - damaged boxer @entity194			1
the @entity51 boxer collapsed in the ring after being knocked down by fellow @entity198 @entity197 in a world title fight in 1991			0
@entity159 , who operated to remove a blood clot on @entity194 's brain shortly after his collapse and then guided his slow and painful recovery , is credited with saving @entity194 's life			1
although the news on @entity4 's condition is scant , @entity159 says the wording of the june statement is reason to be positive			1
" if i was using that language i would be suggesting that there had been some improvement and if you see improvement you may see more , " he explained			0
" i would take that as a hopeful sign			0
" my reading of what i 've seen in the press is that @entity4 has made it through the current cut and he 's still in the game			2
" @entity194 could not speak or hear for eight months after his accident			0
after six years in a wheelchair , he completed the 2003 @entity225 in an agonizing but rewarding six days			0
now , more than 20 years on from his brutal boxing bout , @entity194 's mind is sharp , his speech slurred but understandable and he can walk unaided , albeit with some difficulty			0
@entity159 believes the boxer 's training as a world - class sportsman aided his long physical and mental recovery -- and the same principles can also be applied to @entity4			1
" the thing about supreme athletes like @entity194 and @entity4 is that they have extraordinary physical reserves , " @entity159 said			1
" injuries that would carry away most people are things they can get past			0
" @entity194 underwent numerous operations at @entity159 's hand but the surgeon credits the boxer 's tenacity and indomitable spirit with his recovery as much as medical intervention			1
" it played a huge part , " @entity159 reflected			0
" he 's an absolutely humbling man when you get to know him			0
things that would crush most of us , he does with extraordinary cheerfulness			0
" i think that does come from the sort of tenacity , reserve and determination that you have to have if you 're to get to the top of any world sport			0
" @entity265 also have this ingrained attitude towards training that you have to repeat a thing a thousand times and then another thousand times until you get the thing right			0
" providing the right environment for recovery is actually very difficult and specialized			0
you have to continually stimulate and draw people on			0
" you have to keep changing the challenge , just moving it a little bit further forward so they relearn and regain their abilities as best they can			0
" when you talk to individuals who 've survived , they never gave up			0
the families never gave up			0
that 's a tough thing to do year on year			0
" @entity285 has recently commented to the @entity62 media that he witnessed @entity4 's famous mental resolve throughout three years as his @entity289 teammate and hopes this will guide the former champion through the next stage of his rehabilitation			1
" @entity285 said he knows what a fighter @entity4 can be , " explained @entity110 , who reports on @entity3 for @entity294 and @entity295 in @entity62			1
" he knew that @entity4 never let anything slip , even at the end of his career when he knew he was going to retire he was still fighting and pushing			2
" if there is somebody who can really fight back and get into life , it is probably @entity4			0
" for the watching world , it is difficult to know how far @entity4 has come on his journey since the accident and how far there is to go			2
there may just be a moment of inspiration , of interaction , which provides hope when it is least expected -- because that is what happened as @entity159 watched what he describes as @entity194 's " miraculous " recovery			2
" one day , some months into this business , @entity319 came to see him at the hospital , " recalled @entity159			2
" @entity319 , who was pretty ill already by then with @entity322 , went up to the end of @entity4 's bed , said words to the effect of ' hello champ ' and held out his fist			1
" @entity4 's eyes not only opened but focused on him , and this enormous smile appeared across his face as he realized who it was who had come to see him -- and it was at that point that i knew that things went in , got processed and could come out			1
" it was at that point that you know that people have the capacity to relearn , and to recover			0
" now , in the world of motor racing i 've no idea who @entity319 is -- unless it 's @entity4			2
" the world waits to see whether @entity4 , the ruthless racer , the sport 's record - breaking world champion , can once again be his own inspiration .			1
