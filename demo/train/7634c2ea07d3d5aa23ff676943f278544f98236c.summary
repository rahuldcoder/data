@entity0 has needled out @entity1 for the title of @entity4 's tallest building			1
@entity5 in @entity0 will be the @entity4 ' tallest building when completed , beating out @entity1 's @entity6 , according to an announcement tuesday by the @entity8			1
the main issue was whether a 408 - foot needle atop the @entity5 would be counted in the total height of the tower			2
the council 's height committee met on november 8 in @entity1 to rule on the height of the new skyscraper			2
on tuesday , the council announced that the needle , which was completed in may , was in fact a " spire " -- a " vertical element that completes the architectural expression of the building and is intended as permanent			2
" @entity5 's height to its architectural top is 1,776 feet ( 541.3 meters ) , according to the ruling			1
the @entity6 's architectural height is 1,451 feet ( 442.1 meters )			1
confused ? it 's a bit technical			0
25 great skyscrapers : icons of construction the council , an independent organization that certifies the official height of skyscrapers and acknowledges record - setting buildings , counts spires and structural elements in its height calculations			0
but it does n't count antennas , signage or flagpoles , which are considered " functional - technical equipment subject to change			0
" " it 's about the authorship of the architect in some ways , and the permanence of the piece to reinforce the role of design , " said council spokesman @entity46			0
as the building was originally designed , the needle atop the tower was to be enclosed in a radome , an architectural structure made of fiberglass and steel			0
but the proposed radome -- short for radar dome -- would not be able to be serviced or maintained , so the cladding plan was nixed			0
coming soon : @entity67 's first ' invisible ' tower project chief architect @entity68 and the rest of the @entity5 team convinced the council 's height committee that the spire was , itself , architectural			2
the designers noted that the top of the new building 's steel parapet is located at 1,368 feet , the height of the original @entity79 1			2
the spire reaches from that parapet to the new building 's height of 1,776 feet			1
" i feel completely satisfied that this building achieved what it set out to do , " @entity68 said			0
" we used the council 's rules and designed around them			0
it 's an important statement for all of us to make			0
" " with respect to the events of 9/11 and what this building commemorates with 1776 and democracy and freedom ... we were very happy to find that the building fit our criteria to be 1,776 feet tall , " said @entity89 , the council 's chairman			1
because @entity5 is n't yet finished and has n't received its certificate of occupancy , it can not be ranked as a " completed building , " but " its height is no longer in dispute , " the council said in a tuesday press release			1
upon completion , which is expected in early 2014 , the @entity0 skyscraper is expected to rank as the world 's third - tallest building , after the @entity109 in @entity110 and the @entity111 in @entity112 , @entity113 .			1

@entity5 ruled to be taller than @entity6
council on @entity117 says @entity5 measures 1,776 feet
when @entity5 is completed , it 's expected to be world 's third - tallest building
