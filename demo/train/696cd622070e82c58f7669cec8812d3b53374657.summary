whenever @entity1 â€” or his @entity2 -- discuss the evil ways of his haters these days , it sounds believable			2
to hear the @entity2 for the man they call " @entity10 " tell it , @entity1 's bosses on the @entity7 are out to get him , and the same goes for the entire establishment of @entity12			1
i mean , @entity10 would swear on a stack of trading cards that the world is forcing this guy to struggle up a hill with a cross made of old @entity20			1
i 'm not buying any of this , by the way , and neither should you			0
it does n't matter that the tongues for those on @entity28 are as smooth as @entity1 's hitting once was while he was evolving into the most prolific slugger of his time , before a five - year slide to ordinary or less			1
denial , denial , denial			1
not about @entity1 's likely use of performance - enhancing drugs within the last few years ( he has admitted that he used them when he played for the @entity39 from 2001 - 2003 )			1
@entity10 has moved around that subject on its tippy toes			1
they mostly issue denials that @entity1 is n't into misleading baseball officials , the @entity7 , his teammates , fans and even his absolutely pristine self about anything at any time			1
just thinking ... have n't we seen this middle part of a three - station cycle before from @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 ? yes , we have , and these figures are among those in the ever - expanding @entity62			1
for induction , you must ace the ability to move quickly from @entity66 to @entity67 , and before you reach @entity68 , you must challenge the world record of politicians for denying and denying some more			0
" i did not bet on baseball			0
" " i have never , ever used performance - enhancing drugs			0
" everybody wants to know what i am on			0
what am i on ? i 'm on my bike busting my ( butt ) six hours a day			0
what are you on ? " " let me start by telling you this : i have never used steroids , period			0
i do n't know how to say it any more clearly than that			1
" " this is all b.s. i am completely innocent			0
" " i take these charges very seriously and look forward to clearing my good name			0
" if you 're keeping score , the authors of those previous whoppers were @entity92 , @entity56 , @entity54 , @entity55 ( as he wagged his finger at a @entity95 congressman on @entity96 ) , @entity53 and @entity59			1
what 's up with this ? " athletes get hooked on notoriety and fame			2
i mean , when is the last time they had to buy a meal or a drink ? " said @entity102 , who spent years as a sports psychologist for the @entity104 before returning to private practice			1
he also serves as a professor at @entity111 in @entity112			0
added @entity102 , " they think everybody loves them , because there are so many people looking at them as their heroes			0
" so , athletes start to think that , because of their great deeds and because of the championships they may have won , the public in the end is going to forgive them for whatever they decide to do			0
" opinion : how @entity10 let us down that 's why , after the @entity129 and @entity67 , members of the @entity62 do n't bother with the confession until evidence surfaces to confirm their guilt beyond a shadow of a doubt			1
then they throw themselves to the mercy of their fans , but only after they have slashed and burned a bunch of innocent folks along the way			0
as a result , this @entity1 thing is about to get creepier , because it feels so much like everything i just wrote			0
there is @entity12 claiming @entity1 joined 12 other players in purchasing and using performance - enhancing drugs from a clinic in south @entity151 called @entity152			0
according to reports , those same baseball officials say @entity1 tried to hinder their investigation by lying and by encouraging others to do the same			2
there also are reports from @entity159 's 60 minutes that @entity1 used some of his associates to squeal on other drug - using players in an attempt to cover his pinstripes			2
which brings us to this : follow the money			0
the @entity171 reported this week that @entity1 has retained at least six law firms and two public relations firms			0
among other things , the paper said those @entity10 entities are trying to prove the @entity7 and @entity12 are trying to take away as much of what remains of @entity1 's original $ 275 million contract as possible			1
baseball officials had slapped @entity1 with a 211 - game suspension that would keep the 38 - year - old third baseman out of the game until after the start of the 2015 season			2
he appealed the decision , and it will be months before the results are known			0
if the suspension is upheld , @entity1 will lose approximately $ 34 million of his salary			2
until then , when it 's raining , we 'll have @entity1 telling us the sunshine is beating against his shades			1
" it 's the same thing as somebody suffering from alcoholism			2
denial , " @entity102 said			2
" now , in the case of some of the people we 're talking about , they just look at everything ( @entity203 use , conniving , lying ) as simply , ' this is what i have to do to compete at the highest level , ' and in their mind -- morally and ethically -- it 's not wrong			1
it 's also like , ' if i do get caught , what 's going to happen to me ? ' i mean , we 're eventually going to put @entity57 in the @entity213 , and that sort of thing allows athletes to go into this denial thing along the way to being so convincing			1
opinion : is doping at work and in class ok ? " to them , it 's really like that old kid 's line you hear : if you start telling a lie long enough , you start to believe it			1
" yeah , but the rest of us do n't have to believe it .			2

@entity234 : as he faces suspension , @entity10 plays *martyr* *besieged* by forces out to get him
he says do n't buy it . it 's denial common to fallen sports stars , from @entity57 to @entity54
he says in @entity62 , first come accusations , then denial , and confession . why ?
@entity234 : lying sports stars ca n't accept fall ; think if they repeat lie enough , it 'll be true . do n't buy it
