-- on april 8 , 1988 , when he was 16 and long before he became a model , rapper and actor , @entity5 -- high on drugs and alcohol -- assaulted a man while trying to steal two cases of alcohol and then punched another man in the face as he attempted to avoid the police			1
he was arrested , sentenced and tried as an adult , and he served 45 days in prison			1
today , at 43 , @entity5 is a much different person -- a father of four , a successful movie star , a philanthropist who works with at - risk youth -- but says he 's still legally affected by his convictions			1
in a petition submitted monday ( @entity21 ) , he 's asking for a pardon			1
" i am deeply sorry for the actions that i took on the night of april 8 , 1988 , as well as for any lasting damage i may have caused the victims , " he writes in the petition			0
" since that time , i have dedicated myself to becoming a better person and citizen so that i can be a role model to my children and others			1
" @entity5 says his record " can potentially be the bases to deny me a concessionaire 's license in @entity34 and elsewhere , " something important to him because of his interest in @entity40 , a restaurant he hopes to expand			1
moreover , he says , " given my prior record , @entity44 and @entity34 law prohibit me from actually obtaining positions in law enforcement , " which he says prevents him from becoming " more active in law enforcement activities			0
" @entity5 has frequently acknowledged his troubled past			2
in july , he told @entity51 that he draws on his experiences in his acting			0
" i have a lot of real life experience that i can draw on , " @entity5 said			2
" and i think that shows in the characters that i play because i 'm always trying to find somebody -- or find characters to play that i can identify with on a personal level or relate to			0
and i think it makes for a little bit more of an honest portrayal			0
" he added , " once i got a second chance , i was never going to do anything to mess it up			0
" in the petition , @entity5 notes that in 2001 he started the @entity5 , which has donated $ 7 million to various youth causes , and he 's very active in the @entity70			1
news reports have noted that @entity5 left some details out of his pardon			1
as his sentencing memorandum states , he made a racial slur to the first man he hit and continued with such speech after he was arrested			0
one victim was left blind in one eye , according to an @entity81 report			0
@entity5 admits that his reasons for asking for a pardon go beyond just having certain legal rights smoothed out			1
" the more complex answer is that receiving a pardon would be a formal recognition that i am not the same person that i was the night of april 8 , 1988 , " he writes			2
" it would be formal recognition that someone like me can receive official public redemption if he devotes himself to personal improvement and a life of good works			0
" the pardon would also be a message for troubled youths that " they too can turn their lives around and be formally accepted back into society , " he adds			2
some observers have been skeptical of the request			0
" even if @entity5 is not the same person anymore , he was that person at one point , and if he 's seeking a pardon the full version of how he acted is what should be judged , " wrote the @entity108 's @entity107			1
commenters on @entity112 's @entity113 's " @entity111 " were harsher			2
" why him and not numerous others who have turned their lives around ? has he made amends to the victim ? " wrote jockstevens			0
" ah , no. it would n't be fair to others in the same situation , " wrote the flip side			0
@entity5 's case will be reviewed by the parole board , which will pass its recommendation to gov. @entity124 , who will make the final decision pending approval by the eight - person @entity127			1
@entity0 's @entity129 contributed to this report .			2
