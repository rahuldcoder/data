the head of @entity1 had warned @entity2 against betraying their promise to maintain secrecy just days ahead of a seal 's " @entity5 " interview defending his publication of details from the @entity11 mission			1
the open letter specifies that the warning holds even after a mission is over , and it scolds those seeking public credit			1
the admonition is seemingly directed both at @entity18 -- who revealed his role on the 2011 @entity11 mission with " @entity5 " on sunday -- and at a seal at the center of an upcoming @entity24 documentary			1
it was @entity27 's second interview with the @entity29 show			0
the october 31 letter from adm. @entity31 obtained by @entity32 was addressed to " teammates " and sought to shame those who sought public acclaim , reminding @entity2 " the most important credit we can garner is the respect of our teammates and partners			1
" letter speaks of core values , private accolades " we do not abide willful or selfish disregard for our core values in return for public notoriety and financial gain , " @entity31 wrote			2
" any real credit to be rendered is about the incredible focus , commitment , and teamwork of this diverse network and the years of hard work undertaken with little individual public credit			0
it is the nature of our profession , " he also wrote			0
the missive was first reported by @entity60 , a website that covers the @entity63 community			0
the new story of the death of @entity11 the letter is not the first			2
@entity31 's predecessor also sent a letter reminding seals to keep the confidence of the mission			2
while @entity31 does not mention the @entity11 raid directly , it 's the publication of those details and the mission to free the captured sailors of the @entity78 in 2009 off the coast of @entity80 that have gotten much publicity			1
@entity60 has identified the so - called " shooter " of @entity11 , who was the unnamed subject of a @entity85 article last year and whose identity will reportedly be revealed in an upcoming @entity24 documentary			0
@entity32 has not confirmed the name of the seal is accurate			0
the claims in the @entity85 article were met with skepticism by those in the @entity2 community who said the close quarters and darkness and intense shooting made it difficult to determine whose bullets killed @entity11			1
@entity99 in 2013 : who really killed @entity11 ? criminal inquiry into @entity2 the @entity102 and @entity103 are conducting a criminal inquiry of @entity27 and his bestselling book about the raid in @entity107			1
that inquiry has delayed a legal settlement between the government and the author over profits from the book			0
@entity27 did n't seek the legally required government review before he published the book " @entity18 " in 2012			2
the book recounts what he says is his role as one of the @entity121 members who shot and killed @entity11			0
the man who hunted @entity11 , @entity123 and the pirates the @entity102 will not even confirm that @entity27 was even on the raid			1
@entity127 , a spokeswoman , would only say of @entity27 and his connection to the mission : " if in fact this individual was associated with the military unit that carried out the @entity11 raid ... is yet to be determined			1
" @entity27 notes that while he revealed details , so did the @entity135 and @entity102 when they cooperated with the filmmakers of " @entity137 , " a dramatic retelling of the hunt for the @entity141 leader			0

the letter came just days before a " @entity5 " appearance by @entity18
@entity27 said he was on the @entity107 raid in which @entity11 was killed
@entity31 reminds @entity2 they *'ve* made a *vow* to maintain mission secrecy and *eschew* glory
