@entity0 on friday gave the nation 's 40,000 - plus airport screeners the opportunity to engage in limited collective bargaining , pressing ahead on a hot - button issue that has separated @entity9 and @entity10 since the creation of the @entity3 after the 2001 terrorist attacks			1
when @entity14 created the @entity3 in 2003 , it gave the administrator the authority to decide whether or not screeners should be allowed to engage in collective bargaining			1
@entity19 administration @entity3 chiefs opted not to endorse bargaining , saying it would impede their ability to protect the public			1
on friday , @entity3 administrator @entity24 announced he would allow airport screeners to select a union for collective bargaining , or to forgo bargaining			1
in a statement , @entity24 said sitting down at a bargaining table with screeners would not jeopardize the nation			2
" the safety of the traveling public is our top priority and we will not negotiate on security , " @entity24 said			2
indeed , the paper outlining his decision precludes negotiations on security policies , pay , pensions and compensation , proficiency testing , job qualifications and discipline standards			0
it also will prohibit screeners from striking or engaging in work slowdowns			0
the announcement gives added weight to a recent @entity52 decision to allow a vote granting sole union representation authority to a single union			0
the @entity52 has tentatively scheduled a vote for march 9 through april 19 to determine which union will represent airport screeners			0
it will also give the screeners the option of having no union represent them			2
the unions vying for the job are the @entity65 , part of the @entity67 , and the @entity68			0
both unions called @entity24 's decision good news			0
congressional reaction fell along party lines			0
" i want to commend @entity77 for taking this positive step , " said rep. @entity74 , @entity75 , ranking member of the @entity76			0
" collective bargaining does not diminish our security -- it can actually enhance workforce productivity and @entity3 's mission			1
" rep. @entity84 , @entity85 , called the move " president @entity87 's biggest give to organized labor			0
" during the formation of the @entity3 , @entity14 limited airport screener 's unionization powers , saying managers needed flexibility to address changing terrorist threats			1
@entity19 administration officials later cited the 2006 liquid bomb plot , when the @entity3 rapidly changed restrictions to prevent terrorists from smuggling explosive liquids on passenger aircraft			2
@entity3 officials say they did not have to consult with union representatives before changing screening protocols and work hours			2
but supporters of collective bargaining powers say that numerous other law enforcement agencies have broad union rights that do not hinder security			1
as a presidential candidate , @entity87 promised to support collective bargaining for airport screeners			1
in a letter to a union chief just two weeks before the 2008 election , @entity87 wrote that if he was elected , " i will work to ensure that @entity116 [ @entity3 ] have collective bargaining rights			1
" he said he would make it a " priority for my administration			0

@entity3 will allow screeners option of collective bargaining rights
but screeners wo *n't* be able to negotiate on many issues
matter has been long *debated* in @entity14
