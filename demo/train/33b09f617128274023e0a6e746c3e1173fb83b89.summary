-- perhaps the oddest part of @entity3 's interview with @entity0 's @entity4 was the way he unloaded on @entity6			1
it was the second time in about a month that the owner of the @entity9 launched into tirade against the @entity12 point guard , entrepreneur and philanthropist			2
in the recorded conversation that earned @entity16 a lifetime ban from the @entity12 , he was caught telling friend @entity18 that he does n't want her posting pictures with african - americans , including @entity6			1
in monday night 's @entity0 interview with @entity4 , he went further -- much further			1
" what has he done ? can you tell me ? @entity28 , what has he done ? " he said , turning the question on the @entity0 host			1
" he 's got @entity31			0
did he do any business , did he help anybody in @entity34 ? " what kind of a guy goes to every city , has sex with every girl , then he catches @entity40 ? is that someone we want to respect and tell our kids about ? i think he should be ashamed of himself			2
i think he should go into the background			0
but what does he do for the black people ? he does n't do anything			0
" so , let 's ask the question : what has @entity6 ever done ? as it turns out , quite a bit -- and he 's been doing them for a long time			1
@entity3 insists he 's no racist , still slams @entity6 he won championships for more than three decades , @entity6 has had the " @entity6 " touch			1
he led @entity57 to a national title in 1979 before going first in the @entity12 draft and winning the championship with the @entity61 during his very first year in the league			0
the paycheck was nice too			0
@entity6 signed a 25 - year deal for $ 25 million			1
it was the longest and highest - paying gig in sports at the time			0
in 13 seasons with the @entity61 , he racked up five @entity12 championships and three mvp awards			0
and do n't forget the @entity70 in 1992 as a part of the " @entity72 " -- the first year pro players could take part			0
nine months earlier , @entity76 gold seemed like anything but a dream			0
he helped change attitudes about hiv / aids when @entity6 announced he was @entity40 positive and retiring from the @entity61 in november 1991 , it sounded more like a death sentence -- so little was known about the disease at the time			1
but he helped change @entity87 's attitude toward the disease			0
in an interview with @entity4 in november , he described himself as " the blessing and the curse of @entity40			2
" " i 'm the blessing because people were talking about it , they ran out and got tested at that time , " he said			0
" then i 'm the curse because ... people now say , oh well , @entity40 is nothing because if i get it i can be like @entity6			2
he 's doing good , and i can do the same thing he 's doing or take the same medicine he 's taking and i 'll be okay			0
" " but what they do n't understand , " he added , " in 22 years , millions of people have died			2
" and so , he says , his work is n't done			0
he 's raised millions for charity the same month he tested positive for @entity40 , he formed the @entity103 which " works to develop programs and support community - based organizations that address the educational , health and social needs of ethnically diverse , urban communities			1
" fact - checking the @entity16 interview in the two - plus decades since the world gasped at his @entity40 announcement , the foundation has raised more than $ 20 million for charity and given out almost $ 4 million in scholarships			1
he 's brought business to minority communities as it turns out , @entity6 was a pretty good businessman too			1
he founded @entity119 in 1987			0
the focus again was on serving diverse communities , bringing high - quality businesses to minority areas typically under served by larger corporations			0
and @entity6 seemed to invest in nearly everything -- theaters , restaurants , fitness centers , sports teams and a tv network			2
a partnership with @entity133 ceo @entity132 made him millions			2
so did a share of the @entity61 he bought and sold			0
all together , @entity6 's business empire is estimated at $ 500 million			1
he 's taken the high road with numbers like that , it 's no surprise that @entity141 's longtime agent and friend @entity140 came to his defense monday night , saying @entity6 was " the exact opposite " of the way @entity16 portrayed him in the @entity0 interview			1
" i 've known @entity6 since 1979 and his whole mission in life has been to create business opportunities in urban @entity87 and to be charitable , " @entity140 said in a @entity148 interview on monday			1
" he has literally donated tens of millions of dollars of his own money to organizations and individuals forever and ever and ever			2
" for his part , @entity6 did n't dignify @entity16 's contentions with a remark			2
@entity6 posted a series of tweets after the interview aired , but he did n't respond to the specific allegations			1
" i 'd rather be talking about these great @entity162 than @entity3 's interview , " he said in one			1
" after this week , no more @entity16 talk			0
just the @entity162 , " he said in another			0
@entity3 's claims vs. reality @entity0 's @entity167 contributed to this report			1
