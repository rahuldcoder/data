@entity0 -- it was just a few words and a joke at that			0
but @entity7 @entity6 broke his seven - year long silence on monday when he spoke at oral arguments			1
he made fun of lawyers from @entity12 , his law school alma mater			1
@entity6 has become known for rarely commenting on cases from the bench , another reflection of the complex and often misunderstood personality of the court 's only @entity22 - @entity21 jurist			1
on monday , the justices were hearing an argument about the state of @entity28 's delay in paying for counsel for a death penalty defendant			2
should that count against the state for the purposes of the right to a speedy trial ? a lawyer for the state was making the case for the inmate 's appointed counsel , saying the woman was " more than qualified " and " very impressive			0
" " she was graduate of @entity12 , was n't she ? " said justice @entity41 in apparent support , noting another member of the legal team went to @entity45			1
the next words were hard to hear in the back - and - forth between the justices			0
but @entity6 made a joke about the competence of @entity12 lawyers when compared to their @entity45 colleagues , according to two witnesses			1
six members of the current high court attended @entity45			2
@entity6 , @entity56 and @entity57 attended @entity12			1
@entity57 describes life journey in new memoir the official transcript released by the court does not capture the flavor of the colorful exchange			0
but the lawyer arguing before the court was apparently not pleased			0
" i would refute that , @entity6 , " said @entity65 , the assistant district attorney in @entity66 , @entity28			1
the rest of the time , @entity6 kept his own counsel as he is known to do			1
" one thing i 've demonstrated often in 16 years is you can do this job without asking a single question , " he recalled in a speech five years ago			0
written opinions remain the main way the court expresses itself			0
but the current court is known as a " hot bench " for the busy back - and - forth rhetorical scrum during arguments			1
eight of the justices compete for time to make their questions and views known			0
@entity6 does occasionally speak from the bench when announcing opinions he has written , but before arguments commence			1
off the bench in friendly audiences , he can be gregarious , inquisitive and often self - reflective			2
he has a booming voice , and his hearty laugh is easily recognizable			0
some scholars have said @entity6 ' aversion to talking has reached epic heights			2
a study of transcripts by @entity99 of the @entity100 found in the past four decades , no justice besides @entity6 had failed to speak at least once during an entire 12 - month term			2
