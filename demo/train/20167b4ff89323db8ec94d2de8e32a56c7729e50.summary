@entity0 -- there is one thing to be said about attorney general @entity4			1
he has a way with words that makes conservatives furious -- especially when he starts talking about race and the law			2
early in the @entity14 administration , @entity4 said that we are " a nation of cowards " when it comes to issues of race			1
the conservative chattering class erupted			0
@entity4 is at it again			0
he has fired up the right with his comments about the @entity26 case , blaming " mistaken beliefs and stereotypes " for the shooting of the @entity29 teenager			0
and now he is going after @entity33 ' voting laws			2
at the annual conference of the @entity35 in @entity0 on thursday , @entity4 renewed his attack on a recent @entity38 ruling that gutted the @entity39			2
" despite the court 's decision , i believe we must regard this setback not as a defeat but as a historic opportunity for @entity46 to restore , and even to strengthen , modern voting protections , " @entity4 said			1
feds want @entity33 to clear voting - rights changes with them he then announced the @entity57 will " ask a federal court in @entity33 to subject the state of @entity33 ... to obtain ' pre-approval ' from either the department or a federal court before implementing future voting changes , " similar to a provision in the @entity39			1
his remarks are the @entity57 's first significant response to last month 's court ruling and seeks to address @entity33 ' controversial redistricting law that @entity4 filed suit against in 2012			1
@entity4 said the state had a " history of pervasive voting - related discrimination against racial minorities that the @entity38 itself has recognized			2
" the attorney general previously has been accused by the conservative press of " abuse of power " and of " exploiting tragedies " by the @entity74			1
former @entity76 rep. @entity75 attacked @entity4 for what he called " race - baiting " and " exploiting the law			1
" civil rights organizations have called on @entity4 and the @entity57 to pursue federal charges against @entity82 after he was found not guilty in the @entity26 shooting			1
@entity85 professor @entity84 , who mentions @entity4 several times in his book about racial profiling , " the presumption of guilt , " said the attorney general " has no fear or reticence to talk about race wherever he thinks it needs to be discussed and that leads to a host of reactions , usually negative , from people			1
" " i think he is being very straightforward , and some people take it as being provocative			0
he is very honest about his views about race and justice , " @entity84 said			0
provocative , or not , @entity4 has attracted little public criticism for his language from the one person who matters most -- his boss , president @entity14			1
the relative silence has created speculation that @entity4 is saying things the country 's first @entity115 - @entity76 president might like to say but can not			0
@entity117 , an @entity119 justice , law and society professor , said it 's almost certain the @entity123 approved @entity4 's recent remarks on race though @entity14 still had some deniability about them			1
" attorney general @entity4 is speaking for the president , but there 's enough distance for @entity14 to say it 's not the view of the president			1
" @entity84 , who taught @entity14 in law school , said he is n't so sure			0
" he certainly is n't speaking for president @entity14 ; sometimes he is speaking before the president has a chance , " @entity84 said			0
still , @entity4 is " saying some candid things about race that you do n't expect the president to be able to say without being divisive			0
and i think @entity4 's view is that i 'm an experienced lawyer , i 'm a former judge , i 'm a former prosecutor			0
... i know all these areas , and i 'm just going to be candid			0
he is older than president @entity14 , he 's been around , " @entity84 added			0
just the same , @entity145 , former director of public affairs for the @entity57 , said @entity4 is " a proxy for attacking the president			2
" " in other words when mr. @entity14 's political enemies go after @entity4 , they are taking a swipe at the @entity123 as well , which makes @entity4 pretty useful to the administration			2
he 's out there taking the heat on guns , voting rights and some other issues			0
" and in many ways , that is what the job of attorney general has become , said the former public affairs director			2
anyone who holds the office is expected to take tremendous political heat			0
" the @entity57 and the attorney general deal with so many controversial issues that split the parties in half , and @entity4 , as the head of @entity57 , has not shied away from fights that he believes in , that drives @entity174 crazy , " @entity145 said .			1
