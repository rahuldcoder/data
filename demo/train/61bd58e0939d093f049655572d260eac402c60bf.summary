-- for much of the last century , people in the small town of @entity3 , @entity4 , were surrounded by toxic asbestos			1
it covered patches of grass , dusted the tops of cars and drifted through the air in a hazy smoke that became a part of their daily lives			1

now , after decades of suffering and watching loved ones die , area residents are getting their day in court			2
federal prosecutors have begun a trial of the mining company they blame for the pollution , which doctors say left more than 1,000 people ill and more than 200 dead			1
" there 's never been a case where so many people were sickened or killed by environmental crime , " says @entity29 , who helped spearhead the case when he was the @entity31 's top prosecutor of environmental crimes before stepping down in 2007			1
" it 's the most significant environmental criminal prosecution that 's ever been brought			1
" @entity38 , a 71 - year - old @entity3 resident , told @entity0 on monday that the legal efforts " should have been over a long time ago			2
" @entity38 says he has suffered from lung cancer linked to asbestos exposure			1
those who lost loved ones were among the first witnesses at the trial			2
arguments began last week at the federal courthouse in @entity48 , @entity4			1
they said the town was kept in the dark about the dangers			1
one woman said that as kids , she and friends would light up the toxic dust and even " put it in our mouths , " @entity0 affiliate @entity53 of @entity48 reported			2
until 1990 , @entity59 operated a mine in @entity3 that produced vermiculite , a substance used in all sorts of products , from insulation to fertilizers			2
the vermiculite was contaminated with tremolite asbestos -- a particularly toxic form linked to numerous illnesses including mesothelioma , a cancer that can attack the lining of the lungs , abdomen , or heart			1
the government 's indictment alleges that @entity17 conspired to " knowingly release " the asbestos			1
it says the company tried to hide the dangers from employees and residents , leaving them " in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury			1
" " it was a purpose of the conspiracy to conceal and misrepresent the hazardous nature of the tremolite asbestos contaminated vermiculite , thereby enriching defendants and others , " the indictment reads			1
and the indictment says @entity17 tried to " defraud the @entity97 and others by impairing , impeding , and frustrating " the @entity99 and other government agencies once they launched an investigation in 1999			1
the 10 - count indictment also includes charges of wire fraud and obstruction of justice			2
if convicted , the company could face criminal fines of up to $ 280 million -- twice the value of its profits from the mine			1
five executives who are named as defendants could face prison time			2
prosecutors plan to try a sixth executive separately			1
company denies conspiracy the company does not deny that asbestos emanated from its plant			1
nor does it question whether some people were sickened and killed , though a definitive number of deaths linked to the vermiculite plant probably will never be known			1
but @entity17 denies any kind of conspiracy			1
in fact , the company says , it acted responsibly and took appropriate steps			2
@entity132 in @entity3 , @entity4			0
some residents say the town was kept in the dark about asbestos dangers			1
in a statement when the indictment was issued in 2005 , @entity17 said it " categorically denies any criminal wrongdoing			1
" that statement came before the company launched a series of legal challenges that went as far as the @entity97 @entity145			2
in response to questions from @entity0 , @entity17 said at the time that it was acting as a good corporate citizen and had voluntarily paid millions of dollars in medical bills for 900 @entity3 residents			1
both sides are now respecting the request of @entity97 district judge @entity154 that they not speak to the media			0
in the courtroom , defense attorneys have noted that the asbestos problem dates back to about 1920 -- long before @entity17 took over the mine in 1963			1
attorneys say that as information about the asbestos came to light , the company took numerous steps to mitigate the dangers and were open about it			1
@entity17 followed a " plan " that was in no way " hush hush , " and was subject to government inspection , defense attorney @entity168 told the jury , according to @entity53			1
the defense also says the government had " vast information " about asbestos in @entity3 before the @entity99 came along in 1999 to launch an investigation			1
deputy @entity97 attorney @entity179 told the jury that the the trial is about " holding this company and these officials accountable for a very serious wrong , " @entity53 reported			2
the government says internal memos from the company will help make the prosecution 's case			1
in testimony that began last week , residents described the clouds of smoke that would emanate from the mine and drop dust across the town			0
" @entity198 was all over the ground " at the mine 's export plant , said @entity195 , a minister from the nearby town of @entity197			0
he said he " did n't see any hazard " and would walk through the piles " without his shoes " on , @entity53 reported			0
he also said the vermiculite was mixed with wood chips and covered the ground under the bleachers and dugouts at baseball fields			2
residents cope with illness @entity0 visited @entity3 in 2000 and met @entity214 and @entity215 , who described their devastation when @entity214 became seriously ill at age 38 , after he had stopped working at the mine			0
both his lungs filled with fluid , and he was diagnosed with asbestosis , a lung disease caused by asbestos particles had he known of the dangers , " i would n't have raised my children here			1
i would n't have took them up on the hill to breathe the same stuff i was breathing , " he said			0
health problems can occur years after exposure to asbestos			2
the @entity233 filed a suit against the company			2
it was among dozens that were settled			0
" my dad , he is still alive , " the @entity233 ' daughter , @entity238 , told @entity0 on monday			0
" his lungs have gotten worse , but he 's not on oxygen yet			0
we just pray to the @entity244 and take one day at a time			0
" @entity245 and @entity246 and four of their five children were diagnosed with asbestosis			0
" we just grew up with it			0
it was always there , " @entity246 said			0
" the kids always liked to go with @entity253 in his rigs because you could play tic - tac - toe			0
" she added , " they called it a nuisance dust , the company did			2
" but @entity261 , who was a project manager at the mine , told @entity0 in 2000 , " from the time @entity17 understood that there was a problem , there was a continuous movement of minimizing the risk to the employees			1
" @entity261 was named as a defendant in the case , but he died in 2007			0
speaking to @entity0 on monday , @entity246 said that she is now on oxygen			0
her oldest child , @entity272 , is in his mid- 50s and goes " off and on oxygen , " she said			0
@entity272 had also worked at the mine			0
the other children are doing well overall , though she said that their fifth child , a daughter , also was diagnosed with asbestosis			0
" i feel kind of sorry for those people			0
they have to live with themselves			0
i know there 's a much higher judge , and they will be facing him sometime , " she said			0
squaring off in court reporters in the courtroom have noted a striking frequency of objections by the defense			0
many involve the critical issue of timing			0
judge @entity154 has ruled in the defense 's favor that the government must prove a conspiracy took place after the @entity300 took effect in 1990			2
and due to the statute of limitations , the government needs to demonstrate that criminal conduct occurred in 1999 or later , former prosecutor @entity29 told @entity0			1
he called timing " one of the big challenges the government has in the case			2
" the trial has seen some courtroom drama			0
in one tense exchange , the @entity99 's cleanup coordinator for @entity3 , @entity314 , accused defense attorney @entity168 of spouting " nonsense			0
" @entity314 also testified that his dog ate a piece of evidence -- a notebook that might have contained relevant information , @entity53 reported			0
the trial is expected to last for months			0
yet residents of @entity3 have gotten used to waiting			0
generations after the town began suffering , 10 years after the @entity99 launched its investigation , and four years after the indictment was issued , stricken families are watching to see who may ultimately be held accountable .			0
