@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 lawmakers have given president @entity4 special decree powers to fight an " economic war , " but the shape that fight will take is uncertain			1
@entity4 has promised to use his new powers -- approved by the @entity10 on tuesday -- to make sweeping changes to the way the economy is run in the oil - rich , but poorly managed @entity16 nation			1
among his priorities , @entity4 says , will be to cap profits for businesses at between 15 % and 30 % and to enforce price controls on an expanding number of goods			1
some see this as a movement to a fully socialist model ; other see political opportunism			1
in recent months , @entity4 has blamed capitalism for speculation that is driving high rates of inflation and creating widespread shortages of staples			1
the so - called " enabling law " that grants him decree powers could make it easier for him to set price controls , as he did recently to an electronics and appliance chain he accused of price gouging			2
the result was a run on the @entity45 chain of stores , as people mobbed to buy deeply discounted electronics in chaotic scenes that included some looting			2
" consumerism is not the path , " the president said tuesday			2
" we are re-establishing prices so that the people 's economic rights are respected , not to consume without control			1
" the underlying goal of these expanded powers are for @entity4 to push a socialist agenda to the point of no return , said @entity63 , a @entity1 constitutional lawyer			1
" what we 've seen is just a little of what 's coming , " he told @entity2 en @entity64			2
" @entity68 's primary objective is now is to regulate the profits of all companies that provide services or produce goods			2
" those who agree with @entity63 fear that foreign investment in @entity1 will dry up as the government cuts their profits			0
but behind the blustery rhetoric , there may be hints at a more pragmatic approach , said @entity81 , a @entity1 expert and senior fellow at the @entity83			0
faced with a difficult transition after the death of president @entity86 , @entity4 has adopted the economic war for political purposes , @entity81 said			1
the bloc that supported @entity86 has been difficult for @entity4 to keep together			1
by putting a name and a face to the " enemy , " as he did by singling out the @entity45 electronics chain , the president is trying to unite voters behind his party ahead of local elections next month , @entity81 said			0
" their idea is to have this carry them through the elections , " he said			0
" i think it 's completely political			1
" behind the scenes , there are signs that the @entity1 government is taking a less controversial approach to its economy			0
to fight a shortage of dollars , @entity1 's state - run oil company announced it will sell $ 4.5 billion in bonds , for instance			0
there are also reports that it will try to make up even more ground by selling gold from its reserves			0
facing shortages , @entity1 takes over toilet paper factory @entity4 has n't highlighted these moves the same way he has trumpeted his new decree powers , but they are telling of a more pragmatic approach , @entity81 said			1
the government 's short - term goal , @entity1 analyst @entity125 agreed , could be to gain an advantage at the polls			0
once the election is over , the government will have to take unpopular steps , such as devaluing its currency , to curb inflation			0
" i think it 's inevitable that to face the current economic situation the government will have to take some measures that will have a negative impact on the lower classes , " @entity125 said			2
on the streets , some @entity1 see the economic war that their leader is waging as a necessity , or as a dangerous blank check			1
" there 's no merchandise , and what 's available is expensive , " said @entity145 , who sells fish			0
he has seen variety falling and costs rising , and would like to see a " fair price , " for more products , he said			0
@entity154 expels three @entity1 diplomats journalist @entity156 reported from @entity0			0
@entity157 reported and wrote the story in @entity159 .			0
