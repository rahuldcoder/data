-- as the economy continues to look grim , the word " bankruptcy " is on the tips of more and more tongues			1
while being unable to pay one 's creditors is never a good situation for a company or an individual , it may not be the financial kiss of death that you might think			1
( just ask @entity14 , whose casinos have gone bankrupt twice			2
) @entity16 was just one of several @entity18 presidents who declared bankruptcy during their lifetimes			2
a number of successful people have found themselves overextended and ended up filing for bankruptcy , only to successfully stick it out and find firmer financial footing again			2
here are a few famous names who knew what it 's like to be strapped for cash : 1			1
@entity16 his face may now appear on the penny , but at one time , @entity16 did n't have a single cent to spare			0
@entity16 tried many occupations as a young man , including buying a general store in @entity36 , @entity37 , in 1832			0
while he may have been terrific at splitting rails , winning debates , and wearing stovepipe hats , @entity16 was n't much of a shopkeeper			0
@entity16 and his partner started buying out other stores ' inventories on credit , but their own sales were dismal			0
@entity0 : how ex-presidents make ends meet as the store 's debts mounted , @entity16 sold his share , but when his partner died , the future president became liable for $ 1,000 in back payments			1
@entity16 did n't have modern bankruptcy laws to protect him , so when his creditors took him to court , he lost his two remaining assets : a horse and some surveying gear			2
that was n't enough to foot his bill , though , and @entity16 continued paying off his debts until well into the 1840s			2
@entity16 's not alone in the annals of bankrupt commanders - in - chief , though			1
@entity67 went bankrupt after leaving office when a partner in an investment - banking venture swindled him			2
@entity71 filed for bankruptcy several times , including after leaving office , possibly because he threw around a lot of cash on food and wine			1
@entity79 went bankrupt while serving as @entity81 's governor in 1893 ; he was $ 130,000 in the red before eventually straightening out with the help of friends			1
he won the @entity85 just three years later			0

@entity90 speculation abounds about the future of the @entity94 motor companies , leading some observers to wonder what @entity90 would think of this financial peril			0
@entity98 actually could n't be too judgmental , though , because he was no stranger to debt himself			0
in 1899 the young mechanic and engineer started the @entity104 with the backing of three prominent politicians			0
@entity98 had n't quite mastered the innovation and production techniques that would eventually make him rich , though			0
over the next two years , @entity98 proved to be too much of a perfectionist , and his plant only produced 20 cars as he painstakingly tinkered with designs			0
the enterprise went bankrupt in 1901 and reorganized into the @entity116 later that year			1
@entity90 eventually left that group and finally got things right in 1903 , when he founded the @entity98			0
things did n't go so badly for the @entity116 after he left , either ; it changed its name into one you might find a bit more recognizable : the @entity123			0
@entity98 was n't the only auto magnate who knew how bankruptcy felt , though			2
@entity128 founder @entity127 took a massive hit during the @entity130 that saw his fortune fall from $ 120 million to bankruptcy			2
he spent his last few years running a bowling alley in @entity133 , @entity134			2
@entity135 his name may be a stalwart brand today , but early in his career , @entity135 was just a struggling filmmaker with too many bills			0
in 1922 he started his first film company with a partner in @entity144 , @entity145			0
the two men bought a used camera and made short advertising films and cartoons under the studio name @entity151			0
@entity135 even signed a deal with a @entity154 company to distribute the films he was producing			0
that arrangement did n't work out so well , though , as the distributor cheated @entity135 's studio			2
without the distributor 's cash , @entity135 could n't cover his overhead , and his studio went bankrupt in 1923			1
he then left @entity144 for @entity165 , and after a series of increasingly successful creations , @entity135 debuted a new character named @entity169 in 1928			0
@entity0 : the secrets behind your favorite toys 4			0
@entity173 @entity173 always knew he could make candy , but running a successful business seemed just out of his reach			1
although he never had a formal education , @entity177 spent four years apprenticing in a candy shop before striking out on his own in @entity181 in 1876			1
six years later , his shop went under , as did a subsequent attempt to peddle sweets in @entity154			2
@entity177 then returned home to @entity186 , @entity187 , where he pioneered the use of fresh milk in caramel productions and founded the successful @entity192			0
in 1900 he sold the caramel company for $ 1 million so he could focus on perfecting a milk chocolate formula			0
once he finally nailed the recipe down , he was too rich ( and too flush with delicious chocolate ) for anyone to remember the flops of his early candy ventures			2
@entity200 @entity200 was one of @entity165 's biggest stars of the 1970s			1
unfortunately , though , he spent money like his career would never hit a downswing			2
he owned mansions on both coasts , a helicopter , and a lavish @entity209 ranch			0
gradually , his financial situation got grimmer as he made boneheaded career choices and weathered a pricey divorce from @entity213			0
by 1996 , the bandit owed $ 10 million to his creditors , and the royalties from " @entity217 " just were n't flowing in quickly enough			0
@entity200 declared chapter 11 bankruptcy , from which he emerged in 1998			1
not only did he not have to sell his trademark mustache at auction to pay his bills , @entity200 even got to keep his @entity209 estate , @entity223			1
this homestead exemption raised the ire of some observers who did n't think hanging on to a $ 2.5 million mansion while writing off $ 8 million in debt was quite in the spirit of bankruptcy laws ' provisions about keeping one 's home			1
in fact , when the @entity235 passed measures tightening these loopholes in 2001 , @entity200 ' keeping his ranch was one of the examples they used to decry bankruptcy proceedings as going too easy on the wealthy			1
" there is no greater bankruptcy abuse than this , " said @entity243 senator @entity242			2
@entity247 when @entity247 was just 25 years old , he and two partners began a company that made horseradish			1
as the legend goes , the spicy root was the first of @entity247 's famed 57 varieties , but it was n't as lucrative as he 'd hoped			1
a business panic in 1875 bankrupted his enterprise , but @entity247 's passion for condiments remained strong			1
the very next year , @entity247 got together with his brother and a cousin to start a new company in @entity264 , @entity187			1
the reorganized group started making ketchup , and the business took off			0
last year the @entity247 had over $ 10 billion in revenue			1
@entity269 famous showman @entity269 was always quick with a quip , but he was n't so snappy about paying back his loans			1
although he was successful showing off oddities in @entity154 and around the globe , @entity269 had a habit of borrowing cash from anyone who would open their wallet for him			1
@entity0 : 12 oddball museums preserving our history he 'd use these funds to buy real estate , particularly around @entity285 , @entity286 , where he was trying to foster industrial development			0
unfortunately for @entity269 , he went too far with borrowed cash , and in 1855 , things bottomed out			1
@entity269 was bankrupt and owed his creditors nearly half a million dollars			1
@entity269 did n't give up , though , and he slowly worked himself out of debt over the next five years			1
the showman gave lectures around @entity294 about showmanship and making money , and he regained control of his main attraction , @entity299 in @entity154 , in 1860			0
in 1871 , just a few months shy of his 61st birthday , @entity269 entered the circus business with @entity269 's @entity302 , and @entity303 , which raked in over $ 400,000 in its first year			1
