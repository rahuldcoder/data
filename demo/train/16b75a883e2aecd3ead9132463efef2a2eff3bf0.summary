-- @entity1 reached the semifinals of the @entity3 for the first time after battling past defending champion @entity5 in three sets tuesday			1

" we both showed some excellent tennis , " said @entity1 , who has the best record on hard courts this season with a 30 - 2 winning margin in @entity20 events			2
" you could feel the pressure all the time			2
we really both gave it all			0
we fought really hard , making each other run like crazy			0
" she will play either @entity30 11th seed @entity28 or @entity31 of @entity32 , who started playing the second quarterfinal before rain ended the rest of tuesday 's schedule			1
" to be in the semifinals of the @entity3 for the first time is incredible			1
i do n't want to stop			0
i 'm going to do absolutely everything i can here , " said @entity1 , who had beaten @entity5 in straight sets in their previous six meetings			1
" she really pushed me to dig deep			0
she kept coming back really strong and keeping me back , and i was n't getting as many opportunities -- i just kept telling myself , ' do n't be a chicken , come on , just go , go for your shots			0
' " @entity1 was two breaks ahead in the first set when the showers hit @entity50 , but did not take long to close it out when the players returned			1
but @entity5 , who sensationally beat @entity53 in last year 's final , was not going to relinquish her crown easily and gained an early break in the second set			2
@entity58 broke back immediately , but dropped her service gain to trail 4 - 3 and could not recover			0
it was the first set she had lost in the final grand slam of the season			0
the final set saw @entity1 twice lead after breaks , but with tension mounting @entity5 twice retrieved the breaks to set up a tiebreaker			1
@entity69 pulled ahead to a 4 - 0 lead , but showing signs of nerves she gave up the advantage as the champion leveled at 5 points each			2
but a clever drop volley on the next point set up @entity1 for match point and she was soon celebrating victory after nearly two and a half hours of quality tennis as @entity5 hit a return wide			1
third seed @entity31 will need to show the resilience she displayed in her previous match against @entity86 if she is to progress to the semifinals in @entity88 since she won the title in 2006			1
the @entity91 champion dropped her serve twice against @entity28 to trail 4 - 0 when play was halted			1
