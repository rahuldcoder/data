two high - value targets			0
@entity5 forces launched dual raids on the northern and eastern coasts of @entity8 over the weekend in the hunt for two alleged terrorists : @entity11 , a suspected @entity13 operative wanted for the deadly 1998 bombings of two @entity5 embassies in @entity8 , and an @entity17 foreign fighter commander named @entity18			1
@entity5 forces snatched @entity11 in the @entity21 capital saturday morning			1
but 3,000 miles away , the plan to catch @entity18 did n't go as planned			0
@entity23 came under heavy fire during their raid and had to retreat -- not knowing whether @entity18 was dead or alive			1
while officials have disclosed some details , many questions remain			0
here are the five key ones : 1			0
what 's next for @entity11 ? he spent 15 years on the run and had a $ 5 million reward on his head			1
but he was captured in less than a minute by @entity36 @entity35 members outside his home in @entity39			1
the @entity40 said the @entity5 military was holding @entity11 in a " secure location " outside @entity21			1
there , a team of officials from the @entity45 , the @entity46 and other intelligence agencies will grill him for intelligence on @entity13			1
eventually , he 'll be taken to @entity50 to face federal charges			0
@entity5 authorities have long wanted @entity11 to stand trial in an @entity5 court for his alleged role in the embassy bombings in @entity57 and @entity58 that left over 200 dead and thousands wounded			1
in december 2010 , @entity21 authorities told a @entity62 committee that @entity11 was living there , even giving a @entity39 address for him			1
but @entity11 had n't been apprehended until now because of the delicate security situation in much of @entity21 , where ex-jihadists -- especially those who once belonged to the @entity67 -- held considerable sway since the ultimate ouster of longtime leader @entity70			1
there 's no extradition treaty between @entity21 and the @entity5			1
and @entity21 's interim government has called @entity11 's capture a " kidnapping			1
" @entity5 secretary of state @entity76 disputes that			1
he described @entity11 as a key @entity13 figure who is a " legal and an appropriate target			1
" @entity76 said monday that @entity11 " will now have an opportunity to defend himself and to be appropriately brought to justice in a court of law			1
" ruthless leader aims to extend reach of @entity17 , eyes the @entity88 2			1
could @entity11 be a treasure trove of information ? that 's the hope , but it might not happen			1
@entity93 , who lost her father and brother in the embassy attack in @entity97 , said she was relieved when @entity98 -- also indicted in the embassy attacks -- was killed in 2011			0
but she 's also happy that @entity100 is in @entity5 hands			2
" certainly , we are very pleased to know that we can have someone who is captured , and for the wealth of information that may be available to our intelligence community and our military personnel , " she said			2
" you ca n't put a price on that			0
" if he talks , @entity100 could offer valuable information on men he worked with inside @entity21 , as well as @entity13 in general			1
" he is a big catch			0
he is going to know about the @entity21 branch of @entity13 , " @entity0 national security analyst @entity114 said			1
" he knows the entire infrastructure of the early days of @entity98			0
catching this guy alive , he 's got a lot to say , a lot -- carrying a lot of phone numbers , all sorts of knowledge			0
" but some think @entity11 probably does n't know much about the current operational details of @entity13			1
" there 's a lot of thought out there that @entity11 may have sort of gone into semi-retirement , " @entity0 @entity40 correspondent @entity127 said			2
" maybe he was in @entity21 , of course , to start an @entity13 operation there , but had sort of moved away over the last 15 years from some of his potential activities			1
" @entity21 counterterrorism analyst @entity137 , a former jihadist associate of @entity100 's , also said his former colleague has been out of the game for a while			2
@entity142 's wife agreed , saying he was living a normal life and was not in hiding			0
she said he actually reapplied for a job with the oil ministry			0
@entity146 said her husband left @entity13 in 1996 and had no connection to the twin 1998 bombings at @entity5 embassies in @entity57 and @entity58			1
" i am sure of what i am saying -- he did not take part in any bombing anywhere in the world , " @entity151 told @entity0 's @entity152			0
" he participated in the jihad in @entity159			0
he was a member of @entity13 and he was personal security for @entity98 -- that 's true -- but he did not take part in any operation			2
" opinion : good thing @entity5 terrorist hunters were n't furloughed 3			2
who is @entity168 ? the target of the @entity5 raid in @entity172 was named @entity168 -- a @entity57 of @entity172 origin , a senior administration official told @entity0			1
he has been on the @entity5 radar for at least three years			2
before dawn saturday , a team of @entity23 zoomed in by speedboat and snuck up on a seaside villa in southern @entity172			1
soon afterward , the sounds of heavy gunfire and several large explosions echoed across the port city of @entity183			0
after coming under fire , the @entity23 made a " prudent decision " to pull back , a senior @entity5 official said			1
they withdrew , unable to confirm whether they killed their target , the official said			0
a recent @entity57 intelligence report alleged that @entity18 was behind several foiled terror conspiracies against targets in @entity57 between 2011 and 2013			0
the most recent was a plot to attack @entity194 in @entity57 's @entity195 in april			0
@entity57 officials said last year that @entity18 had a significant role in recruiting and training @entity57 in @entity17			2
he is thought to have been a close associate of the @entity201 , a fellow @entity57 and senior @entity13 operative in east @entity8 , who was believed to have been connected to the embassy attacks			1
( @entity201 was killed by @entity5 forces in 2009 in @entity172			1
) @entity18 also appears to be close to @entity17 leader @entity204 , who also goes by @entity205			2
@entity17 , of course , is the @entity13 - linked militant group based in @entity172			1
most recently , it made headlines when it claimed responsibility for the days - long deadly attack at @entity57 's upscale @entity210 in @entity97 in september			0
at least 67 people were killed in that siege			0
were the raids a coincidence or were they coordinated ? the two missions have one thing in common : the 1998 embassy bombings			2
@entity142 was wanted for his alleged role in attacks			0
and @entity18 is closely associated with @entity220 , also accused of being part of the attacks			0
but @entity5 officials have not talked specifics about the timing			2
" sometimes that depends on the moment of opportunity			0
you can be watching and then the moment of opportunity comes up and you have to take it , " says @entity0 foreign affairs correspondent @entity229			0
president @entity233 gave his go - ahead and was updated as the operations proceeded			0
the missions , however , are unlikely to help buoy @entity233 as he battles @entity237 amidst a partial government shutdown			0
" i would submit to you right now most @entity5 remain focused on the economy			2
they remain focused on the government shutdown and the upcoming debt ceiling lifting or not lifting , depending on what @entity245 decides to do , " @entity0 chief political correspondent @entity241 said			0
but @entity247 of @entity248 said the missions are a reminder that " even an @entity5 president who is domestically very frustrated wields extraordinary executive powers			2
" @entity5 forces strike in @entity21 , @entity172 5			1
who is next ? the operatives of the 9/11 era are largely dead or captured			2
and key operatives like @entity258 -- an alleged 9/11 mastermind -- are detained at @entity260			0
topping the list of still - wanted is @entity262 , the leader of @entity13			2
with a $ 25 million reward on his head , @entity262 is believed to be hiding in @entity265			0
but some of the biggest targets are part of the new @entity13 affiliates like @entity17 -- including its top leader , @entity205			1
" by formally merging with @entity13 and doing an attack in which @entity5 were targeted , this group has put itself in the sights of the @entity5 , " @entity0 national security analyst @entity271 said			1
the @entity5 is also hunting for other emerging terrorist leaders			2
@entity276 is a one - time @entity98 aide and leader of @entity278 ( @entity278 )			0
the @entity280 - based group is now considered one of the most lethal			0
@entity0 's @entity282 , @entity283 and @entity127 contributed to this report .			0
