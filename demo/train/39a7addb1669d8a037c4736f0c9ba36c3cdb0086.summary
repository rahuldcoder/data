-- @entity1 is calling on a few heroes			0
after the monster box office success of " @entity5 " and other superhero movies in the franchise , the network is hoping some of that same magic can translate to the small screen			1
" @entity14 , " co-created by " @entity5 " writer / director @entity15 -- who also directed the series premiere -- is kicking off a brand new tuesday night lineup for @entity1 this fall , a night which used to be anchored by the " @entity13 " results show			1
@entity18 is back as @entity19 's ( @entity19 ) @entity20 -- one of the main links between the various @entity24 movies -- who is tasked with leading a new team of @entity19 agents to handle the various strange occurrences that happen once aliens invade and a team of heroes battle them in @entity32			1
( think " @entity33 " or " @entity34 " with superheroes			0
) of course , @entity20 's return comes as something of a surprise because ( @entity39 ) he was killed by @entity40 in " @entity5			1
" the premiere contains an explaination of how @entity20 survived -- at least , the explanation as far as @entity20 knows			1
it 's just the first of what 's sure to be several plot twists to be part of the series , in typical @entity50 fashion			2
while @entity15 prepares to direct " @entity5 : age of @entity54 , " he brought in some trusted people to run the show day to day			1
you might just say he trusts them like family : his brother @entity58 and sister - in - law @entity59 ( " @entity60 , " " dr. horrible 's @entity62 " )			1
@entity58 , @entity59 and , separately , @entity18 spoke with @entity0 on the cusp of the show 's premiere			1
@entity0 : so how much fun is it to play in the @entity24 sandbox ? @entity59 : we 've always been fans of the @entity69 , and we 're big fans of the @entity24 movies			1
to be able to play in a universe with such a long history is something we 're very excited about doing			0
@entity50 : you have these really human emotions and predicaments amplified by superhero elements , for us it 's a perfect fit			0
@entity0 : it seems like @entity20 is darn near immortal now			1
how surprising was it to learn of his resurrection ? @entity18 : he 's like a cockroach ; you ca n't kill him off			1
when it came to do that " @entity5 " [ death ] scene , it was an emotional day			1
i had played this part for four movies , and i loved so much what @entity15 had written for that			1
i was n't sad , but i found i was really emotional about it			0
at the end they were saying , " it 's a comic book , so [ he might come back ] , " but i thought , " oh they 're just being nice			0
just trying to smooth my path to the next world			0
" soon after i thought , " well , i guess i need to start dealing with this , do n't i ? " then i get a call from [ " @entity14 " executive producers ] @entity104 and @entity15			1
they say " ok , you might not be so dead			0
here 's what we 're thinking ... " it was such a spectacular take on why i might not be dead			0
and the idea of doing a tv show created by @entity15 -- who created " @entity113 " and " @entity114 , " which i love -- was exciting to me			1
@entity0 : how do you best describe the show ? @entity50 : the show takes place within the @entity24 cinematic universe , but it 's about being a regular person living in that world			1
@entity59 : our tag line is " not all heroes are super			1
" at its core , it is about being human			0
that human experience is amplified because these regular people are coming up against extraordinary things			0
the themes that we 've dealt with on other shows like feeling less than , and wanting to be greater			0
all those things we can explore and dig in even deeper because of what we come up against from week to week			0
@entity0 : what special @entity50 touches will we see ? @entity50 : one of the things @entity15 has always done and we like to do -- and a big part of the @entity24 brand -- is humor throughout			1
we think that one of the reasons the films have been successful is humor brings everyone to the table			0
we love that and we want our characters to be not just interesting , complicated and screwed up -- but funny			0
@entity59 : we think that will marry both audiences			1
@entity24 and @entity1 have distinctly different audiences and we think we can bring those audiences together with humor			1
@entity0 : did you set out to comment humorously on the action as it happens ? @entity50 : there 's an expectation with it being a spy show -- and there 's certain superhero movies that take themselves very seriously -- there 's nothing better than being able to subvert that expectation and comment on it			2
and there 's nothing better to do that than with @entity18 , whose delivery is perfect and whose sense of humor is dry and calm as ever			2
@entity59 : we have a running joke in the room that we will write the worst lines for him , but he 'll pull it off and sound as classy and cool as he is			2
@entity0 : so do you sit back and say , " well , i guess i 'm an action star now ? " @entity18 : i sit in a hot tub , trying to heal my muscles , saying ' well i guess i 'm an action star now , ' with an ice pack next to me			2
@entity0 : how do you get along with your team on the show ? @entity18 : @entity15 has a knack for finding amazing actors who are also really joyful and fun to work with			1
so you think , " here come these young guys , let 's see what they 're like , " and if anything , they could n't be more down for whatever			0
they 're ready to jump in and see what happens			0
i could n't be more impressed with them			0
i think the audience will flip for them			0
@entity0 : what were you looking for in your cast ? @entity50 : we were looking for ugly faces			2
@entity59 : we wanted really ugly people			2
it was n't a conscious thing for us to cast all new faces , honestly			2
we scoured the globe for these people , literally			0
the people we cast were the ones who nailed it and won the part basically			0
@entity50 : and brought something we were looking for , as well as things we did n't know we were looking for			0
@entity0 : the thing people remember from the trailer the most is @entity20 's vintage car , @entity223			2
@entity59 : @entity223 's gotten so much play ! @entity50 : @entity223 travels with the [ @entity19 ] plane , so @entity223 will be in the show			1
@entity223 is an old model , so fuel for @entity223 is very expensive			0
@entity18 : it 's not the only thing @entity20 has a passion about that is a relic of super-high - tech covert ops			1
he 's a bit of a collector that way			0
@entity0 : agent @entity238 ( " @entity240 's " @entity239 ) shows up in the pilot			0
do you hope to work with other familiar faces from " @entity5 ? " @entity18 : i am hoping to see that			1
every time i think " boy , as a fan of @entity24 , would n't it be cool if they exploited the connection between these two things ? , " they 've done it			2
i 'd be a little disappointed if some of our friends from the comics and the movies did n't cross-pollinate into the show , and i 've got a feeling @entity24 's not gon na disappoint the fans in that way			1
@entity59 : we are very open to the opportunity to bring in familiar faces , but at the same time we want the show to exist on its own			1
we are in the same universe as all the movies , so being a part of that universe means bringing in people			0
if they want to come play with us , our door is wide open			0
@entity50 : @entity274 has expressed an interest in doing the show , so at some point , we 're gon na call him on it			2
@entity59 : and say , " hey , do you really wan na do this ? " i think he said he wanted to be like @entity284 's voice in " @entity285			2
" @entity0 : will there be season - long story arcs as we saw on shows like " @entity114 , " and will they connect to the greater @entity24 cinematic universe ? @entity50 : we 're in contact with features at all times , and we think our job is to stay out of their way , between the films , and tee up the things they want us to tee up and deal with the fallout			2
but in terms of our storytelling , we 're gon na have a lot of standalone , episodic stories			0
@entity59 : with our mythology woven through			2
@entity50 : we do n't want people to have to have seen every episode to be able to understand what 's happening , but we also to reward those who do watch			0
@entity0 : what can we look forward to as the season plays out ? @entity18 : there 's more to the story of how @entity20 lives than even @entity20 knows , and you ca n't walk away from that secret			1
@entity59 : it 's definitely a question at the heart of the show that we 'll play out over time , and we hope the journey to the answer will be as satisfying as the answer			1
@entity50 : we want to earn it and spend our time with it , because we feel like there 's a lot of fun to be had there , but we wo n't go so slowly that people ... @entity59 : ... pull their hair out and curse our names on the @entity336			2
@entity50 : everyone knows how much time and money goes into a pilot			0
@entity59 : if they think the pilot is big ... @entity50 : they will not be disappointed in the episodes that follow .			1
