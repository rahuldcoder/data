finally , a strong important voice in the world , the @entity1 , speaks out on behalf of the rights of children and condemns the @entity6 and the bishops for crimes of violence , rape and sexual abuse against children by transferring pedophile priests from parish to parish , withholding documents for prosecution and perpetuating an institutional culture of secrecy and shame			1
what 's truly shameful is that the @entity22 was not itself that strong and important voice , protecting " the least of these			1
" it 's shameful that in spite of @entity28 ' refreshing compassion toward the poor and downtrodden , to date he has not addressed the issue fully			1
pope @entity28 is caught up in the shame and like most of his brother bishops , seems unwilling to say , " enough is enough -- not ever again in our church will one of these little children be harmed			1
" the media have said the church is suffering from a " code of secrecy			2
" @entity40 , the chairwoman of the @entity1 , put it this way : " we think it is a horrible thing that is being kept silent both by the @entity6 itself and in local parishes			1
" as a survivor of rape and violence at the hands of a priest when i was a young girl , i understand that secrecy			1
i went silent at age 7 and became a part of the secret code that no one could unlock in me , because there were always pieces missing			2
for the rest of my childhood i really was n't there			0
i split and left a part of me behind in shame and secrecy			0
it has taken me more than half a lifetime to piece myself back together			2
i was 52 years old and still captivated by the @entity22 when i let the buried " secret " memories emerge			2
his name was @entity70 -- @entity71			0
i must have trusted him when he asked me to crawl up on his lap as he sat watching a movie in an auditorium so long ago			0
he raped me while my mother was in the lunchroom nearby			2
the tragedy here -- among others -- is that @entity80 died before i was strong enough to tell her about that terrible day			2
we missed out on conversations about intimacy and love because i would always shut down and disconnect			0
rape robbed me and my family of so much that mattered -- like truth and honesty between us			0
after high school at age 18 , i entered the convent of the @entity94 in @entity95 , @entity96 , and remained there as a nun for 15 years			0
detaching from the destructive invasion of @entity70 into my body and soul allowed me to hold onto @entity102 and to the sisters i loved			0
very simply , that is how i was able over half a lifetime to remain in the @entity22 until the day i awakened to the tragedy of the little girl whom i once was			2
the @entity108 released 12,000 pages of files on scores of priests accused of sexually abusing children in 2013			1
i found out that the pastor of our parish back in 1947 suspected @entity70 of " touching " little girls			2
it was the bishop who would not listen and passed @entity70 on and on until 2002 , when he was defrocked			0
he had become a real liability to cardinal @entity122 , head of the archdiocese			0
about 33 women accused him of abusing them when they were young			2
that 's five decades of abuse			2
in 2002 , he was charged with 29 counts of molesting girls			0
he was taken off a cruise ship on its way to @entity131 to face the charges ; authorities thought he was trying to flee			0
but his case was dismissed in 2003 after a @entity137 @entity136 ruling that the charges were too old			0
it is easy to think that when we talk about the crisis of child rape and abuse that we are talking about the past -- and the @entity22 would have us believe that this most tragic era in church history is over			1
pedophiles are still in the priesthood			0
coverups of their crimes are happening now , and bishops in many cases are continuing to refuse to turn information over to the criminal justice system			0
cases are stalled and can not go forward because the church has such power to stop them			1
children are still being harmed and victims can not heal			0
these criminal acts happened over and over to tens of thousands of children in the past , continue now and will continue until @entity28 and the bishops act fiercely to insist that children and their safety come first , and that priests and protecting the image and power of the @entity22 come a distant second			1
pope @entity28 must take action and mandate every bishop to immediately defrock any priest who has sexually abused children in the past or in the present and let the civil authorities investigate any priest or bishop alleged to have sexually abused a child			1
nothing else will show the world that the @entity22 is serious about its promise to address this issue			0
pope @entity28 will need to begin at home and release whatever records the @entity6 possesses on priests and bishops accused of these crimes , wherever they are in the world			1
anything short of this speaks of lip service and platitudes			0
@entity28 also needs to chastise and demote bishops guilty of protecting priest abusers and working against the criminal justice system -- not honor and promote them			1
@entity122 was recently honored in celebrating @entity199 with @entity28 -- and yet it is documented that he withheld information and transferred priests within and outside his diocese			1
at least @entity122 acknowledged in a statement in 2013 that he had been " naive " about the lasting impacts of abuse and then met with 90 victims			0
but pope @entity28 ' speeches and actions to date do not reflect a spirit of compassion for , or understanding of , the impact on survivors			1
any positive changes in the @entity22 to protect children and hold the church accountable have come about largely because of the tireless work of @entity219 , @entity219			1
these are brave and courageous men and women who tell their stories of abuse without shame			0
we can also thank the @entity22 community of laypeople who want their children to be safe and their church to become the church it can be : a beacon of hope for its members and the world			1
now , it 's the @entity6 that must take action , as the @entity1 report urges , to show us that its apologies are matched by actions to both stop the abuse of children and the church 's coverup			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity247 .			1

@entity247 : finally , the @entity1 condemned the @entity6 for its *negligence* in priest abuse cases
@entity247 was raped by a priest when she was a young girl and it *shadowed* her life
she says abuse is still secret and the church still protects priests , holds back evidence
@entity247 : @entity28 must take strong action to stop *clergy* abuse of children and coverup
