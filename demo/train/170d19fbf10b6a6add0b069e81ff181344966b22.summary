-- @entity1 became the first @entity3 club to win the @entity4 after a goalless draw away to @entity7 's @entity6 ensured a closely fought 1 - 0 aggregate victory in the tournament final saturday			1
a heroic defensive display and some favorable refereeing ensured striker @entity13 's goal in last week 's first leg at the @entity15 in @entity16 was enough to claim the continent 's most coveted club prize			1
wanderers can now look forward to the @entity20 in @entity21 next month where they could come up against the likes of @entity23 or @entity24 , current champions of @entity26 and @entity28 's leading club competitions respectively			1
the unlikely triumph is all the more remarkable given that the @entity19 were only founded in 2012 and were playing in continental competition for the first time			2
only 14 @entity19 fans were given visas to attend the game in the @entity7 capital , @entity36 , which was played in front of a highly partisan crowd in the @entity39			1
" the game was everything you expect from a final , " explained a delighted @entity19 coach and former @entity41 in quotes carried by the @entity44 website after the match			1
" it is still a little surreal for me as a coach			0
i am sure it will hit home in the next few days when we reflect			0
" i am just proud for these players and our club			0
the first time in the competition , to win it , i think in the future we will really understand how special this run has been and how it was to win this title			1
@entity41 's side have earned a reputation as a mean defensive unit over the course of the competition			1
@entity70 @entity69 was named the player of the tournament after the match and produced a series of spectacular saves in both legs of the final to keep the vastly more experienced @entity6 at bay			2
but the keeper was extremely lucky not to give away a penalty midway through the second half when he cleaned out @entity6 striker @entity82 in the box			2
fortunately for @entity69 , the @entity85 referee did n't point to the spot despite the protestations of incredulous @entity6 players			2
@entity6 's @entity90 coach , @entity89 , lamented the decision from the sidelines but later described being more disappointed by the fact his team were not able to make the most of their chances over both legs			1
" we had bad luck and we had many chances , " @entity89 said			0
" we were the best team over the two games			0
" " if you lose one game when you play bad , you can congratulate the other team			0
but when you play how we played and they play how they played , we feel very bad			0
" " we had a lot of chances but we missed them			0
if the ball does not come to our strikers they can not score and that 's why we have to find a balance between attack and defense			0
