-- eight years after troops in @entity3 were outfitted with new uniforms , the @entity1 is shopping for a different camouflage for its fatigues and equipment			1
the move to a different uniform comes after soldiers , many of them redeploying to @entity3 , began voicing their criticism in the summer of 2009 of the " universal " camouflage pattern , introduced in 2004 and meant to be used in all types of battle environments			1
" they were saying that they did n't think the color selection was very effective for the terrain in @entity3 , " says col. @entity17 , the project manager for @entity18 and @entity19			1
" @entity3 's a really diverse country in geographical terms			1
there are lots of sandy desert areas , but it also has mountainous areas that you would see up in the @entity29			0
it has green irrigated fields that look like @entity32 in the summer			0
it 's a very diverse environment and soldiers would often traverse these different areas in one patrol			2
" the one - size - fits - all approach of the universal pattern was n't working			2
@entity17 says the @entity1 probably knew at the time that the universal pattern would n't be perfect for every environment , but did n't realize how much of a compromise it would have to make			1
out of the negative feedback came a congressional charge for the @entity1 to find a pattern that was " suited to the environment of @entity3			1
" testing began in 2009 and the @entity1 @entity47 ( @entity48 ) found that the universal pattern ranked " in the bottom 10 " compared to the four backgrounds it was tested against			1
a different brand of camouflage called " @entity54 " ranked at the top in the testing , pushing the @entity1 to quickly outfit soldiers with the new uniform pattern			1
most soldiers in @entity3 today are wearing the @entity54 pattern , which has more green and tan hues , according to @entity17			1
despite the positive results of the @entity54 pattern , the @entity1 thought it could do even better , @entity17 says			1
the @entity1 purchase , however , is n't about the latest design in camo fashion , but rather the color coordination and specific pattern placement manufactured by advanced science			1
" the direction that we got from the secretary of the @entity1 and the chief of staff of the @entity1 was , ' yes , answer the congressional direction , but take a more comprehensive look at the @entity1 camouflage need to operate anywhere in the world , ' " @entity17 says			2
this time around , the @entity1 is looking for a family of camouflage patterns that can be used across the globe -- one for the desert , another for a wilderness / jungle environment , and a third transitional variant for " places in the middle , " @entity17 says			1
the patterns would be similar in design but different in color palettes			2
one leading camouflage designer is hoping his bid to create the family of patterns will be the winning one			2
when most people look at a military uniform , they probably see a bit of green here , some tan there and a splash of gray to finish it off -- basically , a mixture of colors with no obvious thought to placement or shape			0
but that perception could n't be further from the reality of the science behind an advanced camouflage pattern			2
although most detail of what goes into making a successful camouflage pattern is proprietary , @entity111 says he uses a mathematical equation , or fractal , to trick the eye into thinking it is seeing something else			2
" the brain will pick up shapes and it basically categorizes anything it sees , " @entity111 says			0
" it says that 's a tree			0
i know what it is and ignore it			0
the brain does this in milliseconds			0
so we insert these fractal patterns into the camouflage so that the brain recognizes it and does n't think what it 's seeing is an anomaly			0
it basically sees the fractal as background noise			0
something that belongs in the environment but does n't need any extra attention			0
" but camouflage as a science was n't always so evolved , having started only about 100 years ago			0
even during @entity151 , some units began the conflict in brightly colored uniforms , making them easy targets for the enemy			0
" it started as naturalistic observation , looking at zebra stripes and leopard prints in the wild and trying to figure out what their purpose was , " says dr. @entity156 , a camouflage expert advising the @entity1 on the technical aspects of their search			2
" very gradually over the years the focus shifted in military camouflage to how the human visual system works			0
" industry bids for the @entity1 uniform project have been submitted and will be put to the test against current @entity175 camouflage patterns such as those already used by the @entity177 and the @entity178			1
@entity17 says that , after extensive testing , his office should be able to present @entity1 leadership with a recommendation by september 2012			1
research is expected to cost less than $ 10 million and is covered under the existing budget , according to @entity17			0
but he could not estimate how much developing the new uniforms would cost , saying it would depend on how quickly the new uniforms were given out .			0

" @entity190 " pattern is not *conducive* to the varied terrain of @entity3
@entity1 officials are looking for a family of patterns that can work in any environment
bids for the project have been submitted and will be put to the test
a recommendation is expected by september 2012
