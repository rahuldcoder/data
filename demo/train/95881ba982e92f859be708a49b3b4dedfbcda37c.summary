@entity0 -- democrats know the history : 2014 is all but certain to be a tough year			2
but there is a sense among some top @entity2 strategists that the political climate is shifting in ways that could keep the midterm climate from turning from bad to disastrous			1
perhaps it is wishful thinking , and it is important -- very important -- to note how things look in april is often not how they turn out come november			0
but @entity2 just in the past week have received a few nuggets of potentially helpful news : * friday 's @entity18 report showing the economy added 192,000 jobs in march			1
* enrollment in the president 's health care plan crossed the 7 million mark at the first big deadline to sign up			1
* a slight but potentially important uptick in president @entity28 's approval rating			1
@entity30 's daily tracking poll had this key midterm barometer at 45 percent on friday , a near 2014 high and up from 39 percent in early february			2
( president @entity32 had a 38 percent approval rating in november 2006 -- his second term midterm election -- and @entity2 gained 30 @entity36 seats )			1
plus , @entity2 - leaning @entity37 are beginning to spend more money , and in a few notable cases testing a new strategy of punching directly back at the source of millions of dollars in conservative spending that helped turn the early 2014 climate decidedly in favor of the @entity45			1
not that @entity2 should be popping -- or even ordering -- champagne			1
to be clear , top party strategists still expect to lose seats in both the @entity36 and the @entity49			0
the goal , though , is to keep the @entity36 losses to single digits and to deny @entity45 the net gain of six seats the @entity45 needs to take control of the @entity49			2
the principal driver of midterm election seasons is the president 's approval rating ; the closer the incumbent gets to 50 percent , the better democrats feel about avoiding a november bloodbath			1
and any president benefits when people feel better about the economy , which is where the new jobs report , and the immediate debate about its meaning , comes in			1
the 192,000 new jobs was a bit below the consensus estimates , so @entity45 were quick to label it not good enough			1
" our economy still is n't creating jobs for the @entity79 people at the rate they were promised , " house speaker @entity74 said in a statement			2
too early to run @entity83 victory lap democrats , however , focused on the trend line			1
the economy added 533,000 jobs in the first three months of 2014			0
by contrast , job growth in all of 2010 -- a disastrous midterm election year for @entity2 -- was barely above 1 million			1
back then , it was a punishing summer slump that shaped the fall election mood -- so given recent history , it would be a mistake for @entity2 to invest too much hope in this year 's first quarter			1
but the early betting is that the job market in this midterm year will be stronger , and less volatile , than in 2010			0
turning the health care political tide is tougher , but one @entity2 pollster @entity102 argues must become a strategic imperative			1
as noted recently in an analysis produced by the @entity45 polling firm @entity107 , opponents of the health care law are more likely to cite it as a major factor in their 2014 voting decisions			0
that " intensity gap " is the major source of @entity45 midterm optimism			0
@entity102 , in a memo released thursday , argues that @entity2 need to reshape the health care terrain			1
" when the debate is between implementing or repealing the ( @entity83 ) , the intensity shifts towards implementing the law , " the veteran @entity2 pollster says			1
" so it is possible that @entity2 will be able to turn the debate			2
" inside politics : @entity45 responds to @entity83 enrollment with new repeal plan also worth watching is a growing @entity2 effort to create a 2014 political bogeyman out of the @entity128 brothers			1
it was n't all that long ago that veteran @entity2 rep. @entity131 was contemplating retirement			2
now , though , the @entity133 congressman is in the middle of an experiment @entity2 hope helps them minimize their midterm losses			1
@entity138 is @entity131 's @entity45 opponent			0
but turn on a tv in the @entity140 and you ca n't miss a rugged coal miner warning " @entity144 billionaires " are trying to defeat @entity131			0
translation : the @entity128 brothers , the conservative megadonors whose spending spree has @entity2 candidates across the country on their heels			2
now , @entity2 leaning groups are fighting back by making the @entity128 's an issue -- labeling them a rich special interest group trying to get the best @entity156 money can buy			1
in addition to @entity133 , the @entity157 is running ads attacking the @entity128 brothers in @entity160 's 2nd @entity140 , where @entity2 rep. @entity161 faces a tough reelection climate			1
already the @entity128 brothers were an issue in several @entity49 campaigns , again as @entity2 - leaning groups try to improve an election climate in which the early spending by the @entity128 's , primarily through an organization called @entity169 , has improved @entity45 prospects			1
the @entity171 is attacking the @entity128 brothers in five states with key @entity49 races : @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity178			0
@entity169 has spent millions in those states and elsewhere attacking democrats for supporting @entity28 's health care law			2
the version running in @entity175 urges voters to consider , " those behind the attacks -- insurance companies and out of state billionaires			0
" @entity188 target another @entity2 senator it 's a somewhat risky strategy -- using precious advertising resources to attack someone not on the ballot			1
but more and more democrats think it is worth the effort			0
rep. @entity197 , chairman of the @entity198 , said the @entity128 's heavy spending and the frequent national media attention it receives makes them a legitimate target			0
" the @entity128 brothers are becoming their own brand , " @entity203 said in a conversation this week			0
@entity2 strategist @entity206 concurs -- and drew a parallel to his 2012 work for a @entity209			2
" nobody had heard of @entity211 either , until we told them about it , " @entity206 said			0
" of course the @entity2 are wise to tell voters about the controversial billionaires			2
... what did @entity218 say to you when someone said something hateful ? ' consider the source , ' " he said			0
but veteran @entity45 ad guru @entity224 is n't so sure			0
years ago , @entity224 says one of his favorite ad targets was @entity227 , then the @entity228 leader			0
" beat the hell out of him , " @entity224 said			0
" problem is , he was n't on the ballot			0
" to @entity224 , the direct aim at the @entity128 brothers proves " the @entity235 today is exhausted			0
it 's a tactical party , trying to eke out victories on demographics and negative assaults			0
" democrats , not surprisingly , disagree			0
they argue the @entity128 " bogeyman " strategy is helping their candidates and with fund - raising			0
more broadly , the @entity2 bottom line can be summed up this way : the year is still likely to be rough , but that the terrain in early april looks a bit less treacherous than it did in early march .			2

democrats are banking on a boost from good @entity83 and jobs report figures
an improvement in the president 's approval rating could help @entity2 in midterms
democrats are hoping to *salvage* anticipated congressional losses
@entity2 hope a *backlash* against big donors will help election efforts
