@entity0 -- in a room which once served as the residence of the painter @entity4 at @entity0 's @entity5 , one of rock 's most engaging and enduring entertainers is having a little trouble recovering his hearing			1
visibly though , @entity12 shows no after - effects from last night 's gig at the city 's @entity15			1
at 66 he looks in great shape -- yet a glance at his hell - raising musical resume tells you it 's a wonder he 's here at all			1
the early reviews of the show at @entity0 's @entity23 ( curated this year by @entity24 ) speak of his boundless , youthful energy as he bounds on to the stage like a jack - in - the box who 's just escaped the confines of the toy cupboard , cajoling , teasing and captivating his audience with the skills of the consummate showman			1
" there 's a lot of craft , " he says			2
" everything from learning the different parts of the room to reading the reactions to ultimately			0
you 're like a funnel or a vacuum cleaner			0
you 're a transformer between all the energy of the group and its music and the different energies of all the people in the different parts of the room			2
what 's really happening when it 's good is that everybody 's flowing into each other 's presence , maybe through the medium of a particular riff or a particular chorus but also a monkey -- a well - rehearsed monkey , " he laughs			1

among the less notorious antics , are his trademark topless performance and an affinity to stage - dive into his audience			2
" the first time i did it i was 21 years - old and i was opening for @entity77 who was great and we were just a local band in a psychedelic bar room , " he recalls			1
in those days , he tells me , they would be lucky to get a sympathy fee of $ 50			0
" but we were cute kids and we got to play with everybody and i thought it was my job to make sure that when we played no - one forgot about us			2
i did that thing that little kids do when they 're not getting enough attention from their parents , they just fall forward and wait for maybe somebody to catch ' em. and i would just step off the stage and inspect the audience			0
" forty - five years later and he 's still at it			1
" last year i did a couple of big dives and i got a couple of stitches because i always overdo it			2
and at this stage i just fall in once in a while and say " hi " and it 's fine -- just a gentle collapse is okay ! " but some things have changed since those early days : the after - show party today is an altogether calmer affair , in the company of his third wife @entity110 , a nice bottle of @entity112 and " lots of desserts			1
" " and someone will draw my bath and sleep will come hard			0
there 's some element i do with @entity120 ... the hardcore stuff			1
it 's a bit like being a prize fighter , there 's a lot of nervous energy and you wake up sore			1
" pop is currently touring @entity130 with @entity120 , having recorded " ready to die " -- only their fifth album in 45 years			1
his parents named him @entity135 but playing in a band called the @entity137 led to the nickname " @entity12 " and an apparent similarity to a local character named " pop " provided the rest			1
in the early days , he says , he became known as " the man you love to hate " and today he 's most commonly billed as the " @entity145 " -- a term with which he 's uncomfortable			1
" at first it was just a really embarrassing tag and then it got to be funny and then i just gave up			0
i 've been called lots of things and it 's nice to have lots of titles			2
i 'm waiting for @entity155 laureate -- no - one 's nominating me so i 'm putting it out there			1
" pop 's musical career has been supplemented by a long association with movies both as an actor and musician			2
tracks such as " @entity166 , " " @entity167 , " " @entity168 " and " @entity169 " have appeared on the soundtracks to almost 150 movies and tv series			0
this summer he 'll be played by @entity63 ' drummer @entity174 in the film " @entity182 , " about the legendary @entity177 music club frequented by the likes of the @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity181			0
but an unexpected acting connection revealed itself during @entity12 's visit to @entity0			1
" @entity186 " star @entity185 has confessed to being a huge fan of @entity12 and was reported as saying that playing his idol on screen was his ultimate dream			1
pop tells me @entity185 attended last night 's gig and the singer seems delighted to be reaching a new generations of fans			2
" i think it would be great if everybody played me , " he says			0
" yeah , come on kid play me ! i think it 's wonderful it 's a gift that anyone would think of me			2
" however there 's one actor in particular with whom @entity12 has developed a strong musical bond and friendship -- although it did n't start out that way			1
" @entity209 was in a couple of bands in the @entity213 area -- i think @entity214 and @entity215 -- and apparently once when i was in my wildest phase i played in @entity217			0
he came to the club , he tells me he tried to meet me and tell me about his band and i said : ' shut up you little turd '			2
" happily , the relationship survived this first awkward encounter			0
" since then we 've played and we 've jammed on and off			0
he 's a very sensitive guitarist , he has a really nice intonation , attack and a really nice sense of music			0
and we recorded one thing together years ago called ' @entity232 ' and we played once on @entity234 telly			0
" fans of both @entity209 and @entity12 have a chance to hear their latest collaboration on the soundtrack of @entity209 's new film " @entity240 " ( @entity209 plays the masked lawman 's native @entity242 character @entity244 ) with a rendition of the traditional @entity247 - era song " @entity248			1
" " he called up about this and i think it was late in the game and he did n't have a great cut and with about two weeks to go he said : ' come on , we got ta get this together so choose a song			0
' so i tried writing something but it 's not my style and ' @entity248 ' is just a great great great song and he plays beautifully on it			0
i just had a great time doing that			0
" with close friends @entity263 and @entity265 continuing to stir up the music business and contemporaries @entity268 reaching new musical milestones , @entity12 remains one of rock 's great survivors			1
" what 's interesting is that for people of our generation that matured in the 1960s , people still seem to be interested			0
i got to think there was some sorta bump in the quality in that period ' 65 -- ' 75			0
it 's pretty much a given that a decent , or better than decent , musician or songwriter is gon na keep doing it in some way throughout their life			0
