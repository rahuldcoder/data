-- @entity2 agencies have warned some employees that reading the classified @entity5 documents released by @entity6 puts them at risk of losing their jobs			1
but what about students considering jobs with the federal government ? do they jeopardize their chances by reading @entity6 ? it 's a gray area , said law professors and national security experts who spoke with @entity0			1
the topic has been debated intensely in the past week in legal and academic circles , ever since several @entity2 universities sent e-mails to students with warnings about reading leaked documents			1
they say students ought to be mindful of their future careers when commenting on or distributing the documents online -- especially those planning to seek jobs in national security or the intelligence community , which require a security clearance			1
" the security clearance asks whether or not you 're a risk when it comes to sensitive material			1
this could be one indicator that , when taken together with others , creates a broader pattern that might suggest you 're not a person to be hired , " said @entity39 law professor @entity38 , who specializes in national security law			2
" they may very well take into account your opinion , as a job candidate , whether or not you think @entity6 is a good thing or bad thing for the country , " he said			2
" it 's a small issue , but one to approach with caution if i were a student seeking a job in the national security field			0
" e-mails went out last week to students at several schools , including @entity62 's @entity61 , @entity64 's @entity63 and @entity66 's @entity65 , cautioning students against commenting on or posting links to the documents on social media sites such as @entity71 or @entity72			1
each message came from the schools ' offices of career services , claiming to be sent at the recommendation of an alumnus			0
in the eyes of the federal government , the documents remain classified , " thus , reading them , passing them on , commenting on them may be seen as a violation of @entity86 , @entity87 , " said @entity88 , @entity62 law assistant dean for career development and public services , in an e-mail to students			2
" two big factors in hiring for many federal government positions are determining if the applicants have good judgment and if they know how to deal with confidential / classified information , " @entity88 said in the memo , which was posted on the law blog " @entity95 " last week			1
a @entity62 spokeswoman confirmed that the e-mail had been sent , adding that students are " free to make their own choices			0
" " @entity108 thought it prudent to alert our students to the possible ramifications of dealing with classified information , especially in light of the fact that law graduates often apply for jobs that require security clearances , " @entity106 said in an e-mail			1
so , can just reading about the leaked documents in the media jeopardize your chances of getting a job with the federal government ? probably not , said @entity38			1
but commenting on them online or distributing them might create a pattern of behavior that raises red flags during screening for the highest levels of security clearance , which often require polygraph tests			1
" i do n't think looking at them alone could hurt anyone			0
the problem is when you 're looking and then supporting and endorsing , then you start running into trouble			0
that 's where you run the risk of jeopardizing the security clearance on character grounds , " he said			1
it also serves as a reminder to be mindful of your " online and personal profile , " your virtual footprint of statements , comments and shared materials stored in the web 's collective consciousness , the professor said			0
" when you 're up against so many others for the same competitive job , you do n't want to stand out for this			0
@entity158 would dictate , do n't add another possible reason for them to ding you			0
" nor should the school 's warnings necessarily be construed as policy endorsement , said @entity166 professor @entity165 , co-founder of the school 's @entity167			0
" i imagine the distribution of these warnings is less to endorse the policy and more just to say , ' hey this is what we 're hearing			0
' this is not like advising students to not smoke pot. it 's not weighing in on a matter of policy			0
it 's just telling them that it might affect them down the road , " he said			0
but to the government agency hiring you , there could be a big difference between just reading about the documents in the news and actively disseminating them or seeking them out in their full form on @entity6 ' site			1
" it 's a new situation , and the documents are so ubiquitous right now that it seems weird to worry who on the margin has ever posted a link to them			0
but at the same time , the initial release was against the law , so i ca n't begrudge the government , when figuring out who to employ or trust with secrets , to ask if you helped to further spread documents that belonged to the government			0
" after the issue went viral last week on " @entity95 " and " the @entity214 , " which posted an e-mail to students at @entity66 's @entity65 , the blogosphere lit up with comments from readers calling the practice unconstitutional and a violation of free speech rights			0
many suggested the warning was over the top and added another layer of anxiety for job - seekers in a weak job market			0
an unscientific survey on " @entity95 " asked readers what they thought : 55 % said the warnings were needlessly scaring law students , 38 % said a little over the top but a prudent thing to consider in a difficult job market and 9 % said spot on , even reading the stuff could get you in trouble			2
but would it be illegal for the @entity5 to deny anyone a job based on statements about @entity6 ? the answer is unclear , but in the private sector , inquiries from prospective employers about your ability to handle confidential material would be considered " legitimate business concerns , " labor lawyer @entity245 said			1
" the framework of the issue goes back to whether the employer has a legitimate concern about your fitness for the position , " said @entity245 , a @entity254 - based attorney who has represented large employers , including the @entity2 @entity256 and @entity257			2
" i can understand how an employer in the federal government would believe that someone who once engaged in that kind of conduct , with the understanding that the information was confidential , how that reflects upon their potential for handling confidential info in the future			1
" the e-mail from @entity66 's @entity65 told students that posting links or making comments about the documents online would " call into question your ability to deal with confidential information , which is part of most positions with the federal government			1
" on monday , the school issued a follow - up , saying that said it supported students ' right to " discuss and debate any information in the public arena that they deem relevant to their studies or to their roles as global citizens " without fear of consequences			2
" @entity300 e-mailed this cautionary suggestion to students , as it has done many times with other information that could be helpful in seeking employment after graduation			2
we know that many students share a great deal about their lives online and that employers may use that information when evaluating their candidacy , " @entity307 said in a statement			1
" should the @entity2 @entity5 issue any guidelines relating to the @entity6 documents for prospective employees , @entity65 will make them available immediately			1
" the @entity2 government 's position on @entity6 has been clear since november 28 , when the site began posting anonymously leaked @entity5 documents			1
the @entity324 administration has condemned the disclosures , arguing that they harm @entity2 diplomacy by exposing confidential communications			1
the site has been kicked off servers in the @entity2 and @entity330 and lost a major revenue source on friday when the @entity2 - based @entity332 cut off its account			2
the @entity334 also sent a memo forbidding unauthorized federal government employees and contractors from accessing the classified documents on the @entity6 site or other websites on government or personal computers			1
the memo , sent to federal workers and contractors without official federal government authorization to read the documents , said that just because the documents have been published on the internet does not change their " classified status " or " automatically result in declassification			2
" " classified information , whether or not already posted on public websites or disclosed to the media , remains classified , and must be treated as such by federal employees and contractors , until it is declassified by an appropriate @entity357 authority , " the memo said			1
what 's less clear is the government 's official position on whether potential recruits should avoid @entity6			2
a spokeswoman for the @entity334 would not comment on the issue			0
but a look at the @entity365 form 86 -- the questionnaire all applicants for national security positions must fill out -- sheds light on the risks the government wants to avoid			2
questions related to past associations , such as have you ever " knowingly engaged in activities designed to overthrow the @entity357 by force " or " engaged in acts of terrorism " are intended to evaluate whether you could pose a security risk , said @entity38 , the @entity39 law professor			0
the big concern for universities , which are supposed to be incubators for lively debate and the exchange of ideas , is the chilling effect the warnings may have , said @entity165 , the @entity166 professor			0
" i would hate to see the policy extended so broadly that you have students scared to read newspapers , " @entity165 said			0
" what i hope no one would want to do is ask if you read an article about the documents and hold that against you			0
they 're out there so it might be quite natural to read something about them			0

@entity2 colleges warn students to not comment on , post links to @entity6 on social media sites
doing so calls into question " ability to deal with confidential information , " memo says
experts : statements may affect chances of getting security clearance for government jobs
some say schools are *overreacting* ; others say warning is prudent advice
