-- it 's not as achingly hip as @entity2 and it 's more manageable than @entity3 : @entity5 's third city has plenty of flavor , an urban edge and uniquely @entity10 oddities			1
from medieval cathedrals to @entity14 's futuristic @entity13 , @entity11 packs in plenty			1
where else could you glimpse the @entity18 in the morning , gorge on paella on a @entity22 beach for lunch and then wander along a old river bed transformed into a park and visit architectural blockbusters that look like a @entity28 vision of a colonized planet ? after an early morning shot of coffee and , depending on your sugar tolerance , churros , the @entity35 in the heart of the old city is the best place to start the day			1
located on the @entity40 , the cathedral is an impressive mix of gothic , baroque and @entity44 architectural styles			1
as striking as the many parts of the cathedral are , the sight of the @entity18 my leave you underwhelmed -- to the unenlightened it resembles something closer to a plastic mug circa			0
if you 're in town on a thursday , catch the enactment of a tradition almost as old as the grail			0
the @entity57 , or @entity58 , is the meeting of the city 's elders , who gather outside the cathedral 's @entity62 for around twenty minutes			1
it generally involves a number of old men sitting down not doing very much , while one pronounces what has been decided , and it 's a bit of a tour - group hot spot			2
on the other side of the plaza is the octagonal @entity72 , where you can climb 207 steps for a panoramic view of the low - rise old city			2
not far through the old city 's happy tangle of narrow streets is the @entity80 : a fifteenth - century trading house , studded with a fine collection of mugging gargoyles now preserved under @entity85 status			1
bringing yourself out of the city 's medieval landmarks , you can feast on modern culture at @entity89 , the city 's cheap and excellent modern art gallery			1
but for a vision of the future as designed by local superstar architect @entity14 , wander along the city 's old river bed towards @entity96			1
it 's made up of four gleaming white architectural confections , including the @entity100 concert hall , which is covered in cracked white tiles that glisten in the sunlight			2
a few minutes away is the final piece of the architectural dreamscape , the @entity105 -- one of the world 's biggest aquariums			2
with two shark tunnels , beluga whales , walruses and thousands of fish it should sate anyone looking for a glimpse of the life aquatic			0
the @entity22 itself is not far away , and public transport in @entity119 is a convenient way to get around town when things get out of comfortable walking distance			0
to get to the beach from the center of town hop on a tram on line 5 from @entity129 towards @entity130			2
when there you 'll find a beachside strip of hotels and paella restaurants offering versions of the city 's most famous culinary dish			1
the area was scrubbed up when @entity119 hosted the @entity140 , sailing 's blue riband event , in 2007			0
beyond the rice and seafood delights and the anodyne redeveloped area by the docks , the beach bar of @entity144 offers some choice classy cocktails			0
to be extra chilled , snag one of the massage therapists walking along the promenade for a bargain 10 euro beach massage or reflexology session			2
back in town , the covered market of the @entity158 is a must , not just for foodies , but for people - watching			0
the beautiful modernista building was constructed in 1928 -- look out for the green parrot weathervane			0
eating and drinking in the city is a rich experience			0
tapas is ubiquitous , but make sure you try horchata -- a sweet local specialty made from a mix of water , sugar and ground tigernut			0
among the city 's numerous specialist bars serving the cooling drink , the @entity175 provides some fine mixes in a traditional tiled interior			1
for late night drinks the bars and cafes around @entity184 are popular with locals and visitors -- @entity187 , housed in an opulent old pharmacy , is a prime spot for people watching at any time of day or night and a little further away , @entity191 is buzzy and friendly on the @entity192			0
summers in the city are blistering , with mid-autumn and spring the best seasons to visit			0
but it 's every march that @entity198 exhibit the @entity5 love for a street party during the @entity202 festival			1
its origins are a bit murky , harking back to pagan rituals , but today it 's a noise fest , with daily processions and ear - splitting fireworks set off through the city 's streets , even during the daytime			1
the biggest daily barrages take place in the @entity214 -- the city 's main square			1
out of season some of the effigies and floats built during previous festivals can be seen year round at the @entity222 on @entity223			0
@entity0 's @entity224 contributed to this report			0

@entity13 is @entity14 's architectural *masterpiece*
old city center can be *explored* by foot ; city 's river was transformed into a park
chill out with a massage on the beach ; light up at the @entity202 festival
