@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 and @entity4 each faced questions heading into @entity8 's @entity7 final in @entity1			1
for @entity3 , how would his tender back hold up ? for @entity4 , would he recover after a tough -- and contentious -- loss to his higher - profile @entity8 at the @entity11 in @entity12 last week ? we got our answers friday at the @entity16 @entity15 on a record setting day in @entity0 -- but for once @entity3 was n't the one rewriting the history books			1
in front of the largest ever tennis crowd for a pro match -- at 27,432 it eclipsed the 27,200 that turned up to watch @entity24 beat the @entity25 in a converted @entity27 bullring in the 2004 @entity7 final -- @entity3 not only fell to @entity29 but could n't put up much of a fight			1
the 6 - 1 6 - 4 6 - 3 result against @entity29 -- who piped down his histrionics -- marked his most lopsided defeat in 45 singles matches in the competition			1
" you accept the fact that you 're playing the way you feel , " @entity3 told reporters			2
" but it was n't all negative			0
i started to feel better as the match went on			0
that 's very encouraging , i must say			0
" also encouraging for @entity3 and the @entity8 , @entity4 thumped a listless @entity43 6 - 1 3 - 6 6 - 3 6 - 2 to begin the day			1
@entity3 's performance , coupled with @entity1 's apparent advantage in saturday 's doubles , means it 's the home team who 'll be happier come the end of play			1
one of the two major titles to elude @entity3 in his glittering career is a @entity7 crown and how disappointed he must have been that on his debut in a @entity7 final he was at less than full strength			1
@entity29 , however , remains one of the most athletic players in the game and owned a pair of wins over @entity3			1
with @entity1 captain @entity62 able to rein him in during changeovers , he played focused tennis			2
" definitely one of the top three matches in my life , " said @entity29 , who squandered two match points against @entity3 at the @entity66			1
@entity29 broke early in the first and facing an immediate break point , struck a courageous second - serve ace that delighted his many fans			2
@entity74 can be classified as the least forgiving of surfaces when it comes to unforced errors , which made @entity29 ' tally of 44 winners and 18 unforced errors extremely impressive			2
in truth at times he was quick to pounce on short @entity3 balls			0
he earned the key break at 2 - 2 in the third in breath - taking fashion , slamming a forehand down the line and later in the game sliding into his backhand prior to sending it past @entity3 and down the line			2
and what a way to end it : @entity29 produced another shot down the line , a backhand from a difficult angle			0
@entity4 , meanwhile , sparkled against @entity1 @entity98 , displaying some of the artillery that won him the @entity101 in january for a maiden grand slam title			1
his stats were even better than @entity29 ' -- 61 winners and 29 unforced errors			0
" i know how to play those matches , " @entity4 said			0
" i did so many big matches , so many important matches this year			0
" today it 's important to show them that i 'm there			0
they ( were ) maybe too focused ( on ) @entity3 and maybe they forgot about me			0
" he showed no after effects of the loss to @entity3 , when he blew four match points and was reportedly taunted by @entity3 's wife , @entity118			2
for large parts of the affair he targeted @entity43 's backhand with his own sublime one - handed backhand , easily getting the better of the 2008 @entity101 finalist			2
at one stage , even the crowd -- most of course were rooting for @entity126 -- admired @entity4 's laser - like backhand in reply to a slack tsonga forehand volley			1
@entity4 stormed to the first set and when he held a break point to begin the second , it appeared as if the @entity8 no. 2 's better form would see him cruise in three			1
but @entity43 hung on , altered the momentum and for a brief spell in the third set was in the ascendancy			0
the loudest the crowd got in the opener was in that third set , when an agitated @entity43 implored them off their feet when he saved a set point with an ace at 2 - 5			1
the outstretched arms of @entity62 at precisely the same time suggested an expression of , ' it 's about time , ' and the @entity8 cow bells were temporarily silenced			0
there 's no doubt that @entity4 was slightly rattled			0
@entity43 smelled blood when @entity4 trailed 0 - 30 on serve , but the latter rallied to close out the set -- and the match , realistically -- despite double faulting on one of his set points			1
@entity43 was annoyed with his performance but also with the @entity1 fans , who he felt were n't vocal enough			1
" when the teams were introduced , they applauded @entity4 more than us , @entity3 more than us , " he said			1
" we hear the @entity8 spectators more than we hear the @entity1 ones			1
" @entity4 , for example , announced that the ball was out , and it was in			0
" i just went to check the mark , and i was booed in my own country -- maybe not by the @entity1 spectators but by the @entity8 spectators			1
" with @entity29 ' victory over @entity3 , it guaranteed so - called ' live ' action sunday and @entity62 would surprise a few if he stuck with the out - of - sorts @entity43 to begin the reverse singles			1
for the time being , @entity3 is n't ruling himself out of saturday 's doubles			0
" now i 'm coming out of the match without any pain , which is good , too , " said @entity3			2
" it was not a five - setter ( that left ) me totally exhausted			0
so if i have to find something positive about it , i 'll say that			0
" but it is clear that i want to play better			0
if i play the doubles and the singles , it needs to be a lot better than today			0
now i have the information and i know exactly what i have to do			0
" @entity4 and @entity3 both are n't scheduled to play doubles but they can be called upon saturday .			2

@entity8 and @entity1 are tied after the opening day of the @entity7 final in @entity0
@entity4 crushes @entity43 to give @entity8 a 1 - 0 advantage
but then @entity29 defeats a *potentially* ailing @entity3 in the second singles
more than 27,400 turned up on the day , the largest tennis crowd for a pro match
