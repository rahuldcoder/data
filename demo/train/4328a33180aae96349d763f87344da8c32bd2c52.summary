@entity0 -- @entity3 president @entity2 and other world leaders are set to address a host of pressing economic and military security issues this weekend as the @entity3 hosts a high stakes @entity9 summit outside @entity0 and a @entity11 summit in @entity12			1
a user 's guide to the @entity12 @entity11 summit the three - day diplomatic marathon kicked off friday morning with remarks by @entity2 on the rising concern over global food security			1
@entity2 outlined a new international effort to address hunger in @entity22 and elsewhere , calling it a moral , economic and security imperative			2
the failure to adequately address the issue is " an affront to who we are , " he declared			0
@entity2 also met at the @entity29 on friday with new @entity31 president @entity30 , who was elected on a platform opposing increasingly unpopular eurozone austerity measures			2
" much of our discussion centered on the situation in the eurozone , " @entity2 noted			2
" president @entity30 and i agree that this is an issue of extraordinary importance not only to the people of @entity42 but also to the world economy			2
" @entity11 invites @entity44 to @entity12 summit leaders of most of the @entity9 -- made up of the @entity3 , @entity31 , the @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 -- were meeting later friday and saturday at the @entity54 presidential retreat in @entity55			1
debate is expected to focus on whether an economically weakened , debt - laden @entity42 should continue down the road of austerity trumpeted by @entity48 chancellor @entity59 or focus more on economic stimulus to help the continent grow its way out of the current crisis			1
hanging over the deliberations is the fate of economically battered @entity66 , which has been unable to form a new elected government			0
many analysts believe that @entity69 will be forced to exit the euro currency shortly , which could further rattle global economic confidence			0
" @entity66 must stay in the eurozone , " @entity30 insisted during his meeting with @entity2			2
we all " must do what we can to that effect			0
" the @entity9 leaders are also expected to discuss the standoff over @entity80 's nuclear program and the bloody conflict in @entity82 , where at least 9,000 people have died over the past 14 months , according to @entity84 estimates			1
in recent days , violence has spilled over into @entity86 and @entity87 , where thousands of @entity82 have fled			0
@entity52 president @entity88 will not attend the @entity9 meeting , which makes significant progress on either @entity82 or @entity80 unlikely			1
@entity52 has been at odds with the @entity3 and other @entity9 countries over exactly how hard to crack down on @entity93 and @entity94			0
later this weekend , the war in @entity96 is expected to dominate discussions at the @entity11 summit			1
@entity96 president @entity99 and @entity44 president @entity100 are both expected to attend the meeting			1
opinion : why ordinary @entity96 worry about @entity11 summit @entity11 leaders are currently on a timetable to withdraw all of the alliance 's combat troops from @entity96 in 2014			1
one of the key issues to be discussed in @entity12 is who will pay to build up @entity96 security forces during and after the @entity11 drawdown			1
@entity96 national security forces should total around 350,000 by 2015 , according to @entity1 national security analyst @entity113			0
@entity99 's government can afford to cover only a fraction of the cost , which is expected to total roughly $ 4 billion annually after 2014 , @entity113 notes			0
@entity11 's @entity118 future unclear another issue is @entity121 's continued blockade of much - needed @entity11 supplies over @entity44 roads to @entity96			1
@entity44 has kept its airspace open but closed its ground routes after the death of about two dozen @entity44 soldiers in november at the hands of @entity11 forces at a post on the @entity96 - @entity44 border			2
@entity11 insists that the incident was an accident			0
@entity2 officials are also pushing for more @entity44 involvement in peace talks with the @entity137			0
protests are expected near the sites of both the @entity9 and @entity11 summits this weekend			1
" we expect the worst and hope for the best , " said @entity141 , an official with the @entity12 @entity142			0
that " is the way to characterize how the weekend plays out			0
