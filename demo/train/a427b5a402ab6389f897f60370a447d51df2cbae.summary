-- you know what happens in " taken 2 , " do n't you ? the same thing that happened four years ago in @entity5 , but different			1
) directed by @entity7 tough - stuff transporter 3 specialist @entity8 , the movie is simultaneously silly , nasty , a lazy festival of stereotypes , and a cleverly made piece of merchandise â € ” i.e. , it 's the devil we know			1
this time the blithely violent revenge thriller takes place in @entity18 , which , like @entity20 in the original , is infested with evil stubbled @entity22 gangsters			0
and now it 's retired @entity24 intel pro @entity23 ( @entity26 ) and his ex-wife , @entity29 ( @entity28 ) who get taken too			1
miraculously , the couple 's singularly hostage - prone daughter , @entity33 ( @entity30 ) , avoids captivity , and even proves a worthy bad - guy opponent , primarily through the use of her near - magic @entity37			1
by the way , the chief evil stubbled @entity22 gangster , @entity38 ( @entity39 , who is @entity40 ) , wants revenge because @entity23 killed his son in the previous movie after that son kidnapped @entity23 's daughter to force her into prostitution			2
suffice it to say , things do not go well for @entity38			0
chained up and locked away along with his ex-missus , @entity23 , with his very specialized set of skills , nevertheless wriggles free			0
then , on the way to rescuing his ex , he alternately beats the crap out of people , shoots the crap out of people , runs the crap over people , and growls the crap out of people			0
anyone who thinks any of the above constitutes a spoiler is not the audience for the phenomenon of the " taken " oeuvre , a pair of icy - eyed movies laid over a gooey core of aspirational family bonding			0
in these films , by sheer dint of will , strategic career planning , and physical training sessions suited to his now 60 - year - old chassis , @entity26 sets himself the goal of becoming a @entity82 - like action hero			1
and this he does : he 's sturdy , solid , efficient , opaque , and wears a black leather jacket well			2
he 's an action hero			2
( seems like a waste of a career arc to me , but guess who 's the millionaire ? ) the apex of the star 's work here is when he manages not to betray a giggle when directed to whisper into the phone to the perpetually edge - of - panicked @entity30 , '' your mother and i are going to be taken			2
listen to me very carefully			0
'' as @entity97 almost said in " @entity98 , " to be taken once may be regarded as a misfortune ; to be taken twice looks like carelessness			0
