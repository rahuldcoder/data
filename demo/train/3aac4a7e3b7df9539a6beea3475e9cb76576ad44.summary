" the flight attendants give me ice packs			1
" millions share @entity14 's anxiety , and the fear can be debilitating			1
many turn to professional therapy			1
others try to resolve their fears themselves ; some have more success than others			1
experts caution that it 's hard to pin down a precise number of people who suffer from a fear of flying , without a recent comprehensive survey			1
also , many are reluctant to share details of their phobia -- or how disruptive it can be			2
@entity14 , who rose to fame as one of @entity47 's girlfriends on the reality show " @entity49 , " turns to the cocktail cart to calm her nerves			1

' " he missed that trip to @entity104 , where he would have visited his sisters -- and did n't travel again for more than three years			2
" i was basically afraid to leave the house , " he says			2
" i was full of fear			1
" this unchecked terror arises despite statistics that show how safe flying is			2
less than 1 % of total transportation fatalities in the @entity112 were the result of air accidents in the most recent figures from the @entity116			2
but numbers do n't necessarily calm nerves			1

and she did , with the help of a @entity124 course			0

" they just do n't do it			0
" @entity179 of @entity180 , 39 , was supposed to be maid of honor at her sister 's wedding in @entity185 10 years ago			0
her entire family traveled to the event , including her 80 - year - old grandmother , who had flown over from @entity189			0
@entity179 boarded the flight from @entity180 to @entity185 but did n't make it to takeoff			0
" if i stay on this plane , i am going to die , " she thought			1

" she missed the wedding , and for 10 years , she did n't fly			1
finally , @entity179 took a course with @entity124			0

more treatment available some travelers are afraid to travel by plane without letting that fear interfere with their lives			1
they might grip their armrests tightly during takeoff , say a prayer before they board or take anti-anxiety medication			0

" i really do n't like turbulence , " says @entity220 , editor of the travel blog @entity222			0
but she does n't let that stop her from traveling overseas			0
driving is n't a realistic option when holiday plans include @entity228			0
" i 'm not going to let my fear of flying prevent me from flying			1
" fear of flying " does n't discriminate , " says @entity230 , director of research and clinical services at the @entity233 clinic in @entity234			1

others just anticipate a rocky ride			0
" through treatment , we teach people relaxation skills to better allow them to cope , " @entity230 says			0
his clinic uses virtual reality technology to simulate a flight			0
it also uses data and statistics to teach nervous fliers that thousands of flights take off successfully every day			0
a wide range of treatments are available for people with flying fears			0
so whether a person has n't flown in decades or just gets anxious during turbulent flights , he or she should be able to find the right remedy			0
" over the last 30 years , there have been a lot of treatments that have been developed , and refined , " @entity174 says			0
" thirty years ago , there were no treatments at all			0
" every person 's anxiety takes a different form , so their solutions do , too			0
" no two individuals are treated the same way , " she says			0
with the range of remedies , people with flying phobias have a higher chance of curing their fears			0
" people have a lot of success , " she says			0
" we know that they can get better			0
" conquering a fear of flying comes at a cost : sessions can cost hundreds of dollars , and most patients need more than one			1
but for many , the cost of living with the phobia and missing important personal and professional obligations can be higher than the price of curing it			0
for @entity295 , the thrill of traveling helped him overcome his fear			1
" i almost think travel is a drug , " he says			0
" i love to explore new places			0
