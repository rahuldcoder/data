@entity0 -- a recent college graduate is suing her alma mater for $ 72,000 -- the full cost of her tuition and then some -- because she can not find a job			1
@entity7 has sued her alma mater , @entity8 of @entity0			1
@entity7 , 27 , of the @entity9 , graduated from @entity0 's @entity8 in april with a bachelor of business administration degree in information technology			2
on july 24 , she filed suit against the college in @entity14 , alleging that @entity16 's " @entity15 did not help me with a full - time job placement			1
i am also suing them because of the stress i have been going through			2
" the college responded that it offers job - search support to all its students			1
in her complaint , @entity7 says she seeks $ 70,000 in reimbursement for her tuition and $ 2,000 to compensate for the stress of her three - month job search			1
as @entity7 sees it , any reasonable employer would pounce on an applicant with her academic credentials , which include a 2.7 grade - point average and a solid attendance record			0
but @entity16 's career - services department has put forth insufficient effort to help her secure employment , she claims			2
" they 're supposed to say , ' i got this student , her attendance is good , her @entity38 is all right -- can you interview this person ? ' they 're not doing that , " she said			0
@entity7 said she has fulfilled her end of the job - search bargain , peppering companies listed on @entity16 's e-recruiting site with cover letters , résumés and phone calls			0
but no more than two employers have responded to her outreach , and those leads have borne no fruit			0
her complaint adds , " the office of career advancement information technology counselor did not make sure their @entity16 e-recruiting clients call their graduates that recently finished college for an interview to get a job placement			1
they have not tried hard enough to help me			0
" she suggested that @entity16 's @entity15 shows preferential treatment to students with excellent grades			1
" they favor more toward students that got a 4.0			0
they help them more out with the job placement , " she said			1
ireport.com : " do n't sue your alma mater " @entity8 released a statement saying that " while it is clear that no college , especially in this economy , can guarantee employment , @entity8 remains committed to working with all its students , including ms. @entity7 , who graduated only three months ago , to prepare them for careers and to support them during their job search			1
" @entity7 says she has not hired an attorney to represent her because she can not afford one			0
when she filed her complaint , she also filed a " poor person order , " which exempts her from filing fees associated with the lawsuit			0
asked whether she would advise other college graduates facing job woes to sue their alma maters , @entity7 said yes			2
" it does n't make any sense : they went to school for four years , and then they come out working at @entity99 and @entity100			2
that 's not what they planned			0
" @entity1 's @entity104 contributed to this report .			0
