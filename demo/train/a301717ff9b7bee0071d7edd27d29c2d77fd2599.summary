-- a 12 - year - old girl from @entity2 has called out @entity3 for failing to include female athletes in its 2014 basketball catalog -- and she 's getting plenty of backup on the @entity9			1
@entity11 's letter to the company , which her father later tweeted , drew attention to the lack of gender equality in the ads. " i think that girls should be treated as equally as boys are treated , " she wrote			1
" i , myself , enjoying playing and watching basketball , womens basketball			0
" the self - proclaimed " @entity26 " has been praised on @entity23 for bringing attention to the issue			0
although the basketball catalog does include women , they are portrayed in passive or supportive roles : " sitting in the stands " or " mentioned once in the catalog on page 5 for some shoes " or as " cheerleaders on some coupons , " @entity11 wrote			1
" it 's hard enough for girls to break through in this sport as it is , without you guys excluding us from your catalog , " she added			1
the @entity44 say they may take their business elsewhere unless @entity47 's resolves to include more women in its advertising ; @entity11 even named several of her favorite professional women 's basketball players who would fit the bill in the letter			1
" maybe my dad will take me to some other store that supports girls to actually play basketball and follow their dreams and not sit on the sidelines and watch the game to get my next pair of shoes and equipment , " @entity11 wrote			2

" they said that they liked her letter and that in future publications they will consider putting more women in the catalog , " @entity11 told @entity0			2
