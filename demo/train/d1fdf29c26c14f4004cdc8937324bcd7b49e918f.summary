-- @entity1 , the @entity3 @entity2 laureate who died friday at 74 , will be remembered for his translations , for his literary essays , for his generous international public presence , but principally for the poetry he himself wrote			1
though the @entity1 of the poems could sound unsettled , or even tormented , he was in person equable , welcoming , generous ; these qualities would enter the poetry too			1
and he will be remembered not for one kind of poetry , but for several : he amazed even attentive admirers as he became , over his long career , in one way the opposite of his early self			1
his first great poems were tough , inward , tied to the soil ; his last , just as @entity3 , were confident , sometimes gleeful , creatures of air			0
@entity1 began as a poet of earth			1
raised in a large farming family in @entity27 , @entity28 , educated there and in @entity29 , he applied his gifts at first to the landscape where he felt at home , a place of village survivals , of un-english place names ( " @entity37 , " " @entity38 " ) and eloquent modesty , comparing his poetry to ploughing , to blacksmiths ' work			1
he wrote in " @entity42 " : our unfenced country is bog that keeps crusting between the sights of the sun. ... the ground itself is kind , black butter melting and opening underfoot			2
this kind ground might swallow him up , but it might also provide him with a voice			0
when parts of that ground became violent , @entity1 was there			1
his time in @entity29 as student and teacher encompassed the violent years known as the @entity61 , the years of the @entity62 and the @entity63 , of bombings at funerals and @entity67 troops on the streets ; @entity1 became a poet of burial sites , of guilt and self - division in terse , halting stanzas			1
in " @entity75 " ( 1973 ) and in " @entity74 " ( 1975 ) , he examined the violence directly and by analogy with the @entity79 corpses that @entity81 archaeologists exhumed			0
" the @entity84 , " he wrote , " seems to weep / the black river of himself " ... " with the actual weight / of each hooded victim , / slashed and dumped			2
" those poems made him internationally famous			0
had he written nothing else , or nothing as powerful , afterwards , he would be remembered securely as the careful , anguished , self - accusing poet of a divided land			1
but he went on ; he changed			0
after " @entity74 " he moved south , to pastoral @entity92 , in the @entity93			2
there , with his wife and three children in suburban @entity96 , and at @entity97 , where @entity1 taught for most of the 1980s and 1990s , he would find new and persuasive ways to write about enduring affection , familial and civic , and about how his own spirit could feel more free			1
" @entity105 , " from " @entity106 " ( 1979 ) , embodies nostalgia along with a pastoral joy : " @entity107 ploughed into other : opened ground , ... each verse returning like the plough turned round			0
" ( @entity1 would use " @entity114 " as the title for his 1998 @entity113			1
) resistant to dogma yet drawn to the numinous , @entity1 depicted himself in @entity118 ( 1983 ) walking a traditional route of @entity121 pilgrimage , meeting ghosts from the @entity3 literary past			1
one tells him : " we are earthworms of the earth , and all that / has gone through us is what will be our trace			2
" another -- the ghost of @entity131 -- advises him differently : " the main thing is to write / for the joy of it ... it 's time to swim / out on your own and fill the element / with signatures on your own frequency			0
" and so he did			0
@entity1 became in his later career a great poet of the spirit lifted , a writer identified with fluency and light , with water and air , as well as with his native ground			1
one of the twelve - line poems in @entity151 ( 1991 ) remembers the childhood pleasures of wading : " @entity154 transience			0
/ crumpled flow the sky - dipped willows trailed in			0
" another retells the @entity3 legend of a man who fell out of a magical airborne ship , into a monastery 's scriptorium , then climbed back on board , " out of the marvelous as he had known it			0
" everyday work , even indoor work like writing , could be marvelous too			2
@entity1 recorded these marvels in sheaves of sonnets , in complex old forms such as sestinas , in an iambic pentameter whose confidence buoyed his readers too , even when -- as in his last book , " @entity180 " ( 2006 ) -- he used those soaring lines to remember dead friends			1
he became , if book sales are a measure , perhaps the most popular serious poet writing in @entity186 anywhere in the world			1
and he became determinedly international , writing verse parables derived from @entity190 , adapting tragic drama from ancient @entity192 , and translating " @entity194 " from the @entity193			0
yet he remained connected to the particulars of the @entity3 spaces he knew , to his first friends in poetry ( and in folk music ) , and to his own earlier selves			2
later poems ( such as " @entity202 " ) would see how he had , and how he had not , changed , and would see -- in the 1990s and 2000s -- the political change that brought calm , even peace , to the counties of his birth			0
" @entity226 , " the last poem in " @entity114 , " begins " in @entity228 along the @entity229 " ; but it rises soon enough to a space of permission and imagination , a generous space identified with poetry itself , where " you are neither here nor there , / a hurry through which known and strange things pass / as big soft buffetings come at the car sideways / and catch the heart off guard and blow it open			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity232 .			2

@entity232 : @entity1 , who died friday , wrote poetry , literary essays , translations
his early works were of earth , and of the @entity61 ; he found fame writing about divided land
he says later he went south , wrote of civic , family life , dead friends , embraced the numinous
@entity232 : he became perhaps the most popular serious poet writing in @entity186 anywhere
