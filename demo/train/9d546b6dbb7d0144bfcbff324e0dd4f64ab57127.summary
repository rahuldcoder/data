-- the woman at the center of the @entity4 prostitution scandal embraced her notoriety and spilled colorful details friday about alcohol flowing like water and secret service agents dancing on a bar			1
@entity11 is the escort who unwittingly sparked investigations that have ensnared roughly two dozen members of the @entity4 and @entity17 military over reported use of prostitutes in @entity20 in the days before president @entity21 visited last month			1
she gave a lengthy , wide - ranging interview to @entity20 's @entity23 on friday			2
it attracted international attention , with reporters from as far away as @entity27 calling in to press for more details			2
she retold the story of the disagreement in the hallway of the @entity32 , of her fear after the fallout and what she envisions for herself in the future			2
her days of selling her body are over , she said , but she is open to appearing nude in men 's magazines			1
" my life is already ruined by this , " she said			2
@entity11 said she considers her reputation shattered but is looking for opportunity by voluntarily stepping fully into the limelight that has been chasing her			1
if a magazine offered the " right price , " she would pose nude , she said			2
the fallout of the scandal has " left me cured " of being an escort , she said			2
" that part of my life is dead			0
" in the interview , she also presented a more nuanced view of herself			0
amid her fears that the @entity17 government might retaliate and do her harm , she is also nervous about what her crush thinks about this			0
she does n't have a boyfriend , she said , but " i 'm interested in someone			0
i do n't know how he 's taken all this			2
i wish i could go inside his head			0
" she also said that she would not have told police about the incident if she had known the men were agents , and that their behavior hypothetically could have put the agency 's work at risk			1
she did n't see any schedules or plans regarding @entity21 , she said , but if she had been someone wanting to do harm , " while i was with them , i could have done a thousand things			0
" given such an opportunity , a terrorist could have wreaked havoc , she said			0
concerns about a security breach , as well as outrage over the salacious nature of the scandal , have motivated multiple investigations by the @entity4 , the military , the @entity89 's inspector general and several congressional committees			1
on friday , @entity92 chairman @entity91 , @entity94 - @entity93 , said he had more questions about the agency 's internal review after meeting with @entity4 director @entity98			1
in particular , @entity91 noted the @entity4 said it interviewed 10 of the 12 women involved but had been unable to find the other two , including @entity11			1
citing the radio interview by @entity11 that " details information vital to the investigation , " @entity91 said he asked the @entity4 " for an explanation of how they have failed to find this woman when the news media seems to have no trouble doing so			1
" nine of 12 @entity4 agents implicated in the scandal have resigned or are being forced out , while three others were cleared of serious misconduct			1
a separate military investigation of 12 @entity17 military members is continuing			0
details of what happened on the night @entity11 met the @entity4 agent had surfaced before friday , and she confirmed the narrative in her interview with @entity23			1
a friend at the bar introduced her to a man who was interested in her , @entity11 said			1
she watched as the man and his friends ordered bottles of vodka			0
" they were buying alcohol like it was water , " she said			0
she saw them dance on the bar			0
the man she was with liked to dance in a " disorderly " manner in which " he lifted his shirt to show off his six - pack			0
" they did n't speak the same language , but when the man mentioned " sex , " she answered in her basic @entity139 , " baby , cash money			0
" they agreed on $ 800 , she said , and went to his hotel			1
the next morning , she was awakened by a call from the front desk alerting her that it was time for overnight visitors to leave the hotel , she said			0
she woke the man up , and he refused to pay , telling her " just go , bitch			0
" it was a completely different personality than the night before , when he was very loving , she said			0
" when he was drunk , he was a different person than when he had his wits about him , " @entity11 said			1
the escort walked across the hall to the room of another man , who had brought her friend to the hotel			0
that couple came out and tried to sort things out with the first man , but he refused to open the door			2
now it is known that the two men were secret service agents , though at the time she had no idea			1
the only hint that the man was some sort of official was a uniform inside his room , which led @entity11 to presume that he was in the military			1
sources with knowledge of the investigation have told @entity0 that the @entity4 agent at the center of the scandal is @entity184			1
@entity184 , of @entity185 , @entity186 , has now left the @entity4 , but it was not clear under what circumstances			1
@entity11 says she does not recall what name , if any , @entity191 gave her that night			2
but she would recognize him if their paths crossed again			0
" i remember his face as if i saw him yesterday , " she said			0
@entity11 said she spent hours trying to persuade the agent to open the door and pay her , but she finally gave up around 10 a.m. as she was leaving , however , she came across a local police officer who encouraged her to share what was bothering her			1
more agents wandered into the hallway and pleaded , " please , please , no police , no police , " @entity11 said			1
three agents pooled their resources and gave her $ 250 , she said			2
she took the money and left the hotel			0
it was two days before @entity11 learned what scandal had been ignited that day			1
today , @entity11 says she would have let the man off the hook if she had known he was @entity4			1
but that sentiment is not out of respect			0
" they are idiots , " she said			0
" they were protecting president @entity21 , and they did n't see the magnitude of the problem			0
" @entity0 's @entity220 contributed to this report .			2

new : @entity223 rep. @entity91 has more questions about the @entity4 prostitution scandal
@entity11 says hypothetically , someone could have harmed the agents
she says she is open to posing for men 's magazines in the future
the *argument* was over $ 800
