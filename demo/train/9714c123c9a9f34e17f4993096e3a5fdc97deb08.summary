@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 will hold parliamentary elections monday , with political parties competing for 272 seats in the @entity6			1
election posters jostle for space on a street in @entity10 ahead of @entity1 's elections on monday			1
the elections were due to take place in december of last year but were postponed after the assassination of @entity16 chairman , @entity15			1
in 2008 , 49 political parties applied for poll symbols with the @entity19			1
outlined below are the main contenders : @entity16 the assassination of leader @entity15 looms large over the @entity16 , which had been banking on the charismatic leader to rally supporters to its cause and shake off the charges of corruption that have dogged the party since @entity15 fled prosecution after two terms as prime minister			2
the fortunes of the party , launched in 1967 by her father @entity33 , remains in the hands of her family , with son @entity38 installed as chairman			0
founded on promises of " egalitarian democracy , " the @entity16 flirted with socialist principles in its early days , gaining a mass popularity that continues to ensure it is among @entity1 's largest political parties			1
while the @entity16 has lost touch with its socialist roots , it remains popular among @entity1 's oppressed and underprivileged , particularly in the southern province of @entity49 , from where the @entity36 hails			1
@entity51 the @entity51 is the largest faction of the @entity51 and is led by @entity52 , who has re-emerged as a political player in @entity1 in the past few months after returning from @entity54 where he was exiled after being ousted from power in a 1999 coup led by @entity57			1
the centrist conservative party was in power twice in the 90s , with both terms ending amid damaging allegations of corruption , despite campaigning on an anti-graft platform			0
@entity52 's 1997 victory was the largest mandate every recorded in @entity1 , but was immediately called into question by his opponent @entity15			1
the term ended in chaos as			0
@entity51 under @entity52 received a huge public mandate in 1997 and formed a government with two - thirds majority			0
though his rule was credited with economic growth it was cut short when complaints of corruption and an attempt to replace the head of the military backfired when newly - installed army chief @entity57 led a successful coup , forcing him into exile to avoid corruption convictions			0
permitted by @entity57 to return to @entity1 last year , @entity52 is now banking the @entity51 's fortunes on a platform of renewing the country 's top judiciary -- removed by @entity57 during a state of emergency			1
@entity89 formed under guidance from @entity57 in 2001 , the @entity89 was originally a splinter faction of the @entity51 , which was able to attract enough dissidents from the @entity51 to cobble together an alliance and form a government in 2002			0
the largely center - conservative party has seen its power base dented through its association with @entity57 as polls show the president 's falling popularity in the face of the resurgent @entity16 and @entity51 @entity102 formed after @entity57 allied himself to the @entity104 - led anti-terror coalition in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attack on @entity107 and @entity108 , the @entity102 is a coalition of six @entity110 parties that emerged as a powerful challenger to the president			2
opponents have decried the @entity102 , or @entity115 's goal of establishing a theocracy in @entity1 , and its attempts to impose hardline sharia law in the impoverished areas where it exerts greatest control			1
the resolutely anti-american alliance , dominated by @entity123 ( @entity124 ) and @entity125 ( @entity126 ) saw success in the 2002 elections in the @entity130 and @entity131 provinces and went on to form a provincial government in the @entity130 and a coalition government in @entity131			2
its prospects are likely to be hampered by a dispute within the alliance over whether to boycott the parliamentary elections			1
@entity138 the @entity138 stands for the @entity138 , a party formed to protect the rights of the @entity141 - speaking immigrants from @entity142 after @entity143			0
led by @entity145 from his self - imposed exile in the @entity147 , the party has been supportive of @entity57 's policies and formed part of the @entity89 alliance			0
frequently facing allegations of involvement in terrorist activities , the party 's recent efforts to extend its support base to other provinces have yielded little success			0
@entity159 the @entity159 is a nationalist leftist party based in the @entity130 that and enjoys widespread popularity with ethnic @entity161			0
the @entity159 did not enjoy much success in 2002 but has renewed hopes as the @entity102 's following fades in the @entity165			0
@entity166 @entity167 is headed by the cricketer - turned - politician @entity168			0
@entity172 in his criticism of @entity57 's policies , @entity168 has failed to capitalize on his popularity as a sportsman , seeing his party take just one seat in the 2002 elections			2
@entity166 has said it will boycott the 2008 elections			2
