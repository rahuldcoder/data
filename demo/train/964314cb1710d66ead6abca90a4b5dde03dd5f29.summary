from his sanctuary in the @entity4 embassy in @entity5 , with roughly a dozen police officers outside , @entity1 founder @entity0 said saturday that everyone in the world will be just as effectively monitored soon -- at least digitally			1
" the ability to surveil everyone on the planet is almost there and , arguably , will be there in the next couple of years , " said @entity0 , speaking via @entity9 to a large audience at the @entity12 festival here			1
@entity0 rocketed to international fame , and infamy , in 2010 after @entity1 began helping publish secret government documents online			1
@entity4 granted @entity0 asylum in june 2012 and he fled to the embassy to avoid extradition to @entity25 , where he is wanted for questioning over allegations that he raped one woman and sexually molested another			1
he calls those charges false and politically motivated , but has said he fears @entity25 will transfer him to the @entity29 , where he could face the death penalty for the work of @entity1 if he were charged and convicted of a crime			1
on saturday , he called life in the embassy " like a prison , " adding that actual inmates " arguably " have it worse			1
saturday 's talk was billed as a question - and - answer session , but because of technological glitches it ended up being mostly an hourlong speech by @entity0 , punctuated occasionally with questions from @entity43			1
the one - sided conversation seemed to turn off some members of the 2,000 people in the audience , many of whom streamed out before @entity0 was finished speaking			1
with little to guide him other than his own thoughts ( moderator @entity51 's audio connection appeared to go down after about 15 minutes ) , @entity0 was largely left to expound upon his views that world powers like the @entity29 and @entity55 have overstepped their bounds in terms of online surveillance			2
he said the @entity59 has become a " rogue agency " with too much power , even suggesting that president @entity60 would be toppled politically if he attempted to disband the agency			2
" they would come up with all of this dirt ( on @entity60 ) , " he said			0
" @entity66 may impeach him ... a criminal act would come to light			0
" @entity0 described activist groups like @entity1 as freedom fighters in an age when governments have occupied what should be their citizens ' private online space			1
" now that the @entity78 has merged with human society , the laws of human society should apply to the @entity78 , " he said			0
he said that because governments keep so much information secret , citizens do n't have a complete picture of what is happening " we 're all actually living in a world that we do n't understand , " he said			0
@entity0 called it a " fictitious representation of the world , " an illusion in which " the true nature of government power structures is obscured			1
" we 're walking around constantly in this fog			0
" he also had harsh word for private internet titans such as @entity97 and @entity98 , who have come under scrutiny in recent years for collecting data about their users			0
" what is going on is an unprecedented theft of wealth from the majority of the population by those who already have a lot of power , " said @entity0 when asked a question about @entity97 and privacy			2
" they 're doing that in part by stealing information from all of us			0
knowledge is power , and so they 're accumulating a lot of power			0
" he had similar complaints about @entity98 , noting that there are now 1 billion @entity125 devices in the world			0
" that 's a big problem , that a single group is able to capture that much information ( about people )			0
you are all the product			0
" @entity0 's talk was one of several high - profile events at this tech - themed conference dedicated to online privacy and transparency			2
on monday , @entity59 leaker @entity138 is scheduled to address an @entity12 crowd via a live feed from his exile in @entity142 .			2
