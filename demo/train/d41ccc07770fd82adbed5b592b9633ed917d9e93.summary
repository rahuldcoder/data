@entity0 -- the only thing more horrifying than the murder of a @entity5 soldier in a @entity0 street is the fear that there is little police can do in the age of " open - source jihad " to prevent these types of terror attacks			1
" it 's always the one we feared , the lone wolf that can come from nowhere and not be on our radar , " said @entity15 police chief @entity14			1
on wednesday two men hacked the soldier to death near his military barracks in @entity23 , southeast @entity0 before delivering a message to a witness 's camera : " we swear by almighty @entity27 we will never stop fighting you until you leave us alone ... this @entity5 soldier is an @entity29 , a tooth for tooth			1
" @entity32 : @entity0 murder victim named the message has all the hallmarks of classic @entity37 rhetoric , and experts believe the blood - soaked men wielding cleavers for the cameras in @entity0 are just the latest proponents of the " open - source jihad " that seems to have grown just as the @entity47 - led " @entity46 " scattered the organization 's terror cells around the world			1
" nearly a decade ago there was a debate within @entity37 about the future of the organization , " according to @entity52 , @entity53 at the @entity54 for the @entity55			1
" @entity57 had been overrun by @entity47 forces , the @entity56 had been forced to retreat , and as a result @entity37 lost its ability to train recruits there			1
" the organization needed a new plan to stay relevant as the @entity47 struck at the heart of its traditional operation in places like @entity57 , @entity68 and @entity69			2
enter a man called @entity71 , the so - called architect of the new @entity37 , who had a simple plan to change the way @entity37 took the fight to the @entity75			1
" every muslim should be an army of one , " @entity52 told @entity1			1
" that was his grand idea -- every individual muslim should be an autonomous hub that goes out and strikes the @entity75 and you ca n't contain it			2
" @entity81 may have had the vision , but it was @entity84 ( @entity84 ) that translated it into reality in 2010 through the online speeches of radical cleric @entity88 -- since killed by a @entity47 drone strike -- and the publishing of " @entity91 , " the @entity92 that acts as a how - to guide for followers to carry out small - scale terrorist attacks in the @entity75			2
" since 2010 @entity37 has been telling its followers in the @entity75 : ' do n't try and do another 9/11 or 7/7 - style attack because invariably these things catch the attention of security services and you go to jail			1
think small , think easy , think unsophisticated			0
really scale it down to make it difficult to detect , because really it 's a detection battle , ' " @entity52 said			0
" what they 're demonstrating is you can do something very easy -- go buy a knife , go stab somebody , it 's impossible to stop			0
provided you pick a sensitive target , you can still cause absolute pandemonium			0
" so this is the growing struggle facing police forces around the world today , say experts -- not more traditional terror cells , which are more likely to show up through traditional surveillance methods , but self - starters who become radicalized through online sermons and publications			1

@entity131 pleaded not guilty to terrorism charges and is awaiting trial			2
the pressure cooker bombs that killed three people near the finish line of april 's @entity137 bore strong similarities to a design laid out in the first issue of the magazine titled " how to build a bomb in @entity142 , " according to @entity1 's @entity143			0
in 2010 @entity5 mp @entity144 was nearly killed when a 21 - year - old @entity5 student stabbed him during a meeting with his constituents in east @entity0			1
the student , @entity148 , told police she had become radicalized after watching the speeches of @entity88 online , and tried to kill @entity144 because he voted in favor of the @entity152			0
@entity14 , who was @entity153 assistant commissioner until he retired in 2011 , told @entity1 : " as someone who has tried to prevent these attacks in the past , they 're the most difficult ones			0
" if we have some serious targets , then of course you can apply the correct level of resources and tactics ... ( but ) @entity148 had never come to the attention of any authorities at any point			0
" opinion : real enemy in @entity0 hacking death so what , if anything , can be done to prevent lone wolf attacks ? the grisly murder in @entity23 has prompted calls for @entity5 's government to look again at a shelved bill that would greatly expand law enforcement 's powers to monitor suspects ' use of the internet , which is currently only possible on a more limited basis			1
" there is some internet surveillance going on , " said @entity14			0
" it 's been made very clear by police chiefs in recent weeks that if you download something like ' @entity91 ' you will be arrested , it is an offence and you will be charged			2
" so where to draw the line between free speech and invasion of privacy ? the proposal to expand police powers for collecting online data caused uproar among privacy advocates in late 2012 , but the government says more robust surveillance tools are now needed to effectively combat terrorism			2
while acknowledging there are " powerful " arguments on both sides , @entity14 said : " all i know is that you 've got to do something , because the level of sophistication in technology is going to make it extraordinarily challenging to improve the way that the internet and other means of communication are monitored if nothing 's done			0
" read more : @entity5 @entity216 condemn @entity0 slaying but radicalization expert @entity52 said monitoring the internet and tracking down anyone who downloads an @entity88 speech or a bomb - making guide wo n't solve the lone wolf problem			1
" you do n't have to have read ' @entity91 ' anymore -- everyone knows what 's going on because , if nothing else , the media talks about it so much			0
the idea of committing an unsophisticated attack against a high - profile symbol is out there			0
it 's an impossible thing to work against , " he said			0
@entity14 says in order to prevent future attacks , counter-terrorism police must bolster their community engagement strategy -- making local people feel " free and able to provide relevant information at the right time			0
" " it comes back to the line from the 1980s with the @entity245 : ' communities defeat terrorism			2
' that was the strap - line then , and it 's no different today			0
