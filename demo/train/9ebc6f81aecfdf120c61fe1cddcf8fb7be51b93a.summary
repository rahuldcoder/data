-- the cassette tape is back ! or at least this is what the organizers of @entity4 , held in september , would have us believe			1
cassettes ? really ? let 's play along , if only for nostalgia 's sake			1
fifty years after the prototype cassette was introduced at the 1963 @entity12 , a group of independent labels that release new cassettes have pulled together the global event celebrating and , they hope , stimulating the resurgence of prerecorded tapes			1
the day was observed , according to the group 's website , at roughly 100 retail stores and music venues in the @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 , with tie - ins , new cassette releases and live performers pushing new tapes			1
cassette releases from established bands like @entity32 and @entity33 were vended , as well as tapes from underground artists like @entity36 and @entity37 on the @entity38 for the @entity40 label			1
anyone who remembers fumbling with a cassette deck while driving or listening as a tape unspooled and self - destructed in the tape deck or having to insert index finger or pen into the cassette in a usually vain attempt to rewind the hopelessly twisted tape must be asking a simple question : why ? in the seamless age of digital music , when seemingly every song ever recorded is available at the stroke of a few computer keys , why would anyone revive such a clunky and outmoded physical format ? but consider : even with the convenience and sheer abundance of music stored on mp3 files , cassettes ( and vinyl ) offer tangible and tactile pleasures that are n't readily available in the digital world			1
there 's a sizable , and growing , subset of consumers who lust for musical objects that they can hold in their hands ( and their hearts ) as well as their ears			2
" metal and punk and noise people never stopped releasing cassettes , " says @entity75			0
he is a music critic and owner of @entity82 in @entity83 , @entity84			0
" fans of that music have always collected tapes			2
same with jam band and @entity90 fans until recent years			0
it 's still a common format for a lot of @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity96 street or folk music too , because cassettes are so cheap to reproduce			2
cassettes have always been an alternative and were for many years something of an underdog in the musical format wars			0
not long after prerecorded cassettes emerged in the vinyl - dominated marketplace , the 8 - track tape format eclipsed them in popularity			1
that was largely because the @entity111 started offering 8 - track players as an option on some of its cars beginning in 1966			1
the automobile would power sales of the 8 - track format past the cassette in the music - mad ' 60s and ' 70s			1
drivers could insert and remove the bulky 8 - tracks with one hand			1
by 1975 , incredibly , 8 - track tapes were second only to vinyl records in terms of sales figures			1
cassettes had already been a tough sell to audiophiles because until the advent of @entity133 noise reduction in the ' 70s , their sound quality was muffled compared with vinyl records			1
gradually that improved , just as new tape playback options emerged			2
even before the @entity138 , the portable stereos known as boom boxes boosted the popularity of cassettes in the urban areas where these hulking radio / tape players ( aka ghetto blasters ) were most often used			0
boom boxes made music consumption a public event ( often whether the public wanted it or not ) while advancing the notion of portability			2
but consumers began to demand portable music players			0
in late 1979 , @entity151 introduced the proto - walkman			2
retailing for $ 199 , the @entity138 was a 14 - ounce playback - only device that came with headphones and used standard - size cassettes			0
by 1981 , the smaller and cheaper @entity157 was available			0
hello , 80s ? we miss you ! when it comes to recorded music formats , portable equals personal			0
so it 's no accident that the @entity138 and similar devices became known as personal stereos in the early ' 80s			0
soon , @entity138 headphones were as ubiquitous as boom boxes on city streets			0
thanks to the @entity138 , the boom box and the cassette ( and later the cd ) , sales of vinyl records plummeted during the ' 80s			1
in 1981 , more than twice as many vinyl records as prerecorded cassettes were sold			1
by 1984 , the numbers had flipped , and cassette sales outpaced vinyl for the first time			1
despite the unsuccessful " @entity187 " campaign of the early ' 80s , the ability to record one 's own tapes was always a huge part of the cassette 's appeal			1
homemade mix tapes became a cultural touchstone for a generation ( or two ) , functioning as diaries or journals and figuring in courtship rituals ( see @entity198 's affecting memoir " @entity199 " )			1
when cassettes faded from the scene in the early ' 90s in the conquering wake of the cd , something unique -- personal -- got left behind			0
gone , perhaps , but not forgotten			0
the pull of nostalgia is not the only motivation behind the recent cassette cult resurgence , but memories and recorded music are deeply -- some say neurologically -- intertwined			2
" there is that @entity213 aspect , " @entity75 says			0
" it 's an exclusivity thing			0
cassettes just seem like a cooler thing to have for sale at your punk or noise show than a cdr			0
black metal and power electronics sound fab on tape , though			0
same with @entity226 bass music			0
i still listen to a lot of metal and rap on tape , and i make mix tapes from vinyl that sound amazing			2
" even if @entity4 fails to bring prerecorded cassettes back to commercial prominence , the event made a telling point about our music consumption			2
despite the digital revolution , if you dust off those outmoded physical formats like cassette tapes and vinyl records down in the basement , they produce more than memories : they play music			1
their appeal , however sentimental , is stronger than mere nostalgia			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity255 .			2

@entity255 : september brought @entity4 . why celebrate this ? let 's play along
organizers wanted to stimulate a resurgence of cassette tapes , first sold in the ' 60s , he says
he says cassette tapes warred with vinyl and 8 - track tapes for dominance , sometimes winning
@entity255 : their quality improved , though they fell from favor . but still a cultural touchstone
