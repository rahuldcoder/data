@entity0 -- it 's a familiar refrain from the media - shy @entity4 @entity3 : judge us by what we write in our rulings , not in oral arguments , speeches or interviews			1
but the court term that ended this week in dramatic fashion reveals how difficult it can be to create a coherent picture of this dynamic bench , one that moves easily , if stealthily , across ideological lines on a range of hot - button cases			1
this body , led by a relatively youthful 58 - year - old chief justice , is one that is thinking long - term : conservative and cautious			1
the drama that played out over three days looked like a ping - pong match : on monday the court allowed affirmative action to continue in college admissions , while making it tougher in the future for public institutions to promote diversity in the classroom			1
two liberal justices agreed with the five conservatives			0
@entity3 sidesteps big ruling on @entity38 affirmative action tuesday , it was back to a familiar 5 - 4 , conservative - liberal split when the majority struck down the heart of the @entity43 , leaving the federal government without its major enforcement tool to fight discrimination against minority voters			1
court strikes down part of historic voting rights law and the finale wednesday , giving gay rights supporters a major political and social boost by striking down part of a federal law that did not recognize same - sex marriage in states where it was legal and essentially clearing the way for homosexuals to wed in @entity62			1
same - sex marriage rulings hailed as historic victory one case was split along ideological lines , with moderate - conservative justice @entity67 the " swing , " or deciding , vote ; the other produced an unusual coalition in the 5 - 4 divide			1
missing was an overarching " equal protection " right allowing gays and lesbians to marry in all states			0
the court is nowhere near that legal destination			2
so anyone in the political branches hoping for reliability from the current court , especially on social issues , may be disappointed			2
" this is a conservative court -- conservative ideologically and conservative in the sense that they like to take baby steps , " said @entity86 , publisher of the well - respected @entity87			1
" there are times when the court decides to act aggressively over time , for example limiting the use of race in government decision - making like affirmative action			1
then there are other times when the court is more uncertain and wants to move more modestly			0
in the same - sex marriage cases it does n't want to force the entire country in one direction or another			0
" by the numbers it may surprise some , but the nine justices , despite their ideological differences , do like each other personally			0
and they readily find room for agreement			0
half the 78 decisions from argued cases this his term were unanimous , 9 - 0			2
but 30 % were split 5 - 4 , including voting rights , the two same - sex marriage cases , dna testing for arrested criminal suspects , government electronic surveillance , and @entity127 adoptions			0
that is a higher percentage than in past years , according to @entity87 , which annually compiles the numbers			0
ten of the 23 cases decided by one vote had the familiar five conservatives prevailing : chief justice @entity134 and justices @entity135 , @entity67 , @entity137 , and @entity138			1
but six times @entity67 sided with his more progressive colleagues : justices @entity141 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145			2
in probably a first for this court : @entity137 -- perhaps the most right - leaning -- was the decisive vote when he joined the four liberals in a criminal sentencing appeal			2
@entity135 , too , was a friend of the left on several other criminal procedure cases			0
cockeyed coalitions seem almost routine			0
but the figures overall show what court watchers have long known : @entity134 , and especially @entity67 , played the greatest behind - the - scenes roles			1
@entity67 was in the majority 91 % of the time this term , and in the majority 87 % of the time in the 5 - 4 cases			1
that includes the three blockbusters this week , a display of the power he wields			2
@entity67 often high court 's swing vote and power broker @entity67 , who turns 77 next month , separately offered a broad embrace of gay rights , but a limited endorsement of federal authority in voting rights			1
colleagues on the losing sides of the biggest cases spared no rhetoric slamming @entity67 's personal views of the court 's " primary role in determining the constitutionality of a law " as he wrote in the @entity183 case , overriding the will of @entity185			1
in supporting @entity183 , @entity135 said @entity67 was promoting " judicial supremacy " over the other branches of government			2
in supporting the @entity43 and the power of @entity185 to oversee states with a history of minority discrimination , @entity141 noted the " sad irony " when she said , " hubris is a fit word for today 's demolition of the @entity43			2
... where is the court 's usual restraint ? " even lawmakers have learned to accept the you - ca n't - win - them - all reality of the court 's jurisprudence			1
" as disappointed as i was yesterday , i am happy today , " @entity207 minority whip @entity206 , @entity208 , said when the same - sex marriage decisions were announced			0
@entity134 rules if @entity67 is on the winning side more than any of his bench mates , the chief justice is not too far behind			1
@entity134 ' key role crafting the opinion striking down part of the @entity43 came after years of careful , incremental strategizing to limit the effect of racial classifications			2
in 2006 , with just months on the job , @entity134 lamented , " it is a sordid business , this divvying us up by race			2
" a year later discussing a case that struck down a voluntary school integration plan , he said firmly , " the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race			0
" then in 2009 , @entity134 and the conservatives on the court sent a clear message to @entity185 : fix the @entity43 and its federal enforcement scheme or the court would have " no choice " but to act as the constitutional arbiter			1
when lawmakers did not respond , the court in large measure did as it promised this week , in stunning fashion			1
president @entity241 said he was " deeply disappointed " in the decision , quite a shift from a year ago when @entity134 led the court in upholding the @entity245 , the president 's signature health care reform effort			1
back then the president called that decision " a victory for people all over this country			0
" while @entity67 dominates the 5 - 4 decisions , @entity134 was in the majority only 61 % of the time			1
but many conservative legal scholars say the chief justice has a years - long view of the law and of his own power			1
that gives them hope for the future , even when they do not prevail today			0
" it 's disappointing to see the representatives of the people in @entity185 having been overruled here , " said @entity263 , chief counsel at the @entity264 , about the @entity183 ruling			2
" but i think the silver lining is that we see , as the chief justice pointed out , that actually this is a somewhat narrow decision in terms of leaving it to the states to be worked out there in the future			1
" what worries many progressive activists is the conservative court 's consistently united voice on business - related cases , which typically dominate the docket			1
these disputes do n't generate the same political pulse as race and marriage , but carry a hefty legal consequence			0
" as opposed to issues like the dismantling of affirmative action , where the court 's conservative bloc is divided and has trouble agreeing about how far and how fast to take the law , the court 's conservatives are completely united " on this front , said @entity290 , head of the @entity291			1
" @entity308 wins ; workers , consumers , mom and pop shops , and other individual @entity4 asserting their rights in federal court lose			0
" the excitement of this term will spill over when the justices resume their work in october			0
among the closely watched petitions : another affirmative action dispute and a @entity316 voter referendum that bans racial preferences in public university admissions , state employment and government contracting			0
public prayers in town council meetings			0
the validity of @entity241 's recess appointments to a federal agency when the @entity326 was in a " pro forma " session			1
each member of the court at some point in their tenure begins to think about a personal legacy			0
some of the ( relatively ) younger ones may think long - term ; the elder justices may realize they only have a few more years to make their mark			2
three of the justices are in their 50s , three are in their 60s or early 70s ; three are 75 or older			0
that and the shaky ideological makeup create a court with subtly different agendas and demands			0
the tension over the 5 - 4 cases , the mixed - result efforts by @entity134 to forge consensus , and the fact each of the chambers operates essentially as their own independent judicial shop means fixing a unified adjective on these nine justices is impossible			1
several of the justices privately acknowledge this unique relationship among themselves			0
as one told @entity1 a few years ago , " if we can agree , we will			0
if we ca n't , we do n't			0
that 's how we look at it , and that really is how it has been , at least as long as i have been on the court			2
and i expect it will continue			0

@entity3 term ends this week in dramatic fashion with rulings on three hot - button topics
chief justice @entity134 and justice @entity67 are power players on the court
expert : the court is conservative ideologically and in that " they like to take baby steps "
next term the court will consider the validity of some of president @entity241 's recess appointments
