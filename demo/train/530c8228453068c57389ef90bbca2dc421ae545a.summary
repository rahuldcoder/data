@entity2 is charged with 30 federal counts stemming from the april 15 attack , when a pair of bombs went off near the finish line of the packed course			1
three people died in the blasts , including an 8 - year - old boy , while a @entity16 police officer was killed three days later at the start of the dramatic chase that led to @entity2 's capture			1
@entity16 police lined up outside the courthouse as the hearing neared its end wednesday afternoon in a show of solidarity with their fallen comrade , @entity26			2
inside , about 30 survivors of the attack watched as @entity2 appeared before @entity31 magistrate judge @entity30			1
it was the first time he had been seen in public since his arrest			2
the 19 - year - old was dressed in an orange jail jumpsuit , his hair long and shaggy , his left arm in a cast			1
he was wounded in the pursuit -- during which his brother , @entity43 , was killed -- and he appeared to have an injury to the left side of his face			1
@entity2 looked back at the spectators in the packed courtroom before entering his plea -- and to @entity51 , whose two sons each had a leg amputated after the attacks , he appeared to smirk			1
" he did have some family members in the courtroom , so i do n't know , " @entity51 told @entity55			2
" but to me it was , like , no remorse whatsoever			1
" suspect : @entity60 attack was payback for hits on @entity63 @entity51 said her sons " really do n't want to hear about it , " but she said she had to be in court for them			1

@entity2 was found in a motorboat dry - docked in the backyard of a @entity90 , @entity89 , home , covered in blood from bullet wounds sustained during a manhunt that brought @entity60 to a standstill			1
victims and their families tend to appear in person at trials at two key moments , said @entity55 legal analyst @entity100 : at the arraignment and at the verdict and sentencing			1
" it 's not something they want to watch on television			2
they want to be there , " he said			2
the death penalty @entity60 mayor @entity112 is confident about getting a conviction , he told the @entity114 on tuesday			0

" but that wo n't be enough for many victims and their families			2
and prosecutors will likely go for the death penalty			0
seventeen of the charges offer that possibility			0
last bombing victim leaves hospital @entity100 said @entity2 's lawyers could argue that he was under the " mesmerizing influence " of @entity43 , his older brother			1
but @entity100 believes one piece of evidence will make it easy for prosecutors to shoot down that argument : while he lay bleeding in the motorboat , covered with a tarp , the younger @entity2 apparently scrawled his motive for his alleged deeds onto its sides			1
" the @entity31 government is killing our innocent civilians , " it read			0
" i ca n't stand to see such evil unpunished			0
" " we @entity63 are one body , you hurt one you hurt us all			0
" " now i do n't like killing innocent people it is forbidden in @entity149 but due to said ( unintelligible ) it is allowed			0
" timeline : the bombing , manhunt and investigation " stop killing our innocent people and we will stop			0
" " that would indicate that he was not under his brother 's influence , that he had an independent thought process and dedication to this movement on his own , " @entity100 said			0
prosecutors will use the writings to argue intent -- that @entity2 knew what he was doing			1
indictment blow by blow @entity2 is charged with killing three spectators in the bombings and a @entity16 police officer ambushed in his cruiser a few days later			1
he also is accused of " maiming , burning and wounding scores of others , " @entity31 attorney @entity173 has said			0
