-- world leaders are moving carefully and anxiously , trying to prevent a disaster in the @entity3			0
this increasingly unpredictable round of saber - rattling is far from over , but so far the winner is the @entity8 regime and the losers are the brutally oppressed @entity8 people , joined by much of the rest of the world			1
while we watch the drama from far away , it 's worth noting just how far @entity8 weapons programs -- not just the weapons themselves -- can reach			1
@entity20 intelligence officials differ on their estimates of the range and accuracy of @entity8 missiles , nuclear - tipped or not			2
but the country 's nuclear and missile technology has already found its way to the @entity29			1
@entity8 helped @entity30 develop a nuclear reactor			2
it has sold missile technology and weapons to anyone willing to pay , and it has developed close cooperation with @entity37			0
if the crisis ended right now -- with every piece of military hardware back to where it stood a few months ago and everyone taking a vow of silence on the matter so that we get no more threats and no more demands -- the confrontation would have already sent clear and damaging messages across the globe , encouraging tyrants and regimes seeking or considering the idea of developing nuclear weapons			1
opinion : @entity8 endgame - 3 scenarios @entity8 's message seems to be : if you have nuclear capabilities , it does n't matter how outrageously you behave ; it does n't matter how horribly you mistreat your people ; it does n't matter how flimsy your economy is			1
when you have a nuclear arsenal , countries that could topple your regime with a tiny fraction of their power suddenly become afraid of making you angry			1
this is a pernicious reality with tragic and hazardous consequences			0
nuclear development makes it easier for the totalitarian regime to condemn the @entity8 people to grinding poverty and imprisonment in nightmarish gulags			1
several generations of the same family can live and die in captivity			0
while the @entity8 people go hungry , the regime diverts scarce resources to its nuclear and missile programs while its top leader , the youthful @entity88 , adds insult to injury with his visibly expanding girth			1
as the latest crisis unfolded and as @entity8 threatened a " preemptive nuclear attack " on the @entity20 , a " final destruction " of @entity96 , and a " nuclear attack " on @entity98 , world powers held a new round of talks with the @entity37 regime over its nuclear program			1
coincidence or not , the talks with @entity37 produced nothing , not even the customary agreement to hold more talks			0
@entity37 , one can only imagine , must be paying close attention to the dance macabre between @entity109 and the rest of the world			2
@entity8 , whose entire economy is worth about $ 40 billion -- less than a small - sized @entity20 city and a tiny fraction of prosperous @entity96 and its trillion - dollar economy -- has ordered the whole world to attention			2
experts are scratching their heads , trying to figure out what exactly @entity88 wants and how far he will go			0
there 's general consensus that he wants , like all dictators , to strengthen his hold on power and to secure the support of the military			0
but he is accomplishing more than that			0
@entity8 is giving its crucial weapons industry a huge boost of publicity			2
every headline is a @entity135 - size ad for the country 's destructive wares			0
opinion : why i fled @entity8 current and future clients may have noticed that its arsenal has allowed @entity8 to get away with creating these crises , which fortify the regime and sometimes even bring generous international aid			1
without its dangerous arsenal , it 's unlikely @entity109 would have gotten away with the 2010 shelling of @entity151 island , when it killed two @entity96 marines and three civilians , sent the population fleeing in panic and set homes and forests on fire			1
despite @entity96 's vow of " enormous retaliation , " the regime is still in place			0
not only is it still standing , it is spreading its deadly know - how			0
@entity8 has long been one of the world 's top proliferators of missiles and other weapons systems			1
@entity20 officials say @entity37 recently received @entity8 missiles capable of reaching @entity173 capitals			0
last september , @entity174 and @entity109 signed a scientific cooperation agreement , which experts say is almost identical to the one @entity8 signed with @entity30 a decade ago			1
that agreement with @entity178 brought @entity8 technicians to help the @entity30 dictator @entity180 build a nuclear reactor that @entity183 warplanes destroyed in 2007			2
and the @entity8 , incidentally , is still sending weapons to @entity178			2
back home , when @entity8 carried out its third nuclear test earlier this year , news reports in the region said @entity37 scientists were there to observe			2
this standoff is not over , but @entity109 has already won			1
from the moment the @entity8 obtained nuclear weapons , however rudimentary , the game changed			1
from that moment , the chances that the @entity8 people will rejoin the world and have a chance at a better life diminished greatly			0
from that moment , the @entity96 and the @entity200 's room to maneuver became much more limited			0
the challenge now is to prevent a greater disaster , while keeping the regime from scoring an even greater victory , as it has in the past , by walking away from this confrontation with new rewards			0
beyond that , the world must seek a creative way to help free the @entity8 people , while bearing in mind the disastrous consequences of allowing dangerous regimes to obtain nuclear weapons			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity216 .			0

@entity218 : @entity8 weapons programs have spread to the @entity29
@entity221 : @entity8 's messages encourage tyrants to seek nuclear weapons
she says with nuclear arsenal , powerful countries are afraid to make a regime angry
