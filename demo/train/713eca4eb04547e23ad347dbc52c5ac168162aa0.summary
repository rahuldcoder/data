-- as rooms go , it 's quite nice			2
it 's shaped like an egg			2
it has a well - tended garden a few feet out the door , and then an expanse of lawn leading to a fence			2
it is certainly not the most ornate or luxurious room in the @entity13			2
most five - star hotels have suites that out - glitter it			2
any number of corporate ceos boast offices that are larger and more lavishly outfitted			0
but the @entity20 at @entity21 in @entity22 has always been the object of a singular kind of yearning			1
@entity26 fervently wants to move into it in january ; @entity28 just as fervently wants not to move out			0
this fall 's presidential campaign , which begins in earnest with the @entity32 this week , will determine whether it will be @entity26 or @entity28 who gets his wish			0
@entity0 poll : which candidate cares more about you ? campaigns go by so quickly , and unfold so feverishly , that the combatants can be excused for not dwelling on the fact that each successive occupant of the @entity20 is , by definition , a transient			1
it 's temporary work , the presidency , and the @entity20 is the traditional home of the most high - level temps in the world			1
i 've been looking at two pieces of @entity20 video , each mesmerizing , even astonishing , in its own way			1
neither was originally intended for public consumption			0
each stars a man who is in his final weeks -- or in one case final hours -- as president			0
one of the men knows it			0
the other has no idea			0
the first video consists of outtakes from an interview that @entity65 and @entity66 of @entity67 conducted with president @entity68 on september 9 , 1963			1
@entity65 and @entity66 were at the apex of their fame and journalistic influence ; their evening newscast , " the @entity75 , " was expanding from 15 to 30 minutes , and @entity68 had agreed to tape the @entity20 interview to launch the longer show			1
the main interview had concluded			0
but on the tape , @entity68 tells @entity65 and @entity66 that he is dissatisfied with some of the answers he gave them			1
he wants to do them over			0
" there 's one or two places we 're a little ragged , " he says to the newsmen			0
and then , to be certain @entity65 and @entity66 understand what he is asking for : " let 's try and do it again and we 'll see what comes out this time			1
" they accede ; they redo the questions			0
and what comes across most strongly in the footage is the complete aura of command that @entity68 projects in that @entity21 office			1
he appears filled with the @entity20 's inherent power and authority , and betrays not a smidgen of doubt that , for him , all of that will likely go on			1
neither @entity68 , nor @entity65 and @entity66 , could have had any inkling that within 12 weeks he would be dead in @entity111 , that the two newsmen would be covering his funeral , and that @entity114 , not he , would be sitting in this office			1
in the outtakes , @entity68 gives @entity117 advice on whether a new @entity120 - @entity119 movie is worth seeing ; @entity68 seems supremely at home and at ease in that room			1
leaving it looks to be the furthest thing from his mind			0
the other piece of videotape features a president who knows that , within 24 hours , he will be leaving the @entity20 , and the presidency , ahead of schedule			1
most of us have seen @entity135 's resignation speech from the evening of august 8 , 1974			1
but , in the five minutes before he addressed the nation , there was some calibrating of lights and checking of sound levels			0
@entity135 was in the chair behind his desk for that			1
and it was all being recorded			0
through the amalgam of overwhelming emotions that had to have been coursing through him -- he knew what he would be saying to the citizens of the @entity13 a few minutes later -- @entity135 grins			1
it is as if he does not want the technicians to see his anguish to an assistant who , for purposes of lighting adjustments , is sitting in the president 's chair behind the @entity20 desk as @entity135 enters the room , @entity135 says : " hey , you 're better lookin ' than i am			1
why do n't you stay here ? " to the person operating the television camera : " have you got an extra camera in case the lights go out ? " it 's banter , in a dark @entity13 hour			0
he sit behind his desk and says : " all @entity173 , are there any @entity173 in the room ? out			0
" he gets no response , and because the camera is focused on @entity135 we do n't see the @entity173 agents			2
but it is clear that they do not depart , because @entity135 says in their direction : " you do n't have to stay , do you ? " then : " you 're required to ? " finally : " i 'm just kidding you			2
" it is a difficult video to watch , because the moments are so raw			0
in its own way , it is even more revelatory than the resignation speech itself			0
here is a man who worked all his life to make it to this room , and now he -- as @entity68 , in a very different context , did before him -- is leaving it earlier than he thought he would have to			1
@entity68 and @entity135 may be the stars of those videos , but the real star is the room itself -- it is the one aspect of the videos that is sustaining and permanent			1
@entity26 and @entity28 will battle all fall for the symbolic key to that room , even while knowing that , in the end , it will stop being theirs			0
presidents depart ; the @entity20 remains			2
which may be at the heart of the lure that has made so many people over the centuries hunger to be there , for however brief or long a stay			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity223 .			2

@entity223 : @entity20 for some the most coveted room in the nation ; however transient
he says two *fraught* videos convey how ephemeral a president 's time in the @entity20 is
one shows outtakes of interview with supremely *confident* @entity68 just *months* before he died
other shows @entity135 bantering *awkwardly* before resigning , ceding his yearned - for position
