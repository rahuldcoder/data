@entity0 -- actress @entity4 's wrongful termination lawsuit against the studio that produces " @entity6 " will be retried in september , a @entity0 judge ordered this week			1
the first trial ended without a verdict as jurors deadlocked 8 to 4 in favor of the actress after three days of deliberations			1
they needed nine jurors to agree on a verdict			0
the judge set aside 12 days on her calendar for the jury trial , which is scheduled to begin on september 10			2
in her lawsuit , @entity4 claimed her character was killed -- and her acting job eliminated -- in retaliation for her complaining that show producer @entity21 hit her during a rehearsal for the @entity24 comedy - drama			1
@entity4 lawyer @entity25 has previously said he did not expect an out - of - court settlement			2
" my view is that @entity28 is the unhappiest place on @entity30 , so why would there ever be a settlement offer ? " @entity25 said			0
@entity24 lawyer @entity33 said the retrial will be " far more narrow than the previous case " since the judge tossed out @entity4 's battery complaint against @entity21 , leaving only the wrongful termination issue against the @entity24			1
lawyers for @entity21 and @entity24 's @entity40 argued the demise of @entity4 's character was a creative decision unrelated to the workplace complaint			1
@entity24 executives testified that @entity21 gained their permission to have @entity47 -- the sassy blonde played by @entity4 -- die in may 2008 , four months before the incident in which @entity21 allegedly struck @entity4			1
the hit during a rehearsal was just " a light tap on the head " intended to demonstrate " a piece of physical humor " that @entity21 wanted @entity4 to perform , the defense said in opening statements			2
@entity4 testified that @entity21 hit her because he was frustrated during a discussion over her lines in a scene			2
" it was a nice wallop to my head , " she said			0
one juror who voted for @entity4 's case said afterward that the defense story " just did n't hold water for me			2
" @entity66 , a retired elementary school principal , said her decision to find the studio liable was based on her doubts about the credibility of several defense witnesses , which included high - level @entity24 executives			1
" there were a lot of people that some of the jurors found not too credible , " @entity66 said			0
juror @entity79 , who also voted for @entity4 's side , said it seemed to him that @entity24 executives scripted their stories " just a little bit			1
" " i do n't say they was scripted , " @entity84 said			0
" it 's more like the story do n't match for me			0
" although the show 's line producer reported the hitting incident to the studio 's human resources department , there was no investigation until an @entity24 senior executive saw a @entity97 story about it at a grocery store two months later , according to testimony			1
what followed was a " fake " investigation designed " to protect the money machine known as ' @entity6 , ' " @entity25 said			0
" nobody wants the ' @entity6 ' applecart turned upside down			0
" the human resources investigator did not interview @entity21 or @entity4 , only three people who worked for @entity21 , @entity25 said			0
five months and 11 episodes after the rehearsal incident , @entity21 informed @entity4 that @entity47 would die during a show taping the next day , ending her five - year run on " @entity6			2
" " to my estimation , it was n't handled correctly , " juror @entity66 said			0
" it was n't handled the way it should have been handled			0
" @entity4 was asking for $ 5.7 million in damages from @entity24 and @entity21 , although the actress was paid $ 4 million in her last year of work and is still earning royalties from her vested interest in the hit series .			1
