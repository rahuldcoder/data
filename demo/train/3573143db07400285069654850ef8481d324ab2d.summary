@entity0 -- in his retirement announcement , @entity2 sen. @entity2 cited " the dearth of meaningful action from @entity8 " as one reason for not seeking re-election next year			1
" the debt - ceiling debacle of 2011 and the recent fiscal - cliff vote showed @entity8 at its worst and , sadly , i do n't see the legislative gridlock and partisan posturing improving anytime soon , " the @entity10 veteran said in a statement			1
@entity17 sen. @entity16 can appreciate @entity19 ' sentiments			1
when was asked earlier this month about the functionality of @entity8 , he chalked up the body 's poor legislative record to a few problems			1
the most important one , he said , was the fact that members do n't know one another outside of work			2
" in two years [ since he came to @entity0 ] , we have not had , in the @entity31 , a bipartisan caucus , where @entity17 and @entity33 talked about the problems of the day to try and find commonality , " he lamented			2
" it is very sad			2
and i know many times i would look up on tv and i would see somebody and then the name would come up and it would say ' member of @entity8 ' and i 'd go ' i do n't even know who that is , ' " said former @entity37 rep. @entity37 , who lost his re-election bid in november			1
it is a common refrain on @entity48 -- the idea that if @entity8 were more social , more buddy - buddy outside the @entity10 complex , that it would be more functional in doing the people 's work			1
the good old days the truth is not that simple , according to former leaders of the @entity31 and @entity56			2
the nostalgia for the " good ol ' days , " when members would play tennis atop the @entity62 and drink whiskey after hours , may be tempting to admire , but it is far from the cure - all for @entity0 's seemingly unbreakable gridlock , they say			1
" @entity71 is always great , " @entity66 , a former @entity17 representative from @entity67 and senior fellow at the @entity69 , said with a laugh			2
" sometimes i remember my life as congressman in the ' 80s positively and my wife says i am dreaming			2
' you hated it , ' she will say , " he said			2
@entity66 was in @entity8 from 1977 to 1995 then was president @entity78 's agriculture secretary until 2001			1
he said he watched @entity8 change in the late 1990s and 2000s and wondered about the tipping point			1
his synopsis : @entity8 is like other organizations , except it has 535 independent contractors rather than a business - like structure built around a chain of command			1
" @entity8 is no different than any other organization , if people do n't get along , then you get dysfunction , " @entity66 said			1
" basic principles of just human interaction are if you do n't like each other and you distrust each other , that is a recipe for an unproductive life			2
" if numbers are any judge , the 112th @entity8 was markedly unproductive			1
the 220 laws enacted were the least in four decades			1
one fifth dealt with naming or renaming post offices and federal buildings			2
by comparison , the 100th @entity8 enacted 713 laws			1
@entity0 an electoral death trap being more sociable " is not the cure - all , " @entity66 said			1
other former members of @entity8 and high - level aides say the good old days may have been nicer , sociability wo n't lead to bipartisanship			1
" i think it is broader and bigger than that , " said former senate majority leader @entity110			2
" i do n't want too much revisionist history			2
everybody said that was the golden era [ in the early 90s ]			2
it was not always easy , though			2
we had some pretty tough disagreements			0
" @entity110 points to the welfare debate between @entity78 and house speaker @entity120 and impeachment proceedings against the president in the late 90s as examples			0
for men like @entity66 and @entity110 , the problems of @entity8 are deeper than whether they dine , drink and hang out with each other			1
the fact that @entity128 is only a five - hour flight from @entity0 means that members can easily get into town on a monday and head out by thursday night , leaving no time to socialize			0
" when i first came to @entity0 , members had six roundtrip air tickets paid for , " @entity110 said			0
" now it is unlimited , you can use whatever part of your budget on airfare			0
" " @entity8 is becoming a commuter @entity8 , " said former @entity17 sen. @entity139 from @entity140			1
living in @entity0 also has become an electoral death trap			0
" if members are going to be social with each other , it is going to have to be in @entity0 , " said @entity142 , deputy editor of the @entity143			1
" members are spending the least amount of time in @entity0 as possible because they do n't want the baggage of being seen as ' too @entity0			0
' " funds are raised from the extremes , not in the middle , said @entity153 , a former @entity56 member from @entity154 who did not seek re-election in 2010			0
until there are well - funded outside groups funding centrist candidates , he said , the polarization of the @entity56 and @entity31 will get worse			0
" you [ a member of @entity8 ] follow the money and you follow the activists and of course those folks , whether you are a @entity166 or a @entity33 , keep you out of the middle because the middle is the valley of death politically , " @entity153 said			1
@entity172 anyone ? @entity110 believes president @entity173 is a big part of the problem			1
" he does n't really invite @entity17 over there very often , let alone @entity33 , " he said			0
the truism that @entity173 is n't social enough with @entity8 was a common refrain during his first four years in office and that wo n't change , if history is any judge			1
when asked about it , the president generally laughs it off , references his kids and moves on			0
he did exactly that on january 15 when a reporter asked him whether he and the @entity56 staff " are too insular			0
" " obviously , i can always do a better job , " @entity173 said			1
" and the nice thing is that now that my girls are getting older , they do n't want to spend that much time with me anyway , so i 'll be probably calling around , looking for somebody to play cards with me or something , because i 'm getting kind of lonely in this big house			0
" some democrats , like @entity199 , a former spokesman for @entity31 majority leader @entity200 , say the idea that more would get done if @entity173 were more of a schmoozer is wrong			1
" anyone who thinks that by virtue of the president inviting @entity208 [ @entity207 ] @entity206 down to the @entity56 to watch a movie is going to help improve things needs to get their head examined , " @entity199 said			0
" that is not the way it works			0
" but if you ask @entity10 watchers like @entity142 , the distance between @entity173 and @entity8 is an issue			1
@entity17 want a fuller embrace from their leader in the @entity56 , while @entity33 feel they are n't getting the level of respect they deserve			0
for that to happen , says @entity142 , there has to be something in it for both sides			0
" what is the incentive for them [ the president and @entity33 ] to foster these relationships , " @entity142 said			0
" their time is valuable , just to be friends for the sake of being friends , i do n't know that they have time			0
it is good in theory , but until they see the fruits of that time investment			0
" for @entity110 , the fruits of investing in collegiality are obvious -- lifelong friendships			0
@entity110 said he still considers @entity166 and former senate majority leader @entity247 a good friend , and that he has spent weekends away with former sen. @entity249 of @entity250 and sen. @entity251 of @entity252 , both @entity33 , and their wives			0
@entity110 's most enduring relationship from @entity8 seems to be with @entity255 , a @entity166 who switched parties in the @entity56 and then became a @entity33 senator from @entity258			1
@entity110 and his wife , @entity259 , are close with @entity255 and his wife , @entity260			0
last year they traveled to @entity262 and @entity263 on a personal trip together and the foursome plans to go to @entity266 in june			0
" friends are for life , " @entity110 said about @entity255			0
" especially if they are real friends			0

a common refrain is the notion that a more sociable @entity8 would be more effective
the 112th @entity8 enacted the fewest laws in four decades
@entity8 used to be more sociable , but there were issues then , too
some *observers* believe @entity173 's lack of social engagement is a problem
