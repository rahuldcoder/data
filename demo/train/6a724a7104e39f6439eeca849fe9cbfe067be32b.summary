-- more than a week after a video showing what appears to be a @entity5 man beating a migrant worker was posted on the @entity7 , a government official questioned its authenticity			1
" there is no proof this is real yet , " said maj. gen. @entity9 , a spokesman for the @entity10 , in a telephone interview on tuesday			1
" the police are still investigating and trying to verify the video clip			2
" the video , which was posted october 27 to @entity17 , had received more than 127,000 views by tuesday			2
in a telephone interview with @entity0 , @entity9 called on anyone with knowledge of the video to contact authorities			2
" nobody has actually reported this incident to the police yet , " he said			0
" and nobody has come to police claiming to be a victim of the abuse			2
" in addition , he said , no evidence has emerged to indicate that the incident occurred in @entity5 or involved a @entity5			2
" just because it may seem to be a @entity5 man in the clip does n't mean that it actually is a @entity5 , " he said			1
in the one - minute and 53 - second video , a man wearing an orange jumpsuit , his right eye swollen , appears seated on the floor of a room as another man -- dressed in white -- yells at him , initially striking him in the head with his open hand			1
a shaky video shot by someone out of camera view documents the incident			0
government officials told @entity0 last week they believed the aggressor was a @entity5 man who was angry because he thought the man in orange -- perhaps a worker -- had spoken to his wife			1
" why did you come here when she was here ? " he asks in what sounds like @entity5 - accented @entity59			1
" i swear i did n't mean it , " pleads the man , whose clothes and accent appear to be those of a migrant laborer , adding , " i swear to @entity67 i did n't know			2
" as the questioning continues , the man in white -- slapping his victim -- demands to know why he would dare contact his wife			0
the slapping then grows in ferocity to include kicks and blows to the head and body with what appears to be a leather strap or belt			0
" sit down ! kneel down ! " yells the man as the flogging continues			0
he then asks the victim if he wants to die			0
" no ! " the man screams			0
officials said they did not know where the incident took place , but were investigating			0
women who defied @entity5 driving ban fear repercussions the @entity5 government - backed @entity93 has condemned the incident			1
" we are taking this very seriously and are looking into it with @entity5 security , " said the commission 's @entity96			1
" we are doing our utmost to ensure the accused abuser is arrested and tried			0
we are also doing everything we can to find the abused man , so that we can help him in any way			0
" another @entity5 government - backed human rights group , the @entity106 , is also investigating			1
" we do n't know where it took place , but it is under investigation and we 'll release details in a few days ' time , " said @entity108 , president of the society , last week			0
the incident is not unique			0
global human rights groups have documented widespread abuse of migrant workers in @entity5			1
according to @entity122 , more than 9 million migrants work in @entity5 , making up more than half the work force			2
" many suffer multiple abuses and labor exploitation , sometimes amounting to slavery - like conditions , " the rights group said in july			2
" the kafala , or sponsorship , system ties migrant workers ' residency permits to ' sponsoring ' employers , whose written consent is required for workers to change employers or leave the country , " the rights group said			1
" employers often abuse this power in violation of @entity5 law to confiscate passports , withhold wages and force migrants to work against their will or on exploitative terms			1
" @entity122 @entity5 researcher @entity149 said that " @entity5 needs to get serious about protecting migrant workers by providing adequate avenues to justice and mechanisms of redress			1
" @entity5 preacher sentenced to 8 years , 600 lashes for killing 5 - year - old daughter migrant laborers elsewhere in the @entity159 face similar problems			1
" nobody can come into the @entity165 states or in the @entity159 without a sponsor , " says @entity161 , with the @entity162			0
migrant workers are routinely asked to surrender their passports , which can leave them vulnerable to abuse , he said			1
" when the employer has that kind of power , then they can dictate the working conditions , " @entity161 said			0
" whether it 's a question of the wage rates , whether it 's a question of the work time			0
" rights activists say the problem is getting worse .			0
