@entity0 -- when gunmen riddled bullets through @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 and an alphabet soup of cities and towns across the country , the nation sent up collective wails of grief at the death of the innocents			1
@entity16 swore this time was different			2
lawmakers vowed they 'd take a stand			0
but political seasons are fickle			0
so are the @entity16 people			2
background checks on gun sales : how do they work ? in december , days after the @entity5 , @entity26 , school shooting spree that left 20 children and seven adults dead , more than half of the nation favored stricter gun control laws , according to national polls			1
less than six months later , that number dwindled to just over 40 %			1
several national polls show that roughly 90 % of @entity16 support some form of universal background checks			1
however , that provision has faced intense pushback from some lawmakers and is a major sticking point even as @entity42 leader @entity41 scheduled a vote thursday to block the filibuster on comprehensive gun control reform			1
@entity1 poll : background checks popular , worrisome instead , those negotiators may be on the verge of putting forth a watered - down version of background checks in order to salvage the broader gun control package wending through that chamber			1
though @entity57 background checks are required for commercial sales , the proposal being considered would expand them to gun shows and internet sales , but they would not require checks for other private transactions , according to multiple sources familiar with the talks			1
is this how democracy works ? " if our democracy 's working the way it 's supposed to and 90 % of the @entity16 people agree on something , in the wake of a tragedy , you 'd think this would not be a heavy lift , " an exasperated president @entity67 said in @entity68 , @entity26 , on monday			1
but the gun control debate — with its at times befuddling plot twists — highlights what many are loathe to admit : this is the way democracy works			1
or at least this is the way democracy has worked with such similarly controversial measures as the @entity88 and the bank bailouts — both of which were pushed through despite public opposition			0
public opinion does n't always equate to a legislative outcome			0
yes , the gun control advocates are buoyed by the outrage of a grieving nation and a presidential administration 's powerful push			1
but the gun - rights advocates are backed by the powerful gun lobby and a motivated and vocal interest group -- the @entity102			2
add to that the public 's confusion about current gun laws , said @entity107 , co-director of the @entity109 , and it 's a recipe for gridlock			2
@entity111 grows for compromise proposal on gun control " it 's the usual stuff , " @entity107 said			1
" historically politicians have feared even the smaller group of pro-gun folks more than the pro-gun violence prevention movement			0
" that 's because the gun advocates are motivated by that single issue and are far more likely than their more liberal - leaning gun control counterparts to be outspoken on that particular issue , policy experts said			1
" what happens is that the gun owners , the gun enthusiasts are one - issue voters , and there 's been research done that shows that if you ask gun owners if they oppose gun control and you ask how vehement they are , they say ' it matters , ' " said @entity125 , dean and professor at the @entity127 at @entity129 's @entity128			1
" then you ask ' what have you done in opposing gun control			1
' they say ' i donated money			0
i wrote to my congressman			0
i 've called my senator			0
' " those who support stricter gun controls are motivated by a broader mix of issues			1
" when you ask the gun control people the same thing they 're like ' what do you mean			2
' they have a bunch of things that matter , " @entity125 said			0
@entity102 ' plucks the bird ' to weaken gun proposals gun rights voters are aided by the targeted efforts of the @entity102 , which has more than 4.3 million members			2
the powerful gun lobby and its allies in @entity167 use a sophisticated campaign -- constantly shifting the focus of the battle among various provisions , raising new arguments to old issues and proposing solutions that would expand weapons use and training instead of increasing regulation			2
the @entity102 also exerts its political clout through a rating system that identifies friends and foes of its positions in @entity167 and directs substantial contributions to political campaigns it favors or opponents of candidates it dislikes			0
from gun hater to @entity102 - loving mom senate minority leader @entity192 , @entity193 , who received an a-rating by the @entity102 , has joined roughly a dozen similarly high - scoring @entity195 in threatening to block @entity197 - backed gun control legislation			2
@entity198 -- the group co-chaired by wealthy @entity200 mayor @entity199 battling the @entity102 in the recent gun control debate -- is using its opponent 's tactics against them , creating their own grading system for lawmakers , some of them facing re-election next year			2
" at the end of the day , these guys represent their states , not the country , " said @entity209 , a senior editor at the @entity210			0
" they need to be in step with their constituents			0
" outmatched sometimes , even when those constituents vocally advocate for stricter gun control laws , they find themselves outmatched			1
@entity221 , executive director of the @entity222 , a group which targets non-college , minority youth and encourages them to vote , said he remembers the @entity102 showing up at a community meeting with the families of gun violence victims in the predominantly black and urban north side of @entity230			2
" it was on @entity232 and they showed up two - to - one			0
they showed up with the slick talking			0
we knew they were going to come deep , but we thought we were going to out organize them , " @entity221 said			0
ultimately , the measure @entity221 's group was pushing — a proposal to require background checks of all gun purchases — failed to even get out of committee in the @entity245 statehouse			1
should anyone be allowed to buy guns ? share your views " we were making a common sense argument that black men are being targeted , " @entity221 said			0
" it was pretty disheartening			0
i 've got ta walk the streets and talk to the mothers , and they still have open wounds			0
" looking at the polls , the ones that president @entity67 pointed to as proof of the country 's broad support for his agenda on gun control , does n't tell the full story either			1
" in every @entity267 poll since the @entity5 massacre , nationally and in six states , we find overwhelming support , including among gun owners , for universal background checks , " said @entity266 , assistant director of the @entity267			1
" @entity16 voters agree with the @entity102 , however , that these background checks could lead someday to confiscation of legally owned guns			1
" by a 48 % -38 % margin , voters in a @entity267 survey said that the government could use the information from universal background checks to confiscate legally owned guns			1
and gun owners believe 53 % -34 % that the checks could lead to confiscation of legal guns			2
there 's also a partisan divide on the question , with 61 % of @entity195 , 51 % of independents and 32 % of @entity292 expecting confiscations			0
opinion : why the @entity102 fights background checks the battleground of the states as blue states like @entity300 , @entity301 and @entity200 take on tougher restrictions on gun purchases and expand background checks , red states are considering pre-emptive laws to nullify a possible federal assault weapons ban			1
the types of gun control measures that easily sailed through the state legislature in @entity301 faced huge hurdles , sparked protests and even drew in such national players as vice president @entity313 and gun manufacturer @entity314 in @entity300			1
even as @entity300 gov. @entity317 was signing into law stricter gun control measures , the @entity316 was giving away " a @entity322 defender @entity320 , courtesy of our friends at @entity325 in @entity326 " and several " gen - @entity327 " on its @entity330 page			1
" it 's a promotional giveaway , " said @entity331 , executive director of @entity316			0
" it looked like there was a chance of banning semiautomatic assault rifles , so it was an in your face ' ok then we 'll give them away then , ' " the group says it plans on giving away more guns and ammo between now and when the new laws take effect on july 1			0
they also are focusing on federal lawmakers they feel might cave to efforts to pass stricter gun control laws			1
" there are a number of weak - willed republicans in the @entity355 , and we do n't want them to feel they have wind in their sails , " @entity266 said			0
" we 're going to make @entity195 pay the price			0
we are going to hold them accountable for their votes			0
nothing is going to be done in secret			0
the days of smoke - filled rooms where even the institutional gun lobbies cut deals is over			2
" @entity1 's @entity369 , @entity370 and @entity371 contributed to this report .			0

days after @entity5 , more than half of the nation favored stricter gun control laws
less than six months later , that number dwindled to just over 40 %
national polls show 90 % of @entity16 support some form of universal background checks
