@entity0 -- the ongoing radioactivity releases from damaged nuclear reactors in @entity4 after last week 's historic earthquake are creating " one of the most challenging humanitarian operations ever conducted , " according to @entity6			1
@entity9 , a spokesman for the @entity11 's @entity10 in @entity4			1
@entity9 said tuesday that for the second time , @entity13 helicopter crews have been exposed to elevated , albeit low , levels of radiation during flights near @entity4 's nuclear reactors			1
in addition , the @entity11 is moving three incoming ships to a new location because of " radiological and navigation hazards " at their intended destination on the eastern coast of @entity26 , according to @entity9			2
just as in an incident on sunday , the crew members were stripped of contaminated clothing , scrubbed down with soap and water and tested			2
in all cases , they no longer tested positive for radiation exposure			2
on sunday , tests detected low levels of radioactivity on 17 @entity11 helicopter crew members when they returned to the @entity39 after conducting disaster relief missions in @entity4 , the military said monday			1
no further contamination was detected after the crew members washed with soap and water , the @entity11 said			1
nevertheless , the @entity13 @entity10 has temporarily repositioned its ships and planes away from the damaged multi-unit @entity47 nuclear plant			0
the @entity11 , however , noted that the most radiation that ship personnel could have received was less than they would receive in a month of exposure to natural radiation sources , such as the rocks , soil and sun. " this will continue to happen , " @entity9 said			1
he did not know how many personnel tested positive for radiological contamination in the second incident nor what ships they were on			2
most of the nine @entity11 warships now operating off @entity4 are involved in helicopter operations			1
for example , the @entity64 flew 29 sorties on tuesday and delivered 17 tons of supplies , including food , water and blankets			0
the @entity71 is transporting 300 @entity73 personnel and 90 vehicles			0
officials expect that air crew members will continue to be exposed to increased low levels of radiation , so the @entity11 is telling helicopter crews to keep their sleeves rolled down and keep cabin windows closed when possible			1
and some air crew members , @entity9 said , have been given potassium iodide pills			0
the iodide protects a person 's thyroid gland from the effects of radioactivity and can reduce the threat of thyroid cancer			0
@entity11 spokesman capt. @entity91 said the iodide pills were given as a " precautionary measure only			2
" the @entity95 's @entity94 , about 25 miles outside @entity96 , is also taking steps in light of the potential radiation threat			0
according to messages posted on @entity95 - @entity4 's official @entity103 page , health officials have been taking " environmental radiation readings every 3 hrs " since monday			1
" all readings taken to date have indicated absolutely no health risk to our community , " the message read			0
nonetheless , the message noted that readings showed " negligible levels " that require the implementation of " mitigating measures , " including limiting outdoor activities , leaving windows closed and keeping children inside for playtime and school recess			0
the radiation exposure appears limited to @entity11 personnel			2
representatives for the @entity124 and @entity125 said they have not seen reports of anyone in their services testing positive for exposure			0
the @entity11 has three ships with the 31st @entity131 on their way to @entity4			1
they are expected to arrive on march 17			0
out of concern about radiation , those ships , the @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 , will now position in the @entity140 on the west coast of @entity26 , rather than the east coast , to aid in disaster relief .			0

second incident occurs where helicopter crew tests positive for low - level radiation
