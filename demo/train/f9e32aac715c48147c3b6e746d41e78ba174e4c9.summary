@entity0 -- interior secretary @entity2 , who led the response to the 2010 @entity5 oil spill and administered a moratorium on offshore drilling , announced wednesday that he is stepping down			1
the former @entity9 lawmaker plans to return home in march after eight turbulent and busy years in @entity0 , four years in the @entity11 and four years as head of the @entity13			2
president @entity14 nominated him for the @entity16 post four years ago and he was unanimously confirmed			0
he was most prominent when he spearheaded the administration reaction to the @entity5 deepwater horizon drilling rig explosion and oil spill in the @entity20			1
@entity2 issued a six - month drilling moratorium after the april 20 , 2010 , explosion			1
critics , including @entity25 leaders , @entity20 state officials and @entity28 residents , slammed the ban			2
they said it would hurt oil and gas workers in the already hard - hit coastal communities , where hundreds of jobs were lost because of the disaster			0
but @entity2 said the moratorium provided time to make sure that similar accidents would n't occur and that rig operators were prepared to deal with worst - case scenarios if they did happen again			2
eleven people died in the explosion , which spawned one of the worst environmental disasters in @entity45 history			2
an estimated 4.9 million barrels of oil gushed into the @entity20 before the broken well some 4,000 feet below the surface was capped			0
" we have undertaken the most aggressive oil and gas safety and reform agenda in @entity45 history , raising the bar on offshore drilling safety , practices and technology and ensuring that energy development is done in the right way and in the right places , " @entity2 said in an @entity13 news release announcing his departure			1
the department has offered millions of acres of offshore acreage in the @entity20 for exploration and " is proceeding with cautious exploration of @entity67 resources , " the release said			0
it added that the department has leased millions of acres onshore for oil and gas development and has protected " special landscapes for hunting and fishing			0
" " today , drilling activity in the @entity20 is surpassing levels seen before the spill , and our nation is on a promising path to energy independence , " said @entity2 , who also overhauled @entity13 's management of oil and gas resources and installed new ethics standards for employees			1
@entity14 's @entity16 : who 's in , who 's out ? @entity2 also has pursued renewable energy , with his department authorizing 34 solar , wind and geothermal projects on public lands since 2009 , the news release said			1
those projects total enough energy to power more than 3 million homes			0
" today , the largest solar energy projects in the world are under construction on @entity45 's public lands in the @entity101 , and we 've issued the first leases for offshore wind in the @entity105 , " @entity2 said in the release			1
" i am proud of the renewable energy revolution that we have launched			1
the release also noted progress made during @entity2 's term regarding @entity110 lands			1
a settlement was reached and passed that addressed " long - standing injustices " involving the government 's trust management			0
in addition , @entity14 signed into law water rights settlements that " help deliver clean drinking water " to tribes , the release said , and spearheaded a reform of surface leasing regulations for @entity110 lands			0
" president @entity14 has made it a priority to empower our nation 's first @entity124 by helping to build stronger , safer and more prosperous tribal communities , " @entity2 said			2
@entity14 , in a separate release , said @entity2 " helped usher in a new era of conservation for our nation 's land , water , and wildlife " and promoted renewable energy along with oil and gas production			1
he " played an integral role in my administration 's successful efforts to expand responsible development of our nation 's domestic energy resources " and made strides in ties with @entity124			1
" i have valued @entity2 's friendship since we both entered the @entity11 in 2005 , and i look forward to receiving his counsel even after he returns to his home state of @entity9 , " the president said			1
@entity2 's move comes amid criticism over @entity14 's second - term @entity16 nominees			2
he has taken flak because major nominations have gone to white males			0
white males have been tapped for three prominent @entity16 positions with second - term openings : secretary of state , secretary of defense and secretary of the treasury			0
one of those posts has been held by a woman , secretary of state @entity166 , while the others have been held by white men			0
@entity2 focused on energizing hispanics while @entity14 's record of appointing women to top posts does n't differ significantly from that of former president @entity175 , many take the issue with @entity14 's appointments since he ran as a champion of women 's issues during both of his presidential election campaigns , unlike his predecessor			2
