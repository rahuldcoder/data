-- in a special report for @entity0 's eye on @entity5 week , @entity2 correspondent @entity1 travels across the vast country from the northern port of @entity8 in the @entity9 to the southern city of @entity11 on the @entity12			1
here chance recalls some highlights from his epic journey			2
@entity1 undergoes cosmonaut training at @entity17			1
@entity18 @entity8 -- what an incredible , surprising place to begin a journey			2
at latitudes where most other @entity9 states maintain little more than a few isolated scientific outposts , @entity5 has an entire city of 300,000			1
in fact , @entity8 is one of the friendlier , more pleasant cities i have ever visited in this country			2
the northern air is rich to breathe ; the strange @entity9 light lends a magical glow to the landscape			0
and there 's a cafe culture ! we sipped cappuccinos in the @entity37 and made friends with locals who seemed genuinely pleased to be living in their frigid metropolis			0
you might think @entity8 is just a freezing monument to the @entity44 's grim determination to settle citizens across its sprawling territory at any cost			2
but today it 's as much a symbol of modern @entity5 's @entity9 ambitions : a strong foothold in a region believed to possess vast natural resources			1
in the global race for control of the @entity9 , @entity8 is giving @entity5 a crucial head start			1
@entity57 @entity58 -- for a day and a half , we trundled through the tundra on board the @entity63 to @entity58 --- plenty of time to watch the white blankets of snow that covered the land gradually disappear			0
but we had come to @entity5 's city of beauty to meet its beast			2
@entity72 stands an incredible 7 feet tall , is a heavyweight boxing champion of the world and a @entity5 sporting hero			1
he used to be known to @entity77 boxing promoters as " @entity72 " -- but he did n't care much for the name			0
now he prefers " @entity72 " which was absolutely fine with me			0
in fact , @entity72 is disarmingly pleasant and soft - spoken			0
he told me he had to work hard on being extra nice simply to stop people from being frightened when meeting him			0
now he concentrates on encouraging @entity5 's youth to take up boxing			2
the country , he says , is a potential hotbed of future champions			0
@entity72 has found fame outside the ring too , starring in several @entity5 movies and writing a book			1
@entity17 @entity2 -- if you 've got $ 30 million to spend , you might want to consider training to be a space tourist in @entity5 's @entity17			1
this is the country 's biggest cosmonaut training center and the next stop on our journey			1
between 2010 and 2015 --- when @entity103 's space shuttle ends its missions , and until the new generation of @entity77 craft come online -- @entity5 will be the only country to have manned missions into space , including to the @entity109			1
@entity103 is now sending all its astronauts here to train in the @entity111 , the vehicle on which they will depend to carry them through their missions			0
and the training is vigorous			0
i know because someone , somehow , convinced me to sample it ! ever been strapped in a centrifuge and subjected to the same g - force as a cosmonaut taking off in a @entity111 ? i have , and i did n't like it .			0
