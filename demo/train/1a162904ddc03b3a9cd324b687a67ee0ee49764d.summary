-- for some , a @entity2 bar is the delicious chocolate - caramel candy with a cookie crunch			1
but for @entity5 , a @entity2 cost him his job and , he says , his house and girlfriend			1
on october 22 , @entity5 , a veteran , was working his shift as a forklift operator at @entity13 ' plant in @entity14 , @entity15			1
it was a temp job that he had secured thanks , in part , to a government program that gives companies tax credits for hiring veterans			0
@entity5 , 27 , toured @entity23 and @entity24 as part of the @entity26			1
" it was about halfway into my shift and i had a few extra minutes			0
i was going to the restroom and the vending machine was next to it , " @entity5 told @entity0 by phone from his brother 's home in @entity32 , @entity15			1
" i was going to grab a candy bar and then go to the restroom			0
" @entity5 said thursday he was riding his forklift and as he approached the restroom he noticed the vending machine was a few feet from the wall			1
" i thought it was a safety hazard , " he said			0
" i do n't know why i decided i wanted a candy bar , but i did			0
so i put in a dollar and it spun like it was going to give out the candy bar , but it did n't			0
it got hung up on the spiral thing that ejects the candy bar			0
" what happened next is a matter of debate between @entity5 , @entity13 and a judge			1
according to a legal decision filed by an administrative judge with @entity56 , @entity5 was involved in " misconduct			1
" the document , the result of an unemployment claim appeal filed by @entity5 , contains a statement from a @entity13 representative saying that @entity5 " was observed by a supervisor lifting a candy machine about one to two feet off the ground with a forklift and then dropping the machine to the ground , which he repeated fix or six times			1
" " when confronted , " it reads , " he had gotten about three candy bars out of the machine , and he claimed he had only shaken the machine to get out the candy bars that he had paid for that had not dropped on their own			1
as a result of this conduct , the employer discharged the claimant			0
" though he was fired in october , and the judge denied his unemployment claim in december , the @entity83 covered @entity5 's story wednesday , pushing it into national headlines			1
@entity5 told @entity0 his version of what happened after the @entity2 got stuck			1
" i tried shaking it by hand , but it did n't do anything			0
then i tried putting in another dollar and nothing happened			0
i could see the candy bar dangling and i was already having a rough day			0
my girlfriend was nine months ' pregnant and it was rough , " recalled @entity5			2
" i shook the machine and the candy bar dropped so i was happy about that			2
but then i was upset that i had spent two dollars on a 90 - cent candy bar , " he said			0
" then i took it upon myself to move the machine back with the forklift			2
" at this point , @entity5 said , a supervisor showed up and assumed the worst			1
" it may have looked like i was stealing candy bars , but the machine stole money from me , " he said			2
the next day , according to @entity5 , he met with human resources and his supervisors to discuss the incident and a day later he was suspended , pending an investigation			2
" i was fired two days after my daughter ... was born , " he said			0
after he was fired , the financial stress proved too much for @entity5			1
his relationship with the mother of his daughter ended and , unable to make rent payments , @entity5 moved out of his house and in with his brother			2
@entity5 filed for unemployment , which @entity13 denied			1
" at that point i realized no one was going to hear my part of the story , " said @entity5 , who filed an appeal with @entity56 , including a 17 - page letter detailing his side of the story			2
but , as bad luck would have it , @entity5 says he never got the notice for his hearing , so he skipped it			2
only after his benefits were denied in appeal did he realize he had missed his chance to set the record straight			0
" i had to take a job at @entity142 making about half of what i was making at @entity13			0
i 'm making just under $ 9 an hour and before i was making about $ 16 an hour , " @entity5 said			0
" this issue was blown way out of proportion			1
