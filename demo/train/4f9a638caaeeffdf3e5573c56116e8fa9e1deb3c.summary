-- apparently , cats do rule and dogs drool			1
what other conclusion could any human being with a heart draw from the video in which a little cat bravely and boldly saves a boy being attacked by a dog ? sure , dog people will try to argue otherwise			1
they 'll point to pugs and sheepdogs and @entity13 and other examples of cuddly , loyal , nonviolent pups			0
but when 's the last time you heard of a kid being viciously mauled by a tabby ? i 'm not saying all dogs are evil			1
but cats certainly do n't get the credit they deserve			0
think popular culture , the heroic dogs immortalized in our stories			0
should we count @entity35 ? anyway , can you think of a single famous fake cat hero besides @entity38 ? and in real life , dogs get plenty of good press			1
@entity43 and all of that			0
cats are denigrated , treated as less than , relegated to old women and semi-ironic decorations on sweatshirts			0
or nasty and creepy , like mr. @entity50			2
or the @entity52 cats in " @entity53 " -- you know , the movie with the heroic dog couple			2
or stupid , like @entity57			0
" @entity59 " is a compliment			0
" cat lady " is not			0
how refreshing to see not just another cat - in - a - cardboard - box video ( though i love them , too ) but a cat doing something , being brave , saving the day			2
@entity66 , the little cat in this video , is n't just a hero to that one child			1
@entity66 is a hero to cats and cat lovers everywhere , tired of being upstaged by the bigger , brawnier , droolier pets who ca n't even manage to use a litter box			1
let 's hope @entity66 inspires a generation of cat heroes around the globe -- as well as the rest of us , including those in children 's literature and @entity84 -- so we no longer see cats just as lazy , fat @entity87 - style layabouts , but ferocious , fierce daredevils			1
@entity66 , the movie , is coming to a theater near you soon			2
cats love nothing more than to bask in the sun , literally			0
maybe now it 's time for cats to have their metaphorical moment in the sun as well			1

everybody has seen video of cat bravely and boldly saving a boy being attacked by a dog
@entity107 : dogs get press for *integrity* , but when 's the last time a tabby mauled a kid ?
@entity107 : @entity66 proves not all cats are lazy , fat *garfields* or mean and creepy mr. @entity116
