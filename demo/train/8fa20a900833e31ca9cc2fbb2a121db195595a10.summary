-- five , maybe 10 minutes was all it took			2
shortly before midnight monday , three inmates at the @entity3 , @entity4 , jail -- two of them accused killers -- slipped into a shower stall , through a shifted ceiling tile and eventually outside to the rural @entity10 region of southeast @entity4			1
" there are some things that you have to scratch your head about in the ( jail 's ) design and construction , " @entity3 sheriff @entity11 said			1
" and there 's also the ( fact there ) are two people watching 95 inmates			0
" the men -- @entity25 , jailed on numerous assault charges , as well as accused killers @entity27 and @entity29 -- remained at large until tuesday afternoon			2
around 3:30 p.m. ( 4:30 p.m. et ) , they were found hiding in a vehicle in a salvage yard about five miles east of @entity33 , said trooper @entity34 of the @entity35			1
@entity36 later showed all three men being taken out of police cars and led back into the jail			2
" it 's been a very long night and a very long day , " @entity11 told reporters after the men 's capture			0
the part of the shower stall where the men escaped was out of sight of cameras , as well as the two guards , according to the sheriff			1
he noted that there was n't any noise to indicate anything was awry			0
the inmates crawled up through about a 10 - inch by 10 - inch hole above the ductwork , before eventually making their way outside -- an escape made easier because the walls " did n't extend completely up to the concrete ceiling , " @entity11 said			1
" they were in and out in what we feel like was a relatively short amount of time , " he said			0
numerous law enforcement agencies -- from as far away as @entity68 , @entity69 , as well as helicopters from the @entity35 -- assisted in the search for the three men			0
the inmates traveled together alongside a flat , exposed and elevated railroad track , @entity11 said , pointing to an analysis of their tracks and preliminary interviews with the men			0
they were wearing bright orange jumpsuits			0
the fact they were so visible , especially in broad daylight and in an area where many citizens own guns , appeared to weigh on the three men 's minds , @entity11 said			0
" ' if i 'd have been a citizen , i 'd have shot me , too , ' " one of the escapees said , according to @entity11			1
" you 're down in southeast @entity4 , the gun belt , and people will protect themselves			1
" a tracking dog eventually led authorities to the salvage yard in a rural part of @entity3			1
the sheriff said he still believes the inmates intended to leave the area , but a combination of factors -- including the fact they were exposed and a large law enforcement team looking for them -- contributed to their capture			2
" @entity105 was on our side this time , as well as a lot of good teamwork , " @entity11 said .			0
