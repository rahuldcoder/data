-- @entity1 spent almost three decades in jail , but he was n't alone -- he had two @entity4 goddesses and a 17th century playwright for company			1
locked in solitary confinement on @entity9 , newspapers were banned and letters from loved ones a rare treat			0
where did he find the inspiration to continue his long struggle for freedom ? as the twittersphere explodes with quotes from the legendary leader , it 's perhaps easy to forget there was a time when @entity1 was in need of a few words of wisdom himself			1
he found them in the musings of another great thinker -- one born centuries before and on the other side of the world			0
a tattered book covered in luminous @entity35 deities might have seemed like a strange choice for the @entity38 political activist languishing in his cell			1
but the beatifically smiling women on the cover knew something the prison wardens did n't			0
@entity44 was the " @entity49 , " and the historic text became a source of strength for @entity1 and his fellow inmates during their darkest days			1
a bible by any other name it became known as the " @entity53 , " and today is one of the most remarkable artifacts from @entity1 's 27 years in jail			2
" what resonance does a white guy from @entity64 400 years ago have to a group of @entity38 political prisoners in the latter half of the 20th century ? " said @entity57 , who wrote a play based on the " @entity53 , " and interviewed many of the inmates who read it			0
" there 's this universality to @entity70 -- including many lessons on good and bad leadership -- and i think @entity1 found resonance in his words			1
he once said that ' to be taken seriously as a politician , one must always quote from @entity70 , ' and a lot of his speeches when he was president did just that			2
" the valiant the book was smuggled into the jail by political prisoner @entity81 , who disguised it in colorful @entity84 cards celebrating the @entity35 festival of lights , convincing the warden it was his bible			1
between 1975 and 1978 , the volume was passed between 33 of @entity81 's fellow prisoners -- including @entity1			2
many of the inmates signed and dated their names beside particularly poignant passages -- words of hardship , political unrest , or injustice			2
@entity1 chose a passage from @entity99 -- just before the @entity101 statesman leaves for the senate on the @entity103 -- and his sweeping handwriting on the now - yellowing page is a haunting reminder of the activist 's dedication to his cause			1
it includes the lines : " cowards die many times before their deaths / the valiant never taste of death but once			0
" " i believe when @entity1 signed this passage , he recognized this book would get out and be circulated in the liberation movement -- his would be the quote people looked to , " said @entity57			1
" it was an incredibly powerful quote -- he lived his entire life according to these two lines			0
" lasting impression the quote is all the more poignant considering @entity1 's speech during the 1960s @entity127 , where he said : " if need be , it is an ideal for which i am prepared to die			0
" @entity1 signed the passage december 16 , 1977			1
he never could have imagined that december 16 would later be known as " @entity130 " in @entity38 -- a public holiday which only came into effect after the fall of apartheid			0
while @entity57 believes the " @entity53 " began as an attempt by @entity81 to gain the autographs of the most famous political activists at the time , it has now become a powerful memento of their many years -- and sources of inspiration -- behind bars			0
" it was amazing to see visitors from all over the world drawn to this book like a magnet , " said @entity145 , professor of @entity146 at @entity147 , who helped curate the @entity149 's @entity70 exhibition last year			2
" it was a coming together of one of the greatest writers of humanity , and one of the greatest humans of the 20th century			0
with @entity1 's death comes a particular poignancy in a passage referring to the death of the valiant			1

@entity1 quotes *flood* *social* media . but what inspired man himself ?
answer : " @entity172 , " @entity70 book disguised in @entity35 cards
book was smuggled into jail by fellow political prisoner
