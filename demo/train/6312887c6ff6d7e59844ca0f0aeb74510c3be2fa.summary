when @entity2 was assassinated on february 21 , 1965 , many @entity0 viewed his killing as simply the result of an ongoing feud between him and the @entity7			1
he had publicly left the @entity7 in march 1964 , and as the months wore on the animus between @entity2 's camp and the @entity7 grew increasingly caustic , with bitter denunciations coming from both sides			1
a week before he was killed , @entity2 's home -- owned by the @entity7 , which was seeking to evict him -- was firebombed , and @entity2 believed members of the @entity7 to be responsible			1
for investigators and commentators alike , then , his death was an open and shut case : @entity18 did it			0
yet although three members of the @entity7 were tried and found guilty for the killing , two of them maintained their innocence and decades of research has since cast doubt on the outcome of the case			0
tens of thousands of declassified pages documenting government surveillance , infiltration and disruption of black leaders and organizations -- including @entity2 and the @entity7 -- suggest the conclusions drawn by law enforcement were self - serving			2
furthermore , irregularities in how investigators and prosecutors handled the case reflect at best gross negligence , and at worst something more sinister			0
at the time of his death , @entity42 remembered @entity2 unsympathetically as " a pimp , a cocaine addict and a thief " and " an unashamed demagogue			2
" but for those who had been paying closer attention to him , @entity2 was an uncompromising advocate for the urban poor and working - class black @entity0			2
instead of advocating integration , he called for self - determination ; instead of nonviolence in the face of violent anti-black attacks , he called for self - defense			0
he reserved moral appeals for other people committed to social justice ; the government , on the other hand , he understood in terms of organized power -- to be challenged , disrupted and / or dismantled -- and sought to leverage alliances with newly independent @entity66 states to challenge that power			0
it was his challenge to the organized power of the state that appealed to growing numbers of african - americans , and it was this challenge that also attracted a close following among federal , state and local law enforcement			0
under @entity76 director @entity78 's watch , the @entity76 kept close tabs on @entity2 's every move through the use of informants and agents			1
even before @entity2 began attracting large audiences and widespread media coverage in the late 1950s and early ' 60s , the @entity76 reported on his efforts to organize @entity7 mosques around the country			2
one organizing meeting in a private home in @entity91 in 1954 had maybe a dozen or so people present ; one of them reported to the @entity76			0
after @entity2 left the @entity7 in march 1964 , agents pondered the prospect of a depoliticized more religious @entity2 , but still perceived him as a threat			2
on june 5 , 1964 , @entity78 sent a telegram to the @entity76 's @entity101 office that simply and plainly instructed , " do something about @entity2 enough of this black violence in @entity101			2
" one wonders , what that " something " was			0
in @entity101 , the @entity76 's actions were complemented by , if not coordinated with , the @entity109 's @entity108 , which regularly logged license plates of cars parked outside mosques , organizational meetings , business and homes			2
the actions of the police on the day of @entity2 's assassination are particularly noteworthy			1
normally up to two dozen police were assigned at @entity2 's rallies , but on february 21 , just a week after his home had been firebombed , not one officer was stationed at the entrance to the @entity124 where the meeting took place			1
and while two uniformed officers were inside the building , they remained in a smaller room , at a distance from the main event area			0
the lack of a police presence was unusual and was compounded by internal compromises on the part of @entity2 's own security staff , which included at least one @entity108 agent who had infiltrated his organization			1
reportedly at @entity2 's request , his security had abandoned the search procedure that had been customary at both @entity7 and @entity143 / @entity145 meetings			1
without the search procedure , his armed assassins were able to enter the ballroom undetected			0
when the assassins stood up to shoot @entity2 , his security guards stationed at the front of the stage moved not to secure him , but to clear out of the way			2
these anomalies , in and of themselves , could have been inconsequential			0
but combined , even if just by coincidence , they proved to be deadly , and allowed for one of the most prophetic revolutionary voices of the 20th century to be silenced			0
the investigation that followed was just as careless			0
the crime scene was not secured for extensive forensic analysis -- instead , it was cleaned up to allow for a scheduled dance to take place that afternoon , with bullet holes still in the wall ! for activists , of course , @entity2 's death took on greater significance than law enforcement publicly expressed			1
@entity174 chairman @entity173 was among the first to suggest that @entity2 's murder was more than just an act of sectarian violence between two rival black organizations			1
" i believe this was a political killing , " he asserted , in response to @entity2 's growing national profile within the civil rights movement			1
he called for a federal inquiry -- unbeknownst to @entity186 , an ironic request given the level of covert federal oversight that was already in place			0
slowly , @entity186 's doubts gained considerable traction			0
author and journalist @entity193 , who had covered @entity2 and the @entity7 on several occasions , put @entity2 's assassination in context with @entity198 's in " to kill a @entity199 " ( 1968 )			1
more than four decades ago , activist @entity200 was among the first to challenge the police version of who was responsible for @entity2 's death			1
more recently , the work done at @entity206 's @entity205 , culminating in @entity208 's @entity207 - winning " @entity2 : a life of @entity214 , " echoed these doubts and put at the forefront these unanswered questions about @entity2 's murder			1
they call upon us to revisit not just the political significance of @entity2 's life , but the implications of his murder			1
our government especially deserves scrutiny for its covert information gathering , disinformation campaigns , and even violence waged against its own citizens			0
fifty years later , we still have more to learn from @entity2 's life , and his death , and our government 's actions toward him .			1
