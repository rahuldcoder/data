" this is a topic worth discussing			0

one of the most amazing death row stories we talked about during wednesday 's hangout surrounded a @entity44 man named @entity45			1

in fact , two federal judges wrote in an appellate court opinion that there was " persuasive evidence " that @entity57 agents in the case were " dishonest			0
