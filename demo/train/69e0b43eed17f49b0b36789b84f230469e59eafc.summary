-- despite @entity3 's recent medical scare that dominated music news for days , the visionary rapper is on track to release his new album , " @entity7 , " on tuesday			1
( and that 's despite it having leaked a few days ago to file - sharing sites )			0
according to @entity12 , @entity3 's manager and the chief visionary officer of his @entity15 label , @entity3 's new effort captures him at his career 's most vital moment yet			1
@entity3 receives hospital visits from @entity19 , @entity20 and more " it 's mixtape @entity3 -- straight street bangers you 're going to hear in the club , " @entity12 says			1
" the sound is more urban , with no @entity27 hooks , and the wordplay is still incredible and shocking -- every bar has some witty punchline			0
@entity3 really took it back to his roots			1
" " it reminds me of the traditional @entity34 sound , " adds @entity33 , @entity34 's co-founder who also rhymes under his birdman alias			0
" he went back to raw rapping and beats with lots of swagger			0
" of course , rap 's resident alien does n't exactly do basic : take the @entity43 - produced " @entity44 , " featuring @entity20			0
" it 's not a normal hip - hop track , " notes @entity12			2
" at first , i thought it was kinda weird -- the beat sounds like it came from outer - space -- but it grew on me , and @entity20 killed it			0
" @entity3 , @entity33 's daughters writing ' @entity53 ' novel @entity20 heads up a stellar guest list including @entity19 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58			1

" " @entity59 just kills on that , " @entity12 says			0
" @entity3 said he almost could n't get his bars off because @entity59 's voice is so nice			1
" from advance notice , " @entity7 " also seems to be a @entity69 movement unto itself : former @entity71 mastermind @entity70 produces and raps on a few cuts , and @entity78 's self - proclaimed " baddest b * * * * " @entity73 appears on the @entity75 - assisted cut " @entity76			1
" @entity3 keeps the vibes diverse in " @entity81 's " gritty urban gumbo , moving from the topical rant " @entity83 " -- featuring the sure - to - be - controversial chorus " @entity85 / this godless @entity86 " -- to downright love jams like " romance			1
" @entity3 thanks fans for support during hospital stay " that 's one for the females , " @entity12 explains			2
" it 's about real love and relationships			0
@entity3 's delivery on the song is crazy -- it really penetrates			2
" according to @entity12 , such diversity is par for the @entity3 course			2
@entity3 remains a master of hip - hop 's many moods : as such , the album 's eerie , @entity107 - designed cover art featuring a blood - red moth provides perfect symbolism for @entity3 's latest evolution , suggesting this is n't the last we 've heard from him			1
" moths always transform into butterflies , " @entity12 explains			0
" @entity3 continues to reinvent himself , but every phase always ends up a beautiful thing			2
