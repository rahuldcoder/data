" the 17 - minute video also showed an unusual sight : @entity7 members shaking hands with men from the @entity5			1
the @entity53 said wednesday it has no reason to doubt the video 's authenticity			2

" regardless , we know the transfer was peaceful and successful , and our focus remains on getting sgt. @entity18 the care he needs			2
" @entity63 , a former covert operations officer for the @entity64 , said there 's a clear purpose behind the video			2
" the @entity7 does n't operate in a bubble			1
they do n't live in a cave			0
they understand the importance of social media			0
they understand the importance of marketing and public relations , " he told @entity75 's @entity74			0
" this is a scripted propaganda piece for them			0
... and so they 're doing this , in a sense , to show their credibility , to show their strength as warriors to their supporters , and to try to use it as a recruiting tool			0
" @entity18 : strong , well - rounded and easy to talk to , friends say surrounded by @entity45 at one point in the video , @entity7 members start chanting , " long live @entity45 of @entity34 , long live @entity96 , the leader of @entity7			1
" @entity45 refers to those who carry out jihad			0

" the video has few words in @entity125 , other than this message superimposed over @entity18 : " don'come back to @entity34 " narrator in video : ' he was fine ' in the video , the narrator also gives his opinion about an issue that 's become a focal point since @entity18 's release : the soldier 's health			1
" they first asked us about the health condition of the captive and told us to tell them the truth if he was not well , but we saw him , that he was fine , and we told them that , " the narrator says			0
since announcing @entity18 's release over the weekend , @entity146 administration officials have repeatedly said they fast - tracked the operation over concerns about his health and safety , which appeared to be in jeopardy			1
recent intelligence , in addition to two proof - of - life videos of @entity18 released in recent months , led to growing concern about his health and safety , a senior defense official said wednesday			2
@entity159 , the @entity160 's former lead international hostage negotiator , said that might have been exactly what @entity18 's captors wanted			1
" you expect the hostage - takers to make it look like the hostage is in bad shape so that they can drive a better bargain , and clearly it looks to me that 's what they did here , " he told @entity75 's " the lead with @entity177 " on wednesday			0
deserter or hero ? national security adviser @entity180 said @entity18 served with honor and distinction			2
but there 's a growing chorus of criticism from some who served with him , describing him as a deserter			0
" i believe that he totally deserted not only his fellow soldiers , but his leadership that wanted the best for him and for our country , " said former @entity19 staff sgt. @entity191 , who was @entity18 's squad leader			1
some soldiers involved in operations to find @entity18 have said at least six soldiers were killed searching for him			2
asked about this point , defense secretary @entity199 told reporters wednesday that he did not know of specific circumstances or details of soldiers dying as a result of the efforts to find @entity18			2
@entity191 told " @entity209 " that he believes @entity18 is at least partly to blame for the soldiers ' deaths			2
" i ca n't really say i blame @entity18 to fullest extent , but if he would n't have deserted us , these soldiers very well could have been in a different place at a different time , " he said			1
an @entity19 fact - finding investigation conducted in the months after @entity18 's 2009 disappearance concluded that he left his outpost deliberately and on his own free will , according to a @entity0 military official briefed on the report			1
the official spoke to @entity75 on tuesday on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the information			0
there was no definitive finding @entity18 deserted because that would require knowing his intent -- something @entity19 officials could n't do without talking to the soldier			1
on wednesday , a @entity0 official said that commanders referred to @entity18 as a " good soldier " in that initial fact - finding report , and that fellow soldiers said he 'd left the post on other occasions			2
the official , who has been briefed on the investigation , said the report said that @entity18 had mailed his computer and other items home before his disappearance , but his motivation was unclear			2
@entity246 said wednesday that it 's " unfair " to @entity18 and his family to presume anything about his motivations for leaving the base			1
he reiterated that the @entity19 will conduct a review of the case			0
@entity246 spoke with @entity18 's family via telephone wednesday , a senior defense official told reporters			1
the defense secretary reassured them that @entity18 would continue getting support with regard to his medical care and reintegration , and that the department was focused on their son 's health , the official said			1
@entity18 will remain at a @entity19 medical center in @entity271 until he completes treatment , a @entity0 defense official there told @entity75			2
after that , @entity18 will return to the @entity0 and go to a @entity275 military base , the official said			1
as the debate over @entity18 showed no sign of slowing wednesday , his hometown of @entity277 , @entity278 , canceled a " @entity18 is back " event planned to celebrate his return " in the interest of public safety			1
" organizers , the city said , expected a large number of supporters and protesters to increase attendance			0
" @entity277 , a town of 8,000 , does not have the infrastructure to support an event of the size this could become , " the city said			0
controversial swap @entity18 's captors handed him over to the @entity0 in exchange for the release of five prisoners held at @entity301 , @entity302			1
the @entity304 detainees swapped for @entity18 : who are they ? both democrats and @entity307 have criticized the deal , arguing that it puts @entity0 lives at risk by releasing terrorists and accusing @entity146 of breaking the law by not notifying @entity313 30 days in advance			1
administration officials have said they consulted the @entity316 and acted legally			0
but some @entity307 lawmakers have said they 're not buying that argument , and want proof that @entity18 's health was really in jeopardy			1
" this @entity0 is going home to his family , " sen. @entity322 told @entity75 's " @entity328 " before heading into a classified @entity324 briefing on @entity18 on wednesday			1
" these five members of the @entity7 are going back to the battlefield			1
" afterward , @entity322 and several other @entity307 told reporters that the briefing had done nothing to stem their skepticism			1
" i remain increasingly convinced that the president has now set a precedent that will encourage enemies of the @entity0 to target @entity0 men and women in uniform , " he said			0
rep. @entity341 , chairwoman of the @entity342 , said criticism from lawmakers who 'd long been pushing for @entity146 to help bring @entity18 home is " disingenuous			2
" " we had intelligence , from everything that i understand ... that this was our last , best opportunity , that he was potentially on death 's door			0
looking at grainy video is not a way for us to determine that			0
but from everything i understand , this was our last best opportunity , " she said			0
@entity357 , a former @entity358 legal adviser in president @entity360 's administration , told @entity75 that the prisoner swap deal was " defensible			0
" " this is one of those tough national security situations that presidents face , " he said , " where all the options are bad			0
" @entity367 wanted a tougher deal with @entity7 for @entity18 ? was @entity18 swap legal ? depends on who you ask @entity18 : a deserter or a hero ?			1
