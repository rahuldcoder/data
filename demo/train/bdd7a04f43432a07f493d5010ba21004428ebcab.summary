-- what was , in retrospect , most heroic about @entity3 , who died saturday at age 82 , was the manner in which he shied away from the spoils and trappings of heroism itself			1
being the first man on the moon , after all , would seem to place you on top of the world , providing a kind of lifetime pass to wherever you wanted to go -- and whatever you wanted to be			1
thinking of running for office ? name the district , state or country and it 's yours			2
maybe you 'd like to go into business			2
the line of people with dotted lines to sign stretches from here to infinity			2
and so do their wallets			0
show biz ? hmmm -- that 's a tough one			0
you and @entity32 were n't exactly magic together on that @entity34 tour			0
but , well , we can make something happen , right ? this is @entity38 , after all , and you are the @entity40 ! @entity3 's one small step resonated for all mankind but @entity3 , a native of @entity43 , @entity44 , so steeped in flying that his idea of winding down was piloting gliders in his spare time , wanted exactly none of those options			1
having his choice of any possible future after leaving @entity52 in 1971 , he chose to go back to his home state and teach aerospace engineering at the @entity55			1
it was an unusual , but , by then , hardly surprising move by the laconic commander of @entity59 , the july 1969 mission that fulfilled president @entity61 's mandate for an @entity38 lunar landing within a decade			0
before , during and after that epochal journey , @entity3 came across as something of an enigma to global media anxious to make him the brightest star on @entity68			1
this was going to be tough			0
rather than having the jaunty wit of a @entity71 , the affable magnetism of a @entity73 or the flinty swagger of a @entity76 , @entity3 came across as nothing more than the earnest , no - nonsense engineer he actually was			1
no artifice , no flash , no -- well , frankly , no star power to speak of			2
within the fraternity of test pilots , however , @entity3 was among the brightest of stars			1
before being chosen in 1962 as one of the " @entity94 " astronauts -- which included @entity89 commander @entity88 along with such legends as @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 -- @entity3 was one of the elite pilots selected to fly the @entity97 rocket plane up to five times the speed of sound and toward the edge of space			1
remembering @entity3 and that no - nonsense demeanor served @entity3 well in his work			1
as command pilot of the march 1966 @entity105 mission , the first in which one spacecraft docked with another vehicle in orbit , @entity3 showed cool composure when a malfunctioning thruster caused his two - man spacecraft to tumble end over end			1
his decision - making may have prematurely ended the mission , but it saved his life , co-pilot @entity119 's life , and possibly the whole @entity38 space program			0
and yet , all many people remembered about that flight was that its mishap pre-empted that night 's broadcast of @entity127 's " @entity126			0
" @entity3 's seemingly casual reaction to peril left his @entity52 colleagues in awe when , in may 1968 , he picked exactly the right time to eject from a lunar landing simulator that had spun out of control			1
his only injury was a bitten tongue sustained after parachuting to safety			0
he was back at his office , working , that same afternoon			0
few of these facts were widely known by the public when @entity3 , along with @entity141 and @entity142 , was picked for the lunar landing mission			1
all people knew about the astronaut who would turn out to be the first man on the moon was what they saw			1
and what they saw mystified them			0
in press conferences and interviews before the @entity59 flight , @entity3 spoke mostly in clipped , dry sentences , almost as if he were transmitting radio messages from a distance while still on @entity68			1
@entity156 , assigned by @entity157 to cover the flight , found him in press conferences to be " extraordinarily remote ... apparently in communion with some string in the universe others did not think to unravel			0
" even those famous first words upon stepping off the @entity166 -- " that 's one small step for man			2
one giant leap for mankind			0
" -- resounded to a waiting world as tentative , fragmented ; almost as if they had to be pulled from @entity3 after a struggle			1
yet over the span of 40 - plus years , those eleven words have achieved iconic stature in no small way because of the unassuming manner in which they were uttered			0
@entity3 taught at @entity55 for eight years before leaving in 1979 , characteristically without explanation			1
he was hardly a recluse afterward , though he maintained a relatively low profile ; lower , anyway , than you 'd expect for the first man on the moon			2
he sat on boards of banks and corporations and served on various commissions , including the one investigating the 1986 challenger disaster			0
( that panel included another space pioneer , @entity190 , who died little more than a month ago			0
) obituaries 2012 : the lives they 've lived he was cautious about giving interviews and autographs , hawkish about the use of his name and of anything related to his @entity59 mission			0
while his fellow @entity59 moon - walker , @entity141 , seemed up for anything from " @entity205 " to " @entity206 " ( and he 's been a wry and inspirational figure to have on the scene ) , @entity3 kept his distance from the media circus beyond authorizing a biography , " @entity212 : the life of @entity3 , " in 2005			1
if he raised his voice in public at all , it had only to do with space exploration and his growing sorrow over @entity38 's gradual withdrawal from taking the initiative in manned flight			0
still , by his ninth decade on @entity68 , @entity3 seemed to be more relaxed in public and generally more visible than he used to be			2
if anything , his time hugging the corners of fame made him seem even more admirable as a man who refused to sell himself or his legacy out , no matter what temptations were available in a celebrity - crazed culture			1
for one spellbinding week 43 summers ago , @entity3 did something that once seemed unimaginable			2
since then , he lived his life in a way that now seems improbable			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity236 .			2

@entity236 : @entity3 was a star test pilot , cool and decisive under stress
he says @entity3 chose not to exploit his *historic* role as the first man on the moon
after leaving @entity52 , he taught aerospace engineering at the @entity55
@entity246 : @entity3 refused to sell out himself , or his legacy , despite the temptations of fame
