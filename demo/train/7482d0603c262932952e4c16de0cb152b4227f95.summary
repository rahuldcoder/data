since sir @entity1 and his sherpa guide , @entity4 , first conquered @entity5 in 1953 , thousands of trekkers have tried to follow their footsteps			1
according to the @entity8 @entity7 , more than 3,500 have successfully climbed the 8,848 - meter ( 29,029 - foot ) mountain , the world 's highest			2
more than a tenth of that number scaled the summit last year alone			0
but with the mountaineers ' lofty dreams come a price : a trail of trash that now threatens the peak 's environment			0
a group of 15 artists in @entity8 are turning that trash into art. under a project called " @entity25			1
@entity33 " created last year , they have collected 1.5 tons of garbage brought down by climbers from the mountain , including remains of a helicopter that had crashed into the slopes during the 1970s			1
" with this collaboration we aimed to raise awareness about pollution at @entity5 , " explained @entity34 , director of @entity35 , the organization that initiated the project			1
working tediously for a month , the artists transformed oxygen cylinders , cans , glass bottles and discarded trekking tools into 74 pieces of art and held their first of many exhibitions for interested buyers in november 2012			1
geographer reaches @entity5 summit amidst tragedy " many of the artworks reflect mountain life and mountaineering experiences , " says artist @entity53			2
" it was interesting what we came up with , and how this trash could turn into something beautiful			2
" " the visitors are amazed by the artwork , and we 've received encouraging feedback			0
we hope our creations will help inspire actions against pollution at the @entity5 , " @entity66 , another artist , said			1
the exhibitions have attracted more than 3,800 visitors , with the pieces priced from $ 17 to $ 2,400			1
nineteen pieces have been sold so far , and part of the proceeds will be given to @entity76 , which has collaborated with the project			2
the association was the first to initiate a cleanup trip to @entity25			0
@entity5 in 2005 and has continued its efforts to make the mountain pollution free			1
" each expedition to @entity5 is required to take a garbage deposit and bring their waste back , " @entity82 , the group 's general secretary , said			1
" but this system has not been strictly implemented			0
" in last two years , the association has collected over 10 tons of garbage from the @entity5 , but it estimates that another 10 tons are still littering the slopes			1
according to the association , biodegradable garbage is separated from the collection and turned into compost at @entity96 , the major stop point before the base camp			2
but much of the garbage comprises non-degradable items such as oxygen cylinders , tin cans , and plastic and glass bottles			0
these are airlifted to @entity8 's capital , @entity106			0
turning trash into art is one way of managing waste			0
@entity35 says it will continue working on similar projects			0
" we hope our creative works of art will inspire and encourage people to keep the mountains clean , " @entity34 said			0
is @entity5 like a ' morgue ' ?			0
