-- @entity2 's death comes only days before 2012 , the 100 - year anniversary of the birth of @entity6 's founder and @entity2 's father , @entity7			1
@entity6 's long - planned celebration of this anniversary will now be pre-empted by collective shows of mourning ( but perhaps few real tears for @entity2 ) , uncertainty despite clearly laid plans for succession and heightened strategic anxiety among @entity6 's neighbors			1
over the last two years , @entity2 had put into place a succession plan ( similar to the one his father had put into place for him ) by naming his third son , @entity21 , to key posts in the @entity23 and @entity24			2
just as @entity2 was named head of the funeral committee for his father in 1994 , @entity21 will lead the funeral committee for his father			1
there will be the compulsory large crowds of mourners in the streets of @entity32 to honor @entity2			2
a collective leadership , including top party and military leaders and relatives of @entity21 , will provide guidance			0
@entity2 observed a three - year " mourning period " before he formally took the reins of leadership and began participating in public functions			2
no one knows if this delay , which coincided with @entity6 's famine , was also a result of internecine leadership struggles			0
will the new succession unfold according to plan ? @entity6 's political system is closer to a dynasty than a modern state , but it can no longer live in isolation from the modern world			1
@entity2 was successor - in - waiting for two decades , his son only two years			2
@entity2 came to power in his 50s ; @entity21 in his late 20s			2
@entity6 's system is less centralized and possibly less capable of exerting political control in 2011 , compared with 1994 , since money has replaced ideological loyalty as the essential ingredient for getting ahead			1
@entity2 allowed institutions -- with the exception of the military -- to atrophy before belatedly revamping the party apparatus in september 2010			0
the system is fragmented and stovepiped so that only the leader can exercise control			0
a vacuum at the top could lead to bureaucratic infighting , with no person able to step in and exert authority across institutions			1
the worst case would be anarchy or infighting among bureaucratic factions for political control			1
the main advantage that @entity21 has is that the core leadership knows that if it does n't hang together , it will hang separately			0
there is no viable alternative for survival among elites if the regime fails			0
@entity87 reacts to @entity2 's death @entity6 's neighbors will watch developments warily , but they will also be watching each other as closely as they watch @entity32 , if not more so			1
for some time , @entity92 has pulled out the stops to underwrite economic stability in @entity6 , and it fears that @entity96 intervention to restore order in @entity6 might lead to a reunified peninsula allied to the @entity99			0
@entity96 fears that the @entity6 's economic dependency on @entity92 will give @entity92 political leverage to deny @entity96 the ability to lead the way to @entity96 unification			2
the @entity99 worries that either instability or desperation may lead to proliferation of @entity6 bombs or fissile material			1
@entity110 and @entity111 also have interests that lead them both to prefer stability on the @entity115			0
an unstable @entity6 is a hot potato : no one wants to own it , but strategic fears forestall effective cooperation among its neighbors			0
@entity6 instability would require extensive resources just at the moment when the world is cash - strapped			0
for this reason , @entity6 's neighbors will exercise caution , keep their fingers crossed and hope against hope that @entity6 's new leadership can chart a more reformist ( and less nuclear ) path than did @entity2			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity136 .			0

@entity136 says @entity2 's death *introduces* uncertainty , anxiety in region
