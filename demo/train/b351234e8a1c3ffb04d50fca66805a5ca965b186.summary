@entity0 -- though she may have had numerous husbands and lovers , @entity3 icon @entity2 had one enduring love : jewelry			1
her dazzling collection of jewels , many of which were given to her as presents by husbands including @entity14 and @entity15 , were referred to friday in @entity0 by @entity16 , deputy chairman of @entity17 , as " the crown jewels of @entity3			1
" fans of the screen idol can now ogle highlights from her extensive jewelry collection , along with a selection of her haute couture dresses by designers including @entity27 and @entity28 , and paintings by artists such as @entity31 and @entity32 , at @entity34 's auction house in @entity0			1
they are being exhibited there as part of a world tour that will culminate in a series of high - profile sales at @entity34 in @entity40 in december			2
@entity2 's jewel collection has been valued in excess of $ 30 million , according to the auction house			1
@entity44 , head of the jewelry department at @entity34 in @entity0 , said that @entity2 's taste in jewels was " extraordinarily refined			1
she really understood her gemstones ( [ and ) she had a passion for design and workmanship , quite a rare combination			0
" and not only do they speak of her infamous and tempestuous romance with actor @entity14 , he said , the jewels come with their own dramatic histories -- such as a 50 - carat pearl known as " @entity58 , " given to her by @entity14 in 1969 , that was once part of the crown jewels of @entity62			1
it was mounted onto a specially commissioned diamond and ruby @entity65 necklace and is estimated to fetch between $ 2 million and $ 3 million at auction in december			0
there is also the @entity71 diamond pendant necklace , which @entity14 gave her on her 40th birthday in 1972 and which had been a gift from the mughal emperor @entity75 to his wife in the 17th century			2
" if a jewel had a historic provenance , they were particularly enamored , " said @entity44 of the pair 's taste in gems			2
according to @entity83 , co-author of the book " @entity85 : @entity2 , @entity14 , @entity89 , " @entity2 developed a taste for jewels from a young age			1
" her father was an art and antiques dealer , " @entity83 explained			0
" she grew up surrounded by beautiful things and was always drawn to jewelry as a young girl , " she said			0
but it was n't until @entity2 's marriage to film and @entity98 producer @entity15 that her passion for collecting serious jewels took hold , @entity83 said			1
@entity15 , her third husband , bought @entity2 a 29.4 - carat diamond ring as well as a diamond tiara , which she wore to the 1957 @entity104			1
@entity83 believes that when @entity14 bought @entity2 the 33.19 - carat @entity105 in 1968 -- possibly the star piece in the exhibition at @entity34 , estimated to fetch between $ 2.5 million and $ 3.5 million -- he was trying to out - do @entity15 , who had died unexpectedly just over a year into his marriage with @entity2			1
" i think that was a big deal for @entity14 , to buy her a diamond as big as @entity15 's			2
and he liked showing that the son of a @entity116 coal - miner could buy his lady love these extravagant jewels , " she said			2
@entity44 believes that the collection will induce feverish bidding in the salesroom , for the quality of the collection but also for their added @entity3 glamor			2
" judging from past sales , which have never been as spectacular as this one -- i think the sky 's the limit , " he said			0
the actress , who died this year aged 79 , eulogized her love of gems in her 2002 memoir , " @entity135			0
" in it , she wrote : " i never , never thought of my jewelry as trophies			0
i 'm here to take care of them and to love them			0
when i die and they go off to auction i hope whoever buys them gives them a really good home			0
" at a press conference on friday , @entity148 's said that the collection reveals " one of the great characters , this was one of the great stars , this was someone who understood her contract with the public			0
" @entity44 agreed and said , " looking at the couture , you can see that she was not a very large lady but obviously with the hair , with the presence , with the glamor , it all added up to something very fabulous			0
" in memory of the actress 's life - long devotion to humanitarian causes , a portion of profits generated by admissions , events and select publications related to the sales will be donated to the @entity176 ( @entity177 ) , which she set up in 1991			0
" highlights from the collection of @entity2 " is on public display at @entity34 , @entity0 , on 24 , 25 and 26 september , after which it will travel to @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 and finally , @entity40 .			1
