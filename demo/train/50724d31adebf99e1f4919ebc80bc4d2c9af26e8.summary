-- let the @entity2 speculation begin			1
@entity3 is kicking off production on a new @entity2 in the coming months and could announce the device this summer , according to a report in @entity7			1
the phone would have the same size and shape as the @entity12 , and @entity3 might also be working on a cheaper model to sell in developing countries , the report said			1
the @entity7 story contained no details about what features the next @entity2 might contain , although each new @entity2 model has historically boasted a more powerful processor and an upgraded camera			1
it would n't be shocking for @entity3 to release an @entity2 in the summer			1
the company has released a new @entity2 model every year since the device debuted in 2007 , and the release dates have all been in the summer or fall			1
the @entity12 came out in september 2012 , the @entity26 in october 2011 , and the three versions before that in the summer months			0
one possible launchpad for the as - yet - unnamed new device could be @entity3 's annual @entity31 , typically held each june in @entity32			2
exact dates for @entity31 have not been announced			0
the @entity7 report 's more interesting nuggets are about the cheaper , more colorful @entity2 version			1
the report says @entity3 has been " working on different color shells " for the less expensive model			2
there have been rumblings about a cheaper iphone for a while now			0
the company has often put quality above affordability , but to be competitive in the booming @entity48 and @entity49 markets , it will need to drop the price of its lower - end phones			0
older , less expensive @entity2 versions continue to sell well but are still pricey when compared with the array of cheap @entity55 handsets			0
the @entity7 cites people " familiar with the device 's production " as sources for its report			2
these periodic crumbs of leaked information about @entity3 launches may help the company , which presents itself as extremely secretive about future products			0
such occasional @entity3 rumor stories keep the @entity2 in the minds of smartphone buyers and could influence their decisions about what phone to buy next			1
it 's been six months since @entity3 released a major new product , and as @entity74 recently noted , its fans may be growing restless			0
@entity3 may also feel pressure to release a new @entity2 soon to compete with archrival @entity76 , whose popular @entity78 line has emerged as a credible competitor			2
reports of new products also would probably look good to @entity3 investors .			0

@entity3 to begin production on latest @entity2 model soon , @entity7 says
the new model could be ready by this summer
a cheaper , more colorful version of the @entity2 might also be in production
