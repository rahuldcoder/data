-- known as the cradle of the @entity3 , @entity1 is a culture - rich city in the heart of @entity5 , @entity6			1
over the centuries , it has been home to @entity3 masters @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 , who have left their legacy in a trove of art and architecture that is world renowned			1
it is this rich legacy that inspires art - lovers to visit , and in summer the city is crammed with tourists determined to make the most of the city 's treasures			1
while small , @entity1 contains a quarter of the planet 's @entity28 world heritage sites , which can be overwhelming for first - time visitors			1
with this ratio of classics - per - square - meter , it 's impossible to see everything in one visit -- but here is a selection of @entity0 's cultural highlights			2
a good starting point is @entity1 's cathedral , @entity41 ( @entity42 ) , whose teracotta - and - white dome dominates the city 's skyline			1
the building 's ornate facade is decorated in pink , white and green marble			2
inside , however , the cathedral is refreshingly simple			0
the 700 - step climb up the inside of the dome -- architect @entity15 's 15th - century feat of engineering -- is not for the faint - hearted , but the views from the cupola are well worth it			2
also in the cathedral square is @entity59 , a belltower that soars into the @entity5 sky			0
with its magnificent statues , rich relief carvings and strong design , it exemplifies renaissance architecture			0
if heights do n't make you dizzy , iyou 'll also get a great view of the city from the top			0
one of the oldest art museums in the western world , the @entity73 is unmissable			0
come here for a who 's who of renaissance art : as well as @entity11 's " @entity78 " and " @entity79 , " the gallery houses " @entity81 , " attributed to @entity82 and @entity11 , as well as numerous works by @entity12 , @entity84 , @entity13 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 -- truly a visual feast			1
some believe that the @entity90 conceals a hidden treasure			0
it is thought that @entity11 's " @entity101 " could lie hidden behind one of @entity95 's frescoes , not least because @entity95 , who greatly admired @entity11 's work , has included the words " seek and you shall find " in one of his paintings			1
forensic art historian @entity102 is using infra - red rays to see if it 's there			0
@entity13 's sculpture " @entity112 " takes pride of place at the @entity109 , where you can also find @entity84 's " @entity111			1
" for more sculpture , head to the @entity114 , where you 'll find an impressive array of works by @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity82 , @entity13 and @entity120			2
at the museum of @entity11 , visitors flock to see life - size models of the artist 's ideas and inventions , from a glider to a tank , all carved from wood			1
it 's a great place to appreciate the range of @entity11 's creativity			1
if you 're footsore and feeling overwhelmed after racing around the key cultural sights , it might be time to head away from the crowds			0
over the @entity140 , famously lined by jewelry shops , is the @entity141 , seat of the @entity143 of @entity5 , and rising up behind it are the exquisite @entity145			0
take a picnic and climb up to the top , then congratulate yourself on escaping the crush and admire the view			0
alternatively , take a trip back to the @entity151 by listening to @entity154 's @entity153 monks sing gregorian chants during vespers at @entity1 's oldest church , dating back to the 11th century			1
it 's another spot that affords great views , as it sits at one of the highest points in @entity1			2
@entity1 is also strongly associated with @entity6 fashion			1
@entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165 were founded here , as was @entity166 , while @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 and others retain a strong presence in the city			0
the glossy boutiques can be found on @entity174 -- or you can follow the fashionistas and pick up some cut - price designer treats at the thriving designer outlets on the outskirts of @entity1			2
and if you are looking for something more offbeat , try the @entity182 , a zoology museum where you can find eerily accurate wax models of corpses , a multitude of stuffed animals and other @entity188 museum curiosities .			0

the cradle of the @entity3 , @entity1 has produced some of @entity6 's greatest artists
