-- @entity3 election officials will begin counting write - in ballots wednesday despite a federal court challenge by the campaign of @entity9 @entity8 candidate @entity7 , state director @entity1 said			1
the complaint filed in federal court tuesday afternoon asks @entity1 's office to " adhere " to state law in the counting of write - in ballots , limiting what the suit called " subjective " voter intent rules that were issued this week			2
@entity7 's campaign has blasted the @entity21 ' standards as " extraordinarily ambiguous			2
" the suit requests a court hearing wednesday over the rules and asks for an injunction			0
the guidelines say poll workers must consider the voter 's intent when determining whether to count a ballot for a write - in candidate			2
the @entity7 suit says , according to state election law , that a write - in vote ca n't be accepted if the voter did not correctly write either the full name or last name of a candidate ; the voter wrote a candidate 's name incorrectly , or misspelled it ; or the name written on the ballot is not the name used on the candidate 's certificate of candidacy			1
" the @entity49 has consistently maintained that every valid , lawful vote should be counted , " campaign attorney @entity47 said in a statement			0
" we have further held to the expectation that the state laws , as written , should be followed , and that they should not be changed now , after the votes have been cast			0
" yesterday , the state issued a new policy -- after the votes have been cast -- imposing a new election standard for write - in ballots , " he continued			1
" we believe this action to be unconstitutional and contrary to express legislative mandates			0
" @entity7 is believed to be locked in a tight race with incumbent sen. @entity65 , who ran as a write - in candidate			1
in last week 's election , @entity7 received 34 percent of the vote , democrat @entity67 , who conceded , collected 24 percent and 41 percent of ballots were for write - in candidates			1
based on pre-election polling , the vast majority of write - in votes are expected to go to @entity65 , who lost to @entity7 in the @entity9 primary			1
@entity65 , however , was one of 161 eligible write - in candidates , giving @entity7 hope that he might still win			1
he currently has about 13,000 fewer votes than the write - in total			2
" it is clear the @entity7 campaign wants to exclude as many votes from being counted as possible , " @entity65 campaign manager @entity79 said early wednesday			1
@entity65 said she intends to caucus with the @entity9 should she return to the @entity8			0
" i 'm not my party 's nominee , but i am a @entity9 , " she said			0
with a victory , @entity65 would avenge her august primary loss to @entity7 in the latest chapter of a feud with his main backers and her long - standing tension with former @entity3 gov. @entity91 , who backed @entity7			2
@entity65 was first appointed to her post by her father , then - gov. @entity93 , in 2002			0
@entity91 defeated him in the 2006 @entity9 gubernatorial primary			0
@entity0 's @entity95 and @entity96 contributed to this report .			0
