@entity0 -- @entity4 has completed the structures at a second missile launch site in the northwest part of the country , a @entity3 official said thursday			1
the admission comes on the same day that new satellite imagery , taken by @entity11 on january 10 , was released showing a tower , a movable launch pad and swing arms , according to an analysis by @entity16			1
" the facility comprises a rocket engine test stand , missile assembly and test buildings , a launch bunker and an observation tower , making it a more advanced facility than its other @entity4 counterpart at @entity25 , " according to a @entity16 description of the image			1
but the official said it is not clear whether the technical components , the electronics , are in place that would allow for a launch from the site , which is near @entity35			1
in either case , the official said , there is no indication that the @entity4 plan a test launch in the near term			1
the intelligence community has been closely watching the site for some time			0
the official , who asked not to be named because the official was not authorized to speak on the issue , said the location of the facility allows @entity4 to launch heavier payloads			1
the @entity47 would not comment on the new picture			0
" we do n't comment on press reports regarding intelligence matters			0
however , we continue to call on @entity4 to fulfill its international obligations ; cease provocative behaviors ; and take steps to improve relations with its neighbors , " said @entity47 spokesman col. @entity52 the nation previously announced it was working on developing the capacity to launch a space satellite			2
this site would allow them to do so but , the official cautioned , the site could also be used to launch intercontinental ballistic missiles ( @entity67 ) which could pose a threat to the @entity3 and other nations			1
" it 's a dual - use facility , " said the official			2
" the issue is intent			0
" the location of the facility also would allow @entity4 to launch a payload at an angle that would avoid an flight over other nations			2
the head of @entity3 military operations in @entity80 said that while he is not aware of any signs from @entity4 of a near term missile test , he anticipated that the next likely provocation from @entity4 could be in months , not years , due to a succession push			2
" due to the dynamics of @entity4 with succession and the long history of this occurring , our concerns are that we 're in a period of compressed time line for @entity97 to train @entity98 in these , in these coercive measures , " adm. @entity85 , commander of @entity86 , said thursday in a speech to the @entity88			0
" their continued development , export , proliferation of weapons will remain a regional challenge and an international challenge likely for some time to come ... so this is a major concern of ours ... it should concern us all			0
" in april 2009 , @entity4 attempted a test to launch what they said was a satellite into space from its other launch site near @entity25 , in the northeast			1
the missile flew over @entity118 before crashing into the sea			0
the launch was widely condemned .			0
