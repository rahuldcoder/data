president @entity0 is going to a top group of @entity3 business leaders wednesday , where he 's hoping to make his pitch for his agenda to the business community ahead of an incoming @entity8 majority in @entity9			1
@entity0 will tout economic gains in the private sector at a meeting of the @entity15 in @entity16 , where he 's also looking for support to advance issues like tax reform , trade and infrastructure , a @entity11 official said			1
the group , an association of top @entity3 ceos whose companies employ more than 16 million people , is a powerful force on @entity28 , spending more than $ 12 million in lobbying in 2013 according to the @entity30			0
the organization could be an important ally for @entity0 on key issues as he looks to bridge the gap with @entity8 on issues with some common ground , like tax reform			2
while traditionally backing @entity8 candidates and policies , the business community has n't pushed back as strongly against @entity40 as the @entity8 and have pushed leaders on @entity28 to rally around comprehensive immigration reform			0
and @entity0 will need to keep business leaders on his side over the public fight over @entity40 that is sure to flame up as the employer mandate kicks in at the beginning of next year			2
@entity0 could generate some good will as he spotlights the economic gains of his presidency : 10.6 million jobs added to the economy in 56 months , a booming stock market and near - record corporate profits , the @entity11 official said			0
" as the president has said , he is eager to work with the new @entity9 wherever possible to make the next two years as productive as possible , and will look to the business community as a partner in these efforts to continue to grow our economy and create opportunity , " the official said			0
the official did not mention immigration reform , but the topic could come up as he takes questions from a group of business leaders during the event that comes just weeks after @entity0 announced his executive actions to reform the immigration system and give legal status to more than 4 million undocumented immigrants			1
like other business groups , @entity15 did n't fully embrace @entity0 's executive action , though the group did n't rebuke it as @entity8 leaders did and the group 's policy director on immigration has said he 's hopeful @entity0 and @entity79 can work together to pass immigration legislation			1
@entity0 's meeting with the business group comes just hours before he meets with incoming senate majority leader @entity83 in the @entity84 wednesday afternoon .			0
