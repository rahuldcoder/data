@entity0 , @entity1 has resurfaced , analysts say			1
there have been whispers of a " jasmine revolution " on the internet and although calls for street protests have fallen flat so far , no matter : @entity1 appears jittery			1
the turmoil in the @entity7 has n't gotten much coverage in state - run media			1
there have been more police on the streets , dissidents reportedly under house arrest and social networking sites selectively blocked			0
why ? what does @entity1 fear ? @entity1 has had a history of walling itself from the outside world , fearful of foreign invasion and domination , from the times of the @entity34 to the @entity35 against the @entity36 through the brutal @entity38 imperialism of the 20th century			1
despite the @entity1 fascination with things foreign , historically there has been a fear among authorities of the influence of western culture			1
within its @entity46 , @entity1 has exerted strong control over its people			1
from the era of feudal warlords to modern @entity1 , rulers have been obsessed with avoiding bottom - up peasant revolts			1
" the perpetual question in the minds of all @entity1 was how chaos could best be avoided , " writes @entity53 in " @entity54 in @entity55 and @entity56			2
" " @entity60 thought as it developed from the earliest times onward , including @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 , was more than anything attempts to answer this question			0
" these dual fears -- domination from without and revolution within -- have been inherited by successive national leaders , especially after chairman @entity71			0
for two decades until his death in 1997 , @entity72 was driven to modernize @entity1 quickly while maintaining stability , ordering the brutal @entity76 crackdown in 1989 while single - mindedly pushing the reforms that opened and transformed his country			1
president @entity80 , seeking to build a " harmonious society , " last month called on @entity1 officials to learn " social management " to maintain stability			1
in his book " the @entity87 , " @entity85 wrote that " the fear of chaos , of losing political and social control ... runs like an iron spine through the entire @entity1 body politic			1
" @entity1 's economic transformation has been extraordinary			2
market reforms have unleashed individual initiative and entrepreneurship			0
hundreds of millions of farmers have been lifted out of poverty			0
gleaming new cities have been built			0
@entity1 's economy is now the second biggest in the world after the @entity103			1
yet despite these achievements , the @entity104 remains sensitive to criticism			0
analysts say the lack of a popular mandate through direct elections makes the party unsure of its own legitimacy and fearful of overthrow and disintegration			0
" they have no ideological justification for being in power , " said @entity115 , social science professor at the @entity116			0
" their political institutions -- the parliaments , courts , police -- are not independent ... they are often forced to rely on coercion to maintain power			0
" @entity1 's problem , @entity115 said , is that the country is undergoing the most rapid social change in history but with a weak legal system			1
" so problems like pollution , land transfers , urbanization all lead to grievances that have no medium through which people can have their grievances resolved , other than local protests and state repression , " he explained			2
but the government is apparently trying to address those issues			0
to meet the challenge of governance , @entity1 has been advocating " rule by law " instead of " rule by man			2
" to better manage rural affairs and address the farmers ' day - to - day concerns , @entity1 has been experimenting with direct village elections			1
when successful , the system allows many grievances to get addressed on the grassroots level			0
still , citizens complain about a slew of socio - economic concerns , among them inflation , jobs , housing , education and affordable health care			0
the gap between rich and poor remains the country 's biggest fault line			0
many have compared the protests in @entity173 's @entity172 to those in @entity0 's @entity76 in 1989			0
@entity1 today shares many of @entity176 's problems -- income inequality and corruption among them -- but analysts say the @entity1 leadership is in little danger of becoming the next failed regime			2
the @entity1 people themselves do n't appear to have an appetite for revolution			1
" i think most @entity1 do feel that things are going pretty well in @entity1 , economically at least to date , " said @entity187 , director of @entity188 on @entity189			2
" obviously there are some dissatisfied elements , but i do n't think that there 's the same level of cause for a populist uprising			0
" the @entity1 economic reform has trickled down to benefit the majority of the population , analysts said , while the @entity104 's grip on military , state media and the internet is a lot tighter and more sophisticated			1
in the @entity7 , the poor and the disenfranchised have risen up in revolt			2
in @entity1 , many of those same people have risen from poverty			1
analysts say continuing to spread the wealth remains one of @entity1 's biggest challenges .			2
