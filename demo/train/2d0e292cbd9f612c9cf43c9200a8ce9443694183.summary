-- in 1940 , @entity2 's most popular comedian made a movie that subjected a world leader to ruthless parody , turning a brutal despot into a figure of fun			1
at the time , @entity9 was consolidating his hold over @entity11 ; the full monstrousness of @entity14 atrocities were still to be revealed , and the @entity15 was not yet at war with his regime			0
but the film had been controversial from the start			0
two years earlier , @entity21 officials raised questions about it and the secretary of the @entity25 wrote to his @entity15 counterpart saying it could violate a rule against depicting a living person on screen without his consent			0
of course , " dictator " went on to become @entity33 's biggest commercial success , and is today regularly listed among the greatest films in @entity2 history			2
one wonders what would have become of " @entity38 " today , given @entity40 's decision wednesday to respond to threats from anonymous hackers by yanking the raunchy @entity44 satire " @entity45 " with @entity46 and @entity47 from theatrical release			1
granted , it 's unlikely that " the interview " is in the same league as @entity33 's magnum opus -- given that the film 's comedy rests on subtle , nuanced plot elements such as @entity46 being forced to hide objects in his anus , i 'm not even sure it 's playing the same sport			2
and @entity40 was compelled to pull the film after being subjected to debilitating leaks that have cost it hundreds of millions in lost time and business , and confronted with a new set of cyberterrorist intimidations that included a promise of " 9/11 - style violence " -- threats that ultimately led a half - dozen of the biggest theater chains in the @entity15 to announce that they would refuse to show " @entity45 " if @entity40 chose to distribute it			1
@entity40 's surrender is more than just a humiliating black eye for one of the world 's largest entertainment companies -- more , even , than the first notes of a dirge for the studio and its beleaguered leadership			1
it opens a new and insidious chapter in artistic censorship that raises the question of whether any work that lampoons or derides a powerful public figure or institution can now be made in today 's entertainment industry			2
art ( and for this argument 's purposes , let 's include " @entity45 " in the category of " art " ) has always been deeply intertwined with politics			1
many of the greatest works in history would never have been created without the patronage of powerful world leaders and institutions , from kings and queens to religious faiths to merchant princelings			0
and of course , the flipside of the coin of patronage has always been repression : the @entity112 of @entity114 emperor @entity113 ; @entity9 's purging of " degenerate " art ; @entity118 's @entity117 ; more recently , the death threats and vandalizations that have accompanied displays of @entity123 's " @entity122 , " a photo of a crucifix immersed in urine ; the fatwa that sent @entity128 into hiding for writing his literary fantasy " @entity130 " ; the murder of filmmaker @entity132 for making the documentary " submission , " which questioned the treatment of women under @entity136 ; and the controversies over the cartoon depiction of the @entity139 in the @entity141 newspaper @entity140 and on @entity143 's " @entity142			2
" @entity15 's recent midterm elections were affected by the question of art 's intersection with politics : the @entity150 riots that served as the backdrop for a militant assault that killed several @entity15 diplomatic officials , including @entity154 , the @entity15 ambassador to @entity155 , were initially claimed to have been part of a global series of protests after the @entity160 release of an amateurish @entity162 film called " @entity163			0
" what @entity40 's capitulation shows , however , is that in our postmodern era , shutting down the arts no longer requires jackbooted soldiers , raging mobs -- or even manifest physical danger			1
it does n't matter if @entity44 was originally behind the @entity40 hack ; even if it was , it 's certainly unlikely that the vague threats to public safety in the more recent warnings could ever have been carried out			1
but after @entity40 's decision , the mere threat of attack by shadowy digital forces may now be enough to forestall interest in depicting " controversial " public figures -- or subjects			1
and this chill wo n't be limited to political leaders			0
after all , any institution or individual can buy a black - hat hacker 's time ; a single individual with enough time and skills can wreak unprecedented havoc on a multibillion - dollar company , and some of the most brilliant inhabitants of the digital dark side do their dirty deeds for nothing but the promise of " lulz			0
" so the question remains : could " @entity38 " be made today ? could " @entity202 : @entity203 " ? what about @entity206 's forthcoming documentary on @entity207 , " @entity208 " ? the repercussions from @entity40 's junking of " the interview " are already being seen : @entity212 and @entity213 were working on a @entity215 thriller set in @entity44 that was ready to begin shooting in march			1
on wednesday , they quietly killed the project			0
@entity40 could have stood its ground and decided to release the film , even if only in a single theater			2
it could have chosen to distribute it globally via on - demand streaming , and probably would have made hundreds of millions from curiosity - seekers and those who want to send a message against censorship			0
it might have even chosen to fight fire with fire , broadly releasing the film to pirate sites and illicit - sharing platforms as an upraised middle finger to those who tried to suppress it -- the money has already been spent on it , after all , and an act of bravura of that caliber might even have brought @entity40 a patina of cool			2
instead , the dominoes will continue to fall			0
@entity40 has given saboteurs a virtual veto over its productions , and @entity2 seems likely to follow suit			1
in short , at least in this battle , the terrorists have won .			0

after anonymous threats , movie *exhibitors* and @entity40 *canceled* " @entity45 "
@entity250 says it 's a complete surrender and has grave *implications* for media
he says a precedent is now set for other saboteurs to kill free expression
