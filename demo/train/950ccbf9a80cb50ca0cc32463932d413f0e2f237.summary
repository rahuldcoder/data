editor 's note : @entity2 is @entity3 at @entity4 and master of @entity6			1
he is the author of " @entity7 : the @entity8 , " " @entity9 and the @entity10 " and " @entity10 : the @entity11 , 1933 -- 1940			1
" @entity12 says @entity14 's administration could learn lessons from the @entity10			1
@entity4 , @entity16 ( @entity17 ) -- students here in @entity4 watched in horror in september 2005 as they saw lines of desperate people snaked round the convention center and the @entity23 in @entity24 after @entity25			1
in the past couple of months , they watched with admiration the lines outside polling stations both on @entity30 and in the early voting states			2
they found it difficult to imagine that voters in @entity35 would be prepared to queue for hours to vote			1
no @entity37 election in recent history has aroused such interest in @entity35 among old and young alike			1
partly , this is the result of the compelling drama of the long drawn - out primary battles , partly the result of the feeling that , whichever candidate was elected , there would be an end to the " arrogant unilateralism " ( @entity50 's phrase in @entity4 in 2002 ) of @entity52 foreign policy			1
partly , of course , it was the powerful narrative of an @entity37 running for the @entity56			0
each august i teach 35 american high school teachers about the civil rights movement for the @entity60 in the far - removed historic buildings of @entity6			0
this year they reported their students were unprecedentedly enthusiastic about both @entity14 and the political process			1
i expressed deep skepticism that an @entity37 - @entity37 candidate could win a southern state			0
they had more faith in southern voters and they were right and i was wrong			0
as i have told @entity35 audiences , it was a stunning achievement for an @entity37 - @entity37 candidate to carry @entity73 for the @entity74 when three white southerners -- @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 -- failed to do so			1
now that president - elect @entity14 is preparing to take office , i was interested to hear he is reading about president @entity80 's first 100 days in office			1
the situations in 1933 and 2009 do have similarities			0
in both cases , there is a discredited outgoing administration , a financial crisis , a lame - duck @entity89 which finds it difficult to act , a new president who is a talented communicator and has a popular election victory and large congressional majorities			1
but 1933 was also very different from the situation that will face @entity14 in january			1
the @entity96 had been going on for four years			0
between a quarter and a third of the industrial workforce was out of work			0
farmers , who were a third of the workforce then , were desperate			0
there were none of the stabilizers that exist now to protect ordinary @entity52 : no bank deposit insurance , no social security and the welfare and relief resources of private charities and local and state governments were exhausted			1
the day @entity7 took office , the banks in @entity113 and @entity114 closed			1
the whole @entity52 banking system ground to a halt			1
the result was that @entity89 was desperate for bold leadership			0
constituents let their representatives know that they expected them to support the president as if the country was at war			0
when @entity7 proclaimed a national bank holiday and worked to reopen the banks , @entity125 and @entity74 supported him			1
the @entity56 passed the banking bill -- and they only had one copy of it -- in 43 minutes			0
when @entity80 addressed the nation on sunday , march 12 , it was a tremendous gamble			2
he told @entity52 it was safer to put their money back in the banks reopening the next day than to hide it under the mattress			2
they believed him and the next day the money flowed back into the banks that had been allowed to open			0
there was no @entity140 : if people had continued taking money out , absolute disaster would have followed			0
despite four months to prepare -- @entity7 was the last president to be inaugurated in march -- @entity80 had no great template to put into effect when he took office			1
he used the banking proposals of holdover @entity125 officials at the @entity150 and the @entity151			0
he proposed the @entity152 only after @entity89 threatened to pass share - the - work legislation that would have mandated a maximum 30 - hour work week			0
he only brought @entity155 to @entity156 to set up a national relief program after existing appropriations relief allocation to the states ran out			0
he did not favor bank deposit insurance but accepted it			0
he accepted large public works spending reluctantly			0
@entity7 had a penchant for quick - fix solutions for the economy like currency tinkering			2
but he also launched the @entity171 and the @entity172 , crop control programs for farmers , and regulation of the stock market and the banks , and he underwrote the refinancing of mortgage debt on a long - term basis			0
are there lessons for president - elect @entity14 ? perhaps there are several			2
first , in the @entity10 's industrial recovery programs , a provision for loans to businesses disappeared			2
as a result there was no mechanism for creating extra jobs in the private sector			0
perhaps @entity14 should preserve jobs in the economy by bailing out the auto industry			2
second , infrastructure investment works , as the @entity10 's public works programs showed in highways , education , cheap electrical power and flood control			2
third , the first 100 days can be a window of opportunity to pass reforms that will not be possible later on , but complex structural changes -- like @entity7 's introduction of social security -- may have to wait			1
for @entity14 , health care reform may be one of those issues that has to wait			2
and finally , responding to an economic crisis requires the ability to improvise , to work across the aisle and to take measures that might at first be at odds with your original plans			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity12 .			2

@entity12 : @entity35 students impressed that @entity52 stood in lines to vote
@entity14 is reading about @entity80 's first 100 days
@entity2 says there are *parallels* today to what @entity7 faced in 1930s
*badger* : handling a financial crisis takes ability to improvise and *rethink* plans
