for actor @entity0 , who is starring in a movie adaptation of @entity3 's heralded and popular novel " @entity8 , " statements against same - sex marriage by the science - fiction author " are not an issue for me			1
" at a @entity11 news conference on thursday , @entity9 responded to concerns that @entity3 's comments have overshadowed the production of the movie			1
the author of the 1985 novel professed his opposition to same - sex marriage in 2009 when he joined he board of the @entity21 , which opposes same - sex unions			1
although @entity3 released a statement declaring the same - sex marriage issue " moot " after last month 's @entity27 ruling striking down a key part of the @entity29 , the film has continued to be plagued by controversy			1
@entity0 told reporters that while he fundamentally disagrees with the author 's stance , the film stands separate from the issue			1
" i think none of mr. @entity3 's concerns regarding the issues of gay marriage are part of the thematics of this film , " @entity0 said			1
" he has written something that i think is of value to us all concerning moral responsibility			0
i think his views outside of those that we deal with in this film are not an issue for me to deal with and something i have really no opinion on			2
comic - con : what we ca n't wait to see " i am aware of his statements admitting that the question of gay marriage is a battle that he lost and he admits that he lost it			1
i think we all know that we 've all won			0
and i think that 's the end of the story			0
" for @entity9 , " @entity8 " addresses its own social and political concerns			2
the film is set in the future , depicting a child military trained by the government to wage interplanetary war			2
@entity9 plays col. @entity73 , a military commander who trains the titular character of @entity75 , played by @entity76			0
even though the movie is set in a science fiction universe , @entity0 said he has found many contemporary comparisons to the moral concerns of the story			2
" this movie is very prescient , and i think the novel was prescient in recognizing something that we now have as a reality in our lives , which is the ability to wage war at a distance , " @entity0 said			2
" so the morality of that military commander and the military command structure , the morality of a society which raises a military and wages war are the moral concerns of this film and something we are wrestling with daily			0
" the issue of interplanetary warfare is the science fiction aspect of it , but what gives it such emotional tone and reality is that these are the concerns of our everyday lives			0
" drone warfare and the capacity that we have technologically is one part of the moral package			0
the other is the use of young people in the business of war , which has always historically been the case			0
our youngest and fittest of our cultures have always been the ones who are first in line for warfare			0
" share your mini-interviews from @entity11 @entity0 , who noted that it was particularly compelling to work with " talented young actors " such as @entity76 and @entity131 , as well as sir @entity132 , was also asked whether he found any comparison between @entity134 and his famed " @entity136 " character , @entity135			1
" @entity73 is a very complex character that 's charged with an awesome responsibility , " @entity0 said			1
" the complex moral issues are part of @entity73 's story			0
@entity8 does n't really face so much the issues of morality until the end of the film until he knows what 's happened to him			1
" @entity73 is aware of his moral responsibilities all through his part of the story			0
i was just delighted to be involved in a film of such high ambition with such talented people			0
i think @entity73 is a much more complex character than @entity135 , which does n't mean that i regret @entity135			1
" " @entity8 " is scheduled to be released in theaters on november 1			2
@entity156 , the film 's studio , released a new viral clip from the film wednesday in honor of its presence at @entity11 , and they also premiered a trailer for the film at the fan panel that followed the news conference .			1
