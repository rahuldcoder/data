-- the @entity1 is heading back to the airwaves with yet another round of ads aimed at fighting gun - control initiatives circulating in @entity6			1
the advocacy group announced earlier this week that its ceo , @entity8 , would unveil the new ad campaign saturday night from @entity10 during a speech at the @entity12 and @entity13			0
in the same statement saying @entity8 would showcase new ads , the @entity1 said he would also " confront the real consequences of so - called ' universal background checks			1
' " as it turned out , @entity8 did not mention any new advertising in his remarks			0
but he did -- as he has done passionately in the past -- rail against president @entity23 and other @entity24 and the background checks that he said are " at the very heart of their anti-gun agenda			1
" " this so - called universal background check that you 're hearing about all over the media ... is aimed at one thing : it 's aimed at registering your guns , " @entity8 claimed			1
" and when another tragic opportunity presents itself , that registry will be used to confiscate your guns			0
" the ads are the @entity1 's latest salvo in the gun debate , attempting to influence the public -- and , thus , lawmakers -- to challenge a fresh gun - control push , one that the @entity1 ceo called " the single most devastating attack on the @entity44 that this country has ever seen			1
" the influential lobbying group has been vocal since @entity23 called for action in the days after the mass shooting at an elementary school in @entity50 , @entity51 , that left 20 students and six adults dead			0
afterward , @entity1 leaders said they would work with local officials to get more qualified armed guards in schools , while sharply resisting proposals to ban assault weapons , limit the size of gun magazines and to expand the system of background checks for firearms purchases			2
the @entity1 efforts include advertisements such as the one , broadcast in mid-january , that described @entity23 as an " elitist hypocrite " because his two daughters are protected while at school by armed federal agents and yet he is " skeptical " about having armed personnel at all schools			0
the @entity75 blasted that ad , as did members of both political parties , for injecting the president 's children into the debate ( and not acknowledging they may face different threats than other @entity84 schoolchildren )			2
but @entity1 president @entity85 defended the spot on @entity0 , saying , " what we 're talking about is folks who have protections for their own children , ... then pooh - pooh the idea that the average @entity84 's children should have the same sort of protection			2
" the gun rights organization also posted a web video that month asserting @entity23 's attempts to enact gun control laws would result in the " confiscation " of people 's firearms			1
more recently , the @entity1 ran ads in newspapers in five states -- @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 -- with the headline : " will @entity23 's gun control proposals work ? his own experts say ' no. ' " @entity24 incumbent senators in three of those states are facing tough reelection fights , another is retiring and in the fifth , @entity109 , moderate @entity119 sen. @entity119 is up for reelection next year			1
that ad buy , which also includes regional publications and online commercials , will cost the @entity1 about $ 350,000 , a source familiar with it told @entity0			0
this follows the spending of about $ 100,000 to air a web video on various news sites in @entity130 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity131 , @entity132 and the @entity6			0
the @entity1 has been successful in the past in thwarting gun - control legislation by building support on the grass - roots level , and that is where the group is focusing much of its efforts now			2
still , the organization has a challenge , given the horrific nature of the @entity50 massacre -- coming on the heels of several other mass shootings -- and the high priority that @entity23 is placing on gun control			0
it also has competition in terms of ads , with groups such as @entity154 and @entity155 taking to newspapers and the airwaves themselves to push for stricter gun control measures .			1

@entity1 promises to release new ads , criticize ' so - called universal background checks '
group has actively opposed gun control measures backed by president @entity23
one past ad questions why @entity23 's children have armed security , other students do not
other groups have released their own ads , calling for stricter gun control measures
