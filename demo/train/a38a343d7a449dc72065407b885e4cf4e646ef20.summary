-- one hot summer morning in @entity3 , @entity4 , i came across a group of young men who had been snatched from their classrooms by paramilitary groups and turned into child soldiers			1
they had been drugged and forced to rape , torture and kill people			1
at the end of our talk , they said : " we just want to go back to school			2
" the oldest was 16			2
educating these youths meant more than imparting knowledge			0
information alone would n't satisfy the thirst of these war victims - turned perpetrators			0
their faith in education was immense			1
they thought it would bring meaning to their lives			1
they wanted to understand what humans are made of , they wanted ethics and wisdom and skills to master acceptance or apply compassion			0
in short , they wanted their dignity back			0
and besides crucial economic , peace and health factors , this is what education is all about			1
education is the most efficient weapon with which to address the world 's most pressing problems			1
and as a new analysis released by @entity55 's @entity53 demonstrates , education 's transformative power knows no boundaries			1
investing in education , especially for girls , result in substantial benefits for their health and productivity			1
it also increases democratic participation and empowers women , according to the @entity55 report , " @entity68			1
" the research reveals that if all women had a primary education , child marriages and child mortality could fall by a sixth and maternal deaths by two - thirds			1
with a visceral instinct to protect their children from harm , mothers work miracles every day to provide their children with education			1
one day in @entity83 , a woman who was dying from @entity85 because of an unfaithful husband , told her eldest daughter that she had made her choice			0
rather than buy medicine to save her own life ( this was before anti-retroviral drugs were widely available and affordable ) , she would spend her money to send her daughter to school			1
she asked her child to become a doctor and help save her people from this devastating disease			1
@entity100 , whom i met after her mother had passed away , indeed became a doctor			0
she created the first alliance of @entity83 health workers to fight @entity106 in a country where professionals tend to leave in droves and practice abroad for economic reasons			0
@entity100 went on to study at @entity111 before returning to the war - torn rural area of northern @entity83 , where for the longest time she was one of two doctors serving a population of 300,000			0
she did n't only study medicine ; at 35 , she 's also an expert in advocacy and human rights			1
there are countless mothers like @entity100 's out there , and they are everywhere -- mothers for whom education does n't merely prepare one for life , education is life			1
yet 57 million children are out of school			0
this means we are yet to make free and compulsory education a priority			1
the world leaders who are about to meet at the @entity135 should do everything in their power to meet this goal now and look at this effort as the safest investment into our common future			2
beyond all the conflicts tearing the world apart , it is the human aspiration to learn and grow that might hold us together			2
education is our guiding hope			2
you ca n't change your life if you do n't know how			2
education saves lives , averts hunger , promotes tolerance and gives purpose			1
people overcome impossible odds thanks to education			1
for example , if all women had secondary school , they would know how to feed their children			2
they would know the hygiene rules that they should follow			0
and they would have a stronger voice in the home to ensure proper care			0
this change would save more than 12 million children from being stunted -- a sign of early childhood malnutrition			0
learning gives us the means to lead meaningful lives and a proper education will awaken the desire to benefit others			1
the difference between a primary and secondary education can improve tolerance towards people of another race by 50 % , according to the @entity55 report			1
arguing that we should all get better educated to become better people does n't mean that the need for basic education is n't dire			1
recently , on @entity191 , i published an astonishing story brought to me by journalist @entity193 and her colleague , photographer @entity195 , about the practice of trokosi in rural @entity198			0
the trokosi practice calls for virgin girls to be sent to the shrines of fetish gods to pay for crimes committed by one of their relatives			0
they become living sacrifices , protecting their families from the gods ' wrath			2
some stay at the shrines for a few years ; others for life			2
the young girls become slaves to the priest			0
they live with a rope tied around their neck , fighting hunger and working from dawn to dusk			0
the @entity198 government outlawed the practice in 1998 and over the years about 3,000 of the trokosi slaves have been liberated , but many more have been brought to more remote shrines			0
a young woman named @entity230 tried to defend herself but learned the hard way that the law was n't enough to protect her			0
she had been allowed to go to school while preparing to take her final initiation at @entity236 shrine in @entity238 district			0
there , she learned that the practice was a violation of human rights			0
she reported her initiation to the police and took her parents to court -- something no one had dared to do before			0
but her parents refused to attend the hearing and the police did n't force them , so the case was thrown out of court and @entity230 became a slave			0
as she pursued her investigation , interviewing priests and families , @entity193 met a priest who told her : " we just heard that trokosi was against the law and that women were human beings and needed to be treated as equal			2
we had n't ever heard before that women needed to be treated as equal			2
" this is how deep the need to educate is			0
but there is a school now in the area , and the priest admits that education will succeed in eradicating slavery even where the law has failed			2
" the new generations are learning new things , reading about the world			1
i do n't think they will be interested in sitting behind the shrine wearing this hat of mine , " he said			0
@entity280 thought that an uneducated man was as good as dead			0
@entity100 's mother chose her daughter 's education over her own life			1
@entity286 , the priest in @entity198 , reluctantly admitted the defeat of tradition by education			2
in all these cases , the conclusion remains the same			0
it is education that makes life worth living and the best i can wish to anyone is to never stop learning			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity301 .			1

@entity55 releases a report that shows education can radically transform people 's lives
@entity301 : education is the most efficient weapon to combat world 's pressing problems
she says if all women had a primary education , child mortality could fall by a sixth
@entity301 : it is education that makes life worth living ; we should all never stop learning
