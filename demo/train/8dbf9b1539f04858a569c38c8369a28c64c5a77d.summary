-- three hundred and forty			2
at the @entity2 visitors can climb into ancient cliff dwellings used by @entity4			1
that 's how many steps and ladder rungs we climb to @entity2 ( http://www.nps.gov/band / ) , to crowd into its ancient ( dating back to before 1300 ) cliff dwellings about 50 miles northwest of @entity12 , @entity13			1
even the kids are impressed that @entity16 families lived here before @entity17 arrived , even before the @entity18 stepped foot on @entity20			2
we look at the crumbling adobe and try to imagine apartment - type dwellings that stretched more than three stories : we crouch inside the ceremonial @entity24 where the ancient people gathered to teach the children , weave , congregate and discuss the affairs of the day			2
these unique sites -- @entity2 certainly is n't the only one -- and spectacular desert landscape make @entity13 a terrific family destination winter or summer , and one that will win kudos from all ages			1
where else can you ski one day -- in @entity36 or outside of @entity12 , gallery hop or take a cooking lesson the next , shop or tour museums till you drop and gain a new perspective on @entity4 ? @entity13 is home to 22 sovereign @entity4 nations , including the @entity44 , two @entity45 and 19 @entity46			1
the @entity47 ( http://www.skycity.com / ) , which sits on a 367 - foot - high sandstone rock , is considered the oldest inhabited village in the @entity50			1
the @entity51 in @entity52 can help you get started ( www.indianpueblo.com )			2
you can even stay on a @entity47 -- the deluxe @entity55 ( http://www.tamaya.hyatt.com ) , owned by the @entity56 and managed by @entity55 , offers holiday packages			1
the 350 - room resort , halfway between @entity52 and @entity12 , sits on 500 sprawling acres of a 73,000 - acre reservation and is one of the largest resorts ever built on @entity4 land			1
and you ca n't beat the @entity64 on the horizon for scenery			2
great pains have been taken to respect the ancient spirits at the resort			0
one of the pools is built in a circle , replicating the ceremonial @entity24 that have been an integral part of @entity47 life for centuries			1
spa treatments are designed to use products that are indigenous to the area ( how about a hydrating treatment using desert seaweed or an exfoliation treatment with @entity81 flour ? ) the signature @entity83 restaurant serves dishes from the region			0
the profits go back to the @entity47 and fund everything from college scholarships to senior centers			1
sure you can hang out by the pool , opt for the spa , or play golf here , but horseback riding through the pueblo 's backcountry to see petroglyphs , making adobe bricks , drums or pottery or visiting the cultural center and museum devoted to the history , culture and art of the @entity56 make this a different experience			0
" all of these activities appealed to us , " said @entity108 , who is from suburban @entity109 and was busy making bricks one morning with his two daughters , @entity112 , 9 , and @entity113 , 7			2
@entity13 , i think , as i make my way down the ladder at @entity2 and later , watch my daughters knead the dough for @entity47 bread at the @entity122 , under the watchful eye of a member of the @entity56 , can be a terrific winter vacation bet for families whose members are not all equally enthusiastic about spending their entire vacation on the slopes			1
especially at holiday time when there are traditional dances at @entity132 @entity46 and a variety of celebrations in @entity12 and around @entity13 ( @entity135 , www.nmtourism.org )			1
@entity136 ( www.santafemountainadventures.com ) can help plan a unique sojourn , organizing family activities from touring @entity2 to geocaching , an outdoor treasure - hunting game , to snowshoeing , cooking and pottery making			1
" you get so much more out of a visit to a place like this when you 're with a guide , " offers @entity143 , whose family joined us touring @entity2 with @entity136 guides @entity146 , a college professor , and @entity148 , an artist and guide			1
as we climb ladders and steps , courtesy of the @entity158 , @entity146 points out the foot holes in the volcanic rock that the ancient peoples used			0
we wonder what it was like to live in this community so long ago when 30 was considered old , when children were married as soon as they reached puberty and when everything was about the community , not individuals			0
they raised corn , ( the @entity47 people have some 50 recipes to prepare corn ) squash and beans			1
the elevation here is 7,000 feet , but it does n't seem to bother us			0
where we hike at @entity2 , there are as many as 50 dwellings in one section -- and the ground floor does n't have any doors or windows			1
the people who lived here climbed up to the roof and then climbed down into the room , which they probably did to protect their homes			0
no one , @entity146 explains , really knows why the ancient @entity47 people decided to leave -- whether it was drought , or illness or an impulse to move to another @entity197 ; @entity203 gestures out to the desert landscape , " you could n't have walked a meter in any direction without running into pueblo remains			2
" as we prepared to fly home , all i could think about were those ancient families ( did their kids drive them crazy sometimes too ? ) and all those @entity46 i would have liked to visit , the cooking classes i did n't have time to schedule , the @entity12 galleries and museums we missed , ( check out the @entity216 and @entity217 's ( www.eldoradohotel.com ) @entity215 package , valid now through jan. 31 , 2008			1
starting at $ 199 per night , double occupancy , it includes daily breakfast in the hotel 's @entity220 or via room service			0
) , and the hikes we did n't attempt			0
" we did something different every day ! " my husband said			0
more important , no one complained about what we did or where we were going			0
we ate great food , especially the guacamole at @entity232 ( www.elpinto.com ) outside of @entity52 , which was made right in front of us			0
not that our @entity13 sojourn was perfect			2
traveling with kids -- no matter what their ages -- never is , even in the most spectacular locales			0
what matters , of course , is the chance to explore a new place -- a new culture -- together			0
pass the guacamole , please			0
