-- the recent spate of stories about the rev. @entity4 's history as an informant for the @entity6 do n't exactly qualify as breaking news : solid newspaper reports at least a quarter century old , detailing @entity4 's maneuvers at the treacherous intersection of federal agents , violent gangsters , and shady music industry operators			1
in his autobiography , @entity4 himself writes about the days in the late 1980s when he wore a wire and collected data on criminals for the feds			1
but the publication of @entity6 memos naming @entity4 , ( aka @entity22 # 7 ) seems jarring because of how far @entity4 has traveled into the political mainstream			1
back in the 1980s , he was a street agitator with a relentless hunger for media attention			0
today he hosts a top - rated national television show and a three - hour radio talk show that airs in dozens of markets nationwide			0
the @entity4 of the 1980s registered on the political radar of @entity31 as a nuisance , dismissively dubbed " @entity34 " by then - mayor @entity33			1
this week , mayor @entity35 will speak on the opening day of @entity4 's annual conference , and the keynote address will be delivered by president @entity39 , who regularly gives @entity4 exclusive interviews and private visits to the @entity42			1
that 's why @entity4 took offense to the disparaging tabloid headlines referring to him as " @entity46 " and as a snitch			2
" i was not , and am not , a rat because i was not with the rats			0
i 'm a cat , " @entity4 told a group of reporters at a news conference , chastising reporters for suggesting that his efforts to help nab criminals were motivated by such things as avoiding prosecution , rather than a genuine civic effort to help law enforcement officials			1
whatever @entity4 's reasons , he did society a favor by helping to expose the outright criminality that was prevalent in the music industry			2
for decades , crooks had a stranglehold on popular music , according to " @entity69 , " @entity71 's 1990 , eye - opening book about the hoodlums , artists and executives who routinely resorted to blackmail , extortion , payola and outright violence as business tools			0
among the tales picked up on @entity4 's wire was information on @entity83 , a legend in the music business who owned nightspots , including @entity88 , in @entity89 , and the rights to scores of hit songs			2
@entity83 , a roughneck from the @entity94 , described himself as a boyhood friend of @entity96 ( @entity97 , who eventually rose to become boss of the @entity100 crime family			0
@entity83 had deep financial ties to members of the organization , selling part of one of his record companies to a gangster named @entity108 , who was later shot to death in 1972 , according to the @entity110			0
@entity83 also reportedly set up a friend and enforcer named @entity113 with his own record label , called @entity115 , which made records for soul singers			0
@entity113 was found murdered in a @entity119 hotel room in 1980			0
and according to @entity4 's secret recordings , @entity83 was in up to his neck with @entity97 and the @entity123 organization financially , using his legitimate businesses to help the mobsters acquire property and -- allegedly -- move heroin			2
@entity83 was eventually sentenced to 10 years in prison for conspiracy to commit extortion			0
he 'd arranged the severe beating of a record industry associate who owed money , but would n't pay			0
@entity83 died of cancer shortly before he was due to report to prison			0
these were the types of men @entity4 was dealing with in the 1980s as he tried to work with independent black music promoters trying to break into the business			1
having served for a decade as road manager for singer @entity141 , @entity4 knew the industry gangers were not to be trifled with			2
when @entity144 associates threatened to kill @entity4 for challenging their stranglehold on music , @entity4 says , he ran straight to the @entity6 , who in turn asked him to wear a wire and help gather evidence against the mobsters			1
the strategy seems to have worked : many of the @entity123 hoods that @entity4 spoke to or heard about ended up behind bars , including @entity97 , who died in prison in 2005			2
the good reverend , meanwhile , moved further into mainstream grassroots politics and maintains to this day that he did nothing wrong			0
@entity4 , in fact , makes the valid point that many black communities suffer high crime rates because of a destructive " stop snitching " attitude of non-cooperation with police -- and that his wearing a wire for the @entity6 represents a move in a more positive direction			1
when confronted with death threats from organized crime , the logical action for law - abiding citizens is to report the problem to the authorities and help bring the criminals to justice			1
that is what @entity4 did , and you do n't have to like his politics to conclude that , in this case , he made the best of a scary situation .			1

@entity187 : @entity4 under new *criticism* for informing on criminals for @entity6 in 1980s
louis : this old news shows how far @entity4 has come into political mainstream
he says @entity4 was threatened by organized crime members
louis : you do n't have to like his politics to see he did what a law - abiding citizen should do
