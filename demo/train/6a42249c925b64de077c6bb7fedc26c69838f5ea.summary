like @entity10 announced last month , @entity1 wants to create its own streaming video programs , however , according to the @entity8 sources , the company will create low - cost programming designed specifically for the web and @entity4 , and support the shows with advertising			1
the sources said this will be a " major overhaul " to @entity4 , which already has a lucrative advertising system in place			1
it was unclear when @entity1 would begin spending the money to create the new programs , but the source said that @entity1 has visited top @entity26 talent agencies in search of ideas , and will probably end up making deals with production companies and directors to produce the content			1
