the @entity4 action is afoot , with designers showcasing their spring 2015 collections this week and next , before heading overseas to @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9			1
see all of @entity11 's @entity4 coverage what will be sent down the runways , and ultimately into consumers ' closets ? two fashion forecasters from @entity17 , the official trend sponsor for the sleek affair , weigh in with their predictions			1
a strut down memory lane as the fashion world looks to spring , designers will be looking back -- particularly to the 1970s -- for inspiration , according to @entity17 's head of catwalk , @entity26			1
if the prospect of a " @entity30 " renaissance seems less than groovy , @entity26 assures the retro influence will be subdued			2
@entity32 comfy , caftan chic " the idea is to get back into yesteryear but add a contemporary twist with a fresh modern appeal , " @entity26 says			0
pants will take up a slight flare , and just as @entity40 notably catapulted menswear into the spotlight in 1977 's " @entity43 , " so will the fashion - forward in spring 2015			1
@entity26 says one of the big themes will be a " fuss - free approach of androgyny " : think sleek , sophisticated jumpsuits and / or tailored jackets paired with relaxed wide - leg trousers			1
in a similar vein , @entity52 , @entity17 's senior womenswear editor , forecasts that the basic white dress shirt , a wardrobe staple , will be transformed with more dramatic side vents and cuffs , origami folding , embellishments and the like			0
@entity60 also expects a sampling of tent dresses , sometimes referred to as trapeze dresses , to hit the catwalks			0
( if the garment were laid flat on a surface , its silhouette would gradually flare out from the shoulders and resemble the shape of a tent -- hence the name			0
) both forecasters anticipate a continuation of longer hemlines with midi skirts ( skirts that fall midcalf ) , as well as ankle - length wrap versions , with their waistlines falling at the natural waist versus the hip			1
while hemlines are lower , @entity26 says there certainly will be no shortage of shorts , particularly of the @entity87 variety			0
straddling that line is one of the most talked - about trends for spring : culottes , a wide - leg , airy , not - quite - shorts , not - quite - pants silhouette			1
keeping it cool @entity95 and pastels go together like april showers and may flowers			0
for 2015 , those pastel tones will be washed out and desaturated			2
in keeping with that , there will also be a " core neutral story , " @entity60 says , with shades of tan , taupe , gray , white and black			0
@entity26 expects collections will also be brimming with different shades of purple , particularly lilac			2
as for patterns , both predict there will be a bouquet of hand - painted florals , including of the @entity117 theme			1
" it 's not going to scream ' @entity117 , ' it 's going to be more sophisticated and you 're going to realize it 's a hibiscus flower after , " @entity60 says .			0

fashion forecasters predict spring collections will channel the 1970s
culottes , a wide - leg , cropped and airy style of pants , will be a key piece
