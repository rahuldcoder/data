-- president @entity1 and @entity2 battled over @entity3 and energy policy tuesday as the november election campaign reached out to battleground states crucial to both sides ' chances for victory			1
in an escalating struggle to seize the advantage on the contentious @entity3 issue , the @entity2 campaign counterpunched with a new ad accusing @entity1 of cutting more than $ 700 billion from the government - run health care plan for senior citizens			1
@entity2 made the same claim at two @entity20 campaign appearances , three days after his selection of @entity23 chairman @entity22 brought the issue to the forefront of the campaign spotlight			1
@entity22 is best - known for a conservative budget plan passed by the @entity27 that includes reforms to partially privatize @entity3 , which @entity29 say will kill the popular entitlement program			0
to counter consistent @entity29 attacks in recent days against @entity22 's @entity3 proposals , the new @entity2 ad sought to turn the tables by contending the money senior citizens have paid into @entity3 for years will instead fund @entity1 's 2010 health care reform bill			1
at a campaign event tuesday in @entity20 , @entity2 beat the same drum			2
follow along on the @entity0 electoral map " when he ran for office he said he 'd protect @entity3 , but did you know that he has taken $ 716 billion out of the @entity3 trust fund -- he 's raided that trust fund -- and you know what he did with it ? " @entity2 said of @entity1			1
" he 's used it to pay for @entity49 -- a risky , unproven , federal government takeover of health care -- and if i 'm president of the @entity54 we 're putting the $ 716 billion back			0
" a july 24 @entity57 report said that repealing the health care law , as called for by @entity2 and @entity22 , would increase spending on @entity3 by $ 716 billion through 2022			2
at the same time , the @entity57 letter said keeping @entity49 in place would not mean a $ 716 billion decrease in @entity3 spending as claimed by @entity2 and his ad			1
the @entity1 campaign called @entity2 's claim " dishonest and " hypocritical			1
" " the savings his ad attacks do not cut a single guaranteed @entity3 benefit , and @entity2 embraced the very same savings when he promised he 'd sign @entity22 's budget , " said @entity1 campaign spokeswoman @entity66			1
@entity72 , @entity1 's senior campaign adviser , told @entity0 earlier tuesday that @entity3 reforms in the president 's health care law " took away subsidies , unwarranted subsidies , to insurance companies , and he used that money to help lengthen the life of @entity3 by nearly a decade			1
" dueling appearances by the presidential contenders and their running mates hit states considered up for grabs in november -- @entity85 , @entity20 , @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88			2
standing in front of helmeted @entity20 coal workers , @entity2 promised @entity54 energy independence by 2020 if he is elected to two terms , saying he will promote full development of the nation 's oil , coal and natural gas reserves			1
he accused @entity1 of opposing coal energy production as part of a policy that favors energy sources " that come from above the ground " -- such as wind and solar energy -- instead of those from below the ground			2
since taking office in 2009 , @entity1 has called for a comprehensive energy strategy that includes development of cleaner alternative sources such as wind and solar energy			2
@entity113 critics contend the administration uses environmental regulations and other means to hinder development of fossil fuel energy resources such as oil and coal			0
@entity22 's @entity121 sensibilities an asset ? " he also said you can go out and build a new coal plant if you want , but you 'll go bankrupt			0
that 's what he said , " @entity2 told the applauding crowd			2
speaking at the same time as @entity2 , @entity1 told a campaign event in @entity129 , @entity85 , that @entity2 would not support the wind energy industry developing in the state			1
" gov. @entity2 said let 's end the tax credits for wind energy production , let 's get rid of them			1
he said that new sources of energy like wind are imaginary , " @entity1 said			2
the president cited a thriving wind energy industry in the state , noting it supports nearly 7,000 @entity85 jobs			1
" if he knew what you 've been doing , he 'd know that about 20 % of @entity85 's electricity now comes from wind , powering our homes and our factories and our businesses in a way that 's clean and renewable , " @entity1 said , later calling for a halt to billions of dollars in tax subsidies to oil companies making " huge profits " and instead investing in " the new homegrown energy that 's creating jobs here in @entity85			1
" overall , though , the campaign focus remained on @entity22 and his budget plan passed by @entity162 that calls for sharp cuts in non-military spending to shrink government as well as stark reforms to the @entity3 entitlement programs that provide health care to senior citizens , the poor and the disabled			0
@entity22 's proposals include the provision that @entity3 - approved private insurers would one day compete with traditional @entity3 on an exchange			0
the intention of his plan is to remake @entity3 so that it remains financially soluble for future generations , while preserving the benefits of current seniors and those who will qualify in the next 10 years , he told @entity180 on sunday			0
@entity22 , campaigning in @entity86 , made no specific mention of his @entity3 reform plans , instead emphasizing his " regular guy " interests , such as bow - hunting , and promising to restore opportunity for those willing to work for it			0
" when i was growing up , you know when i was flipping burgers at @entity194 , when i was standing in front of that big @entity197 machine washing dishes or waiting tables , i never thought of myself as stuck in some station in life , " @entity22 told more 2,000 supporters at @entity190 in suburban @entity191			0
" i thought to myself : i 'm the @entity54 dream			0
" a contrast in @entity204 politics later tuesday , @entity22 attended an event at @entity113 bankroller @entity208 's @entity207 hotel			0
across the country , vice president @entity209 held two events in @entity88 , where he challenged the policies of @entity2 and @entity22			1
" look at what they value and look at their budget and what they are proposing , " @entity209 said at his first stop , in @entity214			0
he accused @entity2 of promising to lift regulations on big banks that would " unchain @entity223 , " adding : " he is going to put y'all back in chains			2
" at an event tuesday evening in @entity227 , @entity20 , @entity2 attacked @entity1 and his surrogates , saying they have made " wild and reckless accusations that disgrace the office of the presidency			1
" he pointed to @entity209 's remark , calling it an outrageous charge			1
" and the @entity235 sinks a little bit lower , " he said			0
" this is what an angry and desperate presidency looks like			0
" an @entity1 campaign spokeswoman said earlier the president had no problem with @entity209 's statement			1
" we find the @entity2 campaign 's outrage over the vice president 's comments today hypocritical , particularly in light of their own candidate 's stump speech questioning the president 's patriotism , " said a statement by @entity245 of the @entity1 campaign			1
@entity113 reject the @entity29 tactic to tie @entity2 to the @entity22 proposal , saying the former @entity260 governor has his own budget and tax plans that are similar to @entity22 's but also include key differences , such as protecting anyone over 55 from changes to @entity3			1
" the budget plan , the approach on @entity3 and all of that is going to be the @entity2 plan , " senior @entity2 campaign adviser @entity266 told @entity0 tuesday			2
pressed for details in a combative interview on " starting point with @entity274 , " @entity266 said @entity2 " likes the @entity275 for its guts , " but added " he has his own plan out there , which is carefully crafted to protect the seniors from 55 and up			0
" by contrast , @entity266 added , the @entity113 plans are more comprehensive and detailed than proposals by @entity1 and @entity29 that fail to seriously address the nation 's deficit - debt problem			0
the focus of the debate on @entity22 's budget plan and @entity3 means @entity29 are winning the early message war , said @entity288 of the conservative website @entity290			0
@entity2 's choice of @entity22 means the campaign , for now , " is no longer a referendum on the president , " which has been the central @entity113 strategy , said @entity288 , a @entity0 contributor			2
" it 's a choice between two visions			0
and a lot of @entity113 strategists do n't have confidence that the @entity2 campaign is able to sell their choice , " @entity288 said monday night			0
in addition , @entity288 noted , the main topic now is @entity3 and " republicans do n't necessarily win when you talk about @entity3			0
" campaign 2012 : how low can you go ? @entity0 's @entity309 , @entity310 , @entity311 , @entity312 , @entity313 and @entity314 , and @entity316 's @entity315 contributed to this report .			0
