@entity1 a court in @entity1 has thrown out an application for a 14 - year - old girl to be removed from her family after she was arrested for drawing chalk flowers on a wall at a pro-democracy protest site in @entity1			1
the girl was caught in the early hours of december 23 at a staircase -- known as the " @entity11 " -- leading to the @entity12 in the city 's @entity14 district and was detained by police for 17 hours			2
they then applied to have the girl taken into care			1
but magistrate @entity20 rejected this			0
" i can understand why the police made the application , " she told journalists outside the court monday , according to local media			0
" after reading the social worker 's report , i find that it is not necessary to grant the child protection order at this stage			0
" reports of the arrest and the care and protection order application attracted widespread criticism among protestors as such applications are usually made by the @entity39 , not the police , and are usually made in cases where a child is at risk			2
when an application for a care and protection order is made , the social welfare department is expected to produce a report assessing the needs and the care of the children or juveniles involved			2
a spokesperson from the @entity39 told @entity2 that all court cases in @entity1 are open , however a court can decide not to disclose information in cases where the identity of a minor needs to be protected			1
the spokesperson added that the department 's @entity60 would continue to monitor the case and provide the appropriate support and services to the girl and her family			0
but @entity67 , who participated in @entity1 's pro-democracy street occupations , told @entity2 earlier this month that the teen was " an innocent political prisoner " and the use of the law in this case was " obviously politically motivated			1
" @entity73 becomes canvas for ' silent protest ' in @entity1 protest support the @entity11 became a focal point for messages of support for the recent pro-democracy protests in @entity1			1
when the protests were cleared , the messages -- hundreds of post-it notes -- were removed as well			0
protesters started placing notes on the wall as a show of defiance after police used tear gas on demonstrators at the start of the protest , which led to a two - month occupation of the main road outside the @entity96			1
the wall was named after the late @entity98 star @entity97 and contained messages of support for the protests and references to his song " imagine			0
" the girl -- widely known as " chalk girl " -- told local newspaper @entity105 earlier this month that she did not regret getting involved with the protests and urged activists not to give up			1
last week , police withdrew an application for a care and protection order for a 14 - year - old boy last week			1
the boy was arrested during the police clear out of the @entity115 protest site last year			1
the court file said the boy 's parents failed to exercise proper guardianship over him			0
continued resistance a small protest camp outside the @entity122 still remains and there is a small police presence on the site			2
police officers are guarding @entity11 and remove all notes posted to it at the end of each day			0
since the protest sites were cleared , demonstrators have resorted to other forms of protest such as the so - called " shopping revolution , " which involves protestors blocking the sidewalks and flooding shopping districts every night with yellow umbrellas			0
thirty protest leaders , including the three founders of @entity141 with @entity142 and @entity143 and several prominent student leaders , have been called by the police to report to the police headquarters in @entity148 district , where they could possibly be arrested and prosecuted for their involvement with the two - month long protest			2
@entity153 have not responded to requests for comment .			0
