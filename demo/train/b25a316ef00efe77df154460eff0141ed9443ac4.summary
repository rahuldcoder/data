@entity15 @entity16 , the respective parties , the @entity17 ( also known as " @entity18 , " " @entity19 , " " @entity20 " or simply " the @entity21 , " among many other names ) and the @entity23 ( also known as " @entity24 , " " @entity25 " or " @entity26 " ) seek a lasting peace , both online and off , and ... @entity16 , online forums , queues for new products and technology blogs have become polluted with smack talk , useless feature comparisons and photoshopped ads meant to deride and belittle each other 's device preference , and ... whereas both sets of parties recognize that a competitive market is both critical and necessary for continued technological innovation to benefit all , especially early adopters ... now , @entity41 , the @entity38 agree to abide by the agreements herein , enumerated in the terms of the articles set forth below : article 1 @entity45 agree not to keep bringing up the august 2012 $ 1 billion patent verdict against @entity4 as a way of trying to squelch any disagreement over who may have copied what , recognizing that the case covered a limited scope of features			1
@entity23 will similarly cease efforts to end all arguments by discussing " @entity56 " versus " closed " platforms , accepting that there are numerous advantages and disadvantages to each			0
article 2 @entity63 wo n't list how many apps are available for @entity65 ( more than 700,000 , since the treaty brought it up ) on every message board about app development while @entity23 will minimize @entity71 discussion of expandable sd - card memory , replaceable batteries , screen size , @entity76 technology or how @entity79 's notifications are still way better than @entity5 's , even after @entity80 was added to @entity65 and @entity77 article 3 both parties will agree that @entity82 , often touted as a selling point by @entity23 , are actually kinda dumb , but then so is @entity5 's " podcast " app , which is just absolutely the worst			1
@entity45 acknowledge that @entity86 would be a nice feature to have while @entity23 admit that late at night , they sometimes wake up screaming from nightmares about product upgrade fragmentation across the @entity79 platform			0
@entity92 @entity45 vow to stop taking the words of @entity94 ( rip ) about going thermonuclear on @entity96 over @entity79 as personal marching orders			0
@entity23 agree to share some of the @entity98 of @entity100 storage that came with their @entity102 phone and to let @entity17 play around with the @entity105 keyboard feature whenever it is requested			0
article 5 both parties agree to a complete and immediate ban on mocking in the following manner : @entity63 will no longer pick up a @entity4 note device and hold it up to their ear , shouting , " hello ! ? i think this phone is too big for my face ! " @entity23 likewise agree to stop posting images online of people holding up @entity116 to take photos , superimposed with the word " fail " on the image			1
article 6 @entity23 agree to immediately boycott and disown television commercials making fun of @entity5 customers standing in line			2
@entity63 , in exchange , promise to stop treating @entity127 and @entity116 launch days like a national holiday or , @entity94 forbid , like the @entity129 of their generation			0
article 7 the oath to be taken by both @entity5 and @entity23 upon ratification of this peace treaty shall be in the following form : " i ... ...			1
do solemnly swear allegiance to all sleek , cutting - edge , full - featured mobile devices , be they made by @entity5 or by manufacturers of @entity79 - based products			1
should i feel the need to criticize , boast by comparison or complain about a product that rivals the one i own and use , such internet - based venom will be directed at a third - party target [ namely @entity151 or , ha ha , @entity153 users			0
" in @entity156 , the respective parties sign this @entity157 by digital signature or @entity159 , then tweet a link for all to see			0
by agreement of both parties , war between @entity5 and @entity23 is declared to have terminated october , 2012 .			2

*writer* *proposes* a peace treaty for " *fanboys* " of @entity5 , @entity4 products
under the modest *proposal* , @entity5 *lovers* would cease citing $ 1 billion lawsuit win
@entity4 *loyalists* , in turn , would stop mocking @entity5 *devotees* ' habit of lining up for everything
both parties reserve the right to mock @entity181 , @entity153
