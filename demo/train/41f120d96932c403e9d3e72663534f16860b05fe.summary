from around @entity1 in western @entity2 to small areas of @entity4 in central @entity5 , @entity0 now controls territory that stretches more than 400 miles across the heart of the @entity8 , according to @entity10 and @entity11 language news accounts as well as accounts on jihadist websites			1
indeed , @entity0 appears to control more territory in the @entity11 world than it has done at any time in its history			1
the focus of @entity0 's leaders has always been regime change in the @entity11 world in order to install @entity22 - style regimes			1
@entity0 's leader @entity23 acknowledged as much in his 2001 autobiography , " @entity25 , " when he explained that the most important strategic goal of @entity0 was to seize control of a state , or part of a state , somewhere in the @entity32 world , explaining that , " without achieving this goal our actions will mean nothing			1
" now @entity23 is closer to his goal than he has ever been			0
on friday @entity0 's affiliate in @entity5 seized control of parts of the city of @entity4 and parts of the city of @entity43 , both of which are located in @entity5 's restive @entity46			1
@entity46 is home to predominantly @entity47 , who feel that that the @entity49 - dominated @entity5 government of prime minister @entity50 treats the @entity47 as second - class citizens			1
sectarian tensions in @entity46 recently burst into several all - out revolts against the government , and the @entity57 ( @entity57 ) , as the @entity0 affiliate there is known , quickly seized the opportunity to notch some battlefield victories			2
government forces increased their presence around @entity4 in response and on tuesday tribal leaders issued a statement urging people who had fled the city or stopped reporting to work to return			0
@entity57 is also operating in @entity2 , where it has established a presence in many areas of the @entity1 and @entity69 in the northwest			2
in august , @entity57 launched a propaganda series on video highlighting their activities in @entity2 , which includes interviews with fighters ; the " graduation " of a group of mujahedin " cubs " ( aged about 7 to 10 years old ) from training , and sermons at local mosques preaching @entity0 's interpretation of @entity32			1
the @entity85 has claimed to control parts of at least a dozen @entity2 towns			2
those include sections of the ancient city of the @entity1 in the northwest , where fighters have been filmed running a community fair and preaching @entity0 's values to crowds of children			2
the group has also released videos on jihadist websites claiming that it is providing services to the people of several towns in the governorate of @entity104 , which borders the @entity105 to the west			0
@entity85 claims that it is a quasi-government and service - provider in the towns of @entity109 , @entity110 , and @entity111			0
@entity85 fighters allied to @entity0 function like a government in areas they control in @entity2			1
the group provides daily deliveries of bread , free running water and electricity , a health clinic , and a strict justice system based on @entity124 law in the eastern @entity2 city of @entity126 , where it also took control of the city 's wheat silos and oil wells			2
in september a @entity133 reporting team concluded , " @entity0 has swept to power with the aim of imposing a strict @entity137 ideology on @entity2 across large swathes of @entity2 's rebel - held north			1
" in sum , @entity0 affiliates now control much of northern and northwestern @entity2 as well as some parts of eastern @entity2 , as well as much of @entity46 province , which is around a third of @entity5 territory			1
@entity85 is engaged in a protracted fight to maintain a foothold in the eastern city of @entity150 , where , as in @entity152 , the militants have their hands on an energy source , this time in the form of natural gas			0
on friday the group released a video on a jihadist website claiming it was grinding some 10 tons of wheat each day to provide bread for the residents of @entity150			0
in the video , a bearded man who identifies himself as part of @entity85 gives a @entity167 tour of a wheat silo where bags of wheat are filled , weighed , and transported to a bread - making facility , where industrial mixers churn dough			0
similar videos released throughout the second half of 2013 depict @entity85 fighters providing health care , legal services , electricity and food to civilians in the cities of @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 , and even the suburbs of the capital @entity188 , where the government still enjoys fairly secure authority			0
@entity0 's expansion in @entity2 will not continue unchecked , though			1
many @entity2 are unhappy about being ruled by the strict jihadist militants			2
over the past several days fighting has broken out between @entity57 and an alliance of various rebel factions in @entity2 , including @entity0 's other affiliate in the country , the @entity85			1
this fighting has taken a toll on @entity57 , which has been forced to withdraw from a number of key @entity2 towns as a result of attacks by the other rebel groups			2
the infighting amongst @entity2 rebels is not good news for the fate of the uprising against @entity2 president @entity209 , but it could prompt the @entity210 to increase its shipments of arms and supplies to " moderate " @entity2 rebels in the @entity215			0
however , even an increase in @entity210 aid to the rebels would be unlikely to sway the conflict significantly , which means @entity209 will remain in power and the war will continue as it has over the past three years			0
secretary of state @entity222 said on sunday that the @entity210 will " do everything that is possible to help " the @entity5 government control @entity0 's expansion in @entity46 , but stressed that no @entity210 troops would be sent back to the @entity8 nation			1
last month , the @entity210 quietly sent hellfire missiles and surveillance drones to the @entity5 government to support their fight against increasing @entity0 - related violence			1
this weaponry is unlikely to make a substantial difference to the mounting violence in @entity5 where violence has returned to the levels it was in 2008 , near the height of the @entity5 war			0
indeed , by any reasonable standard @entity5 is now mired back in a civil war			2
last year almost 8,000 @entity5 civilians were killed in the conflict , according to the @entity245			0
for the @entity210 the widening reach of @entity0 in the @entity8 does n't necessarily translate into an immediate threat at home			1
so far only a handful of @entity210 have fought in the @entity2 conflict alongside @entity0 's affiliates there so concerns about some kind of " blowback " from the @entity2 war in the @entity210 are , at this point , unfounded , @entity258 countries are rightly concerned , however			1
many @entity258 countries have seen their citizens drawn to the @entity2 war ; more than a hundred from @entity263 and many dozens from countries like @entity265 , @entity266 and the @entity267 , according to multiple @entity258 officials we have spoken to			0
these countries are concerned that the retuning veterans of the @entity2 conflict might launch terrorist attacks in @entity258			0
in october for instance , @entity263 authorities arrested militants who were allegedly planning a terrorist attack			0
two @entity263 officials who work on counterterrorism issues told us that that the militants had recently traveled to @entity2			0
the @entity210 and its allies should therefore make a careful effort to track the foreign fighters who have joined jihadist groups fighting in @entity2 .			0

@entity0 affiliates made gains in @entity2 and @entity5 in recent months
@entity287 says @entity0 appears to control more territory in @entity11 world than ever before
he says the focus of @entity0 leaders has always been regime change in @entity8
@entity296 : there is push back against @entity0 from @entity50 regime in @entity5 and from @entity2
