the @entity8 posted the image of a woman in a semi-transparent dress on one of its platforms to the company 's official @entity15 account with a caption warning women that if they dressed like that , they would surely be harassed			1
a @entity15 user who called themselves " @entity22 " posted : " if you think a women dresses improperly , you can call the police but it does n't mean you are free to touch her ... when harassment happens , why is the victim the first one blamed ? " now , pictures have popped up on @entity31 's twitter - like social media site of two women , whose faces are covered by black cloth , protesting the criticism and support is pouring in			1
the pictures , published on @entity38 , showed a woman holding up a sign that translated to " i can be slutty , but you ca n't harass me , " while riding on @entity41			0
the @entity1 metro company said its intention was never to condemn women , but to educate them			2
