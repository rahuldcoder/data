@entity1 's government was famously accused in 2002 by @entity3 president @entity2 of helping terrorism and seeking weapons of mass destruction , along with fellow " axis of evil " countries , @entity8 and @entity9			1
@entity9 's leader @entity10 was overthrown after the @entity3 invaded in 2003 but the other two countries continued to defy the @entity12 by pursuing a nuclear program			1
so what will happen next after the death of @entity1 's leader @entity16 ? how will the death affect military tensions in the region ? after @entity21 's defeat in @entity22 , @entity1 became a divided nation			1
the capitalist south was supported by the @entity3 and its @entity26 allies , and the communist @entity1 became an ally of the @entity28			1
@entity30 tensions erupted in 1950 as the @entity1 invaded the @entity31 , devastating the peninsula and killing up to two million people before the fighting ended after three years with a truce , followed by an armistice			2
technically , the two koreas remain at war , and while the @entity1 is believed to have a standing army of one million soldiers , with reserves estimated at more than seven million , few expect it to launch a general assault on the @entity31			2
what military hardware does @entity1 have ? over the past six decades , skirmishes have flared repeatedly along land and sea borders			2
deadly naval clashes occurred along the demarcation line in 1999 , 2002 , 2009 and 2010			0
@entity50 also accuses @entity51 of running a secret uranium - based nuclear program			0
the @entity3 , along with the two @entity37 , @entity54 , @entity21 and @entity55 , have been involved in what is called the @entity57 , but those negotiations have been slow and arduous			1
following @entity16 's death , @entity51 urged an increase in the @entity1 's " military capability , " prompting @entity62 to put @entity64 forces on high alert			1
@entity66 , from the @entity68 - based @entity67 , said @entity64 raised its alert because it feared @entity70 could be forced to show his toughness with " saber - rattling " and flex the @entity1 's military muscles			1
@entity75 's @entity74 said it remained to be seen how talks would be affected			2
" the issue here , " she said , " is whether it will promote more hardline policies from some of the old guard			0
whether they will circle the wagons around this young man and whether it will put a stop to the negotiations with the @entity3 or whether they will go through nonetheless			2
" what , if anything , will change inside the country ? the state structure in @entity1 , the police , security and military apparatus , is extremely strong , said @entity96 , a research fellow at the @entity97 in @entity98			2
" the idea of people rising up is hard to imagine , " @entity96 told @entity75			0
short - term , @entity96 said , the @entity51 regime could hunker down and " remain stable and inward - oriented , sorting out who is in and who is out			0
" what is in store for @entity1 ? life inside the secretive country @entity1 's @entity110 government has survived mostly by closing itself off and defying the rest of the world			2
the question is , will this strategy continue to work in the years ahead for the third of the @entity16 dynasty to rule @entity1 ? " the news of the death of @entity16 opens a new chapter in the life of this isolated and repressive regime as it negotiates food aid to stave off starvation for its people and attempts to revive economy amid international concerns over its nuclear ambitions , " said @entity98 - based @entity117 , @entity118 president who visited @entity1 six months ago			1
so will the country 's stalinist regime endure ? @entity16 's death could provide an opportunity for change , or trigger instability and even chaos			1
his son , the " @entity70 " @entity70 , now inherits a reclusive , unstable regime confronting political uncertainty , diplomatic isolation , economic malaise and food shortages			0
@entity1 has been dogged by famine since the mid- 1990s when it was hit by severe food shortage caused by floods , drought and economic mismanagement			1
@entity149 agencies based in @entity51 say the @entity1 is in desperate need of outside aid to feed its 24 million people			2
@entity153 : can @entity16 's son survive ? in recent years , dvds smuggled in from abroad showing @entity64 soap operas have become popular , according to @entity75 producer @entity157 , who has visited the country			1
" the difference today is that @entity1 are no longer under the illusion they are living in paradise on earth			0
it is vital for the government to improve their economic prospects			0
but the state still controls people 's lives to an extent almost unimaginable anywhere else			0
" what may have an influence is @entity70 's privileged upbringing			2
he has had an unobstructed view of the outside world that few in his country can have had			0
he was educated partly in a @entity180 secondary school			0
his friends were ordinary @entity182 teenagers and he is reportedly a fan of @entity184 basketball			0
so it would be reasonable to think that this could give him a more modern outlook			0
" it is hard to imagine that @entity1 in the second decade of the 21st century will remain in the same kind of time warp as it seemed to be from in the last decades of the 20th			0
but do n't expect @entity194 - type changes			0
even a move to @entity55 style market socialism is a long way away			0
" what is @entity55 's role ? a significant number of @entity1 have fled to @entity55 to seek freedom and a better life			1
in recent years , economic desperation and diplomatic isolation have prompted @entity16 to visit frequently close allies like @entity55			1
why does @entity55 support @entity1 ? last may , @entity16 visited @entity55 again to ask for continued economic and military aid and political support			1
on this trip @entity16 went with another urgent mission : to introduce to the @entity55 senior leaders his youngest son , @entity70 , as his heir apparent			1
as @entity1 's major ally , experts say , @entity55 's support for the young @entity16 was important			1
@entity55 - @entity1 ties are so close they are frequently described " as close as lips and teeth , " and the two neighbors were @entity221 allies			1
of all the regional powers , @entity222 has the greatest potential leverage over @entity51			0
@entity55 supplies at least 80 % of @entity1 's oil and significant amounts of food , fertilizer and military aid			1
the two @entity231 neighbors have frequent political , military and party - to - party exchanges			0
foremost in @entity222 's mind , @entity1 serves as a buffer , keeping the @entity3 troops stationed in @entity64 away from the @entity55 border			1
@entity55 has a huge stake in @entity1 's stability , experts believe			1
former @entity75 correspondent , @entity241 , a veteran @entity1 - watcher who has visited @entity1 several times , said : " the @entity55 have made it extremely clear that they are not going to let @entity1 go down the drain			2
they are going to do whatever they need to do to prop it up			0
" and how will @entity70 fare ? meantime , experts say , all eyes are on the young and untested @entity70			0
why @entity70 remains an enigma @entity241 , a senior fellow at the @entity253 - based @entity3 @entity252 , notes the young @entity16 's big challenge : " how does somebody who 's not yet 30 win the loyalty and respect and command authority over the entrenched party apparatus , the entrenched military bureaucracy , and the senior party officials who may have been in their positions for a long time ? " @entity16 had two decades to learn the ropes , develop his network of connections and establish his authority under his father , @entity269 's tutelage and protection			1
even so , @entity241 said , when @entity269 died in 1994 , the young @entity16 was dogged with speculations : " was he going to last ? " by contrast , @entity70 only had two years to ascend last year as a senior party leader and four - star general			1
the young @entity16 is expected to rely on powerful backers of close relatives , including @entity16 's sister and brother - in - law @entity279 , who experts say will serve as regents , tutoring behind the scene			1
so despite all the problems that @entity16 left behind , some korea - watchers do not expect @entity1 to implode immediately			2
after his last visit to @entity51 last august , @entity241 told @entity75 : " i was struck by the notion that succession was on track -- not a lot of internal discord about it			0
" nor is any huge policy change expected			0
" @entity16 has not been put into his position by a group of young @entity296 hoping to change the system , but by an elderly and entrenched elite , " said @entity75 's @entity157			2
" their interests lie firmly in continuing the current power structure			0
" so while gradual change over time may be possible , if on a limited scale , the imminent collapse of the regime is unlikely			0
