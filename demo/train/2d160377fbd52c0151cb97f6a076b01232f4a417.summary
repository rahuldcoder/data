last night , a video emerged of the execution of @entity3 journalist @entity2 , at the hands of @entity6 's @entity5 , the extreme jihadist group that has illegitimately declared the establishment of a militant " caliphate " in @entity9 and @entity10			1
this latest execution video follows that of a similar crime committed against another @entity3 journalist , @entity14 , a fortnight ago			1
like the first " message to @entity3 , " this latest video ended with the executioner threatening to behead another captive non-combatant , this time a @entity19			1
first and foremost , it is imperative that we do not allow the traction that these videos have gained in the @entity24 to eclipse @entity5 's other inhumane actions			1
in years gone by , @entity5 -- which refers to itself as the @entity26 -- and its forebears have consistently and persistently committed the most atrocious of war crimes against communities in the @entity30			1
in the last month alone , it has been held responsible for attempting a genocide against the @entity33 minority sect , as well as the extermination of the @entity35 of @entity36			0
these come on top of the wholesale massacre it committed against the @entity42 peoples of the @entity44 tribe in @entity9 in august , as well as countless other summary executions of people it deems to be its enemies			0
we must not be fooled into thinking that @entity5 only beheads its @entity50 captives ; last week , a @entity52 man - unarmed , of course - was executed in front of a mosque in @entity56 in a video entitled " a message written in blood			1
" but because it was directed at the president of @entity62 , this particular piece of propaganda did not receive widespread coverage in the international media			0
a cursory glance at @entity5 propaganda suggests that the @entity24 is its primary target			1
while this may be the case in terms of the group 's long - term ambitions , events on the ground in @entity9 and @entity10 paint a very different picture , with @entity5 predominantly killing those it deems to be " apostate " , including its co-religionists			1
in light of events in @entity9 and @entity10 , the international community must react robustly and swiftly			0
this week 's @entity84 summit is fortuitously timed , and one would hope that the @entity5 crisis takes its place at the top of the meeting 's agenda			1
however , as i 've said before , a strategy of solely @entity50 intervention would play right into the @entity5 ideology			1
indeed , it would be exactly what the group wants			2
as such , it is paramount that other states -- particularly those within the region -- step up to the plate as well			0
countries such as @entity103 and @entity104 must actively respond instead of leaving it to others			0
it is not just the international community that has a responsibility , though : the media must act as well			0
it is paramount that it carefully considers its treatment of @entity5 propaganda , with its twin aims of intimidation and recruitment			2
every time a still or clip from an @entity5 video is shown , the group gets what it wants : the oxygen of publicity			1
of course , it is necessary that people the world over are aware of the atrocities occurring at the hands of @entity5 , but journalists must be careful not to do the jihadists ' job for them			2
this also involves establishing a firm no - platform policy for @entity136 's stooges in the @entity24			1
these insidious individuals thrive on media attention , which they use to amplify their otherwise ostracized voices			0
as @entity142 's last report , which looked at extremist content online , showed , it is an unfortunate truth that online censorship does not work			2
any attempts at censorship in the aftermath of the @entity14 killing were always doomed to failure			0
simply put , corporations and governments are unable to remove propaganda from the internet at the rate that it is uploaded			0
more effective than government - led censorship was the " @entity5 media blackout , " in which users across the internet resolutely refused to publicize @entity5 material			2
after all , videos like these have minimal propaganda value if they have no audience			2
at the same time , instead of publicizing what @entity5 wants , we must popularize what it does n't			1
the @entity169 fatwa recently released by prominent @entity42 @entity171 imams would be a good place to start , because it dismantles any sense of legitimacy for the self - proclaimed " caliphate " and directly calls for @entity177 communities to take an active stance in opposing this appalling group			0
more initiatives like this must emerge			0
that they have not materialized already is testament an untenable situation in which the vast majority of @entity35 , who are invariably moderate , are largely silent , something which leaves extremists to dominate the discourse on @entity190			0
the time has passed when we can allow @entity5 to popularize itself unchallenged			1
challenging @entity5 propaganda must be at the forefront of international policy towards @entity9 and @entity10			2
and it is not just something for governments to deal with			0
people all over the world , @entity177 and @entity200 alike , are responsible too .			0

@entity24 outraged at beheading of second @entity3 *hostage* by @entity5 militants
@entity207 : *gruesome* videos must not " eclipse @entity5 's other inhumane actions "
every time an @entity5 video is shown , the group gets what it wants : publicity
" the time has passed when we can allow @entity5 to popularize itself unchallenged "
