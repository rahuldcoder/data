-- even at the age of 82 the work ethic still burns bright in @entity3 , the man who inspired a generation of baby - boomers to take up golf and whose support of the @entity8 proved pivotal for its future success			1
the elite of world golf gather at @entity12 and @entity13 this week on the 50th anniversary of @entity3 's crushing victory at @entity18 links course @entity16 in 1962 -- and " @entity3 " still exerts a significant influence on the sport he once dominated			1
" i would like to be remembered for bringing golf to a worldwide audience , " @entity3 told @entity0			2
" players today have no boundaries			0
" as part of golf 's " @entity34 , " @entity3 helped pioneering player agent @entity28 take the sport around the globe in the 1960s , capitalizing on the ever - growing reach of television			1
why @entity36 golf has a healthy future the tournament @entity3 still proudly hosts in the last week of march , at his @entity40 course in @entity41 , attracts a stellar international lineup and was won this year by @entity43			1
he is a very hands - on host , making sure the course is in top condition and appearing daily on the television coverage of the event			0
this year , he suffered a health scare after leaving the tv tower on the final day -- a blood pressure problem , according to his family -- and could not give out the prizes as has been tradition			0
but @entity3 has made a full recovery and now , half century on from his second @entity58 @entity8 triumph , the spotlight has again fallen on his trailblazing achievements			1
a leader of men when he first played golf 's oldest tournament in 1960 , it had fallen out of favor with @entity36 pros			1
@entity67 in 1953 was the last from the @entity36 to win it , and only three entered in 1959 -- put off by the long journey and comparatively low prize money on offer			2
again there were only three @entity36 in the 74 - man field at @entity74 , one being the legendary @entity75 -- still playing late into his 50s on a lifetime exemption dating back to his 1932 success			2
@entity3 failed to emulate @entity67 's triple - major feat , falling one shot short of @entity82 following earlier victories at the masters and @entity85 , but he returned to the @entity58 the next year and claimed the coveted " @entity86 " at @entity87			1
@entity3 had already won his third @entity89 crown before romping to victory at @entity16 in 1962			1
" i got it going in the final round and it was very enjoyable , " he told @entity0			0
ever modest , @entity3 's margin of victory over @entity82 was six shots and he was a remarkable 13 strokes clear of third place			1
his 1961 exploits had inspired a young @entity98 to make his @entity58 @entity8 debut at @entity16 , and the " @entity98 " won it for the first time in 1966 -- two years after compatriot @entity102 also triumphed at @entity74			1
by then @entity3 had been represented by @entity28 for several years , and their partnership helped changed the face of golf and modern sports			1
famous deal @entity28 was a @entity109 attorney , only a year older than @entity3 , and they famously struck their deal in 1960 with just a handshake			1
@entity28 had seen his client 's potential , and the increased television coverage of golf was extending his appeal to a wider audience			1
" he was very smart			0
he was a motivator and went after it , and that was something i enjoyed , " recalled @entity3			2
@entity28 later persuaded @entity98 and @entity125 's @entity124 to join @entity3 at his @entity126 ( @entity126 ) and the " @entity34 " was born , popularizing golf worldwide in a series of made - for - television events			1
but @entity3 held a very special place in the affections of the golfing galleries and it is easy to see why with his attacking play and flamboyant style			2
he was the first golfer to attract his own special following -- " @entity136 " -- diehard fans who surrounded every green to cheer him on , win or lose			0
woods in his pomp had a similar fan base decades later , but @entity3 was the first and he appreciated their support			1
" they only encouraged me to continue to do the things i was doing and gave me the confidence i needed , " he said			0
@entity147 star but it was not only his fine play which drew them in			0
he had that " something " -- an aura , charisma combined with good looks			0
a hitch of his tightly fitting pants followed most shots , and his stylish outfits made him stand out from the average pro. " it was not something i really planned , " @entity3 admitted			2
" i liked a sharp crease in my slacks , my shoes polished to shine , while my shirts were conservative with a straight collar			0
" it was a style i stuck with for most of my career			0
" intentional or not , it has proved popular			0
@entity169 named him one of the " 50 most stylish men of the past 50 years " and @entity171 had him in a list of the " 75 best - dressed men of all time			0
" golfers are rarely remembered for their fashion sense , usually the exact opposite , but the outfits he wore in 1962 have been recreated for a new range of @entity180			0
@entity3 wanted promising @entity182 player @entity181 to don the outfits -- " i took a particular liking to him when he won the @entity186 , a very polite young man " -- and he has got his wish			2
@entity181 has won once on the lucrative @entity36 calendar , in 2009 , but if he can achieve a fraction of @entity3 's achievements in golf , he will count himself lucky			1
seven major wins , 62 in all on the @entity182 , not to mention his later exploits on the @entity196 circuit -- which he more than any other golfer helped publicize and give legitimacy to the idea of golfers aged 50 plus still competing at the top level			0
endorsing success with the business acumen of @entity28 promoting his off - course activities , @entity3 lent his image to a host of products and services , becoming the first sportsman to show that income from commercial endorsements could outstrip prize - money earnings			1
" @entity28 was very good at marketing , " @entity3 said , and where he led , others were quick to follow			1
with the " @entity34 " dominating golf , @entity28 branched out into other sports such as tennis and then into the world of showbiz			2
he even marketed a papal tour of @entity58 in 1982			0
by the time @entity28 died in 2003 , @entity126 was the most powerful sports marketing company in the world and had @entity223 as its star client			2
@entity3 's own commercial activities have helped him amass an estimated $ 675 million fortune , which is still growing despite his retirement from competitive golf in 2006			1
he is proud of his legacy on and off the course , and is optimistic for the future , particularly with golf winning inclusion to the @entity234 in @entity235			0
" we will see more @entity238 countries participating			0
i think that 's important , and we will see interest getting to the point when we can rival soccer and tennis , " he predicted			0
@entity3 may well get his wish , but he has already forged his place in golfing history as a true trailblazer .			0

this week marks 50th anniversary of @entity3 's second victory at @entity8
@entity3 's support of @entity58 major helped popularize the tournament internationally
@entity36 's partnership with agent @entity28 changed the face of sports
@entity3 shows no sign of easing up at the age of 82
