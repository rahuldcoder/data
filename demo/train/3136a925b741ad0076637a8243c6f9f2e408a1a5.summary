@entity1 , the leader of the @entity3 militant group @entity2 , was killed this week in a @entity5 military operation , the @entity0 said friday			1
" the @entity5 military undertook operations against @entity1 on sept. 1 , which led to his death			1
removing @entity1 from the battlefield is a major symbolic and operational loss to @entity2 , " said @entity0 press secretary rear adm. @entity10			1
on monday , @entity5 military conducted a strike in the @entity16 country targeting @entity1 , who had pledged allegiance to @entity18			1
he headed @entity2 as it terrorized @entity16 , killing @entity3 officials , aid workers and others in a spate of suicide bombings			2
@entity1 allegedly was behind 2013 's deadly siege of a @entity26 , @entity27 , shopping mall			1
before this week 's strike , the @entity5 military was tipped off to what @entity10 called " actionable intelligence ... strong enough " to suggest @entity1 's whereabouts			1
in response , @entity5 commandos flew -- aided by drones -- into an area south of the @entity3 capital , @entity37 , around 6:20 p.m. ( 11:20 a.m. et ) monday			2
@entity38 , governor of @entity3 's @entity40 region , characterized the attack near the port city of @entity43 as so ferocious " it jolted the entire region			2
" @entity38 said , " i never heard such a huge and deafening blast as the result of the airstrike			0
" earlier this week , @entity10 did n't elaborate on how much firepower was involved , beyond the use of hellfire and laser - guided missiles			0
@entity3 intelligence officials counted at least four such missiles			0
after the attack , an @entity56 account said one person was killed but asserted it was n't @entity1			0
" ' @entity64 ' is alive and doing fine , " the tweet said , calling itself an " official mujahedin account " in the @entity63 land of @entity3			0
at the time , @entity65 was unable to verify the authenticity of that claim on @entity56			0
the man behind @entity2 @entity1 , who was also known as @entity69 , became the leader of @entity2 in 2008			2
traditionally , @entity2 focused on bringing @entity63 rule to @entity3 , attracting dozens of ethnic @entity3 -- and a few @entity72 -- from the @entity5 and @entity73			1
but last year @entity1 seemed to be refocusing the group on terrorist attacks beyond @entity3 -- against @entity16 states supporting the @entity3 government , especially @entity78 and @entity27 , and against @entity80 interests in @entity16			1
the september 2013 @entity82 attack in @entity27 's capital was @entity2 's most audacious , but the massacre that left 67 people dead was n't the group 's first strike outside @entity3			1
in 2010 , @entity2 carried out suicide bombings in the @entity78 capital , @entity90 , in which more than 70 people were killed			0
still , the @entity82 siege demonstrated @entity1 's desire to align his group more closely with @entity18			2
in a taped message afterward , he noted the attack took place " just 10 days after the anniversary date of the blessed 9/11 operations			0
" under @entity1 , @entity2 became a formal ally of @entity18			0
the move led to dissent in the group , which @entity1 dealt with ruthlessly , using his control of @entity2 's intelligence wing			2
the @entity5 jihadist @entity106 was reportedly killed in september 2013 after criticizing @entity1 's leadership and his treatment of foreign fighters			1
@entity1 was said to be 37 years old , and was originally from @entity110 in northern @entity3			0
he was slim to the point of wispy , as seen in the few photographs of him , and preferred recording audio messages to appearing in public			0
a former @entity3 prime minister , @entity116 , once described @entity1 as the cleverest of @entity2 's leaders			1
the @entity5 government 's @entity118 listed him under another alias , @entity121 , and offered up to $ 7 million last year for information leading to his location .			0

@entity1 was the leader of @entity3 militant group @entity2
he allegedly was behind 2013 's deadly siege of a @entity26 , @entity27 , shopping mall
@entity5 military attack killed him this week , @entity0 says
his death is " a major symbolic and operational loss to @entity2 , " official says
