-- if you 've ever heard a corny joke , it likely was an @entity4 joke			0
these are launched against those of us who hold @entity4 ( aka the " @entity8 " ) near and dear , usually by fans of our arch - rival , the @entity11			0
some are pretty funny , such as this one : " did you hear about the @entity4 that drove his pickup into the lake ? his dog drowned while he tried to get the tailgate down			0
" after today 's hearing , i 'm confident a new one will become popular : " did you hear that joke of a congressman who actually felt sorry for @entity24 ? @entity26 , he was that @entity4 , @entity27			1
" anyone who has read or listened to me knows that i am proud of my native @entity29 , and especially my alma mater , @entity4			0
but after listening to @entity27 apologize this morning to @entity24 officials for having to set aside $ 20 billion in an escrow fund to assist the victims of the biggest oil disaster in @entity36 history , i am ashamed that this poor excuse of an elected official has disgraced his @entity29 congressional district			1
it should n't matter that @entity27 is often representing the interests of the oil industry			1
any sane person would be outraged at the response thus far of @entity24 , as well as the insensitive and asinine comments by company representatives			2
in his opening statement , @entity27 was so over the top that even his fellow @entity49 must have thought he bumped his head on his way into today 's hearing			1
" i 'm ashamed of what happened in the @entity54 yesterday			2
i think it is a tragedy of the first proportion that a private corporation can be subjected to what i would characterize as a shakedown -- in this case a $ 20 billion shakedown			0
" a shakedown ? the federal government , the states of @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 have had to amass tens of thousands of workers , and spend millions of dollars trying to do all they can to contain the oil gushing out of the bottom of the @entity73			1
businesses have shut down , fishermen are trying to figure out how they are going to feed their families in the wake of the devastation , and beaches along the @entity80 are closed , preventing tourists from spending dollars in the region			0
all of his because of the explosion on @entity24 's oil platform 60 days ago that killed 11 people and continues to cause irreparable harm to the environment			1
but that means nothing to @entity27 , who truly is carrying the oil of the industry			2
you would think that a man who is always talking about government spending and fiscal conservatism would want a private company to foot the bill for an oil spill			1
why should the @entity36 taxpayer have to spend our precious dollars to clean up the massive mess ? when the @entity106 's twin towers were brought down on september 11 , 2001 , the federal government created the september 11 @entity107			2
nearly $ 7 billion was awarded , and that event was n't the federal government 's fault			2
it is right , fair and just that the @entity113 administration should force @entity24 to fork over billions to assist those who have seen their way of life destroyed by the oil spill , and the @entity36 taxpayer , including those in @entity27 's district , should feel confident that @entity24 will repay the federal government and the states every penny spent on cleaning up their mess			1
any man or woman with a conscience should deplore @entity27 's comments , and no @entity49 should stand with him			1
either you are on the side of @entity24 or the @entity36 people , especially those in the @entity73			0
@entity27 , shame on you			0
and when i bump into you in @entity136 at a @entity4 football game , i 'll tell you this personally			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity140 .			0

rep. @entity27 apologized to @entity24 officials for " shakedown " by @entity54
@entity140 says @entity27 's claim was outrageous
he says the @entity54 properly got @entity24 to set up fund for oil victims
he says taxpayers should be relieved government wo n't have to foot bill
