-- @entity2 's three children have a lot of questions about the situation in @entity6			2
his youngest daughter , 8 , pointed to a world map a couple of days ago and asked , " @entity10 , @entity9 is so big			2
why does it need our small peninsula ? " @entity2 , 42 , and his family live in @entity15 , the regional capital of @entity16 , @entity6			1
soldiers without national insignias -- but whom everyone presumes to be @entity9 -- started showing up on thursday , he said			1
that day , @entity2 said he got a call from his children 's school to take them , because teachers were afraid to let them go on their own , and they had to stay at home friday			2
the downtown was blocked by police from thursday until sunday , @entity2 said			1
it felt surreal , he said			2
" i was afraid , but i prayed to @entity29			2
" @entity9 forces have surrounded 10 @entity6 military bases -- 16,000 troops in the past week , according to @entity6 officials			1
no fighting or loss of life has been reported , but @entity16 citizens such as @entity2 are nervous about what will happen next			1
many ethnic @entity9 live in @entity16 , where support for @entity9 is strong			1
part of @entity9 's navy -- the @entity9 @entity41 -- has a base in @entity16 's city of @entity44 that has been there for 230 years			1
@entity2 is a @entity9 - speaking @entity6 and his wife is @entity9			2
this week their children are back in school , and the streets are open again			1
in that respect , life has returned to normal , but having @entity9 troops present is " not ok , " @entity2 said			1
not far from the parliament , soldiers are stationed in and outside of armored cars on one side of the street , @entity2 said			2
he sees no reason for them and it 's unclear to him what the troops are protecting			1
meanwhile , @entity2 has noticed gas prices rise some 25 % over the last 10 days , and many foods have become more expensive too			1
a local market was out of two kinds of rice , canned meat and other products yesterday , he said			2
" there was panic and people tried to buy much more than they usually buy , " he said			2
@entity9 ambassador @entity73 said at an emergency @entity75 meeting monday that his country 's aims were preserving democracy , protecting millions of @entity9 in @entity6 and stopping radical extremists			0
he said ousted president @entity81 remains @entity6 's elected leader and has asked @entity9 to send troops			1
other diplomats at the meeting asked for the withdrawal of @entity9 troops and called for a mediation to resolve the crisis			1
@entity6 crisis : @entity9 stands firm despite rebukes , threats of sanctions @entity9 president @entity93 said tuesday his military is n't planning to seize the @entity16 peninsula			1
any action would " only be to protect local people , " he said			0
@entity6 looks for ' sign of hope ' from @entity9 over @entity16 in the coastal @entity6 city of @entity102 , @entity100 has n't seen any firsthand evidence of a @entity9 invasion , but remains " gloomy " about the uncertain situation			1
@entity100 has seen no @entity9 troops , protests , or other abnormal sightings in connection with the situation this week			1
when @entity81 fled on february 22 , supermarket shelves were sparse for two or three days , but they were currently stocked , and prices did not appear to be rising , he said his friends tell him that in @entity44 , about a 52 - mile drive away on the peninsula , there are soldiers standing around doing nothing			0
@entity100 can only speculate about what that means			0
" for me , it seems like big talks are going ( on ) behind our backs , " he said			0
" that 's why the troops are doing nothing , because they have no order			2
they do n't want to start a war themselves maybe			0
maybe everyone 's waiting for talks to end , for some decision to be made			0
" he worries about being cut off from gas , electricity or @entity137			2
more philosophically , he said he does n't want to live in a @entity9 region under @entity9 power			0
" the worst feeling is that i feel unsure about what will be tomorrow , " he said			0
" my thoughts are : this wo n't end fast			0
this invasion , this @entity9 position , wo n't be resolved in a month			0
not even in two months i think			0
" @entity100 , 35 , was born in @entity16 , while @entity6 was still part of the @entity147			1
the region is mostly @entity9 - speaking , with people preferring @entity9 movies and news , he said			0
" here in @entity16 it 's hard to identify your nationality , " he said			1
@entity100 's family , also living in @entity102 , is divided			1
his aging father says he is n't afraid of anything			0
one sister tells @entity100 they should think about how to get out if the situation becomes deadly			0
the other sister completely supports @entity9			0
" i ca n't even talk to her because she turns very aggressive if i criticize @entity9 ways , " @entity100 said			0
most people he knows over 30 seem to support @entity9 , while younger people do not , he said			0
regardless of opinion , lots of people are talking about the situation most of the day , he said			0
if living in @entity102 becomes dangerous , @entity100 said he will try to find a way out , and perhaps go to @entity171			1
@entity2 does n't want to leave @entity15 , where he is a minister in a church			1
he feels responsible for staying and helping people there			0
he might reconsider if war breaks out , but for now , he says , " it 's my calling to be here			0
" but his children want to know : if @entity16 becomes part of @entity9 , will we move ? what if there is war ? @entity2 told his daughter that @entity9 has not taken @entity16 yet , and hopes it will not happen			1
" we hope that it will stay in @entity6 , and we will not have to move from this place where we all were born , " he said			0
