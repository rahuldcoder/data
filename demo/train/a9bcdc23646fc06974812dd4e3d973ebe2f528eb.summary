-- it starts with a squiggle on an abandoned building , then another , and another , until the once - blank wall is transformed into a mural			0
a tag from the author marks the final touch			0
eventually , this makeshift canvas will be wiped clean , restored to a mundane white wall , so the process can begin again			0
it 's the nature of street art : spontaneous , public , fleeting			1
inspired by graffiti 's transient nature , @entity14 said he went through a @entity18 phase at age 15 , referring to the @entity21 street artist known for his subversive and polarizing street exhibits			1
@entity18 spurred the young @entity23 to begin spray painting garages with colorful aerosols			2
" back then it was more , ' screw you mom and dad , i am going to draw on walls			0
' back then it was n't about the artistic side , " he said of his youthful rebellion			0
the 31 - year - old , known across @entity36 as the artist @entity37 , is hesitant to call himself a graffiti or even a street artist			1
the former @entity42 schoolteacher , whose sprawling murals are found across @entity36 walls and commissioned by both private companies and individuals , instead sees himself as a public artist			1
because of his use of spray paint , people around the city still call him a street artist			1
but what 's the difference , anyway ? " well , graffiti is illegal for one thing ... but it 's a true art form , " @entity14 said			1
what started as a subculture on the streets of @entity60 in the 1970s has gained popularity in the decades since			0
graffiti , often used synonymously with street art , has become aesthetically trendy in many places across @entity65			1
@entity66 said graffiti is celebrated in his @entity69 , @entity60 , neighborhood of @entity70			2
" there are even art appreciation tours that include some of the street art , " he said			1
opinion : @entity76 street art should be embraced street art is a culture in @entity69			1
" i appreciate the capability and expression of the street artists in the area who have transformed streets that were considered common industrial sites , " he said			2
" what impresses me most is that graffiti ca n't be bought , " @entity66 said			2
although graffiti was introduced to @entity65 street culture in the 1970s , @entity23 said the technique was around before then			2
" graffiti in its current state has been around for decades			2
it is probably one of the largest art trends to last , " he said			2
" think about pop art , it only lasted for 20 years , and it was one of the biggest trends			2
i mean , even cave paintings can be considered ' graffiti , ' " he said			2
what is graffiti ? " graffiti is an affirmation of the individual , " said @entity105 , curator of modern and contemporary at the @entity106			2
" the idea of graffiti has a lot to do with raw energy and authenticity			2
" in the realm of public space , street and public art are often indistinguishable			1
sometimes , what was once viewed as graffiti becomes pricey art. @entity105 points to @entity18 as an example			1
" @entity18 came from the streets and now has gallery shows and auctions , " she said			2
despite @entity18 's rise into the high - end art world , he still hides his identity , she pointed out			1
there is more to street art than who creates it , @entity105 said			1
" like @entity18 , who is socially and politically driven , graffiti is driven by almost a communal pride , " she said			1
street art is considered rebellious in nature and illegal in practice , while public art is commissioned by cities or property owners and is considered culturally enriching and socially acceptable			1
artists have used public spaces to showcase themes and bring awareness to issues			2
@entity146 was captivated when she saw blue trees in @entity149 's downtown area			0
what @entity151 saw was " @entity152 , " part of a public art installation by @entity156 artist @entity155			1
@entity155 covered the trees in a natural water - base pigment			0
the purpose of the piece is to bring awareness to global deforestation , according to his website			0
like @entity155 , @entity23 sees public space as a canvas and public art as an avenue to bring his aerosol - inspired artwork to a larger audience , further blurring the lines between street and public art. ' weird divide between highbrow and lowbrow ' but does blurring the lines mean selling out ? @entity23 said he does n't think so			1
in fact , he said he has been hoping to enter the realm of public art for a long time			1
he sees being a public artist as an opportunity			2
" every time you do mural work , it is like another advertisement of yourself , " he said			0
" and this is the year for me to get into bigger galleries and publications			0
" but he said people try to differentiate the two			0
" there is this weird divide between highbrow and lowbrow in the art world , " he said			0
even @entity18 has been accused of becoming too commercialized			2
on the artist 's website , one commenter wrote , " why are you such a sell out ? " @entity18 responded , " i wish i had a pound for every time someone asked me that			1
" what some call selling out , @entity23 said he sees as appreciation by a wider audience			0
graffiti 's aerosol imagery is gaining popularity and is becoming increasing socially acceptable , he said			0
movements such as @entity205 , which uses pressurized water to leave behind clean messages and images on the streets of @entity60 , or the increasing use of commercial graffiti , where street artists are hired to create graffiti - based advertisements in cities such as @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity60 and @entity36 , also shine light on the increasing commercialism of graffiti			1
but graffiti for hire is n't something for which @entity23 is necessarily enthusiastic			0
he recounted a recent art project that @entity225 in @entity36 commissioned			1
" they commissioned a bunch of local graffiti artists			0
it was this huge bubble art , and it was defaced the next day			0
it is almost an insult to the work of graffiti artists , when companies come into a place and just create advertisements in a form of graffiti art , " he said			1
@entity239 of @entity240 , @entity60 , lives in an area filled with graffiti , and he agrees with the sentiment			0
" street art to me is a person showing his talent ; many artists go undiscovered , " @entity244 said			1
" they take chances when and where they do it			0
" what do we do with graffiti ? @entity23 said @entity36 has a love - hate relationship with street art. " in @entity36 there was a big push to stomp out graffiti , yet there is a huge desire by people who want street art , too , " he said			1
in 2011 , the city of @entity36 's @entity267 was funded $ 10,000 to crack down on graffiti			1
the task force , whose aim is to keep the city clean and prevent further vandalism , made several arrests of local street artists			1
but graffiti can be found is many cities across the @entity65			0
@entity278 of @entity279 , @entity280 , said street art is a familiar site in his city			1
" sometimes it 's beautiful and interesting graffiti and other times it 's beautiful elaborate murals that just show up randomly on local business walls , " @entity278 said in a @entity284			0
" much of it finds a home with a lot of appreciation for quite a while until someone replaces it with something new			0
" whether graffiti should be criminalized , however , can be subjective			0
" if it 's just random tagging to scar property and identify someone 's ego -- it 's a crime , " @entity278 said			0
" however , when you happen to walk through some dilapidated back alley and you find a giant , beautiful , sweet face of @entity307 staring at you on some old forgotten brick wall and it simply says ' @entity309 ' next to it , that to me expresses something powerful			0
" @entity23 said he finds the paradox in the public 's attitude toward street art interesting			1
" people hate the tags , but they want the murals , " he said			0
" i think there is a misunderstanding , and people do n't realize that it is all connected and all related			0
you ca n't have the mural without the tag			0
