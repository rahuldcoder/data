@entity0 -- @entity5 gov. @entity4 is laying the groundwork for a presidential campaign with the intent of being ready should @entity9 not run , a source close to the governor told @entity1			1
@entity4 amplified 2016 speculation when he told the @entity11 last week that he ca n't wait for the former first lady and secretary of state to make a decision			2
he told @entity1 on monday that he was working toward offering " a better direction for our country			0
" sounds like he 's planning to go for it , right ? not quite			0
@entity4 is angling to be the person who could step in should @entity20 decide to forgo a second @entity22 candidacy			1
she 's the odd - on favorite in early polls to capture the @entity26 nomination should she throw her hat in the ring			1
" the big question is n't what happens if she runs , it 's what happens if she does n't , " the source said			0
" in that sense , he is trying to lay the groundwork so that democrats are n't left without any potential candidates			0
" though , there 's always vice president @entity39 , whose considering a bid , and a number of other @entity26 in and out of @entity0 who would probably take a shot			2
but outside of @entity39 , who can probably wait a little longer than most due to his name recognition and certain advantages associated with his office , no one else outside of @entity4 is setting themselves up as he is for becoming @entity20 's understudy			1
and that may be with good reason , as an @entity4 vs. @entity20 race would likely be an uphill slog for the governor			1
a @entity1 / @entity56 poll this week showed 70 % of @entity26 support her nomination			2
note , @entity20 was the heavy favorite in 2008 only to be overtaken by @entity60			1
but no one in the potential @entity26 field is seen at this early moment as electrifying and transformational as @entity60 was that year			1
instead of stoking speculation , the source said @entity4 is being a good party man			0
he 's helping president @entity60 's initiatives , helping to build infrastructure for 2014 and supporting candidates as he travels the country			2
@entity20 lurks in corner of @entity72 meeting looking more closely , here how it breaks down for @entity4 and what 's likely influencing his thinking around @entity9 and a presidential run			1
numbers : if you are n't named @entity9 , the reality is that most democrats do n't want to nominate you for president			2
and for @entity4 , who has little name recognition outside the @entity84 , the numbers are particularly stark			0
in last month 's @entity11 / @entity86 poll , @entity4 did n't register as one of the candidates @entity26 would choose for 2016			1
in a november 2013 @entity1 / @entity89 , 2 % of @entity26 said they would like to see @entity4 nominated for president in 2016			1
stoking speculation -- and traveling the country to support candidates -- will certainly raise his profile			0
but name recognition might be only part of @entity4 's problem			2
in a @entity11 poll early last year , only 8 % of @entity5 @entity26 -- people who likely know the governor 's record -- said they would back him in a hypothetical nomination in 2016			1
@entity20 , on the other hand , was preferred by 56 % of @entity5 democrats			2
money : @entity4 's " @entity106 " announced it raised $ 1.6 million in 2013 , money that was used to help a number of state and local candidates			0
sure , that money is nothing to sneeze at , but fundraising off the @entity20 name is substantially more lucrative			0
for example , @entity115 -- a super pac urging @entity20 to run -- raised more than $ 4 million in 2013			0
politics : if @entity4 were to run , he 'd be running from the left of the @entity26			1
and while that would fit his record , there seems to little room in the race for a liberal candidate			0
for the past eight years , @entity4 has led @entity5 as a proud liberal			2
he has tightened gun laws , implemented a progressive tax code and helped legalize same - sex marriage			0
he also expanded the state 's health care rolls and championed @entity133			0
the governor is now , less than a year before he leaves the office , pushing for the cherry on top of his governing record : a raise of the @entity5 minimum wage to $ 10.10			0
and while @entity20 would support most -- if not all -- of the proposals @entity4 has pursued , new polling shows the space for a liberal alternative to @entity20 is n't that big			1
a @entity1 / @entity89 out monday showed only 10 % of @entity26 said they would want someone more liberal than @entity20			2
history : at @entity147 in may 2007 , @entity4 proudly endorsed @entity20 's bid for the presidency , telling the assembled media that " she is ready today			1
she is ready to lead			0
" @entity4 was n't just your average supporter , either			0
during the 2008 primaries -- which pitted @entity20 against then - sen. @entity60 -- @entity4 was outspoken and raised a substantial amount of money			1
he was one of the first governors to endorse @entity20			0
he was even among the @entity20 campaign 's " hillraisers , " a group of loyal @entity26 who funneled more than $ 100,000 in donations to the campaign			1
the point of all this : should @entity20 run in 2016 , @entity4 would likely be a supporter			1
@entity39 : @entity20 wo n't really affect his 2016 decision			0

@entity5 governor laying the groundwork for a presidential run in case @entity9 does n't run
@entity20 is odds - on favorite to capture the @entity26 nomination at the moment
head - to - head , @entity4 *dwarfed* by @entity20 's name recognition , fundraising prowess
he supported her *strongly* in 2008 when she lost nomination to @entity60
