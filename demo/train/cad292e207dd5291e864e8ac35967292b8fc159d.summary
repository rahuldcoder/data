-- @entity2 's young leader has been in the job for more than a year and has managed to step out of the considerable shadow left by his late father , @entity5			1
the humiliation of april 's failed rocket launch after a typically jingoistic build - up was followed up by a successful attempt in december despite a chorus of international condemnation			1
@entity13 claimed it had put a satellite into orbit , while the @entity16 and @entity17 insisted it was all a cover for testing ballistic missile technology			0
when the @entity21 expanded sanctions as punishment , the @entity2 leadership bared its teeth and vowed to conduct another nuclear test and continue experimenting with long - range rockets -- with the @entity16 in mind			0
@entity28 seems determined to make his own mark as leader			1
far from floundering in his own inexperience , @entity5 has worked swiftly to consolidate his power base domestically by replacing senior figures in the military -- many loyal to his father -- with his own people			1
whereas the elder @entity5 's leadership was centered around " military first " politics and tied to the powerful @entity40 , a government body , the younger @entity5 is returning the center of gravity for the regime back to the @entity45 apparatus , according to @entity46 , director of the @entity47 at @entity48 , a not - for - profit research and analysis organization			1
but some @entity2 watchers believe the @entity52 - educated fan of @entity54 movies and basketball lacks the absolute power enjoyed by his father and his grandfather , @entity59 , the founder of @entity2			2
" i believe he is in overall control of the @entity45 , the military , and the state -- but with the help of his uncle , @entity70 , and his family confident , @entity72 , chief of the general political bureau of the @entity74 , " said @entity61 - in @entity62 , professor of political science at @entity64 in @entity17			0
" whereas his father @entity5 had the absolute consolidation of power base and direct full control of the party , the military , and the state , his son @entity28 seems to reign than rule			1
" @entity62 added that his aunt , @entity84 , is the other main influence on the younger @entity5			2
however , the 20 - something leader has a very different style to his father , demonstrating a softer , seemingly personable side			1
in the last 12 months , the world was introduced to his wife during a number of high - profile public appearances , something that never happened during his father 's reign			1
in one memorable scene last year , a visibly relaxed and smiling @entity5 and his wife , @entity98 , were filmed taking in the attractions at an amusement park outside the capital			1
he has also shown a willingness to speak publicly , even acknowledging the suffering of his own people during one speech in april last year			2
" our party is determined our people will not have to tighten their belts but will enjoy wealth and the honor of socialism , " @entity5 told a crowd of thousands at @entity107 in @entity13			2
his father is believed to have made only one brief broadcast while in charge			0
" @entity28 basically grew up on @entity118 and his father grew up on letters and stamps , " said @entity5 , founder of @entity117			1
" it 's a new era and @entity28 realizes the more he can kind of shape the narrative to the international community , the more it is to his benefit in terms of getting security and money and everything else that he wants for his country			1
" but despite signs @entity5 could be someone the world can do business with , the recent aggressive posturing and rhetoric emanating from @entity13 suggest otherwise -- with the country 's leadership seemingly united			2
" as far as regime and national security is concerned , there is a unity between hardliners and moderates , " said @entity62			0
" the @entity2 leadership does not think that their behavior is aggressive			0
for example , launching a rocket for peaceful use in space is , they believe , their sovereign right			0
and any aggressive behavior such as the third nuclear test is a rightful reaction to unfair and unjust punishment by the @entity16 and the @entity21 " there seems to be a huge perception gap			0
" meanwhile , little is changing for the people of @entity2			0
aid groups say malnutrition is still rampant in the countryside where citizens lack access to safe water and sanitation			0
according to @entity169 , hundreds of thousands of people remain enslaved in prison camps which are " notorious for horrific living conditions and abuse			0
" the rights group also claims that on taking power @entity5 's new government gave shoot - on - sight orders to border guards to stop citizens fleeing to @entity179			2
@entity0 's @entity180 contributed to this report .			0

new leader @entity28 has stepped out of his late father 's shadow
*presided* over successful rocket launch after humiliation of april failure
like his father , @entity5 has ignored international condemnation
@entity5 is more personable , speaking publicly , appearing with his wife
