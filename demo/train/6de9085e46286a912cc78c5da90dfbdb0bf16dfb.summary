a @entity5 captive dressed in an orange prison - style jumpsuit is seen kneeling in the desert , juxtaposed against a bright blue sky			2
a masked " executioner " lords over him , wielding a large knife			1
the victim 's last words are seemingly scripted by his captors			0
the video fades to black			1
@entity19 has released video in which it executes @entity21 , the third @entity5 captive beheaded by the militant @entity23 group			1
it 's titled a " message to the allies of @entity26 , " similar to what @entity19 called the first two videos			1
the semantics of all three videos have slight differences , but the choreography is strikingly alike			1
@entity35 hostage of @entity19 was helping displaced @entity36 , aid group says the executioner the executioner in the video posted saturday appears to be the same person , speaking in what sounds like the same @entity35 accent as the man who purportedly killed @entity26 journalists @entity44 and @entity46			1
" it sounds , and he looks very much , like the same executioner that we 've seen in the two previous killings , " @entity0 's @entity47 said			1
" that accent there is unmistakably @entity35			0
" the executioner is dressed identically in all three videos ; black garb covering everything almost but his eyes , a leather strap with a pistol			1
in the first two videos , you could see his combat boots , but not in the most recent tape			1
he appears to be of similar build and height			1
he waves a knife in his left hand , as did the militant in the previous two videos			2
the first portion of the video starts off as the other ones did -- with a clip of a @entity5 leader stating his support in the fight against @entity19			1
this time , it is @entity35 prime minister @entity79 explaining his backing of the coalition supporting the @entity82 in northern @entity83			0
before the masked killer takes the life of his captive , he addresses the leader of his victim 's country , referring to recent airstrikes conducted by the @entity26 in @entity83			0
prior to @entity44 's killing , the executioner refers to @entity26 strikes that helped break the siege of the @entity95 in an attempt to rescue the @entity97 trapped there			2
prior to @entity46 's killing , the executioner refers to the strikes that helped break the siege of @entity102 , home to many of @entity83 's @entity106 @entity105			2
this time ? " your evil alliance with @entity26 which continues to strike the @entity111 of @entity83 and most recently bombed the @entity113 dam , will only accelerate your destruction and claim the role of the obedient lap dog , " he said , directing his remarks at @entity35			0
" @entity79 will only drag you and your people into another bloody and unwinnable war			0
" at the end , the executioner threatens the life of another captive -- this time , @entity19 claims it has @entity122 , another abducted @entity35 aid worker			1
" this is stereotypical for what we 've seen , " @entity47 said			0
" unfortunately , this has to be said , that the outlook at the moment for mr. @entity122 is not a strong one			0
" following @entity44 's death , the @entity35 ambassador to the @entity26 said that experts in his country were close to identifying his killer			0
he has not yet been named			0
@entity19 executes @entity21 , @entity79 vows justice questions " the murder of @entity21 is an act of pure evil			1
my heart goes out to his family who have shown extraordinary courage and fortitude , " @entity79 said late saturday			0
" we will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice , however long it takes			0
" in the case of the first two videos , the @entity26 intelligence community has been analyzing them to try to answer some key questions : when were they shot ? where were they shot ? is the killer the same person ? one forensics expert has raised the issue that there appear to be two militants in the @entity44 video			2
the second militant appears on the video after an obvious edit			2
" there 's definitely a change of actor , " said @entity167 , the forensics expert			0
" there are noticeable -- there are subtle -- but there are also noticeable changes in their build , their physical appearance			0
" in the @entity46 and @entity21 video , the picture fades to black immediately before and after the start of the beheading so , again , it 's not immediately clear whether the man speaking is the same man who then killed the journalist			2
who is @entity19 ? statement from family of @entity21 @entity0 's @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192 contributed to this report .			1
