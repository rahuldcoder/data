-- like a viper that slithers through the garden -- mostly unseen , menacing , dangerous -- a troubling trend is taking hold in this country , a movement to shake the foundations of what " born in the @entity9 " means			1
@entity10 was born in @entity11 in 1992			0
she graduated from a @entity11 public high school in 2010 and applied to @entity13 , a four - year state college that required her to disclose her parents ' federal immigration status			1
@entity10 was unable to provide this information , so she was denied admission			0
she then applied to @entity19 to complete a two - year degree			0
when her acceptance letter arrived , there was a catch : she would be required to pay the out - of - state tuition rate			1
how could this be possible when @entity10 had lived her entire life in @entity26 ? as the law stands , all children born in the @entity9 , including those to undocumented immigrants , are granted @entity9 citizenship			1
there are approximately 4.5 million @entity9 children like @entity10 who are @entity9 citizens by virtue of birthright , yet whose parents are undocumented for federal immigration purposes			1
these @entity9 citizen children of undocumented parents are @entity9			2
many will join the military and help fight our wars to keep us safe			0
most of them will someday work and pay @entity47 taxes so our aging population can enjoy a comfortable retirement ( perhaps even in @entity26 )			2
yet politicians seeking to brandish their nativist credentials will do almost anything to discriminate against these @entity9 children , whom they call " anchor babies			2
" one of the most egregious examples of this blatant discrimination -- one such " viper " -- occurs in my home state			0
the @entity26 is the only state that unambiguously denies in - state tuition to @entity9 citizen children of undocumented immigrants			1
( similar cases have arisen in other states , like @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70			0
) this out - of - state classification not only denies these students the preferential treatment in the admissions process that residents usually receive , but it also affects the tuition they must pay as " out of state " students			1
the tuition difference is stunning			0
at @entity19 , the cost per year in the two - year associate degree programs is $ 2,532 for residents , compared to $ 9,047 for students classified as nonresidents			0
the cost per year in the four - year bachelor 's degree program at @entity13 is $ 2,800 for residents , compared to $ 12,492 for nonresidents			0
the net effect is that these students either delay or entirely forgo a college education because they simply ca n't afford the higher tuition			2
this insidious policy excludes talented , qualified young adult citizens from pursuing higher education -- because their parents lack immigration documents			2
such wrongheaded policy has not gone unnoticed			0
the @entity97 filed a federal class action lawsuit in the @entity99 of @entity26 charging systemic discrimination			2
last week , judge k. @entity101 found that @entity26 is violating the constitutional rights of @entity9 - born children of undocumented immigrants by requiring them to pay higher tuition rates than other students at state colleges			1
he said , " it is the plaintiffs who , upon graduating from a post-secondary educational institution , receive their names on diplomas , and it is plaintiffs â € ” not plaintiffs ' parents , cousins , or siblings â € ” who are entitled to the benefits conferred by such a degree			0
" @entity101 was appointed by president @entity123 in 1992 and is known not only for his keen intellect but also for his commonsense jurisprudence			0
nearly 20 years ago he offered me a clerkship to work with him upon graduation from @entity129 and he swore in my @entity131 father as an @entity9 citizen in a private ceremony in his office			2
in his decision last week , his common sense and practical justice was clear ; preferential in - state tuition rates for all @entity26 residents are simply a wise investment in @entity26 's future			1
@entity143 professor @entity142 examined the effect of in - state tuition on enrollment rates at universities in @entity68 , @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 , and compared those rates to 46 other states			1
she concluded that favorable in - state tuition policies resulted in a 31 % increase in college enrollment rates			1
also , graduates of state colleges tend to remain in the @entity26 workforce , where they earn more , pay higher taxes , promote the educational attainment of their own children , vote more , depend less on welfare and live healthier lives			1
@entity26 college graduates will typically earn 66 % more than high school graduates over their working lives			2
these higher earnings mean higher tax payments at the local , state and federal levels			0
a college graduate will likely pay up to 80 % more in taxes each year than someone with no college degree			0
even during periods of high unemployment , those with college degrees re-enter the labor market sooner			0
@entity26 clearly benefits from providing an affordable post-secondary education to all its own high school graduates , regardless of their parents ' immigration status			0
the state 's lawyers argued that " by offering in - state tuition rates to the @entity9 citizens of undocumented immigrants , the state would be forced to offer in - state tuition rates to all @entity9 citizens			1
" but @entity101 said the state 's claim was based on its " flawed interpretation " of the 1996 federal welfare reform law , because the @entity26 students who sued the state " are not ' aliens ' but rather @entity9 citizens			1
" local @entity26 communities benefit , too , from students with a post-secondary education , as the increased salaries of these graduates is predicted to create more than 250,000 jobs and add $ 33 billion to @entity26 's economy over their working lifetime if the state realizes its five goals by 2016			1
if @entity26 wins , the whole country wins , because education increases the productivity of the @entity9 , and the net effect is a rise in the gross national product			1
when one of the most pressing issues of our time -- education -- is seen through the lens of the worldview of those who would call @entity10 an " anchor baby , " denying her what all @entity9 citizens are entitled to , the terrible costs of such a vision become crystal clear			1
the snake in the garden has reared its head -- and fortunately , wisdom has prevailed in the form of judge @entity101 's decision			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity239 .			0

@entity241 : a judge ruled that children of immigrants in @entity26 *deserve* in - state tuition
he says children born in the @entity9 are @entity9 citizens , should n't be treated differently
@entity239 : give young *people* a chance at college and they *'ll* boost the economy
