-- this week there was one particular story from the @entity3 that really seemed to resonate with @entity4 on the @entity5			1
mind you , it had nothing to do with topless photos of @entity10 , the @entity11 , for it seems we 've finally moved on			0
though , i 'm not sure why			0
seriously , when did we all of a sudden become decent human beings , unmoved by the promise of grainy photos of @entity10 's bare chest ? when did we decide that we would boldly shun and forget these images and thus no longer encourage the paparazzi to invade the privacy of foreign royalty ? answer : tuesday			1
when we learned there might be a bacon shortage			1
yes , that 's when everyone here on this side of the pond collectively freaked out over the possibility that we might have to one day hit up the buffet and actually eat fresh fruit -- with all that " nutrition " and " flavor			1
" that was the real tipping point			0
it 's like @entity37 once said , " you can take away our dirty @entity40 smut , but hands off the pork , dude			1
" without question , bacon is the most interesting meat in the world , and if it were capable of original thought , we would n't even be having an election this november in @entity4			1
we would simply appoint bacon as our forever leader and live dutifully under its rule			2
" today , for no apparent reason , i instructed @entity4 troops to invade @entity56			0
" " hooray ! thanks , bacon ! " so , clearly , this was a big deal -- the kind of news that required every ounce of hyperbole i could muster			1
the whole scare actually exploded on social media a couple of days after the @entity67 of the @entity3 ( motto : some swine with your tea ? ) put out a press release ominously stating , " a world shortage of pork and bacon next year is now unavoidable			1
" they might as well have just printed , " jump off a bridge			0
" the report sort of suggested that @entity81 drought conditions were the cause of the upcoming pork shortage -- that unfavorable weather had ruined the corn and soybean crop			1
thus , less feed means fewer @entity81 pigs			1
that , or they 're all just taking a gap year to go backpacking in @entity92			0
" oy , mate , let 's grab a pint and be hyper - critical of the @entity4 pigs staying in our hostel			1
" naturally , it did n't take too long before all hell broke loose on @entity101			2
the great comedian @entity102 led the way : " everyone complaining about replacement refs			2
. we got bigger problems folks ! ! a bacon shortage ! ! * * faints like a vanilla sister * * " @entity102 also once told me in an interview how she hoped gov. @entity113 would join the @entity115 primaries because " fat presidents would get everything done before lunch			2
but now i 'm here to tell everyone in @entity4 to calm down			0
i was totally with you -- the fatty , delicious pork sky was most definitely falling -- but it now seems we 're all going to be just fine			0
at least as far as bacon goes			2
yes , the big scare is over ; it was a misrepresentation of facts at best			0
and @entity132 business and economics correspondent @entity130 does a great job explaining what this all really means in an article he posted wednesday			2
the headline of his story , and the basic takeaway : there will be no bacon shortage			0
but it might cost a little more at the grocery			0
i 'll just dip into my emergency bacon fund			0
people laughed at me when i transferred all my 401 ( k ) money into bacon savings , but who 's the man now , dog ? " you are , @entity153 ! " " hooray ! thanks , bacon ! "			1

apparently this matters is @entity157 's weekly , off - beat look at topics *trending* on social media
this week , @entity162 *reflects* on the @entity40 's brief , *horrible* fear of a bacon - free planet
@entity3 *researchers* had suggested drought would n't leave enough crops to feed the pigs
in other news , bacon would make a great president
